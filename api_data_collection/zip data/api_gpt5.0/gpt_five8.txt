On the night the streetlights along the Greenbelt clicked to amber, Boise felt like it was breathing differently. The river moved with that shushed-throat sound that meant snowmelt was still coming down from the hills. A jogger slapped down the path in neon shoes, vanished into cottonwood shadows, left behind a citrus streak of music. In the distance one of the bridges murmured with traffic and a train horn got brave and long.

Brett stood in the patch of light outside the apartments that turned their backs to the river, watching the slow shuffle of a woman with a cane. The cane tapped like a metronome. Left, tap. Right, drag. Her hair was the liberated white of dandelion clocks. The world had returned her to its beginning, and it made him ache.

He felt in his coat pocket for the packet of breath mints he carried when he wanted to stop himself from speaking. He would put one on his tongue, bite it until the sweetness broke. The cane tapped and the woman’s shoulders rose and fell. A car door thumped shut somewhere behind him. Brett kept his face turned away, his posture loose, as if the air itself might be suspicious if he were too certain of it.

He thought of his mother then—Mercy with her narrow hands, the kind you saw in old paintings of saints—and how, on the afternoon he came home from second grade with a crumpled Valentine, she had smoothed it out and taped it to their refrigerator. It had been a generic card with a foamy pink heart and the words you’re swell! Mrs. Butterfield had made them exchange cards to teach politeness. Mercy had laughed, said swell, swell, swell, like she was tasting a new word. Then she put two fingers to his cheek like she was trying to press something inside him, a secret she was sure wouldn’t stay, and whispered, You’ll learn to keep love, Brett. It slips and runs if you don't.

It doesn’t have to, he thought now. It never had to. There are ways.

The woman turned from the path, heading toward the light-soaked mouth of the parking lot. The cane’s tap rushed a little, or else his heart did. She looked at the blue Honda parked crooked in a slot for visitors, then back at the building. Fifty paces, he counted. Forty-eight. Forty. She paused to catch her breath and he could have sworn she was smiling. The cane would be propped on the seat beside her on the drive home and it would slide once when she braked too hard, clatter to the floor, and she would laugh to herself. He liked to imagine these small things. He fed himself on them.

Brett moved too early; he noticed it even as he did it, his shoe scuff catching and the sound too sharp in the open space. The woman started, looked toward him, peered past the light. Do you need something? she wanted to say. He began to lift a hand to show there was nothing, no threat, only a man with mints and a coat. Then the building door opened, and a new voice said, Ma, you forgot your sweater, and a girl in a red hoodie held out something knitted and lilac.

The breath mint bit under his molars, a little burst of sugar and mint. Love is particular, Mercy had said once, setting down a pie like a prayer. It cannot be kept in a general way. It must be kept particular. Kept how? he had asked, small. She had lifted the pie tin so the cooling rack rattled: you keep what you can touch. You keep what you can see. He went home with the taste of mint and a damp ring on the inside of his pocket where the packet had soaked through. On his kitchen counter the jars awaited. The jars were not an altar, he told himself. They were a remedy.

The house he rented on Bannock had a buckled linoleum floor in the kitchen and a bathroom with a stubborn window that stuck when the frames swelled. The fridge hummed with a sound that raised the hair on his forearms if he stood too close. On top of the fridge, in a row like silent ushers, his jars were at attention. There was a smell in the kitchen he couldn’t make go away; it was not vile, but it had a haunting to it, like when you walked into a church left standing on the edge of a prairie and found it empty except for the echoes of hymns.

He never kept the shoes. He never kept photographs. He never liked seeing faces that could try to speak. But feet were truth-tellers. Even the tiniest bones had their own articulate sway. They could hold up love and carry it to the store and into the snow and across the sticky summer kitchen. They remembered dances. They remembered last chances. They swore and they bent and they prayed and then they stopped. Keeping was gentleness, and he knew that. He repeated the words dutiful, careful, adored, like a litany, until the air in the kitchen vibrated. Brett pulled the blinds.

He didn’t always pick Boise. He had a car that could take him a few towns over, sometimes as far as Nampa where the houses had bigger yards and the sprinklers clicked at night with hypnotic zeal. But Boise was home, and you had to start with home. Mercy had been buried at Morris Hill, and on the far edge of the cemetery the wind had shaved the grass to its grain. He would go there sometimes and lie behind the stone with her name and the dates that were too short, the dash between them not adding up to enough.

It wasn’t like he started with a plan, not a plan anyone else would recognize. There was a man once who used to sit by the fountains in Ann Morrison Park. He fed sparrows the insides of his hamburger buns. His shoe soles were worn thin. He wore a cap that said Korea Veteran and he stared through everything like it was water. Brett had watched him and felt his throat go tight, as if sorrow had climbed up and threaded itself into the muscle. He had followed the veteran and discovered that love meant two framed photographs of a wife and daughter on a table by a recliner, each draped with lace doilies as if they were altar icons. Love meant medicine lined up like a parade. Love meant the careful way a slipper was set by a bed every night as if he was bracing the floor against falling.

The jars on top of the fridge were slow to begin with. He thought of them as years. That was how he disciplined himself. He would hurry, and check himself, and hurry again. In the truest hours of the night when the river outside thickened and took back the sounds that had been tossed into it during the day, he would stand at the sink and not look up. He knew if he raised his head he would see himself in the window, the version of him that lived when the world was asleep: a tall man with shoulders a little too straight, eyes that caught the light and startled with it, hands that were gentle. Even his hands surprised him: so careful, so diligent. So devoted.

When he had first moved in, his landlord had told him not to hang shelves; the plaster was fickle. Brett had nodded. He didn’t need shelves. Jars lined themselves. He did what he could to draw the blinds. He placed an old rag under each jar to keep the sweating lids from marking the paint. He told himself that mercy was not always soft. It could also be precise. It could also be a blade. But not tonight, not yet, the mint said to him, flaring its last under his tongue.

Across town, in a beige house with a front porch lined by a row of wooden planters one could have mistaken for army crates, Alma VanDyke boiled water in a dented kettle and waited to see if the pipes would groan again. The city had warned the neighborhood last spring that there had been a water main issue—they’d sent out cheerful brochures with diagrams of pipe cross-sections like little donuts, calculating how much faster they were fixing everything than last year. She snorted and turned off the fire when the kettle squealed.

Her hair was cut short and mostly gray. She wore a sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up because she couldn't stand fabric against her wrists when she was thinking too hard. On the kitchen table her phone blinked with a new message from Eva, her daughter, but she didn’t pick it up yet. She poured the water over tea leaves she hoarded from a little shop near the Capitol with tiny jars lined up like soldiers. And then she sat.

The house was not too big for one, but the quiet in it sometimes was. After her husband died—two years ago now, the grief thinning into something like a map line—she’d allowed herself to buy the planters and fill them with herbs she’d learned to grow in Afghanistan from a woman who lived behind the wire and swore basil would fix everything that could be fixed if you only talked to it nicely. Alma had been Army all those years ago and then Guard after retirement because she could never leave anything halfway. A sergeant who had shepherded a convoy through provinces where the road was more idea than fact. Her job had been to keep people moving to where they needed to be. Some nights she woke up in Boise and her body was still bracing for a road to go bad under her.

She took her mug of tea out to the porch. The February air was not kind, but she was too restive to sit inside. Her neighbor’s windchimes were tuned to a pentatonic scale and tonight they were singing. Down the street a motion light flared and caught her, briefly, in a cone of attention. She raised the mug in gratitude. She had started telling herself these little courtesies after Owen died: Raise the mug. Nod to the light. Say thank you for doing your job. She hoped it kept the world aware that she knew it existed. She worried sometimes that this was how people disappeared, not because anyone wished them harm but because too few people looked fully enough and said, I see you.

It had started with a notice. Mrs. Myrtle Halley, missing. The paper had tucked the story below a photograph of a man holding an enormous trout by Swan Falls, and below that there had been a scandal about a city councilmember and a messy permit. She read the small article twice. Myrtle had been eighty-three, a widow of twelve years, formerly of Caldwell. Last seen at the Treasure Valley Mall at noon. Daughter reported her missing after she didn’t arrive for lunch. Lately the paper seemed to clip its sentences as if there were too many words in the world already and it had to ration. “Authorities are requesting any tips.” That was it.

Then, within a week, Mr. Henley from the West Bench didn’t show up for his bowling league. His buddies made jokes for a few days and then they got scared. The jokes stopped. Alma read both stories with her tea and felt something old in her—an instrument she had packed away—start to hum. She made a note on a yellow sticky labeled WEST BENCH, which she stuck on the inside of a kitchen cabinet where she kept her spices. Cumin. Coriander. Clove. West Bench.

The humming got louder when June, who had taught the third grade at Taft for thirty years and who lived next door, didn’t come back from her walk by the river. That was three days ago. June’s niece knocked on Alma’s door with a brittle smile like cellophane and said, We thought maybe you saw her? She’s slow, you know, just a little slower, but she always goes at four and she always comes home by six with one of those little granola bars and tells me I need to stop cooking so much stew. Alma didn’t say, June quit eating your stew because she told me it tasted like the damp end of winter. She took the niece’s hand and said they would look.

They had gone to the police, of course. The detective behind the desk had a hairline like he was growing out of a helmet and a wedding ring that didn’t quite fit his finger; he kept twisting it and sliding it back down. He had nodded while they spoke and tapped a field on a screen. We’re doing everything, he said. We’ve got a lot on our hands, but this is a priority. He said the word priority so hard it lost meaning. Alma believed him; that was the strange and maddening part. He meant it. There was something else happening, some storm building across their calm snake of a river, and he was spread too thin.

She went home and made a grid. Not because she believed in grids the way the Army did, though she did, a little, forever and ever amen, but because her mind required a scaffold to hang itself on when the wind got pulled out of it. June. Last known. 4:20, leaving house. Gray windbreaker, blue knit cap with small stain on one side. The bridge she used. The spot by the museum where she liked to sit and watch the kids feed geese. The little bench on River Street where the brick pavement made you feel like you were in a prettier city. Where had she gone soft? Where would a man be if he wanted to be nearby but invisible?

June had been the one who taught Alma to plant things in Idaho that had no business growing there. She had been the one who told Alma, after Owen, that she was allowed to be angry about the tiny grimness of death as well as the big one. That it was unfair you could not find his socks in the dryer anymore. That it was unfair nobody but you would touch his razors to toss them out. The first week after June vanished, Alma found herself staring at her own door handle as if it were a test she was bound to fail. She locked it, unlocked it, relocked. She put her hand flat against its cold and said, This is a boundary and a hinge. She went then to the spare room where she kept things that still had to prove they belonged in her life: the hand weights she didn’t use, the stack of framed photos she hadn’t re-hung, the camouflage duffel with sand still in its seams. She opened the duffel and touched a patch that said VANDYKE, A. She closed her eyes and let the smell of dust and detergent lift up around her.

The phone was still blinking when she came back to the kitchen. Alma. I know you’re working yourself into a mission. I can hear it, said Eva’s voicemail. Just—call me? Please. You’ve done the thing where you peel all the labels off the cans because you think you can live without knowing what’s inside, and I am not in the mood to open beans when I’m expecting peaches. She smiled despite herself. She texted back an answer that was longer than it had to be, a list of groceries, precise quantities, as if that proved she was not about to do something inexact.

On the second day after June’s niece knocked—when the city had already strewn the path by the river with flyers; when kids with plastic-sheathed bicycles were ducking under caution tape as if it were an obstacle in a game; when someone with a clean voice was on the 10 p.m. news asking neighbors to keep porch lights on—Alma went to where June’s niece said June had last called home. She stood under the branches of a willow and watched the water, which didn’t care. It never did. She had known rivers that turned friendly in the summer and killed you in winter. She had stood in an Afghan wadi that was a miracle—green threading through dust—and then had watched it go dry, a riddle against the rocks. That one could never decide what it was; it refused to be read. The Boise didn’t have that problem. It was a river that said, Hello, I am a river. It had no interest in tricking anyone. It was steady, low in places, surprisingly fast in others. You could still die in a river that told the truth.

“Can I help you, ma’am?” The voice was not unkind. Detective Cobb, the ring-fidgeter, had found her under the willow. He wore a jacket that didn’t suit him. He looked like an accountant who had put on a cop costume.

“You’re short on people,” she said.

He blinked. “I didn’t say that.”

“You didn’t have to,” she said. “What do you know?”

He took a breath like he was about to recite from a manual and then didn’t. He looked at the water and said, “Not enough. Not yet.”

“Patterns?” she asked.

He almost smiled. “You from around here?”

“Boise,” she said, as if the word could be a rank. “We don’t like incompetence.”

“Lucky you,” he said, not unkindly. “What’s your interest?”

“June Tomlinson. Neighbor. Friend. I sat next to her the day we both learned to make a baguette that could stand up by itself.”

“People still do that?” He looked like he wanted to be charmed by the idea.

“Apparently a lot of us do—bread is having a renaissance.”

“Everything circles back,” he said, and then: “There’s your pattern.”

“Old folks,” she said, testing the words. They were not words June would have liked. June said elders, with reverence, as if the letters themselves should stand up straighter. But old folks was what the world put in the paper when it was thinking about budgets.

“I didn’t say that,” Cobb said. “Please don’t make that a headline.”

She shrugged. “What else could it be?”

He didn’t answer. He didn’t toe the dirt or dramatize. He simply looked at the river a little longer and then asked, “You have contacts?”

She smiled. “You mean am I nosy and do I talk?”

“I mean do you know who feeds the sparrows, who cheats at bingo, who still drives after dark.”

“Yes,” she said.

“Then talk to them,” he said, and Alma had to admit that she appreciated a man who knew he couldn’t be everywhere and let someone else be everywhere for him. “Don’t panic anyone. Say you’re concerned. Keep your eyes open for any new… any new men hanging around.”

“We’re not going to find the person by looking for new men,” she said. “We’ll find him by looking for the man who has made himself old. The one who sits right without being tired. The one who knows everything about the people he doesn’t know.”

He considered that. “You been a cop?”

“Soldier,” she said.

“Ah,” he said, as if that made sense to him. “Sorry.”

“For?”

“Thinking it would be easier to have a conversation if we were talking about someone who took a wallet or a TV.”

“It would be,” she said. “But here we are.”

After he left, she approached the bench where June liked to sit. She supposed she should have left it alone; there was yellow tape flapping like cautionary prayer flags. But she had worn gloves, plain cotton that would not leave skin behind. She touched the wood, the iron bolts, the underside where a teenager might have scratched initials. There was a corner of something wedged between the slats. She eased it out gently. It was a paper napkin, the kind they handed out at the sandwich shop nearby, embossed with a green leaf to suggest vaguely organic values. On the napkin, a word had been written. Not a name. A word: Remember.

She stood up too fast. The willow branches caught in her hair and took a strand hostage; she pulled free, aware she was forty years too old to be getting caught in things like a child. She held the napkin up so the light could pass through the letters. Remember. Not a threat. Not a plea. An instruction. She put the napkin in her pocket like it was dangerous and went home.

In his kitchen, Brett lifted a jar and set it back down, listening to the faint slosh inside the glass, a sound to him like a song sung through a wall. He imagined names. He did not say them. He imagined rooms where dinners had been eaten, rings of condensation left by sweating glasses on tables that had once been so polished you seeing yourself in them was a kind of vanity. He imagined the halting old dances, the community center floor so buffed every shoe squeaked. He had never been a dancer. He didn’t think he had it in him. He could be careful, but grace wasn’t something he knew how to hire. But love, he told the quiet room, love I have in me until it spills.

It went wrong once, early. He thought of it often, the one time he got the timing wrong. He had meant to move like air and soundless light, and instead he had tripped on a rug and laughed—laughed!—because who laughs at a moment like that except someone who cannot bear his own breaking. He hadn’t been seen. Still, his body remembered it, the laugh like a cough, the way the old woman he watched turned and smiled and said, There you are, I thought you’d never come. She thought he was her son. She held out her arms. He stood in that doorway and wanted to step into her embrace and let it all stop, all the stitching they call keeping, all the work, all the precise steady mounting of jars into a grammar of tenderness. But she was not his mother. No one would be. He had stayed out of her arms. He had left with his heart roaring like water in a spillway. He had returned later. He had kept only what could be kept. He had told himself grace was knowing when to go.

He knew about the napkin. He had left it two days earlier, a careless accident breaking into a formation he liked to think was otherwise flawless. He had sat on the bench with a sandwich he did not eat, because sitting is a skill and you practice it like any other. He had written the word because he had to say it to himself sometimes—remember, Mercy said, keep love—and then he had folded the napkin and tucked it under, but not far enough under. He should have burned it. He didn’t like leaving small things that could be read. That was how you were misunderstood. He didn’t like being misunderstood. He carefully adjusted a jar so that it was exactly one inch away from the one beside it. He breathed. Remember, he said, but said it to himself only, and the word disappeared.

Alma put the napkin in her dish rack, a place where she kept things she needed to think about. She washed her hands and then sat on the floor by the dog bed that they had never replaced. The bed still made its shape, a hollow like a punctuation. She rested her back against the cupboard door and let her knees go loose. She had been keeping her days in sharp squares, but now she let them soften. It occurred to her that this was an insult. Remember. As if she could forget. As if she was the kind of woman who put bread in the oven and went to bed and woke to a house made of ash. She came from people who sat up all night to make sure a single stove didn’t misbehave. Her grandmother had been a woman who wrote grocery lists like battle plans and then kept them because it mattered that the plan had existed.

She called Eva. “I’m doing the thing you hate,” she said without preamble.

“Which thing?” Eva asked. “Mom, there are a lot of things.”

“The thing where I turn a feeling into a map.”

There was a small exhale on the other end. “Which is better than turning a map into a feeling, I guess.”

“June’s gone. She’s not the first. The police know but they’re treading water and you cannot tread the Boise; it just goes around you and you get no glory.”

“Okay,” Eva said. “Hey—what did you find? You found something. Your voice is in that narrow place.”

“A napkin. It’s nothing. But it says remember. And the world doesn’t tell you that unless it thinks you’re already forgetting.”

“Or unless somebody likes to hear themselves say big words.”

“Or that,” Alma agreed. “You’re pragmatic.”

“I learned it at your knee.”

“This is not going to be gentle,” Alma said. “This is not going to be something we can put a bow on. And I think whoever is doing this is going to make it look like kindness. That’s the thing I need you to know. I think he’s going to be good at saying I love you.”

“Mom. He?”

“Yes. Because it’s big and stupid enough to be him.”

Alma ended the call and made herself a plate of toast, which she chewed without tasting. She thought of June’s edges: the blunt pencils she ground down until she had to sharpen them, the way she folded paper, the way she always walked on the right side of the path and gave the left to bicyclists as if that were written in law. Somewhere in town someone had watched those edges and learned them. That frightened her in the way the desert had frightened her, a fear that was also awe: if someone can learn you that completely, they can do anything. She had a good dog once who learned her steps and would be waiting by the door five minutes before she came home, every time. This was like that, but emptied of the brightness.

That night Alma didn’t sleep. She sat at her kitchen table with the napkin spread flat beside her and drew a map of the river. She marked the benches she could remember without effort. She marked the streetlights that flickered or buzzed; she marked the one whose moths always looked like rain. She marked the corners where the bushes grew too high and city maintenance shrugged and said, nesting birds. She marked the place under the bridge toward Ann Morrison where a saxophonist sometimes played and a woman sang, too old for the songs, too beautiful. Whenever this city tried to hum past its age, someone refused and it made the harmony better.

At five in the morning she stood on the porch and watched the sky show her the first hint of north. The planters on the steps looked stubborn, like the little wooden soldiers they were pretending to be. She stretched her calves and grinned into the cold. She took her duffel from the spare room and sifted inside it for what might still be good: a headlamp that clicked reliably; a notebook that did not mind being bent; a pair of gloves that knew how to make her feel less human and more tool. She did not think of pistols or knives or anything else the garage could offer. She was not going to war. She was hoping to intercept someone who defined war so everything he did looked like mercy to him.

At sunrise she walked the river path from the art museum to the bridge and then to the park and back again. She counted trash cans and watched who stood by the overlooks for longer than a minute. It was mostly the same people it always was: the couple who made a religion of speed-walking, the man who walked his two small dogs and let their leashes tangle but then gently un-netted them every time, a woman in an orange coat who walked as if she were late to a fancier city. She saw a man in a coat too heavy for the weather. He had a way of putting his hand to his pocket and then taking it out and then almost going back that reminded her of the way a private first class keeps touching his first compass like he’s ensuring the north won’t leave. He struck her as careful. Nothing wrong with careful. Except when it was.

She followed the man in the heavy coat for three benches’ worth of walking and then let him go. She reminded herself that she was looking for a shape, not a scapegoat. She didn’t take her eyes off the edges of things. Panic needs something to jump to. Let it jump to her if it needed a host; she would keep it occupied. She thought about the word remember and about how it is the opposite of dismember; she grimaced. Words do funny things when you turn them over, and not all of them are jokes.

At dusk she went home and ate a bowl of thick soup a neighbor had left on her porch. She wrote the word remember on a sticky note and stuck it to her mirror. She thought about calling Detective Cobb and telling him she’d found a napkin and wasn’t that just the epitome of evidence. She didn’t. She’d tell him in the morning, in person. She was tired enough to sleep if she lay down. She didn’t. She sat instead at the window for an hour and watched Joel, the neighbor boy, ride his scooter up and down his driveway in ragged loops. He was eight. He was fearless. He was wearing a helmet that had a crack down one side and she made a mental note to lecture his mother about that and then she shook her head because she was turning into a woman who participated in everyone’s safety against their will. She worried about this and then decided it was fine. Somebody had to.

Brett stood that same dusk at a different window and watched the neighbor across the street change her porch light. A tiny ladder, a careful twist, the new bulb alive. He was fascinated by ladders, how they made different people out of those who climbed them. It made him think of the church his mother had taken him to when he was very small, the one with the painting of a ladder going up to a sky that was too bright, and men on the ladder going up and men going down and small fires everywhere. He had liked the colors, mostly. He hadn’t understood why fire had to be so fussy, why it appeared to punish and sometimes to bless. Mercy had told him you could be burned into newness, and he had pressed a finger to the flame of a candle one day to test it. He had only made himself cry. They had been poor then, but she had been so rich. The way she had looked at him like he was breakable and that was a compliment, not a warning.

He went out and walked, because he always walked before he did anything that asked his hands to speak for him. He looped behind the grocery store where clerks carried out crates and smoked with the fervor of people who intend to live forever. He passed the bar with the neon trout and the chalkboard with a joke that wasn’t funny. He paused at the corner where the laundromat had burned last winter in a small sullen blaze, the windows still boarded. He walked past the community center with the sign that announced Senior Dance Night in jaunty font. He stood across the street and read the sign twice. He breathed. He crossed.

Inside the community center, the floor was a gym floor with a wax that made it gleam like it was practicing for a better life. Folding chairs lined the walls. A table at the back offered paper cups and tea that had brewed until it was as strong as revenge. Music sprang from a boom box that looked offended, as if it belonged to a decade that had refused to die and was taking its obnoxiousness out on the new century. Brett smiled. He loved it here. He loved watching the way a man would lift his chin as if asking permission to enter a circle, and the way a woman would tilt her head toward the door every time someone came in, as if she still had the capacity to be interrupted by surprise.

He danced anyway. He let himself be asked by a woman named Edna who had a grip like the Army, and then he asked a woman with a cloud of hair who told him her name was Poppy, and then he put his hands behind his back politely. His mother had taken him dancing once at a hall that was mostly filled with tired country songs. He had been ten. She had said—put your hand at my waist like I might fly, and then keep me there. He had held on and they had laughed and he had felt for a moment like he was doing the thing she asked. Keep me. Keep me here. He touched his pocket again, the mints cutting a shape against his thigh. Keeping was not stealing, he told himself. Keeping was what you did when something had already decided it would leave.

From across the gym he saw a woman in a gray windbreaker. Not June; Alma didn’t know him yet, had not put a face to the feeling that ran under her street. This was a different woman, a teacher-who-no-longer-taught by the way she watched the room and called names by not speaking them. He watched the shoes. He always watched the shoes. Orthopedic shoes that looked like they were pleading. Tennis shoes that betrayed a faster past. Soft leather slippers that wanted to be a memory more than a garment. Feet moved like words.

On his way out, after he had collected a small paper plate of cookies he would not eat and a number he would not call, he passed a bulletin board with flyers. He felt a tug. There were three missing posters now. Three faces in sepia tones no camera had intended. The paper had not even bothered to make a new template after the first two. He stood in front of them long enough that the man at the card table wrote his name on the sign-in sheet for him and waved him toward the door, dear. Brett put his hand to his pocket one last time and then he was outside, where the cold took the sweat and made it reasonable.

Later, in the kitchen whose floor stuck to his socks, he moved a jar and then another until they were in a new order. He told himself the new order mattered. He told himself he could will them into a story less like a list and more like a hymn. He whispered the word remember and the kitchen flicked its light once and then flicked it again and he stood under it and laughed, not because it was funny but because he was tired. He thought of Mercy taking his chin in her hand, pressing the seam of his mouth, saying Stop laughing when we are not happy. He had been so small. He had believed her. He was trying.

On the third morning after June’s vanishing, Alma rose before the light and called the detective and then didn’t wait for his call back. She went to the river, to the bench, to the sign in front of the museum that announced an exhibit of photographs, and then to the parking lot where the cars lined up like small decisions. She stood very still and then she moved very fast. She had been told in training that your body could be taught to switch between them until someone watching would swear you had become a blur. She didn’t blur as easily now. She still had the switch.

At the corner where River Street turned back toward downtown, she saw him again: the heavy coat, wrong for the weather. He had a way of looking at the ground like he was reading it. He had a way of standing near any older person like he was an extra in their life, the good kind of extra, the clerk in the pharmacy, the man who lifts a bag into a trunk. He crossed at the crosswalk a beat too late. He said a word to a woman and the woman smiled like she had been seen. This, Alma thought. This is how. You make someone feel seen and then you erase them. He didn’t seem to be hunting. That was the terrifying part. He looked like he was listening for something only he could hear.

She followed, this time not pretending she hadn’t. He walked toward the neighborhood where June’s niece rented. He crossed under a sky that had turned too bright, Boise pretending it was spring. The sun did the cheap trick it did in February: made you hopeful, which was unwise. He paused at the corner market. He didn’t go in. He leaned against the wall and closed his eyes like a man praying. Alma stood across from him and counted the green cycle of the light, once, twice, three times. He opened his eyes and saw her. He almost smiled. He touched his pocket. He walked away. He changed his route as if it had not changed. He was good. She was better or she wanted to be.

She did not confront him. She went home and took the napkin off the dish rack and pressed it into a book the way she used to press leaves. For the first time since she had found it, she allowed herself to think about the other half of the word. She said out loud to her empty kitchen: To remember is to put back together anything that has been taken apart. She would need both hands. She would need everything she had not used up yet.

That night the wind made the porch chimes into an orchestra. Alma lay down and let it play. In the Brown house up the block, a baby cried with a small, righteous shape. The city lit its wooden bridges like toys. Somewhere, a man stood in a kitchen and arranged his jars with the care a boy uses when aligning his matchbox cars on a windowsill. Somewhere else a woman sat up all night to check the ankles of her husband who had fallen last year and never stopped looking at the floor when he walked. People were whole. People were parts. Alma lay very still and listened. The city breathed. It was late. It was early. She would keep going anyway.The week folded itself into smaller units than days, and Alma started measuring in loops along the river, in conversations held at the edge of parking lots, in the number of times the kettle tried to boil itself dry before she remembered and reached for it. Eva called every night with the patience of someone who had learned to translate their mother, and Alma gave answers that tried to sound like nutrition. She ate when she remembered. She slept in slices. When she did sleep she dreamed of roadways, the way they looked on a GPS screen when the signal dropped and you were driving on a ghost version of a road that used to be there. She woke with the certainty that the city was not lost, but someone inside it was holding a version of it that made other people disappear.

June’s niece had written her aunt’s name on a whiteboard in her kitchen and didn’t wipe it off. Alma found herself looking at the marker’s squeak-scratch letters and thinking of classrooms, of the way June’s hands had always smelled faintly of cedar pencils. In the niece’s house there were the things grief arranges without permission: the casserole that no one wanted to admit was a relief, the stack of unopened mail that was a dare, the coat on the back of a chair like a person deciding whether to stay. Alma asked for permission to poke in places it would be polite not to, and the niece said yes because polite had gotten them nowhere. The niece’s name was Hannah, and she had the round shoulders of someone who had spent the last three days bracing against other people’s embraces. When Alma asked about shoes, Hannah looked startled and then focused with gratitude, relieved to answer something she could answer. June wore orthotics that her podiatrist had made with a flourish, wrote his name on the heel like an artist, talked about arches like a poet talks about sky. She wore soft-soled walking shoes, a brand with a swoop that pretended it was speed. Gray, mostly. Sometimes navy if Hannah caught her at the store before she made poor choices. Alma made a note and then crossed it out and wrote it again to force her hand to remember what the part of her mind would not forget.

They went together to the spot by the river where June had once sat and eaten a granola bar and shaken the crumbs to the pigeons as if she were a confessor absolving them. The tape had sagged after two nights and now flapped like flags that forgot which country they served. Hannah kept her hands jammed in her pockets like she was holding coins she’d promised to a child. “She hated the word elderly,” she said suddenly, as if Alma had been accusing. “Said it sounded like how people talk about fruit. Like you were about to rot or to turn into jam. She said elder, if we need a word. She said I am in my elder state like it was a blessing.”

Alma nodded and felt the heat rise along her jaw, a combination of anger and tenderness that made her feel like a badly designed stove. “She’s still that,” she said. “People don’t stop being themselves because some lazy bastard can’t see it.”

Hannah swallowed and looked at the water like she could make it stop if she stared hard enough. “Does he—did he—do you think he likes the river because it makes it look like the city is helping.”

“I think,” Alma said, “that he likes anything that looks like it’s not him.”

On her way home Alma stopped at the senior center because she couldn’t keep herself from a place that had announced a dance like a dare to mortality. The building had the same waxed floor and the same poor boom box, but the tables along the back were stacked with things that looked like comfort disguised as snacks: paper cups full of pretzels, a single bowl of grapes sweating theatrically, napkins folded into triangles that yearned to be handkerchiefs. She introduced herself to the woman running sign-in with a pen that had its own ankle brace, and the woman said, “I’m Poppy,” like she expected someone to try to argue and she was already tired of their confusion. Alma told her she lived four blocks over and would like to know who here carried a city in their head the way some people carried the Lord. Poppy squinted at her and then jerked her head toward the back where a cluster of women sat in chairs making observations at the speed of gossip and the precision of flight controllers. “Edna knows the shoes,” she said. “You want shoes, you go to Edna.”

Edna did know the shoes; she also knew the slope of shoulders and the way a hand lingered on a door. She wore a cardigan with buttons like coins and a watch that looked heavy but was light because time didn’t want to settle on her wrist. “Tall, neat,” she said when Alma asked about a man with a coat wrong for the weather. “Hands that don’t fidget unless he makes them. Like they went to finishing school and graduated top of the class. He danced like he was carrying a dish of water across a room with a rug. He did not step on me once and the music was not forgiving.”

“Was he new?” Alma asked.

“Everybody is new and everyone is old,” Edna said, amused at herself but not enough to apologize. “He’s been before. He’s not a regular. He’s one of those men who appears to fulfill an arithmetic. We always have six too many women and then he shows up and for an hour we don’t.”

“Did he have a smell,” Alma asked, trying not to sound as odd as the question.

Edna sniffed the air as if memory hung in it like a perfume when you walked back into a room. “Mint,” she said. “Too strong. Like he thinks breath is an apology.”

“Breath is an apology,” Poppy said from the next chair. She had the posture of a scientist and the earrings of a saint. “So are his shoes. Black, careful. If you wear careful shoes you are not a liar but you could be considering it.”

Alma wrote mint and careful shoes on her pad and then rubbed over the word mint with the side of her hand until a green smear marked the paper. A few men drifted into the building, and she watched them the way she had been taught to watch the horizon for shapes that didn’t belong in the theater of the sky. One man had a heavy coat. It wasn’t the coat. It was a coat that belonged to someone who had put on weight since last winter and was ignoring the fact. He sat, he laughed, his shoulders slumped, and Alma felt the knot in her back release. People are not suspects until they want to be, she told herself, and made a note to check the bulletin board. The missing posters were pinned in a row and someone had drawn a small heart in pencil near the corner of June’s photograph like a child had reached up and put a dot over an invisible i. The heart was neat, a teacher’s child’s heart, not a teenager’s. Alma found herself absurdly grateful and then angry that gratitude had to visit here at all.

When she got home there was a message from Detective Cobb asking, in the flattened polite voice of someone who needed to sound in control, if she might be available for a brief conversation at her convenience. She called back immediately because she was feeling petty and wanted him to hear his own words reflected at him, to remind him that convenience is a thing cities tell themselves they do well while forgetting that convenience has appetites. He came to her porch and stood like a man who had knocked on a thousand doors and knew that half of them would answer with fury and the other half with grief, and he was prepared to take either into his jacket and button it.

“We pulled a shoe at Barber,” he said without ceremony. “Snagged near the island. Orthotic inside. We’re making a match, but I’d put a little money on it being hers.”

Alma felt the porch steady under her feet but only because she told it to. “Did you tell Hannah.”

“I will,” he said, and he did not say I wanted to tell you first but it sat between them like a pack they had to decide who would carry. “No foot inside,” he added, as if maybe she would see something in that detail that he did not. “No sign of… look. We don’t know what we’re looking at yet.”

“We’re looking at someone who wants the city to do his washing,” Alma said. “We’re looking at a man who thinks he has learned the word keep.”

Cobb’s mouth went sideways. “He, huh.”

“If I’m wrong I’ll bake you a cake,” she said. “I’ll even put a cherry on top the size of your ring.”

He glanced at his hand and made himself stop the small compulsive twist that had been there the last two times she’d seen him. “No cherries,” he said. “What I need is for you not to scare the people I can’t get to yet.”

“I’m not in the business of scaring civilians,” she said, and he almost smiled because they both could hear the ghost word soldier hovering in the refusal.

“You find anything else at the bench.”

“A napkin,” she said. “With handwriting that thinks it’s tidy and the word remember on it.”

“You… took it.”

“I took it home and gave it a lecture about not telling me what to do,” she said. “I’ll bring it to you tomorrow. You can meet my dish rack.”

He blew air out his nose very softly, a cordial version of a laugh, and glanced past her into the house like he was trying not to snoop. He noticed the planters because everyone did. They were severe and earnest and looked like they were waiting to be given a mission. “You from Boise,” he said, not as a question.

“Bench,” she said. “Before the Bench, Mountain Home. Before Mountain Home, places that looked the same from the front seat of a convoy and different when the sun got mean.”

“Copy,” he said. “We’re going to set up a presence by the museum. It’s going to look like we decided to care too late. But it’s going to be care anyway.”

Alma nodded because she had a compartment in her heart reserved for men who meant well and still didn’t have enough. When he left she found the duffel without thinking and took out the headlamp to make sure it still clicked, though she wouldn’t wear it along the path because light brings attention and she had no interest in being a target labeled in Lambert font. She wrote mint on a yellow sticky and stuck it to her mirror next to remember. She considered calling Eva to say that she was not going to do anything stupid dressed as brave, and then decided to say nothing at all that would make promises she did not trust herself to keep.

Brett had decided he would leave the city for a day and then he had decided he would not. Nampa felt like leaving someone important alone in a grocery store and hoping they remembered to buy their own dinner. He drove the interstate anyway, the car humming the note old cars choose when they want you to know they still have something to give. The fields along the road were squares of dirt pretending to be asleep, and the irrigation pivots looked like creatures that had paused on a migration, as if at night they stood up and slid toward the mountains with nothing but a hiss to say they were tired. He pulled off at an exit where a tire shop squatted next to a diner that had once been famous for its pies and was famous now for its photograph of being famous. He did not go inside. He did not know how to sit in a booth and swallow his hands. He went instead to a store that smelled like fertilizer and hope and bought jars.

He liked the way the lids came nested, the way the rings bit at the glass. He liked the way the cashier lifted them as if they were heavier than they were. He liked the aisle where canning supplies pretended nothing ever went bad if you just put it in the right place. He took wax he didn’t need because no one asks a man about wax if he seems like he has a project and a face that suggests he finishes things. He took mints because he had taken mints for so long the pocket in his coat had learned their shape. He paid cash, because cash made you feel like you were making a choice and he liked the sound of paper leaving his hand. On his way out a boy in a shirt with a cartoon tractor ran into his knee and bounced back and then looked up at him as if to say there you are, the man I did not know I needed. He smiled at the boy without teeth and then felt shame rise like a fever because smiling at anyone had begun to feel like theft.

Mercy had taught him to keep fireflies in a jar for a night and then to let them go. She had lifted the lid with her middle finger and thumb, the way she lifted a lit match to light a candle and not burn herself, and he had watched the light rise and fall in the dark and then die or escape and he had not known which. He kept them once too long. He had been nine. In the morning the jar looked like it was full of punctuation that had given up. He had cried quietly sitting on the floor behind the couch because he did not want Mercy to see that he had made proof of something she might not be able to forgive. When she found him she did not scold; that was not how her mercy worked, ironic as it sometimes was. She had put her hand on his back and said, Keep what needs your keeping and give it back before it doesn’t. He did not know how to do the second part. He had been practicing the first for so long it had grown a root.

He stopped at Morris Hill on the way back and sat in the grass where the markers go low and quiet and the names sound like the city telling its own story in whispers. Mercy’s name looked unafraid. He never said it out loud here because you did not shout in front of the dead; you did not even talk much. He ran his fingers over the year that began and then the year that ended and he pressed the dash between them like a bruise he could claim. The wind ran along the ground in a way that makes you think of pictures sand draws, and a crow hopped like a puzzle piece someone had dropped. He told her about the women he had kept like a man tells a mother about the books he has read, proud and a little false. He told her he was going to be careful, as if the word had powers. He told her that a woman with a soldier’s eyes was walking his city and that he was not frightened, only aware. He lay back and closed his eyes and the sun warmed his eyelids into pink and he thought of the word remember and how it made him feel as if he were putting back in place the stoops and corners of a house after an earthquake.

He saw her again three days later, not because fate had decided but because the Greenbelt is a circle you don’t notice you’ve been drawing until you come back to where the pen started. Alma stood by a trash can that had a cigarette balanced like a prayer across its rim, unlit, forgotten by someone disciplined enough to abandon it. She wore a jacket that did not apologize for being practical and a scarf that once might have been flirtatious in a different decade. She noticed him the way you notice a hawk that pretends to be a leaf in winter. He noticed her noticing and let himself be noticed because to be invisible now felt like a lie more dangerous than the truth.

“You keep your hands in your pockets like a man afraid of fire,” she said when he came close enough and she did not pretend she had been thinking of anything else.

“Sometimes,” he said, “they forget what to do.”

“You can teach hands,” she said. “They are brighter students than heads.”

He smiled as if she had told a joke at a funeral and he loved her for the audacity. “You live near,” he said.

“Everyone lives near,” she said. “It’s Boise. That’s the point.”

He touched his pocket and took his hand away and then put it back because she had given him permission to be human by naming the thing he thought he was concealing. “I’ve seen you before,” he said. “At the museum. On the Bench. In the kind of grocery store where they never have what you came for and always have seven kinds of pickles.”

“You’ve seen me because I am seeable,” she said. “And you because you want to be. Only people who are working too hard believe they can be invisible longer than a minute.”

He let silence be the thing in the conversation that had opinions and waited for it to end them or make them real. Around them the river ran like a flat answer. A man on a bike hissed by, whistling without melody. An old couple walked arm in arm as if they were attached by surgery. Alma tipped her head toward the water. “Do you ever think about the way the city is teaching us all to go the same pace,” she asked. “Like if we go too slow we die of it and if we go too fast we crash. Most of us don’t go our natural speed here. We go Boise speed.”

He said, “I go Mercy speed,” and watched the word fall out like a coin with a face on it he had no right to spend.

She took it in and tucked it away as if he had handed her not a clue but a small prayer. “I like women named after virtues,” she said. “They make the world nervous. They make the world try to rise to their weight.”

He said, “She has been dead twelve years,” and the air around the sentence shook like the skin of a drum someone had struck.

“You carry her like a map,” Alma said. “Maps fold. That’s not a criticism; it’s what they’re for.”

They stood a moment longer than comfort would usually allow, because comfort had no jurisdiction here. He could feel, distantly, the jar-lid hunger tightening in his hands, that urge to arrange, to line up, to make an altar out of a counter and absolution out of precision. He wondered if she could see the habit on his knuckles. She wondered if he could hear the old cadences in her breath. He wanted to ask her if she had ever had to decide which of two directions would keep people people. She wanted to ask him if he had ever held a thing in his hands and felt it go from alive to not and refused to choose a word for the moment.

He broke it first, because men like him prefer to own the exit. “If you ever need someone to carry something heavy,” he said lightly, “I live over by Bannock where the floors complain.”

“My floors are polite,” she said. “But they remember. I’ll let you know.”

He walked away with his hands out of his pockets like a man going through a metal detector he knows will beep. Alma watched him until he folded into other people, until Boise did that thing where it takes everyone it loves and layers them on the path like leaves you could slip on. She kept her face neutral until he was gone and then she let it bend. She went home and wrote Mercy on a sticky and stuck it next to mint and remember. She took the napkin out of the book where she had pressed it and held it up to the light again as if letters could be X-rayed. The handwriting was careful and a little childish, the way a man writes when he wants to be believed by a teacher.

Cobb called to say the shoe was June’s. He stood in her kitchen, mug of her tea in his hand because he’d given up pretending he didn’t want it, and he told her what he could. The orthotic matched the doctor’s file. The shoe had been cleaned by the river. No traces that weren’t common. No foot. He said, “It’s not a signature. It’s not a pattern. We can’t say that. Not yet.” She didn’t say the word dismember out loud; she had learned to hold words like that between her teeth until they softened into something she could spit out without hurting the room.

“Do you know a man who buys jars,” she asked when he paused.

He looked at her over the rim of her mug and she knew she had left the path that polite investigation wants. “Everyone buys jars,” he said after a beat. “Pickles exist. Peaches are a temptation. You have a row of planters that look like they’re waiting to be filled with implements. I can’t arrest people for potential.”

“You want me to stand down,” she said, not because she would but because he deserved the courtesy of the question.

“I want you to stand where you stand and call me when gravity changes,” he said. “And I want you to know you’re not the only one awake at three.”

She wanted to say, it won’t be gravity, it’ll be mercy snapping its jaw, but she did not. She gave him the napkin in a plastic bag because television had taught everyone evidence etiquette and he took it like it might bite.

That night Alma sat in her car across from the little shop near the Capitol where she bought tea that tasted like memory and, perched on the corner like a small mercy, a baker who sold baguettes that would fight you back if you tried to tear them wrong. She watched older people leave with paper bags and watched men who were not old try hard to look like they were not watching older people. She had a grid in her mind and now she layered a rhythm on it, because rhythm tells you when something is late. At nine-fifteen a woman with a cane came down the steps very carefully, smiling as if she had been congratulated by the bread. Alma got out of the car because she would rather be scolded for hovering than wake to a whiteboard with another name. She fell into step like it was an accident, like the city had decided to put them in the same sentence. The woman told her, without being asked, that basil will grow if you talk to it and that the basil in Idaho needs more praise than the basil in Kabul because it has a pride problem. Alma smiled because she had just been handed a string back to a life she sometimes thought she had shut in a door.

Brett had gone to the community center again. He could say he had because he wanted to watch and not because he wanted to participate, but his body betrayed him. He danced with a woman whose earlobes had tiny diamonds and a scar that disappeared under her collar, a scar that made him think of suture and survival and of the way people carry the proof of being put back together like a secret. He moved his hands the way Mercy had taught him and he did not step on her. He took a cookie because ritual demands a cookie and then he put it in his pocket and he would throw it away later with a ceremony that made the trash can feel like absolution. He stood for a long time in front of the bulletin board before he left. He read the dates and tried to make a calendar out of them and the calendar refused. He was, he told himself, not the kind of man who took trophies. He was the kind of man who prevented slippage. He left the building feeling good at being wrong.

On Bannock the fridge spoke the note that made the hair on his arms stand up and his jars were lined like pronouns along the top. He took one down and set it on the counter and placed his hand over it, not like a lid, not like a threat. He thought if he could teach the air to hold still, he could teach his heart to beat at Boise speed and not at Mercy speed, which was the speed of a woman laughing in a kitchen and laying down a secret like a strand of hair across a book. He flexed his fingers and put them flat and whispered a blessing that the church had not taught him and that he had made up from scraps. He said careful, dutiful, adored, and the words were soft enough to keep the light bulbs from flickering.

Alma went to the river and waited. She did not tell anyone she was waiting because the waiting would change if it knew it was being watched. She stood under a light that buzzed and called moths and she stepped a little to the side so a man could imagine the light was for him if he needed it. The woman with the cane crossed under the bridge and a girl in a red hoodie came out of a door and said, Ma, and Alma could feel the sound of a breath mint breaking in someone else’s mouth. She did not know, not yet, what kept him from moving. She only knew that all night the river ran like a narrative and she refused to let it write the ending without her.

At three a.m., when even the bars with neon fish had allowed men to go home and be sober, she heard a sound like a jar lid shifting slightly on glass. It was inside her kitchen, because grief plays that kind of trick, and she went to stand in the doorway and look at the planters holding darkness like soil. She wrote one more sticky and put it on the mirror and this time it only had a number on it: the address of the house on Bannock where she did not yet know she would go. She told herself she would not knock. She told herself she would make a map that did not require an entry. She sat at the table with the empty dog bed at her feet and the napkin now gone to the evidence room and the city took a long, careful breath like someone had taught it a better way to breathe.Alma woke with the particular jolt the body gives when it thinks it has slept through something it promised not to miss. For a disoriented few seconds she thought she was back in a country that kept time by explosion and rumor; then the windchimes across the street told her where she was, and the smell of last night’s tea, strong as a scold, told her who. She sat up on the couch because she had not gone to bed, and she listened to the house find all its corners the way an old dog will circle and circle until it discovers the right hollow. The sticky notes on the mirror had held all night without curling. Mint. Remember. Mercy. She added one that said pace and stuck it lower, as if to make the apartment itself look down and measure.

By midmorning she had made two circuits of the neighborhood on foot and a call to the community center that she phrased cheerfully because cheerfulness is a key that opens doors politeness cannot. Poppy answered because Poppy always answered, even when she should have let the phone go to the kind of machine that has no pity. “I need to come by,” Alma said. “I’ll bring the good pens and a package of cups that aren’t slick on the outside. The old kind. The kind with a paper taste that means something to your hands.”

“You want the sign-in,” Poppy said, amused and not at all fooled by cups. “You want to know if we make people write their names like sinners. We do. We are the kind of sinners who like a list.”

“I want to look,” Alma said, and left the please implied because she and Poppy had a treaty: directness honored the other’s time, and both of them pretended that their time was not the last commodity they refused to spend unwisely.

At the center the wax on the floor still strained toward shine even at eleven when the light came through the high windows and made everything look like it had been rubbed with an eraser. Poppy had the ledger open and a cookie balanced on the ring binding as if sugar were an office supply. “People don’t print their last names,” she said, tapping a column full of loops and slanted letters. “They think the Lord will take offense if they finish.”

“I only need to know if anyone writes his with a hand that believes in rulers,” Alma said. “A steady boy is who I’m looking for.”

Poppy pushed the book toward her, and for a moment Alma was retaken by the sensation of being eight and having a spelling list slid under her palm: align, allege, alive. She ran her finger down the most recent week. Poppy had not lied; most names were a friendly mess, hearts dotting i’s, initials where nerves refused to be memoried on paper. There it was, in a square where Thursday thought it was Friday. Brett, the letters clipped short as if they were worried about trespass. Next to it, in a smaller hand, an A and a phone number that stopped after five digits as if its writer had been interrupted by relief.

“Brett,” she said, trying the shape quietly and immediately repenting the intimacy of speaking a stranger’s name like sunlight in a house. “We have a field.”

“We always have a field,” Edna said from the chair by the vending machine that never dispensed what its bright face promised. She had a newspaper folded into a spear. “You want a last name, you’re going to have to take up a collection. Or ask the boy who sits at the table with the bingo prize punch cards. He likes to know things more than he likes to keep them.”

The boy was forty if he was a day, with a face that kept deciding it would be younger if only it tried hard enough. He wore a cap with a fish that had far too much personality for a hat. “I write names when people get shy,” he announced before Alma had made it all the way to the table. “Shy is a disease here. We cure it with pens.”

“You wrote a Brett,” Alma said. She kept her voice so gentle that even her body was surprised by it. “Do you remember a last name.”

The boy looked toward the center of the room as if names grew there like geraniums. “Starts with an A,” he said. “Maybe it was Ames. Maybe it was Amos. Maybe I’m a witness who can’t be trusted and I should be taken off the stand.”

“Ames sounds like a person who knows how to keep a secret,” Edna said dryly. “Amos sounds like a man who knows scripture and nothing else.”

“Ames,” Alma repeated, knowing that even if it was wrong, the mouth liked to choose what it liked and the mind would follow to be polite. “You get a number?”

The boy looked insulted. He pointed at the half-finished phone with a despair so theatrical it circled toward sincere. “The man got rescued by a woman with hair like a pollen cloud,” he said. “She tugged him to the floor and he smiled like there was not a single thing in the world he shouldn’t do if asked.”

Poppy made the sound that happens when a person would like to be worldly and finds herself betrayed by hope anyway. “She did not rescue him,” she said. “We do that here, but not like that. She interrupted his tendency to float.”

Alma wrote Brett Ames and put the letters down as if they might tip if she got careless. She thanked the room like a congregation and left the box of paper cups and took her ledger copy, and by the time she was back in her car her phone was warm with a call from Eva she had not earned. “Progress,” Alma said before her daughter could list the ways she was worried and the one way she was thrilled.

“Tell me, but tell me like I am an ordinary friend and not a person you made in a kitchen with too much light,” Eva said. “Make it linear. We will pretend this is math.”

“Name,” Alma said. “Maybe a real one. Probably a real one, because people don’t lie if they’re being looked at by a woman who has arithmetic for a spine. The dance. He is polished. Mint. Careful shoes. Brett Ames.”

“I’ll run it,” Eva said, and Alma caught herself and then let herself be grateful for a child who took the world like an assignment and sometimes let it be a poem. Eva worked for the state in an office that believed in forms and also in coffee strong enough to fact-check. She was the kind of person who could run a name through a machine without the machine knowing it had been worked. “I’ll call you in an hour. If I don’t, get mad.”

“I’m not in the mood for anger,” Alma said. “It’s too early. I’m at my gentle setting.”

“Your gentle setting is most people’s fire alarm,” Eva said, with that affection that had been hardened and then softened again by adulthood. “One hour.”

In the hour Alma drove nowhere useful and all over at once. She let the car take her to the corner where the laundromat had burned and the plywood still made a kind of ashamed face. She drove past the jar aisle store because she wanted to see if she could track a man by the absence he left behind when he bought glass. She noted the days trash pick-up happened on Bannock because bags have a way of talking if you know to listen. She turned down a block that looked like it had been assembled from leftovers and new promises, and she let the car roll to a stop, and she waited without knowing what she was waiting for.

Brett had the radio on low because human voices in the air let him pretend he was not alone with the precise long instrument he had made of his life. He was sanding a bit of wood to wedge under the bad leg of the kitchen table, and every pass of the sandpaper gave him a coarse, persuasive sound that made his nerves agree to a treaty. The announcer on the station he trusted—because the station pretended it did not trust itself—was talking about city council budgets and the way a plan can be a way to apologize in advance. He turned the volume down further and addressed the table leg, which had offended him by not being as loyal as other legs. “We’ll make you even,” he said, and then he felt his face burn because he had done it again, he had spoken to a thing and not to a person. He fetched a mint like a man might fetch a small discipline and pressed it against his palate until it dissolved small.

The phone on the wall, an old plastic thing with a mouth like someone who wanted to ask a question and had changed his mind, did not ring. It rarely did. The only person who had ever called him with regularity was dead and buried and even Mercy, practical as bread, had not found a way to send long-distance love from Morris Hill. He stood in front of the jars and did not count them, because counting made him feel like a treasurer and he wanted to be a witness. He adjusted the rag under one so the sweat did not memory the paint into circles. He stood very straight and thought of the word blade and told himself he would not say it in his head again today.

He went out without his coat because the day had decided to be warm in the untrustworthy way Boise does when it wants to convince the front porches to believe again. He made it as far as the sidewalk and then went back, because the coat was an anchor and he needed to feel held to something. He walked toward the store where he had bought the jars with all the quiet he made when he was listening for permission to exist near people who did not know him and would not like the way he kept. Near the entrance a woman with elbows like a prayer bone was struggling with a sack of soil that weighed more than the chemo that had taken her husband in another part of the country takes the strength of a year. He lifted the bag without asking because asking is another way to say I might let you down. She said “oh” without shame and then “thank you” like a pebble she set on a fence post to mark a path. He placed the bag in her trunk and resisted the urge to straighten the bag that was already straight.

“You’re the mint man,” she said suddenly, and he had a heartbeat of wanting to laugh and a heartbeat of wanting to run.

“Excuse me,” he said, and there was no trick in it, only bafflement.

“My friend says you come to the dances,” the woman said. “She called you the mint man. It wasn’t unkind. She says it like a nickname. We all have them. I’m the one with the earrings that look like saucers. Poppy. If you know names.”

He nodded because he did, he remembered in the way you remember faces that had liked you without preamble. Saying Poppy in his head felt like thinking of a parade. “Brett,” he said, which was a way of telling himself the truth as well.

“Well, Brett,” Poppy said, and there was not a single threat in the way she said his name, only a neighborly inventory. “If you see Edna, tell her she owes me a rematch for insulting my shuffle.”

“I don’t know that I will see her,” he said, and his hands wanted his pockets and he kept them at his sides with the care you give a bird that might startle.

“You will,” Poppy said. “Everyone sees everyone eventually if they live here long enough. We are not a city so much as a loop.”

He stood a moment longer because the temptation to confess was growing hot and weird at the back of his throat. Bless me, he wanted to say, I have done a thing I think is holy and no one claps. But this was not church and she was not a priest and he did not have the courage to be forgiven. He lifted two fingers in something that was almost a salute and left.

Eva called as Alma parked half a block from a row of rentals that had the same paint color and the same optimism about grills under eaves. “Ames doesn’t throw much,” she said without being the least smug. “We have Ameses who own land in Meridian and an Ames who owes on a boat and an Ames who works for the state and is allergic to pine pollen. We have one Brett Ames who had a Boise address on Grove Street five years ago and nothing since. Car registered and old. Not illegal old, just stubborn. No gun. No hunting license. No homeschool blog. Which is to say he is an adult who has learned how to almost disappear the easy way.”

“Not married,” Alma said, not because that mattered to the file but because she had started thinking of the way a second toothbrush can sometimes save a life.

“No record of such,” Eva said. “He is a ghost with receipts. He paid the sewer bill every month for a year with money orders. Then he didn’t. Then he paid cash at a window for a while. Then there’s a gap. There’s always a gap. You’d think we’d learn to build bridges there instead of staring into it and feeling poetic.”

“I can work with him,” Alma said, and her voice had a feeling in it like the click of a safety going on, not off. “Thank you.”

“Mom,” Eva said, and the word held so much else—the girl who had watched convoys leave and been told they were going to be safe because that is what you tell; the woman who had watched her father’s body decline like a book that has been read in the rain; the person who had learned how her mother says love with logistics and was trying not to be offended by it. “Mom, I need you not to go into any house like it’s a tent you own.”

“I don’t own tents anymore,” Alma said gently, and for once she let her daughter have the last word because sometimes yielding is a tactic and sometimes it’s how you show you remember who raised you.

She got out of the car with nothing in her hands that would have made an officer lecture her and everything in her head that would have made a colonel nod. The house on Bannock she had written down had, like too many in that bracket, a hedge that apologized for itself and a small cracked step that had been mended with the kind of cement patch kit you buy late on a Sunday when the world is not looking. She walked past without slowing and counted the seconds it took for the refrigerator hum—the one that always seems to leak through walls in that frequency that says I am doing my job with dull heroism—to present itself. The hum was there, and under it an almost undetectable note that made her arms feel as if she had stepped close to an old fuse box. She let the block end and turned the corner and then turned again and came back. She looked up at the windows like paying respects. No movement; the person inside had practiced being still and had been graded well.

She did not go to the door. She did what you do when you have a name and a smell and an address and not enough proof to stand under the weight of the thing you want to say. She went to the alley because alleys are where cities tell the truth. The bins stood with their mouth-lids half-cocked, theatrical about their fatigue. She did not touch a thing, because she was not going to be a woman who invited a lecture she didn’t deserve. She stood and looked the way she had learned to look at roadsides for IEDs, for the one bit of ground that was the wrong color, the one rock that had been placed by a hand and not by weather. There on the ground behind the bin, where the truck’s arm never reached, lay a cardboard sleeve meant to hold jar lids. She recognized the brand because you don’t grow herbs for a decade without learning who thinks rings should cost more than they do. There was a strip of tape torn from a paper sack at the grocery; she could just make out the inked word mints and then two more letters, a y and an s, Shaw’s or Larry’s or Grady’s, one of those little Boise markets that believe in stocking everything except what you need on Tuesday.

When she left the alley she felt the way she had felt the night she realized the road ahead of them had not been walked by anything with legs in a long time, only by people with fear. She went to June’s niece with the intention of bringing soup and left on the counter a list of what to watch for that wasn’t obvious: men who stop by to carry a bag and leave before you can memorize a freckle, a car that parks with its nose out as if it were shy, the smell of mint where mint doesn’t belong. Hannah had looked at her like gratitude can bruise. Alma patted her shoulder, a gesture June would have criticized for its lack of delicacy, and she told herself they were choosing the best of bad options.

Detective Cobb texted that the napkin had yielded nothing except the truth that Boise has two brands of green ink most sandwich places prefer, and a smudge of sugar that could be the breath mint myth or the cookie tray. She wanted to reply that myth is just a pattern that hasn’t yet been given city money, but she did not. She drove to the senior center instead and stood in the doorway like a woman waiting for a son who had said he would come back by lunch. The music was a song older than the floor. Edna lifted her hand in a queenly flick and made a chair appear next to her. Poppy clicked her tongue. The boy with the fish hat nodded as if this were the court he ran and the case on the docket had finally gotten interesting. Alma watched the door and told her pulse to be modest.

It is a particular cruelty of the world that when you are waiting for the worst or best thing, the door opens for a hundred other versions first. A man with a velcro wallet that rrrrrripped every time he bought a fifty-cent coffee. A woman whose hair made its own weather. A couple who still asked strangers to take their picture the way tourists do, which is to say sincerely. At last Brett came in. The coat again, and the way his hands did not swing freely because they had been told to behave. Something about the room adjusted itself to accommodate him the way people shift on a bench when an old dog approaches. He saw Alma the way an animal knows the slight tension between one tree and the next. He nodded—a tiny, impermissible yes—and moved along the wall like a man who has learned to be scenery.

She did not go to him. She took in, instead, the small choreographies other people teach us. He greeted the far table with a lovely ridiculous half-bow he might have learned from the church or the movies. He refused a cookie and then took it and then did not eat it, and Poppy raised an eyebrow in triumph. He danced once, with Edna, and Alma watched the way his head tipped not in dominance but in deference, as if to say I understand you have your own gravity. It would have charmed her had she not been aligned with the missing. The song ended and the room applauded itself for surviving the slow. Brett let himself be applauded and then gave the room back its attention.

When he left Alma waited a measured count—one leaf falling, two, three—and then she followed. She did not try to be clever with it; Boise doesn’t ask you to be clever with your tail. It asks you to be patient. She let him cross a street and then another. He paused by a bus stop to make it believable that he might be waiting for something so municipal. He did not get on when the bus came; she liked him better for that because it meant he had not selected that particular camouflage. He turned where the city turns from its pretty center into the part that looks like it could be any other town if you squinted. He came to Bannock with the familiarness of a man whose keys lived in his hand. He did not look back. People who look back are either clumsy or villains, and he had not decided which he was willing to be seen as.

He went up the cracked step and he opened the door with his shoulder and his coat, and he was inside, and Alma stood in the shade of a tree that had been told by the city where to put its roots and had objected and gone her own way. She stayed until she thought staying looked like a plan, and then she left, feeling both too late and too early, which is the permanent state of everyone decent who tries to live among harm.

Brett stood in the kitchen with the taste of the room still on him and let the lid on the jar in his hand slide a fraction left and then right. He thought of the way Alma had stood in the doorway as if she were a threshold and not a person. He thought of Mercy lighting matches and then snuffing them just to waste nothing, the blackened sticks lined up like men who had chosen to stay. He sat down at the table that had finally stopped complaining because the shim had made its leg a promise. He put both hands flat and spoke to the air. “I am doing it right,” he said, because sometimes you had to be the one to award your own grade.

He had a plan he had not named aloud, and he tested its weight on his tongue. He would go to the bridge by the park on the night the volunteers with reflective vests took their walk to keep the college girls company; he would be a vest without a vest. He would walk behind the man who took too slow a breath and he would murmur a kind thing and the kind thing would become a direction. He would take a cab after so the plates wouldn’t remember him. He would buy laughter in exchange for asking for help with a bag to the trunk. He would tell himself and the jar and Mercy that this was not theft, it was reservoir work. He was adding to the city’s store of kept. He was affixing its loose pages. If he said it that way enough times, the word blade would not come and he would not have to punish it.

He cleaned the counter with a care that made the cloth perform, and he washed his hands as if cleanliness could bleach motive. He had never been a messy man. Mercy’s careful made him careful; her poor made him thrifty; her sudden leaving made him a registrar of what stays. He closed his eyes and saw the hallway of the community center, lit like a liturgy, and the way Alma had let her gaze pass over him and stop, not gawking and not denying. He saw that she would not be kept easily out of any room that had a door less stout than she was. He felt something like relief. He had been waiting for someone to watch, he told himself, the way you wait for an audience that thinks they’ve wandered into the wrong theater and then sits down anyway. You looked for that kind of person, because they made the world serious.

Cobb had done what good men without enough hours do: he had sent people who wore his badge to places that would be easy to explain on the news if the news asked, and he had held the rest in his head like a shape he could not show anyone. He sat in his car at the edge of the park and ate a sandwich his wife had made because she had started to bring him breakfast and lunch when she realized he was living out of vending machines and fast food confessionals. She texted him pictures of their toddler in a hat his mother had knitted, and he texted back pictures of the river that didn’t show the part where the water carries everything and asks no questions. He watched Alma walk the perimeter at a distance and did not call to her because he had learned that once you make someone part of a team, you inherit their ghosts and their guilt. He had enough. He told himself he wasn’t using her. He told himself he was letting his city be watched by someone it had already hired in a different life.

That evening a group of students trooped down to the Greenbelt in the kind of unison that suggests a class had made them do it. One girl wore a hat with cat ears; one boy had a shirt that named a band that did not deserve to be remembered this long. The man in the heavy coat appeared two benches back and then was simply part of the path, and no one would have noticed him except the person with a map for a mind and the detective with a ring he had stopped twisting by brute force. Alma took two steps toward the bridge and then made herself stop as if someone had put a hand flat to her shoulder and said wait. Brett slowed to let the old couple pass in front of him, and he raised his head as if receiving a benediction, and his hands did not tremble. The city lights clicked to their evening setting and went to amber, and the water translated the day’s stupidities into something like sense.

The woman with the cane from the bread shop came, but this time her daughter, the girl with the red hoodie and the voice that was meant for calling things home, was already with her. They stopped under the willow. The cane tapped an improvisation that had learned what rhythm could do. Brett was within ten paces without effort. Alma moved left because she had learned in convoy training that left is sometimes the lane where the road fails a little less. Cobb shifted his parked car forward six feet so the headlights brushed the benches without giving anyone a reason to be tense. The cat-eared girl laughed and frightened a goose into believing it had been insulted. Time did something it does only when a city is being watched by those who know how: it slowed to allow courage and then sped to lose track of harm.

Brett moved not toward the woman with the cane but toward the man who trailed two steps behind his wife and the dog that wanted to tell the trees a secret. He would have asked to lift a bag. He would have said a sentence he had polished for weeks, a sentence that made a person feel seen and then compliant. He might have said, “It’s hard at the curb, let me,” and the man might have said that miracle of a small word, “Oh,” and then “Thanks,” and a world would have turned on a hinge. But the dog, being the kind of citizen the city didn’t know how to credit, chose that moment to do a ridiculous thing. He darted toward a gullible-smelling patch of air, wrapped his leash around his owner’s knees, and made a knot out of love and optimism. The old man laughed, sharp and delighted with the stupid physics of a pet, and the old woman reached for her husband’s elbow and steadied him, and they stood a moment in the path like an altar you couldn’t pass without bowing. Brett stopped dead because the choreography he had rehearsed required an open lane and a kind of gratitude he could harvest; it did not know what to do with joy.

Alma felt it, the way you feel an electrical thing not meant for your body pass through it anyway. She moved again, not fast, because fast is threatening, but with the steady of someone who has carried a stretcher over a ditch. She was close enough now to see his eyes, and they were not empty—no comfort there—but full, too full, like someone had turned a faucet and walked away. She said alive words, banal words, because the everyday sometimes is the wire you can grab to not get charred.

“Good dog,” she said to the ridiculous animal. “Bad engineer.”

The old man laughed again and shook his wife’s arm as if to say see, we are part of a script that keeps itself going. Brett smiled in a way that hurt and put his hands where she could see them and then where anyone could. He looked at Alma as if to say you are a person who names the wrong things right in time. He took a step back that was almost a bow. He left without looking like he was leaving. Boise accepted his exit like it accepts a bent shopping cart wheel: noted, disregarded, not repaired.

Later that night Alma opened the cupboard where she kept the things she didn’t trust herself around when she was tired—sugar, whiskey, old letters—and took down the last. It was a letter Owen had written from a place he was ashamed to be, not because of the country but because of the desire he had found in himself to stay alive even if it meant being a stranger to the man who had volunteered to be brave. She read it the way she had always read it, slow and cruel, and then she put it back and told herself what she always told herself: the things you love are allowed to be complicated; that is how you keep them. She sat on the floor by the dog bed because being low made her body remember what it was built to do. She closed her eyes and let her map reorganize from a grid into a topography. She put a pin in Bannock. She put a pin in the bridge. She put one in the community center and one in the little shop near the Capitol and one in Morris Hill because she had a feeling about men who visit graves in daylight to convince themselves they are daylight men.

Brett lay on his back on the floor because the couch had too much memory and the bed had too much script. He looked up at the ceiling and watched a spider find its way from duct to duct and thought of roads. He put the mint in his mouth and did not bite it. He thought of Alma’s face near and not hostile. He thought of Mercy with flour on her cheek like a costly mistake and said her name without sound. He told himself he would be careful for one more night because Boise had played him a song he had not anticipated, the music small and loud: a dog making a knot out of love. He told himself you do not act against a knot like that when you plan to be a man who deserves to say the word keep and not have the world spit. He slept finally, not because peace came, but because exhaustion has no ethics.

The next day he woke before the sky had decided what color it was and he drove to the river and sat in his car and watched fog behave beautifully and lie about its intentions. He told himself that patience was part of the liturgy. He told himself that Alma would get bored and he would get brave and that the thing he meant to do would return to being something he could call mercy without flinching. He told himself this long enough that the words became a chant and the chant became a noise and the noise became another hum behind the fridge, and even a man as careful as Brett can stand only so much hum before he confuses the world’s instruments for his own.

Alma wrote a list she would leave on Cobb’s desk without a lecture attached to it because she understood how men like him take in paper. She wrote: Bannock. Jars. Mint. Brett Ames. Community center. Mercy. She added the word dog and then circled it as if to remind herself to buy something small for Joel up the block whose helmet had a crack she had promised to scold. She dressed not like a person who was going to war but like a person who had errands, which was the same thing in cities that have forgotten to budget for attention. She picked up the headlamp from the duffel and put it back. She looked at her face in the mirror with the notes stuck like a child’s spelling test around it, and she said aloud to the woman there, “Not brave. Careful. The world has enough brave. Be careful instead.”

Out on Bannock the trash had been collected and the bins tilted open-mouthed and emptied. The cardboard sleeve behind Brett’s bin had gone to the truck’s appetite and been crushed into anonymous pulp. The street looked like a place where it would be old-fashioned to be afraid. A man carried a ladder from a yard into a garage and whistled. A woman pushed a stroller that had been engineered with suspension envy. Joel rode his scooter and ignored the crack in his helmet and waved at Alma like he was certain she would catch it if he threw it. She returned the wave with two fingers because that had been the gesture she’d loved recently, the simplest recognition: I see you. I do.

Cobb stood beside his car with the trunk open and the toolbox he carried when he needed to look like he intended to fix something large. “Be kind to my paperwork,” he said when she handed him the list. “I have a talent for losing the things I need and finding them again only when I’ve stopped needing them.”

“I can write it on the back of your hand in pen,” she said, and he grinned because their humor had learned to meet in the middle of their ghosts.

“We’ll get a warrant for Bannock,” he said, not promising the thing itself would exist, only that the motion would be made. “You know I’m going to have to pretend I don’t know it because a woman walked down an alley and used her eyes.”

“I’m used to men pretending,” she said. “Do your paper. I will do my walking.”

He closed the trunk like a book with an argument he intended to win later. “He’s not going to stop,” he said, not for her benefit but because the city had ears and sometimes needed the sound of a man accepting the obvious. “The river’s not going to give them all back either. We can’t count on water to return what we are.”

“No,” she said. “But water repeats itself. We can use repetition. He needs it as much as the river does. He is telling himself a story he’s been memorizing for years. If we interrupt his cadence, he’ll trip.”

“You think you can make him laugh again,” Cobb said, remembering a detail she had not told him because he had heard it himself when he’d heard her say it born of the river’s stupid witness. “Or cry.”

“I think I can make the city inconvenient,” she said. “It’s not good at that. It wants to be helpful. We’re going to make it say no for once.”

Brett stood in the hardware aisle of the store that smelled like nails and aftershave and tugged a package of small latches off a hook. He said out loud to the metal and paper, “Not shelves,” and he put them back because the landlord had said not to make the walls reason with weight. He took instead two boxes of the heavy rubber bands you use to keep tarps from giving up, and he looked at the cash and decided to use a card because this, finally, was the small defiance he allowed himself. He signed the screen Brett A. because it would not take the rest and it made him feel at once infant and god. On his way out of the store he passed the rack of breath mints and could not tell if the universe were mocking him or participating. He bought none and then walked halfway to the door and turned back and bought two, as if being watched by his own better self.

At dusk the city turned to amber and then to the kind of dark that is too polite to call itself night. Alma walked the loop with a purpose that had learned how to slow for dogs and ducks. Cobb’s unmarked car appeared and then didn’t, like a magic trick you become bored with when you understand the mirror. People out on dates passed her and judged themselves good by the number of times they did not check their phones. The woman with the cane did not come because she was home learning that basil grows like a boast if you talk sweet to it. The bridge murmured, the train imagined itself brave, and the jars on Brett’s fridge made their faint seethe that no one hears except the keeper and the person who stands in the kitchen doorway and understands what an altar looks like when a man has given himself permission to pretend mercy is a noun you can hold.

When the thing broke, it did not break. It bent. It happened on a weeknight between storms. A man with a cap that said NAVY in letters so worn they looked tender paused under a lamp that flickered because the city hadn’t gotten to it yet. His gait had the wobble of a year spent learning to walk again after a fall that had treated him like a lesson. Brett slipped out of the shadow where the path kinks near the museum and walked as if he were meant to be beside the veteran; he didn’t speak immediately because he knew how to let someone choose a lane of conversation. Alma took three steps and then five and then she didn’t step at all because in that moment she saw the man turn his head toward Brett and saw recognition there, not because they knew each other but because old men have lived through every kind of kindness and every kind of theft and they can tell which is which by the way a stranger breathes.

“Son,” the veteran said, and it came out both blessing and warning.

Brett nodded, and that was the danger, the agreement implicit. He put his hand out to the bag the veteran carried, light, so light, the weight of a sandwich and a small bottle of milk. He took one strap and the veteran kept the other, and for a few yards they walked like that, brigaded, and Alma felt the hair on her arms lift because a city that has been held like that doesn’t let go without leaving marks.

“Hard to see at the curb,” Brett said, the line he had written on the inside of his head so many times it had become an artery.

“Been seeing curbs longer than you’ve been seeing haircuts,” the veteran said, and even Brett had to laugh because he had been resisted with style. They reached the parking lot, and the veteran stopped at a truck that had learned to be faithful. He took his bag back without tugging. He set it on the seat with a care that made Alma ache for everything that had ever been placed gently in this world. He turned to Brett and put his hand to the younger man’s wrist, not a grip, not even pressure, just the old man way of measuring a pulse without counting.

“Whatever you think you’re doing, do it in the daylight,” he said. “Men who do their careful in the dark get lost.”

Brett leaned in, not threatening, but hungry for instruction the way a kid is hungry for the part of school that has nothing to do with tests. “It has to be night,” he said, so soft Alma only caught the shadow of it.

“Nothing has to be night,” the veteran said, and he got into his truck and turned the key and the engine made the noise of a thing that has decided to cooperate, and he drove away as if he had finished a kind of work men once got medals for.

Brett stood alone in a block of light, and the mint in his mouth shattered, and he tilted his head back and closed his eyes and smiled with his teeth and then without. Alma could have gone to him then. She could have stood under the light and said a name. She could have said the word remember and placed her palm flat on the idea between them until it warmed. She did not. She let the moment pass because she had survived long enough to know that abandoning glory is another kind of discipline. She made a note on her map in the space in her head where names go when you’re not ready to use them. Then she went home and watered the basil until the soil darkened enough to look like it had made a decision.The morning after the veteran’s benediction, the city did that thing it does in late winter where it pretends to be a place you can trust. The light came in steady, the sky held itself like a dish that wouldn’t spill, and even the trash trucks seemed to hum in a key that didn’t offend. Alma watched from her porch and allowed herself the luxury of believing the day would obey. She had a list in her pocket—names, places, a grocery item she had no intention of buying but wrote down because her body needed a decoy—and she had a plan that would move only if other people agreed to be the kind of stubborn Boise raises. She sent three texts before seven, and each came back with the affirmative she needed: Edna at the senior center, Poppy with her earrings and her will, and Joel’s mother, who had rolled her eyes at the helmet lecture and then bought a new helmet anyway because neighbors are a kind of law.

By midmorning the center looked less like a place where a dance could redeem an afternoon and more like a small headquarters that had finally admitted it was one. Poppy had commandeered a table with a plastic tablecloth patterned with apples so bright they looked like they might blink. She had a sign-up sheet with columns for names, phone numbers, walking routes, and notes that read like poetry if you squinted: “Benches have bad knees,” “North bridge rattles like a can of screws,” “Mrs. Ortega stops for geese; send someone with a broom.” Edna refused a clipboard because clipboards offended her, but she accepted a stack of index cards that she could tuck into her cardigan sleeve as if they were love letters she hadn’t decided whether to answer. Alma stood behind them and let her presence be the backstop; people are braver when they know someone has their backs and will not let the air sneak up behind them.

They called it a buddy system because the words were easy to swallow, but what they meant was surveillance with tenderness. No one walked alone who didn’t want to be alone, and even those who insisted they were fine were shadowed by people whose skill set was to appear to admire ducks while counting beats between breaths. Poppy, who made everything a little more elegant than it had to be, produced lanyards with tags that said WALKER and WATCHER in a font that would not scare a child. Alma wanted to reject the tags on principle—if a wolf reads, you do not label the sheep—but she swallowed the instinct and agreed because some days the world needs to see itself making an effort, even if the effort is mostly theater. She took a route herself because sending others out without setting her own feet on the same path felt like a sermon without a confession.

Detective Cobb appeared at the edge of it all, a jacket over a shirt that had been ironed in a hurry and an expression that said he was catching up in real time. He stood with Poppy the way men stand with women who are not impressed by badges and had learned long ago when it is smarter to be polite than authoritative. “I need your routes,” he said, and Poppy handed him a copy like a queen patronizing the appropriate function of bureaucracy. “We have uniforms at the bridges and an unmarked near the museum,” he added, and he didn’t say he knew it looked like acting; he didn’t have to. Alma watched him tuck the papers into a file that would make their effort exist officially and she felt a tiny flake of cynicism lift from her shoulders; sometimes it really did matter to put a thing on paper and let it be accounted for.

The first loop was uneventful because life often behaves impeccably under a new rule just to build a case against it later. Alma walked with Mrs. Ortega, who had indeed stopped for geese and had announced to them with priestly gravity that bread was not a righteous diet. They crossed under the bridge where the sound changed from river to studio, and Alma kept an easy cadence that allowed for gossip without breathlessness. Across the path, a man in a jacket too heavy for the day stood with his hands empty, and his emptiness had an intention to it. She angled them toward the open and kept Mrs. Ortega between herself and the water because being afraid of a river is not the same as being rude to it, and she would not give the Boise the satisfaction of thinking it had become an accomplice.

Brett watched the lanyards appear like a small migration he had not predicted. The tags read WALKER and WATCHER and made his mouth go dry the way a judge does when he pronounces a sentence that will not be served. He adjusted his route and then refused to adjust because to adjust would be to admit the day had rights over him he had not delegated. He stood in the wedge of shadow near the willow and practiced the art he had told himself counted as discipline: he waited. The word the veteran had placed in his body sat like a stone in a stream; the water around it made its own voice and he could not decide whether to learn its rhythm or drown it with his own. He had not gone to the bridge with any intention he would say aloud, but his hands had carried the shape of a thing they wanted to do, and now that the room had changed—there was always a room, even under the sky—he had to change, too, if he wanted to keep calling himself careful.

At home that afternoon he took down every jar and wiped the dust rings their bottoms had made on the top of the refrigerator. He folded the rags beneath them with a precision that apologized for the smell he knew lived in this room even if visitors never came and did not witness it. He told the jars, without moving his lips so that he could pretend he wasn’t addressing glass, that interruption is not the same as ending. He told himself the same and believed it halfway. The kitchen table, newly shored by his wedge of sanded wood, behaved impeccably under the cloth, and he smoothed his palms over it the way Mercy used to smooth a sheet and make domestic bravery look routine. He stood very still and listened to the hum of the fridge and tried to convince himself that the city and the machine were not singing to each other about him.

Eva called her mother from a narrow hallway lined with corkboards pinned with notices that, if read together, made a poem about bureaucracy and hope. “The judge likes paper,” she said without hello, because proximity gives you the right to dispense with ceremony. “Cobb’s request will get looked at today. He made it not about jars or mint or rivers. He made it about a tenant in violation and a smell a neighbor complained about, which is to say he told the court a story it could live with, and we’ll get the warrant by dinnertime if everyone behaves.”

“Everyone never behaves,” Alma said, but she allowed the smile into her voice because it would do Eva good to hear it. “How’s your boss who thinks bullet points are empathy.”

“Teaching a seminar on courage,” Eva said dryly. “I sent him your list. He wagged his head like a dog who does not understand fetch.”

“Good,” Alma said. “It’s a talent to be confusing to men who mistake a chart for a plan.”

They hung up with the ease of people who had spent years learning each other’s distances, and Alma used the hour until the judge’s decision like a miser spends coins: she allotted it to what would matter if the day ran ahead of her. She stopped by Hannah’s house and made herself learn the particular way June’s niece made grief into order—notes on the fridge, a schedule posted like law, a vase of flowers that needed water and that she watered because watering flowers is a kind of sacrament if you grew up believing plants will forgive you for being human. She called the veteran whose path had crossed Brett’s and left him a message with the exact amount of softness he would tolerate; she told him she admired the way he had let his lesson have a pulse. She checked in with Poppy and Edna and forbade them from inventing daredevilry to prove they were useful; Edna laughed at the prohibition and promised to behave like a woman with nothing to prove and then went off to prove it in her own fashion.

Cobb texted at three-thirty: Warrant granted. Alma sat down hard on the top step because sometimes relief feels like the removal of weight and sometimes it feels like a sudden addition. She texted back that she would be there and then made herself stand up slowly so her body would not betray a celebratory wobble in front of the shrubs. She drove to the station and allowed the fluorescent lights to judge her, because government buildings are built to judge and you might as well get it over with. Cobb handed her a copy of a paper with so much authority embedded in its verbs that she felt her own spine straighten even as she scowled at the idea of needing permission to interrupt harm.

They did not drive sirens-up because the world had not asked for theater and because Brett had taught his body what to do when everyone else was watching. Cobb took an unmarked; Alma followed in her own, not because she was stubborn but because familiarity is a tool and she knew every oil spot on Bannock the way soldiers know every noise in a night only they will remember. When they parked, the block offered them its indifference, which meant they were right on time. A garbage can with a cracked lid leaned in confederacy against a fence; a dog decided a cloud required a commentary; a teenager carried a skateboard under his arm like contraband in a country that had outgrown prohibitions. Cobb lifted his chin, the yes that meant now, and two uniformed officers peeled off the corner and took the sidewalk at a pace that neither apologized nor bragged.

Brett was at the sink when the knock came, and the knock was measured in a way that told a man what kind of day it would be. He turned the water off and left his hands wet because that, in this second, was proof of something ordinary. He wiped them on a towel that had never been as white as he had intended it to be and went to the door with the careful gait of a person who refuses to be startled even when the world steals the element of choice. He opened it, and the officers on the porch did not make the mistake of crowding him; they stood as if on a stage and were letting him decide whether he was in the audience or the cast. Cobb was two steps back, and Alma was a dark note in the near distance, and he felt the city tilt a fraction, not quite enough to spill what was on his counters, but enough that his breath recalibrated.

“Mr. Ames,” Cobb said, and it sounded like a name that would always be a last name, even if it were the only one the world would give him. “We have a warrant to search the premises.”

Brett nodded as if someone had told him rain was coming and he had always suspected the sky was only a kind of excuse. “Of course,” he said, and he stood far back to make a physical fact of his lack of obstruction. His hand twitched toward his pocket and he stopped it; the mint could wait, hunger would not be the thing he let them see.

It is one thing to imagine a door opening and quite another to watch your private grammar become a public read. The officers moved through the front room like kindness trying on a uniform; they did not touch what they did not have to, and when they did, they did it with the neutrality of people who had learned that meaning gets into your hands if you let it. Cobb crossed into the kitchen and paused because pauses matter; they tell the room you see it and you do not need to swing swords to own it. He looked up at the refrigerator and the row of jars that sat with their mended dignity, and he made no face that a child would remember later with nightmare clarity. He gestured slightly, and an officer stepped forward with a camera that looked falsely cheerful and documented the arrangement as if it were a set of wedding pastries.

Alma did not cross the threshold; she stood where the light from the kitchen could make it to the doorway and let her eyes carry her the rest of the way. She saw the jars the way people see gravestones, reading names that are not written, making of dates and dashes a story you can live with. She saw the rags beneath them, the thoughtfulness of the man who did not want to let the sweating lids bleed into the paint, the way your heart bleeds into your home and leaves marks if no one corrects for it. She catalogued what was not there—the absence of photographs, the absence of a second mug, the absence of the kind of clutter that forgives a life its compulsions—and she made a note she did not write down because writing it would make it cheap: he had built a church and called it kitchen so that he could preach to himself without interruption.

Cobb took a step toward the fridge and stopped at the sound the room made when you are about to ask it to surrender. He looked at Brett and gave him a chance to be a citizen in his own house, which is a courtesy you extend even when you do not expect it to be repaid. “I am going to take these down,” he said, and Brett nodded again, because what else can a body do once it has been named and measured. The first jar, once lifted, made the sound glass makes when it is pulled off paint that has decided to be loyal, a soft tack and release, and for a splintered second Alma saw something pass across Brett’s face that she could have called grief if grief did not feel like too large a word to spend on a moment so domestic.

They opened nothing without gloves and bags and witnessed formalities that keep everything from turning into story too early. The lids had been sealed in a way that would make a man proud who believed in sealant and not in anything softer. When the first ring spun free and the lid was eased—slowly, carefully, because this was a violence of a kind and it deserved not to be performed like theater—the smell that lifted was not simple. It had the sweet-sour of preservation and the church-like note of something too long kept from air, and even the officers, who had learned not to take scent personally, had to reassign something in their stomachs. Cobb looked, and then looked away, and then looked again because he had to. What lay inside was not gore—not a word Alma was willing to use even in her own head—but the truth of a body reduced to the part Brett had told himself told the story best. He had been right; feet tell their histories without needing translation.

Brett turned his face away like a man receiving a shot, brave in the old-fashioned meaning of the word—willing to stay, willing to be pierced. He did not speak. He did not excuse. He did not confess. He put his hands on the back of a chair he had mended and waited for the world to discover whether it intended to be merciful or merely procedural. Alma kept her eyes on him because the jars did not need her attention and he did. He had built a theology; she watched the moment the doctrine cracked and was replaced by something like air. Mercies are complicated; she let herself think of Mercy as a person and not a concept and felt the wrongness of the name attached to this act and made herself stay in the room with the wrongness anyway.

The inventory moved steadily because paper demands it, because courtrooms will be hungry later and must be fed words in the correct order. Cobb did what he had to, and he did it with a competence that would never make a headline. The officer with the camera catalogued with a gaze that had learned to be witness without becoming an accomplice. Someone opened a window because the room had begun to feel like it had been held too tightly by a hand with a tremor. Outside, Joel’s scooter scratched along the sidewalk, and then stopped as a mother’s hand did its small good work and steered him home. The ordinary intruded, and Alma blessed it.

When it came time to ask the questions, Cobb did not bring out a tape recorder. He knew the day had already been recorded in ways that mattered, and he suspected that the words Brett might form would not be the ones a judge would recognize as currency. He asked anyway, because men like him are hired to ask and because sometimes a question is the rope a person chooses to hold in their own flood. “Mr. Ames,” he said, and his voice was the same one he used when he asked his son to come down from the table. “Help me understand the keeping.”

For a beat Brett’s mouth did nothing. Then he lifted his hand like he was asking to be called on, like school was a thing he had been good at once and might be again. “You can see it,” he said, and he was not pleading; he was explaining to a man he had decided might be educable. “You can see where they went. You can see where they were. The rest disappears. The rest slips. Mercy told me the only love you can keep is the kind you can touch. The world won’t let you touch a heart and leave it there. The world thinks that’s obscene. But feet,” he said, and his breath made the word fog against the window light, “feet are permissible. They are practical. They are what carried the love. I did not take faces,” he said, in a tone that made Alma’s stomach make a fist. “I did not take faces.”

Cobb did not look at the jars again. He looked at the man whose theology had worn a groove into his life until it was a rut. “You took people,” he said, and he did not add the word son, because the veteran had used it and it had done its work and he did not want to cheapen a sacrament by making it a chorus. “You took them from the rest of their bodies and the rest of their people. You took them from their own feet.”

Brett’s eyes flicked, as if he’d been struck by a grammar he hadn’t considered. “I returned the rest,” he said, and even as he spoke, the sentence broke under its weight. “I returned them to where they were going to go. The river carries. It makes you think it isn’t him. It makes you think—” He stopped and put both hands to the back of the chair again like a person who needs to feel what wood can do. “I didn’t drown anyone,” he said, and it was true and not the point, both. “They were tired. They were ready to be kept from slipping. I only… I only kept what could be kept.”

Alma had stood silently long enough that her body wanted to protest, and she quieted it with the discipline she had learned from years of being told to wait until the shot starts. “You decided for them,” she said, and she did not raise her voice because rage has a way of becoming an invitation to bluster. “You told yourself you understood what tired looks like and you made tired the same thing as done. You told yourself that love can be kept without permission, and that is a theft I cannot let the city applaud.”

He turned his head toward her then, fully, and she saw the boy in him—the one who had pressed a finger to a candle to test his mother’s theology and cried in a quiet place because he could not bear both truth and secret at once. “You say Mercy like a name,” he said. “Not like a word.”

“I know enough to know the difference,” she said. “The word has teeth. The person did not.”

The night stretched its hands along the windowsills while the officers did the final bits of their profession, and when it was time to go, they went without triumph because there are days you do not get to feel like a hero. They walked Brett down the cracked step like they were escorting a man who had done something noble in another era and had been forced by the century to wear it like a crime. Neighbors peered and pretended they were not peering and were decent enough not to raise their phones. Joel looked from his porch and gripped his new helmet and then lifted it in a small salute that neither Cobb nor Alma nor Brett could properly receive. The world has its own litanies; you learn to let them pass.

At the station the paperwork began, which is to say the work whose paper is a witness that must be fed. Cobb took statements and let the room be the room it was—bad lighting, tired chairs, coffee that had been taught brutality. He knew the hardest thing would not be to prove what they would have to prove; it would be to find the right word to place on what had been done and where to put it so that men who live by budgets could understand what to do next. He wrote the words he could without choking. He left spaces where he could not yet.

Alma went home because there is a point at which staying does not make you more loyal, merely tired. She walked her small house as if it had been rearranged while she was gone and it had not. The sticky notes were still at the mirror, and she took down the one that said Mercy and held it between her fingers until the oil of her hand made the paper soften. She stuck it back up anyway because names deserve their place regardless of what other words have borrowed them for harm. She sat on the floor by the dog bed and listed in her head the people who would have to be told, and she rehearsed the sentences that did not let the city off the hook or make it the villain. She poured tea and let it go cold and drank it anyway because that is what you do to punish yourself for living where other people have been lost.

Hannah came to her door as the hour got indecent, not dressed for visiting, hair in a knot that made her look both younger and older. Alma opened before the knock finished, as if her bones had been the ones to announce the visitor. They stood looking at each other the way women stand who have been fending off other people’s ideas of comfort for too long. “We found a thing,” Alma said, and she did not say what thing because detail is not kindness, not ever, not unless the person asks and is firm enough to hold the answer once it has entered. “Cobb will come in the morning to make it official. Tonight all I can give you is the truth that someone’s jar is broken and the rest of the city will have to look at what spills.”

Hannah put both hands to her face like she was practicing being the statue of a saint she did not believe in, and then she dropped them and shook her head and laughed that small laugh grief takes out when it cannot bear being proper anymore. “June would have said feet,” she said, and Alma closed her eyes because the kindness of saying the word so simply would live in her for years. “She would have said of course it was feet. She spent her whole life getting children to stand up.”

In his cell Brett lay on his back and watched the square of light at the top of the wall record the passage of a hallway shadow. The mint had been taken from his pocket, and he reached his tongue against the roof of his mouth to feel if the taste might have been stored there as a reserve. He thought of Mercy’s grave and the way the wind carves lines along stones as if it had a stylus and an opinion. He thought of the veteran’s hand at his wrist and the dog making a knot out of love and the word remember on a napkin that had been taken from him and placed in a file like evidence of a spell. He put his hands flat on the thin blanket and said the words he had taught himself to say when the kitchen was a church and the jars were his choir. He said careful, dutiful, adored, and he knew, for the first time, that he would have to learn to mean them in a room where there was nothing to arrange.

The river made its ambers into night and then into the kind of dark that hums. Somewhere a woman whose name had been put on a whiteboard without consent was no longer a mystery and had returned to being a person you could talk about without lowering your voice. Somewhere a man who had fed sparrows at a park bench sat in a chair that had never stopped keeping him and put his slipper down the way he had always put it and did not yet know that the city had bent its head and admitted something about itself. Alma slept in increments and dreamed she was walking a road that moved with her and would not allow her to get ahead of it or behind it, and when she woke she said to the room the thing she had been saving for when exhaustion had made her honest: we keep each other or we fail, and there is no beautiful in failing. The fridge in her kitchen hummed a note that did not offend, and she got up to boil water she would not forget this time because remembering had become a muscle she could trust.By morning the city had arranged itself into a posture that suggested competence, the way a person will square their shoulders before stepping into a room they dread. The bridges wore their day colors and traffic observed the dance of merge and yield with a civility that felt rehearsed. Alma stood at the sink and let the kettle go just past the first cry before she turned the flame down and moved it, a small mercy for the metal she had anthropomorphized without shame. She had slept in pieces and each piece had offered a different script; in one she had been marching a squad through a valley where the rocks were lettered like tombs, in another she had been standing in June’s kitchen, rearranging mugs as if order could be persuasive to grief. She poured the tea and didn’t sweeten it and smiled because Owen would have accused her of theft—why steal pleasure from a morning that would not call the police if you did. On the porch the planters sat patient, basil seedlings so tiny they looked like punctuation at the end of a sentence that hadn’t been written. She raised the mug to the street because that had become a law of hers; the street, dutiful, did the same and offered up the simple business of people going about.

By nine-thirty her phone had reminded her of everything she already knew: the press had learned the words feet and jars and had married them in headlines that made her jaw ache; the city’s social media had posted a photograph of lights along the Greenbelt with the caption We walk together tonight, and comments had bloomed beneath it like a field that didn’t care about rain. Eva texted a string of square, practical sentences that made a bridge between daughter and investigator; the bridge was sturdy today. Cobb called without preamble and asked if she could stand at a microphone later and say words that would be the right kind of true, and she told him she would if he would let her write them herself. He agreed and added, gently, that he had already guessed as much. She put the phone on the table face down because screens are greedy for eyes and she wanted to see her house as it was—shadows where they were meant to be, dust confessing its presence along the bookshelf where Owen’s paperbacks, self-conscious and dog-eared, made a congregation of men who’d been to sea without leaving their chairs.

The center had more people in it than the idea of dance could account for; word had spread that this was where the city had learned to organize itself without permission. Poppy had produced a plastic crate filled with pens that did not betray their owners by failing, and Edna, queenly in a cardigan the color of old sky, sat at a card table and pretended to be a bureaucrat. Alma took the seat no one wanted—the one near the door, the one that makes you both greeter and sentinel—and watched the stream of faces, old and not, all of them carrying a private version of the headline that had made their stomachs lurch. A woman with eyes that had done too much reading handed Alma a bag of mandarins like it was ammunition. A man with the posture of a retired mail carrier announced to anyone who would listen that he would be the one to walk the path under the museum because he knew the temper of that particular stretch of earth. Alma wrote names, routes, preferences, and quiet fears on a clipboard that forgave her for not liking it. She kept glancing toward the hallway as if June might, by sheer contrariness, come back through it, carrying a granola bar and a lecture about the misuse of the word elderly.

When Cobb appeared he wore the kind of tired that did not ask for sympathy. He stood at the end of the table and transferred his weight the way men do when they have been on their feet longer than they promised the night before. He gave news in an order that respected the ear: the coroner had begun the work that would make names out of remains, the judge had signed papers that would allow more searching without incurring a lecture later about civil liberties, the department would be visible and also not, and the difference would be intentional. He did not use the word closure because he had learned that it was a lie people tell themselves about doors that were never theirs to close. When he finished, Edna said, “And the dance,” as if she were asking whether a holiday had been canceled, and he startled and then smiled and told her to do it anyway. The room let go a small breath none of them had wanted to be caught exhaling.

At noon Alma stood on a low riser outside the municipal building because a crowd wanted a shape, and words are a way to trace one without making a cage. The microphones were a line of metal mouths hungry for their sacrament, and the faces beyond them were too various for any single sentence to reward. She did not talk about jars. She did not talk about feet. She said the city’s name like a rank, and she said the names of the missing she had permission to say, and she asked the crowd not to forget them after the lights went back to ordinary. She drew the word keep out like a ribbon and passed it around to a dozen smaller words—escort, walk, call, notice, accompany—until it stopped meaning possession and started meaning companionship. She spoke June’s fondness for precise language into the air and hoped some journalist would take the bait and write elder where they would otherwise write old. When she finished, a man in a hat with a union logo nodded like he would show up tomorrow with a ratchet and ask the city which bolts needed tightening, and that was all the applause she wanted.

Hannah did not come to the steps. Alma had suspected she would not; public grief is an art form people often refuse. She went to Hannah’s house after the noise had thinned and found her at the kitchen table with a notebook and half a pack of sticky flags in three colors. The whiteboard still said JUNE in a hand that was playful even when it made lists. They did not talk about legal things; the detective would bring that packet later with its assurances embedded in the grammar. They talked about soup and whether it mattered that you use thyme and not oregano, and about granola bars that left no crumbs and thus did not absolve pigeons. Hannah said she had woken in the night and reached for her phone because it had become the oracle that dispensed punishment and reprieve, and then had put it under the couch cushion because her hand would not be trusted. Alma sat and let five minutes pass without words because silence, if given instructions, can do as much as sentences.

Across town Brett was learning a new taxonomy for rooms. The cell had dimensions that had nothing to do with tape measures; it expanded when he lay on the bunk and counted the screws in the ceiling and contracted when the guard’s shoes scraped a particular way on the wax before the door. He was aware of every threshold and what it asked of him. The interview room was simply a kitchen with the table nailed and the conversation dictated; he made himself notice the way light makes honesty harder or easier, and he practiced telling the truth in ways that did not betray what he had believed for so long. The public defender assigned to him was younger than he had guessed but older than the profession could admit, with a patience that felt practiced on children and drunks and despair’s aftershocks. The man had soft hands that were not gentle. He said words like desecration and tampering in a tone that left the room’s oxygen where it was, and he did not flinch when Brett said Mercy as if he were translating for a foreign court.

He found he was offended by the word dismember the way a good student is offended by a teacher’s mistake. The syllables broke wrong in his mouth; he wanted to lift the dis and set it somewhere it could not bully the rest. Remember belonged to his mother and to the kitchen and to the night he had folded paper into boats and sent them down a rain gutter that had pretended to be a river. He said this to the public defender, who wrote nothing down and who asked, instead, whether Brett would like to speak to the chaplain. That word made his chest hurt in a particular place. He had liked church when it was a room with candles and pictures of ladders that made no mathematical sense; he had hated it when it stopped allowing people to stand quietly in the back and be counted without being addressed. He asked for the chaplain anyway and then practiced saying careful, dutiful, adored in a voice so low it did not disturb the dust.

Cobb left his report on the chief’s desk and felt the familiar resentment and relief of paper passing out of his hands and into a system that would grind it smaller until it could be swallowed. He drove home with the radio off because the city had a noise in it today that he wanted to listen to—residents walking a little more in pairs, a certain silence around the river that was not respect so much as uncertain awe. His toddler was sleeping when he stepped into the house, which meant his wife had achieved the miracle of convincing chaos to nap, and he stood for a minute with his hand on the doorframe and let home make its argument. He would tell his wife later about nothing and everything; he would say someone he worked with had reminded him that words matter and that the ones for what had happened last night would not be the ones they thought. He would put his ring on the dresser and then pick it up again because feeling its weight on his finger would make him remember to be the kind of man who lets rooms be smaller around him so other people can breathe.

At dusk the vigil was not called a vigil because the people who gathered hated the way television had made that word look like a product. They called it a walk, and then they called it food, and then they called it what it was: we came out to be measured by one another’s gaze. Alma stood by the museum and watched as pairs of elders took their places with an economy she admired; if the city had run any other service this well, it would have given itself a proclamation. Shoes lined the edge of the path, not as a display but because people took them off to rest and then stood barefoot in the cold a minute to see what courage felt like. Someone had put a line of paper bags along the rail and set tea lights in each, and a breeze turned the flames into small tongues that might have spoken if asked something ordinary. Poppy came to stand at Alma’s side with the air of a woman begrudgingly pleased to be part of a parade she had not curated. Edna gave a running commentary on the dog population while pretending not to be moved by the sight of three teenagers walking arm in arm with a man whose cane thunked a steady bass line.

Hannah did come, but late, and she did not take a place in the center. She stood under the willow with her hands in her coat and her head lifted like a person who refuses to sob because it would be vulgar and also because she knows sobbing takes the same muscles as laughter, and she wasn’t ready to confuse them. Alma walked to her and didn’t speak for a time long enough to feel like an insult if measured by the rules of polite company. When she did, she told a story about June that was more embarrassing than admirable, about the time she had sworn at a loaf of bread in class because it had refused to develop a proper crust. Hannah laughed in a way that tried hard not to get the attention of the geese. Around them the paper bags winked and guttersnipes of flame whispered along the wax. Alma watched a boy in a cracked helmet dash up and down a stripe of pavement he had decided belonged to him and felt the kind of hope that is so small it barely registers and thus is trustworthy.

Brett met the chaplain on a morning when the hallway smelled faintly of disinfectant and caffeine and men who haven’t learned where to lay their anger at night. The chaplain had the beard men grow when they think it will give their comfort weight, and his eyes did not promise anything beyond the conversation. He did not say God loves you as if love were a label that could be stuck to any surface and be expected to adhere. He asked what Mercy had cooked when there was nothing in the house, and Brett surprised himself by answering, a flood of detail about beans and rice and the way she taught spice to behave, about the pace at which she stirred and how the sound of a wooden spoon against the side of a pot could make a boy feel witnessed. The chaplain asked whether Brett had ever kept anything that did not belong to him and regretted it, and Brett told him about the fireflies, and then stopped because the memory’s sweetness and shame were arguing. The chaplain did not ask why the jars had to be glass and not anything else; he asked instead who had taught Brett to read faces, and Brett said no one had, which was the truth and also a way to avoid saying that Mercy’s face had always been an easy book and that he had been ruined by the ease.

In the days that followed, Boise made a show of improvement that would have insulted them if it hadn’t also worked. Bushes along the path were trimmed, not in the brutal service of visibility alone but in a way that suggested a gardener had been consulted. New lights appeared where moths already were, placed at heights that made the path less a runway and more a domestic street. Small signs showed up at the entrances to the Greenbelt, not with the tone of a scold but with the voice of a neighbor: Walk with a friend. Call us if the path feels different. Sit when you need to. Tell the dogs hello. It would be easy to scoff, and Alma almost did, her internal sergeant ready with six sarcastic remarks, but then an old man read the sign aloud to his grandson and the boy read it back syllable by syllable, and she held her tongue because literacy is a sacrament and she would not cheapen anyone’s communion.

Eva came to dinner because she wanted to be fed in a kitchen that knew how to let women be angular without apology. She brought with her a thin folder of what she could tell and a grocery bag with too many vegetables because this was how she confessed worry. They chopped side by side and did not move out of each other’s way more than was strictly necessary, and Alma allowed herself to be clumsy twice because it relaxed Eva to be the more competent one once in a while. They talked about the way bureaucracies think they are immune to grief and then discover that grief is the one virus paperwork cannot vaccinate against. Alma told Eva she had used the word keep on purpose and watched it twitch on faces, and Eva said maybe they might claim it for a while, torch and pitchfork the thieves out of the word and make it liveable again. After they ate, they stood in front of the mirror with the notes and Eva struck through mint with the tip of her finger and wrote pace under it with the pad of her thumb like a child drawing letters in fog, and Alma laughed because children teach you not to ask permission from mirrors.

The funeral they held for June was no one’s idea of perfect, which is to say it was perfect. The sanctuary at the little church she’d attended only for bake sales and weddings was full of people who apologized for taking up air and then took up air anyway when they stood to speak. Hannah read a line from a poem June had loved and then made a face at herself like she wished she had picked a funnier one, and everyone laughed because June had been the kind of woman who could audit your grief and make you adjust the receipts. Alma told the story of the baguette again because some stories are not diminished by repetition and because standing up bread is harder than the world lets on. The pastor said words that meant well and did not harm; the harm had already been done and needed no chorus. Afterward in the hall, people ate food in the certified order of casseroles, and a girl from June’s neighborhood passed around note cards and asked people to write something that begun with “Remember when,” and Alma wrote, without bracing, Remember when you made that stew and admitted it tasted like the damp end of winter.

On an afternoon without rain, Cobb parked near Morris Hill with no plan more formal than standing. He had read the name Mercy Ames in a file compiled by a young officer who had the soul of a librarian and an elderly grandmother who taught her to make connections. He walked the rows without counting, letting the ground tell him where to stop, and then there it was, modest and stubborn, the dates short enough to make a man want to scold the world. He did not pray. He put his hands on his hips and looked generously at the stone, as if shaking his head kindly at an old friend who had committed some small domestic sin. He told her, because he had learned that sometimes it is useful to speak as if the dead are the kind of people who will call you on your nonsense, that he had a boy who likes hats and lights and is afraid of baths. He told her he had done his job and would keep doing it and that he did not know how to be merciful in court paperwork, but he would learn if the city would let him keep his job long enough.

At the jail Brett received a letter on good paper—a thick, stubborn sheet that had come from a stationary drawer someone might have gotten at a yard sale. The guard slid it in with a neutrality Brett appreciated because it meant the man had learned not to read out loud with his eyebrows. The return address was not a name so much as a symbol, a circle with a pin stuck in a place only someone from Boise would recognize. Inside, the handwriting was a careful block that looked like it had been taught by a teacher with a ruler and a sense of humor. It did not say I forgive you and it did not say I accuse you. It said, among other plain things, this: There’s a difference between holding and keeping. Holding is what you do so someone can catch their breath. Keeping is what you do when you decide their breath is yours to ration. The rest of the page spoke of a river that tells the truth and a city that will sometimes lie because it wants to feel better faster. It ended with a sentence that should have been trite and wasn’t: I will remember you as a person and not as a headline. He read it three times and then put it back in the envelope and laid it under his pillow as if he were still a boy banking a tooth against the possibility of magic.

In a corner of the city no map marked with a star, Alma and Poppy and Edna built something small and stubborn and, to anyone not paying attention, unimpressive. They collected used shoes from closets that had been shushed for years and wrote names in them with chalk that would wash. They tied pairs together with twine and hung them for a day along a certain fence by the path, hung low so a child could touch them and high enough that an adult would have to reach. They put a sign that said Please don’t steal, and under it Because these belong to people who will come by and recognize them, and under that We are making a museum for a minute and then we will take it down. People stopped and frowned and then smiled and then frowned again because sadness and delight are not enemies, and Poppy fielded questions like a matador. The city did not shut it down because the city had learned, through some miracle, that shutting down grief when it has organized itself is bad politics and worse ethics.

Winter hectically turned to a spring that was ashamed to admit it had been rude, and trees did the ordinary miracle they do, and people pretended to have seen it coming. The Greenbelt took on the sound of bicycles whose chains had been oiled by people who had finally remembered what maintenance is. The buddy system softened into a habit and then a culture. Alma allowed herself, once, to walk alone at a time of day June would have taken the path, not because she believed herself invulnerable but because standing in the place where harm has been dealt and refusing to be frightened is another kind of duty. She stopped on the bridge and looked down at the water, which had no idea how famous it had almost become, and she put her hands on the rail and thought of the napkin with its green leaf and its imperative. She still did not like being told what to do by paper. She said remember to the river anyway and decided, for that day only, to forgive it for being a repetition she could not control.

On a Thursday that did not know it was a landmark, the coroner called Cobb and said they could say with confidence that June’s feet had been June’s feet, which is not the way anyone wants a sentence to be constructed and yet it was the available phrasing. Cobb sat with the message like a stone in his hand and then called Hannah and asked if he might come by with someone who would say the words that would make the city’s file complete and her heart fractionally more so. He asked Alma to come because the request had come from Hannah and because he understood now that officers carry only so much tenderness before they start folding it into bad shapes. They stood in the niece’s kitchen and Alma watched the way the woman’s shoulders received the blow and did not break. She watched her sign the paper that turned a person into a certain kind of fact and she wanted to take the pen away and let it be a pencil instead so it could be erased if the world behaved in a better way later. She did not. She held the trash can steady while Hannah threw up and said nothing to make the act feel embarrassing, because bodies do what they do and policing them has never helped anyone.

The trial would come later, after motions that sounded like choreography and schedules that felt like punishment and a parade of experts who would speak slowly as if the jury were a room of children. Alma knew this. She had seen enough to understand how time weaponizes itself when it has been offended. She did not plan for it. She did what could be done now. She filled the planters with basil that grew like gossip and thyme that forgave neglect and rosemary that asked to be brushed so it could speak. She wrote letters she did not send to the desk of the teacher at Taft who had inherited June’s classroom and likely her pencils, and she left bread on the porches of the few houses where people had been kind without asking the world to clap. She took Joel to the skate park and let herself wince and then stopped wincing because this was the practice she had come here for—training the body to keep people alive without wrapping them in bubble wrap until they forgot how to be people.

When the first warm night came and the river made a sound like a promise it intended to keep, the city walked without being told. Alma and Poppy and Edna stood in their usual places and pretended not to be pleased. Cobb sat in his car and ate a sandwich he had not earned and told himself that was fine. Eva sent a photograph of a list with everything crossed off and the message that this was as close to victory as the day would allow. In his cell, Brett lay on his back and stared at the ceiling and recited to himself the names of streets as if they were saints, Grove and Bannock and River and Front, and he let the syllables add up to a geography that did not belong to him anymore and yet still lived in his mouth. He pressed his tongue against his palate and tasted a bitterness that was not mint, and he did not spit it out. He let it sit there until it softened and went away because that is the secret nobody told him when he was keeping jars—some things go if you hold still long enough and refuse to put a lid on them.

Alma dreamed, that night, of a ladder she had seen once in a painting in a church that smelled like beeswax and old women. Men were going up and men were coming down and there was, in the picture, the suggestion of fire and the certainty of a sky. In the dream she walked past the ladder and did not climb and did not descend. She put her hand out and steadied it so the men could place their feet more surely on the rungs. In the morning she woke and put on her jacket and went out into a Boise that had adjusted its pace without asking permission, and she took her place where the path narrows by the museum and stood there until the day had no choice but to admit she was part of the plan.The week after the vigil, Boise pretended at a calm that only held if you didn’t look directly at it. The mornings came on in squares of light as usual, and the Greenbelt took in the daily procession of strollers and sneakers as if it had not been the corridor where the city had learned something about itself it did not care to repeat out loud. Alma woke early and watched the basil’s small coin leaves lift toward the window as if they had an appointment with praise, and she could not help thinking of June’s hands teaching small bodies to stand, and of Mercy’s careful folded into a glass that would not forgive. She made tea and let it steep too long because bitterness felt honest, then set the mug down and pulled, from beneath the pile of mail, the unopened envelope with the county return address. She did not have to read it to know it contained a schedule made to look like a plan and a list of dates with the perfunctory language courts use when they are forced to speak about bodies. She slid her thumb along its seam anyway, not because she wanted it but because refusing to flinch had become its own practice, and folded each item into the part of her head that was both calendar and prayer.

The preliminary hearing took place in a courtroom that had been designed by someone who believed reverence could be sat into with the right weight of wood. The benches had a stubborn varnish that made you feel domesticated when you lowered yourself, and the state flag stood with the particular boredom flags have mastered. Cobb, in a suit that fit him like a truce, testified to the arrangement of a kitchen and to the dignities he had tried to keep intact while violating its privacy. He spoke in a diction he had learned to tame, keeping jargon in a side pocket and emptying it only when absolutely necessary, which is to say rarely. Alma sat three rows back from the aisle and let the room’s ritual perform over her head while she watched him choose verbs like a man laying down boards over water: steady, precise, just wide enough to bear weight without theatrics. Brett’s public defender was a study in restraint, and when he questioned Cobb about entry and warrants and the angle at which a camera had been lifted, the room was grateful for the predictability of the phrases. When Brett spoke it was only to confirm his name, the syllables brief and awkward in his mouth, as if he were being asked to introduce a cousin who had done something embarrassing at a wedding and whom he loved anyway.

She could feel the stare he didn’t give her as surely as she could feel the chairs pressing their policies into her spine. He watched shoes, not faces, in the way of a man who understood bodies from the ground up. The bailiff’s polished black pair, indifferent to the room’s dramas. Hannah’s flats, sensible and a little betrayed by the day. The jury pool’s seasonal assortment, not yet claimed by selection, looking like a parade of decisions made at outlet stores and saved for just such an occasion. He did not seek her, and that in itself was a kind of looking. When the prosecutor said the word dismember, Alma felt the grammar falter and wait for correction that never came. She thought of writing a note and passing it forward like a girl in the back row who had seen the answer and wasn’t sure whether it was her place to say. She didn’t. The judge, whose voice had been engineered to sound like a radio someone else had already tuned, reminded everyone that indictment was not conviction and that decorum would be observed or invented as needed. The room stood when told, and sat when told, and behaved as if obedience could be arranged like chairs.

When it was over, she walked out into the air and felt that first, stunned gratitude fresh buildings always offer after the electric hush of courtrooms. She stood on the steps with her hands in her jacket and watched the city move away from the doors and back into its errands, and in the stream she recognized the veteran by the set of his shoulders. He tipped his chin at her in a hello that did not require speech, and she fell into step without having to ask whether he had a direction. They went two blocks in silence and then he said, matter-of-fact, that he was having a hard time forgiving the room for its furniture. She said she forgave rooms easily and furniture not at all, and he laughed in that quick, uncondescending way that told her he had been surprised into metabolism. At the corner where a coffee shop had decided to name its sizes after mountains, he stopped and pointed his chin toward the river as if to say there’s your church if you need one. She knew he had no intention of going there right now and neither did she, but the gesture had been necessary. They parted like neighbors and not co-conspirators, which was a relief, because conspiracy took a toll neither of them needed to pay today.

The senior center returned to its regular work with a stubbornness that made Alma want to kiss its waxed floor. Poppy had introduced, with the seraphic cunning only a woman with earrings like saucers can manage, a weekly hour she called Keep Time, and the joke was not lost on anyone. It was an hour when the Buddy Walk foot traffic turned into a kind of choreography and older bodies practiced the art of keeping each other company with a precision the city should have made heroic. Edna declared the hour frivolous and then presided over it with the severity of a conductor, clapping her hands for tempo, tapping a pencil against a clipboard she claimed to loathe, and adjusting pairings with a matchmaking talent that rivaled grandmothers and gods. The boy with the fish hat had devised a card game to be played while walking; each card carried a task that was not quite a challenge and not quite a kindness, and the cards did their duty. Smile at someone you don’t recognize and say you look like you read. Count the blue coats. Stop and admire the willow like it will take offense if you rush by. Alma took a handful and distributed them as if she were handing out passports, and for a little while the city wore the benevolent uniform of the slightly ridiculous.

At night, after the house had done that settling thing that made the cabinet doors sound like they were reconsidering their hinges, she took out a piece of paper that had not been an envelope and began a letter she had no plan for. She wrote Dear Mercy because she had been saying the name all week like a girl's prayer and the page demanded that shape of address. She wrote, in the firm, unpretty script she used when she was speaking to someone who required tensile strength, that she was angry at how easy it was for an idea of a woman to be borrowed for a project that took feet and called it shelter. She wrote that she had seen pictures of Mercy’s grave as notes in a file and had stood at that place where the ground admits it has eaten, not because she believed the dead needed company but because the living sometimes do. She wrote that her anger was not all she had and that some of what she felt for Mercy was gratitude, that a boy who had needed to be held had been held, however briefly, by hands that understood the tenderness and violence of keeping hot pans and small bodies from harm. When she was done, she did not sign it, and she did not fold it. She left it on the table under a bowl of lemons as if the fruit could impart any kind of mercy of its own.

Brett learned the geometry of afternoons, and how long a square can be when drawn in cinderblock and rules. He learned that the sound of a key card sliding through its slot makes a syllable a person can mistake for their name if they are not careful. The chaplain came and sat where light placed a small circle on the table, and they managed to talk in that ring without much of the rest of the room. The chaplain had a trick that wasn’t a trick; he waited the extra second that makes most people fill in the silence with the thing they meant to say after the thing they were about to say. Brett talked about the jars in the language of maintenance and habit and reverence, and the chaplain made that good hum in his throat when someone has leaned toward the truth but not yet touched it. Brett reached a different story without meaning to: a summer when Mercy’s forearms smelled like peaches and sugar, and she had told him to stand on a stool so he could pack halves into a jar in a way that made the arrangement look like a plan. She had said, watch the headspace, honey, and he had thought she meant look out for air the way you lookout for bees. He had learned something about the discipline of leaving room. The chaplain asked if anyone had taught him the version of that lesson he had missed. He thought of a teacher with a temper like a lighter and a man who had stood in a doorway just long enough to be called father and then had stopped showing up. He said no. The chaplain did not correct him. He asked whether the boy who had loved fireflies had ever been taken out to a field and shown the school of lights that happens when you stop trying to collect and walk into congregation. Brett said he had not, and then he stood up because he did not know what to do with the feeling that arrived after the word not, which was a feeling like a bruise being pressed and released and pressed again.

Alma had resisted the urge to ask for a visit because she had become wary of the device where people go to confront the perpetrators of their harm and find within the walls a parody of intimacy. She wrote instead. She said words she trusted on paper more than in a room where someone else controlled the clock. The letter with the map pin for a return address had cost her more attention than she liked to admit, and when a reply arrived—if that is what you could call a single sheet with a single paragraph that had taken twelve tries to say—she allowed it to sit on the table while she rearranged the silverware drawer and watered the thyme before she brought her body to sit in a chair like a grown woman. The paragraph was neat and incorrect and not at all defiant. It said he had read her difference between holding and keeping as if it were a liturgy he might agree to, and then it asked, plain as a child, whether holding had a timer on it and who set it. She wrote back that people set it and you tell them when it runs out and they put their hands on yours and help you loosen your grip because that is what it means to be human and not a doctrine, and she wrote that if you are a person who has had to set your own timer your whole life then you overcorrect and you try to make the no sound like a song. She did not mail it. She took the letter with her when she walked at dusk, with the lanyards put away because theater had served its time, and stood by that half-busted light that called moths and pretended not to be a halo. She let the paper take the river air and hoped it would believe that the world had more ways of timing than watches.

Eva kept her desk like a stage and her files like the scenery that would change even if the play did not. She navigated the office with the talent of someone who had been taught to carry trays through rooms full of sharp elbows and had learned to tilt just enough to avoid bloodshed. Men came to stand in her doorway when they wanted to congratulate themselves on learning a new word like restorative and then left muttering when she asked what restoration required besides the word. Her boss had started quoting Alma without knowing it, and the sentences that came out of his mouth had a clumsy earnestness that made her almost love him. She took home work she should have left because boundaries were a practice, not an inheritance, and she sat on Alma’s couch with her legs tucked under her and read aloud the parts of policies that might soften if a woman said them, while her mother stood in the kitchen with her hands in a bowl of dough and corrected small, vital words. They returned to the matter of keep as if it were a dog that needed constant training, and by the end of the night they had not so much finished the thought as fed it and put it to bed with the courtesy due any creature you plan to rely on.

One afternoon at Morris Hill, where the ground tells a different story depending on the angle of your knee, Alma met a girl who had come with a small spool of ribbon and was tying it, with bureaucratic neatness, to the handle of a vase that had known three mothers. The girl—no, not a girl, a woman with the kind of posture that starts on long bus rides and never quite surrenders—apologized for crying by saying her grandmother would laugh at her for wasting water on grief. Alma said nothing kind and nothing unkind. She asked about the ribbon, and the woman said names, as if that explained it. She wanted the names to hold each other by their handles. Alma nodded because she had seen worse methods and fewer honest ones. She told the woman that sometimes tying is a way to keep a place from forgetting, and the woman said she had not been raised to tie things outside and had only just learned to do it without thinking of censure. They stood for a while, as if the dead might write them a line if they were polite and waited on the porch. No line arrived, but a crow did, and the woman laughed because crows have a way of stealing solemnity from rooms where no one else has the nerve.

The city made improvements that were sensible and cheap, and the improvements made few people happy and most people a little less frightened. New signs were posted, not with threats but with invitations to notice. The path was repaved in sections that had pretended not to need it. The bushes that had been allowed to grow into small arrogant citizens were trimmed to a humility that did not wound them. Volunteers invented titles and then backed away from the seriousness of those titles, which is a Boise talent. A mild controversy rose like biscuit dough around the idea of security cameras, and the argument turned into a different argument about who gets watched and under what light. Alma was tempted to pour gasoline on the conversation and light it for dramatic effect but chose, instead, to teach one of Poppy’s friends how to copy records of who had asked for footage and why. Good mischief soothed her.

The next time she saw the veteran he was not on the path and he was not in church but in the aisle of a grocery store with lighting meant to flatter oranges. He had a basket with two items in it, and the spare righteousness of his shopping made her stop her own cart as if it were a dog she could make heel. They nodded, and he made a small show of investigating the cereal boxes like a man performative about fiber. He said he had been thinking about ladders. He said he had always thought Jacob’s ladder was a bad metaphor for the world and a good one for stairs, and that the painting in his mind had men going up and down while angels stood next to it holding coffee, unimpressed. She told him that in her dream of the same ladder she did not climb because someone had to keep it steady, and he laughed in a way that made her imagine he had once argued with officers about the placement of ropes. She put her hand on a box of dry pasta as if stabilizing it could count for anything, and when she saw his glance drop, just once, to her shoes, she felt that old surge of tenderness and anger combined in a heat she would never get used to. They parted without resolving anything. He impolitely refused to be a symbol for her, and she was grateful.

At the jail, the rhythms of the place became a boring mercy. Brett learned the names of the men you must learn, those who make the hallway a corridor you can pass through without being erased. He stopped counting days, not because time was meaningless but because he was trying to learn a pacing that had nothing to do with calendars. The public defender prepared him to hear the words he would hear, and he practiced hearing them without making the faces that would hurt him later. The chaplain tried him with a different angle, one that required a boy to look at the way he had loved not only wrong but lopsided, and he failed that lesson for a while and then failed it less. Letters came from people who believed in redemption the way some people collect stamps, and from people who believed in vengeance the way some people join clubs. He read them with the carefulness of a man who had learned to avoid the wrong kinds of sugar and then put them under the thin mattress like an animal stowing food it would not eat. When Alma’s second letter arrived, he let it sit on the shelf above the sink while he brushed his teeth, not because he did not want to read it but because he had decided to let himself want something beyond hands and jars and the roll call of streets. He read it slowly, and when it asked him a question he could not answer, he put it away and then took it out again and tried to write in the air the shape of an answer with his finger, as if the air were a classroom and he had a chalkboard he could erase without leaving a trace.

Detective Cobb went to a training he had avoided for three years because attendance meant admitting he might never improve by experience alone. The training was held in a room that had once been a gym and still smelled faintly of shoe rubber and shame. An earnest man with a treadmill’s voice used words like community engagement and upstream and harm reduction in the tone of a person who had been wounded by a spreadsheet and decided to heal with a chart. Cobb surprised himself by being patient. When a slide appeared with bullet points about trauma that looked almost precisely like the sentences Alma had spoken to him on a porch, he did not roll his eyes. He even raised a hand to ask whether the timestamp on a video mattered less than the person who had chosen to press record, and when he was told that this idea was novel and required more study, he did not let his face betray his opinion of the academy. He had never been more tired and never more interested in the slow labor of making himself less of a blunt instrument. Later, at home, he lay on the floor with his toddler and let the child stand on his back as if he were a hill designed for half-formed feet. The boy laughed and patted his father’s shoulder like a drum. Cobb lifted his head and made the noise that kept the boy laughing, and in the space between those repetitions he thought that maybe his job was less to catch and more to hold.

When the river rose, it did not do it dramatically, but it did it. Spring had decided to push from below as well as above, and the Boise began to carry itself with a little more swagger, which is to say danger. The city delivered the ritual sandbags as if they had a line item in their budget labeled humility, and volunteers appeared with the resigned gusto of people who have been taught to stack and have to unlearn complaining. Alma put on a pair of gloves that had seen more than one kind of emergency and made her body into the simple machine the job required. She stood in a line with teenagers who had learned their worth early and with old men who had finally found a use for their shoulders that did not involve argument. A girl with a crooked tooth thanked her for being there, and Alma said she did not deserve thanks for lifting a bag and placing it where someone told her to put it, and the girl nodded because she had already learned something about merit and modesty and how to pass a bag without turning it into theater. When a pile had been made and another needed making, a call went down the line and back up again, and the refrain felt as secular and holy as any song.

The water’s brashness gave Alma a chance she had not realized she had been craving. The town had something other than trauma to manage, and it managed it with people who had done this before and people who had never and were delighted to discover that the body can be useful with only the right instruction. It should have been purely good, that afternoon of sand and small assignments, but people are not designed to be purely anything for long. Across the street two boys whose mouths were older than their bodies made jokes about jars they should never have made, and Alma felt the old surge in her forearms that had once led to fights she had not started in countries that did not know her. She did not go to them and make of their laughter a teachable moment. She looked over their heads at the tree that had not chosen to be planted there and let herself count to thirty in a language she had not used for years. When she released the count, the desire to lecture had gone out of her like a fever. She lifted another bag and handed it off with the small grace of someone who knows that in any chain the person who says please and thank you is often the one keeping the whole thing from breaking.

Poppy brought cookies because holy events require them, and she arranged them on a foldout table with the solemnity of a museum exhibit and the swagger of a woman who has seen men admire store-bought sugar with a reverence usually reserved for relics. Edna stood beside her and kept a ledger for no discernible reason, recording who took oatmeal and who took chocolate chip as if preferences were patterns and patterns might one day form sentences she could trust. Alma took one and ate it without tasting it and then felt guilty for using ritual as fuel, and Poppy hit her on the wrist lightly with a plastic tongs and told her to get another and do it correctly this time. On the periphery, Joel performed tricks on his scooter for a small audience of three, then four, then more, and when he fell he did it with the kind of grace that turns collisions into practice, and his mother watched with the resigned pride mothers cultivate to keep from vibrating out of their skins. Alma called, later, over the hedge, that his helmet looked like it was doing its job, and Joel said it was new and then told her an extremely long story about stickers that did not adhere to anything and ended with a vow to design his own adhesives when he grew up. She promised to invest, and he bowed with a flourish she suspected he had stolen from a cartoon knight.

The day the spruce on her block dropped its blue-green needles in a quantity that made sweeping feel like an ethics class, a letter arrived from a woman who had chosen to sign only with the word Sister. It wasn’t a religious word in this case; it had the tone of a woman writing from a kitchen table where another woman had frequented, something like a tenant of grief learning the language of the landlord. Sister wrote that she had walked with the Buddy Watch and then had walked alone, and she had felt, for the first time in years, the sensation of being shadowed by someone who wanted nothing from her and might be an idea. She asked, in the careful hand that suggests a person who had been scolded in school for not being careful enough, whether Alma believed a city could teach itself to keep without clutching, and whether that lesson, if learned, would forbid the uglier teachers from being hired. Alma wrote back that cities have the same talents people do and the same failures, and that if you wanted to instruct a town you did it at kitchen tables and under bridges and in senior centers with bad coffee, and you did it by allowing people to practice love in public without turning it into spectacle. She added, without flourish, that if Sister wanted company on a certain walk she should say what time of day and what her shoes looked like so Alma would know where to find her in the stream.

She thought she would not go to the jail because she had liked the angle of letters. Letters had let her write in a voice that was part battlefield and part kitchen and entirely hers. But a morning came when she woke with the old desert directly under her skin and knew that not seeing a face had become, for her, an indulgence. She called and arranged the thing like she was booking a haircut she didn’t want, then drove with the steady speed of a person who refuses to let the body click into grief. The room was designed to be exemplary of nothing, and she admired it for that; it was not making a case for itself, which was new. Brett came in with a calm he had engineered, and he sat with his hands positioned as if he were about to take a test he had studied for. They looked at each other like polite enemies who could have been friends if introduced twenty years earlier in a part of the city with better light.

He said hello in the tone of a person who tries to make each letter of that word apologize. She said his name because she wanted him to exist in the room as a person and not as a case. There was a buzz and a click and a guard stationed himself as if the weather needed watching. She held her own breath first so she wouldn’t have to forgive herself for forgetting. He asked, more bravely than she had expected, whether she had ever kept a thing without permission and then begged it to forgive her. She said yes and said the thing’s name and then refused to say what, because naming everything is not a kindness. She asked him whether he had learned anything yet from waiting he could not have learned from work, and he seemed genuinely startled by the possibility that waiting had any currency at all. He said the chaplain had told him about warmth and release and he did not understand why the body had been designed to let go if the heart took so long to catch up. She said she didn’t believe in design; she believed in practice. He said he had practiced keeping, and she did not disagree, because part of being honest is not disagreeing with the obvious.

She asked him, with a steadiness that came not from anger but from an old drill sergeant’s voice in another life, whether he understood that what he had called mercy was domination in a tone the world had taught him would be forgiven because it looked like care. He flinched with a subtlety she did not note out loud. He said he had kept faces out of it because faces want more than men should take, and she leaned forward because she felt, under the table, a wire she had been looking for. She said, and heard herself enter a place in her voice she rarely allowed other people to hear, that he had not kept faces out of it at all, that he had rearranged faces, the way you rearrange items in a kitchen until they perform a function you can name. He looked like a boy who had been told to stand and found he couldn’t because what he was standing on was not floor. They sat for a very long time while she let the room do its job and he let her gaze construct a perimeter he could not reseal.

When she stood to go, he did, too, and the guard lifted his chin in a way that reminded everyone of the rules. She told him that anyone who brings a napkin to a river and writes remember on it has already been forgiven by someone and that he would do well not to mistake that forgiveness for absolution. He nodded, and the nod contained more than agreement and less than capitulation. She left with her spine straight and her stomach making small reconstructions of disagreement with her backbone, and outside she leaned against the wall in the shade like a woman who had just finished moving a dresser.

June’s funeral settled itself into the city’s memory like a superior recipe: talked about, occasionally attempted, hard to ruin because the ingredients were clean. When the last dish had been washed and returned, when the last letter had been mailed with a stamp chosen for its stubborn little picture of a thing that survives winter, when the last acquaintance had attempted a condolence that made eyes politely downcast, Hannah did an anticlimactic thing. She bought socks. She said, to the woman who took her money as if it were a sacrament, that her aunt would have insisted. She left with a bag that was not a symbol and went home and put the socks in a drawer and felt, for ten seconds, a species of peace that scared her enough that she laughed to wake herself from it. She called Alma and invited her to eat soup on the porch in defiance of the calendar and the temperature, and they did, and they discussed herbs like they were old rivals and not allies. On the railing, a line of birds catalogued the event and then forgot it, which is the gift of birds.

Summer leaned in without subtlety, and the path became, again, the city’s narrow place. Edna invented the Slow Race, which was neither slow nor a race but a gentle contest in which pairs of elders attempted to walk the longest distance in the longest time without losing their balance or their dignity. Young people volunteered to be the audience and discovered, to their great relief, that being an audience can count as work. Poppy measured and timed and insisted on snacks, and her ferocity about hydration would have done a paramedic proud. Alma stood at the finish line that was not a line and said nothing about victory and everything about what it means to stop at the same time on purpose. Cobb came in plainclothes with his boy on his shoulders and, when asked by a grandmother whether he was a cop, said he was a tired person and got a laugh he did not deserve but accepted. Eva arrived with her hair still damp from a shower she had made happen and took over the registry with an ease that suggested she had been born holding a pen and telling other people where to sign.

There were moments of relapse because the city is not a creature you can discipline into perpetual wisdom. A prankster left a jar with river water and stones on a bench with the word keep scratched into the lid, and someone found it and someone else found the someone and the police heard about it quickly enough that no news story had to be born. Alma would have liked to catch the boy and shake him, not for the offense but for the laziness, and when she saw him later—because Boise is a loop and contrition is a ring—she gave him a job carrying chairs that were deliberately awkward to lift, and he did it badly and then better. The community center bulletin board acquired a new flyer that offered a class called Remembering as a Practice, and Poppy refused to approve the font until the instructor brought her a pound of coffee, which is to say quality control had been restored.

On a night when thunderstorms had chosen to conduct their business on another side of the mountains and the city felt like it had gotten away with something, Alma sat on the foot of her bed and sorted through the small box she had been pretending not to need. It contained letters from Owen, a photograph she was ashamed to love, a ticket stub from a dance she had attended in a dress she had allowed to apologize for nothing, and the napkin’s twin, a blank one she had taken from the same café months back and kept for no decent reason. She held it up to the lamp as if the absence of ink could be a message, and then, without drama, she wrote on it in the green pen she kept for grocery lists. She did not write remember. She wrote release. She put it in the book where other things were pressed until they became a different state of themselves and closed the cover. She was not naive enough to think a word placed in a book could change a city or even a kitchen. She was audacious enough to think it might slightly alter the air that moved between her lungs and the basil every time she breathed near it.

By the time the first peaches arrived on folding tables at the market, Brett had developed the habit of reciting particular streets to himself as if they were task lists for the muscles of his face. He had stopped dreaming of jars like seminaries, and when he thought of Mercy it was not with the old choreography of grief but with something like a film of dust he could write his name through and then blow away by mistake. The chaplain had taught him a prayer that contained no names and no nouns and he had resisted it until the day he did not, and then he said it three times and did not notice until after that his shoulders had lowered themselves a fraction. He no longer thought he could repair the world with an arrangement. He wondered whether he might be allowed to join it again as a person who could hand someone a bag in daylight without rehearsing the angle of his elbow. He did not imagine forgiveness as a well he could drink from. He imagined it as a bench he could sit on without being arrested for loitering.

Late that summer, Alma went down to the museum where the woman with the beautiful old voice had returned with the saxophonist and a folding chair that caught the light like a small stage. She stood at a distance that let the music do its work as air and not as statement, and she let herself feel not proud but pleased, which is a softer cousin. The city had not been redeemed; it had not needed redemption because redemption suggests a clean reversal and that is not how anything works. The city had been complicated out loud, and people had practiced being part of its complications in public without asking for applause, and that was enough for a week, maybe two. She held her hands in front of her the way a person does when preparing to carry something potentially breakable and then, when the last song ended and the saxophonist nodded at the audience as if apologizing for their lungs, she put her hands in her pockets like a woman with nothing to prove. She walked home along the water that pretended to be simple, and when she passed the bench with the small indentation where a napkin could hide if it needed to, she did not look under it. She knew better than to test the city’s edge for sport. She let the night carry her heft without dropping it and listened to the cicadas nag the trees into remembering a sound they had agreed to make long before the river learned the word for keep.

The trial would come when the calendar insisted, with its shaped days and its windows of anxious waiting, and the paper would be heavy with adjectives no one would be paid enough to deploy responsibly. Alma, not interested in rehearsing grief’s lines before the director had called the cast, went on making lists, watering plants, and inventing small ceremonies that made ordinary days impose order on themselves. She wrote a sentence on a sticky and placed it by the mirror to join the others, then smiled because finally she had written something that did not read like a command. Today we carry and set down. The basil nodded as if in wind. The fridge made its modest song. Somewhere on Bannock, a house began to forget the exact weight of jars and to learn the new weight of absence, and the city, which had never been graceful and never been entirely clumsy, kept walking toward a version of itself only it could recognize when it got there.
