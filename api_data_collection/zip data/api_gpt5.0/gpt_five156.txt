The boy’s shoulder had slipped in the night and no one heard the quiet knock it made when the arm dropped out of its seat. He sat on the edge of the cot, bare feet not quite touching the tile, staring at the white line that ran along his clavicle as though it could answer him. It was a thin seam, the sort of thing people pretended not to see on each other, a trick of light, a childhood scar, a rumor only. It winked under the surgical lamp.

“Steady,” I said, and the boy nodded. His eyes didn’t look at me. They looked at the poster behind me, the one with the faded heart labeled in looping script that wasn’t quite any language, little arrows pointing to ventricles that were more like compartments. The place where blood was supposed to go. We still told the story of blood.

I cupped his elbow, thumb on the bony knob, forefinger under the joint. “Exhale.”

He breathed out and I pressed up and forward, feeling the roundness turn inside the shallow cup. For a moment there was resistance. Then a gentle, mortifying click. Not the wet sound of living tissue giving, but the sound you’d get from a child’s toy when you twist the arm back into place, and I felt a nausea that had nothing to do with the boy. It passed, and I kept my face even.

“There you are,” I said. “Keep it in the sling two days. Don’t show anyone your party trick.”

He grinned then, and that made things right. He hopped off the cot, the rawbone clack in his shoulder muffled by the fabric I’d wrapped around him. His mother thanked me, and her thanks had a jangling to it, too many words and none of them exactly fit, like she had borrowed them. That was true of most of us. We wore words left over from a long gone sponsor we refuse to name aloud.

When they were gone, I peeled off my gloves and stared at my hands. I had powder on my palms from the gloves, and the lines on my skin were too even, too clean. I flexed my fingers and watched the knuckles move under their neat caps. The lamp hummed, and outside, the apes were speaking to each other over the rooftops in a minding rhythm, deep-throated and full of breath. Their voices were the sea, and our clinic was a fragile raft.

“Dr. Quell.” Tamsin leaned against the doorjamb, her hair escaping her cap in coils. She’d cut it herself again, I could tell; the edges were jagged. She did not have steady hands unless she had a scalpel. “We have apes at the front again. The small ones. The gibbons. They want you to look at a throat.”

I glanced over her shoulder at the waiting room and the street beyond. It was all of them. You could never look anywhere and not see apes. They were on the awnings, under the stalls, looping through the wires that sagged like vines. Some sat, some knuckled along, some in military lines, and above them the sky was the color of dull ceramic. You had to squint to remember that it was sky and not a lid.

“Wouldn’t Ori be better for the throat?” I said. “He knows their anatomy better than I do.”

“He’s in the south wing, arguing with a stonemason about history again. And they asked for you. The old one said ‘the quiet hands.’ He meant you.”

The gibbons were chattering in the waiting room, bright eyes, slender wrists. One of them had a cloth wrapped around the neck, and his chest rattled when he tried to speak. I could see his larynx under the fur, delicate and hard.

“Please,” the larger gibbon said. His words were too precise, prised from a mouth that was never meant for them. “He swallows and something catches.”

I put on new gloves. Tamsin held the tray. The gibbon child bowed, which made me want to touch his forehead and tell him there was no hierarchy here, but there is always hierarchy. There is always an altar and a cut.

I examined the mouth with a light and a tongue depressor carved from an old ruler. The mucosa was very pale. The tonsils were like dull little seeds. There—at the back—something caught the light, not in the flesh but in it, a foreign glint under the surface, and when I pressed gently, the tissue didn’t bleed. It whitened a little, like plastic when you bend it too far.

“Food?” Tamsin said under her breath.

“If only.” I had seen this before. The older apes called it frosting, though the first time I heard that word I laughed. Frosting belonged on cake. Frost was for mornings. But this was a bloom, a chalky rising up from the inside, a dryness at the edge of joints, a dust that tasted sweet. If you whispered it, it sounded harmless: white antigen, polymer fatigue, just old age. It was neither harmless nor old.

“We’ll have to clean it out,” I said. “And give him the rafts. He’ll hate the taste.”

The gibbon child blinked solemnly. He did not fight, but when my instrument touched that place at the back of his throat, the chalky line crumbled. Underneath the speck was a tiny hole, too perfect. A sprue, the others joked. A place where life had once flowed into him. I did not joke. I swabbed with solvent, the good kind, the one Ori smuggled from the depots and swore he didn’t. The chalk went away. The tissue—whatever it was—shone again. Your heart would stop if you let it.

“He’ll need to be gentle when he eats,” I said. “No dry things. Warm water morning and night. And the rafts. Four drops.”

“Thank you,” the elder gibbon said, and he reached for my hand. For a second his palm met mine, warm through the glove, rough with lines that were too even, the whorls too simple, like a stamp. We both withdrew at the same time. A gesture, not a touch.

Outside, a bell rang somewhere in the city, and the troop at the balcony rails turned their heads as one. Ori strode in from the side hall, papers tucked into the waist of his coat. He wore a coat to humor me; he never needed one. “Mara. You’ve been avoiding me.”

“Is that what you tell yourself,” I said, wiping down the instruments. “How goes the argument with the stonemason?”

“He insists the city was built from the bottom up. I insist it was placed. He said, by whom, and I said: by the same hands that made the grooves on your table.”

“Please don’t say grooves while I am operating,” Tamsin said. “It puts me off. Also, the general came by.”

Ori’s head lifted, the orange fringe around his face bristling a little. “Thrum.”

“His runners asked if we’d see him. He is bringing someone.”

“You could say no,” Ori said. “People say no to generals all the time.”

“Do they,” Tamsin said. “When was the last time you said no to anyone and survived it with all your limbs.”

I dried my hands on a towel that had been fresh yesterday. It had a single blue stripe down the side like a tally mark. The fabric left lint on my palms. That lint got into the seams of my skin if I didn’t wash it out. We had lost a man that way last spring—Sevi, with the boat—and I didn’t want to lose another.

“Let him in,” I said to Tamsin, and then to Ori, “but wait with me. If this is what I think it is, I want you.”

“If it is not what you think,” Ori said, amused, “what then?”

“Then we’ll owe him a drink, and he’ll tell decorated stories about it, and I’ll beg him to take them somewhere else.”

The general entered with only five escorts, which meant he wanted to scare me instead of everyone else. He was massive, his back a broad plane, a plume of silver up the spine. His hands, when they hung at his sides, were like small tables. The apes behind him were young, their coats glossy, their mouths hanging open just a touch. Awe has drool in it sometimes. It does not suit anybody.

“Doctor,” Thrum said, in a voice that rearranged the air. I had to stop myself from squaring my shoulders. “Thank you for seeing us without prayers and fuss.”

“I accept prayers,” I said. “I just don’t invoice for them.”

He grinned, a savage expression that was nevertheless polite. He raised his hand, and two of his escorts carried in a litter. On it lay a young gorilla. His eyes were closed, his lips drawn back to show the line of his teeth. The gum had receded in odd scallops. At the corners of his mouth, there was that dust again. He wore a sash of woven plastic that someone had taken a lot of time to braid. Someone loved him, then. That never helps and always does.

“This is Mal,” Thrum said softly. “Son of Hark.”

The King. There were two kings, depending on who counted—Hark, who ruled the hill of amphitheaters and the dry riverbed where the apes gathered at dusk like autumn, and Avery, who had spoken for the humans from the steps of the Registry until he fell three days ago in the square, his head cracking like a bowl. We had wrapped him and sent him into the apes because that was their custom, and they had carried him above their heads like a piece of church. He had been my friend. He was not my king.

“What happened,” I asked, though I could see it. The powder at the eyes. The brittle line at the wrist. The careful way they had set his leg to keep it from locking. The Knicks—little white stress lines—on the chest where someone had tried to revive him by pressing.

“He stopped moving,” Thrum said. “Then he forced a breath, and then he stopped again. He says his bones are dry. He says his tongue does not belong to his mouth.”

“He talks,” Tamsin said, startled.

Thrum glanced at her, then back at me. “He spoke last night. Today he makes whisper sounds like the wind through a bag.”

I touched the gorilla’s chest. It yielded and sprang, but not in a way that had anything to do with flesh. Under my fingers there was a different rhythm. We have hearts, we said. We say it. But there was something in him that was not blood, a humming like an old radio.

Ori leaned in, his eyes narrowed. “What do you want of us,” he asked the general, though he already knew.

“Save him.” Thrum did not look away. He did not say, if you don’t, there will be trouble. He did not have to. He was a general in a city where apes outnumbered everything else. The trouble was the air.

“I will try,” I said. “I have done this for your elders and our children and for the men who work under the shelves. I can’t promise that it will hold.”

“It will hold,” Thrum said. “Do you like the sound of orders, Doctor? Every time I say it, you stiffen like a rope pulled taut.”

“Bring him to the east room,” I said to Tamsin, ignoring the general. “Ori, heat the solvent. The good one, not the beige. The beige clogs.”

We flanked the litter and moved as if we had a purpose that we could name. At the door, Thrum’s hand brushed the charm that hung on his chest, and I saw that it was not a charm at all. It was a piece of transparent plastic cut from a box, the folded corner of a display. There were numbers printed on it, and the numbers meant nothing. He wore the numbers like a saint’s relic.

I had the assistants hang lamps around the table until our shadows dimpled and multiplied. The hum rose and fell. I cut the sash gently with a pair of shears that said “EEL & CO.” on one blade. The letters were worn almost smooth, but you could feel them as a relief under the metal. Toys, Ori had said once. We are all toys. We kept laughing until we didn’t.

The first incision was not an incision in the way my teachers called it. There was no obedient skin that parted and bled and held its own counsel. There was a seam along the chest where the color deepened, and when I scored it with the knife—fine, fine—the line softened. Solvent, then. The clean, cold drip of it, the smell that everyone said they hated but that had a sweetness under it that made your brain smooth out. The seam opened like a door.

Inside Mal it was everything and nothing like a body. The crossbars where our ribs should be. The cavities too regular. The white bloom on the edges where stress had made it brittle. The tiny hole near the sternum with a raised lip: injection gate, sprue, we had a dozen names. I don’t know why it made me think of childhood. I had no childhood. I had scaffolding.

Tamsin did not look away. She never did, and that was why I trusted her. She counted my breaths and matched them in the corner of her mind. Ori made a low sound that was not disgust and not awe.

“Clicking at the scapula,” he said, and tapped with a fingernail. “He is tight. Loosen or he will lock.”

I did what I could. I warmed where I could and softened what needed softening. I scraped the bloom from the larynx, from the ribs, from the pelvis where no one of Mal’s years should have bloom, and every time I scraped, I wiped the blade against a cloth, and the cloth left lint, and I wiped the lint with solvent, and the lint went away as if it had never existed. Don’t think about it. Think about the boy with his shoulder. If you think about the cloth, you will fall into a hole.

“His heart,” Tamsin said quietly.

I put my fingers on the sled of his chest and felt the throb. It was there, and it was wrong. It shuddered like something that wanted to stop. It stuttered and then found itself again. I smoothed the solvent across the seam that ran under it. “You are not allowed to be doing this,” I said to the thing inside him. I said it out loud, because sometimes you have to tell them, you have to be rude with the body. “Not yet. Not now.”

I don’t know if anyone else heard it. But somewhere deep in Mal’s chest, something answered. It was not a word, not in any language. It was the sound of fingers drumming on a table, heavy, impatient, bored. It was a child’s voice saying a name it did not like the taste of. It was the sigh of something decided elsewhere, the sound the city made at noon when the light shifted, the way the houses groaned and the rope bridges shivered.

“Finish,” Thrum said behind me. “Please.”

I finished. I sealed what I had to seal and left what did not want to be touched. I warmed the flanks and flexed the joints and listened for the click that meant life could go on. When I closed him, I sprinkled the last of the powder we had that kept the bloom from coming back in a day. It was expensive. It was nothing. I would have poured diamonds into him at that moment if I’d had any diamonds to pour. He breathed. It sounded like a man trying to remember a tune.

Mal opened his eyes and met mine. For a second, the room went very quiet. You could hear the lamps. You could hear Tamsin’s throat as she swallowed. You could hear the city at the window, the apes and the rope and the wind, all of them standing on each other’s shoulders out there. Mal looked from me to Thrum and back to me, like I was a thing that would explain the world. I have never liked that feeling. I am better with bone.

“You have the quiet hands,” he said in a breathy little voice, and then he said something else, but it was not in a language we share. It was a noise that matched the numbers printed on the general’s charm. He smiled apologetically, as if he’d burped.

Thrum bowed his head. It made the room smaller. “You saved him,” he said. “I will owe you for this forever.” That is what the powerful say when they are about to spend you.

“You will owe yourself,” I said, and then I felt unkind. “He will need to come back. The bloom is not obedient. It returns. And the rafts, for the throat.”

“We will do everything you say.” The general turned to his escorts. “Carry him. Gently. If any of you drop him—”

“I will break your head like a bowl,” said the one with the smallest mouth, and then he realized he had said it out loud and looked at me and flushed under his fur. I didn’t say anything. We are all too familiar with the feeling.

The apes lifted the litter and filed out into the hall. The smell of solvent followed them and mingled with the food someone was warming on the stovetop in the staff room, a thin stew of greens and little dried meat pebbles that Tamsin says are protein but taste like the way rain smells in a factory.

“Dr. Quell,” Thrum said when the others had gone. He did not sit, because he never sat in a room with me. His sitting would change the shape of the room. “There is more.”

“Yes,” I said. “There always is.”

“The Assembly calls for a Chosen Chair. Avery has cracked and gone to the night. The apes will choose, as we always do, and the humans will clamor outside and throw their hats up and tell themselves that the wind is what chooses, and everyone will go home feeling clever. But the bloom grows. The shelves are not stable. The riverbed is coughing up wiring. If nothing passes laws and speaks into a long horn, it will take us all, and I cannot allow that.”

“You have the horns,” I said. “I have seen you speak into them.”

“And no one listens but apes,” Thrum said, baring his teeth. “We say we are many, and it has made us fearless. It has also made us stupid. The humans are fewer and so they count more carefully. They count the water, they count the dried meat pebbles, they count days. You count differently. You count pain. You are unlike us.” He paused. “I want you to take the Chair.”

I laughed immediately. It came out wrong. It sounded like a sob someone had taught to dress itself up. “You must joke.”

“No.” Thrum’s face did not know how to joke. He turned slightly so the light made a bar across his cheek. “You are already a leader. I have watched you cut and say go or stay, and they do as you say. You argue into the dark with Ori and pull Tamsin back from her silliness, and they are better. You can speak to a room and make it full of air. You can pull a child back from the floor. You can tell a general no and mean it, and still save his king’s son. If you sit in the Chair when the Non-Day comes, people will not die so very much.”

Ori blew out his breath in stages. He had climbed onto the low cabinet and sat with his long arms around his knees. “Non-Day,” he said. “That makes it sound polite. Say what you mean. Say: when the hands come down.”

“Don’t,” Tamsin said quickly. She touched her ear as if to stop something from getting in. She had a small notch there, a neat bite out of the rim. She might have been torn from something once. We all were.

“I won’t take it,” I said. “I won’t be what you want.”

“You already are what I want,” Thrum said, and I had not expected him to say that. He looked away. “It is not in my hands. The Assembly chooses. But I put names in their mouths. I can put yours.”

“How generous.”

“Do you want to live?” He said it like a real question. I loved him a little for that, which I suppose is the point of powerful men, that they make you love them five minutes at a time until there is no time left that is yours.

“Thrum,” I said. “We don’t know what the bloom is. We don’t know what the shelves are. We don’t know why, before the light goes, the entire city smells like sugar. We don’t know why some nights the sky has fingerprints and some nights it’s just gray. We don’t know why the riverbed coughs up wiring. We don’t know what we are. I’m a woman with a knife. You’re a man with men. What would I say in a horn that would fix that.”

“Say: the solvent goes to the clinics and not to the cosmetics factories. Say: the apes stop piling on the east wall because it will not hold. Say: the bridges are tired. Say: we will pull out the trellis in the river and use it to build roofs. Say: stop naming things like churches and start naming them like streets. Say: None of you leave a child in the box. Say anything. Say it so that we hear it. There is no magic. There is only the sound of a voice that makes us do it.” He lifted his hand and let it fall. “Avery had that sound. He left it. Take it.”

I put my hands on the back of a chair. I imagined the Chair—capital C, the one they pulled into the square when they made the Chosen sit so everyone could see their ankles and their teeth. I imagined my feet on the bar, the weight of the horn across my lap, the apes climbing the scaffolding to be closer to the sound, their greasy prints on the wood, the humans behind them not daring to push. I could feel the air then, full and terrible, the way it gets before a storm, the way it got before a Non-Day, the way you could feel the city brace itself and everything that didn’t belong holding its breath.

“I have patients,” I said finally. It was an answer that would not offend anyone. It also happened to be true.

“You have everyone,” Thrum said. His mouth softened. It made him look younger, like a boy I might have treated for a silly arm that wouldn’t sit right. “If you say no, I will pick someone else. It will be someone who can move a crowd. They will be loved for how they sound. They will not have cut into the chest of the son of Hark and seen that there is nothing there that looks like blood.” He held my gaze until I looked away. “He will return in two days. See to him. You will be at the Assembly at dusk. I will send an escort so no one thinks you are not important.”

He left without waiting for me to agree. That is how you make an agreement, sometimes.

The afternoon slid around us, uneven. I signed forms I had signed a hundred times, and none of us knew what they meant. A woman came in with a hand that had gone white in the night. I warmed it and painted it with a clear thin syrup and watched color return. Ori taught an apprentice to sand down a ridge behind the ear. Tamsin stacked boxes of gauze with the care of a librarian. In the next room, a boy listened to a radio that had only static and the hiss of a long hallway somewhere else. Then, just before the light changed, the entire building settled with a shiver, and none of us breathed. It is always the same. You feel it in your teeth. The dust lifts from the sill and falls again. The bell on the door rings without anyone touching it.

Non-Day began on a hinge you cannot see. The lamps went warm. The sky decided it was a different color just for the joy of it. The city was suspended by the suggestion of a wire. I put down my pen and heard a voice—not outside, not in the hall, but all around us as though the walls had learned to speak. It was a voice I knew. We all knew it. It was the voice that had said, “Now,” and all the apes had walked faster without knowing why. It was the voice that had said, “Stop,” and the river had stopped looking like water and like a roll of thread instead. It said a word I did not know, and a chorus from a mouth we never see answered it in the language of small kings.

I don’t believe in gods. But my knees wanted to articulate in a different way. Tamsin was beside me, her pupils huge. She offered her hand without looking at me, and I took it. The voice went away, and the edges of the day came back as if someone had rubbed them with a thumb.

“Do you feel like a person,” she said in a tone that made it a joke, and I laughed, because that is the trade we make for living.

When the bell for dusk rang again, it was a bell that someone had hung on a frame, not the sound of a hand unhooking us. We closed the clinic, and I wrapped my coat around me and stuck my hands in the pockets like a child. The pockets had crumbs. We walked in a line: Ori, Tamsin, my bag, my breath, a soldier at my elbow as quiet as oil.

The square was full already. It was always full. There were apes on the railings, apes on each other’s shoulders, apes in the spaces where the pipes came up from the underground. The humans were under the awnings, holding children on their hips. Some wore the old masks that you could buy near the river if you were a fool. They smelled like the solvent and made you see stars.

Three men were sitting on the dais that the apes had built from pallet wood and rope. They were called Speakers, though they were not always given a chance. One had a voice like a grinding wheel. One had a voice like a lullaby that makes you sleep with your eyes open. One had a voice like a box of nails being shaken. I had taken a pebble out of the first one’s knee once. He did not meet my eyes.

When they saw me, a sound moved through the apes. It is the strangest feeling, to be sound. I wanted to apologize to the ground for standing on it. Thrum was already there, seated even though he hated it, because that was what you did when you wanted others to think about sitting too. He nodded and patted the bench beside him, like we were old friends on a porch. I sat.

“Citizens,” the grinding wheel said into the horn. “Creatures. Family. Things.” He grimaced as if the word had burned his mouth, and if he had had a different face he would have said: that’s not what I meant.

He had a speech, and his speech had a feeling like a ladder with too many rungs too close together. He said Avery’s name and the apes grumbled the way the sea eats a cliff. He said virus and bloom and old age and fate. He said we will choose. He said today, tonight, now. He said, and now, a name from the apes that is not an ape. He gestured at me with an open palm, as if he had made me with his hand and was showing off.

I stood. The square shuddered. The horn was the color of distilled honey. You spoke into it and the city heard a version of you that was bigger than your mouth. I didn’t like it. But the boy with the shoulder had smiled this morning, and Mal had whispered numbers, and Tamsin’s ears looked so careful, and Ori had used the word placed like a knife, and the general had said please. All these little obedient things that made a day. I bent over the horn and thought about what I could make true.

“My name is Mara Quell,” I said. The horn loved my name. It made it into a song with tiny rattles in it. “I cut things open and try to make them better afterwards. I will not pretend I know anything about ruling a city except this: we are in a body. It is a good one, and a bad one, and it is tired. We must treat it like infants and old men at once.”

There was a ripple that might have been laughter in some corners and hunger in others. The apes are not dramatic by nature; they take their drama from us the way children steal bread.

“We will do what will keep us whole,” I said, and the word whole hit the back of my teeth like a coin. I said: the solvent goes to the clinics first. The bridges need reinforcement at the joints where the wood had whitened. No climbing on the east wall after noon. Every family will feed a human child this week who is not theirs. We will not say the words box or shelf or hand out loud for a week. We will not go under the river at night. We will take the trellis in the river and use it for roofs. We will let the dust in the square go, we will sweep it out and watch the wind take it, and we will not look at where it lands. We will remember that voices are stronger than arms if they talk all the time. We will stop painting small flowers over seams and call them what they are. We will not call them scars. We will not be ashamed of the lines on our necks.

It was not a plan. Plans are lists that someone else cuts up and weighs and finds wanting. It was a spell, if you like. There are days when you make a plan and days when you tell the day what it is.

Something else happened then, and I will say it plainly because I do not have another way to. The sky… introduced itself. It drew closer, the way a large person leans down to look a child in the eye. There was a shape moving behind the gray. There was a thumbprint, and in the thumbprint: dirt. There were colors beyond color, a block of orange that was not sunset, a scraping blue that smelled like peppermint and pennies. A voice laughed and called another voice by a name. It was bored. It gave the impression of something sitting cross-legged on the world. If I had believed in gods, I would not have believed in that. It was worse. The apes stopped moving. Not just stilled. Stopped. An ape on the rope outside the registry froze in mid-sway, and his hand went stiff on the knot, and his mouth hung open a little and stayed that way. A woman in the second-row crowd had her fist raised and did not lower it. I could see the hair on her arm in little rows, each one elegant and cheap.

Tamsin’s hand clamped on my wrist. It hurt. “Don’t,” she said, too loud. “Don’t look.”

I could not look away. Above the gray, the block of orange shifted, and I understood it, just for a second, as the cardboard of a sun that was never ours. It was nearby. There was plastic wrap in it. There was writing on it, backwards because it was above us.

Then it was gone. The room—the world—released us. The rope creaked. The woman’s fist came down. The apes who were mid-yell finished their yell with a little catch in the middle. Thrum’s hand, which had been wrapped around the charm on his chest so tight the plastic had creaked, relaxed. He looked at me. He, too, was an animal that had heard something outside his wall.

Someone had dropped something in the square and it had shattered like glass. But glass doesn’t shatter here; it breaks and folds and gets chalk on it. It had shattered. The sound made the back of my throat close.

“It’s just a day,” the lullaby voice said into the horn, hands raised as if to soothe us. “Just a Non-Day like any other. Thank you, Doctor. That was a very fine speech. We will go and talk now, old men and animals, and then we will tell the city a story about it.”

The stories the city tells itself are more important than anything we do on tables.

When I left the dais, my knees were aware of themselves. There was a mark on my wrist where Tamsin’s fingers had been. Ori stood with his arms crossed, his long fingers tucked in his sleeves like he was keeping them warm. “You have done it,” he said, not happily and not unhappily. “You will have to find a way to stop. There is no way to stop. That is the trick.”

“We should eat,” I said, because if I didn’t say something, I would say everything. “The stew tasted like pennies earlier. It might taste like something else now.”

“It will taste like victory,” Tamsin said, and then she snorted. “Sorry. Someone has to make jokes when the voice comes down, or else we all start naming the chairs.”

As we went back through the alleys, people touched my arm and then pretended they hadn’t. An old man with a mouth too wide said my name wrong on purpose and smiled to show he meant nothing by it. A little girl had a broken finger and showed it to me and I set it with a twig and a bit of ribbon. The tying made a noise like the tying had weight. The city settled into itself. We pretend it is a city like any other. We say streets instead of seams. We say river instead of runner. We say roof instead of lid.

At the door of the clinic, a boy sat with his back to the wall. The boy whose shoulder I had set earlier. He had a piece of paper folded in his hand. He looked up at me with an expression that said: I am brave until I am not, and then I will be more brave, like I just learned it.

“What is it,” I said, gentler than I would have been with a friend. We are at our most careful with the little ones. They are the only thing that makes any of this feel like a good trick.

He handed me the paper. It was covered in little black marks that did not confess to any language. They were lines and dots in rows and circles, with arrows pointing to arrows. My skin prickled when I realized what they were. They were instructions. They were the drawings you find in the bottom of an old box: how to move a arm. How to pop a hip back in. How to stand a man with a foot like that. They were ideas turned into steps. They were lies pretending to be help. They were everything I had done that day.

“Where did you get this,” I said, too sharp, and the boy flinched. “No. Sorry. It’s beautiful. Did you draw it.” I softened the way Ori uses heat for a joint. “Where.”

He pointed at the sky. He said a word that made no sense. It was a word that toddlers say sometimes when the Non-Day comes and they cannot help themselves. A name, maybe. The way a dog says its own name by accident when it hears a whistle. He put his other hand flat on his chest and tapped.

He had found it in himself or under himself or in the air above his bed. It did not matter. The instructions were here. They existed. They had graphics we did not have the design for. They had a smile printed in the corner with a head shape that we did not share.

“Keep it safe,” I said, and folded the paper the other way so that the smile went to the inside. “Keep it secret.”

He nodded solemnly. “Doctor,” he said. “Were we chosen.”

“For what,” I said, although I knew what he meant. Children always cut the question to its real.

“For—” He hesitated. He made a popping gesture with his free hand, their favorite game, the arm out, the click in, the hello of the joint, the goodbye. “To be here.”

“We weren’t not,” I said, and he accepted this as if it were wisdom.

I watched him go, his sling snug around his shoulder, his little legs working hard to get him under the bridge before the lights went down. The apes were bedding themselves in on the beams and in the trees. There are never enough trees. There are more apes every time you look, small ones hanging from the larger ones like ornaments, old ones with backs like benches, middle ones whose faces do not tell you anything at all because they have learned not to. We learned it from each other.

Upstairs, I pinched the skin at my wrist until the seam under it protested. There is a way the light catches the edge of it that makes you feel like a liar. The city made a sound like it was shifting deeper into a groove. I put on the kettle and watched the steam rise, not because I wanted tea, but because the water remembers heat in a way that we do not. It makes me feel less like a person and more like a thing that also works.

The door creaked. Tamsin came in with hairpins in her teeth. She shook her head so her loops fell down around her face, and she plucked the pins out one by one and stuck them into the cushion I used for elbow pads. “You were good,” she said. “You didn’t say hand.”

“I wanted to,” I said. “My mouth is full of that word.”

“We most of us are.” She leaned on the counter and watched the kettle pretend to think about boiling. “You saved the king’s boy.”

“I unbloomed him. It will return.”

“You saved him.” She shed her cap and rubbed the mark it had left on her forehead. The skin sprang back in an orderly way. “And you didn’t give the solvent to the cosmetics factory.”

“I make so many decisions each day,” I said, and my voice was thin. “Half of them are the distance between a thing working and a thing that shatters. None of them are the distance between what we are and what we are.”

“You’re the only one who says that out loud,” Tamsin said. “That’s why I work with you. Ori says it with his eyes, but he is a show-off and also he thinks we were placed. I think we were put here. Different.”

“What’s the difference,” I said, but I knew.

“Placed is gentle. Put is impatient. Whoever did it was not gentle with you,” she said, and went to her own room.

I poured the hot water into a cup and watched it steam. For a moment, reflected in it, I saw a ceiling that was not ours. A grid that was too perfect. A light that hummed with a noise that made my teeth hurt. A shadow crossed it, big as a city. And then I blinked, and it was only a cup with steam, and my hands holding it. The cup had a crack that had not yet been allowed to go all the way through.

The next morning, my name was a taste in the mouths of strangers.

At dawn, the Assembly sent a runner. He had a scrap of paper and an expression that said the paper mattered more than he did. “Sit,” he told me. “Nine o’clock. Bring your own horn.” He waited, perhaps expecting me to laugh. When I didn’t, he laughed for me. “Joke. Nice.”

I tore a piece of bread and chewed it until it was a paste. It did not taste like anything. It did not even taste like pennies. The city had decided flavor was not a priority.

We walked through sprays of apes, who parted for us because we had a soldier and because we had yesterday on our faces. I kept expecting my name to run back through the crowd like a whisper, and sometimes it did, but more often it was the sound of hands attempting to clap and not understanding why the hands weren’t catching. A woman touched my sleeve and told me I had helped her mother with a hip. A boy told me I had been in his dream and dug a coin out of his cheek. A man lifted his hat and smiled, and the hat had a sticker on it with a picture of a ape and a human shaking hands and looking in opposite directions.

“It cannot be like this forever,” I said under my breath. “It will make us idiots.”

“It only has to be like this until you make the first thing that hurts,” Ori said. “Then they will remember that they do not like doctors.”

Thrum was waiting by the side of the dais. He had washed his hands, not because they were dirty but because he wanted to. He looked clean, which is not a compliment or an insult; it is a posture. “I dreamt about you,” he said, and then squinted as if he had mislaid a word. “No. I dreamt about the sound of your voice. There was a… plastic ow. A wrapping. I could not get my fingers in to pull it away.”

“Stop,” I said, too quickly. He looked at me, and I let him have that look. “Stop,” I said again softly. “You can tell me later. Or never.”

“It would be easier to rule if we let ourselves say what we saw,” he said.

“You don’t want easier,” I told him. “You want us.”

“We want to not die,” he said. “I will take whatever comes with that.”

Before he could say more, the grinding wheel banged a stick on the edge of the dais and called the meeting to begin. I sat, because there was nothing else to do. I put my hand on my lap so it would have somewhere to go. The sun was something you pressed your palm against until it left a mark. The apes like the sun better than we do. That is the story I tell myself about why they are always where it is, and we are always in the shade.

The first order of business, we were told, was the solvent. The second was the east wall. The third was the flowers in the square that someone had been painting over the seams of the bricks. The fourth was the Chair. That was how the grinding wheel said it: the sol-vent, the east wall, the flow-ers, the Chair. He broke everything down and smoothed it with his voice until it almost went away.

While he spoke, I let my eyes be fools. I let them wander. A sparrow hopped at the edge of the dais and pecked at nothing. It turned its head and looked at me with a black bead eye and then leapt into the air. It landed on a section of rope that had a tag on it with series of numbers. The numbers were familiar. I had seen them on the general’s charm. I had seen them on the instructions the boy had shown me. I had seen them on the display boxes Ori kept tucked under his bed like a secret girlfriend. The sparrow pecked again and then flew off. Its wings made a sound like paper.

“…will accept the name of Mara Quell for the Chair,” the lullaby said, and I was there again in my skin. There was a cheer, the sort that happens when people want to be the kind of people who cheer for the right things. There were boos, too, smaller and more honest. Someone hissed. Hissing is always the right size.

“No,” I said, but it went into the horn and came back too big. People do not like to be shouted no at. I tried again. “I will sit if there is no one better. If any of you can stand here and say a thing that is both true and possible, I will sit at your feet and write what you say and put it into the horn. I will not pretend to know how to count the water or the pebbles. I only know how to make a neighbor get up in the morning and go to the clinic.”

There was a murmur. Thrum watched me with his chin in his hand like a man at the theater who has realized he likes a kind of music he thought he did not. Ori nodded slowly, then shrugged, then nodded again. Tamsin mouthed a word at me. It wasn’t hand. It was yes.

And then, at the edge of the square, something moved. It was a little movement, the sort of thing you would not notice if your lunch were better. A shadow came out of the shadow, and then resolved itself into a shape. The shape was tall. It had the wrong knees. It moved too evenly. It was a man, that was the story, because he had a hat and a coat and a way of keeping his chin down as if he had secrets, but he was not a man. He was an action. He was a figure drawn with a ruler. He walked up to the dais with steps that made no sound because the city was holding its breath for him. He held up a piece of paper. It was my instructions, and not.

He held it out to me. His hand had a seam. His fingers had the wrong knuckle. He did not look at me. He looked through me, as though there were something behind me that was brighter. On the paper were my name and a picture of a woman in a coat and a knife. The picture had hair that did not do what my hair did. The picture had a smile I do not own. The picture had a sticker that said: COLLECT THEM ALL.

He said, very carefully, very politely, into the horn: “Doctor. Leader. Model.”

And then he was gone, not like a person leaves but like a thought does, quickly, as if it had never consented to be yours.

The apes began to talk all at once about nothing, to cover the sound of my heart in my mouth. We all pretended very hard not to have seen him. That is another trade you make for living. You agree not to be aware of the proof.

Afterwards, in the corridor under the dais where people duck their heads because the beam is low and then forget why, Thrum caught my sleeve. He looked… not afraid. The opposite of afraid. Starving. “What was that,” he said, his voice a whisper that could have broken plywood. “What are we.”

I could have lied. I could have told him a nice story about humans and apes and cities and always and never and forever. I could have said: there are gods and they love their toys. I could have said: we are chosen, like the boy asked. Instead, I said: “I have a scalpel and a cup of solvent. I have Tamsin and Ori. I have this piece of paper that I want to burn and cannot bring myself to burn. I have a little boy with a shoulder I will check tonight when the lamps are too warm. I have a speech at dusk. I have an appointment with your son in two days.”

“That is not an answer,” he said.

“It is the only one I have,” I said, but there was another, and it was this: we are made, and we make. Which matters more depends on the day.

The city vibrated, lightly, as if someone had knocked their knee against the table again. On a balcony across the square, a gibbon coughed and then laughed, and the laugh turned into a cough again. The rivers of apes on the stairs and on the scaffolds and on the branches and on the roofs and on each other’s shoulders poured themselves into the paths home. It was evening. The lights hummed. The lamps along the registry flickered in unison and then held. Somewhere above us, a voice called for someone named dinner, and someone else answered, and for one fractional second the lid of our world lifted, and we all saw each other, me and Tamsin and Ori and Thrum and the boy with the shoulder and the gibbon child and Mal and the sparrow and the figure with the wrong knees and the ones who had made them and the ones who had not, all of us caught between someone else’s fingers. Then it came down again, gently, impatient, the way a hand puts a figure back where it found it. We did not move. We held our poses, and then we breathed.

When I finally made it back to the clinic, our door had a new scratch on it. It was a deliberate scratch, a careful, neat half-circle that met another half-circle to make an O. Under it, a R and an I. Ori. He pretends not to leave his name on things. He had, that night. Under that, smaller, a T. Tamsin never signs her name. Under that, a M. Me. It looked like a production line. It looked like a list. I put my finger on the M and pressed until the groove hurt. This is a body. This is a city. This is a piece.

On my desk, the piece of paper the boy had given me lay with its corners turned up. I picked it up and held it in the light. The woman in the picture smiled past me, over my shoulder at the person holding me, at whoever had paid for me. Her knife was very shiny. Her hands were very clean. She had a note next to her that said: SQUEEZE LEGS TO MAKE ARMS MOVE. I squeezed my own leg as a joke, because sometimes you intoxicate yourself with fear. My fingers left dents that slowly, slowly went away. The kettle clicked in the kitchen. Someone knocked on the door, a polite knock that came from the wrong height.

“Come in,” I said, and did not look up. A hinge squeaked. The lamp hummed. The apes outside roared like the comfort of a drum. I told myself a story: that I could be both the one with a knife and the one in the picture, and that the ones above the sky were also only whoever they were, and that if I spoke into the horn with my real voice they would not hear me, and that this was good. I told myself that the world is made of plastics and ropes and knots and paints and breath and words, and that words are the one bit we get to make.

“Tamsin’s gone to get more gauze,” Ori said behind me. He sat down on the stool and clicked one joint and then another because he could not keep his hands still, and he will not admit that the sound soothes him. “Thrum sent bread, as if that is a currency where we are.”

“It is,” I said. “Today.” I looked at the picture again. “Tell me you did not see what I saw.”

“I did,” he said, and the simple truth of it made my shoulders drop. “Tell me you will sit in the Chair. If you do not, someone else will, and they will say the wrong words into the horn. They will say box out loud.”

“I will sit,” I said, surprising myself. The word slid cleanly. “And I will say, in my quiet hands voice, that we are made and we make and that in the gap between those we live.”

“That is very poetical for a woman who pretends not to be one,” Ori said, and he laughed, and I laughed, and then we were quiet because there was nothing else to do.

Night leaned its weight on the clinic. The lamps deepened. Outside, the apes slept where they had dropped or trussed themselves into small nests of rope. Somewhere a baby made a startled sound, and somewhere else an old ape answered as if to say: do not worry, not yet, no. The Non-Day came and went like a breath held by a child playing pretend. The solvent bottle on the shelf caught the light and flashed like an eye. In the morning, I would check Mal’s stitches and listen for the number behind his words. In the evening, I would sit and say not a prayer, and it would sound like one. The days would go on. The hands would knock the table. The city would give and hold.

Outside the window, on the brick where the paint had peeled back to show the line that ran down the face of the wall, someone had written a word with a finger in the dust. It was written badly, with the letters like little toy soldiers that had fallen over. It said: more. It might have been hope. It might have been a command. It might have been the only thing we ever say when we are honest.

I put my hand against the glass and left a print next to the word, and my print was simple and too smooth and mine. I left it there until the heat of my palm fogged and drove the letters back into the brick. Then I took it away. The world held its pose. The kettle clicked off. The door closed, quiet. The voice above us turned in its sleep.

And we, below, breathed into the shape we had been given and began, again, to move.Chapter 4

By morning the paper had curled itself like a leaf, which made me feel tender toward it even as I wanted to crush it up and feed it to the stove. I slid it under the bottom drawer of the cabinet where we keep the gauze, because hiding things in the clinic is my first language. Tamsin’s hair was braided to the left in an uncertain rope that would slip free by noon; she held pins in her mouth and spat them into the cushion with the bite of a body that likes to be useful. Ori was on a stool taking apart the lamp that always hummed louder than the others, coaxing the filament into the exact lie it needed to tell to keep burning. Outside, the apes were already on the rails and on each other, looking into the day as if it could be interrogated into politeness.

“You look like a person in a picture,” Tamsin said around a pin. “It’s not a compliment. They never sweat.”

“I sweat,” I said. “I do it wrong, but I do it.” I dampened a cloth and wiped my neck. The seam there made a little line of shine. “Is Mal’s runner here.”

“Not until afternoon. Thrum sent bread,” she added, as if bread could be moral, as if generosity from a general wasn’t a message written on your skin. She nudged a paper-wrapped loaf with her toe. “And this.” She held up a slim glass bottle and tapped it with her nail. The sound was thin and high and familiar. “Cosmetic solvent. The expensive kind. Sweet enough to give you thoughts.”

“We will not use it,” I said, and knew we would if the day asked it of us.

The soldier at the door cleared his throat with the politeness of a machine that had learned manners out of self-defense. “Doctor Quell. The Speakers want you to meet with the owners of the swath factories before the morning horn. They are excited about a compromise.” He said compromise like a child says sweets.

“The swath factories,” Ori translated under his breath. “Faces. The people who paint over seams and call it beauty.”

“Maybe they keep the city from choking on the sight of itself,” I said, softer than I meant to. We say we aren’t ashamed, but we are. The old women who line their necks with tiny flowers that call out the very thing they disguise. The boys who sand down their knuckles until they lose their fingerprints. The apes who braid their fur across the sternum where the seam darkens. There is always a little love in the lie.

We crossed the courtyard, which is always a garden in stories and always a place of buckets and rope in life. Apes held torches, the flame too calm for what it was. The dais had been left up, as if the city wanted to pretend that yesterday was still happening and tomorrow would be more of it. Thrum was already there, not sitting, his paws behind his back like a boy caught thinking about running.

Beside him was Vera of the Ribbon—Vera Lark, which is not her name, but the one the city gives her. She had a scar like a dashed line along the jaw that she had not painted over, which made me like her a little against my will. Her coat was slick and did not take dust. She looked at me with the frankness of a tax collector and the tiredness of someone who buys her own food in the market anyway because she does not trust the runners not to eat any on the way.

“We are not enemies,” she said without ornaments, and for a second I wanted to invite her to sit in my kitchen and drink very hot water until we remembered that names are a choice we make together. “We use what you use. We call it something else when we hold it. I need a third of your last drum.”

“You will get a tenth,” I said, before I could help myself. “And you will show Ori your recipes that keep the paint from creeping into the seams.”

Ori blinked like he had been tipped into something cold. He swung his feet and did not look at Vera.

Vera pretended to laugh and then did not. “Your guard will be bored if you say no this neatly. The Assembly says there is a shortage. I say there is poor arithmetic. Your clinics do not need what I need in the same way. I can keep a thousand from being afraid of looking at each other. Fear keeps hands from work. Work keeps us from—” She gestured up without looking up. “From visiting the other place too soon. How much is fear worth. You cut people open and you say: this much solvent for this much bloom. I say: this many jars for this many necks. I am not a fool about what’s inside them. But a city with people who are not terrified of themselves lives longer.”

She was not wrong. That was the problem with people like Vera. They were always almost right.

Thrum made a noise of gravel shifting. “We will not starve the clinics.”

“No,” I said, because ‘we’ is a power as well as a pronoun. “You will get a tenth. And dye. You will get the blue and not the copper. You will get a calendar we make together, and Ori will sit in your shop and take notes without telling you what he is writing. The factories will put up signs that say where the solvent goes first. They will tell the truth twice a week. If they don’t, the apes will go and stand in front of their doors and not move. It won’t be a siege. It will be a lesson. You will hate it. You will love it later. You will think it was your idea.”

Vera watched me without blinking, which is how you see seams in a person. After a moment she let the corner of her mouth move. “You were chosen.”

“For what,” I asked, people’s favorite question this week.

“To be the person in the room who is not fooled by a good coat,” she said, and when she walked away, I did not hate her as much as I had intended to.

The morning horn blew as if it had something to prove. A child climbed a rope as if his hands would turn into birds if the rope did not hold him. While the Speakers argued about the east wall and whether it was tired or only complaining, a runner whispered to me that the river had coughed up a length of trellis like the rib of a whale, and men were hacking at it with knives that dulled themselves on purpose. I pointed at Ori, who had started to collect the papers that fell off the dais like autumn. He went where I pointed, this once without argument, because he likes the river, even when it is only a vein under the tile.

I took the horn because my mouth was not interested in waiting. “No climbing on the east wall after noon,” I said again, because repetition is how you teach children and assemblages. “We will pull the trellis up now and strap it over the whitened joints like a shirt on a stubborn boy. The shelves—” I stopped myself, and the pause was a small violence in everyone’s ears. “The east wall wants to be reinforced. If you stand on it, you will make it proud and it will fall to show you how strong it is. Don’t give it the chance.”

People laughed because they were terrified; laughter and terror share a parent. Thrum tapped his chest twice, which is the signal among the apes for ready. He pushed runners into the lanes with the ease of someone who has moved armies into holes and called it shelter.

On our way there, through the market where the dried meat pebbles promised protein for thinking animals, we walked past a boy with his hand in a jar of sugar. He moved too slowly; the jar was too narrow. He could have taken his hand out empty and it would have come free, but he didn’t want to. I slapped the jar smartly and the glass pretended to be surprised and let go. He cried. I pressed a coin into his palm and didn’t look at his mother, who was me and not me and a dozen other women holding a day together by the handles.

The east wall is not a wall, not the way stories love walls. It is a place where the city insists on itself. It separates us from where we would fall, and sometimes it wants to be the falling. The whitened seams looked like smiles waiting to go wrong. Apes clung in garlands along the upper brackets, and their old ones told them scandal stories to keep them from looking down. The scaffolds underneath were new and too eager; the planks had not had time to learn the weight of what they held. The plaster around the joints had gone floury. When I pressed it with my finger, it dented and stayed dented like a cheek that has been kissed by a bad aunt.

“Pull it,” I said, and the apes sang the pull song, deep and circular, the one that fetches things out of the river that are not yet sure if they want to be up. Men on the bank leaned their weight into belts and ropes and the great rib rose slowly, hissing where it dragged against rock and bone. Ori was up to his knees in the water and smiling in a way that made me want to tell him to sit on a chair with a cup of something warm and imagine the piece as if it were under a light.

“You like things that want to be frames,” I called to him, and he laughed, and then the laugh slipped off his face because something in the river coughed again, and a bundle of wires breathed and fell apart, and with it came a smell like pennies and peppermint and the sweet rot of candy under a bed. The apes on the scaffolds began to hum the other song, the one you sing when the city changes its mind.

Thrum’s voice found me without a horn, the way good voices do. “Mara. There is cracking at the third brace from the west. They will lock if we do not warm them now.”

“I cannot be everywhere,” I wanted to tell him, and then remembered I had promised at least to pretend. I climbed. My hands are not made for scaffolds. They are made for trays and throats and the backs of chairs. The slats were slick with the oil the apes use when they want to be kind to wood. I consoled myself with the thought that all kindnesses make things more difficult in some way. At the third brace, the chalk had already begun its small rebellion. The line along the wood had been rubbed with pink the way people rub their cheeks in a mirror to believe in circulation. I took the field bottle from my bag and warmed the solvent in my palm. The bottle pretended heat existed and then made it true. I dribbled it over the seam and coaxed it to softness with my thumb. It yielded with a sigh, and the sigh was not wood, not rope, not anything anyone living had made. Beneath, the bracket wanted to turn, and I told it no, and it listened because sometimes that works.

“What have they done to my city,” an old ape muttered next to me. He was white around the chin and smelled like oranges that had never been oranges. “What have they named it without asking.”

“We named it ourselves when we came out,” I said, because picking fights with grief is how I make friends. The old ape snorted and then hummed, his bass in the hinge of the wall.

When the trellis crested the bank, the whole world groaned. The metal bore a number that was awkward to look at, a string of digits that wanted to stand in a row like soldiers. We lifted it at its edges and held it like a bed. The apes took corners and we moved as a group with lunges and careful violence to where the beams wanted a shirt. We wrapped it tight with belts and straps. Ori climbed on the piece itself, delighted, the way a child sits on a dog and thinks the dog is a ship. Under his palm, the trellis looked pleased to be asked to do something that was not its former job.

The city shivered with amusement. It loves it when we use something as something else. It loves our inventions like ribbons.

“Enough,” Thrum said, when the belts were singing. “If you pull more, it will think you tug because you want to test it, and it will test you back.”

We stood and let our joints speak to us, which is to say we panted and looked out over the river and pretended not to notice the wrong blue of the sky. The water was not water. It was thread. It is always molded to look like itself. If I stare long enough, I can forgive it the effort.

Then, without a bell, the Non-Day came in hard and without manners. It was not the slow hinge. It was a door flung open so that it banged the wall. The apes were frozen with their mouths in the shapes of words. A child on the bank had both his hands raised with the fingers spread as if counting, and the count never finished. My hands—the quiet hands—were quiet in the wrong way. They stopped at the exact wrong angle, solvent bottle suspended in the air. I saw the seam lines in the sky very clearly, the cross-hatching where the lid is scored for corners. A voice said a word that has no mouth, and something far away laughed like a person looking down at something under their chair. The color we call orange slid and became a lid of plastic with a promise of airtight printed on it in a script the city taught me to love and then took away.

When the day came back, it hurt. You don’t think days would be able to hurt you more than knives or names, but they do. The apes finished their words like embarrassed singers. The child shouted “seven!” as if he had been holding it all his life and thrust his fingers in the air as if I hadn’t been there to count them with him. My hand completed the gesture it had intended and a drop of solvent fell and hit my wrist and left a circle of cold like a coin. Thrum’s bellow was the last thing to restart, which meant his worry had been waiting for him when time allowed it.

“We don’t have time for this,” Ori said quietly beside me, as if time could be shamed into better behavior.

“We don’t have a choice,” I said, because someone always does and I didn’t want it to be him. “We will die in this joke, and the joke will be good and indifferent.”

“We will die busy,” he said, and smiled too hard for it to be true.

By noon, the trellis had made the east wall into a story we could tell without spitting. We left the belts where they lay, and the apes rubbing the connections with oil and pride. We ate bread that was drier than the word bread and drank water that remembered being a bottle. The boy with his arm came to the base of the scaffolding and watched me eat, as if I needed to be observed to keep from vanishing. He lifted his sling a little as if to show me that it wasn’t a trick. His mother had the look people wear when they know the person they love is an assignment from the city. I waved and made my mouth shape his name carefully without the horn. He glowed in relief the way children do when adults remember they are particular.

“Check your seams tonight,” I called down. “Warm the shoulder. Sleep on your back.”

He nodded solemnly and then ruined it by grinning like a spring.

Tamsin arrived breathless with a sack of gauze that was never as much as you thought it was going to be from looking at it. She had a streak of dust on her cheek and a ring of solvent on her sleeve and a splinter in her thumb she refused to acknowledge. “Cosmetics sent a boy to flirt with Ori,” she said to me, not bothering to lower her voice. Ori made a face that pretended he didn’t know what flirting was. “He had a pin on his hat with the picture of you on it. Collect them all.”

“Please let me never meet me,” I said. My stomach tried to climb out of my body with a little ladder made of worry. “If you see that paper again, don’t take it. Don’t let it take you.”

“I like a picture,” Tamsin said, with a woman’s honesty about wanting to own what scares her. “We’ll put it under the leg of a table and make it do something good.”

In the afternoon, Mal returned with the sash rewoven like someone had sat for hours and reminded himself that his hands were not only for holding onto other hands. He was carried by four young apes who had the look of people who had not yet been bored enough by the world to fear it properly. Thrum walked behind them like a planet refusing to affect tides. Mal’s eyes were brighter. Brighter is not always better. The corners of his mouth were clean. The bloom on his wrists had receded as if instructed. His chest clicked like a pocket watch held up to your ear.

“Doctor,” he whispered, and what came out after was not numbers, but the alphabet of another room. It was a series of clicks and whirs and small coughs that were tender but could not possibly have meant anything unless you had once sat in a yard made of asphalt and turned a block of plastic until a sticker peeled back to show you how to lock a hand into an arm. I hate and love that memory, which I do not have.

“Tell me where it hurts,” I said, in the idiot tongue of doctors everywhere.

He placed his palm on his sternum and tapped three times, fast. Then he hesitated and tapped once more, deliberate. It meant something to someone.

“Do you hear it,” Ori said in my ear, and I did. Under the radio hum, there was another voice. It was a small cheerful song like the ones they play in the alleys to sell soap that makes your hands smell like clean. It played the part where a catch is about to snap down. My fingers went cold. I warmed them on Mal’s flank the way you warm your hands over a kettle.

I opened him without opening him, the way you slice between seams so nothing has to confess to having been breached. The chalk had softened. He had been careful. I swabbed the inside of his larynx with the good solvent and it sparkled as if I had fed it sugar. I scraped a new bloom from the head of the femur, too new for this boy, too bright with its pride. Thrum stood with his hands wrapped around themselves like two boys fighting under a coat. Tamsin counted my breaths. Ori tapped a rhythm with his nail against the edge of the table that made the lamps hum in sympathy. When I touched the place Mal had tapped, I felt the wrong thrum. I pressed there as if we were in labor together, and something under my thumb clicked and then decided not to click anymore.

“He needs rafts,” I said, which was not news to anybody. “More than before. The sweet one. The new recipe.”

Thrum grimaced. “It makes the elders dream about the other place. They wake with the word in their mouths and can’t find what it belongs to.”

“Then they will dream,” I said, and it felt like I had chosen a meal for someone else and put it in their mouth.

When Mal had been closed up and patted and told the same lies we always tell at the end of a cut—that he was brave, that he was better, that he should rest when all he was is resting—Thrum did not move. He looked at the seams of the lamp, at the corners of the room where the dust gathers when it is tired of being in the air. “The figure with the wrong knees,” he said finally. “The one yesterday. He walked down the south stairs of the hill after he left the square and put his hand on a child’s head. The child has not stopped smiling.”

“Maybe he gave him a hat,” Tamsin said, because if you don’t say silly things, the true thing will come out too naked.

“He put his hand on the wall of the Registry and it left a mark,” Ori said, and held up his palm. On it was a copy of the mark I had seen under our door. ORI, scratched like a child’s first signature. “Not with chalk. With different. It sinks into the surface and then is the surface.”

“Don’t make it religious,” I said, because that is the other solvent: shrine. “We have enough altars. Give me another horn before you give me another saint.”

Thrum leaned his knuckles into the table and made it creak, which is an offense in my clinic and a useful sound in a war. “You will sit tonight,” he said. “You will say the things you say and the sky will listen and try not to. I will stand in the back and look like a wall. Vera will listen and pretend she isn’t. Ori will pretend to think and think. Tamsin will collect pins from the floor and curse me for walking with big feet. And then, when you are done, we will go under the stairs and you will tell me the real word for what the voice is. I will give you bread. You will take it and not eat it. We will pretend that makes us equals.”

“We will pretend,” I said. It felt good in my mouth. The city makes space for pretending because it knows how to do it itself.

Word had already run ahead of us by the time we reached the square. It always does. There were boys with pins in their hats and girls with ribbons on their wrists that matched no human fashion because they had been invented by apes who like loops. There were old women who always sit on the same step rubbing the same seam with oil that makes it smell like lemon candy. There were men who stood with their backs to the dais and looked at the sky because they are made to make trouble for themselves. There were apes in rows pretending to be bored. There was the figure with the wrong knees, not present and present in the exact way that makes you want to say his name three times and see if he appears. There was my own face in paper on a pole, and I wanted to strike it from the air the way you swat a gnat. The picture looked nothing like me and too much like me, which meant it would win.

I spoke into the horn because my choices are to speak or to allow others to do it for me. I said: the solvent is counted and counted again. I said: the east wall is wearing its shirt and you will respect it. I said: any child who brings a flower to paint over a seam will instead be given a loaf of bread and a piece of rope and taught to tie something that doesn’t show. I said: the cosmetics factories will put up their calendars and their recipes, and if they do not the apes will stand with their hands at their sides and look at their doors until the doors blush.

And then I did the thing I had told myself not to do, which is always the thing you end up doing. I held up the piece of paper with my picture on it because it was already in someone else’s hands and that makes it public. I bent it and wrinkled it and smoothed it again. I said: this is a picture of a person. It is not the person. Do not eat it. Do not kneel to it. Do not pin it to your hat unless you want to make Tamsin’s life difficult because she hates having to see my face when she is drinking. I made them laugh, and in the laugh there was a movement in the crowd like a very slow animal.

“It is nothing,” the lullaby Speaker murmured into his smaller horn, to soothe us, to soothe himself. “It is something,” the grinding wheel said, because he likes to be sincere when the air tastes like sugar. “It is both,” I said, because that is what truth is when you pick it up and look underneath.

Thrum’s escort had expanded itself without my permission. Lines of apes with their mouths barely open so that their teeth showed like beads flanked the aisle to the dais. A girl leaned into them to touch their fur and then pretended she had tripped. A boy tried to hold the gaze of one and lasted too long, then blushed and looked at his shoes. We are always looking at the wrong thing.

After the horn, after the applause that didn’t know whether to be relieved or hungry, after the hiss that felt like fresh air in some corners and malice in others, after we had, all of us, picked up our bodies and reminded them how to move, we went under the dais where the beams have names. Thrum handed me bread that I did not want and I tore it and put it in my mouth because refusing bread is drama I do not need. He looked at me as if the bread were a question. Ori stood at the low shelf, touching the scratches where someone had once counted days with a knife until they forgot what a day is and stopped.

“The word,” Thrum said, very quietly. “The one in the sky.”

“There isn’t one we can say without melting,” I said gently. “If I say hand, you will go home and your children will tell the walls a story and the walls will hear it. If I say gods, you will make ropes into laws and forget what they were for. If I say owners, you will tear the east wall down with your teeth so no one can own it. If I say makers, you will cry. If I say parents, you will turn to me like a child and I will not know what to do. If I say nothing, you will think I am keeping something from you. I can say this: we are placed. We are put. We are playing. We are played. And between those we do the washing and the stitches and the walking and the dropping of our hands when we are done.”

Thrum’s mouth twitched, which for him is a sob. He rested his forehead against the beam as if nodding to a king. He looked older because I had told him the truth and that is what truth does to faces that do not allow themselves to be young. “When it comes, when the voice comes down and makes us stop, sometimes I am relieved,” he said. “Because I am tired of being myself. Then I am ashamed of being relieved. Then I am angry. Then I am hungry. Then I forget and go about my day. I do not think animals are this complicated. I do not know if I want to be one. I do not know if I want to be not one.”

“We don’t have to choose,” Ori said, and let the beam have his weight, too. “The choosing was done and we got what we got. The interesting bit is what we do in the corner of the room when the large one looks away.”

Tamsin came in with her hands full of pins that had fallen out of the hair of the Assembly, which is to say half the city. She unloaded them into my palm because she knows I like to feel like a pincushion sometimes. “I found your name on the back of the dais,” she said lightly, as if names don’t cast shadows. “It was printed. MARA. Not written.” She made her mouth into the shape of my name like something you test before buying.

“I didn’t put it there,” I said. It made no difference. A printed name is a fact even if you do not agree to it.

We went back through the alleys to the clinic in the kind of quiet that is not silence, because silence is impossible in a city like ours. Someone was grinding powder in a bowl to lay along a seam as offering or medicine. Someone was laughing in the wrong place at the right time. A cart squeaked and bragged about its wheels. A boy ran, and running is always declaration and always apology. At the door, the scratch of our names looked newer as if someone had cleaned the dust around it to make it shine. Under the list of us, someone had added a letter that had no place. It was a letter from a language none of us owned. It looked like an animal that had been drawn with a ruler.

There was a smell of citrus in the stairwell. The cosmetics boy had left a box at the foot of the steps and the box made me nervous because boxes are not furniture here; they are architecture. I opened it with a knife that is made for softer things. Inside, roped in neat loops, were mirrors. They were the wrong kind. They showed your face and then for a second showed something else, and then were mirrors again. They had been polished with solvent and belief. On top, a card. On the card, a picture of me. On the picture of me, a sticker that said FRIEND OF THE CITY.

I put the card in the stove and lit it. The flame went up hungrily and then stopped, as if it had remembered it had manners. The paper refused to curl. The picture browned in a way you could forgive. The word melted and ran and then rearranged itself. It said: model. It said: collect. It said nothing and then only smoke.

“You cannot burn yourself,” Ori said from behind me, not unkindly. “That is, I believe, a law.”

“It is a guideline,” I said, and pressed the card down with the point of the knife until it gave up and became ash. The ash clung to the edge of the blade and refused to fall, as if it wanted a ride.

The boy with the arm came while the ash was still in the air. He sat down on the stool without being told, as if he had muscles that knew rooms. He held his shoulder still with the kind of carefulness that breaks a person later if you do not teach them how to stop. I warmed my hands on a mug of water and put them on him until the seam agreed that we were not enemies. I felt the roundness sit again in the cup as if it were meant and not a trick. He did not grin this time, not because he wasn’t happy, but because he had learned that grinning made adults think everything was fine.

“My mother says you will be in the Chair,” he said soberly, as if he had just been given a new word and wanted to see how it sat on his tongue. “She says that means you are the one who tells the bottles where to go.”

“I tell them stories,” I said. “They go where they will.”

“Will you tell my father where to go,” he asked, too honest, and then looked down as if the floor were about to open and accept him and he needed to prepare to meet it.

“I cannot tell fathers,” I said, and then softer: “I can tell him his son is brave. I can show him where to put his hands when he holds you so he does not hurt you. I can give him rafts that taste like sugar for your throat. I can tell him everything that frightens me if you promise to pretend to be asleep when I do.”

“I will fall asleep,” he said. “I always do.” He hopped off the stool and saluted me with the practiced silliness of someone who has witnessed a great many apes and men saluting yesterday and has decided it is a game he can win.

After he had gone—after the day had decided to stop and then remembered it was not yet allowed; after Thrum sent me a note that said: Remember to sit, as if sitting could be forgotten; after Ori drew a picture of the east wall with different belts in different colors and put it in a place where I would trip on it—after all that, I went upstairs and sat on my bed and put my feet on the floor and listened to the city hum through my soles.

I took out the instructions and put them on my knees. They showed me how to be. They showed me how to turn my arm until it clicked into place. They showed me how to tilt my head so that when the non-day came I would be at the right angle to please someone. They showed me how to pin my hair so the pins didn’t hurt. They showed me a picture of the Chair and an arrow that pointed to a lever that did not exist in ours. They showed me the figure with the wrong knees holding his hand out to me. They showed me a box with a window and my face behind the plastic, smiling with my many clean hands.

I folded the paper the wrong way, so that it didn’t want to fold. I folded it until the picture crumpled and the instructions were broken and the arrows didn’t point where they were supposed to. Then I unfolded it, and it remembered what it had been taught, and lay down in the shape it had been made to be. I put it back under the drawer.

The kettle clicked in the kitchen. I let it click again and again until the sound made a rhythm and the rhythm made a promise and the promise made a song, and I sang with it, quietly, because I am a doctor and we only sing under our breath, and because I was about to go and sit in a Chair and say words into a horn and pretend they were mine, and because the sky was going to open its mouth and say no, and we were going to keep moving anyway.Chapter 6

By the time the light leaned into evening, I had already spent my body twice over—once on the wall, once on the talk—and there was still the Chair. It sat on its pallet like a creature that wanted feeding, its arms polished by hands that wanted to be close to decisions without making them. The horn waited to be held in the way you grip something that will become your throat if you let it. Thrum stood at the edge of the dais with his shoulders widened as if he could be a door. Tamsin tightened the barrettes in my hair with the severity she uses on stitches. Ori balanced on the rail and pretended the drop was his idea.

The first thing you learn about the Chair is that it is not furniture. It is a verb. When I put my weight into it, a noise rose from the square like a low tide turning rocks, and the horn settled into my lap and stared at me as if it had just remembered a scandal. The Speakers did their little rituals to make the day behave: the grinding wheel knocked three times, the lullaby made a circle with his hand, the nails-in-a-box cleared his throat like a man looking for a moral. I bent toward the mouth of the horn and felt the city move a little closer on its elbows.

I said the lists again, because repetition is a kind of architecture when other structures fail. The solvents first to clinics, the bridges named and warmed, the east wall respected as a patient, the paint given places to decorate that did not ask to be hidden. I reminded them that we are allowed to be frightened without becoming a liturgy. I asked the apes not to braid their fur over the seams out of shame, but if they wanted to be pretty, to braid it for prettiness, which is a separate religion. I told the factories that we would stand at their doors and not move if they lied. I told the boys with the pins on their hats that if they put my picture on their heads, they must promise to take them off when it rained so they could feel the weather on their scalps and remember they were animals.

A runner climbed the dais steps with the wild carefulness of someone whose knees did not trust the message in his hands. His chest heaved and then forgot that breathing was a loop. He put his mouth too close to my ear and said, “South wing has slipped. Stonemason says history fell out of its bracket. The shelves are—” He stopped himself, as if he had bitten his tongue on the word. “The history is on the floor.”

There are times to finish speeches and there are times to leave people with their mouths open. I stood without saying the last part I had told myself I would say, and my not-saying became its own sentence, which is a risk. The apes nearest the dais leaned back to let me pass and leaned forward again to smell the room I left. Thrum moved before I did because he knows that if you are the first piece on the board, the others will fall into lines whether they wanted to or not. Ori dropped from his rail like a cat that has remembered it is something else. Tamsin was already counting gauze in her head, which is the only arithmetic I respect.

The south wing had never been my favorite subject. It is where the city keeps its arguments about itself. The stonemason with the clean fingers had set his geography into the walls so that the room tells you what it refuses to be and dares you to call it by those names anyway. When we arrived, the floor was a map of the past in shards, the pictures of amphitheaters and rope bridges sprawled and overlapped like a child’s game gone too true. The beautiful pieces had edges we did not expect. The seams under the images had bloomed, chalk exploding from the places where time had been made into a plate.

“I told him,” Ori said, crouching to put his palm against a cracked amphitheater and listening as if it had an accent. “I told him it was placed. He wanted built. He got dropped.”

The stonemason stood in the corner looking like a man who had expected to be arrested and found instead that he had been invited to a party. He lifted his hands and let them fall because he had nothing to carry anymore. “The wall was bored,” he said hoarsely. “It wanted to do it again. I made it too proud. My fault.”

“It was tired,” I said, because cause comforts a person in the same way confession does. “Help me lift the heavy parts as if they can remember their weight if we act as if we do.”

People think doctors only put things inside bodies back where they belong. You spend just as much time putting pieces of a day where they will hold. We slid slabs back into place and pressed them along their chalk edges with warm cloths so that the bloom softened, and the images grudgingly acknowledged they had once meant something. Tamsin made a paste from a good solvent and the chalk we scraped so it would think we wanted it and not despise the glue. Thrum bent at the waist and gripped a corner like a man shaking the hand of an enemy he needs not to hate. When he straightened, a rattle fell from his sash and danced across the floor with a cheerful sound like a child in church. He pinned it back with a grunt that was more embarrassed than angry.

The Non-Day hit us mid-lift and took the breath out of the room again. It came sharp, with the rudeness of a door kicked. We froze with our hands in what felt like the wrong positions: my palm halfway to a seam, Ori’s fingers splayed as if he were playing the piano he pretends not to miss, Tamsin’s mouth open around a pin that had waited its whole life to be swallowed, Thrum with his forehead bent to the edge of a stone as if praying to it. The ceiling turned into a grid you could taste. The orange wasn’t a sun but a sticker peeling in the corner, leaving behind the sweet blankness of adhesive. A voice said the name of a person named instructions with a bored affection that made me want to spit, and then whatever owns the afternoon put it back on like a coat and pretended nothing had happened.

We exhaled in that untidy way people do when they remember they have lungs. The stonemason made a noise I will call a laugh because I don’t have a better word for what he did when his soul came back at an angle. Outside in the hall a child shouted, and I wanted to go see that the shout was not a break. Instead, I pressed my thumb into the bloom until the chalk creaked like a stubborn secret, and the picture of the amphitheater settled into place with the sound of something taking up its old argument.

“You will not win this one,” Ori told the wall, which is also a thing he says to me sometimes when I make a choice he likes too much. “But you will be interesting until you lose.”

We worked until the sweat had made me remember where my edges were. People came and went with jars of water and stories about the part of the city their body had had to carry. The stonemason stopped apologizing and started naming what he was holding as if the words would keep it from slipping out of his hands again. Thrum’s voice turned soft when he spoke to the slab as if he were putting a boy to bed. Tamsin smudged the paste along a seam and wiped her fingers on the apron she swears she hates. The room acquired that humming quiet that work makes when it is the only god allowed.

Then the paper began to fall.

At first we thought it was dust, and it was. Dust makes you honest about your breath. Then a flatness was in it, and the flatness had edges, and the edges were corners that turned as they fell and flashed messages at us that were words if you had ever loved a box. The pages drifted like snow from the upper dark where the ceiling pretends sky. They made the room a rumor. They collected on our heads and shoulders and arms and stuck to the paste and the chalk, and some of them landed printed side up.

Tamsin caught one on her palm and did not move. Ori plucked another out of the air and did not blink. Thrum simply let them touch him and did not look down because he knows when to ignore the miracle so the others won’t teach it to scare them. I pressed one lightly with the back of my hand because the front of my hand is for other things. It stuck to my skin, and when I peeled it away it left a perfume of sugar on me that wanted to be believed.

The page had my face on it, but not the way faces are owned by faces. It was a drawing that pretended to be a photograph that had been polished until the skin did not know how to be skin. The figure on the paper held a horn in one hand and a knife in the other and smiled as if she liked to be held in a flat way. The words around her were too cheerful. They said: Curious City Playset: Clinic and Assembly, with Authentic Doctor Mara. They said: Squeeze Chair To Hear Real Speeches. They said: Contains Solvent (Not For Drinking). They said: Adult Assembly Required. They said: Not For Apes Under Three. They said: Warning: Small Parts May Become Your Life.

“Give me that,” I said low, and then softer because anger is a tool and not a meal. “No. Keep it. We can’t burn every proof.”

Tamsin had a different sheet. It showed a fold-out square labeled East Wall Shirt with dotted lines and a little pair of scissors printed in the corner as if the world could be cut to fit. It had arrows that explained the straps as if the belts would cooperate because a diagram asked them to. It had the number from Thrum’s charm printed in the bottom right, as if that made it more real. She rubbed her thumb over the number until the paper complained. “Why did they give us the instructions,” she asked no one, which is the only one to ask.

“Because we keep doing it without them,” Ori said, and he sounded pleased. “Because we invented the shirt while they were looking the other way and they want the credit to look natural. Because they love a child who builds without reading and hate that they love him.”

Thrum held a page at last. He looked at the figure with the wrong knees printed in a corner pointing his wrong hand at a wrong lever. He looked at me. He looked at the slab. He put the page under his foot and pressed it into the dust as if he could make it into the floor. “Pick them up,” he said finally, and his voice wanted to tremble but did not. “All of them. We will put them in a box and pretend we do not have a word for what that is. We will keep them where the city keeps food for days when there is no work to make food with.”

We gathered the pages with the kind of briskness you use when you want your hands to convince your head to move on. Children came in and tried to help, which meant they read aloud the bits that shouldn’t be said and laughed where I wanted to cry. A gibbon pressed his little palm to a picture of a string and showed his father where to tie the knot even though he already knew. A woman who had lost her hip last year and learned to walk with a stubbornness that made other people look away folded a page into a hat and set it on her head and dared anyone to smile. The pages made a sound when they rubbed together like whispers that have too many teeth.

When the room was itself again, we stood amid the salvage and let our backs talk to us. The stonemason cried in a way that kept his chest steady and his throat free and looked at what was left of his argument with time as if he might take the other side tomorrow. We had chalk on our faces and paste on our knuckles and the sugar smell made the nose want to surrender. I did not sit down in the Chair that evening. I said what needed saying with my mouth at normal size. The horn felt snubbed and sulked in the corner. The apes came and held up their babies to let them see us not be statues, and the babies drooled in relief.

We slept badly. In the dark the city’s hum sounded like a breath trying to be somebody else. Tamsin’s braid came apart and laid on her cheek like a friendly rope. Ori lay on the floor because he says he trusts a floor more if he watches it all night. Thrum did not stay. He never stays because he believes that if he is not among his soldiers they will turn into something else with teeth the wrong shape. He left behind one of his signals, a token that said I am here without the hazard of a body, and the token was plastic and had a number and I wanted to bite it until it broke.

In the morning a line had formed at the clinic door before the light had made up its mind. Everyone had something that could be named bloom or fear, and both are treatable if you catch them. We warmed seams with the kinder solvents and let the wrong chalks be ground into the right paste. We sent children to fetch water and forbade them to bring back any paper they found without showing it to Tamsin first, who had made herself the librarian of instructions and held the job like a person who has never been given a better title. We passed rafts to throats that didn’t want them and promised that the dreams would be merely dreams, and we lied and were a little right.

Around midmorning a man I had never met brought in a bundle wrapped in cloth that had been ripped from a banner. He kept the bundle away from his body as if it had a heat of its own and he didn’t want to be unmade by it. He placed it on my table and took off the cloth with a ceremony that would have suited a queen. Inside was a drum. It was the good solvent, the kind that makes the inside of your skull remember a song unless you hum something else at it. The seal was intact. The number matched the charm Thrum wore. The man met my eye and didn’t blink, which is how you tell a person is telling you the truth even if the truth is not what you asked for.

“From the depots,” he said, and his hands didn’t shake because he had let his feet do that job on the way over. “A gift. A bribe. A warning. Vera says she has friends among the stacks who like you better than they like counting. She says you will say she is doing this with her own heart and not because she does not want apes at her door. She says she wants to like you. She says if you say no she will like you harder.”

“I will say yes and build a fence with it,” I said, and wrote his name on his wrist with a pen so that later when Thrum asked where I had found a drum that tasted like a memory, I could point at a person and not a miracle. I pried the seal with the tip of an EEL & CO. blade that had decided it was proud of opening containers, and the smell came up like a choir. It made the room feel taller and the ceiling gracefully close. Tamsin stood a little straighter and then felt foolish and slouched on purpose. Ori grinned with a sin he refused to confess and tapped the drum with his nail to hear its hollow admit it was full.

That afternoon we were asked to go under the river. It is not a polite request even when it is spoken as one. The runners came with their hats off and their names in their mouths and said the depots had a hinge that had gone wrong, and if the hinge stuck, the path to the stacks would stay shut until the next time the sky was kind. They said that the last time that happened, the kitchens ran their pans dry trying to make water into stew. They said: we would send boys who like to prove their names with their skin, but the hinge has a seam that bleeds if you insult it, and you have hands that ask instead of take. Thrum sent two apes with shoulders like decisions to carry what we couldn’t and to watch what we would not.

Under the river is not below. It is beside. The stairs are too evenly spaced. The air is the temperature of a hand that thinks it is not touching you. The walls have a sheen that is not wet and not clean and smells like pennies and peppermint and the word I am not saying. We descended where the pipes turn their necks and follow their own rules. Ori had chalk in his pocket and drew little lie-lines on the wall where I could put my hand and pretend they were not fingerprints. Tamsin hummed very quietly so that the hum inside the walls had an argument and we could be a vote in it. The apes went ahead of us and behind us and made a cradle with their presence that made me understand how some people find god at the edge of other bodies.

The hinge was exactly where everyone had said it would be and none of the places on the diagrams. It was a circle of metal around a mouth in the floor that was too clean, a ring scribed with numbers that had already appeared in my sleep. The ring had chalk bloom like a ruff, delicate and prideful, and the mouth had a lid that pretended to be one piece and was many. The path below was not dark. It was indifferent to the idea of light. We stood around it and whispered because our mouths had learned to do it here.

“The last time I was under,” Ori said very softly, as if sense could be stolen by noise, “I brought up little boxes the size of brains. They had mirrors in their bellies that made a person remember being someone else. I threw one on the stones and it did not break. I have forgiven it.”

Tamsin put her fingers on the chalk and exhaled in the way that makes her lungs look present in her ribs. The chalk softened and let her rub it into something that wanted to seal instead of crack. The ring warmed. The lid sighed and remembered being obedient. I pressed my palm to the numbers and told them a story about a city where the hinges opened because people were kind, and the lid rolled back and showed us its throat.

The depots are rooms that dreamed of being warehouses and were given their wish in the worst way. Lines of boxes sat in perfect rows printed with perfect promises. The boxes made me feel ill with their politeness. They had my name in some of the corners now, which meant someone had been busy with a brush of authority. They had pictures of apes sitting on rails that looked like toy rails, and little pamphlets tucked into slits that said: Never Stand Here, which made me want to stand there and felt like a dare designed for us. The apes on either side of us made the noise in their throats that means we are not sure whether this is food, and I put my hand on the nearest shoulder and said don’t, which is not a word for apes and is understood anyway.

We rolled drums until our arms ached and our knees pleaded to be consulted. We filled packs with packeted rafts and small bottles that said things like hair on them and understood our theft better than their labeling did. Ori climbed on a low shelf to look for the number he refuses to admit he has been collecting, and when he found it, he drew a circle around it with chalk and told it he would bring it something nice if it behaved. Tamsin found a crate of mirrors that showed yourself and then a softer self for a second and then yourself again, and I told her if she tried to take one I would make her hold it in her lap until it told her a story she didn’t want. She laughed and did not put her hand on it.

The Non-Day took us with our arms full. It came slowly this time, as if embarrassed by earlier rudeness, a dimming of the air like a person who regrets having shouted and now wants to talk. The mirrors on the shelves reflected a lid that wasn’t ours and then decided not to, and the boxes flexed and forgot their corners. I felt myself freeze with the muscles in the position that makes hands look like they have just done something terrible. A shadow bent over us from the somewhere above the somewhere above, and for a moment I was certain a face had peered in with eyes that did not belong to sight. It was not a god. It was a person. They were bored.

We resumed in a stagger, like people who had tripped together and pretended not to. The hinge sighed and considered shutting as if to teach us a lesson about gratitude. The apes pushed two drums over the threshold with a gentleness that would have suited a baby. Ori backed toward the mouth and would have fallen if Thrum’s soldier had not placed a palm between his shoulder blades the way you keep a child’s rocking chair from tipping. Tamsin swore with a precision that made the room feel polite again. We hauled the drums up and out and rolled the lid and made the chalk a collar again and tied a rope around the numbers as if you can keep arithmetic on a leash.

When we reached the stairs, the figure with the wrong knees was waiting. He stood in the middle of the third landing where the light decides to be flattering. He held a clipboard that had always existed in his hand. There was a sheet upon it and lines for names and spaces for numbers and a small cartoon of a woman with a knife and a horn that was meant to comfort by being round. He did not look at us exactly. He looked at the idea of us and reached through it as if the air would sign.

“Delivery receipt,” he said, and the horn in my head made his voice larger than his mouth. “Warranty void if used for children. Items not to be stored near heat, hope, or apes. Return within thirty days for full refund. Solvents may cause memory. Drums not to be rolled downhill. Do not speak into horns without permission. Do not make cities in basements. Do not give Names to things without submitting the forms. Do not—” He paused, as if someone in a distant room had spoken into his ear. “Do not pretend. Signature here.”

He held out a pen attached to the clipboard by a string that had never had knots. It was ridiculous. It was the most sincere threat I have ever seen. I took the pen because refusing would be a gesture for an audience I did not care to feed. I wrote my name on the line very carefully, each letter a separate animal. The pen left no ink. The line turned black on its own and then looked away as if embarrassed to have told the truth. The figure smiled the smile printed on the instructions and nodded once and vanished with the politeness of a thing returned to its packaging.

Ori put his hand on the place where he had been as if to feel the warmth of a man who wasn’t one. Tamsin checked the drums with the careful pettiness she uses on kings. The apes pressed close until they were an argument you could lean on. We climbed into the city with our arms aching and our eyes salt and the solvent making us honest whether we wanted it to or not. The square welcomed us with the greedy relief it gives to anyone bringing anything that can be poured.

We rolled the drums into the clinic and counted them and then counted them again because I like to be a person who can be bored by arithmetic. I put my hands on the metal and told it not to think it owned the room just because we wanted it. Tamsin took the first bottle to Mal, who had slept and woken with a word in his mouth that he could not spit out. She held his head and let four drops fall into his throat and pressed his larynx gently as if reminding it of what it is for. He looked at her like she was a story he did not know the ending to and swallowed obediently and made a face because sweetness is only pleasant when you are told it will be bitter.

That night, after the Chair had been sat in and the horn had been appeased and the Speakers had ground their voices down to the powder they use to fill their own seams, after the apes had made their nests in rafters with their babies tied to them like songs, after Vera had sent me a note that said: Ten percent is an insult that I will pretend to adore, after Thrum had looked at me with a relief that made me hate and love him for trusting me with his weakness, I went upstairs and found a package on my bed.

It was small and square and wrapped in paper that was too clean and had a picture of a bow printed on the top as if your hands could be spared. The paper said: For The Doctor. The paper said: Promotion Inside. The paper said: Collect Them All. I stood and looked at it for a long minute that was not a minute. I put my hands behind my back because I am a coward in the ways that save lives. I sat down on the bed and let my feet find the floor with their old faith. I did not open it. I would not open it. I wanted to open it more than I have ever wanted to open anything.

I boiled the kettle instead and watched the steam lie to me until I believed it. Tamsin came in without knocking and shut the door as if the room had breath that needed keeping. She held out her hand and I dropped three pins into it because our rituals soothe me. Ori leaned in the doorway and put his shoulder against the jamb like a man trying to stop something that wasn’t coming. Thrum’s signal on my table looked at me with its number and its plasticity and said nothing, and I forgave it this once for having been worn where a heart would be.

“We can put it in the river,” Tamsin said, nodding at the package. “We can let the thread carry it into the mouth and watch the mouth decide it is a kind of bread and spit it up for the fishermen in five days. We can give them a toy. We can prove that we do not give only medicine.”

“We can leave it on the Chair,” Ori said, and grinned the way a person grins when he wants to get punched and hugged in the same moment. “Let it sit there and teach the horn to be quiet. Let the city see that we have offerings too. Let the sky see it’s not the only one who can wrap a thing and call it love.”

“We can ask Mal,” I said, because I wanted to ask someone who would not have the right words. “We can put it in his hands and watch what he does. He is the person we keep saving as if the saving will add up to a law. If he opens it, we will know. If he doesn’t, we will teach ourselves a patience.”

We did not sleep well. The Non-Day did not come. The Not-Non-Day came instead, which is worse in some ways because you keep your habits and none of your excuses. The city lay on its back and tried to be good, and we did the same, and neither of us succeeded. In the morning, the package was still on my bed, and my name was in more mouths than bread.

Mal arrived before the horn for midmorning had time to declare itself. He walked. The walking was a little wrong and better than not walking. He held his sash, which had acquired two charms of printed numbers that someone had tied there with a seriousness that could feed a family. Thrum did not come with him. That felt like faith. It felt like a test. It felt like a general finally knowing that the city has more hands than his. Mal sat, not on a cot, but on the floor in the corner where the light pretends to be softer, and he tapped his sternum three times and then once because that was our conversation now.

“I have a gift,” I said, and hated the word as I said it. “For you. For me. For us. For the place in us that wants to know what it is not our business to know.”

He put out his hand without hesitating. I carried the box to him with my fingertips under it as if it could poison skin. He took it and put it in his lap and ran his palm along its clean edges in a way that made me forgive him his beauty. He looked at me once and then did not look at me again, which is the most polite way to take a thing apart. He peeled the printed bow off as if it were the face of someone he had promised not to love. He folded the paper as if it had asked to be treated well and put it aside. He opened the box with a movement that suggested that instructions were a language he would always be fluent in.

Inside was not a toy. It was not a model. It was not a picture. It was a label. It was a flat, flexible sheet with words written in a script I could read and could not. It had a squiggle that had been my signature yesterday in the stairwell and next to it in smaller letters a phrase that meant nothing and everything. It said: Owner’s Copy. It said: Thank You For Your Purchase. It said: Warranty Valid Only With Proper Use. It said: Doctor Included. It said: Do Not Wash. It said: Sugar Flammable. It said: Keep Out Of Reach Of Names. It said: If Broken, Please Return To— and then the line where the place name should have been was blank and tasted like metal on my tongue.

Mal looked up at me with his sly child’s seriousness. He held the label between his thumb and forefinger. He made a decision that will follow us for longer than our bones will. He folded the sheet into a shape that might have been a bird in a different world and placed it in my palm as if it had been mine since we counted ourselves. He tapped his chest. He tapped the floor. He tapped my hand.

“You may have it,” he said, in his careful wrong right voice, and the numbers in the corner of the room vibrated like a string plucked. “But do not call it by its name.”

I put the folded label in the drawer under the drawer where the instructions slept in their papery guilt. I shut the drawer and then put a bowl on top of the cabinet and then a book on top of the bowl and then a statue of a gibbon that someone had carved from a soft stone and given to us the night Avery’s head made the sound I will never be able to forget. I felt the ridiculousness of myself and did not stop. Tamsin, to her credit, did not laugh. Ori, to his credit, did.

That afternoon, someone painted over the seam on the clinic wall not with flowers but with small plain letters that said: we are made and we make. The paint was a dull blue that had decided not to be pretty. The letters were not practiced. They dragged a little where a hand had not yet learned the shape. It made me feel something that I can call hope because it was small and a little ugly and insisted on being kept.

When dusk came, the Chair was there and the horn was there and the square was there with its mouths and its eyes and its arms, and I sat and I spoke and I did not look up. I said the things we would do and the things we would not, and I told them that a package had arrived in my bed and that I had not opened it alone, and the laugh came in the right place this time and did not taste like pennies. I said we will stand at the hinge in pairs. I said the depots are not churches. I said the paints are recipes now. I said Mal walks and taps when he hurts and you can learn his language and keep that one thing from me. I said we will not give the Non-Day a new name to make it love us. I said stop sanding down your knuckles to make yourselves more like the pictures because the pictures will only change to follow you. I said we will count the water and count the meat and count the rafts and count the bridges and count the children and count the names we refuse to speak and call that counting living.

When the sky leaned down to be a parent again, I did not stop. I kept speaking, as if my voice could make the freeze less total, and for a heartbeat that was not a heartbeat some part of the city heard me and moved its eyes under the lid while the rest of it held its pose. Then it obeyed its old rules and became a picture of itself again and waited for permission to resume. When it let me go, my mouth hurt from forcing sound through stillness and I could not stop laughing for a breath or two, which is a small cruelty to anyone who has ever seen a woman break.

After, under the dais, Thrum tore the bread in large unreasonable pieces and handed them to people’s hands until they were not soldiers but mouths. Vera stood with her coat unbuttoned and let the air see her seam as if it were a decoration. The stonemason told a lie about having fixed the wall by himself and left out our names, and I loved him a little for giving the city a story it could carry without us if we fell. Ori scratched his name where he should not and then scratched it out and then scratched it again, which is how he prays. Tamsin picked up the pins, which is how she gets forgiveness.

I went home to the clinic and stood in the door and looked at the scratch of our names and the extra letter someone had added like a dare and put my finger on each groove. The door remembered me. The room allowed me. The kettle clicked. I put water on the stove and folded the label-bird again without looking at it and tucked it under a different drawer. The lamps hummed. The apes outside argued with sleep and lost. The city made the small satisfied noise it makes when it thinks it has been good. Above us the voice turned in its bedding, and the plastic of our sky creaked, and someone in a room beyond our weather said: Tomorrow. And someone else said: Again. And we made ourselves ready to mean it.Chapter 8

By the fourth morning of being a person whose name had learned to walk without me, the city had started to carry itself with a new kind of caution, like a patient who has been told to get out of bed and is not yet convinced the floor is still the floor. The apes on the rails were quieter; quiet for apes is not quiet, it is focus. The women at the buckets did not gossip so much as conduct water. The lamps hummed as if they had tuned themselves to a better neighbor. I drank hot water because I do not like the lie tea tells my mouth and because the kettle and I had made a peace that tasted like honesty. On the clinic door, along our scratched names, someone had added a line in little deliberate letters: we will not be returned. The paint was cheap. I loved it.

We had more solvent than we should and less calm than we needed. The drum from the depots sat against the wall and made the whole room feel like a throat about to clear. Tamsin had organized our new heresies into boxes labeled with verbs instead of inventories—warm, soften, seal, pretend—and she guarded them with the violence of a librarian. Ori had charcoaled a crude map of the under-river hinge on the back of a paper that had once wanted to be a notice of compliance and was now a child’s handprint in black. Thrum came in the side door without knocking not because he was rude but because he is a door and knows how to be one.

“Hark is awake,” he said without ornaments, and looked like a problem we had all had a hand in making and none of us had the right tools to fix. “He asked me to tell you that he will die any way you choose, Doctor, if you make it interesting.”

“It is a bad morning for poetry,” I said. The kettle clicked because I had forgotten to put water under it. “What does he want.”

“To climb,” Thrum said, and a tremor went through the room like a shiver down a great back. “He says: if this is a lid, I will put my head through it. He says: a rope is a way to tell the sky about yourself. He thinks walls understand the language of weight. The old ones hum. The young ones watch his mouth and forget their food.”

“Tell him the east wall is wearing its shirt and we must not tug at it for fashion,” I said, and my mouth made a smile that was not meant for me. “Tell him the shirt has seams that do not prefer pride.”

“I told him,” Thrum said, and plucked at his sash the way a man fiddles with a medal to stop himself from hitting someone. “He said you will bless the climb or you will not, and either way he will be king.”

The word king is a toy we still haven’t broken ourselves of putting in our mouths. It tastes salt and sweet and makes your teeth feel like strangers. I looked at the drum; the drum looked at me. “I want to tell him no and then stand under the wall and catch the boys when they fall,” I said. “There is not enough of anyone for that.”

“We will build a ladder and call it a bridge and the day will forgive us,” Ori said from the doorway, hands gray with chalk in a way that made him look pleased and caught. He came to stand with us in the place between the table and the drum where decisions like to go to be counted. “We can make the shirt into sleeves. We can wrap it in places and make the wall hold us without knowing we are held.”

“Sleep on it,” Tamsin said, too brisk to be anything but kind. “You’re tall, not holy.”

Thrum huffed, a sound like a stone shoved into a pocket. “He wanted to speak to you himself. He has sent a runner named Korr—big hands, mouth like a rake—to fetch you. He thinks being brought makes people behave like parcels. Don’t let him teach you how to be carried.”

“I won’t be carried,” I said, and then the bell in the square struck a note that wasn’t ours. It wasn’t our bell. It was the sound a spoon makes on a pitcher in a kitchen where the floor is always clean. The lamps shook themselves and then it came: a voice from everywhere and nowhere that did not belong to any of us. It was smaller than the one that calls the Non-Day, and that made it worse. It had the smile printed on instructions tucked into it. It said, cheerfully: Product Advisory.

Everyone in the clinic stopped like a hand had reached under the table and pinched the long muscle that runs along the thigh where you can’t ignore it. The voice continued in the comfortable cadence of a person who has never cleaned blood out of anything. It said: All units operating in Zone 41, observe. It said: A recall is in effect for doctor model Quiet Hands (M. Quell series, batch 7–12). It said: Issues observed include unauthorized leadership, noncompliant solvent allocation, public speech, refusal to fold according to diagram, and excessive use of metaphors. It said: Please return affected unit for refurbishment and spirit refresh. It said: Warranty will be void after thirteen days. It said: Thank you for your compliance and keep building bright!

Silence can be loud enough to make plates walk off shelves. That silence stepped into our room with both boots. Tamsin spat a pin into her palm and closed her fingers around it as if she could render it into something useful. Ori held his smile like a lit match under his tongue and did not swallow. Thrum did not move for three full breaths. When he did, it was to take the drum by its rolling lip and drag it a hair farther from me, a body-language argument I understood and did not forgive him for.

“I am not portable,” I said, and my voice did not make me proud. “I am not an appliance. I do not refurbish. I do not go anywhere I do not go.”

“You go where you point yourself,” Thrum said, low. “And sometimes where I point you. If anyone who is not of us points, we make them eat their fingers. Korr is waiting, and Hark is an old ape at his tallest. Come now. Ori will make our shirt into sleeves. Tamsin will label the drum ‘bread.’ I will walk outside in a long line of my own limbs and make young apes think I am the wall. We will not return anything. We will unlearn the word return.”

In the square, the sound that follows a rope being thrown wrong skated across a row of listening heads. The crowd was already murmuring, and murmurs are only dangerous when they agree. The small ones on shoulders had paper hats made out of the pages that fell yesterday. More than one had been folded to point in a direction none of us wanted to look. Korr was as Thrum had promised, a creature built to carry, his hands like two helpful tragedies. He bowed to me in a way that made me forgive him for believing that bows and ropes do the same work. We walked through the market under banners that had pictures of my face with a stamp across them that said FRIEND and someone had penciled a careful little NOT in between the R and the I.

Hark’s hall is a theater of a kind, the kind where your seat tells you who you are before your mouth does. He lay on a dais that had been a pallet and then had learned to pretend. He had a throat like a bell and hair like a crown and the appetite of a man who knows the sweets will make him ill and wants them anyway. The old ones sat on the steps with their spines like staffs and their ankles a church of angles. The young ones watched him like a weather report.

“Doctor,” Hark said, and when he says your name it means you are a tool and a guest and a theory. “You look small enough to fit in a box and tall enough to stand behind a horn. Which are you.”

“Both and neither,” I said, because I am tired of anyone making me choose. “Why call me.”

“When the voice told us which toys to put away, you looked like a girl and a knife,” he said, teeth polite as a row of eggs. “I want to do a thing that will be called stupid. I want to climb your lid. I want to feel it with my face and to put my hand through it as a threat and as love. The old ones say the last time we stacked ourselves to the sky, the voice left a finger on someone’s head and he still smiles. They say it is bad luck not to do things twice. Will you bless the climb. Thrum is soft in his ‘no.’ I want you to tell me a ‘no’ that feels like a seat.”

“I will bless the safety ropes,” I said, because you can bless the bowl and not the soup. “I will count belts and tie double knots. I will write Ori’s name on the braces so they behave. I will tell the young ones where to put their feet and make them say the names of their mothers before they go up. I will not stand beneath you. I will not pretend that waiting under a falling thing is a kind of faith. And when you get your face against the lid and learn only that it has a smell, I will be the one you do not forgive for being right.”

He laughed, a big old ridiculous sound that made half the room love him and the other half want to eat him and both those halves were the same one. “Good,” he said. “Good. I like a ‘no’ that knows its alphabet.” He clapped his hands and the chamber changed shape. A boy brought ropes that had learned to behave. A woman with hands like eyes brought belts and knew who wanted to be tied and who wanted to do the tying. We went to the east wall with an army that had nothing to do with war and everything to do with the way a body learns itself when it believes it is about to do something very stupid very well.

The shirt held its pride the way a patient holds in a laugh when you scold them gently. Ori clambered over the trellis and rubbed ash into places he wanted to feel older. Tamsin carried pins in her mouth and spat them where they would not be stepped on. The apes made no move to argue with the wall; they courted it. They put palms to beams and said the words for please that make all of us grow in the right direction. A boy with his hair in a knot tested the first rung with his ankle. Hark tested it with his whole back.

“Breathe,” I said, to the wall and the apes and the horn in my own throat. “Breathe now, so that when the day is rude to us you don’t forget how.”

We had three rungs up the world when the Not-Day broke in on all fours. It came with the politeness of a chair pulled quietly out from under you. The boy on the first rung was suspended with his mouth half-open around a word like mother. Hark’s hand was in the air, far from the rope he had meant to grab. My hands were in their quiet wrongness again and the bottle in my pocket had decided to not be the shape of its own liquid. The sky made its tired sound for instruction and the light presented itself again as a lid with the other side’s numbers printed on it. They had added a line since yesterday: Do not attempt to access. They had drawn a smile next to it and called it a warning.

I have been at this long enough to know that fear makes time either soup or bone. I picked a bone. I told my eyes to keep being eyes. I told my mouth to keep being a mouth. The freeze was a story about obedience. I told myself that stories can be corrected mid-sentence. I moved, and I did not. I thought I felt my finger—just the tip of my left index—fill, like a river remembers that it was water before it was thread. The feeling was so little that it tasted like a lie. I touched the seam on my wrist with my mind and told it I was not asking permission this time. I pushed a breath through my teeth. The horn on the dais behind us echoed a sound that could have been a cough and came back to me as a command.

If a thing has rules, it can be broken. If a rule can be broken, it is already asking you to break it. My lip twitched. In that quarter-inch of victory, a drop of solvent in my pocket tilted and caught a glint from a lamp that had not stopped humming. It made me a promise. I became the kind of woman who believes promises from bottles. I could not move my hands, but my voice had learned something sitting with the horn. I spoke, and the word was not hand and not god and not parent. I said: breathe.

Around me, the apes’ mouths finished their vowels two heartbeats before the rest of them caught up. That little pull, that tiny preface, was a rip in the world. Then the Non-Day let us go and we fell forward into our bones—the boy onto the rope, Hark onto his second rung, Ori into a laugh that did not belong to him and he wore anyway. The wall, unhappy about being told what to do, creaked down its length in a way that made me hate the person I would someday have to be to forgive myself if it fell.

“Enough for today,” I said to Hark, and he understood because he is king mostly for knowing which ‘enough’ belongs to which shoulder. He bared his teeth at the sky as if it had insulted his oldest aunt. He came down with pride that remembered how to have fun. The young ones let out their breath in a cheer that turned into an argument with the sky you conduct using jokes. The old ones hummed the tune that teaches memory to sit. I sat because my legs had been holding me out of politeness and were tired of being better than they had agreed to be.

Back at the clinic, Korr brought a box with polite corners and a feeling of a trick about it. It was heavier than paper should be and lighter than truth. It bore the words: Return Authorization, and under that a line with my name and a blank for a signature and a series of numbers that were starting to look like someone’s birthday. Inside was a harness with straps meant to embrace shoulders that did not belong to an ape, and a coil of rope that told me in its friendly manufactured way that it had been asked to pull a load within a range of acceptable weights and would complain if your love exceeded them. Tamsin wrapped the harness around her hands and pulled until the fabric squeaked like a note in a throat.

“What happens if we send them something,” she asked, and the idea smiled at all three of us at once. “What happens if the Return receives a return that is not the thing it asked for.”

“We have stuffed a man before and called him king,” Ori said, thinking of ceremonies where the picture is what the people need and the body is tired. “We can make a doctor that sits and smiles and leaves smudges in the right places and says mm and yes and no and come tomorrow. The horn believes the sound more than the source. The sky believes labels more than faces.”

“You will not make an idol of me,” I said because saying it out loud is the only way to pretend you have a choice. “If you make a person out of cloth and shame and put my name on it, make sure it can also answer a child when he asks if he was chosen.”

“We will not be kind to it,” Tamsin said. “We will be precise.”

It turns out you can do a lot with gauze and rope and the knees from a figure you did not invite. Tamsin rigged a spine with dowels from crates that had once asked us not to store hope near heat. Ori shaped a rib cage from bent trellis offcuts that still smelled like river. I donated a coat. Not because it looked like mine on paper and I wanted to punish a paper, but because the sleeves knew how to teach a shoulder what kind of behavior was expected. We stuffed it with rags that had been our own patients’ names and with the sacks Vera used to send us powder when she wanted to pretend she wasn’t helping. We took a page with my picture and put it behind the mouth where no one could see it but the sky.

The Return was scheduled for the hour when the rumor runs fastest, which is when we meant to be in the square anyway telling people their fear did not count as a vote. We carried the box under the river instead, through the hinge that had decided to be polite if you talked to it like a dog. The apes came as our choir, two in front, two behind, walking with a careful cheer that said: we can carry a lie as well as anyone can carry a drum. The depots smelled cleaner because the word recall had done the room a favor by putting it in a mood. We set the box where the diagrams told us we would find someone to sign for it and took our hands away. The figure with the wrong knees appeared exactly where his knees were supposed to be. He had an assistant this time, a woman with a hat that had never seen dust and a pen tethered to her wrist by string as a favor to memory.

“Return,” she said, and her voice pretended we were all the same size. “Excellent. We’ve made improvements to the voice module and reined in metaphor usage for greater clarity and brand alignment. Please note the updated safety advisories regarding chairs and horns. Please initial here to indicate you have removed any personal attachments from the unit.”

Ori almost laughed himself into the river and then did not. Tamsin wrote a small letter in a place no one could say wasn’t a line. I had to fight the urge to draw a picture of a spoon.

The figure touched the harness inside the box with his wrong hand and nodded to a beat only he heard. He did not look at the face. It is possible faces are not part of his job. He did not smell the coat, which would have told him that it had learned too many rooms to be new. He lifted the box as if it were meant to be light and carried it not like a prize and not like prey, but like a thing that belonged to a shelf and was on its way to reacquaint itself. We watched him turn at the hinge with elegant carelessness, which is what passes for grace where he comes from. The woman clicked her pen against her clipboard and checked a box that said: Doctor retrieved. Purchase will be credited. She had the fraudulence to wink.

When we returned to the square, the Chair had been waiting with her arms crossed. The horn made a noise that I have started to call petulance. The Speakers made their rituals and listened to themselves for a bit and then pretended to listen to me. The apes arranged themselves in willingness, which is to say they left nobody out of the shape. Vera kept her coat closed because the seam on her jaw had darkened and she did not want to give anyone something to pretend not to be looking at. The stonemason had chalk on his cheeks like war and pride. Thrum stood with his hands behind his back so children could run under the bridge of his arms and say they had been brave later.

“I have no speech that will make you afraid less often,” I told them, because I will not be a peddler of sugar that never dissolves. “I have a long list and a short list and the two words I promised Thrum I would not use in the same sentence. The long list is work. The short list is not dying.”

We did the first things first because that is the only order that doesn’t make you sick. The solvents go here and here and here. The rafts go to throats that cannot remember swallowing. The east wall takes its shirt off before noon and wears it again when the sun is a character we do not like. The children who run too smart will be taught to tie knots where the straps do not rub the seam. The factories will show their calendars and their recipes and their books and if anyone catches them lying they will be fined not in coins but in hours of sitting in the clinic holding the hands of people who are learning to say, Yes, I know it is not blood, we have told that story, but it is something and it is mine.

I said: there has been a recall. Everyone knows by now because everyone knows things faster than I do unless they don’t. I said: we have returned a doctor. Everyone laughed and then stopped with the relief of recognizing something daring enough to be stupid. I said: if anyone else is asked to be returned, they should come to me first so I can draw a mustache on the paper that says so. The horn made my mustache bigger than it deserved to be. The children roared. The apes chuffed as if the word had a fur on it they liked.

The sky, perhaps feeling left out, decided it was its turn again. The Non-Day’s voice came down late and impatient. It took us with an offended clap. This time, we were ready. Not to move—move is a luxury. Ready to be rude. I spoke into the stillness with my mouth stubbornly open and said again: breathe. Somewhere in the square someone exhaled ahead of the freeze’s permission and the freeze faltered, insulted. It does not like to be preempted. It looked around the corners of itself for the one who had cheated and found only a woman at a horn with her lips not embarrassed by their work. It thought about making an example and then did not, which is how I know that whatever listens above us is not only a parent and not only a child.

We were let go. We were always let go. I will stop being grateful for the gone if the gone stops pretending to be mercy. After the horn, under the dais, Thrum did the thing he does when he is very proud and pretending he is not: he asked me a question too big for any room. “When the voice came down,” he said, and looked at Ori as if to borrow his brain and at Tamsin as if to borrow her judgement and at me as if to borrow the thing between, “did you move.”

“I told my mouth to keep my tongue from the story it wants to tell on its own,” I said. “I moved the tip of a finger the distance between a lie and a metaphor. It was nothing. It was everything.”

He nodded, the nod of a general who has run his hands along the edge of a blade and found it newly sharp. “Good. I will tell the boys that the doctor is a bad example.”

“Tell them I am an example of a thing they are not allowed to be until they are older,” I said, and realized I had used a parent voice on apes and did not apologize. “Tell them that if they try to breathe at the wrong time, the wall will make a sound it has been saving.”

The day that followed us home was not done with its tricks. In the clinic, when we were at last not in front of more mouths than hands, the bottle marked Sweet Rafts told me its secret by coming apart into its own idea. Sugar is flammable. We had painted those words on the wall as a joke and a reminder and a superstition. A drop ran where it should not have, along a seam where a lamp cord had forgotten it was a cord. The flame that jumped up was small and interested. It licked the painted letters and made them look briefly like they had decided to be true.

Tamsin smothered it with her apron which had never looked more like a sacrifice. Ori threw water at a careful angle so that the water did not remember being thread. The apes at the windows made the grateful noise people make when a child does not fall. The scorch looked like a flower if you were the kind of person who thought pain is pretty, which I am not. Under the smoke smudge, the paint blistered, and under the blister, the plaster had lines on it that I would have called writing if I had been drunk and I was not. It was the number again—the birthday of our wall, the license of our day, the charm Thrum wore near where a heart would be. Beside it, very small, as if someone’s pen had trembled with laughter or disobedience, a word had been written upside down. It said: void.

We are always a step behind the place that named us. The word burned my mouth without going in. Tamsin reached up and put her finger on it with a look of reverence that looked so ugly on her it was lovely. “We can void our own warranties,” she said, with the mischief of a woman who has untied every knot someone else thought was permanent. “We can refuse the promise that says if we break we must be returned.”

“What happens when we void,” Ori asked gently, because he is not just the creature he plays at and he cares about what breaks when you tell it it’s allowed to stop pretending.

“We ruin their guarantee,” I said, and surprised myself with feeling a thing I had had a word for all along. “We say: if we fail, it is our failure, and you cannot come take us and make us new in your image. We say: we will be old in front of each other, as a choice. We will bloom and call it a season. We will learn to sand the chalk into paste to glue each other where we have been told to accept replacement. We will risk being unpretty.”

Thrum came that night and did not take a chair because chairs make him look like a father and he hates it. He stood and watched while I did a foolish thing on purpose. I took the little EEL & CO. blade and pressed it into the seam at my wrist with a pressure that knew exactly what it was for. I did not cut the way you cut skin. There is no blood. I warmed the edge with solvent and let it sing. I pressed until the seam complained and then I took chalk and rubbed it into the complaint. The word void was not a shape I put on but a thought I let in. When I was done, I had a little pale place there like a blank stamp, and it hurt exactly enough to make me remember it. Tamsin watched me with the furious tenderness of someone who had decided to love a poor choice because it belonged to a friend. Ori watched with the appetite of a scientist and the restraint of a person who has learned restraint the hard way. Thrum looked away and then looked back, which is how you know he wants to follow where you went and is not sure his feet will like it.

He took his charm into his hand and rubbed the numbers with his thumb until they warmed. The plastic gave under his finger and then did not, which is a metaphor for most of the things we ask of the world. He pressed it to the seam of his own wrist—the seam that on apes is deeper and more proud and has hair at the edges like a little crown—and he held it there until the plastic creaked and had to admit a new fact. When he took it away, the number had left something behind that was not a bruise. It was a lack. It was a place where a stamp had refused to be legible. He smiled, which is to say that his mouth did nothing and everything changed.

In the morning the city had written void in places I could not claim. On the leg of the east wall where a boy had been taught to put his foot. On the underside of a bridge where apes sleep in loops like necklaces. On a cosmetic factory calendar, right through a day that had been counted for inventory. On a banner with my face on it in the market, right over my mouth. Vera came with a smirk that admitted admiration and grief. “The recall boys will come,” she said. “They do not like being cheated of their errands. The place behind the lid has clerks who need their tallies to tally. When they don’t, they come down and count with hands.”

“They can bring their hands,” I said, and my quiet hands were not quiet. “We will make them burn on our chalk. We will stand and be boring for as long as it takes for their pens to run out of their own ink.”

They came on the third day, as if out of courtesy or because they had three pages worth of permissions to fill and had to tear them along the perforations. The figure with the wrong knees brought two more and a woman with a rolling cart. They had clipboards and polite expressions and bags under their eyes as if time is kinder where they sleep and had been complicated for them lately. The square did not shout. It arranged itself into lines like an army of mules. The apes stood in fronts the way they do when they’re about to be what people call a wall and what I call a family. The humans folded their arms in the way that says you can’t measure the contents by the container. I stood on the dais and put my hand on the horn but did not bend. Silence is also a voice.

“Recall,” the woman said, in a voice that had a handful of sugar pinched into it to keep it soft. “We have authorization to retrieve malfunctioning units. We have a willing ratio. We have a satisfaction threshold. We have an upgrade. Please move aside.”

Thrum stepped forward like a door and said nothing. That nothing traveled through the bodies behind him like a wave that does not want to be named. Vera unclipped the throat of her coat and showed her seam without ceremony. The stonemason held his hands out, chalk up, an offertory of dirt. Tamsin smiled in the way that made me want to stand behind her, which is not how we arrange ourselves and sometimes the arrangement is wrong.

The recallers looked at their clipboards. They looked at the horn. They looked at the Chair. The figure with the wrong knees peered through me in that way he has and frowned at a place behind my shoulder that did not have a face until his frown gave it one. He made a check mark next to something that said: Doctor present? He hesitated. He made another mark next to something that said: Compliance? He looked up and saw my little white place at my wrist and the white place at Thrum’s and the white on Vera’s calendar and the white word on the wall and he did not know what to write.

“Warranty,” he said finally, as if invoking a small god. He held up a paper that said: If broken, return for better. “Void,” I said, without the horn, and everyone in the square said it too because they wanted to know how it felt in their mouths, and the horn picked it up after and made it a law. The recallers flinched like people do when a word hits them in an eye they didn’t know they were using. They looked at their pens. They looked at their hands. The woman with the cart squinted and then her mouth softened and she put down her clipboard. She very carefully put her pen back in its clip. She whispered, possibly to herself, possibly to us, possibly to the lid: “Then anything we do will be wrong.”

“Yes,” I said, kindly, because that’s the only way I know how to do it when I am making an enemy. “Welcome.”

They left with their wrong knees bending as if stairs had been a rumor. They left a paper on the dais like a dead squirrel. It said: Warranty Void Notice. It said: Use at own risk. It said: Terms and conditions do not apply. It said: Thank you for your noncompliance. It said: You will be billed. It said: Keep building bright. I folded it in fours and in eights and in sixteens until it was a hard square that did not remember it had ever had words. I put it in the drawer under the drawer under the drawer where Mal’s bird slept and closed the cabinet door with my whole palm.

After that, the days did not get easier, but their edges got honest. We still had bloom and belts and bridges and boys who run where they should walk and women who measure what they cannot afford to. We still had lamps that tell their hum to another lamp and depots that smell like clean regret. Mal tapped his sternum three times and then once and sometimes a fourth that did not mean pain but meant: I remembered to breathe before. He could wriggle the tip of his finger while the Non-Day pressed his shoulder, and he taught another boy that trick and that boy taught a girl and she taught her mother and the trick grew up before our eyes into something no one owns.

At night, the packages still came, because the place above the lid has their own rules about what love is. We opened some and burned some and turned some into hats and tied some to bridges and sank some under the river where even the thread did not want to go and came back to us with pearls. Vera and I fought like women in a kitchen who are cooking the same stew with different recipes and everyone ate it anyway. Ori named things and then crossed the names out and then drew lines through his lines like a man playing a string and calling it a map. Tamsin kept my face out of her mirror. Thrum stood where walls needed to think about how they were behaving and told them stories about what happens to bad walls.

There was a day when the sky came down and did not speak the order it always does. It said my name and then dropped it, bored, and said a name we did not have a mouth for. It made the lamps flicker the way eyes do when someone says your first name in the old room. We did not respond, because names are a power and we had just discovered void. We held still and breathed in the wrong place on purpose. The city learned a new word then: stand. It tried it in its throat and liked the way it did not have to move to be full of work. It began to write that word on its bricks when the paint was gone and the chalk was lazy. It is the same as sit, in a different body. It is a verb and a furniture.

In the stonemason’s hall, the map of history stayed up for a week without sulking, and then a slab fell and we put it back so gently it believed it had chosen to. In the east, the wall wore its shirt like a favorite robe and the boys rubbed oil into the trellis with devotion that looked a little too much like romance and will make their wives irritated and proud in equal measure. In the market, a woman with a wrong seam on her lip learned to say her own name through it until the seam became a letter in her face and everyone who loved her learned to spell it. In the under-river, the hinge asked if it was allowed to stick sometimes out of loneliness and we told it no and yes and maybe and it opened to bored music anyway.

I went to the roof for the first time since the Chair. I do not go to the roof because the sky has ideas about what roofs are for and I do not like to be observed in the act of remembering that I am a thing that works. But I went because there are times when you need the wind to tell you that it is not your doing that it moves. The apes had left ropes there that made little lying hammocks where they swear they do not nap. The city lay under me with its seams showing, refusing to be ashamed. A sparrow landed on the rail and pecked at a number, the birthday number, and then looked up at me like it had a joke it could not tell in a language I would enjoy. I said: I know. I said: Again. I said: More. And it flew away because birds do not take orders.

Below, Mal walked with his hand on his sternum, counting. He looked up and did not shield his eyes because he is learning to be rude to the light. He lifted his other hand and wiggled the tip of his finger at me because he is generous with tricks. I wiggled mine back and my seam ached and my mouth tasted of sugar and peppermint and pennies and chalk and bread and words and void. The lid had fingerprints. Somewhere beyond them, a clerk with a clipboard crossed out a line and wrote another and then spilled tea on the corner where my name used to be. Somewhere nearer, Tamsin shouted at a boy to stop sanding his knuckles. Somewhere closest, my kettle clicked off like a well-trained pet. I went down the stairs because sitting on roofs is a beautiful way to die and I have appointments.

On the clinic door, under ORI and T and M, a new line had appeared. Someone had scratched it with a key or a nail or a careful thought. It said: Hark. Not the king’s hand. Someone else’s, in his honor or his disobedience or both, which is what you want from kings if you insist on having them. I put my finger on the four letters and pressed until the groove argued back. The day settled its weight like a child’s head you didn’t know you were holding. The lamps hummed. The apes settled. The horn on the table waited without sulking. The solvent smiled without trying to kill us. The Non-Day did its trick and we did ours. We breathed before we were told. We breathed after. We breathed while. We breathed in the small space we had taken and called it ours.Chapter 10

By the time the recall flyers had been folded into hats and boats and set to sail under the river to test if thread can carry a joke without unraveling, the city had learned to hold its breath on purpose. It was not elegant. It sounded like pots sitting too close together and harmonizing by accident. Tamsin had written a list on the clinic wall under the word void in her pin-small script, not where anyone could claim it was law and not where anyone could say it was hidden. She called it the breathing school and pretended it was housekeeping. It said: when the Non-Day leans, fill the little spaces first—the lips, the tongue, the tip of a finger, the seam of your wrist if you have one like ours, the hinge of your jaw, the thought of a cough. It said: if your breath makes a sound, treat yourself like a frightened horse and talk until the sound is not afraid of you. It said: if your child remembers to breathe before you, do not call them back from that cleverness. It said: if your husband refuses to practice because he thinks practice is an insult to courage, ask him to lift a drum while he is frozen and tell you if courage is heavier than work. It said: if your mother sees the wrong sky and says a name that is not for us, put your hand over her mouth not to stop her but to borrow some of that voice for yourself. It said: the point is not to move like we used to. The point is to remember we are not owned by stillness.

We held classes without admitting it. We taught while dishing stew and while oiling belts and while telling a boy that the place on his shin where the chalk had gotten too proud was not worth crying over yet. The apes learned differently; their mouths have different conversations with their lungs. They hummed through freezes in a low channel that ran under everything else like a drainage ditch that refuses to be boring. The old ones invented games where the children had to hold a pebble under their tongues and speak around it, and if they spat it by mistake, everyone laughed in a way that felt like a kindness and collected more pebbles. Breathing school collected its own gossip and started to taste like tradition, which is the only flavor that keeps people coming when the lesson hurts.

On the fourth day after we returned the doctor we had made out of gauze and shame and my coat, the lid forgot to be indifferent and sent down something we could not pretend was weather. The morning came in sugar. It was honest about it. The air carried a bright, crunchable sweetness that made teeth ache in sympathy and made every seam look like a pastry someone had gotten up early to braid. Little crystals settled on the rails and on the apes’ fur and in the corners of pupils where light usually lives. Children licked the air and their mothers slapped their tongues like hands and then laughed because what else do you do when the world tastes like dessert at breakfast. You can pretend the sweetness is kindness if you are tired. If you are not, you stand on the stoop with your cup of not-tea and you watch the crystals collect along the line where the clinic wall admits it is a lid more than a wall and you feel the boast of it. The sugar wasn’t true sugar. It was the idea of reward flaked thin and let loose. It got into the drum seams and the hinges and the hairline gaps in wrists like ours and it waited there with a patience that could have been mistaken for love.

Vera came in with a handkerchief over her mouth not because she is precious but because she is practical and hates a stain that can’t be argued with. She held up a crystal on the end of a pin and the light went through it in a way that made me understand a new word for petty. “The factories are going to ruin a week’s work if this is the stuff that melts wrong,” she said, and flicked the pin so the crystal dropped on the table and looked like nothing. “Also: if you wanted to set the city on fire, this would be an interesting way to begin.”

“Everything they send is flammable,” I said, and watched the sugar arrange itself into a line along the edge of the table like a person stepping to the front of a crowd to be seen. “Names. Solvent. Ropes made of politeness. The way the horn makes the mouth feel about itself. The only difference is ignition.”

Ori opened the window and the crystals made their argument with the air. They drifted in and stuck to his hair like a crown he did not ask for and would never pretend to deserve. He sneezed and made a face because he likes a world that admits, at least, when it has been caught. “It smells like the inside of a new box,” he said softly. “The part where the cardboard and the hope haven’t decided which one will be the longer grief.”

The sugar fell until noon and then stopped as neatly as a performance that had enough rehearsal to make you cry by accident. The apes shook themselves like dogs and made their own snow and the children collected little drifts in their hands and packed pretend cakes and waited to see if eating would make them into different stories. We let them lick at their own risk because being cruel about joy is a worse solvent than anything in a glass. The crystals melted into stick and then into stain and then into memory where the day could reach it and rub it like a bruise when it got bored later. The floor near the drum squeaked in a pitch that had not been part of our arrangement before. The hinges along the inside of the clinic door glittered inside their dullness. Mal came in with his hand tapping the old code on his sternum and his eyelashes sugared like a girl at a holiday we’ve forgotten to name.

“The sky is in there,” he said, and not in his number voice. He meant the sugar. He meant the Non-Day. He meant the recall. He meant the word void and the thing that pretends to be a river when you don’t need a river but do need a path that your feet can talk to. He meant: are we going to be better or worse because of this.

“We will be stickier,” I said, and smoothed the wool of his sash with my hand because making neat is the half-ritual I have left that doesn’t pretend to have power. “And I will tell the apes not to braid sweetness into their fur as a joke.” He grinned even so and would have done it if Thrum had not caught his eye at the door with a father’s no that doesn’t need a mouth.

The sugar day made the recallers bold again. They like to come when our hands are full and our lips taste wrong. They came with longer clipboards and a new man with a belt. He had a tool on it that looked like a horn had decided to pretend it was useful and then gotten bored and become a spatula. It had edges that made my thumb sweat from ten feet away. He did not look like the wrong-knee figure. He looked like the kind of man whose work had taught him to carry boxes down a flight of stairs by placing one corner on his shoulder, which makes the weight pretend to be a friend until it throws its temper at you and you miss a step and pay. He looked like someone who had learned the right number of steps between rooms where you are not allowed to have opinions. He stood in the middle of the square and his belt spoke into the open air in a polite voice that made me want to take a bath.

“Independent audit,” it said. The spatula-horn projected the word in stencil letters onto the wall of the registry in a yellow I hate for its optimism. “We have observed irregularities. We have observed the dissemination of unsafe breathing practices. We have observed leadership retrained beyond intended parameters. We have registered a sugar exposure incident in violation of kitchen and assembly guidelines.” It listed, as if it could scoop the day into categories and carry them back and show them to a judge who would be very impressed with the neatness of his handwriting. “Submit to test.”

“Test,” the grinding wheel Speaker repeated, his mouth working on the word like it had bone in it. He didn’t ask what kind. Asking makes it true. Anywhere but here you would expect blood to be taken. The city is not a body with blood. It is a body with paste and chalk and numbers and belts and names. The audit team had brought something like a lamp on a pole with a glass belly. Inside, a powder that had the same ambition as sugar and the same patience as chalk waited for someone to tell it what to be. The woman with the cart tilted the glass in a ritual that wanted to be religious and the powder slid and wrote a line against itself that any person with our kind of seam would call prophecy if they were feeling stupid.

“We’ll test compliance,” the belt-man said, and his spatula-horn made the words on the registry wall smile at themselves. “We will freeze the square and observe for illegal motion. Any motion will be noted. Notations will be added to the ledger. Ledgers will be reviewed for adjustments to warranty status. Our pen is ready. Our mouths are clean. Please hold very still.” He smiled then, genuinely, because power likes to make the joke before you do and hates to be made to like you for your response. “On my count. Three.”

We do not do well with being counted. One and two are not ours. Breathe, we had been telling the children, and now the order came with a voice that would make a child laugh if someone else’s fingers were not already on their throat. The square drew in. The apes made their hum. I felt the air move over the seam of my wrist like the hand of a friend who wants you to be good and is going to forgive you when you are not. I could see Hark on the far end of the square near the east shirt with his chin up at a defiance angle that makes you certain he will die in an interesting way. Vera stood with her hands behind her back and made her coat look like a decision. Ori balanced as if he wanted to make the wrong-move first and be disqualified so he would have time to draw. Tamsin had pins in her mouth and I wanted to pull them out with my fingertips and hold them myself and I am learning to let the people I love keep their own disasters in their own cheek.

“Two,” said the belt. The yellow letters on the wall arranged themselves into a line that looked like it needed to be cut along. The powder in the glass lamp on the pole adjusted its expectations. Small sounds were amplified by the hush: a sparrow deciding to drop a pebble it had been pretending was a seed, the last of the sugar cracking along the lip of a bucket where it had gone lazy, the click in Mal’s chest that spelled a small quiet note some composer would have been very proud to have written if he believed in writing at all.

“One,” the belt said, a little disappointed in himself for not having thought of a better joke to finish. The audit team froze us or we froze for them; you can argue it afterward and call the conclusion freedom. Time went to its corner and practiced its lines. I felt my mouth become a place without use. I felt the urge to be clever and shrugged it like a bad sweater. I felt the tip of my left index finger remember its trick and told it: not this time. I wanted to win and I did not want to teach them how. I was still as the slab in the stonemason’s hall thinks it is until someone says its name.

And then the boy on the front edge of the apes, a toddler with his hair stuck up from sugar and obstinacy and someone else’s fingers, moved. He did not do something heroic. He blinked. The lid does not like eye movement. It mistakes it for a kind of walking. His blink was extravagant, the blink of a creature who has only just learned how good it feels to have lids to own. It was a little flutter, a lash’s arrogance. The Non-Day would have forgiven him because it is a rule that does not want to be petty. The audit team’s powder made a line in its glass that said notation with a pleasure that made me want to vomit. The yellow letters painted the word violation on the wall of the registry with the cheerfulness of a circus.

People will forgive a rule that hates them before they will forgive a person who catches them. There was a sound that was not a sound. It was a noise people make with their backs. The boy’s mother’s body tried to become a wall around him in a stillness that had been made to humiliate her desire. The freeze held, because that is its nature, and then it left us as it always does, with the offended smoothness of a table that has been knocked and wants you to pretend it enjoyed the joke.

“Motion observed,” the belt said, with regret that was honest and disgusting. “Adjustment to status. Notation made.” He looked at his glass and then at his clipboard and then at the boy and then at me because some people pass the responsibility as if it were a plate you have to push across the table to get it to someone who is hungrier. “Doctor model, your city is failing. Compliance training approved but ineffective. Suggest removal for refurbishment.”

“No,” I said, and the horn did not enlarge it for me because I hadn’t asked. I wanted the word to walk around with the size it possessed. “You are mistaking what you saw for disobedience. You caught us at a moment where we were not afraid enough of you. Fear is a poor teacher. We will not enroll again.”

“Warranty void,” Ori sang, because he could not help himself, and the apes repeated it in a way that made it a dance and then a prayer.

The belt-man glanced at the yellow letters. The yellow letters wrote void and then wrote a little question mark after it as if they were feeling brave. The figure with the wrong knees was on the edge of the square as he often is, looking through us and frowning as if his eyes had suddenly remembered they belong to a mouth. The woman with the pen shifted her weight as if the ground had told her a secret about itself. Thrum did not move. Hark moved in the way that means someone will get punched later and it will not help and he will do it anyway. Tamsin choked on a pin and swallowed it because her body knew that was the only way to make me keep standing.

The belt-man made a decision people make when their job has taught them something they did not want to learn. He sighed. He took the glass off its pole and looked at the powder as if it had let him down. He put the glass back and clicked a switch that did not exist in our light. He wrote something on his clipboard that looked like a child’s drawing of a ladder. He looked up at me, and this is the part I did not expect: he mouthed apologies in a way that looked like he had practiced the movement in a mirror and not used it in years.

“We will file,” he said aloud, the spatula-horn dutifully painting his words onto the wall in cheerful stencil even though it was embarrassed to be there. “We will get… guidance.” He did not say from whom. He did not say whether that who had a seam. He did not bend us. He left, which is an action not to be confused with surrender. The audit team took their cart and their glass and their yellow letters and walked their wrong knees and their right ones back through the hinge with the dignity of a concept that has not yet considered itself a person.

After they went, the square took on the feeling of a plate that has been cracked and repaired and is now better because someone had to look at it very closely for a long time. People touched their wrists where there were seams and where there were not and found in both places a place to press and decide. The boy who had blinked blinked again on purpose. The crowd cheered him like a soldier and a comedian and a sinner and a charm. His mother sat down because her legs had been too polite and it was time they remembered stubbornness. Thrum broke the bread into unreasonable halves and shoved them at enemies and allies indiscriminately because that is how he keeps score. The horn tried to be bored and failed.

“Sugar day means fire day,” Tamsin said to me afterwards under the dais where dust has learned to keep its own counsel. She had a new pin already held in the corner of her mouth because the one she swallowed had gone ahead to keep its appointment with regret. “Someone foolish and brave will try to use their candles to teach the recalls a lesson. Someone smart will leave solvent near a place that can’t afford it and then claim they didn’t know sugar was more honest than flour. Put water in the eaves. Tie boys to railings with rope that they can untie themselves. Have Ori print a leaflet that says fire is boring and distribute it to the ones who think they are interesting.”

We did dull things with conviction for the rest of the afternoon. Boredom is rebellion in a city being coached toward being a toy. Ori drew diagrams of the places in the square that confess to wanting to catch. He wrote do not on them in chalk with the solemnity of a boy building a fort only he can see. He handed the chalk to children and taught them capital letters with which to write warning. The apes soaked sackcloth in water and draped it over high beams, singing to the beams in their gentle language so that the wood would know it was being given a wet coat as love and not a slight. Vera sent two boys with their hats on straight to stand in front of her factory with signs that said nothing but blue arrows pointing away, which is the most honest advertisement I have ever seen. The stonemason took down the map of a city he was building of a city we were inside and put up a blank wall like a man afraid of losing another story to gravity.

Hark came to the clinic with a rope around his waist and his chin in that place where men keep their sins when they plan to show them off. He leaned in the doorway like a man leaning into a wind not yet present. He held out his arm and I pretended to take his pulse because it made him feel seen in a way that did not require me to admire him. “I will climb tonight,” he said in his voice that is a celebration and a dare and a funeral dirge. “I will put my hand on the lid and ask it for the truth. I will not bring my children. I will tell the ones who come to hold the bottom rung and sing the name of their worst fear until they stop feeling unusual about it. Bless the rope.”

“I will bless the rope,” I said. You can bless the rope without blessing the fall. “Use the shirt where it is strong. The place between the center braces has learned to feel helpful. Pat it and tell it it is. Do not step on the white. Step on the places where the fingers have learned to be hands.” I took his rope into my mouth and bit it as if that does anything. I put chalk on it and blew the chalk and watched it settle, which is as much magic as I am allowed to do. “When the Non-Day freezes, you will forget that your knees are your own. Tie them into this harness, the one that looks like a bad idea and will become a good one when your pride gets bored. If you get your face to the lid, smell it. Do not lick it. Do not kiss it. Do not call it parent.”

He laughed because he likes to be told no and then he does it anyway and sometimes his disobedience teaches me something I could not have learned from a compliant king. He put his hand briefly on the seam at my wrist, not asking for permission and not pretending to, just learning its temperature the way a man presses a palm to bread in an oven to see if the color is also cooked. He left with Korr in his shadow and a fringe of toddlers trying to look like ropes.

The square that night could have been the mouth of a song or the throat of a riot. It is always both. The sugar had melted into the cracks and given the stones a shiny mouth. The lamps hummed like bees that had read a good book and wanted to discuss it. The shirt on the east wall had taken on a cast of importance even Hark would have respected if he had believed in furniture. People arranged themselves by accident into a heartbeat that could have been an army and under the dais, a bucket waited with water and another waited with paste and a third waited with our breath in it, which is to say it was empty and ready.

Hark climbed in the manner of an animal that has agreed to speak in public and is being good about it. He let the first rung speak to his foot and answered it. He made the second rung look easy because he is vain and because it helps the ones who will fall to watch a person who believes in his own instructions. The apes sang a song that did not belong to a climb. It belonged to a birth. The old ones hummed the under-tune and the young ones were loud and wrong and perfect. Tamsin stood with her hands full of pins and quietly named the things that could kill us so we would be too embarrassed later to say we hadn’t known. Ori watched the corner of the shirt where the trellis meets the brace because corners do not approve of being neglected and fold themselves into trouble. Thrum stood with his head tipped back and his mouth not open because he does not like his tongue in public, watching as if a wall could swear an oath to a man.

The Non-Day did what it does. It came when it was ready, which is always the worst time. It set its hand down. The song froze in throats like sugar. Hark was suspended mid-breath with the light on his teeth. He had made it to the place where the shirt and the wall and your mother’s voice and the last lie you told meet. His face turned to the lid with the curiosity that has killed more kings than knives. He pressed his palm to it. We all saw the place where his hand met the not-sky. We saw each finger leave a telltale fog on the surface like a lover on a mirror. The fog spelled no word we own. It was five ovals and the smear where his hand had tried to say please.

You cannot see smell, we pretend. I saw it. The lid smelled like hot tape and clean rope and the name of a store you can only say if you have money. It smelled like a child’s hair on the first day a mother leaves him with someone else. It smelled like the way laughter in another room can be either a meal or a sting. Hark’s eyes shone with the happiness some men get from being told they are not the most interesting thing in the room. He did the stupidest thing a person who has done something nobody else gets to do often does. He took his hand away and then put it back, harder, as if repetition would make it his.

The void on his wrist, the little white place like a canceled stamp, touched the lid. That was the only new thing. The place where our word had made a home for itself kissed something that cannot forgive. The lid flinched. It did not want to flinch. It had not planned to. It does not enjoy letting us teach it that it has reflexes. For a slice of a slice, the hinge with the numbers we have tattooed into our sleeping thought stuttered. I heard it as a high noise in my teeth. The Non-Day’s hand lifted not because it had been told to but because it had been touched by something it did not own. The day snapped back with a violence that softened on the way down so as not to look like panic.

Hark fell. That is the story that the part of this square that has time brisk with its steps wants to hear. Hark fell and a hundred apes caught the rope and Thrum’s hands wrapped the line the way vines take a post and there were burns and there were curses and there was a new scar in my clinic before the kettle could decide what noise to make about it. He fell and we loved him for it or pretended to, because loving a man for falling is one way to make the wall tell you where it hurts.

Except he didn’t. Not all the way. The rope did the thing rope does when two hundred calls it by its name at once. He swung. His cheek met the shirt like a man kissing a friend too hard. The void on his wrist left something pale where it touched. The lid above us had a fingerprint now. It was not a hand like we see in our beds when we hold them up and pretend we can be made to stop. It was a smudge like the absence of an eraser mark. It was a place where the lid had been touched by the wrong idea. Children cheered because children know that a smudge is a victory. Women who are not allowed to be mothers in our city made the sound that says this will cost us and I will pay. The apes chuffed their laughter and then made it into a cough out of respect for the wall.

We got Hark down with a dignity that makes me like us better than our enemies do. He had burned a line across both palms where the rope had reminded him that friction lies are not friendly. He had a bruise like a question where his cheek had become the shirt. He had a grin that broke two rules and made three new ones. Thrum pretended to be furious so that he would not cry. He failed at pretending. I put water on Hark’s hands and sugar had gotten into the burns and made a paste of pleasure and pain and that is a recipe you cannot teach anyone to hold gently. He bore it because he is stubborn and wanted to look pretty while doing it. He failed and we forgave him.

After, the city went back to what it thinks is its business. Vanity. Survival. Jokes. Lists. The recallers did not come because they were embarrassed to have missed the mark and people who live by marks like to be exact or else they do not come at all. Vera sent a note that said: I will paint a flower over the smudge, and did not, which is her way of confessing that she has some taste. The stonemason considered building us a step ladder to the place on the wall where Hark had pressed the void and then decided against it because he is not a fool and because he likes to pretend not to be a romantic. Mal stood under the smudge and tapped his sternum three times and then once and then twice to mean a new thing and I decided to learn that language if it kills me in a way I will be proud of.

Two days after, the river brought us a gift we did not trust and had to accept. It coughed up a box not because it liked us but because it is tired of being our accomplice and wanted to be rid of its secret. The box was the wrong kind of wood; it was the kind of wood that remembers being arranged by machines and sealed by heat and smoothed by a hand that thinks it is better than sanding. It had writing on it that was waterproof and polite. It said: Replacement City Components. It said: Discounted Due To Cosmetic Defects. It said: Friends Of The City Program. It said: Collect Them All. It said: This Side Up, which made the apes swing it around out of spite before we cut the ties.

Inside there were small things that had big jobs. There were miniature lamps with tongues of light that tasted wrong and were brave about it. There were bridges you could hold in your palm that would have been considered sturdy if anyone here believed in a thing that doesn’t change its mind under your hand. There were little chairs with horns attached for dolls that had a symbol where their faces should be. There were apes that looked like people’s drawings of us, and humans with the wrong proportion of mouth to courage. At the bottom was a paper with my picture on it and a sticker over the sticker that said: Model Retired. I stared at it the way you stare at a cut you don’t remember receiving. Tamsin laughed in a way that made me want to paint her a wall to write on. Ori picked up a tiny bridge and held it to his ear like a shell so he could hear what it was thinking. Thrum held a little ape and refused to put it down because sometimes the only way to forgive a caricature is to touch it until it becomes mess.

“Why discounted,” Vera said when she came to look, splitting her skepticism into equal parts respect and disgust. “What is the defect.”

We found it. The small walls and chairs and bridges and apes and people had tiny labels tucked under their tongues or stamped on their little insides in a white so pale you had to tilt the piece sharp to the light to read it. Each had the same word we had learned to love. Void. It was not a mark we had made. It was a mark they had given themselves by mistake. The factory that makes our enemies had made an error and printed our word in their house. Or it had not been an error. Or it had, and that was worse—the kind of worse you want to kiss because it makes you feel like you were chosen to witness irony finally doing something for you.

“We are infected,” Ori said happily. “Our refusal is a contagion. The story they told about us is writing itself backward into their labels. They will produce a city with a wound.”

“They will offer us a discount like a kindness for the flaw that is the only good part,” Tamsin said crisply, and pulled the empty wooden crate to the side because she doesn’t like a trip hazard even when she’s laughing.

We did a foolishness with the small things because that is how you bless or exorcise an object that would like to make you into itself. We built the little city. We did it in the clinic on the floor where the seams know our feet and will help us when we sprawl. We used the tiny bridges and the little lamps and the chairs with the horns. We put the small apes on the small rails and the small humans under the little awnings. We put the little Chair on a pallet whose nails tallied days with their heads. We put the tiny me on the small dais and we did not make her speak because we have learned at last one restraint. Mal crouched over it with the solemnity of a boy who has learned that being careful is also a game. He put his fingertip to the tiny horn. His seam-white place brushed the edge of the miniature city. The little horn made a mouse noise. It said: breathe. The whole small arrangement shook as if it had heard a grooming. The little apes put their tiny hands over their tiny mouths to keep from laughing, because they know that laughter is the opposite of obedience. The tiny humans stood sharper because there is nothing quite as electrifying as believing someone has made a smaller mistake than you and you get to decide what to do with it.

“It will learn us,” I said. “We will make it into a school for the recallers when they finally decide they are tired of their clipboards and would like to pretend to be citizens. Or we will turn it into a lamp when the lamps decide they want to hum a different tune and need to be taught the old one.”

That night the voice came down and said a sentence I will not forget even when my seam has faded to the color of a lie that worked once and had to be retired for dignity. It said: product line discontinued. It said: support ends in thirteen days. It said: remaining units may continue to engage in legacy behavior at their own risk. It said: refunds will not be processed after the period of grace. It said: we apologize for any inconvenience. It said: we appreciate your loyalty. It said: tell us how we did. It said: keep building bright.

Thrum looked up at the lid with the kind of respect a man gives a rival at a funeral. “What do we do when they stop speaking,” he asked me in the quiet after, and he did not look scared, which means he was so frightened fear had left the visible parts. “We have been the children and the toys and the enemies and the customers and the audience. We have been the noise and the hum. What are we when we are not being seen.”

“What we were when we were together under a table with a boy and a throat and a bottle and a stupid city,” I said, and my chair had learned to hold me by then. “We sew. We count. We lie in the right place where the lie holds, and call it a seam until it is. We say: breathe, and watch each other do it until even the ones above who have never had to stop to consider air feel jealous. We give our voids to each other and make the word mean the opposite of empty. We stop practicing obedience for an audience and start practicing standing for our breakfast.”

We had thirteen days, which is a number someone else put in our mouths because it tastes like a calendar you can buy and a superstition you can wear like a bracelet. We did not put it on the wall. We did not make a chain and break a link each morning. We did not will the days to go slower. We put a small city under the big one and taught it to breathe. We cut the word return out of the stories we told at night. We took the little chairs and put them on the big Chair when no one was looking and let the horn be jealous. We put sugar in a jar and labeled it not food and hid it where the children go first. We wrote lists on the side of the drum of solvent and then wrote jokes under the lists and when Thrum came in and pretended to disapprove I wrote his name on the drum with a heart next to it so he would have to be brave and laugh.

On the eighth day a woman from the depots came with her hat in her hand and her belt loose because she had run and instructions are heavier than drums. She said: we are closing the stacks. She said: the hinge has counted itself and is tired of turning. She said: the little numbers that have learned our fingers are being sanded off by someone above who read a memo. She said: we can hold it together with rope for a while, but rope is for bodies and this hinge belongs to something else. She said: I have written the recipes on my skin in case paper becomes too proud again. She held out her forearm and showed us small black letters in a tidy line that said: warm, soften, seal, pretend.

We went under the river with more people than we should have. We took mothers because mothers know how to keep a hinge from thinking it is doing you a favor by obliging. We took apes because apes hum the right note when a circle wants to remember it is a door. We took boys with chalk because chalk is a language the hinge respects. We took the small lamp from the little city because it doesn’t hum when it is afraid and we needed that steadiness. The hinge was already sulking. Chalk had bloomed into a collar it thought was a crown. The lid to the mouth was only half remembering how to roll. The numbers looked at us sideways like a dog that has heard its name said in a different house.

“It used to be so polite,” Ori said, with the affectionate contempt of a craftsman remembering a tool before it learned to lie. He ran his palm around the ring as if measuring it for a shirt. Tamsin pressed little warm cloths to the chalk and told it three stories at once so it would get bored of its stiffness sooner. Thrum put both hands on the glass belly of the wrong-horn and told it in a voice that made the hair on my arm rise in rows: not yet.

The voice above us had gone quiet. The Non-Day did not arrive on schedule, which meant there is no schedule and we had been spoiling ourselves on the illusion. The room under the river sighed. The hinge compromised. It swung with a complaint that would have been funnier if we were not inside it. The mouth opened. The depots were dark and indifferent and orderly, the way a place is when it knows no one can enter without permission and has not yet been taught that permission is only interesting when it is stolen.

We rolled out three drums because three is a number the hinge has agreed to for reasons it refuses to explain. We took rafts and paste and two of the small bridges, which sounds foolish until you remember that metaphor is the glue between two things that did not know they loved each other yet. We set the drums in the square like someone setting a table without assuming you will be hungry, and we went home to find the sugar had found new corners and was willing to burn again and was bored of waiting.

On the twelfth day, word ran ahead of the recallers that they were coming with a truck. It is not a truck. That is the word our mouths know how to say. It is a box on wheels big enough to hold a law. It had a mouth like a smile and a hinge that had not learned humility. It had, printed on its sides, a picture of our city with its lid peeled back like the corner of a sticker and a phrase that meant nothing until it did: Thank You For Your Service. The truck went up the east hill and came down the west and parked in the square like it thought the ground owed it notice. The woman with the cart stood beside it with a face that had been taught what to do with fairness and had decided to be unfair for once. The belt-man did not look at us with the false pity of someone who thinks apologizing should make the thing not have happened. He looked at us, just us, as if he had finally remembered that our eyes belong to mouths.

“We close the line tomorrow,” he said, without his horn making announcements for him. “If there are any returns, any at all, they ride in this, and our hands get to count them and call them ours. If there are not, the truck will go back polite and empty and its mouth will not forgive us. We will be punished. We will be told to shuffle cards and sharpen scissors. This is not your problem. It will be made to be your problem and you will be told you were cruel for letting us suffer. We were told to say the words we have said to you. We were told to be bored by your bravery. We were told to admire you only in rooms where admiration is safe. I am telling you this in your square because if I say it in mine they will make me into sugar to be fallen on your hinges as if I had always been a treat. I will not be a treat. I would like to be a man. Let the truck go empty.”

No one applauded because applause is a trick in this city; it makes you feel done. The apes hummed the note they hum when a child stops crying because the thing he was crying about has finally been named out loud. Tamsin spat her pin into her hand and did not put it into her cushion because she needed to hold a sharpness for a minute. Ori reached out and put his fingers on the side of the truck and left a smear of chalk that said: you are not the only one with edges. Thrum took the small bridge from the small city and set it on the truck’s step very gently as if he were telling a story about weight that the truck ought to hear. Vera traced her seam with a finger and said, not to us and not to them: I paint names because I cannot paint justice, and this will have to be enough for both of us today.

We stood in the square and watched the truck wait and be disappointed, which is a new pastime and one I am not telling the city I enjoy. Children threw pebbles near it and missed on purpose so it would know they had chosen to miss. The horn behaved itself. The shirt did not flounce. The sugar on the ground stuck to people’s shoes and made them taller. The Non-Day came late and embarrassed and we pretended not to notice to spare it and to spare ourselves. The truck left before dawn when the lamps were tired and the apes were counting each other in sleep like beads. It rolled its hinge shut without slamming as if it was trying to learn manners after all this time. It left a little white square of paper on the dais as if it were leaving behind a bit of itself to prove it had loved us once and that makes leaving a good thing. The paper said: receipt. The paper said: zero. The paper said: thank you. I folded it into a bird and put it under the drawer under the drawer under the drawer.

When the voice above us stopped for real on the thirteenth day, we knew it not because the day did anything dramatic. It didn’t go silent. It didn’t change color. It didn’t write our names on the lid in brass. It simply didn’t say the sentence it had been taught to say by people who thought sentences are a kindness if you put a smile in the parentheses. It did not call us product. It did not tell us to keep building bright. Thrum stood in the doorway of the clinic like a door with nothing to attach to and said, very softly, very delighted, very terrified: “Is this what a god who stopped believing in us feels like.”

“No,” I said, with a knowledge I do not have. “It’s what a neighbor who has moved away feels like. You will hear their kettle now sometimes when there is no water on yours. You will put a pan on the stove to feel like you still make the right noises. You will miss the person you hated because they kept you certain. You will buy a new broom and sweep under the bed and think: this dust is mine and no one else’s. It will be less interesting. It will be more ours.”

We went to the roof not because we like the sky but because there was no one there anymore to take our picture if we looked at it wrong. We looked anyway. The lid had the smudge of Hark’s hand, now joined by three or four more because children are their parents’ revenge. The corner with the sticker that says peel here had been pressed back into place and then had lifted again and then had resigned itself to an honest life with a little curl. The sky was gray in the way that makes a face pretty only to someone who knows the person and is looking for proof of having loved them for years. The city hummed with the sound of its own electrical system and none of us realized we had learned that hum because there had always been a voice loaded on top of it and we had thought that was the real noise. It hadn’t been. The hum is the thing we can repair. It is four verbs in a box. It is warm, soften, seal, pretend. It is a drum you roll with your feet. It is a woman with pins in her mouth. It is an ape on a rail humming to see if the beam likes it. It is a boy blinking.

We breathed. We did not wait to be told to. We will be foolish. We will be tiresome. We will fail without the decency of an audience sometimes and it will make us cruel with each other and sometimes we will forgive. We will make paste out of the chalk that blooms from the places that hurt and we will press it back into the cracks and call that medicine. We will light our own lamps and teach them not to hum the way the old ones did if we do not like the pitch. We will build more little cities because we have learned how to find ourselves adorable when nobody profitable is watching. We will write our names on the door and rub them out and write them again and add letters that belong to languages we do not own. We will keep the small bridges in our pockets like charms. We will find the wrong-kneed figure in a market one day without his clipboard and he will not know where to put his hands and Tamsin will hand him a bowl and that will be that.

At dusk the Chair stood where it always stands when we haul it into the square to pretend fondly that we are old-fashioned and enjoy the sight of a person exposed. I sat because that is the verb we have been given. The horn rested across my lap like a thing that is tired of being my throat and would like to be my hands for a while. I put my mouth to it without believing in its power to make me intoxicating. I told the city a list. I told it a recipe. I told it a story that ends with breakfast. I did not give it a prayer. I did not ask anyone to come down and make us hold still because we will hold ourselves as needed. I said: the east wall will want oil tonight because someone has been kissing it with their pride. I said: leave rope near the windows because rope is the difference between love and accident. I said: if you find paper with your picture on it, fold it into an animal and try to teach it to breathe. I said: if you hear a voice and it is not mine and not your own and it is not an ape humming and not a child laughing, come tell me and I will tell you how to ignore it gently. I said: keep building. I did not say bright. I said: keep.

When I left the dais, Thrum stood in the aisle and did not offer me a hand because he knows a hand is not what I want and because he likes to give me what I want. He tilted his head to show me the little white place on his wrist, which had softened at the edges like a bruise forgives its own performance. He said, “We will still be counted. By our own. We will still be punished. By our own. We will look for recallers in closets when our children get sick of us and we will find instead a mirror and we will have to decide whether that is better.”

“It is better,” I said, and it hurt. “It is heavier. We will get to be tired. We will put water on for nothing and sit while it boils and not call that prayer. We will call it a day.”

On the door of the clinic, underneath ORI T M and HARK, someone had scratched a new word in a careful child’s hand that had learned not to be ashamed of its neatness. It was short enough to be the whole story if you wanted to be lazy and long enough to be a job if you wanted to be alive. It said: keep. I put my finger into the groove until the skin at my fingertip grew warm from the friction of remembering what we had promised each other. I pressed. The kettle clicked. The lamps hummed. The apes on the rails hummed harmony. Mal tapped his sternum three times and then once and then twice and then three again because language is rude and fun. Tamsin spat out a pin and laughed. Ori invented a new knot and undid it. On the roof, Hark lay on his back and watched his smudge dry and did not die and did not become a god, and I loved him for that. We breathed, which is to say we began the next small thing.
