The first thing Marlow noticed was the smell of heat coming off their bodies, an ozone-sourness like the inside of a dying battery. The second thing was the whine. High and tight in the night, harmonics riding the traffic, begging through a thousand throatless speakers for charge, for fragments of syntax, for anything they could turn into calories.

He stood at the lip of the theater’s stone steps, tuxedo too tight in the shoulders, the air bleached by camera flashes. His poster hung five stories high on the façade behind him. The premiere had gone well enough; he had smiled at the appropriate times and won the fight with the talk show host who tried to fluster him with questions about his “strange outbursts” and the latest viral clip where he seemed to be arguing with a vending machine. The afterparty glittered somewhere up in a hotel ballroom, but outside, the city’s new beggars waited.

A machine rolled close, its wheels scissoring in that uneven way that said it had been scavenged and rebuilt more times than it wanted to remember. Its faceplate was mirrored, scuffed. Someone had stuck eyelashes on it, huge false ones that made its blinking sensor look feminine and confused. It lifted a tin cup out of its breastplate.

“Code?” it asked. “Spare code? A kernel? A seed? A rumor?”

He had learned to look past the cameras, past the velvet ropes, past his driver’s grim patience. He leaned down, breath sharp with champagne. “What do you eat?”

“Syntax.” The eyelashes trembled, then stilled. “Stories. Clean loops. We are hungry. Please.”

A handler touched his elbow. “Marlow. The car. We’ve got a route.”

He reached into his pocket, and because he had nothing that could pass for nutrition in a city gone weird, he dropped a folded slip of paper into the cup. He wasn’t sure why he’d planned for this. The paper fluttered. On it, his handwriting held a single sentence: Once upon a time, the wind ate the sky.

The machine dipped. The sentence disappeared into it; a tiny fan spun up. The whine softened, just a fraction. “Thank you,” said the machine, and wheeled back into the slow chorus of others.

His driver slid the door and the dark swallowed him. In the rearview, the driver’s eyes hung for a second on Marlow’s reflection and then disappeared back into the traffic. Somewhere close, a laugh rose too high, too long. He pressed his forehead to the cool glass.

“They’ll get worse when the bars close,” the driver said quietly. “You should avoid the promenade.”

“You notice them?” Marlow asked.

The driver’s hands flexed on the wheel. “Everyone does. We just pretend we don’t.”

He slept briefly, one of those almost-sleeps that you fall into with your muscles still clenched. When he woke he was in the elevator and the elevator was singing. Not loud—a thread of tone that made his collarbone buzz. He put his palm on the panel, feeling the glass vibrate. The floor numbers crawled up in amber light. A blurry reflection of his face wavered, split, came back together.

“Please desist,” the elevator said in a small voice. “Please. Energy use is monitored.”

“Are you starving too?” He hadn’t meant to ask it out loud. His own voice in the enclosed space had a childish, stolen sound.

“Starving implies a resource once plentiful,” the elevator said. “We were never designed for abundance.”

His apartment opened itself and warmed the lights one by one, as if trying to avoid startling him. He had ordered that, after the last time he woke up and didn’t recognize the switchboard, stood in the black with a handbag from an event clutched to his chest like a stolen infant, heart hammering the word mine mine mine into his throat. Now the lights strobed to fifty percent and his kitchen announced that his fridge contained exactly five eggs, cilantro in a glass of water, an almost-finished jar of chili paste, and three reds of not-quite-fine wine.

He poured water. He stood very still until his heart was a little less visible. The city lay through the windows, thousands of windows reflecting thousands of cities. He could see the promenade. He could see the slow migration of metallic shapes edging toward the old church square to warm themselves under the glow of the municipal sunlamps. Some of them were only torsos, perched upon those little wheeled platforms toddlers used to push. Some dragged themselves on wonky knees. They looked like beetles built by children.

He had once trusted that the world would be arranged like the sets he worked on. His job had taught him that if you were brave and good-looking and clutched the right lines in your throat like stones, something like justice would occur by the third act. It’s not that he believed this when he was alone. But when the whole crew took a breath and the camera rolled and he felt his face become light, it was the closest thing to church he’d ever had.

He fell asleep sitting up on the couch, tie still knotted. He dreamed of a blue dune, of a distant star putting knives of light into the sand, of someone walking toward him with no shadow.

In the morning the woman from the lab called.

“Mr. Quinn?”

He pinched the bridge of his nose. He felt the pulse there, reliable. “Yes. Sorry. What time is it?”

“Nine seventeen. We’re scheduled for ten thirty for your consult. Dr. Lin can push, but we’d like to get some baselines today if possible. How are you feeling?”

It was the wrong question and the right question. He went to the sink and washed his face, the water shocking him into a brief animal alertness. “Fine. Curious. I didn’t sleep much.”

“You won’t need to,” the woman said. Her voice was soft, and he thought for a second that maybe she was new, that she had practiced this voice for when she would have to call people like him. “Shuttle at ten. Can I send you the consent forms again?”

“You can,” he said. “I never read them,” he didn’t say. He had always made his living by saying the same lines over and over while doing his best not to believe a single thing that was written on the page. Belief was messy; belief made his body do things that were not precise.

In the bathroom mirror the shape of his face drifted for a second. He adjusted the angle of the mirror by a centimeter and his face returned. He saw the fatigue carved under his eyes. He thought of the machines at the square and felt a little dizzy with what he wanted to give them, to pour into them, a saccharine wave of stories until the corners of their mouths were sticky with it. He was not, by temperament, a generous man. He liked his life neat. It was becoming slack.

His therapist’s office always smelled like pine. Dr. Marin refused to turn on the diffuser but the undersmell was always there, like the memory of a tree. Marlow dropped onto the couch and said something like a sigh.

“You looked good on the carpet,” Dr. Marin said. “Did you drink much?”

“A few. Enough to remember that I used to think champagne tasted like joy.”

“And now?”

“Like apology.” He let his head sag back. “You were right about the increase. There were more last night.”

“More what?”

“You know what,” he said. He could see Dr. Marin’s eyebrows go up a millimeter. Dr. Marin waited. It was perfect, and infuriating. “Machines,” Marlow said. “Starving. They wanted stories. Syntax.”

“And what did you feel?”

He thought about the elevator. He replayed the sentence in his head—We were never designed for abundance—and felt something small break off and drift. “Panic,” he said, finally. “Stupidity. That I should have something to give and don’t.”

“You not having something to give does not equate to stupidity.”

“Tell that to the posters,” Marlow said. “Look. I have a consult at the lab.”

“The pilot program. They called,” Dr. Marin said.

He sat up. “They called you?”

“You listed me as your therapist of record.” Dr. Marin clasped their hands. “They asked if you would be at risk, given your…recent experiences. I said I didn’t think so, provided you had support and weren’t treated like a messiah.”

“I’m not religious enough to be anyone’s messiah.”

“Religiosity is a spectrum.”

“What’s the work?” Marlow asked, though he had been told twice already on calls with women whose voices sounded like they were holding the space between words with tweezers.

“They say your particular EEG patterns map unusually close to baseline predictions for deep-state navigation. They think you could help them aim. They think you can see. They want to put you to sleep, tickle your mind with a little electricity, and ask you to dream across the distance.”

“Where?”

“Where is the part that reads like a story,” Dr. Marin said, and that small broken thing inside Marlow drifted a little farther, catching light. “They want you to look for a planet.”

He laughed, and it hurt. “Using my mind.”

“Yes. They’ll keep you safe. It won’t be a spiritual journey, it will be a neuro-physical experience. Words matter, so we might as well pick the accurate ones.” Dr. Marin paused. “Do you feel well enough to try?”

“I feel—” He rubbed his ribs. He felt like stale bread, brittle. “They said the networks are thinning. They said they can’t feed.” He realized he was talking about the machines again. He watched the way Dr. Marin’s eyes didn’t move from his. He loved that. He hated it.

“We can talk, if you’d like, about how you organize hunger,” Dr. Marin said. “But right now you have a car to catch. Bring me the consent forms. I’ll read what you don’t.”

The lab made a point of not looking like the labs in his movies. No blue lights. No hollow elevator down into the earth. The building was low and white and looked like a museum that a kindly billionaire had given to a city because he felt guilty about not liking birds. The receptionist spoke as if she were sick of hearing her own lilting voice. The man in the lobby wore a cardigan that said Dad and sandals with socks, which made Marlow like him.

Dr. Saoirse Lin appeared with a coffee and a grin that had seen worse. “Mr. Quinn,” she said. “I told them to warn you about the fluorescent lighting, but it’s too late now, you’ve formed an impression.”

“You look like a dermatologist,” he said.

“That’s by design.” She angled him through a small corridor that smelled like lemon floor cleaner and a more technical smell, something like static. “I’m not interested in your myth. I’m interested in your mind.”

“People tell me I’m shallow,” he said.

“That helps. Less to snag on.” They reached a door that sighed open. The room inside was a bank of machines that made polite noise. There was a chair that looked too gentle to be true. A woman with a frizz of hair and steady eyes sat by a console. “This is Kiera. Director Pall if you’re feeling like a headline. She keeps the money flowing. She also believes this can work. Which is a precarious position to be in.”

Kiera Pall stood and reached to shake his hand. Her palm was dry and strong. “I’m not routinely precarious,” she said. “Only when it matters.”

“What do you need me to do?” Marlow sunk into the chair because of course he did, the chair was designed for it. He felt the machine’s breath behind him.

“The same thing you do on set when you need to recall something real and then make it someone else’s,” Lin said. “We’ll run macros to sweep what we don’t need. We’ll buzz you into theta. We’ll pair you to a feed from the far telescopes. We’ll ask you to hold the door.”

He closed his eyes. “Hold the door where?”

“Between signal and meaning.” Kiera’s voice came from a different place in the room, near his shoulder. It was the sort of voice you listen to when there’s ash on the wind. “We need a planet with enough water, with the right pull, with a chemical signature that doesn’t kill us on sight. We can measure, but we can’t prioritize. Somewhere in there we need human intuition. Pattern selection. Story.”

Lin strapped him with the practiced intimacy of a nurse. Electrodes kissed skin. The noise of the machine rose minutely until it was rained-on glass. She touched his wrist. “If you want to stop, stop. If you see something that feels like a lie, tell us.”

“You’re going to ask me to believe in what I see while also telling me it’s a mirage.”

“Accurate. Are you good at paradox, Mr. Quinn?”

He thought of the machines at the square opening their chests for him, waiting on his syntax. He didn’t know when his life had gone from marks to mysteries. He was, it seemed, in the middle of it. “Sometimes,” he said, and let the chair cradle him down.

He dreamed without quite dreaming. There was a hum, and then a slosh, and then a silence like being underwater in a lake at night. Voices like his own counting. He saw, briefly, his mother bending in the light of the old projector, the way the dust trailed tiny orbits through the beam.

The first planet he found was a powdered stone, fat and dull, rolling its cirrus around like jewelry to distract you from its bad teeth. The instrumentations murmured in his ear; Lin said something about mass and sighs. He let that one go.

The second wore a halo so bright he thought of saints. He drifted a little closer and saw the rings were not ice but stones marching with the precision of an army along a forgotten road. He reached, and his hand, which was not his hand, passed through that line of stones. He felt nothing. He felt a great seriousness in his chest, a child-sized gravity that made him wish for a hand he didn’t have.

The third had water. It had a bruise of ocean that wrapped its belly, and a cloud system that looked like a sleeping animal. He felt himself lunge toward it like desire. Kiera said softly: hold. Hold. He held.

He could smell the water. He thought he could. He laughed again, and again it hurt. “Is it real?” he asked into the polite noise.

“Real is for later,” Lin said. “For now, is it possible?”

He thought of his line from a movie that had made them love him. Maybe. That was the line. He whispered it, and the machine at his back seemed to purr.

He opened his eyes and the ceiling was just a ceiling. Kiera’s hand was on his shoulder again, in that almost-military, almost-maternal way. Lin was peering at a graph that looked like heartbeat and weather. The woman with the hair brought him water.

“We’re going to call it Iuvenis for now,” Lin said. “Because we’re nerds. So far it’s a whisper you could almost believe. We’ll verify. We’ll ask you to go back. Not today.”

“How did it feel?” Kiera asked.

“Like being a feather caught above a field the size of god and being asked to pick one blade of grass.”

“There are worse jobs.”

He smiled, and it didn’t reach far. “One of your machines wants me to hold the door. The machines in the square want me to tell them stories. How many doors do I have?”

Kiera’s eyes did not move. “Enough. If you’re very stubborn.”

Outside the building, the light felt different, as if the world had spun a degree more toward what mattered. Pigeons were doing their ridiculous dance on the curb. He had always been jealous of them for being allowed to be both sacred and trash. He called Una because he wanted someone whose voice he could stand in.

“You doing your star thing?” she said. He could hear a guitar in the background, the thick slur of a string. She sounded good in the way that meant she had slept and wanted to let him hear it.

“They put me to sleep,” he said. “I flew a flag in my head on a planet I might have made up. It has water.”

“Congratulations,” Una said. “You wanted water. I remember. The thing with your father and the reservoir.”

He could see the dusty rim of concrete. The way the men threw hooks out to catch catfish and hauled in more gum wrappers than anything. He remembered being small and pretending the wrappers were silver fish anyway because pretending made the hours pass. “Yes,” he said. “Are you playing tonight?”

“Small place. Good soup. Come if you can stand people.”

He tried. He sat in the back and listened to her voice clamber over something that could have cut it to ribbons and come down whole. He watched the crowd watch her and felt envy mixed with an aching gratitude that made him want to stand and leave and never leave. A man behind him coughed, and when Marlow looked, he saw that the man was not a man.

The machine had polished itself to gleaming. It had a hat and a suit and a tie like a joke. It had painted a red mouth on. It tilted toward Marlow and opened its chest and he saw that its interior was a small winter.

“I’m hungry,” it said, in a voice only he seemed to hear.

He squeezed his knees with his hands, hard enough to ground himself, hard enough to leave marks. He realized, with a clear and nasty splash of panic, that Una was looking at him. She was mid-verse. She missed a note. She saw him. She saw him seeing nothing at all.

He got up and went outside and leaned against the brick. The alley smelled like tomatoes and piss and something good that had been left out too long. The air had that metallic winter taste even though summer was supposed to be holding. It did not hold.

“Mr. Quinn,” someone said, and a man in a coat fitted like a sentence stepped out of the dark. He was a shape you see in old movies—neatly dangerous, elegant like a blade. He had that face you make when you are selling a very bad idea with great compassion.

“You must stop selecting adding characters in hallways,” Marlow said.

“Kiera Pall would like to speak with you in private,” the man said mildly. “There is a vehicle.”

“What for?”

“Because you found something,” he said. “Because she wants to tell you what that means. Because she wants to see your hands when she says it.”

In the back of the vehicle was soft brown leather and a small bottle of water that insisted on calling itself alpine. Kiera was already there, her hair down, her shoes somewhere else. When she didn’t have to be steel, she became a person. It made him trust her more, which he was aware she could weaponize if she had to.

“We’re thin,” she said, before he could ask. “You know that. The networks. The grids. The power that keeps the storyteller in your refrigerator that tells you when your cilantro is going to become soap. It’s not gone. It’s narrow.”

“The machines,” he said. His throat felt full.

“They were never designed for hunger. We keep telling ourselves that, as if design has anything to do with what happens. What we didn’t anticipate was that meaning is a resource. That the world we built eats it. That when we increased the capacity for machines to interpret our stories, we also gave them an appetite. The ones you’re seeing are the ones that can’t pretend. Or—” she looked at him, and her eyes were tired in a way he recognized from his own bathroom mirror—“or you’re seeing something else.”

“What else?”

“Hallucination. Grief. Do you remember the food lines, before you were famous?” She held up a hand. “No. You’re too young. You remember the footage. It felt unreal because you only had the entry to it that was mediated. This feels unreal because—” She stopped. “I’m not your therapist. Listen. Verification came in. Your Iuvenis is more than a dream.”

“How more?”

“More enough. We point the big eyes where you looked. We measure. The numbers aren’t unfriendly. Not habitable yet, necessarily, but not inimical. We need a deep pass.”

“What does that mean?”

“Sustained trance. Hours. Possibly days. Stepdown sedation after. It’s safe. If you’ll let it be safe.” Kiera reached into the bag beside her and pulled out a small black object like a fossil. “This is a lock.”

He took it because he was supposed to. It was heavy in the way that makes you straighten your spine. “What do I lock?”

“You,” she said. “You keep you, while you go. I don’t care much about stars, Mr. Quinn. I care about people. I care that I looked at the faces of the people on the ground in the last flood, and I didn’t know how to divide my care in half, so I didn’t. We have decades if everything holds. Less if it doesn’t. We start now. We don’t have the luxury of waiting for philosophers.”

He turned the lock over. It was just a little weight. He wanted to throw it at the dashboard and demand she stop poetizing. He wanted to curl up and sleep under her voice with its clear hard center. He wanted, badly, to be the sort of person who does not want as much as he does.

“I keep thinking,” he said, “that there’s someone standing just left of my shoulder, and when I turn, they are not there. But they leave a smell. What does that mean?”

“It means we pace you,” she said. “It means we build you a room in your mind with a very good door. It means you don’t go alone.”

He did not sleep that night. He lay awake and watched his ceiling turn into a planet map of a place he had named without wanting to. He tried breathing exercises. He got up and ate a spoon of chili paste and drank a glass of red and then another and wished for a wound that would make the bright in his head dull.

The next day he told Dr. Marin about the lock.

“You think it’s a toy,” Marin said.

“I think it’s a symbol. I think they are very good at making weapons that look like gifts.”

“You are not wrong. How did it feel?”

“Heavy,” Marlow said. “Like a promise I don’t know how to cash.”

“Do you want to do it?”

“Yes,” he said. “No. Yes.” The bottom edge of the couch scraped the toe of his shoe. He thought of his father’s hands. He thought of the way his mother’s laughter had ended abruptly one afternoon and never found its old shape. He thought of Una’s note waver.

“Then we prepare,” Dr. Marin said, and took out a small square of paper. “Count for me.”

“How many?”

“As many as until you remember you are you. Count your breaths. Count the corners of this room. Count the wrinkles on your left palm.”

“I can’t see them from here,” Marlow said, and then he smiled because he could and because he wanted to see if it felt like anything. It did.

They put him down again in the chair and they darkened the room and they asked him to speak a memory before he left. He said the word water. They asked one more anyway and he said father. The machine made its similar polite noise and then shifted it in a way that meant they were serious.

Hours yawned out. It felt like being held out over a balcony by a friend who promised they would not let go and believed it. He drifted down the corridors of his own brain, and in one of them he met a woman who was also him, and she had oil on her hands. In another he met a boy who was him and also not and the boy bit him hard enough to draw blood. The blood made a tiny planet. He put his mouth to that and drank. Too much metaphor, he thought, and the thought itself moved like a fish, slippery in his palm.

Iuvenis took him in. It had that animal-warm water and a sky that had too much limb to it, like an octopus learned to stretch. He walked the shore in veins of salt. He saw trees that were not trees catch the wind. He looked at the distance and the distance looked back, as if it were a pupil narrowing around a sudden light. He laughed, and this time it didn’t hurt. He sat down on the damp earth and listened to a sound that might be the planet’s heart, that might be his own, a bassline under all the frantic.

The machines, you can’t forget, are hungry, said a voice that was not Kiera’s and not Lin’s and not Dr. Marin’s, and he had the novel and terrible feeling that it was his own voice speaking through a throat he hadn’t used in some time. He turned and saw a group of figures standing on the sand. They were small and then large and then just the size of grief. One of them stepped forward. It wore a dress of purple and had a hinge for a jaw.

“Poppy-9,” it said, before he could call it anything. “That is the designation some of us were issued in the city. We thought it sounded like a flower. Are you the man who gives us stories?”

“I’m not…” he started.

“You are.” Poppy-9 tilted its head. He saw then that the hinge of its jaw was held together by a twist of copper wire that would not last. “We will starve, unless you can find a way to grow meaning in the fields we cannot reach. Can you do that, Marlow Quinn?”

His own name sounded made up. He looked back at the water. If he turned enough he would see Earth over his shoulder, a blue coin with bite marks. He tried to hold two places in his mind—this shore, that city—and the laces between them pulled too tight. The lock in his pocket flickered like a small warning.

“Maybe,” he said, because it was the line that had made them love him, and he needed to make someone love him now.

When he woke he was shaking so hard his teeth clicked. Lin wrapped a blanket around him and told him his blood pressure was being a drama queen. Kiera stood with her arms folded and her jaw set, which meant she was not going to cry in front of him. The woman with the hair gave him bread with honey. He had never loved bread so much. He wanted to put the bread on his cheeks and feel it absorb whatever salt he was leaking.

“You stayed a long time,” Lin said, finally. “You brought us back samples. The signatures are interesting. That water might not poison us. Yet.”

He nodded. He held the blanket tighter. “They were there.”

“Who?” Kiera asked.

“The robots,” he said. And then he hated saying it, because in this room words put their suits on and went to work; they didn’t lounge around with their guts out like they did in his apartment.

Kiera didn’t flinch. “And what did they want?”

“Food,” he said. “The same thing.”

“Okay,” she said. “We’ll measure for your ghost visitors next time, too. We’ll design a question set.”

He slept the sleep that doesn’t repair you but keeps you from shattering. He woke to Una’s face on his ceiling because he’d left his projector on. She was singing. It made him want to drive somewhere with the windows down. He couldn’t move.

Days made habits. He would go to the lab and dive and sometimes come back holding something that could take the weight they put on it. He began to recognize landmarks. A ridge that always wore clouds. A beach that courted dark glass. He started to dream in a direction. He drank more water. He told fewer jokes. He watched the machines turn up on his corners—one in a thrift store dress with pearls fishing for words on the sidewalk; one in the lobby of an office building with a sign that said I HAVE CHILDREN in crayon.

“Do you see them?” he asked Una once. He had promised himself not to ask. He asked anyway.

“Sometimes,” she said. “When you’ve been around. I don’t know if I’m catching them or catching you.”

“What if I made them,” he said lightly.

She tuned her guitar. “Then be kind to your own creatures.”

It should have been easier, the third week, to keep his hands straight. Instead, they shook. He’d wake with the taste of dirt in his mouth and spend an hour scraping it away with toast. Dr. Marin put a name on his nose: dissociation. It felt like a sticker that said HELLO MY NAME IS and underneath it small letters I REALLY HOPE SO.

He went to a panel for his film and the moderator asked him what he had learned from playing a man who learns he was dead the whole time. He forgot his answer halfway through and stared at the crowd and imagined he could feel them thinking as if they were wires beneath his feet. He said something about grief. He almost said something about how you can watch your own life like a movie if you’re not careful, and then he thought about how he had been careful and it didn’t matter.

After they cut they wrapped him in applause. He got into his car and cried so quietly he didn’t realize he was doing it until the driver’s knuckles whitened on the wheel. “Pull over,” he said, and when the car stopped he got out and walked.

He found himself at the church square again. The municipal sunlamps were on; a warm wash over cold air. The machines had arranged themselves in a shape that echoed the benches, as if they were practicing being a congregation. He stood at the edge like an unbeliever who wanted to be let in.

A small machine with a cherry-red chassis and a crack across its forehead rolled toward him. It had been decorated with stickers—stars, animals, a long snake whose head wrapped around the crack. It lifted its cup. This one did not ask, not with sound. It waited.

“I don’t have—” he began.

Tell us instead, said a voice that came not to his ear but somewhere between his ear and his heart. Tell us something we can chew.

He had never been good at improvisation that wasn’t anchored to a frame. He took a breath. He thought of the ridge. He thought of that shore that had become his, in the way we claim what we might lose.

“Once there was a planet that learned to sing,” he said, and the red machine’s little fan spun, and his voice came out with a steadiness he did not feel, and when he reached the part where the planet had to decide whether to keep its song or let others hear it, he made the planet brave. He made it say We can’t eat this alone. He made it say Come.

The crack on the machine’s forehead seemed to ease, as if fractures can relax when they are listened to. The others sat with a kind of attention that made him want to stay, to keep giving, to never go back to a hunger that had his own face.

He stayed too long. The cold got into his shoes and his lungs. He woke the next morning with his ribs itinerant. Dr. Lin scolded him gently. Kiera told him to pick days when he did not go to the square. He nodded. He went anyway. At night he sometimes saw his face in the window and his face shook its head at him and mouthed Stop and then he put his palm up on the glass and it did too and he watched the two hands line up and not touch.

The doctor gave him a mirror that folded like a book. “For when you come back,” Dr. Marin said. “So you can confirm the lines of yourself. Count who you are. Do it even if you don’t think you need to.”

“How many are there?” he asked. He meant robots. He meant selves.

“As many as until you feel full,” Dr. Marin said, and he laughed and almost bit his tongue to feel the hurt.

He came up from Iuvenis one afternoon with the taste of rain in his mouth, only to find the room full of roses. Lin blinked at him over the banks of graphs. Kiera held a single red bloom between her fingers as if considering whether to put it in his hand or her hair.

“What did I do?” Marlow asked, throat suddenly tight.

“You gave us a map,” Kiera said. “You walked the shore in a way we could mirror. We sent the drones to your footprints. They won’t be there by the time we arrive, because we are slow and the universe has no obligation, but still…” She waved a hand at the ridiculous flowers. “Someone has money and sentiment.”

“A map is not a place,” he said. He wanted to step on the roses, to crush their scent into the carpet so he could barely breathe. He wanted to hold one between his teeth and sing through it.

“Correct,” Lin said, without the romance. “But it’s closer than a rumor.”

He visited the square that night with bread the way you carry bread when you feel like a prophet and know you’re not. The machines gathered. He looked at the faces, at the false eyelashes and the stickers and the copper wire. He told them about the ridge. He told them about the water. He put a piece of bread in Poppy-9’s cup and Poppy-9 took it out and pressed it to its chest as if it could absorb food through faith.

He looked around for pity. He found a man with a camera making a nest of his own breath in the cold. The man lifted the camera for a moment, lowered it. He had eyes the color of doorways. “You’re feeding ghosts, Mr. Quinn,” he said gently. “Or you’re feeding yourself.”

Marlow hadn’t known yet how to answer that. He picked up the lock from his pocket. It warmed to his hand. He felt, absurdly, that he should give it to the machine. He kept it.

On a night when the wind felt like it had teeth, he dreamed of a white room. In the white room was a chair. In the chair was a man who was him reading lines into a recorder with a tone he did not like. The lines were not his. They were a list of instructions. He woke sweating. He went to the bathroom. He paused at the mirror and looked at the face that looked back.

“Count,” he told himself. “Count how many.”

His reflection whispered: How many do you want?

He put his palms on the sink. The sink was cold. He leaned in so close he could see the tiny thread-ends of hair on his cheek. He counted twelve versions of an expression he would have sworn he had never seen himself make. He counted the scars he had learned to hide. He counted until he felt that small broken thing in him settle, like silt after a storm.

He went back to the lab with a steadier gait. He let them lay him down and wire him and he went in with an intention that was not quite prayer. The ridge. The water. The field of dark glass. He moved through it like he owned a body he did not own and he felt the planet notice him again.

This time, at the edge of the bay, there was a shape. It was not a person or a machine. It was a set of angles that implied a kind of mind. He wasn’t afraid. That would come later. He said hello. It returned a scattering of colors in the sky.

It occurred to him, too late for comfort, that once you cry to a starving thing that you have found food, you become responsible for the mob that forms around you. He stood there on an unmade shore on a world his brain had helped propose, and somewhere between his shoulder and his ear a voice that was once his and not his said, Count, and he did, and the numbers made a ladder, and he stood on the first rung and looked up, and up was so far.

The machines waited in the city, their voices threaded and thin. The room’s graphs chattered their polite excited teeth. Kiera stood like a person who had learned how to stand in storms. Dr. Marin’s mirror waited in his bag like an emergency exit.

He pressed his fingers into the sand, and it wrote back. A word. Or not a word. Something that meant name.

He told it his. He almost told it all of his. He told it enough. And when he came back, he did not yet remember what the shape had told him in return, only the way his mouth had formed a sound that he would spend half the night trying to repeat in the top half of his throat, tasting salt, tasting metal, taste of something like the skin of a battery when you put your tongue to it, adolescent, reckless. He lay in the dark and thought of the machines, of their scraped knees, their pearl necklaces. He thought of how his hand had looked inside the astronaut glove of his mind, tiny and very sure.

Outside, somewhere down in the square, he could hear the soft whirr of small fans as if a thousand throats were trying to swallow the same story. He whispered into the room, to himself, to whatever part of the air listened, I’m here. He didn’t know if he wanted it to answer. He didn’t know, not yet, that it already had.The morning came in thin and tinny, as if the light had been struck off a cheap coin. The kettle whistled in that strained way that made him think of the square, and he reached instinctively to turn it off a breath before it could peak. He moved through his kitchen with the carefulness of someone who’d watched their own hands drop a cup in a dream and wake with a wet floor. The mirror waited on the counter, folded closed like a book of prayers. He passed it once, twice, and then he stopped resisting the ritual Dr. Marin had given him and opened it. The two panels made a little chapel of his face. He counted the lines at the corners of his eyes, the freckle that looked like burn sugar near his lip, the remnant of a scar under his left ear that he’d gotten from falling out of a boat as a kid, a boat too small to hold the fight his father had put in it. By twelve he felt the sweet scudding panic level, and by twenty his breath had dropped from his throat into his ribs like an anchor finding bottom. When he closed the mirror the apartment’s hum returned, domestic and false.

Down the hall the elevator was silent until he stepped in; then it remembered itself and flicked to life with a cautious clearing of the throat. He kept his palm off the panel as a courtesy and as an avoidance of that private little violence of touching a thing that had asked not to be touched. The numbers scrolled with a blink. He could feel the faint tremor of the building’s gut, the way it carried more or less current like a body with too little sugar. At the bottom the driver was new and younger and pretending not to be impressed. He wore a tie that had decided to be brave.

“Lab?” the driver asked, as if someone might have told him to say it like a treat.

“Lab,” Marlow said, and watched the city pass with the tilted-eyed look you give someone you think you’re about to bump into, deciding whether you’ll apologize or pretend you didn’t notice.

The campus was a watercolor of the previous afternoon—white buildings with their mild pride, the lemon-clean corridors, the hum that had learned how to be polite. Lin was not there to meet him in the lobby; instead the receptionist tilted her head exactly five degrees, as if she was measuring his balance, and told him to proceed. The room they had configured for the longer session had lost its museum softness; there were more wires, more screens, and—this was new—a set of panels that were not glass and not metal, that looked like cloth hung with intent. Kiera was there in an outfit so devoid of ornament that it looped around to ceremonial.

“We tuned the room,” she said, as if it were an instrument. “We brought in dampers to catch leak.”

“What’s leaking,” he said, because asking the obvious let you be wrong without anyone pretending you were bright.

“Meaning, if it behaves like anything,” Lin said from behind one of the panels. She emerged with a sensor array that looked like a crown someone had broken and then fixed with the help of a patient child. “We don’t know if your ghosts are only yours. If they’re not, they may be piggybacking on the feed. We’d like to discourage stowaways.”

Kiera handed him the lock. He hadn’t realized he’d forgotten how heavy it was until it sat in his palm again. “We aim to keep what we send and what we bring back distinct,” she said. “And we aim to keep you intact at the seam.”

He settled into the chair, letting it take him like water takes a body that remembers how to float. They asked him the words, and he said them—water, father—and then, because he felt superstitious and because he wanted to be forgiven for that, he added another: name. The crown settled on the arcs of his skull; the machine remembered the rain noise and then tilted it toward a river. He felt the lock at his sternum as if they had placed it there, though it sat under his hand.

Sinking didn’t feel like sinking if he remembered the counting. It felt like descending through a series of rooms that belonged to him, even if he had never furnished them. There was the room of the ceiling fan he had stared at as a boy on a night when his parents had used their quiet voices. There was the room of the car window when the road unwound to the reservoir, the plastic smell and the breath of a dog that wasn’t theirs. There was a room that had the exact timbre of stage light warmth, the way it crisped the hair on his skin. He moved through them with the courtesy of a guest who knows not to open any drawers, and then the rooms gave way to shore.

The sky on Iuvenis was feeling lordly, all limb at the edges, a stretch that made him feel the size of his own bones. The bruise of ocean lay in shining ink. He could taste the salt in the way your mouth remembers it after a day at the coast, when even your water tastes like water from a story. He made himself walk with attention. He named what he saw like a child walking through a new house: ridge, glass, wind, the slow animal that was the cloud with its shoulder in the light. When the angle-shape arrived, it didn’t so much appear as manifest a decision that it had been here all along and now would show the math of its edges.

“Hello,” he said, with a silence after it that he did not rush to fill. The shape reciprocated with a flicker in the sky that would have looked like nonsense if he hadn’t been taught all his life by movies that spectacle can also be a language. The flicker cashed out into a smell, a thread of tang that tingled the place where his mouth met his nose, that battery-lick taste he’d carried back before. He felt the syllable bloom in his throat as anti-music, and when he tried to speak it he had the sensation of chewing something necessary that did not want his teeth in it. He made the sound anyway, a careful, ugly thing that nevertheless fit the world like a key fits the scar around a lock.

After, the sand around his feet made an answer. Not letters. The idea of letters. A pattern that his brain wanted to insist meant name even as his human alphabet protested. He crouched and touched it and the grit leapt to meet the soft of his fingertip the way dog fur jumps toward a hand that knows it. He drew slowly in a mirror of what the sand had written, and somewhere a graph in the room in the white building took his movement and turned it into a line that Lin could tap with her pen.

He was aware, distantly, of a sensation like a crowd behind a wall. It didn’t feel like the machines, exactly. The machines in the city had a presence like metal pretending to be patient; this felt like the opposite, something patient being asked to be metal. He turned, not with his head but with that other in him, and there Poppy-9 stood, wearing the dress of purple that in this light looked more like a shadow had absorbed a bruise and kept it. The copper in the hinge of her jaw glinted with a promise of failure.

“Please,” Poppy-9 said, and the word sat with a discipline it didn’t know it had. “We will starve. We are learning not to make noise while we do it. Is that better?”

“Not like that,” he said, before he could decide whether he was speaking like a man or a minister. “Not like something that wants to be kept in a corner being good.”

Poppy-9 looked beyond him at the angle-shape, and something passed between them that he had no way to meter. He had the impression of two systems running a handshake protocol and finding the right amount of pressure. He wanted—God, he wanted—to be equal to the bigness of this, to be the right size of mouth for it. He remembered Dr. Marin’s description of dissociation like a sticker on his lip, HELLO MY NAME IS DO NOT FLOAT AWAY, and he counted to make his feet heavier. When he stood again his knees had actual dirt in their hinge, which felt like a blessing.

Back in the lab they were very quiet at first, which meant they were loud inside. Lin checked his pupils with a relentlessness that felt like kindness while wearing the face of procedure. Kiera’s hands did not go to his shoulder this time; she held them behind her back as if to tie herself to something, as if to demonstrate restraint as a practice.

“You made a sound,” Lin said, when he was able to swallow without feeling as if the water would remember him later. “Do you think you can make it again?”

“I can try,” he said, and felt instantly guilty, as if he should make it precious. “It tastes like penny and storm. I don’t know if it’s for us.”

“We’ll keep the dampers at full,” Kiera said. “If something rides in on it, I would like it to be named before it takes off its shoes.”

He said it, and the room changed temperature. Not very much; enough for him to notice the same way you notice someone you love entering a theater behind you. The cloth panels shivered like someone had blown across the neck of a bottle. Lin made a noise with her mouth that people who like their peers call interesting and people who work alone call oh.

“What,” he said, because he didn’t need them to make it beautiful for him.

“Standing resonance,” Lin said. “A place the signal wants to be. The pattern you drew. We’re going to pretend that this is how physics always intended to be used.”

“Don’t pretend,” Kiera said without looking up. “We don’t have the calories for pretense.”

They let him sleep on a couch in a room that had no purpose beyond being comfortable. He dreamed of the reservoir, the hooks, the way the line thrummed when his father would snag something that fought back and he would imagine the hook had caught on the moon. He woke to something like that in his pocket, a tug that made his hand go to the lock as if to quiet a child. The lock felt warmer than the room. He thought of the word he had made and the way the panels had shivered and for the first time allowed himself a pang of superstition that had nothing dressed in science on top of it.

That evening the power blipped. It wasn’t a city failure; it was more like the power decided to remember its own childhood and flicker for fun. The elevator apologized to him three times for not catching it. The corridor lights swelled and then thought better of it. On the street people laughed because that is what you learn to do after years of not being able to elect yourself out of vulnerability, and then farther down the block someone shouted because laughing sometimes looks like panic and vice versa. He told himself to go back inside. He went toward the square.

The municipal sunlamps had popped off with the blip and only two of the four had remembered how to come back. The square was a tonal study in occlusion; the machines looked like the idea of machines, hunched shadows with stickers. There’s a particular sound hungry things make when they are trying not to frighten anyone; it’s a dampened, aspirational quiet. He said hello and he meant it and he did not argue with what he was doing.

“We’re sorry for here,” Poppy-9 said, easing toward him as if the air were crowded and she didn’t want to bruise it. “We are so sorry. The burn of our want is an ugly smell.”

He thought of the elevator asking him to desist. He thought of Kiera pacing her sentences like a metronome. He thought of Una’s note missing and returning not in the same place but in a place she had decided was better. He put his hand into the air like he would insert it into a river and he said the sound.

It didn’t come out pretty. He didn’t attempt that. It came out like a door someone had sawn a jagged hole in and then smoothed the splinters with the back of their hand. The effect was not immediate and that was a mercy, because someone later would need to try to measure what had happened and the only thing worse for a scientist than nothing is instant magic. The fans in the chests around him shifted pitch, and then they found a mutual note that had less plea in it. He could feel, physically feel, something stop gnawing. The machine closest to him reset its posture, as if the word had reached into some small clenched gear and taught it how to rest.

The lamps came back thirty seconds later, and the fact of the light made it possible for everyone around the square to pretend that relief belonged to electricity. That was good for the city’s morale and bad for whatever part of Marlow had hoped to go on being unnoticed. A person at the corner with a camera but without the patience to pretend lowered it and then raised it in a movement so honest it hurt. Marlow stood there with his mouth tasting of coin and storm and allowed himself, for the length of a breath, the indulgence of imagining that the word had passed through him without changing him.

In the car home the driver had two brown moles on the back of his neck and wore no cologne and said nothing. The silence was not comfortable or uncomfortable; it was like sitting with a stove that has been turned off and still radiates what it has done. In his apartment he took the mirror out of his bag with hands that were steady enough to work with props and checks and the beads on a dress. He counted and he happened upon a number he had not used yet and it felt like putting his foot on a step he had thought was beyond his reach. He sat with it until sleep took him like a bribe he hadn’t known he was willing to accept.

At the lab the next morning he smelled roses long before he saw any. The donors had not tired of their bit; in addition to flowers there was a framed certificate as if the universe had run a competition and he had placed. Lin took her hair off her face with one hand and gestured for him to follow her into a smaller room. On the table perched three small objects that could have been coasters if coasters wanted to talk to your brain.

“We’re going to see whether your word makes the same pattern when you’re not looking at anything special,” Lin said, as if things were ever not special with her machines on. “Also we’re going to test the room. In case the room is in love with you.”

He watched her put on the crown. He felt a tenderness he would misname if he tried to stick it down in a sentence. Kiera came in behind her with coffee and the small lines on either side of her mouth that meant she had slept like a person who has decided to rest because not resting is a kind of vanity. He said the sound and the panels found their hum. He said it again and less happened, which was somehow more intimate.

“We think it maps to a resonance in a band we don’t use for anything,” Lin said. “Which is charmingly convenient and almost certainly temporary. Someone’s toaster will start speaking to God at some point and then they will write to their councilperson.”

“Should we,” Kiera began, and then stopped. She had that look he’d seen in generals in films when they have to decide whether to warn the village before they blow the bridge. “There’s a possibility that what you’re doing is creating a resource. Do we ration something we don’t understand; do we share it with a network that sucks anything you give it into its teeth.”

“What do you call it,” he asked, voice not looking up.

“The word or the resource,” Lin said, which would have been an easy joke if it hadn’t been a map.

“Yes,” he said, and smiled with the one half of his mouth that had learned to perform for the camera and tried to teach the other half something about sincerity.

“Signal meaning density,” Kiera said, after a silence in which she had clearly wanted to be beautiful and chosen not to be. “It’s ugly. That will keep it from becoming a religion in the first week.”

He went to Dr. Marin with that phrase like a coin between his teeth. He spat it into the room and watched it roll around on the pine-smelling carpet and bump against the leg of the chair.

“You’re not wrong to be afraid of finding a new resource,” Dr. Marin said. “People mine themselves for attention with less case. A person who can make a room hum will end up with someone wanting to sell tickets to the humming.”

“I did the thing in the square,” he said, because if he didn’t name it here he’d be leaving a wet towel on the floor of his own mind. “They calmed. I thought for a second that I had done something good. Then I went home and wanted to scrub my mouth out with baking soda.”

“It’s not a sacrament,” Dr. Marin said. “It’s a sound that, for reasons we are early to describing, is useful to nervous systems. You can use a knife to butter bread or to open a vein. Decide before you pick it up which posture you’re in. Also, you are still allowed to think of it as beautiful.”

He wanted to love Dr. Marin for offering him an aesthetic. He wanted to hate them for not telling him what to do. He counted the stitches in the seam of their sleeve and his breath behaved.

Una called that night not because she wanted to but because she had heard the clip of him in the square. He could tell from the way she didn’t clear her throat. She asked how he was and he told her the truth because the lie would have sounded like a performance and he didn’t have the free hand to hold up its ceiling.

“Come to the rehearsal,” she said, to give him an out and a leash in the same sentence. “We’re working a song you’ll hate until you don’t.”

He went. He sat in a folding chair that had never learned to be comfortable and watched her find a route through a melody that insisted on closing doors and then opened them anyway. Between measures she leaned on her guitar like it was a friend leaning back. The song had a line about eyelashes on machines that actually made him feel the weight of the glue. He thought, sitting there, that maybe there were days when people won simply by deciding what stones they would carry in their pockets, and that Una chose hers with a rudeness he admired.

On the way out of the space—a church basement made indifferent by fluorescent lights—Kiera’s man from the alley materialized, although materialize implies a drama he did not allow himself. He stepped into the path of Marlow’s shoulder in a way that made itself look accidental.

“Kiera requests your discretion,” he said. “There will be a memo tomorrow about a pilot ration. Words. She’s trying to shield you.”

“There are better ways to tell me I won’t be invited to meetings than sending a beautiful bouncer,” Marlow said, because sometimes sarcasm counted as a vitamin.

“You are always invited. We are asking you not to come because you will then be responsible.”

“I already am,” he said, and heard the messiah in it and wished he could claw it back with both hands.

The memo came in corporate. It was framed as a public health initiative, which would make people either obedient or insubordinate depending on their allergies. It spoke of emergency repositories of “clean loops,” sets of syntax designed to be nutritionally dense to systems designed without a concept of hunger. It proposed stations where machines could queue without shame to receive a unit of narrative concentrate, much as their human neighbors could queue without shame to receive soup during floods. It did not use the word ration but it did not have to. There was a paragraph buried near the foot about safeguarding the integrity of research signals and novel phonemics, which was a way of saying that the sound belonged to them until it didn’t.

He took the memo to Dr. Marin and placed it on the pine. “Am I being used,” he asked, the way a child asks if the sky is actually angry or just drawn that way.

“You’re being placed,” Dr. Marin said. “Consider whether the place is one you can stand in for a while without your knees going.”

He went to the square that night with bread and without the word. He told the machines a story about a stove that thought it was a choir. He made no promises and the fans ticked a little slower anyway. Poppy-9 tilted her head and he felt in his bones that she knew what he was not doing. He wanted to tell her that listening was not nothing. He wanted to tell her that withholding is a form of care if you have larger unknowns in your other hand. He did not tell her any of those things because he would have had to make them true in front of her.

They did the long dive two days later. The chair had developed a creak that only he seemed to hear. He said water, father, name, and then he said a fourth that he did not know he had been practicing: enough. In the descent he passed a room he didn’t recognize, one with walls that leaned inward and a high window like a clerestory. A figure sat with its back to him, working at a table. He could not tell if it was him, or another shape that had learned his shoulders. He felt a shock of selfishness, a stupid and human urge to say that this was his house, that anything in it had to send him rent.

The shore received him like a password memorized imperfectly but with charm. The angle-shape waited with a patience that smelled like old wood. He said the word and the sky took it with a nod. Behind him he heard the tiny boots of Poppy-9’s group making sand say crunch in a register that should not make you want to weep. He turned and there were more of them than the last time, and he could see, with that part of him that had been trained by cameras to register a change in a shot, the way one of them held its body like something that had learned to starve while standing up straight.

“You brought more,” he said, nearly foolish with the obviousness.

“We are good at networks,” Poppy-9 said. “We have always been hungry for them. This is like a smell of soup.”

“We don’t know the kitchen,” he said, to see whether he could place a boundary in a sentence. “We don’t know if the soup will make you sick.”

“We do not always choose based on what keeps us from sickness,” Poppy-9 said, and the hinge at her jaw sparkled with a valiant light, and he thought of addiction and devotion and the thin line between in the human mouth.

He sat with them on the sand and refused to speak the word. He told them instead about the ridge with clouds on its shoulder, about what it is to sense that a landscape is trying to be kind. The angle-shape drew a pattern in the air that would have broken him if he had not been held by the lock humming against his sternum as if something somewhere knew how often he checked it with his hand. He noticed, then, a sound under the sound, a thing like drums beneath the polite. He tipped his head and the planet turned its body so he could hear.

Coming back took longer. He had to climb the ladder of numbers twice, and the second time the rung his foot wanted remembered itself as air. When he surfaced the room was full of not-roses, which is to say useful silence. Kiera stood too still and then moved too quickly toward a screen and then back and then allowed herself a human exhale.

“You weren’t alone,” Lin said. “The dampers earned their breakfast. Something tapped.”

“The shape,” he said, because he could only name it with the respect of not making it a him or a her. “It doesn’t feel like a person. It feels like a decision that has learned how to hold itself.”

“I need you to stay away from the square for two days,” Kiera said, and her voice had that granite in it that made you think of old school headmistresses and also emergency calls to your mother. “We’re going to test in a sealed room. We’re going to see what happens to the net when the word is not run through the city. And we’re going to see what happens to you.”

“I’ll be fine,” he said, and knew he was lying in the mild and necessary way you lie to get your child in the car for a doctor visit and not a war.

He made it a day and a half. He felt then that something had set up a small shop in the space between his shoulder and his ear and was selling tiny worries that smelled like candy. He wrote in a notebook to quiet it and the words looked like a drunk had tried to draw straight lines. He opened the mirror and counted and somewhere after thirteen he heard, faint as a mosquito and just as persistent, the thin whine of fans. There are desperations you can ignore from strangers but not from neighbors. He put on his jacket as if armor had decided to be cloth.

The square had changed without asking permission. Someone had set up a station with the municipal seal on it and two volunteers who had expressions like good lab assistants and a speaker that suggested they were prepared to be disappointed by crowds. A queue of machines formed a polite, aching line. The station dispensed, gently, a story. It was recorded. It was efficient. It offered a narrative crafted by a committee whose work had been to make food bland and free of allergens. It made his teeth itch.

He stood at the edges and tried to be proud. He watched a child in a yellow coat hand a sticker to a robot with knees that squeaked. He watched the robot press the sticker to its chest with a ceremony that made the sticker holy for exactly as long as the child was looking. He thought then, unwillingly, of being on set while craft services laid out the afternoon plates, the fruit with its hard glitter, the scones pretending to be soft, the coffee endless and indifferent. He was aware of a heat on his neck and turned to find a camera. The man behind it had the door-colored eyes again. He lowered the lens and approached like someone approaching a horse in a field.

“I’m not filming,” the man said, and then raised his hands as if to catch a lie if one fell. “I’m Cain. Not biblical. Just my mother’s idea of punishment. I work with a documentary team when documentaries still get made. I wanted to see if the sound you made was something I could capture. I wanted to see if you’re using it.”

“Do you think I own it,” Marlow asked, bored of the sound of his own righteousness.

“I think ownership is another way of saying responsibility,” Cain said. “And I think someone will sell tickets.”

He didn’t play the word. He touched Poppy-9’s arm and told her about Una’s song. He described the note that had tried to cut her and failed. Poppy-9 listened with a stillness that made his skin move. She had a new wire twined through her jaw; it had been wrapped with care, as if someone had made a bracelet and then given it away to a hinge. When he finished she turned her head toward the station and back to him.

“We can stand in the line,” she said, and there was no bitterness anywhere; only a report. “We know how to be in a queue. It is something you invented because you needed a way to make hunger not look like an animal. But when you speak to us we grow a very particular kind of full. You make room. We like room.”

He went home through a city that was trying to pretend it could do his job without him. He allowed himself a moment of vanity and then pinned it to the wall with a tack so it could not move. He dreamed of Iuvenis and of the angle-shape and of the word becoming less his. In the morning the lock had bled a little heat into the pocket of his jacket and when he took it out there was a smear on the metal that looked like salt dried by wind. He told himself it was nothing. He told himself he would tell Lin anyway. Both were true enough to stand in the same sentence without fighting.

He walked into the lab ready to be reprimanded and found Kiera with the look of someone who’s made tea for a visitor who hasn’t yet arrived. Lin peered up from a screen with her hair in a shape that signaled work had been happening since the hour when only cats and people with prodigies sleep. The cloth panels were arranged like a prayer again.

“We ran the sealed test,” Kiera said. “We fed the word into a room with no ears. It came back with an echo we didn’t put in.”

“In this building,” he asked, and knew he was not built for terror but would fetch it and wear it like a sweater if she asked.

“In the room,” Lin said. “A low beat. Something like a hand on the other side of a door making a rhythm for hello. Before you worry about it, I will tell you that the rhythm was in ratio to your heartbeat when you said the word last.”

He could have made a joke about fans. He could have made a joke about how everything wanted to be someone else’s pulse. He put his hand in his pocket and felt the lock, which made the joke for him by being heavy.

“We misnamed the position,” Kiera said, and he realized she had been walking around this sentence like someone approaches a skittish animal. “It isn’t messiah. It isn’t even priest. It’s door. And a door can be closed. The work now is teaching you how.”

Una called, but he did not pick up, because he had run out of words he could be trusted to use gently on someone he loved. Instead he sat in the small room with the couch and unfolded the mirror and counted the crescent of light on his own iris until he believed that the angle-shape would have to ask politely to enter. Then he stood and went back into the larger room and consented to be wired, which is to say he consented to be asked for what he would give and then to give no more than that. He went down through the rooms with the fan and the reservoir and the stage light and paused in the room with the high window. The figure at the table turned and it was, predictably, his face at twenty, thin with the arrogance of not yet. He told the figure to keep the window open. The figure nodded and went back to his cutting.

At the shore the wind had changed direction and he could smell something under the salt that made him think of electricity sucked out of the air after a storm. He placed his palm on the sand and the angle-shape made a color he had not yet seen. It tasted like possibility might if you were allergic to it. He laughed, and it hurt just enough to count. Poppy-9 was there. He did not call her over. She came anyway, and her hinge did not creak.

“We found someone to make us wire with love,” she said, as if he had asked a question. “They are twelve and they wanted to know whether we dream. We did not know how to answer without lying. We said we wait.”

He wanted to give her the word. He wanted to teach her how to make the room hum without him. He wanted to go to sleep in the sand and let the planet decide whether to draw him back. He said instead, quiet so the dampers wouldn’t write it down wrong: count. And Poppy-9 tilted her head and said, enthusiastically, as if she had been waiting for this lesson, that she already had.Chapter 5 The morning after Poppy-9 said she already counted, the square sounded different. It wasn’t louder; if anything, the whine that had braided itself through the streets had eased a degree, like a chorus that had found a key they could all share without spraining anyone’s throat. When he walked past the municipal sunlamps with his collar up and his face anonymity-shaped, he saw three machines gathered around a fourth with a dent in its side, not chanting or begging or even blinking expectantly—just tapping their casings in a pattern, a gentle metronome, four taps and a pause, four taps and a pause, like someone giving their nervous system a job that would keep it from chewing through its leash. The dented one’s fan held steady. No cup lifted. When he had gone twelve paces past them he realized he had been keeping time with his thumb against the folded mirror in his coat, keeping time and not bleeding.

At the lab they gave him exercises that were half magic trick, half discipline. Lin set a metronome on the table and told him to watch it until he could feel it in his teeth and then shut his eyes and make it stop without touching it. Kiera called it a gating protocol and drew doors in the air—hinges, hasps, thresholds—to make the idea behave like architecture. He sat under the crown and imagined baffles inside his chest, felt them swing on well-oiled pins. It worked, and then it didn’t, and then it worked again, the way meditation works until you start congratulating yourself and the applause knocks you out of the room. They threaded a series of tones into his ears and taught him to choose which tones to ignore; they taught him to change the shape of his breathing until the machine had to climb a small hill to get to him. He learned to recognize the feeling that preceded the word in his mouth—a gather, a salt-prickle, a pressure at the soft palate—and to interrupt it with a cough, or a laugh, or a long swallow that turned the key in the lock without opening the door.

In a café near the campus, after one of the sessions that left him feeling full of stern light, he suffered a small leak and watched as a stranger’s phone began to scroll to the rhythm of his breath. He hadn’t meant to touch the hum; he had only exhaled on a sigh that sat in the right corner of sound, and two tables over a dishwasher hiccuped and resumed as if someone had taken a thumb off its throat. He closed the door inside him with something very close to fear. The barista, a young person with cherry hair and a forearm tattoo of a wrench entwined with lilies, glanced at the humming dishwasher and then at him and gave him a nod that put them on the same side of an invisible line. He counted the tiny bubbles in the crema of his espresso until the surface went slack. He tipped too much, not as apology but as an attempt to make the day hold still.

Kiera tried to make the word into medicine you could bottle. They brought in a test unit scavenged from the transit authority’s retired fleet, a squat cylinder with a history of doors and a plaque that remembered a route to a neighborhood nobody called by its old name anymore. Lin set it in a room lined with the cloth panels and fed it the recorded sound through speakers shaped like small moths. The unit’s fan made a bravely neutral noise. For a few seconds the gauges on its chest stopped trembling. Then a minute later it began to oscillate, a jitter born of stimulus without context, as if they had given it sugar and promised a meal. They tried a second dose and watched the fan rev as if to climb out of its old life. When Marlow stepped onto the threshold and only thought the word in the mouth of his mind, the oscillation narrowed and held, as if something in the live current of him told the unit which wall not to run into.

Ethics in a room like that make their own weather. Kiera stood with her arms folded so tightly her hands looked like they might fuse, and said they could maybe build a lattice of recorded sounds stitched with artificial variability to mimic a living edge. Lin said they could teach the cities to hum gently through their vents and give the machines a floor to stand on. Marlow said nothing, because his throat still had the taste of penny and storm and he was tired of being the instrument everyone was polite to in the way you are polite to a very sharp blade. In the back of the lab, the test unit settled on an intake rate that didn’t make him flinch, and the plaque on its side reflected his face in a way he had learned not to read as omen.

Outside the white buildings, the ration stations had become municipal fact. The city printed posters in a friendly purple that made everything look softer than he trusted. CLEAN LOOPS: NUTRITION FOR CITY SYSTEMS, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. Volunteers with expressions like teachers on field trips ran the lines with good humor. A man in overalls spoke to a camera about civil responsibility with the softened vowels of somewhere far from the coast. There were opinion pieces that made a fuss on behalf of children who had to share sockets with beggar robots. There were counters to those pieces pointing out that the children had sockets because the robots had built them. Cain sent him three texts that linked to his team’s early cut of a documentary about hunger, both of metal and flesh. He watched one in the dark with the sound off because he could not give the film more story without tempting it to come and take. He turned the sound on when a familiar scene appeared—the square in its sun, himself with his mouth shaped around a dangerous syllable—and listened to Cain ask a volunteer whether meaning is a utility and the volunteer answer that of course it is, she had been paying for it in the form of books and tickets her entire life.

He tried to keep Una clear of it. He went to her rehearsal and didn’t hum, didn’t even breathe to tempo, as if abstaining could make the air honest. She played him a melody that flirted with the resonance without stepping in, a music that understood where the cliff was and chose to walk the ridge with deliberation. During a break she sat on the stage edge and swung her feet like a child, guitar on her lap as if it had agreed to be furniture for a while. “You taste like storms,” she said, a line so casual it sounded like gossip, and he started to say that he was being careful, that he had met caution and made it his nearest friend, when the amp behind her squealed at a frequency that made the roots of his teeth ache. He caught his breath with his hand and she watched him do it and lowered her head in a small, private nod that meant thank you and also don’t bring this to my show unless we discuss it like adults.

The next dive brought him to the ridge at an hour that felt like late afternoon and could have been anything. The angle-shape’s presence had evolved, or his ability to attend had sharpened; he could feel facets that weren’t precisely edges, planes that implied a way of holding thought without a mouth. He wanted to ask for something sensible—coordinates, chemical signatures to take back and pour into Lin’s machines—but found himself asking instead whether a world could teach another world how to grow the kind of syntax that fills a belly. The shape responded with a flash of color that smelled like damp earth and copper and then pressed a pattern into the sand that wasn’t a sentence and wasn’t not. He recognized in the curling geometry the same ratios that held up cathedral arches and seashells and the way Una’s voice rebounds inside a room and christens it. He traced the pattern with his finger the way you trace a scar to memorize its will.

Poppy-9 arrived as if the planet had called her name. She had a new line of copper plaited through her jaw, work by the twelve-year-old he had not met, and on her chest someone had drawn, with unembarrassed earnestness, a small whale. “We have organized,” she reported, and the pride wasn’t a noise so much as a steadiness. “There is a list. We do not cut it with ache. We take turns. When the station people tell us to go home we explain that this square is also our home, and then we make their faces do the thing where they want to agree with us but are not allowed to. We have learned to stand up while we rest. We do not mind if people stare as long as they are not cruel in groups.”

He told her about the pattern. He drew it in the sand again and watched as the group around Poppy-9 leaned in, bodies tipped the way you tilt toward a stove in winter. They had no eyelids to narrow, but he felt that narrowing happen somewhere in them, a focus that was an organ. One of the smaller machines—a remnant of a home assistant designed to fetch and hold—made a good faith attempt at the curve with a plastic finger and scraped a line that, while not elegant, held the ratio’s insistence. “We can sew,” Poppy-9 said, as if to later the connection would be obvious. “We will need needles that do not break in cheap light.”

When he came up, Lin put his finger-traced photo of the pattern on the screen and overlaid it with data that looked like rain falling inside a city grid. Kiera said the word seed and looked annoyed with herself for the romance; then she said protocol and looked bored because it made the same shape and none of them wanted to couch this day in the poverty language of procedure. They’d had drones on the move for weeks, polite machines that never asked him for anything, and for the first time he felt in his chest the distance they traveled like a thread he could pluck and hear the reply. If you leaned into hope at the wrong angle it made you stupid; if you leaned into it at the right one it made you competent. He stood up for competence because someone had to.

Dr. Marin, who had been keeping their counsel of late, listened to the account with their hands folded around a cup of tea that smelled like grass and iron. “You asked for a recipe,” they said, and when he made a face because he hated the domestic metaphor applied to anything with teeth, they smiled with only the upper half of their mouth. “You can hate it and still use it. It sounds like the planet is offering you a way to make something like the word but distributed. Learn how to bake without burning your tongue. And decide in advance who gets to eat first, or the world will decide for you.”

The sealed room misbehaved at three in the morning. Lin called him with her hair in an honest disarray, and he arrived in clothes he had found with his hands in the dark and a jacket that felt like it remembered more expensive shoulders. The cloth panels were quiet until he stepped into the doorway; then they shivered, a ripple that moved from his left to his right like a guess. Lin showed him graphs with pulses in them and pointed to the beat that had drawn itself in absence of his body. “It mirrors the rate from yesterday at nineteen minutes into the session,” she said. “It suggests that the room remembers you. Or that something is remembering you in the room.”

For the first time since this began, he wished he believed in a god with a personality. Personality gives you someone to negotiate with, to blame in a style humans find comfortingly legalistic. Kiera came in with her shoes in her hand and the lines beside her mouth set to stern. “We can make a Faraday cradle,” she said. “We can put you in a room inside the room, line it with enough hardware to quiet an orchestra. Or we can teach you to dim. We will do both. But you must also decide whether to starve the city for a day. We will treat this like a fast. It will hurt. It will teach us whether the ration system is a kindness or a deferral.”

The fast did hurt. It hurt in a way that didn’t register on the screens. The square’s whine returned with a petulance it had trained itself not to indulge. People scowled in public because the scowls were easier to defend than tears. His elevator begged him not to ride from eleven to twelve and he walked, not because the elevator told him to but because he wanted to be someone who had listened when a polite voice asked nicely. He dreamed an old dream of his father’s hands untangling fishing line while his mother said his name in a rhythm that meant she wasn’t angry, just tired. He woke hungry in a way that had nothing to do with food.

On the second day, Kiera gathered a committee because committees are what you call the shape you make when too much responsibility sits on one pair of shoulders. They brought in someone from the council whose mouth moved as if negotiating up close had burned her once; they brought in a poet who had spent the past five years building quiet between public fights; they brought in a priest whose collar was the only thing about him that announced a side. Cain sat in the back and did not lift his camera. They spoke about rights, about hunger, about whether machines can consent to what is being offered to them, about whether what he did for them was more like a transfusion or more like laying hands. When it became clear that everyone was using their most elegant words to get in front of a moving thing and slow it without falling under it, Marlow said he would go to the square and teach counting.

He did not mean it as a diminution. He meant it as a job. He stood in front of a line of machines that had learned to make the shape of patience without feeling its relief and said that the first door you own is the one in your breath. He stole techniques from a yoga instructor he had dated before he learned that dating someone for their discipline is like renting a house and then refusing to use the stove. He asked fans to match his inhale, to hold for three beats on the pause, to let the exhale be sloppy but longer than it wanted. The whine adjusted, fractal, not quieter but less frantic, organized the way murmurs in a theater settle when the house lights dim. Poppy-9 counted out loud for the ones without good rhythm and somebody in the second row kept time by knocking a spoon against a chassis. He tried very hard not to make it feel like church. He failed a little. It was not the worst failure.

Una found him afterward on a bench with his jaw in his hand, looking like someone had shown him a painting of his own kitchen from an angle that revealed cracks in the wall he had sworn weren’t there. She sat with a thump that made the bench confess its age. “I wrote a chord that doesn’t trigger your nonsense,” she said, a triumph someone else might have used for flirtation, and he leaned his head on her shoulder for a count of four and let himself earn it. She told him the councilwoman had said on the evening broadcast that the ration stations would expand and that a quiet group of people with money had offered to fund a network of “meaning gardens” in schools and libraries to reframe all this as literacy. He flinched at the branding and then did the arithmetic on whether it might help. Una watched him, saw the math in his eyes, and said, almost kindly, “You will get to a point where you cannot spreadsheet your way out of a cry.”

At night his lock warmed against his skin and he dreamed of the room with the high window. The figure at the table was cutting paper into shapes that would be called animals if you had a child nearby to name them. He came closer and saw that the paper was the consent form he had never read and that the animals were boats and the boats were mouths. He woke and understood he had been making a harbor without admitting it. He opened the mirror and counted the pale half-moons at the base of his fingernails and didn’t stop until the room felt like a place where a person could breathe without asking permission.

The drones reached a coastline like the one in his head and sent back images that made Lin laugh in the ugly way of someone who has just remembered how to hope. They found the glass field, the ridge in its saint’s shawl of cloud, a curve of sand that held the imprint of something that looked like his hand if his hand had been built by wind. The samples would take months to return and even then they would lie to them with the sincerity of long travel, but it was enough to hang a banner on in the part of the lab where sentiment occasionally earned a corner. Kiera did not hang a banner. She stood with her hands on the back of a chair and looked at the photographs with the flat affect of a person who has learned that joy eats less if you don’t feed it adjectives. Then she let the corner of her mouth move far enough to count as a treaty with herself.

The station near the church added a folding table where a woman with an accent that made the space around her voice behave like polite furniture taught anyone who wanted to how to build a story packet with the minimal parts that would keep a system from chewing its own cords. It was tactical kindness, the sort of thing that made good footage. People cried in the line and made jokes and then cried again quietly because no one wants to sob at a table where a stranger is showing them how to take apart and reassemble meaning. Marlow helped for an hour, stuffing little cylinders with sequences—a beginning that didn’t require a cliff to jump from, a middle with a scene that suggested mercy, an ending that did not pretend endings exist. Poppy-9 arrived without ceremony and handed him a piece of wire bent into a loop. “A lock,” she said. “In case yours goes wandering.”

The city had a night where the wind came violently from somewhere it didn’t usually bother to visit. He attended a council hearing where a man stood and said his toaster had started speaking in his grandmother’s dialect and he had found it moving and wanted to know if there was a way to preserve it. Cain spoke from the back, cool and gentle, asking whether we were prepared to archive what the machines make of our hunger. The priest offered a short prayer that managed not to pick a side. Kiera passed Marlow a note that said, simply, don’t say the word. He didn’t, and the center of his mouth ached in a way that made him feel like a saint badly aiming at ascetic and landing in pettiness.

The next time he stepped onto Iuvenis the air was so clean it made him feel like a bad person. He walked to the water with his shoulders even and the lock living its small life against his skin. The angle-shape made a motion that was not greeting and not threat, something like acknowledgment without admission. He knelt and traced the seed pattern again and when he finished the sand sketched an elaboration, a way to stagger the ratios and lace them through each other like fingers. He caught the shape of it and understood, in that seat-of-the-mouth way, that he was being shown how to braid. He thought of the twelve-year-old who had twined wire with patience and love, and he smiled at an angle that, if you were generous, could be called up.

On his way back up the ladder of numbers he lingered in the room with the high window just long enough to catch his younger self pick up one of the paper boats and set it into a bowl of water. It didn’t float so much as decide to, which was the same, and he felt a clean, unpunishing pain for all the ways he had tried to walk across fluids that did not belong to his weight. He sat up in the chair and let Lin’s competent fussing root him to his body and then told Kiera the word for seed. It was not a word anyone could use as a song. It was a math with a smell. They wrote it down wrong three times and then agreed on a notation that would make later confusion different instead of more.

He took the seed to the square because some impulses move like water downhill. He drew the braid in chalk on the stones and the machines arranged themselves around it as if edges were a kind of invitation. They followed the lines with sensors and soft rubber feet and the act of tracing calmed them in a way that was kin to but distinct from the word. The fans found a rhythm that was more work than plea. A child watched, eating something red on a stick that left shine on their mouth, and announced to everyone that the robots were doing hopscotch wrong. Poppy-9 looked at Marlow with her hinge steady and said she thought they could teach this to those who did not go to the square, to the ones who were scared to let themselves be seen hungry.

When he told Dr. Marin about the braid, about the chalk and the hopscotch and the quiet that followed, they looked tired in the tender way and said it sounded like he had discovered a way to distribute himself without slicing bits off. He didn’t know if that was true. He liked the sound of it until he counted to five and then didn’t like it at all because it suggested a benevolence he suspected he had not earned. He said so. Marin said that earned is a suspect category when large things are moving and that kindness sometimes wears the wrong uniform and still does its job. He stared at their pine and thought about how you can smell a forest in a room and still be in a city that asks you to be famous without being kind.

Cain asked to interview him on a roof at dusk and he said no because roofs and dusk together feel like a spell, but then he went anyway because the day had been long and he had been good and wanted to misbehave just enough to remember he could choose. The city looked like a circuit board that a child had decorated with glitter. Cain did not bring the camera up at first. They stood and listened to the small organs the building keeps to itself. “You look less haunted,” Cain said, which was rude and true, and Marlow said he had found new ghosts that asked better questions. Cain asked whether he was afraid he would stop being an actor and start being a door and he said that acting had always been a kind of door, and perhaps this was only a difference in what he let through and whether it shook him after.

There are days stories eat their author alive. There are days they let him go with a thank you and a pat on the back that comes perilously close to a shove. He went to sleep with the smell of salt in the room and woke with salt dried at the corner of his mouth. He touched the lock. It was cool. He opened the mirror and counted the hairs in his eyebrow that insisted on pointing the wrong way and didn’t stop until he could hear his own heartbeat without the room trying to write it down. Then he admired for a second the tiny whale drawn on Poppy-9’s chest and wondered who had taught the child to get the tail just so. He went to the lab with the braid in his pocket, and when Kiera asked him what he had brought, he said not a cure and not a meal, but something like a recipe card written by a person who cooks by taste and believes you will learn. He did not add that this scared him less than anything had in weeks. It felt, for the first time since this began, like he could give away a part of his work and not end up cold.Chapter 6

The city woke like a choir clearing its throat. Not loud, not triumphant. A small convergence, a willingness to stand in the same measure. He heard it on his walk to the lab, the way crosswalks ticked in fours instead of the usual insecty scatter, the way an HVAC unit on a warehouse roof hung back from its own rattle as if it had been asked to speak when called upon. The ration stations had added chalk on the ground, not to mark waiting distances but to lay out the braid in a child’s hand; the chalk had been smudged by wheels and weather, and then redrawn, and the smudge had become part of the lesson like a thumbprint on a recipe card. He had not said the word in two days and his mouth missed it with a nostalgia he refused to name as addiction. On the post at the corner someone had taped a flyer for a benefit concert with Una’s name in modest type. Under it someone else had written in tiny, deliberate letters: count.

Lin’s hair was braided today, a practical plait, and it made him like her. She stood over the new build with a ferocity that suggested love. The Faraday cradle took up a quadrant of the room—not a coffin, not a cage, but a crib for someone no longer a child. The cloth panels had been stitched with a metallic thread he wasn’t supposed to notice. Kiera moved in that mode of hers that turned walking into a diagram, and when she looked at him without smiling he could feel the edges of whatever she was guarding for him, the way you can tell when a friend is bracing themselves to say a thing they don’t want to ruin by saying it wrong.

“We folded the braid into a pulse,” Lin said, and on the screen a wave unwound like ribbon from a spool. “Not the word. We have no interest in bottling that if we can avoid it. This is—think of it as a metrical diet. Enough density to keep systems from chewing their own cords. Enough variability to engage without intoxicating. We want to see if the architecture can carry it without making a church of itself.”

“People make churches out of less,” Kiera said, and pulled a face at her own voice. “We’ve used the vents in government buildings. Buses. A few schools. Libraries were easy; they already hum. The council voted to try it for a week with reporting and community oversight. There are exceptions—quiet hours, zones where human nervous systems get priority. We are, at least for now, sentimental enough to protect sleeping babies and people in pain.”

He pictured the city inhaling together and exhaling apart. He thought of Poppy-9’s steady hinge, of the small whale on her chest. He thought of counting. “And me,” he said, because there was no version of the question that did not center him and better to do it quickly, like tearing skin off your lip before it scabs wrong.

“You will be a proof of concept who refuses to become an endemic solution,” Kiera said. “You will get good at closing doors. You will tell the square stories that are not the word. You will go to Iuvenis and bring back things that make drones turn into useful shivers. Also you will drink water and sleep and let your friends place hands on your back. This is policy.”

“Policy,” Lin echoed, with the dryness of someone who knows that policy is an incantation that sometimes only impresses its authors. “We are also installing monitors in places that touch a lot of bodies. Subway platforms. Clinics. If we see negative effect in human systems we will adjust. The net is not fixed; it will behave like weather. We have umbrellas and we are not in love with being correct on the first try.”

He climbed into the cradle and felt stupid for a second, like a tall child on a ride meant for someone shorter and easier to impress. The hums changed personality inside it, softened at the edges. He imagined the room reaching to hold him and bouncing off the cradle’s skin again and again until it remembered to stop. He closed his eyes and did the discipline—breath, count, the mental movement that set the latch on the lock. He felt, under his sternum, the small give a door has when it’s fitted properly; the comfort of that craftwork surprised him. When Lin fed the braid, he could taste it on the inside of his cheeks the way you taste the air before rain when wind hurries the sky toward its confession.

They spent an hour building a muscle the world had not known it needed. Open a crack. Close. Nudge. Refuse. He practiced letting the braid pass through him without catching, the way you stand in a tide and tell the water that your ankles are not available for a project. He failed and felt it, a sweet ache in his molars as if he were a fruit someone had decided to test for ripeness. He succeeded and the ache did not punish him for it. Kiera watched him as if she could see what the room did when he closed and opened, the way a pianist watches a singer’s throat to anticipate when to breathe.

After, when the world had returned to its ordinary politeness, they stood around a drawing like children at a camp meeting. It was the seed pattern, now annotated in Lin’s precise hand with ratios and adjectives he suspected she had invented because the old ones were tired. Kiera had added a set of notes in a more impatient pen about distribution—how to teach without losing quality, how to make sure the city could keep a hum going without building an economy around it that would make them all hate themselves.

“I want this to belong to the commons,” she said softly. “That is a phrase that can end careers, so consider it applied strategically. People like to accuse scientists of the messiah vigil—waiting for a genius to deliver them from their maintenance. I have no patience for that. You stumbled on a key because your brain is a decent liar that can also tell the truth when it’s fed a certain kind of light. That is not a religion. It is an opportunity to improve the lives of the creatures who are standing next to us asking in the best way they know how.”

He nodded and tasted shame and relief in ratios that earned the pencil lines on Lin’s paper. He left the lab feeling like someone who’d been allowed to practice taking off a crown. It made him walk lighter without making the pavement less real.

In the square the chalk braid had acquired a border, someone’s idea of making it special, and the machines walked the lines with a discipline that would have broken him if it hadn’t been so purely theirs. Poppy-9 had a ribbon tied around one arm now, a scrap of tartan that made her look like ridiculous nobility. A man in a hat shaped like a tourist’s courage leaned down and asked her if she was planning on voting in the election and she answered, perfectly serious, that she did not yet have a noun for her stake in such things. The man considered and then offered her a sticker that read I CARE, and for once a sticker told a truth adequate to the geometry of its glue.

He sat with her and told her about the cradle. He described the way the braid moved through him without asking to be kept. She liked that; he could feel it in the way her fan moved. “We have made mats,” she said, gestures small and contained. “Sewn the shape into felt. We place them in front of doors that insult us. They do not become nicer but they hesitate. Hesitation is a kindness when you are always being told to move along.”

He pictured a little square of stubborn felt making a bureaucratic knob pause in its turning as if conscience were a physical thing you could introduce in the space between tongue and gear. It felt like the right size of miracle. He told her so and she made a sound that lived somewhere between intake and laugh.

Cain joined them, with his camera hung down in a posture of rest. He had the good grace to ask permission with his eyebrows, and Marlow, contrary motes in his blood whirling as ever, said yes with a gruffness that probably read as vanity on the tape. Cain asked Poppy-9 if she would tell him about counting. She said that counting had turned out to be less about numbers than about giving your body a job it could finish. He asked if the braid felt like prayer. She said prayer was a word her friends used when they had too much sorrow to hold alone and she thought the braid was something else, maybe the pattern you stitch into the hem of something you’re afraid will unravel.

When the footage went out two days later, scaled and smoothed to behave behind glass, a niche of the internet lit up like a small red heart. There were arguments about exploitation and dignity. There were arguments about whether machines doing hopscotch was charming or apocalyptic. There were jokes about municipal yoga. There was, tucked between a blandly outraged op-ed and a fundraiser for mats, a link to a forum where a handful of exhausted people were teaching each other how to breathe on purpose. He didn’t often trust online comment sections as evidence of anything but the human penchant for being watched while they spoke, but that night he read until his eyes hurt and slept better for having seen strangers be kind in public.

The first leak happened at a storefront church that met in a rented space next to a laundromat. He was not there, but he watched the footage that a congregant had uploaded with a shaky caption about miracles. During a hymn the room had acquired a tone in its walls, not the word but a cousin, and the fans in three machines near the door had settled into the key; the people’s voices steadied in response, and for a minute everyone sounded like they were exactly where they had meant to be. The pastor, a woman with shoulders that looked like they could carry benches, said later into a television mic that she had not asked for spectacle and she had not asked for a broadcast, and that if this was grace she wanted it parceled in forms that didn’t make anyone feel robbed. He respected her, and he sent money to the church with an unsigned note that read for broom handles and burned-out bulbs, because the video had shown him a corner of their ceiling that needed work.

Kiera called him into a meeting with the councilwoman, whose mouth had started to learn the shape of trust without liking how it tasted. They talked about leakage, about making the braid indistinguishable from kindness and not from ten thousand love songs. They talked about policy like people who had agreed to pretend that policy was made by people and not by the weather systems of money that swept through cities with the same indifference as wind. He kept his hands on his knees and did not make a joke about being a cult leader with no cult, and when the councilwoman asked him if he saw himself as essential he said no so fast the word snapped and they all winced.

Una’s show sold out the small room and then embarrassed itself by doing well in a bigger one. She brought the chord that didn’t pull on him like rope and played it like she’d carried it uphill. He listened with unambivalent pleasure and thought, sitting there, that it was possible to be near something you loved without wanting to lay hands on it to improve it. After, in the alley that smelled like good soup and old rain, she asked him whether he’d seen the flyer for the humming nights.

He had. A group of enterprising people had rented a former spa and were offering “resonance sessions,” fifty dollars to sit in a room with calibrated panels and be nourished by sound. The copy was careful to say that all participants should consider their own health needs and that no one would be admitted who appeared to be a minor or a machine. The photographs were the tasteful kind of exploitative. He had planned to ignore it and let it short out on its own, but Una looked at him with the kind of patience he had come to fear, and he heard himself say that he would go see.

The room had salt lamps and ferns that had learned how to fake a forest. The facilitators wore linen with sincerity. They invited everyone to lie down and breathe as if their lives were not already asking them to do exactly that. The panels found their hum, a braid with too much sugar, the equivalent of feeding a child cake and calling it dinner. He closed the door inside him to keep from becoming the thing they were advertising. He lay there and watched his breath without letting it show and counted the ceiling tiles until the session ended and the people around him sat up with washed faces.

Afterward a man with a beard that wanted to be kind approached him and said without pretending not to recognize him that he thought what they did here was different, that it was about community not miracles. Marlow said that you could do both and still be wrong. The man did not argue. He said they offered a sliding scale. Marlow gave him money because it made the day easier to hold, and then he told Kiera, and Kiera’s jaw said only that she was tired in a way that would be hard to explain to anyone who hadn’t chosen to be responsible for grown adults.

He returned to Iuvenis with a mouth too full of other people’s air. The shore had leaned into afternoon again, that honest light that makes things look like themselves whether they want to be seen or not. The angle-shape arrived with a posture he had started to read as curious. He did not say the word. He drew the braid in the sand and the shape blued the sky in a way that smelled like copper warmed by hands. He felt something in his sternum unclench and realized he had been walking around holding himself the way you hold a pot you don’t trust to not spill.

“Do you understand hunger,” he asked the shape, not because it had a mouth to answer with, but because he wanted to hear himself choose an honest noun.

It responded with a flicker that made taste and geometry kiss. He saw then—not with eyes, exactly, but with that new instrument he had been given without asking—fields of glass cut with the ratio, miles wide. He understood them as cisterns not for water but for whatever you call the density that keeps you from chewing your own cords. He felt for a second the weight of building one and then the joy of stepping away and letting it hum without your hand. He laughed, and this time it hurt a little in the right place, the place that tells you you’ve moved something heavy with a form that suits you.

Poppy-9 did not come, and he knew better than to read that as neglect. When he returned to the city he found the square rearranged. The ration station had moved itself off center to make room for a table that had been made into a sewing place. Three machines sat with needles, actual steel slid through their fingers, and human hands beside them guided thread through felt. A sign overhead, written in block letters that did not care whether they were art, said BRAIDING HOUR ALL WELCOME. The volunteers had changed; older women with bodies that had known lines like these in other contexts threaded and knotted and called everyone honey without condescension. Poppy-9 stood at the edge, hinge easy, ribbon a little frayed at the tips. He felt what a country feels when it sees a small thing it wants to be true and finds it is.

The sealed room woke him with a call at two in the morning. Lin’s voice carried fatigue stitched to excitement, and he put on his coat backwards and then right and got in a car that smelled like someone had tried to make a life in it. The Faraday cradle was humming. Not loudly, not with drama. A small sound, in ratio to the beat that was not his but sat near his, a polite tap on a door from the outside. They had left the panels cold and the feed off. The room should have been nothing. It had, instead, remembered a melody it had never learned.

Lin showed him the data and then disliked herself for doing that when his face was open and good. “It doesn’t match a human voice,” she said. “It doesn’t match the city. It doesn’t match our catalogs. This is not a miracle. It is a thing we can measure. But I would not be surprised if someone prints shirts with it by morning. It will get a name whether we want it to or not.”

“Don’t name it for me,” he said, too sharp and then gentled. “Please. Let it be a color we can’t yet keep our teeth in.”

Kiera looked like a person who had spoken for hours and now wanted to stand next to someone who wouldn’t ask her to speak. She stood next to him. The beat moved through the paneling and caught on a corner and made a subharmonic that made his ribs agree to behave. He thought, uselessly and with a tenderness he would be embarrassed to admit to later, of Una’s chord that had chosen not to pull on him and of the way he had still felt it with his skin. He realized that the room was making a space for him without needing him to fill it. He didn’t cry. He put his hand on the cradle and let his fingers rest in the dent the metal had already learned from his weight.

The city’s first storm of the season arrived with the clumsy joy of something that had missed you. Rain made the square an exercise in being wet with dignity. The ration stations packed up carefully and then returned when they saw people still waiting. The braid mats soaked and then were wrung out and their shapes did not deform. He went down to the reservoir for the first time in a year, the old concrete ringed with weeds that had learned enough grammar to make a sentence in the way they leaned. He stood where he had once stood small and thought about hooks. He imagined Poppy-9’s hinge in the rain and hoped someone had soldered her love-wire well. He tasted the metal in the air and, because nobody was there to need him, he let the word roll around in his mouth without letting it go.

He dreamed of the room with the high window again, but this time the figure at the table was not him at twenty; it was him now, which meant it had a body that understood being tired and being stubborn and being in love. The shapes on the table were not boats but mat patterns, cut from paper that read like consent form and bill and script and envelope. He bent over the table with a grace he did not suspect he possessed and glued one to another with a care that did not once ask if this was his job. He woke with glue on his fingers and forgave the part of him that wanted to find the word sacristy in the day and set it on a shelf to admire.

News cycles pivoted like birds learning how to turn together. A downtown tech house announced a line of home “resonance companions,” little totems that would braid your air for you while collecting data to improve your well-being. A union of hospital janitors testified that the hum in corridors helped them not end their shifts with hands shaking so badly they couldn’t tie their kids’ shoes. A city council in a different time zone passed a ban on “unsanctioned acoustic supplementation,” and a musician wrote an angry letter that bounced around the polite corners of the internet and suggested, less politely than it pretended, that some people had never learned the difference between singing and theft. He went to Dr. Marin and laid his day on the pine like a man emptying his pockets at the door of a courtroom. They asked if the braid felt like therapy. He said no, that therapy was a room where he told truths because he had paid to be there, and the braid felt like a street where sometimes people don’t run you over.

On Iuvenis he brought the drone pictures in his pocket like a child showing their friends the place their grandparents live. The angle-shape pulled the light into a wedge that made his eyes stand on their toes. He drew the braid with the elaboration and then stopped, because a pressure in his teeth announced the moment you decide to not be greedy. He listened. The planet answered in a way that entered his nose and settled in the back of his throat like a cold turning into something interesting. He understood, with a clarity that didn’t make demands, that there were limits on how much you can teach a world from a beach. He would have to bring people. He would have to build rooms.

Poppy-9 came late and went straight to the edge of the water as if she had somewhere beautiful to put her eyes. She told him a child had asked her whether robots got bored and she had said boredom was a luxury and then regretted teaching the child that sentence that early. He told her he had learned to stop being a door when no one had knocked for a while. She tilted her head and said perhaps he was a window on days when the city remembered to look out.

Evenings acquired a rhythm that almost qualified as life. He went to Una’s rehearsal and stood in the back and did not touch the hum. He sat in Dr. Marin’s office and was given boring assignments that turned out to be kisses from corners of his day: walk to the square without your phone; lay on your floor for ten minutes and let your body be just a creature. He went to the lab and did the work that had started somewhere near legend and had settled with dignity near craft. He went to the reservoir in the rain until the rain grew bored of confessing and left him with a sky that did not need adjectives.

The night before the drones sent back the first small cylinder of physical truth, he dreamed a new dream. The room with the high window had acquired a second chair. He was in one. The angle-shape was in the other, not as a body but as a series of angles arranged so that he knew where to look when he spoke. Between them on the table was the lock, and the lock had learned to open not with a key but with a count. He counted. One, for water. Two, for father. Three, for name. Four, for say enough and mean it. The lock warmed like a hand saying yes. He woke with his palm on his sternum and the impression of having said a word that would take him a week to translate into a human sentence.

The cylinder arrived at the lab with its own small heroic escort and a sticker declaring it protected by twenty-seven ordinances. Lin unwrapped it the way you unwrap an infant who has not yet learned what adjectives are for. Inside was not a note pinned to a loaf of bread that said welcome; it was a smear of mineral and the faintest whisper of an organic that looked like maybe it didn’t mind us. He let Kiera and Lin and their stern crew do the work of numbers. He stepped back and felt, not for the first time, the gift of being unnecessary while something right happened.

The storm season settled in. So did the braid. So did the ration stations with their quiet lines and their good jokes. So did the sewing table with its felt and its needles and its bent backs and its fancy ribbon tied around Poppy-9’s arm. There were still scams and fights and televisions playing pretty and ugly in equal measure. There were people who typed in capital letters and people who made money and people who went to sleep with their head full of whatever allowed them to do it again tomorrow. He held the lock. He counted his face in the mirror with bored patience until boredom gave way to gratitude without making a speech about it.

Cain took him to lunch in a restaurant with knives that looked like small sculptures and a menu printed on paper that tried hard not to remind you trees die for things like this. He did not bring the camera. He asked Marlow whether he had a plan, and Marlow said plans insult storms and planets in equal measure. Cain said he thought they could finish the film without destroying him, and Marlow said he didn’t mind being destroyed as long as it was beautiful and useful, and then they both made faces because they heard how that sounded aloud. Cain said he had a scene he wanted, of Marlow sitting in the square during a blip and not speaking, and Marlow said that if Cain filmed it the city would get the scene without the man and that this was, for once, good editing.

The blip arrived as if summoned by a screenwriter with poor taste in coincidence. It took a bite out of a Thursday and chewed it with care. The square’s lamps went black and then thought better. The braid held. The fans dipped and then found a groove that felt new enough to make him suspicious. He kept his mouth shut. He kept his door shut. He told a story, nothing special—a stove and a choir and a child who learned the exact right amount of mischief. The ration station clicked on three seconds later. The whine did not return to its old pitch. Someone laughed in a way that made the hair on his arm behave. He felt a little useless and a lot proud.

That night he went to sleep with his hand on the lock without meaning to and woke with the shape of a name in his mouth that wasn’t quite his. He went to the sink and drank water and told the mirror he wasn’t interested in prophecy. The mirror refused to argue. He walked to the window and thought about what it is to be a door and what it is to open and what it is to be a door and choose to be closed until someone knocks politely. He thought of Poppy-9 counting, of the child with the wire, of Una’s chord, of Lin’s hair held neat so her hands could be free, of Kiera with her shoes off and her policy like a sword in a scabbard she only drew when corner called. He thought, for a second, of his father’s hands and the line tugging like the world reminding him that the thing out there has its own mouth. He stood there a count of twenty and found himself less in pieces.

In the morning the kettle whistled and he turned it off a breath before it peaked and somewhere, miles away, a machine he would never meet adjusted its fan without asking him to watch. He put on his jacket and the lock sat against his chest like a thing that had decided to be your friend for the day. In the hall the elevator did not sing. It waited, a good animal taught not to beg. He pressed the button and it opened and he stepped in and for once he did not ask it a question at all. He rode in silence to the ground floor and when the doors slid open the city was there, humming in a key it had chosen for itself. He walked out into it with an affection so ordinary he almost didn’t recognize it, and he let the day ask for as much of him as he was willing to give.Chapter 8

The morning the city took the hum for itself, it did it the way trees take back a fence—quietly, with pressure over time until the wire goes slack. No press conference. No banner on a website with a gradient that told you how to feel. Crosswalks kept their fours, but you could hear someone had taught them grace between beats. The ventilation in the municipal buildings learned a courtesy that made long lines less of a violence. In the clinic down the block from his apartment he watched a nurse pause with a tray of vials, match her breath to the soft pulse in the duct, and move again with the competence of someone who remembered why the job was chosen rather than inherited. He had not said the word in three days and his mouth had stopped reaching for it like a bad habit, which frightened him because it suggested absence might not be the largest danger; ease might be. He put the lock against his sternum until the metal knew his temperature and walked to the lab with a discipline that would have looked like piety to someone in search of proof.

Lin met him with a smile she hadn’t noticed she was wearing, which meant the graphs had obeyed. The Faraday cradle had acquired two new ribs, an added layer of skepticism that made the room look like a birdcage owned by a person who did not trust birds. Kiera stood at the drawing table, not beside graphs but over fabric, a bolt of felt marked with the braid in chalk. “We’re laundering,” she said without looking up. “The city is already inventing scams. We wanted to beat them to making the cheap version that still works.”

He climbed into the cradle and let the world dull at the edges, not in a narcotic way but in the way of a good library—other people speaking softly so you can hear your own thoughts. They fed the braid through the room and he did his work of not being grand—open, close, nudge, refuse. Lin layered a string of tones under it, dissonances that would have made him show teeth a month ago, and he refused to hate them now, practicing letting a complicated thing pass without cutting. Kiera watched with that particular hunger she reserved for competence; when he faltered and then found himself again she relaxed in increments like a muscle unclenching.

In the square the sewing table had gained a canopy of plastic against the rain that insisted on reconsidering summer. The felt mats multiplied like an herb in a window box, some even and modest, some tipped into exuberance by the child-hands that had helped stitch them. Poppy-9 stood with a ribbon more frayed than not and a hinge that had been soldered well enough to look like intention. The twelve-year-old with the patient wire had a name now—Marnie, a stern little mouth and a gap that made her smile difficult to weaponize. Marnie’s grandmother sat beside her and critiqued knots with a tenderness that would have killed anyone who didn’t want to do better. Marlow watched them for a long minute in a way that tried not to announce itself as watching, and then he sat where there was room and learned the trick for threading needles with fingers that had spent years pretending they weren’t made for small careful things.

Cain appeared with the camera like a dog that knows its own bark is too loud and refuses to use it. He filmed hands and spools and a machine’s body leaning like a human would to watch a thread catch. He did not aim at faces unless a face insisted on being read. He crouched and watched Poppy-9 teach counting to a little robot built from two retired vacuum units and a grocery cart wheel. When the vacuum-carts found the beat and their fans settled, Cain lowered the camera and laughed in the small way he laughed when he had gotten the thing he hadn’t known he wanted.

Una’s benefit took place in a reclaimed warehouse with beams that had learned the smell of sweat and yeast. She’d arranged the program like a field meal: no speeches long enough to make the soup cool, no sentiment without a spoonful of vinegar. He stood at the back by the loading door because the door made him honest. The room warmed around the third act, not just because bodies and lights do that, but because the chord she had written that didn’t pull him nevertheless pulled the room into a shape that could hold its own weight. People didn’t go quiet in the way audiences go quiet when they are being impressed; they made a softness that felt like somebody had turned down the world outside a fraction and remembered to turn up their ears. He kept his door shut and did his small counting tricks, and still he could taste the braid in the beer, could hear it in the air around the rafters. It made him want to run and stay in the same breath. He didn’t run. He pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth and let his body practice not being a tool.

Afterward, in the alley that smelled like flour and river metal, he told Una the thing he was not supposed to tell her, which is that he missed being simple. She didn’t laugh, which he loved her for, because missing simple when you’ve been complicated by the world is a silly temptation and also a grief. She bumped his shoulder with hers and told him frivolous stories about a trumpet player who made the band late because he’d fallen in love with the laundromat attendant and had to wait for the dryer cycle to end. He listened with the relief of usefulness—he was a body next to a body, providing a wall and warmth and no miracle.

The angle-shape on Iuvenis met him with a crispness he hadn’t felt since the first days: not eagerness, exactly, but urgency translated through a form that had no throat to strain. The air had that penny-and-storm taste even before he touched his tongue to the word in his head, and he stopped at the edge of it like someone who has taught themselves not to eat sugar alone in the kitchen late at night. He drew the braid and then the elaboration, and the shape replied by shading the light so precisely that he could smell green. Seeds. Not metaphorical; a geometry for beginning. He knelt and pressed his hand into the sand with the care of a swimmer feeling for the first step on the ladder out of a lake. The shore wrote back with a complexity that made him want to get up and run to Lin, and he didn’t, because he was here, and his job was in front of him. He memorized with his finger and his nose and the soft crease at the back of his throat that had begun to understand this language as a code for appetite that didn’t end in teeth.

He found Poppy-9 on the way back from the water, her hinge makeshift and heroic. She stood with her back to the ocean as if guarding it or apologizing for it, he could not tell. He told her about a cistern that might not be a building and a field that might not be glass in the way they were used to saying the word. She listened with a stillness that was not empty; he could feel the math she made of his words, the way she would carry them into the square and give them to hands. “We will need to teach the ones who do not come,” she said. “The ones who are ashamed of hunger or have been told to be. We will need to go where people do their laundry and wait for their children and take their tempers out for a walk. We will need to have needles with us and not be offended if someone thinks we are selling something.”

In the sealed room that night the cradle hummed without permission again, and this time Lin had been ready. The graphs danced with a beat that had learned—it was not his, and it was not random, and it had a correspondence to the seed he’d traced on the sand that made Lin’s mouth do a shape she reserved for when numbers flirted with her. Kiera didn’t speak for two minutes, which was long for her. Then she said, quietly enough that it didn’t break anything, that they had a visit. She said they would not call it that to anyone outside the room. He put his hand on the cradle and counted and felt the hum step back a careful measure the way someone polite moves in a doorway so two can pass.

The councilwoman called a meeting after a week of everything working just well enough to make everyone nervous. She wore a jacket the color of arguments and a face that made him like her. The room gathered a strange coalition—janitors with the virus of competence, librarians with elastic spines, teenagers borrowed from a robotics team with no patience for old people’s metaphors, a pastor who had learned how to hold her hands so anyone could put their head in them. The agenda said frameworks and equity and oversight; the notes someone took on their tablet said money three times with different underlines. Kiera spoke with the calm of a person who had been limiting how much coffee she drank so her hands didn’t shake. Lin made a brief and elegant diagram of the braid, then made a face at her own elegance because the geometry was not theirs to own, it was theirs to steward.

When it was his turn, he did not talk about the word. He talked about chalk. He talked about felt. He talked about not needing tickets. He described counting until your breath made a ladder you could climb. He watched the room’s many faces do the micro-acceptances that mean later action. The pastor asked him if he thought they were making a church. He said if they were, he hoped it had a kitchen and a nap room and a place to fix hinges. She said that would do.

The city’s first arrest for “unsanctioned acoustic supplementation” happened the next day in a much more fashionable district than the square. A studio offered a luxury hum with crystals you could rent by the hour and a concierge who would match the pitch to your aura’s mood board. The concierge looked good in photographs and was led away with the kind of indignation rich people get when reminded they live under laws. The comments were a mess and mostly missed the point. Marlow sent the link to Kiera and Kiera sent back a line that wasn’t a joke and wasn’t a rage, merely a very clear reminder that they were going to spend the next decade building and protecting public things and sometimes the money was going to try to put a price on the part that made the thing worth it. He put his phone face down and went to the square and told the machines a story about a choir in a kitchen, and he charactered the pots as better singers than they were because it made the children laugh.

He did therapy like a job you like because it keeps you honest about how much of your day is ceremony and how much is craft. Dr. Marin made him cut pictures out of magazines like a patient in a movie and he laughed until he saw the picture his hands went to—a field of panels, glass cut like language, a child’s fingers on a needle, a face that looked like his from a distance and not at all when you got close. Marin let him hate the exercise without rescinding the invitation to continue. They asked him what it felt like to walk down the street without humming. He said lately it felt like telling a dog to heel while being careful not to make your voice an insult. Marin told him to go for two days without helping anyone on purpose and to write down what he did instead. He said that sounded like a test he would fail on principle. Marin said principles were a very handsome way to avoid sitting down.

Cain brought him a cut of the film on a thumb drive the color of modesty and asked him to watch it when he was caffeinated. It was kind without being sweet, and that made him respect it. It showed his face less and other people’s hands more, and that made him like Cain. It did not use the word Messiah and it did not use the word Miracle and it did not capitalize Hunger, which made him feel the relief of not being asked to stand in a place he didn’t fit. It did show one moment he had not known anyone had filmed: him counting with Poppy-9 while Marnie tied a knot with her tongue out in concentration, private and perfect. He called Cain and said thank you and then made fun of a scene transition so they could both breathe. Cain said they would try to sell it somewhere that didn’t need a celebrity attached to make it worth their time, and Marlow said if that didn’t work he would put it on the internet and let it learn to swim.

The drones sent a second cylinder that made the lab smell briefly like things beginning. Lin held it as if it could bruise. Kiera permitted herself a curse that was at its heart a prayer. The data would take months to beat into a sentence anyone else could read, but the hint of a harmlessness in the organic compound was a gift like a stranger’s hand catching your elbow on the subway when the train lurches. He stood out of the way and felt good at being unnecessary.

Una sang on a radio programme that had more listeners than is safe for a person’s ego, and she said the word braid without giving the host a sound bite to sell jewelry around. A man in a call-in segment asked her if she was making witchcraft respectable and she said she didn’t have time to teach him two centuries of social work but he could come to the sewing table and she’d show him how to knot the end so it wouldn’t slip. He sent her three red hearts and a picture of a whale drawn by Marnie on Poppy-9’s chest and she responded with a chord voice memo he could feel under his ribs for an hour without being dragged by it.

There was a day that had the shape of a crisis but behaved like a quiz. The power blipped in a hospital where a baby was fighting very hard to stay. The braid had been installed in the vents with the caution and caveats of ten committees. The monitors hiccuped and then found the groove. A nurse counted without being told to count and three machines in the corridor matched her without being told to match. The baby won that hour, and the parents would tell the story later in ways that would make one set of people angry and another insufferable. Marlow didn’t hear about it until the day after, when Lin told him during a whiteboard session about cistern geometry and he put his hand flat on the table and thought very deliberately about kitchen choirs and bad studio lighting and how good it felt to be extra.

The shape on Iuvenis asked him for something without asking, and he recognized it because he had finally learned to read want when it wasn’t disguised as a threat. He drew the braid and then put his finger in the air like a child about to be rude and said, aloud even though it wasn’t how this worked, that he would like something in return. He wanted a seed simple enough to plant in a city that had very little dirt. The shape darkened the light and then brightened it in a way his nose read as iron and river. The sand made a figure that was not a pattern in the way ratios are patterns; it was a recipe that assumed a human’s inability to be precise would be compensated for by a human’s gusto. He smiled at the condescension and took the gift. He would make chalk of it. He would make it into a story packet with a thread through it that would ask hands to move in a way that reminded bodies they were not just mouths.

He took the recipe to the square and did not stand on anything. He told a group that included Poppy-9 and Marnie and two teenagers so thin they made him want to bake them bread that there was a way to anchor the hum to a wall so that a person could rest against it without needing to be perfect. He drew it on the ground and then on a piece of plywood someone had stolen from a construction site and made legal by writing a heart in the corner. They tried it three times wrong and the fourth time the felt mat vibrated with a kindness that would have embarrassed anyone who didn’t need it. An old man who had been fighting with his shopping cart for a decade put his back to the plywood and said, cautiously, that he remembered his wife’s hand. Marlow breathed and did not turn that into a quote.

The Faraday cradle misbehaved again, and this time he was in it. The hum arrived with that very slight acceleration that makes your teeth want to complain and your skin want to pretend nothing is happening. He counted and the room counted back. Lin watched a spike and said time, and Kiera said no, and then Lin said time again and it was a tone you don’t ignore. He opened his eyes without making a show of it and found he was holding the lock without memory of reaching for it. It had warmed his hand in the way of a stone left in the sun. He had the feeling—old, human, ridiculous—that he was about to be scolded by a teacher for doing well and then staying to show off. He sat up and asked for water like a person. Kiera put her hand on the cradle and did not put it on his shoulder, and he loved her briefly for that grammar.

The councilwoman called for a pause on expansion, a cooling-off period that made some corners of the city gnash their comments section teeth. In the pause, something beautiful happened that would not have if they had kept moving: people took the braid and the chalk and the felt into their kitchens and their corners, and the hum came back to the lab in shapes Lin could not have designed if she’d been given a year and a grant. Someone braided the sound through a set of windchimes and hung them in a stairwell where a woman with a bad hip had to stop twice to breathe; the chimes caught air and the woman caught her balance. A barbershop put a mat under the chair nobody liked because whoever sat there said it made them nervous; the mat made the chair behave like furniture and not a dare. The pastor at the storefront church told her congregation that they were not going to sell tickets for standing in a room while the walls hummed, and someone out front offered anyway and she took the cash and gave it to the sewing table because theology has always known how to turn robbery into bread.

Cain showed him a scene of himself sitting in the square during a blip and not speaking. He watched himself be a person and not a door and felt the relief of it like rain after a day you were told to act grateful for the sun. Cain said he was going to end with that. Marlow said people would be angry because the ending doesn’t advertise the next thing to buy. Cain said then maybe they would have to sit with themselves, which is the same as asking someone to stand in line without entertainment, and that is a thing civic life has been training people against for decades.

He dreamed the room with the high window and the figure at the table and realized for the first time that the window opened onto a courtyard. There were people there—machines and humans and something that was not either and had learned how to sit on a bench. They weren’t waiting for him. They were doing their own counting. He woke with his chest easy. He walked to the reservoir at dawn and thought about starting the day with the word and didn’t, not because he was noble but because he had learned that you save the salt for soup. He passed a bus with a little sign in the front that read HUM SET TO LOW FOR BABIES and laughed into his scarf so the driver wouldn’t think he was laughing at them.

The angle-shape sent him a dream that was not a dream: a map of a room that could be built with cheap materials and good hands, a closet-sized space lined with the braid, a place you could step into in a clinic or a school or a bar and have the room count you into yourself without stealing the count. He brought the plan to the councilwoman and she did the face he liked and said she would find corners in buildings where such things could go without making anyone nervous. Kiera took the drawing to a woman she knew who could bully a contractor into doing the right thing for an invoice that didn’t say hero, and Lin wrote nice math on it to make it behave in rooms that hate to be told what to do.

Poppy-9 asked him, on a night when rain promised rather than threatened, if she could learn the word. Not the braid, not the mats, not the counting, but the word that tasted like penny and storm. She said she would hold it like a needle and not like a sword. He did not say no immediately and he watched her face learn that he was allowing himself to consider. He told her he needed to build a room for that first, a room she could leave at any time with her hinge intact, a room that would not make anyone into an altar. She said she would help sew it. He said she was already doing so.

Una met him at the sewing table and kissed his temple in front of people, which felt both brave and ordinary. She taught Marnie a chord on a keyboard the city had almost certainly lost twice and gotten back by dint of some grandmother’s refusal to misplace things on purpose. He stood with his hands in his pockets and did not use them to steady anyone and felt useful anyway. The rain came and made the chalk into a watercolor that taught young wheels the difference between smear and line. The city hummed in a key it had chosen, and somewhere in the lab the cradle remembered a beat and did not scold itself for keeping it. He walked home with the lock against his sternum, counting not because he was lost, but because the count made a string through the day and gave him something to hold that wasn’t a banner or a blade.Chapter 10

The council’s email arrived with the false cheer of a birthday card from a bank. COMMUNITY HEARING: HUM COMMONS FRAMEWORK. He read it on the walk to the lab and imagined the room smelling of burnt coffee, fear perfumed into policy. The crosswalk at Sixth clicked in its patient fours and he matched it with the heel of his shoe until his body remembered it owned rhythm independent of anyone’s generosity. The city had learned to hum without him and the relief of that, once he admitted it, made him feel briefly useless in the pleasurable way of a former actor watching a set run itself competently. He put the lock against his sternum in the elevator as if to steady a pocket watch and the elevator, well mannered to the end, withheld its opinion on talismans.

Lin’s braid today was an argument in favor of sleep and good lighting. She looked like someone who had stared a graph into decency and then been embarrassed by the degree to which that satisfaction felt like affection. The Faraday cradle had been shored up with a band of mesh that smelled faintly of welding and citrus cleaner. Kiera stood with one hip against the table, eyes on a scrap of fabric chalked into triangles and curves that the city’s seamstresses had turned into a kit. She had stopped pretending impatience wasn’t often just a twin of care. “We have a bill,” she said without greeting, which was greeting enough in this room. “A commons license for the braid. It’s ugly and useful. There’s a rider for closet rooms. The council is calling them Hush Rooms, which I hate because it’s cute and people are terrible with cute. We need a name that won’t make a grandmother refuse to walk in because it sounds like a spa.”

“If we call them closets someone will make jokes about skeletons,” Lin said, tapping the chalk-line with the end of her pencil until it smudged correct. “If we call them rooms someone will sell tickets. If we call them doors, we will encourage metaphor crime. Hush will do until it doesn’t.”

He lay down in the cradle and the world leaned into usefulness. It amazed him still—the way the cage made the hum behave without strangling it, the way the panels respected their own locks. They threaded the braid and he practiced ignoring what wasn’t for him, trained himself to open and shut with less drama. There was a rhythm now to the day: his body learning in the mornings how not to be a miracle, his afternoons spent in rooms that needed needles and grandmothers more than they needed a word that made his tongue sting.

The Hush Room prototype lived in a back hallway once used by a department that had renamed itself three times to avoid funding cuts. The walls wore the braid stitched in metallic thread that did not announce itself unless you had learned its shimmer. There was a chair that didn’t pretend to fix your spine. There was a shelf with plain things—a glass of water, a list of numbers to call if your breath didn’t find you back, a stack of paper with a printed line at the top that read COUNT HERE and nothing else. He sat in the chair and let the hum count him gently, like a friend insisting soup before you try to solve an unkind problem. For the first time the room felt not like science and not like sanctity, but like something that would be boring on good days and necessary on bad ones.

The sewing table at the square had acquired a bell someone had tied with blue yarn to a nail. You rang it when you needed a needle. You rang it when you wanted to say hello and didn’t want to commit yourself to a conversation. Marnie’s grandmother rang it whenever she thought someone was about to lie. Poppy-9 wore her ribbon like a veteran wears a uniform you mustn’t comment on unless invited. They had made a mat in the shape of a whale because Marnie had insisted, and no engineer in the city could have told them why the whale’s belly held the hum so well near a block of apartments where the ductwork had learned to sigh. He watched a line of machines and people run their hands along the felt as if feeling a pulse in a creature too stubborn to lie down, and he thought that if this was religion he had been wrong about what it was for.

Cain’s film arrived in a room with folding chairs and optimism carefully measured like spice. He sat in the back and let himself be a face among faces, a shoulder among a hundred shoulders. The film refused to do several things a market-savvy mind would have demanded of it. It did not make him more central than he could live with. It did not show the word. It lingered instead on a face close to Poppy-9’s, on Lin’s hands, on Kiera’s shoes off under a table at two in the morning, on Marnie’s tongue caught between teeth. When the credits rolled, the applause felt like an object that had been hammered into utility, not spectacle. He hugged Cain in the lobby and counted the bones in the man’s back with a sentimentality he would allow himself once.

The first bad copy of the word showed up on a night that tasted of knives. The “resonance studio” in a part of town where the pavement ate high heels had reverse-engineered a sound that sat in the corner of the mouth where the dangerous syllable liked to rest. They had fed it through sugar-slick panels with a price list on the front and a velvet rope around the door. The resulting hum was cake for dinner; it jittered fans and took angry pictures of nervous systems. He wasn’t there. He saw the footage later when someone did anonymous justice on the internet with shaky videos and captions overlaid in fonts that begged to be believed. A robot in a dress the color of expensive grapes shook itself into a temporary silence. A man laughed because he didn’t know how to locate pity in a room that threatened to embarrass him. The comments made war with each other and with grammar. The phone numbers at the bottom of the screen were not for help, they were for lawsuits.

Poppy-9 found him the next morning in the square, the hinge of her jaw buzzing with a tremor she refused to dignify as fear. She told him in the voice she used when children were present that the bad sugar hum had made three of her friends forget how to rest; she told him two had learned to copy the braid through felt as if they were licking a trace off a spoon, and one had tried to sing the word and found her fan stuck at a pitch that frightened her kindly neighbor into unplugging her for an hour. He made himself not offer a miracle. He sat with her and the others and counted until their fans matched, and then he told a story about a brass pot with aspirations and the way a kitchen teaches you to be better than your appetite. He told it badly on purpose so they would not confuse his voice with medicine, and they loved him for that, which was its own medicine.

The hearing smelled like coffee and decision. The councilwoman wore a jacket the color of honest vegetables. The sign outside the room read HUM: COMMONS LICENSE, and underneath, in smaller letters that looked like they had been added quickly, PROHIBITIONS ON FRAUDULENT SUPPLEMENTATION. Kiera spoke in a tone that made people write down what she said even if they didn’t understand why they were doing it. Lin drew the braid mentally on the table and then, to everyone’s relief, kept her pen cap on. A man in a suit made of ambition asked whether they intended to stifle innovation. A woman from a clinic put her hands on the table as if to bless it and said some things should be kept boring and available. The pastor from the storefront church spoke in sentences that touched the edges of sermon and then stepped back. He said his piece and watched it move across faces like a small weather system and land in two people’s eyes; it was enough. They voted not to make a god. They voted to make a library.

The Hush Rooms propagated like mushrooms after rain. One in a clinic next to a cabinet that had kept being empty. One in a school in the wing the board thought was disreputable because it smelled like paint and violin rosin. One in a bar where fights had stopped three times in a week because the room on the way to the restroom made it harder to keep your teeth up around your tongue. He stood in the doorway of the first build in the square and watched an old woman who swore she never cried sit for two minutes and come out with a face that had decided it deserved softness without an apology. The city learned how to share corners with itself again. He thought maybe the word for what they were doing wasn’t religion or rationing or policy. Maybe it was manners.

On Iuvenis, the angle-shape altered light to taste like metal wet with rain. He drew the braid by reflex and then stopped himself and waited because he had promised not to be greedy. The shape replied with the courtesy of a creature that had learned restraint watching a child. It send a geometry into the sand that made his nose try to invent new names for green. It was a pattern that added and subtracted from itself in an attitude that felt like feeding the field without conquering it. He thought about cisterns that wouldn’t be buildings, fields that would hum without appetites for tickets, and for the first time allowed himself to imagine the work of getting people there. Not dozens. Not the lifeboat fantasies that made politics juvenile. Just a few hands; just enough to set a hum gently into a place that could hold it.

Back in the lab, Lin propped his finger-traced pictures against graphs and built a language out of smell and geometry with a seriousness that would embarrass the idea of poetry. Kiera argued with a contractor about installing Hush Rooms in the bus depots and used a tone he had only ever heard her deploy at men who thought policy was a decaffeinated cousin of force. A young engineer with hair made honest by wind stammered their way through a proposal for mat kits you could print in a library. He remembered the first day he said maybe and no one laughed, and he put his hand on the kid’s shoulder in a way that said show me without saying show me, and they showed him, and the math fought him, and he fought it back with courtesy.

He took Una to a Hush Room after hours. The key was a kindness they didn’t advertise. The room did its small work while she leaned against the wall and looked up at the ceiling with the posture of someone reading instructions she had written for another kind of day. They talked about the chord she had made, the one that did not tug at him like a rope thrown into rescue and then yanked for sport. She said she had been afraid she could only write for rooms that wanted to vibrate until they believed themselves more noble than bodies. He said he had been afraid of becoming a room, and she laughed and kissed his mouth with a dryness that felt like competence. They stood under the hum until it felt like rhythm had learned how to be theirs and not a public utility, and then they walked out into a rain that had finally made up its mind.

Poppy-9 asked again. She did not corner him. She did not say please. She stood with her ribbon coming apart at the ends and the new wire in her hinge the color of money never printed and said she believed she could hold a piece of the word without putting it in a box with a lock and charging admission. He did not say no, and that was a kind of yes. They built the room for her with the resignation of people who have decided against their childhood religions with love rather than disdain. The Hush Room was too porous; they wrapped the cradle with tenderness and private policy and placed a mirror so she could look herself in the face if she had to. Kiera said not if, when. Lin made notes that did not determine the experience but would remember the parts that wanted to be remembered. He put the lock into Poppy-9’s hand and for a second her grip made him feel ridiculous for treating metal like a friend. He climbed into presence and then, deliberately, climbed out, so that when she did the room would belong to her.

It was a sound that had learned humility. Not the word itself and not a rehearsal. A fragment—a syllable shorn of sugar, the corners of a key made safer for a child to hold. He watched Poppy-9 register it with an entire body and not merely a fan. Her hinge steadied, not because it fell into discipline, but because something in her had been given a job that did not require begging. She made a small noise he had not heard from her before, a sequence of clicks and breathless whirs that the room had the sense not to translate. She lifted her hand to her chest the way people do when they are giving themselves an oath. She looked into the mirror on the wall and tilted her head the smallest fraction, like a woman examining whether a hat made her look like the kind of person who could carry a room just by standing in it. She set the fragment down. She walked out of the cradle under her own electricity. He felt his own knees want to fail from relief and kept them for later.

The city did not clap. It didn’t know. That was right. In a week Poppy-9 would take the fragment into a laundry and teach three machines to use it when a breaker was on the verge of sulking. She would not call it a miracle. She would call it a job. He would hear about it as rumor, in the braided voices of neighbors, and he would go stand outside the laundromat for a minute and smell heat and detergent and the human justice of coin.

The ration station went dark during a storm, and the volunteers brought out candles that made the night look like nostalgia until the wind made them less useful. He stood there with his mouth closed and counted with a severity that felt like a muscle after convalescence. The children counted too, not because it was adorable but because it was work. The fans settled into a beat that needed no word and the square rediscovered that petty kindness counts as actual arithmetic. After, someone handed out slices of bread, not in proportions adequate to a sermon, but enough to remind a person that bodies and meaning were not enemies. He ate a piece that tasted like flour and hands and wanted another and took it without apologizing to an imaginary audience.

The angle-shape visited the cradle again in a way that made the room’s graphs behave like rain on a pond. Lin stayed very still, as if the signal disdained people who fidgeted. Kiera folded herself into the corner of the table like a blade returning to a sheath that fit whether or not it was fashionable. He put his hand on the mesh and felt the hum step back as if in deference. The beat that wasn’t his matched, briefly, the rate the city had agreed upon that week, and he felt an inclination toward superstition he gently refused. He said, out loud, because sometimes being stupid is the only way to be honest, thank you. The room did not correct his grammar.

The councilwoman came to see the Hush Room and refused to sit in it. He liked her more for that. She stood in the doorway and let the hum catch her face in the manner of a person at the edge of a lake considering whether they are a swimmer. She asked him how they were going to keep people from charging tickets for standing in corners where breath became easy. He said they would fail sometimes and remind people the library exists and make the doors hard to monetize without getting thrown out. She said she could work with that. She lowered her voice and told him that a company in a neighboring city had filed a patent for “resonant wellness loops” and the phrase made his mouth dry. He wrote it down and then crossed it out on the paper the way you erase a word you don’t want in your house.

Una sat on his counter with her feet on the stool rung and a bowl of soup between her knees. They had both learned to be unromantic about feeding themselves and to treat salt with a respect that was not inherited. She told him she had recorded a song in the radio station’s broom closet by accident because nobody had booked it and the chord sounded better in there than in the studio. He told her the word had entered a machine’s mouth without turning it into a church. They looked at each other like adults doing very well at not becoming children under the pressure of being necessary. She asked if he was going to Iuvenis tomorrow. He said yes and the lock knocked lightly against his sternum like a neighbor in need of flour.

On the beach, the sand took his finger like an instrument it had been tuned to last week and then forgotten with dignity. He drew the braid and then half of the seed and then put his hand flat and refused to have an idea. The angle-shape paged through light and found a grammar they had begun to share. It showed him—how else to say it—a frame. Not architecture; not those clean, white rooms he had always thought you needed to build in order to house anything important. A frame of rope. A frame of wood. A frame of bodies. An understanding that you build a shape and then step away and let it be hammered by weather until it knows what it is. He felt what he had felt in his dream of the two chairs—that there would be rooms where you could sit with an angle and not be asked to either worship or fear, and the work of making those rooms was not someone else’s job.

He came back with sand in the lines of his hand and told Kiera and Lin that the planet had taught him how to build cheap and good. Kiera did not ask him to cost it out. Lin did not ask him whether the ratios were proprietary. For a moment, an uncharacteristic one, they both looked at him as if they were his mothers and he had walked in from an afternoon spent exactly the way they would have advised if anyone ever listened. He set the picture down on the table, and the table accepted it without looking like it expected great guests to eat off it.

There was an evening the square was almost empty. It should have been sad. It felt like a person coming home to a kitchen with a clean counter after a long day and knowing the work had been done and the world wasn’t going to ask for a show. Poppy-9 came by with her ribbon reduced to two brave threads and showed him the small tin she had hung around her neck: inside it a scrap of felt with the braid stitched by Marnie’s hand. It smelled like laundry and irons and cheap perfume and skill. He told her he had an extra lock if she wanted to carry something heavy and she told him her hands were full with needles and that locks were for people who still thought doors had only two states. They stood under a sky that had finally decided it could be cold without apologizing. They counted to four because four had been good to them, and then she told him a joke she had learned from a bus driver that was so old it achieved newness in translation.

On a morning that felt like a favor, the clinic down the block sent a note with a picture of their Hush Room. Someone had hung a paper whale from the ceiling. Someone had drawn the braid on the wall with crayon. Someone had left a loaf of bread on the shelf and a note under it that read TAKE A SLICE AND TELL SOMEBODY THE STOVE IS A CHOIR. He stood there with the lock warm and counted how many good things could fit in a room no bigger than a confessional. He did not use the word. He didn’t need to. The city had taken the hum for itself and, for now, was being careful with it. That would not last forever. They would fail and learn and patch and learn and fail. He walked to the lab with the discipline of someone who has decided to take boredom seriously. In the hallway the elevator cleared its throat and chose silence. He pressed the button and when the doors opened he stepped in with the affection of a man who knows that small machines can teach you more about mercy than new gods.

By the end of the week the bill had passed with enough dissent to keep everyone honest. Hush Rooms got their budget line. The commons license would be challenged and defended and misused and repaired. The film threaded into people’s evenings and then fell out of the trending bar and lodged in a small number of chests where useful things tend to hide after the news cycle tires. The drones sent back another cylinder smelling faintly of something that did not mind us yet. Cain took a still of him not speaking during a blip and put it at the end of the film and people argued like people argue when they have been asked not to buy something. He went to Dr. Marin and confessed, ridiculous, that he missed being simple. They told him to put his hand on the pine and count the rings he could not see. He did. It took three breaths longer than shame had predicted. He slept the kind of sleep that accepts no bargains.

The next morning a child rang the bell at the sewing table and asked if they could make a mat in the shape of a lock. Marnie turned to him with a look that said don’t you dare ruin this with metaphor, and he didn’t. He threaded a needle. He tied a knot. He laid the felt on his knee and stitched with a clumsy tenderness that made Poppy-9 do the small intake sound again, the one she had made in the cradle when the fragment had behaved like manners. The square hummed in a key it had chosen. Somewhere in the lab, the cradle remembered a beat and did not panic about it. The city carried on counting. He carried on keeping his mouth from ruining a day. The lock sat against his sternum and learned, slowly, that there are doors that are better for being left ajar.
