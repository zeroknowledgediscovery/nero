They turned the lights down so the audience could pretend they were invisible. That was the first lie, the first mercy. Everyone sat with their faces half in shadow, half in the glow of the omnipresent blue bulbs that hummed with a medicated sleepiness, and the laughmeter in the corner kept count in soft clicks. Above us the street guardeds — you never saw them unless they wanted you to, but you felt them in the ceiling. Felt them in your bones when you tried to tell the wrong kind of joke. The basement smelled of stale yeast and old applause.

I put both hands around the microphone like it was a warm cup of something. “So, I got a letter from my Aunt this morning,” I said, smiling with my teeth, which the meter liked more than my eyes. “I mean, I got a letter from everyone’s Aunt. I thought we were past this, right? I thought my Aunts agreed to disagree about whether my haircut promotes sedition. But no—apparently, my fringe undermines the civic crib.” A titter. The meter clicked twice. Three times. Not enough to feed anyone, but it meant no one in the back was coughing blood from their throats just for hearing me, and that was something.

You had to talk like the world was a polite inconvenience. You had to act as if the matron’s shoes wove daisies into your path as they walked on your neck. To tell the truth was seditious. To tell a truth you couldn’t prove was a felony. To make laughter when no license had been stamped on your chest was an invitation to a windowless morning.

“So I write back,” I continued, “and I say, Dear Aunt: thank you for your concern. I appreciate you noticing my hairline. It’s flattering, given the pressing matters of governance and the quantified stock of tears. Please accept my humble assurance that, when I wake every morning, the first thing I do is an audit of my follicles for seditious intent. Yours in trembling compliance, J.” A few more clicks, a giggle that had to be forced through a throat that had been learned by years of practice not to giggle at the wrong decibel. The audience breathed like they were apologizing to the air.

In the front row there was a woman with a scarf that looked like something from an older century—dust, roses, a warp nobody could afford. She watched me without blinking. Everyone here could be watching for the Aunts. Everyone here could be an Aunt. Everyone here was trying to forget that they had an Aunt. There are too many ways to hold a person's fear; you’d think the ruling class would pick one and stick with it, but no: variety is the spice of oppression. Ease of control.

“Anyway,” I said, “the city’s calmed down since they reopened the Care Courts for the summer. I love that. Seasonal justice. It’s so quaint. In the winter we knit. In the spring we plant. In the summer we decide who gets to be a person. It’s like being pecked to death by an etiquette book.”

Now we were rolling, or something like rolling. The laughmeter spun; it lit like a small saint. A man in the back slapped his knee and then flinched, as if he had struck a bell one too many times in a temple where the God was awake. I took the opportunity to drink water from a chipped glass. It tasted like an apology for not being something else. I pretended to swallow. The water pretended to go down.

The woman with the scarf smiled without showing her teeth. It made me think of childhood meals eaten with my hands in my lap, my mouth already full of rules.

My name is Jax Quinn—short for nothing, because I never belonged to anything you could lengthen me into. I tell jokes underground so that the city has something to be ashamed of. I used to think I told them for food and the damp half-love of strangers, but I learned, in the long nights when no one laughs and there is only the hum of the bulbs and the weight of the room like a second skin, that I tell them to hear a kind of noise that isn’t instructions. Something that breaks the script. Something we never get on paper anymore. Something that says we are here together and not entirely devoured.

They were devouring us, you understand. Not “women.” Women were trying to live. Some of them wore uniforms. Some of them wore fear like a hand-me-down. The Matronate had many faces and they were all well-lit. They called themselves the Care. The Mothers. The Grand Council of Veils. I called them “you.” Quietly. In my chest. In the way I didn’t kneel straight enough. Power is a hungry geometry; it keeps making shapes out of you.

“So forgive me,” I said, “if I don’t know which spoon to use when a Regent offers me a bowl of salt and calls it stew. I should have studied more. I should have learned the difference between State Salt and the Passion of Soup.”

That brought something like laughter. Not the wild eruption that tears open a day and lets light in, no—the safe cough of amusement, the one you can fold into your pocket and unfold later when you need to demonstrate healthy compliance. Laughter was a ration, like anything else. I knew how many jokes I could tell before someone in the crowd’s throat decided this was an improper use of oxygen. I knew the exact length of a safe swallow. I knew too much about not enough.

After the set, in a back room that smelled like the past tense of smoke, I sat alone and waited for the breathing to slow down in the hall. There’s always a little tremor after. Bodies remembering they can do two things at once: listen and be afraid. The bandage of sound comes off and everyone checks their skin.

“Mr. Quinn,” said a voice from the doorway, a voice made of thread pulled taut.

I looked up. The scarf woman. Up close, the scarf was less romance and more road map: there were seams you couldn’t see until you were allowed near them. She eyed the room like it was a memory she did not trust herself to have.

“I’m closed,” I said. The joke landed limp. I didn’t have my lights on. I didn’t have my face on. The post-show you is the ugliest, however pretty you can act.

She stepped in anyway, closing the door behind her with a soft latch that said, I know how to break things without making sound. “Names: Noema,” she said. “You don’t have to call me that, but I don’t have another one to give you.”

“Are you with the reality-based community, Noema?” I grinned. “Because I can’t afford that cover charge. I was thinking of joining the Liars Union; the benefits are incredible.”

She didn’t smile. Her eyes were the color of the cheap tea that came in rations, but they were not cheap. She wore a grey jacket that fit too well to be government, too poorly to be rich. She had the kind of stillness you only get by attending to a thousand noises and choosing to listen to none of them. I recognized the type: someone who has survived.

“I’m with the Widow’s Circuit,” she said.

I’d heard the name whispered, like addicts whispering brands. The Widow’s Circuit: a network of people too smart to call themselves rebels, too stubborn not to be. They kept the stories that weren’t allowed. They wired grief from house to house, made it hum, taught it to light lamps.

“And?” I said, trying too hard to seem like I had options. My hands were empty. They were always empty. They clung to invisible rails.

“And I need you. Not your jokes, though those are fine. I need your blood.”

“You’ll have to join a club,” I said. “The one where people drink it by the pint and call it childcare.”

Noema took something out of her pocket and set it on the table. It was a photograph—a real photograph, not a render or a permissioned image. Paper, color leached half away by time, smell of old glue. A woman stood in a doorway, hair pinned up with the severity of a day that had seen too much. Behind her, a house with a porch sagging in the middle like a tired mouth. The woman was holding a red scarf and looking at it as if it were bleeding.

I felt the room drop an inch. I had been holding my breath for years, and then I realized I’d been doing it, which is worse. “That’s a common face,” I said, because when your heart recognizes something your tongue does paperwork to hide it.

“It’s your grandmother,” Noema said.

Of course it was. The word grandmother was a dangerous instrument in this city, like a blade you could only sharpen by whispering into it. Grandmothers were how the regime counted itself. They were the almanacs of blood and law; every statute was planted in a garden of matrilines, watered by a rigorous accounting of who came from whom, who was allowed to laugh in which season, who belonged to what season of forgiveness. A grandmother named you. A grandmother un-named you. A grandmother’s name was the second-most holy thing after the quiet humming of obedience in the street.

“I don’t have one,” I said. “They gave us all Aunts.”

“They gave you Aunts because they had to hide the Mothers from you,” she said. “They hid you from her. Both protections. Both prisons.” She tapped the edge of the photograph with a fingernail that had been cut blunt for work. “Her name is Elsin Reed. She birthed your mother. She birthed the first draft of the Cradling Edict, if you believe rumor, which I never do unless I have to. She is alive.”

“Alive?” I heard my voice going tinny around the edges, as if the air had to be hammered into it. “How old does that make her? A hundred? More?”

“Perhaps you misunderstand the way some people are permitted to live,” Noema said evenly. “They live like buildings. Their bones are civic property. They are maintained.” A small shrug. “And perhaps you do not yet understand the way this city works—that alive is a complicated word.”

“She’s a Regent?” My mouth formed the word like it hadn’t been allowed to. “I mean—”

“She is something older than Regent,” Noema said. “Older than the Care. You could call her a root. They have trimmed her into a figurehead because it is easier to worship a portrait than a person. She still breathes.”

“Great,” I said. I tried to make it a joke, but my ribs weren’t in the mood. “So why come to me? I’m a man with a license to smile crooked in basements. Do you want me to roast her? ‘Elsin Reed walks into a bar—’”

“I want you to kill her,” Noema said.

The room made no sound except for a single drop of something somewhere doing the work of gravity. My mouth dried like I’d swallowed chalk. The photograph on the table went grainy under my eyes and then snapped back into focus without my permission. There are sentences that drive you out of your body; my body had a good head start.

“You want what,” I said, carefully. The words were eggs I could not drop. “No offense, but my calendar is full of lesser crimes. I’m booked solid for the next decade with mouthy misdemeanors.”

“Someone has to break the root,” Noema said. “The rest is pruning. We do not cut gardens here. We cut names. We cut stories. They cut you down to a joke. You sharpened yourself to a point for them. Do you want to be more than a nail?”

“I want to be left alone,” I said, which was such an obvious lie it almost sprouted wings and flew across the room. “Or at least I want to control the terms of my un-aloneness.”

“You want the same thing every person under the sky wants,” Noema said. “You want your breath to belong to you.” She glanced at the photograph. “You cannot have that while she breathes.”

“She’s a little old to be choking anyone,” I said.

Noema’s smile, when it finally came, was like the open of a book with too many pages missing. “I do not mean her hands. I mean the kind of breath that a name takes from the air around it.” She leaned forward, flattening her palms on the table. Her hands were scarred—but not from a kitchen. From making things that were not supposed to exist. “And you. You are the only one who will be allowed near her.”

“Right,” I said. “Because—what? Blood. Because she’s my—” The word curdled. “If she’s an antique of the State, she’s got layers of protection. Protocol. A dozen Care Circles between her and a basement rat like me.”

“You already know how to go places you aren’t supposed to,” she said. “You’ve done it for years. With your voice. With your jokes that aren’t jokes. Besides.” She made a small gesture, a peel of the hand. “You are going to die if you keep doing this. They will arrest you when the quota for mercy fills, or for free if they are feeling poetic. Your death will teach no one anything. This death might teach the city to breathe.”

There was a pause in which I counted the scuffs on the floorboards. There was a pause in which Noema waited like a person whose car was stalled at an intersection and did not want to ask for a push. Then I said: “What’s the catch?”

“The catch is this: you cannot tell a joke that will fix what’s wrong without killing your grandmother,” she said. “The catch is that the world will not permit neatness. The catch is that you get to decide whether you want to live long enough to be morally symmetrical.”

“You make it sound like a lottery,” I said.

“It is a lottery,” she said. “The difference is that for once, the number might be yours.”

We sat. The photo on the table reflected the blue light over our heads in a way that made it seem like a pond, like I could fall into it ankle-first and not get out until morning. I kept waiting for the part where she said, By the way, this is a test. We’re recording. Smile for your Aunts. It didn’t come. We were too deep underground for that. The microphones were above us like stars that had forgotten their names.

“How?” I asked at last. “Even if I wanted to, even if everything in me that is cowardly shriveled up and died tonight, how?”

“We have a door,” she said. “Two doors, actually.” She pointed to my chest. “One of them is already in you. The other is made of wood.”

I laughed because I didn’t know what else to do with the air. “Doors. Sure. That seems like the right amount of metaphor. Let me guess: knock and the devil answers.”

“No,” she said quietly. “Knock and you do.”

That should not have made sense. It made a kind of sense that felt like finding a coin in your pocket you were sure you had spent. It did not make me feel better. It made me feel like there were price tags attached to everyone’s faces.

“When?” I asked, because the way she looked at me said weeks had become a more expensive unit than hours.

“Soon,” she said. “Before winter. Before the city decides you belong in a place where the laughs are measured in screams.” She reached out and slid the photograph toward me. “Take this. Consider the shape of your grandmother’s mouth. Ask yourself what it made. What it un-made.”

I held the photograph at the edges. The woman in the doorway was not looking at the camera. She was looking at the red scarf in her hands like she was measuring it against a memory of someone’s throat. Noema watched me watch it.

“I’ll think,” I said.

Noema nodded. She stood. At the door she paused. “You have noticed, I assume,” she said, “the ways in which you are left out of certain rooms. The way certain doors do not admit you. The way machinery prefers to forget your weight.”

“You mean the part where guards walk past me more than they should?” I tried another smile. “I figured it was because I was short.”

Noema said my name like a curse and a blessing. “Jax,” she said. “Do not be too proud to see what you are.”

She left. The room took a breath. I sat with the photograph on my knees and listened to my pulse sound like someone else walking down a hallway. The meter on the wall—a secondhand thing, stolen from a club that had been repurposed into a clinic—ticked for a while and then died.

On my way home, the city wore midnight like a coat it couldn’t afford. The lamps hummed; the drones stitched lines between them, knitting up a sky that refused to tear. I kept my head down, which was what you learn unless you make a living pretending not to know how to. At the corner of Vesper and Sorrow there was a kiosk where they sold legal bread at illegal prices, and a woman with a very tired face served me something like food. “Don’t laugh,” she said automatically, a phrase like second nature, like asking someone’s name. “Not out loud.”

“That’s my whole job,” I said, because I didn’t know how to stop.

She shrugged one shoulder like it weighed more than the other. “Find a different one,” she said softly, and handed me change I hadn’t paid.

Men watched from doorways like cats trying to remember a room where they were allowed. A girl skipped rope beneath a tree that had been legislated into obedience; its leaves were the correct green, its shadow the correct shape. I walked past two Caretakers in uniform, their boots making prayerful sounds against the pavement. They didn’t look at me. They looked at the space where I had been a moment after I left it.

Once, a pair of Aunts—handlight sharp, hair netted like thunderheads—passed so close I could see the reflection of my own face in their shoulder badges. The reflection did not quite match my movements. It was a fraction of a breath off. I told myself it was the glass, the polish, the angle, the ghost of the blue bulbs on the street making everything a half-beat late. People see things, I told myself, when they want explanations more than they want the truth.

My building was a good liar. From the street it looked like it would collapse at the first hard question. Inside, the stairs were solid as sermons. I lived above the old theater—The Lyric, which hadn’t sung in a decade except in a kind of static. The door to my rooms was made of wood that remembered other hands. It stuck when rain came. Tonight it gave way like it knew I needed to get in.

“Sir Edward,” I said, and the cat opened one eye like a banker. He had been mine since he decided I was his. He was grey and disdainful and loved me with the kind of patience you extend to a person who will always be late. He lifted his head an inch to thank me for still being alive enough to feed him, then put it down again when I disappointed him by thinking.

I set the photograph on the mantel. I didn’t turn on the lamps; I let the street do that. All this blue. I used to associate blue with summer. Now I associated blue with the careful management of emotions. I stood in the room and felt the walls do what walls do in a city like this: hold up the roof and record your breathing for later.

“You ever meet your grandmother, Sir Edward?” I asked. He yawned. I took it as noncommittal. “Mine is a political problem.”

I took paper from the drawer. I took ink. I started to write jokes about soup and aunts and the way people say “I’m fine” like a password that lets them into the next hour. I wrote until the words went thin, until the ink went purple against the blue light and looked like horizons I hadn’t seen in a while. Every now and then the floor creaked as if someone else were in the room. Old buildings sound like that. They inventory you.

At some point I fell asleep in the chair. I dreamed I was in a room with fifty doors, each one made of a different thing—glass, bone, sand, rain—and someone on the other side whispered, Pick the one that already knows you. In the dream I reached for wood, because wood remembers more kindly. In the dream the handle turned itself. In the dream my hand went through.

In the morning I woke with the taste of copper on my tongue and the cat watching me as if I had said something unforgivable in my sleep. The photograph on the mantel had tilted. The woman’s scarf seemed more red than it had; it pulsed in the corner of my eye like an emergency. I washed my face. The mirror in the bathroom gave back a version of me that was all edges. I said my name out loud. It sounded like an apology.

I went out because you have to. The city was already at work on itself. There was a line at the registry for permission to be seen. There was a line for bread. There was a line for forgiveness. There was a line for lines. By the square, the Care Court was in session, summer in its mouth. The chairs were filled with a handful of people and the rest were filled with fear; the Aunts at the perimeter wore that blank radiance that uniforms give you when you stop pretending.

On the dais, a Caretaker read charges from a script that had been written to be both sympathetic and unforgiving. A man with a poet’s fingers stood trembling. He had written someone a love letter that compared her laugh to the sound of rain on the roof of a car. The problem was that rain on cars had been outlawed as an image associated with restless mobility. The problem was that you’re not supposed to compare anyone’s anything to anything else unless a Regent has approved the category. The problem was that he had used the word “you.”

“Intent?” the Caretaker asked, in a voice that could knit a wound or a noose.

“To be human,” he said, and the court did not laugh. I almost did. He had the bad taste to tell the truth. The bad manners.

A woman I recognized as Seren Vale stood at the side like a slip of smoke. Seren was not officially anyone. She was not uniformed. She wore black because she wanted to look like a shadow people loved. Rumor said she wrote half the words that came out of the Care’s mouth and had thrown away twice as many. Rumor said she had a daughter who was older than she was. Rumor said she had a kitchen drawer full of spoons that fit no mouths. Rumor was a kind of prayer people had learned to do without kneeling.

As the proceedings droned on, our eyes found each other. Seren and me. There was a flicker of recognition there that made me feel unsheltered. I had made a joke once about her shoes, years ago, and she had smiled with her shoulders. Nobody had arrested me afterward. I had thought then: mercy. Now I thought: Someone got distracted.

When the sentence came down—three weeks reconditioning, then community laughter service in a monitored venue—I left. I couldn’t stay and watch the unmaking. If you watch every time, you end up waving, and I’m not polite enough to help.

Back at the Lyric, a note had been slipped under my door. It was plain paper with no letterhead, which was a letterhead of its own kind. It said: 8 tonight. House of Milk. Bring nothing but the photograph, and the part of you that keeps waking up when it should stay still.

House of Milk. The orphanage. Where boys were sorted into categories: good, compliant, not yet useful, likely to resist. Where girls were taken out through other doors and taught that their hands belonged to the State until their hands learned it. Where I had spent two winters learning to be a polite absence. The idea of going back made my stomach do its old coin trick—flip, disappear.

“Absolutely not,” I told the empty room. Sir Edward did not look impressed.

At seven-thirty I put on my jacket. The photograph went into my pocket like a wound I could fold. I left the lamps off and the cat did not bother to see me out.

The House of Milk had been shuttered for five years, ever since the Grand Council realized it could process children more efficiently by sending them to smaller, more anonymous buildings. The old house stood with its windows boarded and a faded mural on the side where a smiling bowl poured milk into a smiling mouth. The bones of it smelled like sad cloth. The yard was filled with things no one took: a broken bench, a sky the wrong size, the memory of a swing.

Noema was waiting in the shadow of the front steps. She didn’t speak until I was close enough to see that she had cut her hair since last night. It made her look younger and more dangerous.

“You came,” she said.

“I’m a moth,” I said. “You’ve got a big light.”

She regarded me in silence. “You sure you want to do this?” she asked. “You can still forget me. We can both wake up tomorrow and pretend this night fell down a well.”

“And then what?” I asked. “I go back to my basement and time collapses politely around me?”

“Then you keep living,” she said. The word living had quotation marks around it in her mouth.

“Where’s the wood door?” I asked, because certain sentences can only be carried so far.

She led me up the steps and into a vestibule where the ghosts of shoes had made permanence in dust. We passed the old office where a woman in a blue skirt had once kept a ledger of my sins. We passed the kitchen where I had learned that hunger was an instrument. We passed walls where alphabet letters had been painted and then scraped away, leaving children’s mouths without vowels.

At the back of the corridor a small door crouched underneath the stairs. I recognized it but couldn’t remember what for. A handprint small as a star had been stamped above the knob in something dark that might have been paint. Noema put her palm on the wood. She closed her eyes. The hinges sighed.

“It always opens for you?” I asked.

She shook her head. “Open it.”

I reached out. The handle was cold in a way that was not just temperature. Under my skin, the door seemed to recognize me, and also to forget me, and also to be surprised. I turned. The door did not push back. It swung, and a burst of air rose from the darkness like something exhaled at last.

Beyond the door there was a set of stairs falling down into the cellar, and beyond that there was a room with a shape that didn’t fit the building. I can’t explain that without sounding mystical. You know when you step into a place and your bones say: this was not built for this? Not for feet, not for hands, not for eyes? It was like that, but it was also like standing in the middle of a joke that has not found its punchline yet. The room hummed, soft and insistent. A table stood in the center. On it, a box made of a wood that was too warm to be old.

Noema went to the table and touched the box with a familiarity that was not affection. “The second door,” she said.

“What is it?” I asked.

“Something that was built by people who are not very good at obeying,” she said. “A conduit. A simple thing for walking across the part of time that likes to pretend it is a wall. You could call it a grave if you wanted to be romantic.”

“You said I didn’t have to be romant—”

She cut me off with a look. “And you said you wanted to be left alone. Words will not save us.”

She motioned me closer. I could feel the wrongness of the room on my skin now, like windless wind. The box had a handle. The handle had a groove for a thumb. It matched mine, which made my breakfast decide it wanted to test the structural integrity of the box. I kept it in place by thinking about math.

“You’re going to open it,” Noema said. “When you do, it will do what it does. Don’t try to name it while you are inside it. Names get sticky. Once you come out, you will be somewhere you have already been. You will know what to do. Not because I have told you. Because you are a person, and people know what to do in rooms where the air is made of old songs.”

“That’s a lot of faith,” I said.

“It is not faith,” she said. “It is the thing that keeps waking up when it should be tired.”

“And after?” I asked. My mouth felt like I was chewing pennies.

“After, if you are still walking, you will come back,” she said. “And we will stitch together the world around the hole you made.”

“And if I’m not—”

She didn’t answer.

“Why me?” I asked suddenly. The question had sat under my tongue all day like a splinter. “You didn’t answer. Why not one of your Circuit? Why not someone who believes better than I do?”

Noema’s face altered by half a degree. “Because she will see you,” she said. “Because you already look like someone who has died.”

There it was, dropped like a coin in a quiet church. The words bounced, rolled, disappeared under a pew. I wanted to say, What? I wanted to laugh like I could turn the sentence back into a noise. I wanted to grab her by the shoulders and ask her what she meant, as if she could tell me with a mouth. Instead I put my thumb in the groove of the handle.

The wood was warm. There was no sound when the lid opened, only a sensation like all the air in the room remembered something important at once. The inside of the box was dark in that thorough way that only things that have been trained are dark. It felt like a throat. It felt like something waiting, not because it had to, but because it was kind.

I thought of the photograph in my pocket. I thought of the woman in the doorway with the red scarf and the mouth made for making laws out of breath. I thought of the city wearing its blue lights like shackles and jewelry. I thought of my grandmother as a political problem. I thought of the part of me that tells jokes because it cannot scream. I thought of a room where the alphabet has been scraped off the wall and children have to call to each other using only the shapes of their hands.

“Wait,” Noema said, just as the air tried to decide whether it could sit back down. “One more thing.”

I looked up. She looked like a person who had remembered the weight of a word at the last moment. “Whatever you see,” she said, “do not look for your reflection. If you see it, do not trust it. It is old—it belongs to someone else.”

“I barely trust me now,” I said, because I didn’t know what else things were for except wrong responses at the wrong time.

I put my hand in. The wood did not resist. The air inside was not air; it was the shape of the space a body takes up after it has left, which is a fancy way of saying I felt pulled apart and left intact. I closed my eyes because when you don’t, the pictures insist. The moment before I went all the way in, I heard Noema say, very softly, like a person lighting a candle for someone else’s birth: “Come back if you can.”

Then: falling and not. Then: a rush of cold that was in the bones of thoughts, not muscles. Then: the sound of my name being said from very far away, in the voice of someone I had never met but had been waiting for since the laughmeter learned my breath.

When the world decided to assemble itself again, it picked a narrow corridor that smelled of soap and cold broth. I knew it. The House of Milk again, but different. Not boarded, not broken. Children’s voices upstairs, a woman singing an old tune about a river that legally does not flow anywhere near here, footsteps like the tapping of a spoon against a glass.

I stood there and I knew two things.

One: it was the part of time that had insisted it was a wall, only now it wasn’t.

Two: my hand was inside someone else’s. I could not see them. I could feel it, like the warmth of a joke told well—communication made hands. It did not frighten me until I remember that Noema had said, Do not look for your reflection.

I went down the hall because going up felt like sunshine and I don’t trust sunshine given for free. A door opened onto a kitchen, and there she was, stockinged feet, black dress swept back at the sleeves, the red scarf thrown over a chair as if it were a casual thing and not a signal.

The photograph had not lied. The years had, but the photograph had not. Elsin Reed hummed, the melody twisting on itself like a road to get lost on. She saw me and she smiled. The smile was the shape of a key.

“You’re late,” she said, as if I were a boy coming in from a chore, as if she had been expecting the particular shape of air that I had stolen.

“I don’t know what time it is,” I said. My voice sounded like it had been packed in straw. “Or what day.”

“It’s always the day that’s next,” she said. “This is the part where we see if you can keep your hands steady.”

She turned her back to me and started to pour milk from a pan into a bowl. Her throat was bare. It looked like the moment before a word. The scarf on the chair offered itself to my hand by existing. It would be easy. It would be—nothing is easy. Nothing is easy but the lies you make and the lies you permit.

I took one step toward her. The floor croaked like an old frog. Elsin did not turn. The hand that was not mine squeezed mine. Someone else’s hand. Someone who had waited here. Someone she had been expecting. The room hummed like the box had hummed. I told myself the hand was my courage holding me steady. I told myself the hand was a door. I told myself many things at once.

“Jax?” Elsin said. She said the name like she had earned it. “You’re shaking. We get that from your grandfather. Well. From one of them.”

I took the scarf from the chair. The red of it seemed louder than anything I had ever heard. My breath made a noise like a moth against glass. Outside the children laughed and then didn’t.

“Do you know what I’m here to do?” I asked, because sometimes a person will say the thing you cannot think and then you don’t have to.

“Of course,” she said, and there was such sadness in those two words that my bones lost their structure for an instant and then learned it again. “And do you know what I am here to do?”

“What?”

“Forgive you,” she said. “Because the city chose for us before we were born and that is the poorest joke I have ever heard.”

The hand in mine squeezed again, harder. The room brightened or dimmed. My chest forgot how to be a chest. I raised the scarf.

It was then that the mirror over the sink caught me. It didn’t want to. It was trying to look at the window. It was trying to reflect the jar of spoons, the dishcloths, the domestic phase of tyranny. But it caught me because the room insisted. It caught me and it did not find anything.

I saw Elsin, framed, old and young at once. I saw the scarf like a streak of river in a field. I saw the hallway behind us, a reach of air. I saw no one where I stood.

My body made the wrong decision. It froze. The hand in my hand went cold. Elsin, who was not a careless person, turned then. She saw me. She looked at the air where I was. She did not change expression.

“You finally noticed,” she said.

And I, very slowly, let the scarf fall back onto the chair.Elsin’s mouth changed, not shape so much as intention. It softened in a way that did not excuse anything, a way that acknowledged time like a fellow conspirator you can’t turn in without turning yourself. She set the pan down with a care that told me she had never in her life dropped a thing unless she intended to see where it broke. The smell of warm milk rose and braided itself through the kitchen, and if memory were a rope I would have climbed it back to a night when I was hungry and someone put a cup in my hand and said, Drink this, boy, it’s the closest thing to kindness we’re allowed.

“You finally noticed,” she said again, and when she stepped toward me the hand in my hand tugged, not to keep me or push me but to remind me that I had a hand. It’s a particular sort of miracle, remembering what you’re made of while someone is looking at you like you might vanish if she blinks.

“I thought it was the glass,” I said. It sounded defensive and schoolboy, which was not the mask I wanted, which means of course it was the mask I had. “The polish. The angle. The way the city leans.”

She glanced at the mirror as if it had spoken out of turn. “They taught the glass to forget you,” she said. “They taught a great many things to forget you. It’s efficient.”

“They?” I asked, though I could have filled in the pronoun with a chorus of titles. “You?”

She did not flinch. “I wrote a paper,” she said. “A suggestion, really. An application of an old law to a new problem. We had too many boys with nowhere to put them, and the old houses did not have enough shadows. The solution was to expand the jurisdiction of forgetting. To make a grace out of absence. If we could not kill them without spilling the wrong kind of blood, we could teach the city to misplace them. A person without mirrors collects fewer enemies.”

“And fewer friends,” I said, and there was the old taste of iron, the place in my mouth where I stored opinions it was illegal to swallow.

Elsin nodded as if I had helped her with an arithmetic. “Yes,” she said. “Yes. It is not a kind thing. It was not meant to be. It was meant to hold until a better world came to claim you.”

“And it didn’t.” It came out like accusation and hunger and something dirtier, too—hope that had not yet figured out how to sit down without making a scene.

Her eyes were clever and tired. “Not for you,” she said. “Not in time.”

The hand in my hand warmed again, as if whoever had it had remembered to be alive. The skin of it was small. It did not sweat. The bones were fine and insisted upon. I looked down because the temptation was to prove that I was alone, to disprove the only thing keeping me from bolting like a dog. There was nothing to see but the shape of air where fingers might be, the suggestion of knuckles, the polite acceptance of my palm that perhaps, this once, it would not hold nothing.

“You shouldn’t have come,” I said.

Elsin’s laugh was brief and offended on behalf of the universe. “Wherever did you think to say that?” she asked. “To whom, boy? In what kitchen?”

“You know why I’m here,” I said, because if we keep circling the bowl long enough the milk goes sour.

“I do,” she said. “You will not be the first to try and cut a line with a string. You will not be the last. There are always knives in the parts of the city where no one looks.” She stepped close enough that the air between us had to negotiate its existence. Her tone became not kinder but closer, like a hand traveling from a table to a shoulder. “There is a reason we taught the mirrors to forget you and not me, Jax. There is a reason a boy without a face can get through doors a woman with a dozen names could never cross. Did Noema tell you that part? She doesn’t like to dress her truths; she assumes you will find your size without a tailor.”

“She told me there were two doors,” I said. “One in wood, one in me.”

“And did she tell you about the third?” Elsin asked.

My back found the edge of the table. The wood remembered the weight of children’s hands and the pressure of elbows learning what they were for. “Of course there’s a third,” I said, because the world is never done with the joke of three. “Let me guess. It’s in you.”

“My dear,” she said, with a kind of exasperated fondness that made me hate that we shared blood. “You say that like I haven’t been a door all my life. They made me open and shut until the hinges sang. I stood for things. I stood against them. The only thing no one taught me was how to sit down.”

I wanted to reach for the scarf again if only to have a piece of the world that did not argue back. I did not. My hands did that quiet tremble that makes people feel maternal and then makes them nervous that they feel anything at all. Outside, someone shouted a word that was not in the approved vocabulary and someone else shushed them with a fear so practiced it made me sick.

“What are you waiting for?” she asked. “Permission? A benediction? Let us speak plainly. You came into this kitchen to kill a grandmother. You want the world to rearrange itself afterward in a way that will feel like it deserved you. You want a bolt of lightning to travel along the wires of the city and reset the circuits. You want to cut the root and see the tree remember how to be a forest. Is that close?”

“If you’re trying to talk me out of it,” I said, “you could mention that witnesses talk, and I don’t see any blue bulbs here to measure my compliance.”

“I am trying to decide how much of the truth to give you,” she said, which was, in this city, the only proof of love anyone ever got. “You have two choices, and the shape of each is bad. You can kill me and remain what you are now—a crack in the wall, a draft no one admits is making them cold—or you can not kill me and remain alive long enough to learn what I did and why and for whom. In one story, you are an answer. In the other, you are an instrument. The city does not particularly care which. It is good at music and it is good at silence.”

“Why say forgive,” I asked. The word had hung between us since she spoke it, like a towel you cannot get dry. “Why say you were here to forgive me?”

“Because you were,” she said. “Because you are mine, and I gave you to the dark. We put your name in a box and told the devils to keep you safe. The devils are very good at keeping. No one has to pay a tax on what they don’t admit to owning.”

I thought of Sir Edward watching me breathe like an auditor. I thought of Aunts with hair netted like weather and eyes like accurate ledgers. I thought of Noema saying, You already look like someone who has died. I thought of the laughmeter’s small clicks, the way it liked my teeth better than my eyes, the way a machine can count what a human is forbidden to say out loud. My throat felt like its own law.

“I don’t want your forgiveness,” I said, which was true and not, because what I wanted was a world in which I did not need it, which is a kind of greed.

“You will take it anyway,” she said. “It is not mine alone to give. It belongs to the part of the city that has been waiting for you to notice that no mirror will ever tell you how to stand. It belongs to the boys who were told they were drafts and the girls who were told they were doors and the ones who were told they were both in different rooms.”

The hand that held mine shifted. Its fingers were now positioned in a way that suggested impatience, which is a very childlike tactic and also an old person’s. I looked again at the place where a hand would be if the rules were different. Something in the air flexed. For an instant, as quick as the blink of a city official pretending not to see a bribe, the hand resolved enough to catch the light. Small. A scar across the knuckle like a vowel cut out of an alphabet. I knew that scar. I had made it when I tried to circumvent a locked cupboard in this very house with a knife that did not owe me anything. The cupboard had explained offense to my skin. The letter V had been mine for a summer.

“Is that mine?” I asked, and the air did not answer, because it didn’t have to.

Elsin watched me watching the nothing that was a something. “You were not alone,” she said. “We did not simply erase you and leave you to make friends with the drafts. We gave you a companion. We called him by a name that was easy to pass from hand to hand. We called him nothing. He kept you from bumping into doors when the lights were off. Sometimes he persuaded you to bump into them anyway, so you would learn there were other rooms. When you thought you were talking to yourself, you were. But you were also talking to what we left you of ourselves. Consider it an apology in the shape of a boy.”

“You gave me a ghost,” I said, and it sounded too grand for the shabby miracle in my palm.

“We gave you a self that could not be marched,” she said. “Do you think the city does not know how to herd? Do you think the categories are not hungry? We refused to give it all of you. We refused to pour every last thing into their jars labeled BREATH and LAUGHTER and OBEDIENCE. We kept a hand. We kept a shadow. We let it take your reflection and your name. We let it call you Auntless and then we let you make jokes about Aunts until the word meant something else.”

“Did you keep enough?” I asked, and my voice had iron filings in it now.

“That depends on what you decide to do with me,” she said.

I reached for the scarf because decisions prefer props. It lay on the chair like a tongue. The weave of it was dense without being heavy, a technology disguised as tradition. The red was not a red I had seen at market. It had the same kind of authority as a stop sign, as a mother’s hand, as a signature at the bottom of a law. I did not want it to touch my skin. I wanted it to answer me.

“What is this,” I asked. “Aside from cloth.”

“It is a key,” she said. “It opens throats in one direction. It closes them in another. You can make a person quiet forever with it. You can also pull a voice out of a body that has been taught not to speak. The poor joke is that you cannot always choose which way a door will swing after you build it.”

“You made this?” I asked, and her mouth did something that might have been pride if pride could breathe in this house.

“I wrote the specifications,” she said. “I argued for the colors. I stood in a room and said the word compassion until it was empty enough to serve. We sewed them in rooms without windows and we asked the women who sewed them to hum. We told ourselves the hum would make it kinder.” She lifted a hand and stopped it halfway to the scarf, as if remembering that there are boundaries the hands of certain people cannot cross. “I do not know how to make it kinder now.”

I took the scarf in both hands because one makes a different kind of choice when both hands agree. The boy-hand squeezed and did not get in the way. Elsin stood and breathed like someone who had seen a great many people die and had learned to keep her heart quiet during. I put the scarf around my grandmother’s neck, and for a second we became a picture the city would like to hang: obedient grandson, caretaker matron, a bondage that could be called familial if you were feeling generous.

“I will not struggle,” she said.

“That would be helpful,” I said, and the joke came out broken, which is perhaps the best way to smuggle sincerity.

It was a posture, not an act. It was an alignment. The scarf rested in the space where her breath entered, where a name gets its first chance. My hands remembered the alphabet scraped off the wall, the little mouths forming shapes with no letters to fit them. In another room I could hear a baby crying in that alarming, pure way babies have, unlicensed and proud.

“I can’t know,” I said. “I can’t know what it makes or unmakes. You said so yourself. Doors swing.”

“You cannot,” she said. “But I can tell you one thing and not another, and that is the math of mercy. If you do this, someone will take my picture down in a room no one is supposed to be in. Someone will fold a law in half. A few men will be permitted to laugh out loud in the morning. A few women will find their bodies returned to them at a time when they expected to be told to be useful. Many others will not notice anything at all until the next thing. If you do not do this, something slower will happen and it will happen in more rooms. There will be more rooms, Jax. I made this city smaller than it needed to be. I wanted to count everything. Counting is a vice. It feels like godliness. It isn’t.”

The hand that was not mine slid free then, and it was like a small animal deciding that it had other business. It stood at my side and became the rest of me. I did not look because Noema had told me not to. I knew the shape of that boy without mirrors. I had felt him in my elbows when I could not keep still, in my feet when stairs forgot to creak for me, in my mouth when a punchline arrived uninvited and made itself at home.

“When you were born,” Elsin said, “the city had a new idea about men. We had always had ideas. The new one was that men did not need to be people in order to be serviceable. The more we made air into law, the more the air wanted to account for. We were drowning in paper. We were drowning in faces. So we did a cruel arithmetic. We cut you from the sum. It let us balance other books. It let us say we were not killing. We were choosing economies. We were choosing to make women safe by making men small. We were wrong about what smallness does.”

“You wrote the Cradling Edict,” I said, and I did not know why I said it, except that sometimes you have to pin a snake’s name to the table.

“I wrote a draft,” she said. “It grew teeth while it traveled. People put their mouths on it and left bite marks. By the time it was law, it had a thousand mothers. By the time it reached your cradle, it had become a song everyone knew. Songs are dangerous. They go where you cannot.”

We stood like that: me holding her life like a knot that might or might not require human hands; she standing as if she had stood longer than gravity existed; the boy beside me like a gap taught to be an accomplice. My breath came the way breath comes when you have to stack it yourself. Something in the house shifted—the particular creak of the back door, the way light folds when a cloud makes up its mind, the sound a spoon makes when someone sets it down with too much attention.

“Jax?” came a voice from the hall, crisp and offhand, the kind of voice that had been paid to say both please and do it, now. Seren Vale leaned against the kitchen doorframe, as if rooms were furniture she had ordered bespoke. Her hair was tied back with a ribbon so black it took on the blues of the room. She was younger than I remembered her and older than anyone deserved to be while still standing upright. She took in the scene—the scarf; the old woman; the boy-shaped absence that waves if you tell it a story—and she smiled like a reprimand.

“I wondered what year you’d pick,” she said. “We never could keep you out of kitchens.”

The scarf loosened in my hands. The room tightened in theirs. Elsin did not turn her head, which made me realize on a scale beyond kitchen that she had expected Seren and had chosen not to greet her, the way two seasoned criminals choose not to nod at each other in a bank.

“You’re early,” Elsin said, which was either an insult, a fact, or a way of telling the universe to mind its breeding.

“I’m exactly myself,” Seren said. “No more, no less. Hello, Jax. You look thinner without your reflection.” She stepped past the threshold without asking leave, touched the bowl of milk as if it were a lover’s shoulder, and turned to me. “If you’re going to make a hole, darling, make it the right size.”

“I was working on it,” I said, though no one in that room was naive enough to believe me.

Seren’s eyes went to the red scarf and returned to mine. “The thing about knots,” she said, “is that sometimes they hold more than the rope is worth.” She glanced at Elsin. “He does not owe you an uncomplicated death.”

“He does not owe me anything,” Elsin said. “That is the point. He is the one person in this city who does not owe anyone anything. That is why he confuses the locks.”

Seren sighed as if it had been a long day, long week, long life. “I tried to write a law that would understand that,” she said to me. “Do you know what happens to a law like that when other people edit it? They write it on paper that reflects. They say, It will be easier to enforce if we can see ourselves in it. Then they hold the paper up to a mirror and discover the law applies only to people who already have faces.” She spread her hands. “We could stand here and swap regrets like recipes, but the city is hungry and the Aunts are bored. Both are bad conditions.”

“Is this the part where you tell me the off-ramp?” I asked. “The third door, the fourth, the trapdoor in the floor where we store our better selves for emergencies?”

“This is the part where you decide whether you are braver than your jokes,” Seren said. “This is the part where you decide whether killing your grandmother makes a dent or makes a poster.” She looked not at Elsin but beyond her, at the wall with the faint patches where once there had been alphabet, and something like fury—not hot but steady, the kind that knows its own expiration date—passed over her face. “We have been public about the wrong things for so long.”

Elsin’s hands were at her sides, palms open. “He is not your instrument either,” she said mildly.

“No,” Seren said. “He is a conductor. That is worse. He will make people who do not know one another behave as if they do. He will set grief to humming until it becomes a power source.” She turned to me. “You cannot do that with a single corpse, no matter how beloved. You can do it with a verdict. You can do it with a story.”

“What story,” I asked, feeling tired of the word and unable to do without it.

“The one where a city tried to delete you and failed,” Seren said. “The one where a matriarch who invented a particular cruelty died in her bed, old and tended and unpunished, and the city discovered it could not bear the lack of spectacle. The one where you put your hands around her throat and then took them away and walked out of this kitchen and did something much harder in a place with more witnesses.”

“What’s harder,” I asked, though my life had a list and it was long.

“Stand on a stage with the lights full up,” Seren said. “Say your name.” She tilted her head. “Make them see you. Not for a moment. Not as a rumor. Lay claim. You want to kill the root? You will not do it by pruning. You will do it by refusing to be soil.”

Elsin made a sound that might once have been a scoff and now was a prayer’s cousin. “You always did like your revolutions tidy,” she said. “Look around you, child. We trained this place to erase him. The night he says his name in a bright room, the street will eat the light. The Aunts will come with their nets. They will do it with style.”

“They always do,” Seren said. “But the appetite of a city is not a law. It can only eat what is put in its mouth. If he puts himself on the table, they will think they are dining. But if he puts the hunger there? If he shows them the hole we dug where his face should be? If he makes them admit they have been eating absence and calling it policy? It will crack their teeth.”

I had the scarf in my hands and a woman who owned me by genealogy and another who owned me by rhetoric and a boy by my side who owned me by a bond that was either a rumor or a theorem. I had my life like a coin on its edge. It is not the worst position for a coin. It gets to be both for a second you can live in if you are careful.

“What do you want, Jax?” Elsin asked, and the question was so simple I could barely process it.

“To not have to be the thing that fixes what you broke,” I said, surprising myself by telling the truth with both hands.

She nodded, and there was mercy in it that I had not been promised. “All right,” she said. “Then do what she says. Don’t do it because it is neat. Don’t do it because it will make the newspapers tidy. Do it because I broke something and the only way to fix it is to point to the hole in it until enough people fall in and find the other side.”

“And if I fail?” I asked. “If I go up there and say my name and the laughmeter makes a mess of me and the Aunts wrap me up like a gift to themselves?”

“Then you will have died doing something that is not a polite version of terror,” Seren said. “I have told uglier truths to other men for less.”

“Listen to me,” Elsin said, and her voice had the weight of the first time your name is spelled correctly by a stranger. “Take the scarf anyway. There will be a moment when the room thinks it knows who you are. There will be a moment when the air tries to teach you to be a door. In that moment, you will need a rope. Do not think ropes only hang.”

I folded the scarf, which did not want to be folded, and put it inside my jacket where I keep cheap jokes and expensive cigarettes I do not smoke because addiction should be reserved for things that have the decency to be fun. The boy-hand slipped back into mine with a decisiveness that startled me. Seren nodded like a director who had finally convinced a stubborn actor to hit his mark. Elsin looked at me like she had chosen the time and the place and was surprised to find that choice deepening into a story.

“How do I get back,” I asked quietly. The box had hummed in me since I left it. The house had been a throat and I had been a word. I did not know the way to end a sentence, only how to keep trying.

“You are already going,” Elsin said. “That is what people forget about doors. They are not about leaving. They are about returning. It is the return that makes them holy.”

Seren’s mouth crooked. “Walk out the back,” she said. “Turn left. There will be a corridor that did not exist before and will not exist again. That is the perk of being an exception. Try not to fall through anything with a window in it on the way.”

“You’ll be here?” I said, and I did not specify which you because perhaps specificity would have made me choose, and I was not ready to be the kind of man who chooses between the person who invented his erasure and the person who had spent her life making erasures legible.

“For a little while,” Elsin said.

“Until it is necessary to be elsewhere,” Seren added.

I went. The boy-hand tugged like a fish that knows the way to the river. The corridor was where Seren promised, and it smelled like the mouth of a clock. The air cooled as if it had been used by other mouths recently and not yet given back to the room. I did not look into any glass. I did not look for myself. I held my name in my mouth like a match I would need to strike and tried not to lick the sulfur.

When the door under the stairs received me, I was already thinking about the stage as if it were a person. Rooms are people in this city. They have opinions about applicants. Noema stood by the box with her arms crossed in a posture that was not defense so much as infrastructure. She uncrossed them when she saw me and allowed her face one expression: relief like a mistake canceled.

“You’re in one piece,” she said.

“Define piece,” I said. The boy let go of my hand and did whatever it is a part of you does when it has to get small enough to fit under a rib again. “It wasn’t neat.”

“It never is,” she said. She glanced at my jacket. “You brought a souvenir.”

“I brought a rope,” I said, and when I pulled the scarf out, the room darkened as if to make its color less immodest. Noema did not touch it. She looked at it the way a person looks at a gun when they have committed the improper act of wishing they knew how to shoot.

“And?” she asked.

“She wants me to cut her with my mouth,” I said. “Seren wants me to cut the city with it.”

Noema exhaled and it was not laughter. “Seren was always a theatrical woman,” she said. “And Elsin was always good at mannered martyrdom. But they’re not wrong. The box cannot do this again in the same place. You used the door in you to find the door in her. There are economies to these things. We pretend there are not to make ourselves feel like wizards.”

“I did not kill her,” I said, waiting for judgment to drop out of the air like a letter opener.

Noema stepped close and put two fingers under my chin, not to turn my face but to measure whether it belonged to me. “Good,” she said.

“That’s it?” I asked, almost offended. “Good?”

“What do you want,” she asked, “a commendation? A grail? You chose the path that makes me not have to carry your body out of a kitchen. I am grateful in ways I will show you later when we have time for elaborate gratitude. Right now we do not. Right now we have to get you ready to blaspheme properly on a public frequency.”

I thought of the laughmeter like a small saint. I thought of the blue bulbs’ polite tyranny. I thought of the room that smelled of old applause and yeast and the way breath tastes when it has been shared without permission. My mouth remembered the shape of my name when I say it to myself in the bathroom mirror and receive no answer back. There is a lonely kind of courage in making the shape anyway.

“When?” I asked, and the adverb perched on my tongue like something feathered that would prefer to be fire.

“Tomorrow,” Noema said. “Because if we give you longer, you will talk yourself into a smaller story.”

“How many?” I asked.

“As many as we can fit without inviting an immediate harvest,” she said. “We will line the street. We will flood the bulbs. We will rig the meter so that every heartbeat sounds like laughter, and every laugh sounds like a breach.”

“Seren?” I asked.

“She will be where she always is,” Noema said. “Just out of frame. Making sure the wrong people think they’re doing it right. Do you trust her?”

“No,” I said honestly. “Do you?”

“No,” she said, with a satisfaction I envied. “Do you trust me?”

“Yes,” I said, which startled me and probably her.

“Good,” she said, and this time the word had everything in it that had been missing when I said it to her in a basement with the world still thinking it could put me down and I would not bounce. “Eat something. Sleep as if sleep were a place you could go rather than a thing that falls on you. In the morning we will teach you how to walk without reflecting.”

“I already do,” I said. “It’s the only thing I’m good at.”

“No,” she said. “You’ve been practicing erasure. Tomorrow is performance. You will take the thing they stole from you and turn it into a weapon that does not look like one. You will be my favorite kind of thief.”

I left the House of Milk with the scarf inside my jacket and the door under the stairs remembering my hand and the photographs in my pocket licking their chemical lips. The street had the night draped over it like a shawl someone hated. Men watched from their doorways, and this time they did not pretend I was dust. A pair of Aunts passed, and for once their badges did not hurry to lie to me about what my body was doing. Their eyes slid where they had been trained to slide. Behind them, the sky worried itself into an overcast that looked like a discussion among bureaucrats.

Back in my rooms above the Lyric, Sir Edward was on the back of the chair that had learned my shape and did not approve it. He blinked at me as if to say, You came home with a deadline in your pocket. I put the scarf on the mantel next to the photograph and did not turn on any lights that did not hum.

“You’ve been a door,” I told the cat. “How do you deal with people using you all the time without buying a gun?”

He stretched in a long insult and resettled, which is the closest he will ever come to telling me he has done worse and been paid less. I boiled water and made a tea that tasted like an old compromise. I ate bread that took its time becoming a memory. Every creak of the building catalogued my choice. The laughmeter on the wall—the secondhand saint—ticked at me like a metronome trying to teach me how to be brave in time.

I lay down and expected the dream, and was not disappointed. Fifty doors again; all different; all waiting. I went to the one made of wood with the grain that had once been rain and would be again, and put my hand on it and said, Hello. It said my name back. For the first time, it did not startle me.

Morning did not so much arrive as refuse to continue being evening. The city had a borrowed sun; it used it like a colander. People poured through its holes in the prescribed directions. The registry line was already forming curves into shapes that made graphs in the minds of the women who kept track of such pretty suffering. I washed my face and told the mirror nothing. The mirror told me nothing back, which is the most honest thing it knows how to do for me.

When I got to the club, Noema had been busy. The bulbs had been adjusted until their blue leaned toward something no longer tranquil. The laughmeter had grown a second needle and a small bell. On the stage, a microphone waited with the patience of a lover who knows it can get you back. The chairs had been stolen from fifteen different rooms, which meant that fifteen different people would be missing a place to sit tonight, which is how you measure progress in this city: who has to stand.

Seren was there, in the back, looking like a rumor that had decided to be empirical. She did not wave. She nodded tartly the way you commission art you will pretend not to have paid for. Elsin Reed was not there, of course she was not, because if I believed in anything as tidy as that then I might as well stretch my neck out and ask the scarf to make things simple before things got complicated.

“Breathe,” Noema said, and I did, and I hated her for reminding me and loved her for the same. “Remember what you are going to do.”

“I am going to say my name,” I said.

“You are going to say your name and make them admit they have heard it before,” she said. “You are going to make them repeat it to themselves when they lie down. You are going to force this room to host a person the city cannot file. You will do it with timing and with economy. You will do it with a mouth trained to sharpen truth until it passes for laughter.”

“What if no one laughs?”

“Then they will clap, or they will cough, or they will stare,” she said. “Machines count all of those if you teach them. We have taught this one.”

People came. They came the way weather does, with purpose that looks like dithering. They sat. They pretended not to count themselves. They kept their throats in order. The hum came up from the bulbs like a mood. The bell on the meter stayed still.

I went up when I was supposed to. The microphone felt like a warm cup. I put both hands around it because I am superstitious, because the body remembers what saved it last time and asks for the same again and again until you teach it better habits. The room hushed with the enthusiasm of an audience that has promised itself to be kind if it can get mercy for it. I could feel the boy in my chest, alert in the tunnels. I could feel the scarf, a coil against the bone. I could feel a grandmother somewhere making milk, a law somewhere considering whether to be human.

“My name,” I said into the hum, and the word was a blow, a key, a joke, a wound. “Is Jax Quinn.”

The bell on the meter rang once—not loud, not theatrical. A small clear noise like a glass deciding to be part of a toast. The bulbs flickered not because the grid failed but because the idea of me landed on them and they had to adjust the voltage. In the back, Seren’s mouth did a private thing. Noema’s shoulders lost an inch of work. A few Aunts in the corner lifted their heads the way dogs do when someone opens the refrigerator.

“I am here,” I said, because no one had asked and it is rude to make a room do all the work of acknowledgment by itself. “I was not allowed to come. I came anyway. I wasn’t invited to have a face. I brought one from home.”

A few laughs came the way you coax water from a reluctant pump. The meter’s second needle moved. The bell did not ring. My mouth found a rhythm I had been saving for a country that never let me live there.

“What do you get a city that has everything?” I asked. “Feedback. Instructions. Better manners. But I’ll tell you what you don’t get it. You don’t give it my reflection. It’s already got too many of its own.” That got a real response, a ripple that ran the chairs like a cat.

“You know how hard it is to be a person when the glass won’t co-sign?” I said. “They tell you it’s for your safety. They tell you it’s for hers. They tell you stories about men and the way their hands can’t find a pocket without stealing a thing on the way. Meanwhile they teach you to disappear so politely you forget to demand a chair. The first time a woman looks you full in the face and calls you by the right name, you think she’s committed a felony. Then you realize—no. She just declined to file.”

I told them the Aunt jokes and the soup jokes and the Care Court jokes, but I turned the knife, and every turn ended with me saying my name the way an anchor says the harbor. Jax Quinn. It is not a long name. It has no titles. It fits in most mouths. By the third repetition, the room had learned it. You could feel the city trying to decide where to put the sound.

At the edge of my vision, an Aunt in a uniform the color of God’s patience touched the pin on her collar. Her lips moved. Somewhere a machine woke. The bulbs complained and then pretended not to. The bell rang twice, and the meter’s second needle—the one Noema had calibrated last night while I watched the street pretend to be sleep—jumped and held.

“I had a grandmother once,” I said, and that was against several laws, and it was my favorite crime. “I have one now, depending on how time works in a city where seasons are licensed. She wrote me into a box and then made sure the box was lined with a joke that survives earthquakes. I want you to think about the last time you saw your face and believed it. I want you to think about how many people made that possible. I want you to consider that a mirror is only as honest as the law it serves.”

I lifted the scarf. I did it slowly, because speed would have said panic and I needed ritual. The red was a red that had never seen a fruit. The murmur came like a draft. A woman in the second row put her hand over her mouth and then moved it and kept it off. A man near the wall crossed himself with the wrong hand and corrected. The Aunts in the corner stood without standing.

“This,” I said, “is a key. It opens. It closes. Tonight it is going to hold a door for us while we leave our shapes and fetch them back.” I tied the scarf around the microphone stand. It looked ceremonial. It looked like a throat. It looked like a promise. “You are not going to laugh at this. You are going to breathe very loudly in a way that could be confused with laughter by anyone counting.”

They did. They breathed. The bell rang. The meter’s needles kissed. The bulbs were not prepared for the heat of breath. Noema’s mouth was a line and then a river. Seren had her hands on the back of a chair like a woman who expects the earth to throw her and intends to stay on anyway. The Aunts moved closer, the way professionals do when they want to look like accident.

“My name,” I said again, and by now it was not for me. It was for the women who remembered having sons and pretend they had not. It was for the boys who mailed themselves into the wall and waited for replies. It was for the apparatus in the ceiling that had always been convinced it was God and was about to learn it was a chandelier.

“Jax Quinn,” the room said back, and the sound was not a cheer, not a prayer. It was a correction.

There are moments when a city reveals its wiring. You can hear the surge travel, not along the lines you’ve been told about, but through the conduits of habit and rumor and the useful patches of law. Somewhere above us the drones stitched a crooked pattern. Somewhere to my left a fuse made a small death and was reborn with a taste for theater. An Aunt reached for something under her coat that could have been a book or a weapon or a list of sanctioned adjectives. The second needle of the meter pinned itself as if stabbing a map.

The boy in my chest stood up. He took my hand from the inside. He said nothing. He did not have to. The stage tilted in my favor. I kept talking. I made the city hear the shape of me. I did not look for my reflection. I watched as the room learned a new word: present.

By the time the Aunts reached the edge of the stage, too late to arrest the sentence before it ended, I had said my name enough times to make it true. They stood there with their nets, and I showed them a hole. I said, “You taught the glass to forget me. I taught my mouth to remember,” and I touched the red scarf like a flag that did not belong to any of us yet.

The first Aunt to step forward opened her mouth to say the word the city uses when it needs to remind itself what it owns. I did not let her. I said my name over her, and the room said it with me, and the bell rang, and the needle held.

And somewhere, in a kitchen where milk skins while a woman hums an outlaw river, an old law felt its hinge rust.The Aunts reached for me with nets that had names stitched into the knots, and the room stepped between us. Not with fists—those are too honest for this city—but with recognition, which is the country’s most outlawed resource. The bell on the meter kept making its small, immodest sound, and the second needle held like a finger on a page that refused to be turned. I said my name a fourth time and watched it land on their uniforms like dust that can’t be brushed away without admitting you were near a place that collects dust. The scarf glowed up red enough to be remembered by people who think they are immune to color.

“You can’t be here,” said the nearest Aunt, which is what you say to a hurricane if you have never seen a window.

“I keep hearing that,” I said, and when my hands tightened on the stand the scarf cinched itself into a knot that knew the difference between attention and constraint. “It seems to encourage me.”

Her net swung through the air and found instead a shape I have made my whole life: not absence, not presence—expectation. It snagged expectation and held it aloft like a trophy. The audience watched, baffled and then delighted, the way you are when a magic trick accidentally tells the truth.

“Adjourned,” said a voice from the back with the authority of a stamp. Seren didn’t raise her hand, didn’t show a badge—she took a word out of her mouth like a knife and laid it on the table, sharp side up. The Aunts flinched because flinching has been taught to them as a method of returning power to their bodies when language is suddenly used against them. Noema, at my left, tapped twice on the base of the meter with a knuckle she must have bruised doing other work; the bell answered like a co-conspirator.

A hum rose that wasn’t the bulbs. If you’ve ever been caught under a bridge when a train goes over, you’ve felt it in your teeth: the way machinery instructs your skull to vibrate at its frequency. This was the opposite. The room was humming at the bulbs, asking them to sympathize with a different current. They listened because no one had trained them not to. Widow’s Circuit work is always practical first and beautiful only when it can’t help it. Somewhere, someone was turning a crank attached to a spool of grievances. The blue softened toward a bruise.

I did the unfashionable thing then and said other people’s names out loud. Not mine; mine had done its work for a minute. I said names of boys I knew from the House of Milk who had been moved like furniture until they made an empty space everyone pretended was intentional. I said names of men who had been caught reading and thus induced to forget how to eat. I said the names their mothers were no longer allowed to use in kitchens. The audience did what audiences do when given a prompt that does not require permission: they answered. The first two were whispers, arranged politely into a corner where compliance could tidy them later. Then the third came like a cough that had been telling itself not to cough, and the fourth like someone realizing they would not be the only one saying it, and the fifth like a whistle teaches a kettle its job. The scarf on the stand hissed with it, drawing breath out of people who had been dining on silence for years and giving it back to them warm.

One of the Aunts in the corner found her words and dearly wished she hadn’t. “Cease,” she said, and the word was too pale for the room. Someone in the second row said, “Stanley,” and someone else said, “Hector.” Someone in the back said, “Mine,” and then corrected it to “Darren,” and then corrected the correction to, “He didn’t get to pick,” which was not a name but it was a kind of name.

“Stop them,” hissed the nearest Aunt to the other, and reached again with her net. It tangled the red scarf and tightened for a breath and then did what all well-meaning, ill-designed tools do in the presence of their opposite: it learned something about itself and was embarrassed. The mesh loosened like a hand reconsidering a slap. Seren’s mouth curved not in delight, but in that particular human satisfaction that comes from watching a clever machine encounter art.

Noema lifted her chin at me and I remembered to be useful. “If you’re going to arrest me,” I told the Aunts, “you’ll have to write it down. If you write it down, you’ll have to put my name somewhere. If you put my name somewhere, the paper will have to remember me. That’s the beginning of the problem, not the end.”

The first laugh that was not breath came then, hard and involuntary, from a man in a coat that had been his father’s. It hurt him, you could tell, the way relief always does when you forgot you needed it. The meter liked it. The bell agreed. The Aunts fell back into procedure because procedure is the shelter you run to when the weather won’t mind.

“By authority of—” one began, and stopped because the authority in question was having a small electrical accident in the ceiling. The drones overhead were not designed to record names that do not register in glass. They had been chartered to ignore me. They tried, like good instruments; they went fuzzy and then pretended to be birds who had gotten lost indoors. The House had taught me to be grateful for attention; the streets had taught me to survive without it. It is a bad combination for a city’s expensive toys.

Seren’s shoulders calmed by one fraction of an inch. It made a sound in my chest like a page turning. She lifted her hand and drew it through the air in a line that would have been a signature if it had found paper. The Aunts saw the gesture without seeing the instruction in it, which is the only way you survive a day like this if your job is to keep the furniture in place.

“This venue is in violation of—” said another Aunt, and then the power did what power does when it can’t catch its breath. It dimmed, not to nothing, but to the kind of half-light in which people see each other’s outlines and make a decision. The bulb’s song shifted, and the room learned a new key.

“Names,” I said, because you do not stop a thing once it has become the only honest word in the room. “All of them. Say them as if you bought them yourselves. Say them as if you intend to keep the receipt.”

They did. It was halting. It was messy. It was a chorus without a director. People have been taught not to be in charge of anything except their own demise. But the sound filled the lower spaces of the building first—the places where mold and regret and sensitive men live—and then it climbed. It found the rafters and hung there like laundry your grandmother does not want the neighbors to see. It flooded out the door and onto the street in a way the city’s regulations on volume do not have a unit for. The bell on the meter lost its mind, which was fine by me. It had been sane for too long.

The Aunts stopped because they did not know what to do next. They could arrest a person. They could arrest a room. They could not arrest a grammar. They stood at the lip of the stage in the posture of women who have been taught to step forward at the moment the man in front of them falls, ready to pick up the weight and call it duty. The man did not fall. He kept talking. That was me. I did not fall. I lowered my voice and the room leaned in like a river at a bend. I told them a joke about the Care Court’s summer hours and the way autumn pretends it can’t hear you. They laughed because they needed to practice something that wasn’t crying.

We do not get neat endings in this city. We get interruptions. When the back doors banged open the way only doors that have been bullied their whole lives do, the Widow’s Circuit came in with candles that should not have been permitted under any ordinance. They set the candles down on the stage and along the aisle and along the Aunts’ path, which was a subtle impudence. Fire teaches people things about themselves; the law frowns on unsolicited education. “Knockdown,” said Noema without looking at me, which was a word we had not negotiated beforehand and I did not need to. It meant, You will get one. Use it.

The Aunts withdrew a pace, which is not the same as retreating. A woman in the front row stood up and said, very clearly, “My name is Beatrice,” and the room let her. It accepted the name without haggling. Names are a currency more volatile than bread, but when someone spends one honestly the market calms. A man to my left said, “I am not a rumor,” and there was no laughter then, thank God, because you do not laugh when someone says that and means it.

It did not go on forever. The city would not permit it. A string of lights two streets over blew in sequence like a line of men losing their composure. The house across the way sent a signal to the street guardeds evidently older than my grandmother’s patience. The fact of a baton arrived at the mouth of the alley like punctuation. Seren took a step back and became negative space, which is the only way a woman like that survives with her mask unchipped. Noema caught my sleeve with two fingers and the touch said, It is time.

We got off the stage by forgetting it was a stage and remembering it was wood, which will forgive you many things if you have been kind to it. The door behind the curtain opened because it had learned what kind of person I was last night under a staircase. We moved like we were rehearsed, which we were not, and if you think I have ever loved anything as much as I loved the moment the crowd decided to be difficult on my behalf, then you have not been watching. They stood. They politely positioned themselves to become obstacles. They asked Aunts for their names, which is a social offense worse than spitting if you are wearing a uniform.

Backstage I found a corridor that had never been there when we were just a sad club with good acoustics. That is the thing about inside work: once you name a door, the building wants to please you. Noema went ahead with a light that looked like a decision. Seren appeared at my shoulder because she knows how to appear at shoulders; it is a marketable skill. The boy in my chest was present as pain somewhere between my sternum and my joke bag. We moved.

We did not run, because running lets a certain kind of authority believe it is giving chase. We walked with intent, which says to the corridors, Walk with us. One of the Widow’s Circuit—a man with a scar that read, in the right light, mercy—closed the door behind us and slipped a wedge beneath it the way you do when a little flood is on its way. The building took a breath as if it had been holding mine for me all night and now had to admit it.

“You overclocked it,” Seren said to Noema as we turned down a passage that had been storage and was now a theory. “I thought you’d keep the bell intact.”

Noema didn’t look up. “You thought wrong,” she said.

“Delicious,” Seren replied, with admiration that doubles as threat.

We came out in an alley that did not belong to the Lyric. The city does this when it thinks it can catch you in a lie; it rearranges itself slightly and watches to see whether your feet learn the new pattern. The sky had that strange late hour look where it has given up trying to be blue and is content to be told what color to be. A pair of drones pretended to be stars. The street guardeds were somewhere above us, auditing our weight.

“Left,” Noema said, which seemed arbitrary until a streetlamp flickered as if responding to a joke only she and God got. We had a few seconds of corridor that the city had forgotten to tax. We took them.

“Do not turn into a symbol without filing for permission,” Seren murmured, in a tone the city would read as affectionate. “It confuses the bureaucracy.”

“I’ll put in a form,” I said. “Three copies. Signed in milk.”

We did not get far before the street noticed the way rooms had been behaving and decided to prove it could behave worse. The lamps shifted back to State Blue with a mule’s stubbornness. A line of Aunts boiled up at the far end of the block in a rhythm I recognized: the cadence of women who have been trained to carry something heavy and pretend it is grace. We stopped because sometimes stopping is strategy and sometimes there is nowhere else to put your feet.

“Pretend to be a wall,” Noema said.

“That’s supposed to be easy for me,” I said, but the joke had the geniality of a man walking into a pole.

“Not a hole,” she snapped. “A wall.”

She put her palm flat on my chest. She pressed until the hand-shaped boy remembered to be quiet. I could feel the way a face would look in glass if the glass consented. Seren stepped forward with a card in her hand—not an ID, something more ancient. It had four lines on it. She held it up as the Aunts came into talking distance, and when she spoke her voice had the smell of a library about it, which is to say it promised good things to patient people.

“Civic Audit,” she announced. “Inventory in progress. No public adjustments permitted. Adjourned.”

The lead Aunt looked like a woman who once broke a mirror and decided it had deserved it. She scanned Seren’s card, found the absence of seal, and tried to be patient. The drones above us did the bug equivalent of a shrug. Noema, without changing her breathing, licked her thumb and touched the card’s bottom right corner. A small mark rose there like a bruise. The Aunt’s eyes tracked it the way prey animals track shadows. She did not like it. She respected it. She lowered her net a fraction.

“Who is he,” she asked, as if my presence might be an error in her paperwork.

“He is no one,” Seren said smoothly. “That is the point. He is a test of your obedience to procedure. Proceed.”

I have never desired to kiss a liar until that moment. It is a niche appetite. Seren held the Aunt’s gaze the way a cat holds the carpet when it means to scratch where it shouldn’t. The Aunt had choices. They were all bad. She made the one that let her keep authority with both hands. She stood back, wrote something on air with her finger—probably a complaint I will not get to read for a month—and let us pass, which is different from giving permission and different from being fooled. It is harm postponed. It is also a victory.

We threaded through a market that had decided to be closed but could not help displaying its goods because people need to see food whether they intend to buy it or not. Bread hunched in windows like unhappy gods. Fish watched us from ice with skeptical eyes. A boy who was and wasn’t there jumped rope with a shadow he had not been given. The city had the decency to smell like rain for five seconds. It was a mistake. It corrected.

At the Lyric, Sir Edward greeted me with an insult he had sharpened overnight for exactly this occasion: he yawned and then turned his back like a banker noticing my balance. Noema checked the windows with a glance that said she could see past the glass’s refusal. Seren put her card in her pocket and pretended not to feel its heat. We exhaled in shifts.

“That’s the last time we get away with that,” Noema said. “The room will remember it owes us nothing.”

“Rooms are like people,” Seren replied. “They owe everyone something. It is merely a question of how and when they pay. Tomorrow they pay in daylight.”

“You really think morning is a good time to mount a blasphemy,” I asked. “I prefer my heresies with night on.”

“It will not be a blasphemy,” Seren said. “It will be a compliance event. It will be so properly documented that the city will swallow it and discover only afterward that it was sharp.” She looked at me. There are women whose looks feel like signatures. Hers felt like a legal threat and a lullaby. “You wanted to kill a woman and end a law. I want to make a law notice it died. That takes paperwork. It takes witnesses.”

“What does it take from me,” I asked.

“Your voice, again,” Noema said. “Your insistence on being a person, again. Your refusal to let them set the terms of your presence, again. The easy things.”

“And the hard thing,” Seren added. “You will go to the Care Court and say your name before a bench that was built to make people into stories. You will refuse to be a cautionary tale. You will be a conclusion.”

“Those benches,” I said. I could see them even without the room. The wood blond as a sermon, the elevation so slight you don’t realize you’ve climbed until you fall. “They don’t like men talking.”

“That is precisely why you will,” Seren said. “They will hear you because their rules forbid it. Rules love to look in mirrors. We will teach them to admire the face they have been told does not exist.”

I felt the scarf heavy in my jacket, like a letter that has to be delivered to the wrong address on purpose. I put my hands around a cup I had not yet poured. The boy was awake and did not stretch. He knows now that I know where he sits. He is trying not to embarrass me with his loyalty. The cat decided to ignore all of us with fresh vigor.

“Tell me about him,” I said, because the rooms were quiet and I had chosen, for the moment, not to be careful. “You said you gave me a nothing. You said you cut a boy out of the paper and gave him to me as a consolation prize.”

Noema leaned against the mantel, making my ribbon of a photograph look dignified beside her elbow. “We were not going to make you alone,” she said. “We are cruel; we are not monsters. The ritual for erasing a person is older than any of the women who practice it. It has a part in it where you are offered a replacement. Most of the time it is not taken. It is meant to provide the eraser with a sense of ethics. I don’t believe in a sense of ethics. I believe in ethics. We took the part that was meant to salve the conscience and turned it into a machine. We were supposed to give you a talisman, something like a spin of thread or a piece of mirror. We gave you a companion instead.”

“A boy,” I said. “With my V on his knuckle.”

“With your stubbornness in his teeth,” she said. “With your habit of stepping where you aren’t meant to. He is not a ghost. He is not a demon. He is not an angel. He is the shape you make where the world told you to be flat.”

“And you, Seren?” I asked, turning. “What did you give me?”

“A stage,” she said. “And a sentence. That is the only fair trade I know.” She paused. “Also I once kept a prosecutor busy for four hours while you took a nap in a locker because a brave life is nothing without naps.”

“You remember everything,” I said.

“I remember what I can use,” she said. “It is a sickness. I am trying to make it medicinal.”

A silence arrived that did not require apologies. The street outside counted itself. The blue bulbs tried to settle on a story and failed. Sir Edward softened his spine by half an inch, which is how a cat signals commitment. It occurred to me with the kind of punctual clarity that calls itself epiphany and isn’t that I had not been hungry in six hours. The city noticed and sent me the smell of bread from somewhere I could not responsibly go. I stayed. I boiled water. I made tea that tasted like absence behaved.

Before dawn, the flyers went up the way they do: all at once, as if a particular sheet of the city’s skin had been instructed to grow ink. A woman in a wool cap on Vesper had one under her arm and showed it to everyone who would not look at it. It said, in the language of kind tyrannies: NOTICE OF CORRECTION. It had a drawing of a faceless person beneath it who was, by artistic convenience, shaped like me. The text said, UNSANCTIONED PRESENCE IDENTIFIED, then listed things like height, posture, rumor. It instructed good citizens not to speak to anyone answering to JAX QUINN on the grounds that such a person was a figment, and speaking to a figment is a kind of insanity. It gave a time for the Care Court’s demonstration of corrective procedure, and if you have ever spent a summer in this city you know that demonstration is a synonym for spectacle and corrective a synonym for pain you can clap at.

We ate bread that morning because we are not animals. The Widow’s Circuit sent men with baskets who were very bad at pretending to be vendors. Noema wore a dress that made her look like a seam in the city—essential, invisible, impossible to pull without everything coming apart. Seren wore her hair down for once, which meant she had decided not to hide the part of her that refuses to lie. I wore the jacket with the wrong number of pockets in it and the scarf in the lining and my name in my mouth like something that stains.

At the Court, the summer banners were up: garlands of flowers that had seen better seasons and slogans that had not. The benches had been adjusted to present their kinder side to the sun. A woman at the gate scanned people for laughter and excused them for the condition. Seren’s card did nothing here; it was not written in this dialect. Noema’s face did everything you would expect a face to do at a gate like that: it made guards see their own mothers and feel briefly ashamed of their posture. We went in because everyone else was and because the easiest way to smuggle a man into a room that doesn’t want him is to put him in a crowd of people who think the room is theirs.

The judge that day was the kind who looks like a grandmother until she speaks. She did the ritual in a friendly tone that promised snacks later. She read the charges against a woman who had named her dog after a forbidden month and a man who had built a chair without a permit. The audience nodded with the docility of citizens who have kept their heads out of ovens by admiring recipes. We waited for the moment where the script would widen enough for a body. It came, because scripts are designed by people who like order and therefore leave exactly enough room for disorder to think it is undercover.

“Any other business?” the judge asked, and you could hear the clerk’s pen lean toward the paper like a flower.

“Yes,” I said, and stood. It is a simple sentence. It tastes like salt. It sounds like a door forked on purpose.

The sound that followed was not a gasp. It was a disapproval badly hiding its excitement. People like it when something goes wrong in a room that has promised to keep everything right. The judge’s smile did the thing curtains do when a breeze informs them they are not the only fabric in the house. “Please be seated,” she said in the voice we use on animals who do not fetch.

“No,” I said, and the boy in my chest put his hand in mine without making a fuss. “I am here, and I am not on your docket, and I do not have a case number, and that is the point. I am a man with a name you will have to write down on paper that has never consented to me. I am a correction to your correction.”

It was very quiet, the way it is in a kitchen when you decide to end an argument with cutlery. Someone behind me whispered, Do not, and someone else whispered, do. Seren did not move. That is the only way I knew I was not yet dead. Noema laced her fingers in front of her stomach and looked at me the way the door had looked at my hand the first time: with resignation and hope.

“Security,” said the judge, which invited a kind of person with the wrong kind of armor to arrive. I did not let them. I took the scarf out of my jacket in one motion and it changed the color of the day. The red of it argued with the blue and because we had already taught the building how to be bored with blue, it entertained the red’s case. I did not drape it anywhere. I held it up like a question you insist on your mother answering in front of company.

“This is part of your machine,” I said to the room. “You made it to close throats. Watch it open them.”

I threw it like a lasso and it caught nothing because that is what we planned. It landed across the rail in front of the bench and lay there like a road. The woman with the dog named after a month made a sound that belongs to people who have watched a window open in a house they consider theirs. The man with the chair without a permit laughed out loud and then apologized to the law with his eyes, which is how they like it.

“You are not permitted—” the judge said, and then stopped because the scarf was humming and the microphones in the Court had been trained to follow hums that felt official. The speakers picked it up and fed it back to us, and for a moment everyone was listening to a sound that said, breathe.

“My name is Jax Quinn,” I said into the hum, and the room could not position the name anywhere safe. It hung. It fell. It tried to crawl into the minutes and found the clerk’s pen reluctant. Then, because people are mammals and mammals imitate, someone on the right said, “My name,” and someone on the left said, “My name,” and the judge did something I will tell my grandchildren about if I live long enough to invent them: she looked at me and looked at the scarf and looked at the law she had sworn to cradle and knew which of us was going to cry first if she insisted.

“You will be removed,” she said, and she meant it, and I believed her. A pair of Caretakers in uniforms the color of acupuncture moved toward me like competent weather. Noema shifted, and the man with the mercy-scar from last night—who had, this morning, disguised himself as a tinker with nothing in his cart but valid receipts—tripped in front of the first Caretaker in a way that could not by any evenhanded record be considered an accident. The second found his boot glued to the floor with a resin that had been a child's toy an hour ago and was now a policy. Seren was nowhere and everywhere, which means her work was being done.

I did not try to run. I did not try to be noble. I did not try to say everything at once because that is how people die in this city—talking too fast in rooms where the furniture wants to clap. I said my name again and then I said, into the microphone that had been installed to make empathy sound like compassion and compassion sound like a fine schedule, “You taught the glass to forget us. You told the rooms never to write us down. Use my name. Find a pen. There is a box in a house you love that is full of boys you did not count.”

The judge’s knuckles went white because that is the only color left to a woman whose blood will not be spilled in public. She gestured. The room decided to become a courtroom again. The Aunts decided to be efficient. That would have been the end of it, except that the building had learned a new word last night and it wanted to use it.

“Present,” it said, using the voices of everyone who had been in the club with me and everyone who had walked past the club and thought, Not tonight, and everyone who had laughed in the wrong place years ago and taught their throat to be careful. It said present. Not the judge. Not the clerk. The room. The walls. The microphones. The ridiculous blue bulbs that had been so confident in their sleep-inducing hum. The sound entered the paper in the clerk’s hand and made the pen draw a curve that could only be my Q.

The Caretakers took my arm because they are paid to follow instructions rather than phenomena. They were gentle because the room had just said something their grandmothers believed. Their gentleness made me angrier than force would have. The boy in my chest went very still, which is how children behave when they want to help you stop bleeding without knowing where to put their hands.

Seren stepped into a nonexistent space and said, “Adjourned,” and this time it was the kind of adjourned that carries an hour and a half of riot on its back. The Aunts responded by doing math faster than anyone else in the room could, and the math said, There are too many names here today to take home.

“Tomorrow at noon,” the judge said, and banged a gavel soft enough not to bruise. It was a stay. It was a promise. It was a trap. It was mercy disguised as mercy.

We left because they let us. That is the breed of victory we get. On the steps of the Court, women with careful hair and posture adjusted their bags and their opinions. Men with polite hands didn’t know what to do with them and put them in their pockets and took them out again. Someone said my name and then pretended they hadn’t. A girl asked her mother what a present was. Her mother said, a thing you get that you didn’t think you wanted, and then bit her lip like she had said something rude in church.

At the corner there was a kiosk where they sell legal bread at illegal prices, and the woman with the tired face handed me a loaf without looking directly at me, which is a skill. “Find a different job,” she said again, as if that were safety.

“I did,” I said, and she made a sound that was not quite approval, not quite sorrow. The drones above us did not descend. They recorded compilations of my absence for the archive. The blue bulbs took notes. The city developed a small headache it will deny later.

Back at the Lyric, Sir Edward had found the scarf and made a bed on it with feline arrogance. He lifted his head and found me looking and licked the hair on his shoulder as if to say, This is mine, which is very cat of him and very human of me to mind. I took the scarf back and he forgave me, which is a word that used to be the size of a kitchen and is now the size of a courthouse. The photograph of Elsin watched from the mantel like a witness you don’t call because it will waste the jury.

“You should know,” said Noema from the window, “that there is a price we didn’t bill you for.”

“There are so many,” I said, without complaint. “Surprise me.”

“Men will write your name on their palms tonight,” she said. “Some will wash it off before breakfast. Some will not. The ones who do not will discover what it means for a door to swing open when the laws think they are shut. The street will punish them in small ways. It will make their change incorrect. It will make their steps louder than the man beside them. It will ask them to prove their names to it a dozen times before noon. Some will stop saying it. Some will say it louder. We have begun a thing that will not discriminate in our favor.”

“Good,” I said, though it did not feel like good. It felt like tossing a stone into a pond and finding out the pond is a mouth. “What will Elsin do?”

“She will sit by a window in a room we are not permitted to enter and hum a song about a river that does not flow,” Seren said, surprising me by answering a question I did not exactly ask her. “She will argue with herself about the gains that justify losses. She will remember a deal she made with a devil that had a kind face. She will wonder if putting a rope in your hands and telling you to use it as a bridge counts as cruelty. She will decide it does and hope God is in the habit of reading errata.”

“And me?” I asked, because the day had put gratitude in me like a splinter and I wanted to find the exit wound.

“You will not sleep,” Noema said. “Then you will sleep all at once at an improper hour. You will dream of doors. You will wake to find the city has come to your door with a new kind of notice. You will need to decide whether to open it.”

We did not drink. The city is not safe drunk. We counted the places we had hidden microphones and found them intact. We checked the lines out the back and found none of them had been cut. We said the names we had collected that morning twice and then we stopped because there is such a thing as using a word up. When the room went quiet, the boy in me turned over. He pressed his wrist against mine. His skin felt like what a vow might feel like if you could hold it in your palm. He did not try to talk. Neither did I. We agreed to be complicated together for one more day.

The city does not wake; it rearranges its eyelids. The first message came before sun. It said, in the closeted typography of emergency: MANDATORY CLARIFICATION EVENT, NOON, CARE COURT, PUBLIC. The second said, noncompliance will be interpreted as consent. The third said, laughter is authorized, applause is not. That last one was because the meters had taught itself an extra bell overnight and the women in charge were not fond of machines learning new tricks without leaving a note on the counter.

I washed. The mirror washed nothing back at me. Sir Edward decided to permit my continued existence because his dish was full. Noema sat with a pad full of numbers that had the destiny of becoming a map and put it away when she saw me, which is how I know the map was for me and not a place. Seren had her pen between her teeth and spit it out when she smiled around it, which means she was fond of me against her better judgement. The scarf lay folded. I did not pick it up. I knew it would do what it wanted regardless.

We walked toward the Court into a city pretending to be fine. People walked quickly because they had been taught that dawdling was a form of protest and protests get funny in the afternoon. A boy chalked hopscotch on a sidewalk in numbers none of us recognize anymore. A man with an official apron arranged peaches in a row that did not exist last year because last year peaches were a sin. The blue bulbs hummed in harmony with each other, which is a worrying sign. The drones flew a pattern that says, We are small and harmless, please disregard the wet red undercarriage.

On the steps of the Court, a woman I did not recognize and did not want to recognized me the way you recognize zippers on someone else’s clothing: as a practical fact. She slid in next to us. She did not speak. Noema adjusted to accommodate her the way one building adjusts to another if they intend to share a wall. Seren nodded to the air above her head as if greeting a witness perched on the eaves. When the judge came in and banged a gavel that had been sanded smooth by the years, we stood because it is a reflex. Reflexes are what get you through days when intentions would be a hazard.

“We will have clarity,” said the judge, and I will give her this: she sounded like she wanted it. “We will proceed in order. We will contain and conclude. We will reopen. We will go home.”

She looked at me because there was nothing else to look at. You know the way certain kinds of attention get in your clothes and make you itch? Her gaze was the opposite. It emptied my pockets without touching them. It checked behind my ears for lint. It weighed me for travel. It did not bother with my face because the room had still not agreed to write it down.

“State your name,” she said, and it was the loveliest wrong order anyone had given me in my life.

“I will,” I said. “But first you will write it.”

The clerk looked at the paper like it had just flirted with him in the wrong bar. He poised his pen on air. The room breathed. Outside on the square someone dropped a glass and it did not shatter because the city wanted that sound later. Seren had her pen out but was not writing. Noema had her hands laced and was pressing hard enough that the skin across her knuckles thought about mutiny. The scarf lay coiled in my pocket like a good story waiting to be told wrong.

I said my name. The judge did not flinch. The clerk wrote something that could be a letter. The room did the new thing again without being asked. It said present in the particular tone a person uses at roll call when their name has been mispronounced for years and they are too tired to remind the teacher but too stubborn to raise their hand without saying something accurate.

The judge nodded. It was a motion so small it would not have registered if I had been the only one to see it. We were not alone. The benches were full of people who had laughed in the night and discovered they wanted to clap in the day. The Caretakers had positioned themselves in neat pairs like nouns and verbs. The Aunts were in the corners with their nets folded like linen napkins. The blue bulbs were bright enough to sanitize.

“Very well,” she said. “Mr. Quinn. You are here.”

It felt like a trick and it was. It also felt like god. The boy in my chest did not clap. He pressed his hand on the inside of my ribs as if to say, stand up straight. I did. I have never been so tall. I have never been so short. I looked at the paper in the clerk’s hand and saw the curve of my Q bloom like mold. The city will call it a mistake later. It will call it a glitch. It will call it an isolated phenomenon. It will call it a well-intentioned error. It will call it an act of care. It will call it anything but a hinge.

“Proceed,” the judge said, and somewhere deep in the machinery of law a pin slid home into a place it had forgotten existed, and something old and sharp and female and communal gave way with a sigh.Proceed, she said, and the word poured into the wood with the specificity of a nail. The room arranged its spine as if to receive a weight it had anticipated and hated, and I felt the way a stage shifts underfoot when a violinist tunes: small, merciless adjustments toward a pitch the instrument believes in more than the player. The clerk raised his pen with the fragile bravery of a man about to marry ink to an idea, and the Aunts in their corners softened their knees the way you do when you are trained to be a human hinge. It smelled like paper and starch and a kind of milk that had traveled too far to still be kind. I said nothing yet. There is a difference between being permitted to speak and speaking; I have lived entire seasons in that difference.

The judge leaned back, which in this court was the same as leaning forward. “We will begin by establishing intent,” she said, turning the syllables like keys. “We seek clarity. You seek—what, Mr. Quinn?” Her voice took my name with the care you reserve for fragile contraband, not fragile men. The microphones found her mouth the way loyal dogs do and brought it back to us powdered and official. A man beside me coughed the cough people cough when their lungs have learned to apologize before they expand. I could feel Noema at my left like a stitch keeping me inside my own seams, and I could feel Seren at my right like a law that had waited too long to be passed and now expected complication as payment.

“I came to be written,” I said, choosing verbs like rope. “I came to make your paper have to remember my edges. I came to make a room say present and mean me.” The red scarf warmed in my pocket as if it liked the word. You should know that liking a word in this city is an activity with consequences; words have more addresses here than people do. A murmur went up and sat back down like an old drunk recognizing a song halfway through its first line. The judge did not move except to let her eyelids consider the air.

“And you expect the Court to—what?” she said, and the cunning lay under the conversational tone like a wire under a rug. “To validate a trespass? To sanction improper presence?” She almost smiled. “To certify laughter?” The word hung there like contraband laundry and every blue bulb in the ceiling dimmed by a fraction before deciding to recover its poise.

“I expect you to do your job,” I said, which is a sentence that never makes me popular and never makes me wrong. “I expect you to record. I expect you to resist the appetite to be god and settle for being a ledger. If you must be compassionate,” and here I felt the boys in the back row flinch the way chickens do when a shadow inaccurately fox-shaped crosses the yard, “then be accurate about it. I’m not here to be saved. I’m here to be counted.”

Seren moved her weight from one foot to the other, which means she was proud in a way she will not admit even if you bribe her with the only currency she respects, which is a change in precedent. “Motion for standing,” she said without standing. “Petition for recognition of personhood in order to facilitate correction consistent with the City’s own care schema.” There are people who make words into a weapon; Seren makes them into a room, and then makes a woman like the judge feel rudely dressed if she refuses to step inside. The clerk looked at her as if a legal doctrine had just flirted with him in daylight, then looked at his pen and made a small mark that would have been illegal thirty seconds ago.

The judge folded her hands in front of her as if to demonstrate that they were empty, which is how you know a performance is good; it reminds you of your own hands. “On what authority,” she asked Seren lightly, “do you ask us to manufacture a status for a category of citizen your side of this argument insists does not exist?” She kept her eyes on me the way a falcon does when someone else tries to pick up its prey. “Why should we entertain a contradiction when the city runs on the fuel of consistency?”

“Because you wrote the contradiction into law,” Seren said, and the kindness in her mouth made it twice as rude. “Because the Cradling Edict asserts a care jurisdiction over erasures. Because custody requires acknowledgment. Because you cannot exercise mercy on that which you will not admit you can touch. Because if you deny him standing you imply you have no power to punish or protect him, and you hate implying that more than you hate being wrong.” The judge glanced at her clerk, who looked as if he had just realized the spoon in his hand had a blade at the other end.

Noema’s voice was not crafted for courts; it is the kind of voice that patrols air like a guard dog and lets you know whether it will let you pass. “Because there are two hundred witnesses here who can testify that he is a body in a room, and that is a spectacular burden on any doctrine of invisibility. Because if we walk out and say the Court refused to record a man in front of it, you will start a fire so pretty people will light candles at the wrong time to watch it carry.” She turned her head and looked the judge full in the face in a public room, which used to count as a felony in the age of my grandmother’s prime. The judge did not send a net. She let her own eyes absorb the collision.

“Standing granted for the purpose of clarification,” the judge said, and it cost her exactly what a bowl of milk costs a cat: something she will pretend she did not want to keep for herself once she sees it empty. The clerk wrote a word that was not recognize and not admit and not accept; he wrote present, because the room had taught him the spelling. He did it in a hand that had copied laws for decades and it trembled exactly once. “Proceed.”

I told them a story in full daylight, which is a thief’s trick. You walk out with a sack labeled truth and people permit you to keep it because it looks heavy and dull, and they are wrong and late. I told them about the House of Milk that taught me to fold myself into polite sizes and the wound on my hand that used to look like a V and now looks like a vowel I refused to pronounce. I told them about the mirrors and the night you first understand that you are absence to the glass and that it is your job to be grateful for how easy it will be to sneak into rooms where you are not meant to go. I told them about the box under the stairs, which is not a detail the Circuit wanted me to include, and I told them about the kitchen with the red scarf that is not a murder and not a mercy but a door. I did not say Elsin’s name; I could feel it lodged between my teeth like a pin you suck because you have no other safe place for it and you need both hands for the work. I kept my mouth full of mine.

They listened because they were not permitted to clap and because the meters in the corners had been taught that breath is a kind of laugh if you count it at the right tempo. The bell we had smuggled into their diet of metrics did its small factory work, registering exhalations as a civic good. A woman near the aisle covered her throat while I spoke of scarf and law and color, then removed her hand when she realized she had been imitating a pose she had been taught to find compassionate. An Aunt wrote my words down on a pad she was not authorized to carry, and when she caught herself doing it she dropped the pencil like a confession and then picked it back up as if nothing had happened. The judge watched me with the attentiveness of a woman who knows some part of her day will be footnoted against her will and is auditioning her own future remorse.

“The mirrors were not cruel,” I said, and even the lights leaned at that. “They were obedient. We made cruelty out of obedience and put a uniform on it. We called the result care. I am not here to make you weep for me. I am here to ask how long you are going to let furniture decide what a person is.” Laughter arrived in its embarrassing clothes and tried to clean up its appearance as it stood; it failed, gloriously, which meant it was honest. A Caretaker blushed for no reason the city had approved. Noema’s hand found my sleeve and did not correct my trajectory. Seren let me spend the outrage I had been saving for evenings at an hour when it would cost more.

The judge made a show of consulting a code that might as well have been a hymnal. “The Court cannot litigate architecture,” she said, which is how authority often denies medicine to a wound it doesn’t like the look of. “We interpret. We apply. We do not build.” She looked down at the clerk’s fresh ink as if it had surprised her by being wet. “However, the City did indeed insist on jurisdiction. It is therefore confused by your insistence that we put our hands behind our backs before touching you.”

“Then touch,” I said, and held both my hands up, palms open not to be pretty about it but because I wanted the room to see the small scar on the knuckle, the one that does not photograph and does not reflect and does not answer to surveillance. “Touch and say into your record what texture you find. See whether the paper refuses to let you write it down.” The first Aunt took a single pace forward and learned from her muscles that she had been trained not to reach for men in public unless it was to restrain them, and the second Aunt read that lesson off the first and made it her own. The judge’s fingers twitched, more than the hands of someone who keeps them from twitching would in a year.

Seren offered a form that had been out of circulation since the invention of better ephemera. “Writ of Witness,” she said, as if we had just discovered the proper spoon in a drawer full of ghosts. “It predates the Care. It predates the Grand Council. It predates the part of the city that thinks it can legislate where a person begins.” The judge’s mouth did something ugly for half a second and then did something generous: it remembered there is a pleasure in being forced to reach back before your own glamour to find a reason to be proud. “Granted,” she said, and the room tasted the old law like a spice you inherited but don’t use because none of your current recipes deserve it.

There was no oath and there was no bible of approved imagery to place a palm on. That was its beauty. I put my hand on the rail and the clerk wrote a curve and the scar on my knuckle did not answer to him and that failure entered the record as a kind of success. I told them, under old law that had never imagined a city like this one, that I was a person who had been taught to be light and was now teaching a room to know the weight of me. I told them I intended nothing tidy and everything that could be borne by sentences. I told them I was willing to be punished if that punishment will be recorded in a hand that no longer refuses to draw my Q.

It was around then that the door at the back acknowledged a color the room did not control. You know that shade: the careful joyless crimson of appointments that cannot be declined. A veil walked in with a woman underneath it and you could tell by the way the Aunts’ knees changed that someone with an old name had decided to be new in person. The veiled woman did not sit. She occupied her air the way an institution does when it has rented the weather for the afternoon. The judge’s eyes did not go to her because only amateurs show their fear by looking at it. She said, “Proceed,” with the elaborate ennui of someone who knows they are about to be interrupted.

The interruption identified itself without lowering its veil. “Recall writ,” said the voice that could order a river to behave across a decade. “On behalf of the Matron-Root. The city holds in trust one exemplar for whom the demurrers of erasure have been suspended and must be applied. Jurisdiction requests return to origin.” You could taste Elsin Reed in that without her name on the paper; it was in the rhythm, the way a woman can still bite her consonants like the edge of a spoon after years of having younger mouths taste for her.

Seren did not bow because she does not bend for theater and because her spine has learned it is a beam in rooms like this. “Object,” she said, as if we were discussing a new hire. “Standing has been established. Witness writ has been granted. The Root may request a relic; it may not call a person an item and expect a Court that claims to be fond of history to let that go unremarked.” Her tone had the softness of wool over wire. “Besides, he cannot be recalled to a cradle you taught to miscount.”

The veiled woman stepped far enough into light that the blue tried to eat her and failed politely. She spoke as if she had asked this room to marry her once and been declined and had never forgiven it for the slight. “The Matron-Root has asked,” she said, which is the kindly past tense of command. “We would prefer not to force a lesson where courtesy would suffice.”

You learn people by what they think courtesy is. The judge glanced at the clerk’s page as if to ask it what moment it preferred to be memorialized into, then back at the veil. “The Root may have him at sundown,” she said, and the calculation was as crisp as a new apron; it told me everything about her vision of her day. “We will take clarity while we have daylight.” The veil inclined. It was the bow furniture makes when a certain kind of woman enters a room; it is not a bow of respect. It is a bow of habit.

Noema’s hand tightened on my sleeve the way a seam does when you put weight on it at last, and I felt the boy in my chest go still in that way which means he is counting exits. We were on a clock, which is not news, but the clock had a face now and it wore a grandmother’s mouth. Seren’s pen clicked gently between her fingers and it sounded like a metronome set to someone else’s heart; it calmed me and frightened me and made me think of old smiles. I raised the scarf as far as I could without making a ritual where there should be none, and waited for the next hinge to admit it was wood.

We learned long ago in the House of Milk that if you cannot stop a rule, you should at least choose the moment when it lands on your neck. “Then take clarity,” I said, which was both a dare and a promise. “Don’t take it from me. Take it from the room you built.” I untied the scarf because ties are for people with time and I laid it across the rail in front of the bench and pulled it taut so that it ran like a bridge between the elevated and the named. It hummed in a frequency the microphones loved because they were designed to love the voice of power; I did not feel bad about that theft. The judge could have ordered an Aunt to remove it. She did not. Perhaps she wanted to see what kind of door it could be before she locked it.

“Name,” I said, not mine, and turned away from the bench toward the benches, which is a rudeness I learned from Noema, and met the eyes of a woman whose mouth was set to habitual apology. “If you dare.” She didn’t. She couldn’t. The man beside her did. His voice was ugly in the way honest voices are when they realize they are still capable of a crime worth doing; he said a boy’s name and found himself still standing afterward. It went through the scarf and came back larger without changing tone, like a river that had been given a bend to play with.

The veil did not move and yet the room made room for a small chill. The Aunts shifted their weight back to their heels and the Caretakers practiced being furniture again. The judge did that thing with her hands again where she made a shelter on the table and then pretended to be under it. The clerk wrote the name he heard without looking to the judge for permission, which is more progress than most of our marriages have achieved. Seren watched the ink dry with a lover’s hunger. Noema looked at the scarf as if it were a road she had built without a permit.

There is a limit to the number of names a day can carry, and there is a talent to stopping just before you force mercy into spectacle. I am learning both, and if that sounds like humility, it is not; it is survival. I spoke three more and then stopped, not because the room asked, not because the judge banged anything, not because the veil breathed, but because the boy pressed hard inside my chest and the thing about a companion that lives under your ribs is that he knows the edge where your courage becomes performance. I let the quiet arrive. It made itself at home. It put its elbows on the table and started giving us advice.

“We have heard,” the judge said, and her voice had lost some treacle. “We have recorded. The Court will now determine what is to be done with an anomaly that refuses to cooperate with either erasure or incarceration.” She looked at me as if she were naming a room in a house she can’t afford and resenting both facts. “We will decide whether we will let you be a person here, Mr. Quinn, or whether we will take the Root’s offer and return you to the place where your outlying geometry began.”

“The geometry did not begin in a cradle,” I said, because if you say the name of a thing in this room you owe it an honest map. “It began the first time a woman was told to count only what could be safely made into a law. We are not going to fix that arithmetic with a roomful of mouths, but we can call it by its wrong name until the name gets tired of answering and changes.”

The judge’s smile happened and then vanished in the space of a breath, which is the closest a woman like that gets to making a sound nobody paid for. “I am going to take a recess,” she said, and stood in the way that says, If you move, I will punish moving. “When I return,” and that if hung brighter than the bulbs, “I will issue a determination.” The veil inclined again as if to say, Darling, we are all pretending we have choices to keep morale up. The Aunts made a corridor with their nets folded and the Caretakers pretended to discover that their spines were made of two parts, and I found Noema’s eyes and knew we had as much time as the city’s attention span, which is to say not enough to change clothes.

We stood in the noise that people make when they are being courteous to their fear, and I watched the way attention moved. It slid past me of course, because it had been trained, but it got caught now on the edges of me like a skirt on a nail; it could not quite pretend I was a shadow furniture had spilled. Seren murmured something to a woman who had flowers in her hair in a way that suggested she did not put them there for pleasure. Noema’s fingers tapped a pattern on her own arm I recognized as a fuse count. The veil settled, yes, settled, like a bowl settling into a table it expects to own for the evening. I did not look toward the back doors. I had no appetite for heroism in an alley and I had spent my heroism for the morning on a curve of ink.

It turned on the smallest thing. A child dropped a wooden toy—the kind carved by someone’s grandfather who is embarrassed to be creating contraband joy in a city that prefers plastic—and the sound of it landing was enough like a gavel that half the room flinched and the other half sighed and the veil turned its head with the offended patience of an animal that has decided not to kill you today only because it has an appointment. The boy under my ribs laughed. It was a small impropriety, and it saved me from doing something stupid with my hands.

Outside, a noise arrived like weather. We forget in our proud little rooms that the city has lungs. It had been holding its breath for us. Now it exhaled. You could hear it in the friction between shoes and stone, in the way paper behaves when a hundred people hold it with hands that want to do something more purposeful. The Widow’s Circuit had been busy—Noema is not the sort of person who comes to court without bringing her own staircase. Candles were not permitted but matches exist and so do bright mirrors hung in alleys at angles that direct sun into the eyes of cameras like small acts of charity. The crowd was the wrong size for an evacuation and the right one for an afternoon in which you don’t get to go back to your day.

“We are leaving before they call us,” Noema said, and you do not argue with a woman who has a plan for light’s habits. “We need the judge to announce her determination into an empty chair. She will sound like divinity and feel like a ledger and the two will confuse each other until sundown.” She had her hand on my arm in that way she has where the hand is both weight and map. Seren gave the scarf a look and then returned it to me, a neatness I appreciated; if you find yourself on a scaffold, take comfort in paperwork that has been handled properly.

The Aunts did not stop us because stopping us would have meant making a decision in front of their boss’s veil and no one is paid enough to take that initiative. The Caretakers checked the rails for scratches the way you do when company is in the house and you intend to live with your furniture afterward. The judge did not look up; she was reading old law not with her eyes but with the part of her that has a taste for sentences that can be said without a microphone. We went out under an arch that had been designed to make you feel important enough to cooperate and I resolved to enjoy the feeling and decline the rest.

The square flexed the way squares do when they have spent all morning being a place and now intend to be an animal. People who had no business being brave were being very brave indeed in the modest domestic ways this city allows: they stood where the line wanted them to move; they spoke to someone they ordinarily avoid; they held paper with both hands. If you think that is nothing, you have not watched a hundred days pass here. The blue bulbs hummed like bees with a rumor. The drones had that anxious listlessness of machines discovering they have two contradictory directives and do not have a mother to ask which one to obey.

There was a movement like a tide meeting a hull when the crowd realized I was an object it had been told not to look at and then realized in the same breath that it intended to do so anyway. They looked in that embarrassed, hungry way you look at the thing a story forgot to account for. I held my name in my mouth like you hold a coin with your tongue to test whether it is heat-conductive; it was, and the burn was lovely. Seren touched the back of my shoulder with two fingers and arranged my posture like a sentence. Noema let the pressure of her hand tell me which direction to become.

A girl in a coat that had been made by two different people at two different times held up a scrap of mirror and pointed it at me. It was a child’s science; she wanted to see whether light would bounce off a man who had been taught to be matte. The shard caught my chest and hesitated, then did, in fact, reflect. Not cleanly, not with fidelity, but enough. The girl laughed that sudden involuntary laughter that belongs to animals and babies and men who have made it through a night and found bread in the morning, and her mother put a hand on her shoulder because you cannot look too happy here without someone thinking you have a secret supply of something.

The Aunts boiled into the square at the edge like practical weather, their nets folded and their eyes professionally serene. They had orders that had not yet forgone their manners. One of them, face like a landscape that has been smoothed for farming, called out that we were to disperse; she used a verb that suggests dandelions and children’s curls rather than riot; you can always tell which ones were trained in the season when the city pretended it wanted to be a nursery. Seren’s card did not work in sunlight and she knew it. She used a louder thing.

“Adjourned,” she said into the square, and the word went through the scarf in my pocket and came out dressed in a red it had not expected. The crowd scattered in the precise way you do when you intend to be harder to gather next time. It did not flee. It rearranged. The Aunts stood there and measured types, and the measures did not match what they had been given in training, and the small despair you saw on one face when she realized that everything gets heavier when it is named was the sort that makes a city worse or better depending on what she does when she goes home to her kitchen and looks at the spoon she took from her grandmother’s drawer.

We made it to the Lyric because the street had been taught to be sentimental about local institutions and because I did not look behind us. Sir Edward greeted us with the elaborate scorn of a banker deeply relieved to see you alive enough to owe. Noema went to the window. Seren took off her shoes, not because she had to, but because you only polish weapons you intend to hide. The scarf lay quiet on the chair and behaved like an obedient thing. The house above us, the city that does not sleep, breathed in and out in a rhythm we had taught to miscount.

No messenger knocks in this town. Paper arrives the way thunder does: it chooses a patient roof. The letter slid under the door with a neatness that insulted the day, the real paper sort, not the cybernetic courtesy of the sanctioned transmissions. The envelope knew my name even if the municipal ledger had not fully consented to admit me. The hand that wrote it did not pretend to youth. The seal was thread, not wax, a braid I had seen once around a throat I had been invited to close. I did not need to open it to know who had written. I opened it because you do not leave wolves outside if you are going to sleep in the house.

Child, it said, which is either tenderness or a legal category depending on what follows. I choose not to choose. There was no apology, and if you think you need one to be moved, you have not read enough documents written by women who invented things. She did not waste nouns telling me what she had done. She used verbs to give me a to-do list: come at dusk alone; bring the scarf because it recognizes doors; do not bring your friends because I will not harm you if I can avoid it and I do not have enough carefulness left for more than one body. She wrote me an address I could have located in my sleep because it was the place where sleep learns to be a citizen: the annex behind the Hall of Cradles, where the boxes breathe when they think we are not listening.

Seren read over my shoulder not because she is rude but because she has made a hobby of learning things she is not invited to. “Of course she calls you child,” she said after the merciful pause that is the best a friend can do when a letter arrives that will punch for a while before you can bleed. “She can only think in categories those fingers taught her to cut. You will go anyway. It is good theater. Also it is her only honest room.”

Noema did not argue, which is how you know we had moved past the season in our acquaintance when she believes I will consent to plans that do not include my complications. “You will go,” she said, “and you will walk out, or you will not. Either way the day will do its math. Before you leave you will let me sew this into your jacket.” She held up a strip of wire that looked like a mistake; in her hands everything looks like a plan. “If you are not out by midnight I will short the bulbs on that block and the drones will get bored and the mothers will forget to hum.”

I wrote a note to a future where I did not return and left it under the cat’s dish because he is the only creature in my rooms with both loyalty and keys. Seren rolled her shoulders as if trying to loosen the day out of them and failed handsomely. “She will want you to stand in front of the mirror,” she said. “She will want you to watch yourself not appear. She will ask you who owns that trick. Say, I do, and then turn away so she has to look at the place where your face should be. Do not let her force you to be the person she can forgive. Be the person she cannot calculate.”

Dusk here is a negotiation, not a phase. It arrived in increments like an apology delivered by a woman who refuses to cry in your doorway. The city put on its coat of blue and decided it was elegant. I fastened the jacket Noema had altered to include wire that could confuse a drone into thinking it was hungry and a pocket that could disguise the scandal of my pulse. The scarf folded into itself as if tiring of being admired. I told Sir Edward nothing because he would rather not know, and if you think cats cannot love in ignorance you have not asked them to keep a secret.

The annex behind the Hall of Cradles has no official door. Everything there is invited. Servants use it and laws get their hems dirty there and women with power come at hours that wash off easier than others. The city had the decency to put a tree nearby that still miscounted its leaves, as if to reassure us that not everything had become an accountant. I went in through a correction in a wall that had learned discretion, and the air tasted like things you are taught to call sterile because you do not have the language to call them lonely.

She was waiting where furniture learns to accept fate: a table with paperwork on it, a chair too straight for a human spine, a lamp designed to intimidate shadows into confessing. Elsin did not wear a veil. She has always been brave in that particular way that lets cowardice get a whole new wardrobe. The red scarf was folded on the table as one might fold a treaty. She did not gesture for me to sit. She did not look pleased. She looked accurate.

“You came,” she said, and if I were a better man, a younger man, a man with a kinder childhood, I would have said I was glad to be there to answer my grandmother’s voice. I am none of those things. I said, “Of course,” and it sounded like the sound a hinge makes when it admits it has been overused.

“You have made me something I did not intend to be,” she said in the tone of a woman giving directions to a room that is used to turning into a hallway when she tells it to. “A symbol. I hate symbols. They are lazy.” She touched the scarf with one finger and then put that finger on her own thumb as if to punish it for wanting. “I asked you here for two reasons. One is sentimental. The other is arithmetic.”

“Start with the math,” I said, because if I let her lead with sentiment we would spend an hour in the parlor where women are allowed to cry as long as they are polite about it and I do not do well in rooms where tears have a dress code.

“The city is misbehaving,” she said without flattery to either of us. “You have discovered a method for making it write what it does not want to. The mirror miscounts. The paper hesitates. The rooms have learned a word older than the department in charge of them. If you continue, we will be forced to break something to correct something. I do not yet know whether the thing we will break is a man or a law. I am too old to pretend I do not prefer the law, but I am older than that, and I have a habit of choosing men when the room is watching.”

“And the sentiment,” I asked, because it would be rude to leave that out in the night and because there is a sick curiosity to see where women put the soft things they never show you until you have done something unforgivable.

“You belong to me,” she said in a voice that had learned to say belongs only to nouns that had consented. “And I gave you away. That is a math problem, but it is also—what do the girls call it now?—a feeling. I would like to look at you while I still have some control over how the light behaves. I would like to ask you to forgive me and to refuse so I can die doing the right amount of penance. I would like to tell you a story that will make you think I was poor in choices. I would like you to believe it so I can sleep tonight. That is the sentimental part.” She smiled in that way people do when they want to confess to thinking about being kinder than they were and wish to be punished for only thinking.

I stood and did not sit because sitting would have put my knees in a posture my childhood recognizes as obedient. I took the scarf and did not put it around my neck or hers because the room would have chosen for me and I am done taking that risk in cabinets where the air smells like policy. “You cannot repair me with remorse,” I said. “Any more than I can repair you with my death. The city wants a spectacle. Seren wants a precedent. Noema wants what the world owes the clever and the stubborn: infrastructure. I want men to see their faces in glass on mornings when no one is watching them and not wonder whether they borrowed a head. If you want to give me anything, give me a story I can tell that does not make me a hero and you a monster. I am tired of the two-room house where those people share a wall.”

She nodded as if I had fetched the right spoon after all. “You are too much like me,” she said, and the kindness in it made something ugly in me try to live through the moment without clawing. “I will give you the arithmetic first, since you are my grandson in more than name. The doctrine of recall writ is older than even my mentors remember being. It was meant to fetch a person from a room where they were in danger of becoming something impractical like a martyr and return them to the place where women understand what happens to the world when a man refuses to be furniture. I can rescind it. I can say before those veiled fools that the arithmetic does not balance. The problem is that if I do, I admit that my math broke not in the margins but at the hinge. It will reduce my text. I do not care about my text. I care about the habit it will teach my daughters: to change a rule because it is inconvenient.”

“You made a rule because I was inconvenient,” I said, because sometimes the only kindness to a person who built a house on a swamp is to show them their foundation with a stick. “You taught glass not to see me because it made your other tasks easier. You counted shortages and surplus and found my face to be a deficit you could convert into a surplus of safety. You howled it into law. The city harmonized. You are not the only author, but you are the first person I can hand a pen to who will write in a different tense. Make a mess. Teach your daughters that mercy breaks order and you survive it.”

“The sentiment?” She asked it dry, which was the correct way to keep us from spilling into a posture neither of us is equipped to maintain with dignity. “You will not forgive me, and I will not ask. Good. Here is what I will admit to craving: to die in a way that does something more ambitious than impress the women who hated me prettily. If you continue this work, I will be included in its mathematics. My name will fall with the doctrine, and that is as close as I will get to being useful in the aftermath. I am vain enough to want it. I am old enough to say that out loud.”

“You do not have to die for my work to live,” I said, because I am a comedian and therefore I am always at risk of forgetting that punchlines and exits are not the only ways to end a sentence. “You may have to live with its mess. That is uglier. I recommend it.” The lamp found a scratch on the table and decided to make it into a personality. Elsin’s hand hovered over the scarf and then found her lap. Brave women can still be tasteful. “What do you want me to do tonight?”

“Walk out,” she said. “Refuse recall. Force me to rescind it and make me write the words myself in front of the veils. Give me the gift of being humiliated in a way that teaches. Let a thousand small women who have learned my posture watch me bend in public.” She smiled again, this time with a self-satisfaction so pure I almost loved her for it. “And then do not come back here. You cannot. If you do I will keep you because I am weak and you will die in a room I designed to let you starve prettily.”

We sat in it, the future. It hummed like a bulb. It had a taste like wire. The boy in my chest moved closer to my spine and made my posture better. I understood then that he wanted me to leave before that human desire to see what happens next imprisoned us in the annex by its own curiosity. “I will say your name,” I told her, because it is not cruelty to warn a person of the weather. “Not here. Not there. But in a room where the paper can count without being taxed. I will say it the way you do arithmetic: with wrists.” Her eyes sharpened in the way a woman’s do when unexpected flattery arrives disguised as a threat and she realizes she can have it both ways if she is clever.

She stood and for a moment she looked not like a matron or a root but like a woman who had never expected the city to choose her and invented a method for being chosen that required only that she never fall in love with anything she couldn’t count. “Take the door I used,” she said. “Do not touch the walls on the way out. They like to remember how men feel.” I went the way she told me and the annex unrolled itself under my feet like a tongue. Behind me the lamp went calm. Ahead of me the city sharpened its blues because it hates to be shown how much red it contains.

Noema was waiting in the shadow of the museum with that particular stillness that comes from attending a dozen disasters elsewhere while standing in one place. She touched my sleeve and shook her head, which is her way of saying, don’t tell me yet or I will improve your choices beyond repair. Seren leaned out from a darkness on my right and offered me a cigarette she did not expect me to take because she knows I do not smoke; she likes gestures more than objects. “Tomorrow,” she said, and her smile was an amateur’s delight at a professional job: raw, ecstatic, late. “She will rescind. The veils will ache. The judge will play patron saint of accuracy. The street will learn a tune. You will be tired like a saint and meaner than usual. This is the part where you sleep.”

In my rooms, Sir Edward had moved the scarf to the back of the chair and shed on it with an equanimity that honors nothing and proves everything. I set it on the mantel again like a flag in a foyer. The mirror in the bathroom tried one more time to recall me and achieved, I swear to you, a faint outline like a pencil rubbing of a coin; I did not reward it with my attention because I have learned not to spoil institutions for walking. The laughmeter on the wall, our sacrilegious saint, clicked twice in the quiet as if confirming the presence of breath, and I lay down with my jacket on because the wire in it felt like another layer of skin I had not been given at birth and was not about to abandon at the end of a day that had done so much arithmetic without me.Chapter 10 began with the city refusing to admit it had slept. Morning did not pour so much as lean in, checking the room’s posture like a mother who will not say she is proud even when she is, because compliments make children sloppy. I woke in the jacket like a man who had married his tools and was trying to figure out whether divorce was in bad taste. The wire sewed into the lining lay against my ribs with the calm of a coin that will not be spent today; the scarf had climbed the back of the chair overnight the way cats do, which meant Sir Edward had supervised and pronounced it tolerable. The laughmeter on the wall put its slim needle at attention as if to say, I am ready to tell you whether you belong here, and for once I resisted the urge to tell it a joke to confuse its theology.

The dream had been a cliché good enough to survive itself: fifty doors again, but this time they argued quietly about who would pretend not to be wood. I stood at the one with the grain like a weather map and put my hand flat to listen. It told me, without words, to stop rehearsing my exit and practice returning instead. I woke with that instruction pinned to my palate like a wafer and decided not to spit it out. There is nothing a city hates more than a man who decides to be consistent on purpose; it confuses the bureaucrats and disappoints the romantics.

Noema came before the kettle confessed it was water. She moves in the mornings as if time owes her interest, and perhaps it does. She looked at me the way you look at a bridge you have to cross with a crowd and can’t afford to admire yet. “You didn’t take off the jacket,” she said, and touched the place where the wire lay with two fingers like a blessing.

“I thought I might need ribs,” I said. “I thought the city might make an argument out of my chest.”

She put a small roll on the table that pretended to be bread. The Widow’s Circuit has an arrangement with the honest bakers that keeps a certain kind of hunger at a politeness level. “Eat, and decide what you will not do,” she said. “The day will take care of deciding what you will.”

Seren arrived with the sort of smile that collects secrets without making you spend them. She wore a blouse the color of patience and sleeves that could strangle a doctrine if she felt theatrical. In her hand was the sort of pen men used to propose with when proposals still had ink. She held it up like a relic and then pocketed it because the only way to keep anything holy here is to stop showing it to the room. “She will rescind,” she said, without saying Elsin’s name and then without looking at me to punish me for thinking she had. “She will do it to be accurate and to humiliate herself correctly and to teach and to be admired by people who know how to admire properly. She will do it in a way that ensures she is remembered correctly by people who write the text. We will be there to make sure the text finds the wrong adjectives charming.”

“What will the judge do,” I asked, because it is useful to look farther along the road than the next ditch, if only to decide which shoes are worth ruining.

“The judge will do math,” Seren said. “She will take the old doctrine, subtract humiliation, add precedent, divide by the number of blue bulbs it takes to keep a room calm, and call the quotient mercy. She will give you a status you don’t want and insist it is what you asked for. She will write your Q with better penmanship.”

“What does that mean for me,” I asked, and my voice put its hands in its pockets because it did not want to be polite about the answer.

“It means, darling,” Seren said, and the endearment was not unkind, only efficient, “that the city will say you exist for the purpose of being corrected. It will insist that recognition is a kind of kindness and then use that kindness to lay jurisdiction on your shoulders like a scarf you cannot remove in summer.”

“It also means,” Noema said, and her tone left less room for adjectives than Seren’s, “that we can count you without lying. It means the men who have been practicing being present in back rooms can take their names into streets without every blue bulb in a three-block radius pretending not to see them. It means we get to lose neatly or win untidily, depending on whether you keep choosing the large version of your name.”

Sir Edward yawned in a language that meant, I will bite anyone who tries to change my dish. The day outside tried, for a second, to be yellow and then remembered its contract. I folded the scarf as if it were a map and put it in my jacket, which is the closest I have ever come to packing well. The wire settled at my sternum like a doctrine that had agreed, for today, to behave. Noema adjusted the collar of my shirt as if I were about to greet her mother. Seren checked her pen the way a surgeon checks his knives, then checked my face the way a good lawyer checks the source of a rumor.

The crowd at the Care Court had learned a new trick overnight: it had come to resemble itself. People brought their lungs as if permission had been granted to breathe in public. Women with hair like ledger lines stood where the shadow of the building taught them to. Men who had practiced being holes wore jackets. The blue bulbs hummed in unison like a choir with a reliable soprano and no taste. The drones ran their stitches above us and proved once more that surveillance is ugly embroidery; it makes a shape no one asked to wear.

The veils were early, which is how you know the Root had decided to decorate timing with appetite. They stood under the arch like polite thunder. The judge came out from her little house of texts and banged the gavel with a touch that tried to give wood a personality. It is hard to bully furniture into caring. She looked at the scarf where it lay on my arm and pretended not to be curious. I looked at her hands and imagined the weight they have carried in private and the neatness with which she has burned it off, so as not to stain the table.

“We will begin,” she said, and the room practiced not flinching. “The Matron-Root’s writ is before us. The Court has granted standing for the purpose of clarification. The question is whether this person is to be treated as a person for purposes of custody or as an item for purposes of recall.” The word item sat on the table and imagined it was an animal. We watched it behave and were not convinced.

The veiled woman advanced one measured step, as if she had learned to walk on grammar and still preferred the feel of stone. She did not lower her veil. She did not say Elsin’s name. The veil spoke for her in a voice sewn to fit. “The Root rescinds its writ,” it said, and the sentence did not trip over itself not once, which is how you know it had been practiced until it was skin. “The arithmetic fails on inspection. The cradle cannot claim what it miscounted without admitting the count is bad. The doctrine is corrected. The subject remains subject to care.” The last word curled like a cat permitted on a chair by a woman who does not like cats.

It should have been relief. Perhaps for other men it would have been, and perhaps other cities would have noticed that a woman had eaten a rule in public and applauded. Our city does a different math. A murmur rose and sat down. The blue bulbs flickered and then decided to be stern about it. The judge inclined her head like a woman accepting a compliment from an old enemy with proper form. “Noted,” she said. “Rescission enters. The Court will proceed to determination.”

Seren’s eyes flashed, and not at the word rescind. She is not fond of a room that pretends it can move on without tripping over the thing you put on the floor to make it fall. “Before you proceed,” she said, and her politeness was a threat with a satin hem, “you will put into your record that the Root has admitted arithmetic failure. You will not call it an adjustment. You will not call it a courtesy. You will name it error. Precedent survives on adjectives.”

The judge’s mouth tried out a disdain it did not have time to develop into art. She nodded to the clerk, who wrote error with a hand that had been trained to write correction and found the former more honest in its wrist. The veiled woman did not move because she is older than adjectives and knows that a certain kind of pen has to tire itself out before the room can breathe again.

Then the judge said the sentence that makes rooms sentimental. “The Court recognizes Mr. Quinn as a person for the purposes of care, custody, and correction,” she said, and if you think I did not flinch at the third item you have been reading the wrong book. “His presence is now recorded and his name will attach to his record. He will be subject to summons and sanction. He will be permitted to petition and to appeal.” The clerk wrote my Q and the curve bloomed without protest this time, which nearly undid me more than the first, because ease can be crueler than resistance when it comes from a hand that would have preferred to hesitate.

Noema pressed my sleeve, not in reassurance but in reminder: do not let them define the terms of your miracle and then call it theirs. Seren did not smile, which is how I know she was pleased. She turned her head and looked at the crowd because the room’s mouth was not the only one that mattered. The breath in the benches tried to behave and failed adorably. Somewhere behind me a child asked if I was a kind of weather. I did not turn to answer, which is one of the hardest things I have done.

“Mr. Quinn,” the judge said, and you could taste the warning like lemon on the back of your tongue, “you are now under the Court’s protection and authority. Do you understand?” She expected me to be grateful. She expected me to bow to a shelter with holes in it and call the bruises my fault.

“I understand that you have taught your paper how to draw my letter,” I said, and the bell in the laughmeter in the corner tried to be a cough. “I understand that you would like me to be available for correction now that you can count me. I understand that you intend to love me the way this city loves things it can feed. I also understand that you are leaving out a word older than your bench. You left out present.”

The judge opened her mouth and found I had already put a spoon there. She did not choke. She chewed. “Be careful,” she said softly enough to make the blue bulbs lean in. “You are brave. Do not let bravery make you fragile.”

The veil turned as if the habit of turning could undo anything. You could feel Elsin’s approval in the air the way you feel clean linen in a room that has been honest about its sweat. The word rescind hung on my shoulders like a garment fit by a tailor who forgot to ask how much I could lift. The boys along the wall—men with names now, men with pockets like small crimes—shifted their weight and tried to figure out where to put it now that there was a place.

We did not get to enjoy the taste of the words because the city is allergic to ending a sentence where you would like it to. The drones stitched a new pattern, the one that says Audience, we are trying to look casual about this. A row of Caretakers entered with the clean briskness of rain in a film where rain is a stand-in for God. They took up positions that pretended to be about exit safety and were in fact about proximity. An Aunt in a uniform the color of polite violence raised a hand with two fingers extended in a signal that would have meant nothing if I hadn’t grown up in rooms where women talk to walls to get things done.

Noema ghosted something into my ear without moving her lips so that anyone with a camera would think she was considering God. “We will give them a distraction,” she said. “They will try to harvest petitions while they have the crowd. We will misfile them in public. You will walk.”

“Where,” I asked, because sometimes obedience is the cleverest choice, and she deserves to see me be clever in the direction she prefers.

“Back to the Lyric,” she said. “Through the market that pretends it did not open. Through the alley that thinks it is a seam. We left a door in the wall last night. It will be there as long as we do not look at it.”

Seren was no longer beside me; she was in three places at once and had arranged for the other two to be believed more strongly than the one I saw. She lifted her chin at the scarf, which is her way of asking if I have remembered how to live with props. I slung it over my shoulder like a half-finished sentence. The judge banged the gavel and the sound landed like a gift in a room that had run out of things to unwrap. “Adjourned,” she said, this time in her own throat, and the crowd did what crowds do when they do not plan to behave later: they behaved beautifully for a minute so they’d have something to compare the evening to.

We left in a tide the building pretended to have predicted. The veils did not follow, which means Elsin was proving she could lose correctly. I felt the boy in my chest adjust his posture—he has opinions about hallways—and I let him pick the cadence of my feet. The square received us like a table too small for the number of plates and everyone generous about their elbows. A woman with a wicker bag said my name without intending to and then covered her mouth because in this city affection is an accident you apologize for. The blue bulbs kept their tone like a choir mistress with excellent discipline and no interest in music.

The market did that thing it does when it is trying to be invisible to the law: it made beauty boring. Fruit sat like respectability. Bread pretended to be undramatic. A boy chalked numbers that the city approved of. We threaded the aisles as if we had a shopping list. Noema kept one hand in her pocket where she could feel the wire she’d sewn into my jacket if she needed to make it do more than confuse a hungry drone. Seren reappeared at my periphery and inserted a small folded paper into my sleeve without letting her fingers look like hands. “They will come for me if they are clumsy,” she said under the sound of someone dropping a pan three stalls away at the wrong time with the right purpose. “If they are clever, they will let me come to them. Either way, do not look. It would be impolite to make this scene about love.”

“I thought it was about law,” I said, because I like to hear the way she corrects me when she does.

“It always was the same thing,” she said, and moved as if she had not spoken, which is her art.

The door Noema had promised behaved like a pet that has learned not to bark. It was there and then it was behind us and then it was nothing because the building had misremembered it on purpose. The Lyric took us in with its old habits: the subtle smell of yeast and nerves, the stage’s sulk at being abandoned and then asked to forgive. Sir Edward performed his ritual of disdain at the threshold and then deigned to be in the same room as my relief. I took the scarf off my shoulder and laid it on the chair where he could claim it with hair later; he gave me the narrow-eyed look of a banker approving a risky investment.

We did not sit. Noema paced the way a woman paces when she intends to move a building by the repetition of her steps. Seren wrote on air with that pen of hers and the air remembered until our breath bullied the letters into corners. The laughmeter on the wall clicked once and then twice as if it had been thinking about clapping and decided to be restrained. The floor had that pre-storm calm rooms develop when they are about to be asked to host something improper. We waited without pretending patience.

News in this city arrives in layers, each one thinking it is more important than the last. The first layer was visible through the window: the blue bulbs on Vesper Street flickered not because the grid failed, but because the street had picked the wrong hymn and the choir refused to switch. The second came by boy, a little runner from the Widow’s Circuit with a cap too big for his head and an instruction not to be seen by anyone who writes fines for a living; he put a note in Noema’s hand and did not look at me because it is bad luck to acknowledge the person in the room who might have to be brave next. The third was that hard-to-hear quiet that precedes a practical decision by someone with a real badge.

“They are issuing summons,” Noema said, pressing the paper flat with her palm. “Not arrests. The language is public-pleasant. They want compliance with a voluntary hearing for those who attended last night’s event and this morning’s determination. They will interpret nonattendance as consent.”

“That is a joke that needs better tailoring,” Seren said. “You will not go.”

“I will go,” I said, because sometimes the only way to walk past a rope is to trip over it while everyone is still watching. “I am a person now. I should practice.”

Noema looked up and the look had three words in it: no, later, please. “We use the petition,” she said instead, because she knows I like papers better than ropes when the day can’t decide whether it prefers theater. “If they wish to ask you questions, they can do it on ours. We will call it a compliance rehearsal. We will host it here. They can send their best mouths and we will set out bread.”

Seren’s eyes did a thing I have come to learn means she can feel the angle of the city changing. “They will come,” she said. “They cannot resist a compliance rehearsal. It is a phrase that flatters their religion.”

“They will come,” Noema agreed, “and they will bring machines designed to count breath and assign it value. We will feed the machines names until their needles stop behaving.” She looked at me and her severity softened into advice. “Eat now. It is going to be one of those afternoons where lunch was a rumor.”

Sir Edward put his paw on the scarf as if he had been appointed to witness our contract. I chewed bread that fought me and swallowed tea that did not apologize for its temperature. The men of the Circuit came in ones and twos, and they did not make the room feel brave, which is why I trust them. They made the room feel stubborn. They took the chairs that did not match and sat. They put their hats under their chairs like men who intend to leave if asked to pretend anything at all. The Aunts arrived with their nets folded and their eyebrows immaculate. The Caretakers came with their good posture and the drones found the fixture on the ceiling that flatters their sense of height.

The woman the Court sent had no veil, which I admired. She wore the uniform of someone whose job is to make rooms behave and whose hobby is to make men believe they want to. She took no chair. She remained standing because some bodies are more legible that way, and because she has learned to use furniture only when she is prepared to make it hers. “Compliance rehearsal,” she said, in a voice trained to be noted verbatim. “How novel.”

“Novelty is how we keep old ideas from remembering they were once alive,” Serena murmured, and the official’s ear did not flinch, which is a sign of training and also an advertisement for poor literature.

Noema did the introductions with none of the frills the city had taught her she might put on such a moment if she wanted to be invited to the party afterward. “Mr. Quinn,” she said, and the bell chose this moment to clear its throat. “He has standing. He has a name. He will answer questions today. We will answer with him when our religion requires it.” The official’s glance moved like an audit. When it landed on me it was not unkind, which is why I did not entirely trust it.

The rehearsal began with ritual. They asked to see the scarf, and I let them look because there is power in depriving a tool of mystery and watching professionals try to make do with the remaining fear. They asked whether the meters last night had been tampered with; Noema said yes, politely, and pointed out that calibration is a civic duty. They asked whether Seren had instructed me to say my name at the Court; Seren said no, and that yes are tricky animals, and that sometimes the only way to be accurate is to tell the wrong truth with the proper timing. They asked me whether I intended to continue to be public. I said I intended to continue to be present. It is not the same thing. It is worse.

Then they asked the question that had been folded into all the others like a blade into bread. “Will you present yourself for correction when summoned,” the official said, and you could hear the muscles around her throat preparing themselves to pretend they were a conscience. The men in the room did what men do when a woman asks them to volunteer for a procedure: they watched my hands and decided what they would do with theirs later depending on whether I used mine badly.

“I will present myself,” I said, and felt Noema’s fingers smoke against my sleeve, “for record. I will answer to my name in the rooms that have learned to write it. I will not consent to correction, because that suggests you understand what is wrong with me. You do not.” I let the scarf drop off the back of the chair and it made a sound as it hit the stage that a clever microphone might hear as permission and a cleverer one might hear as a threat. “I will accept consequence. That is the trade we have been making in kitchens since before the Care learned to put its apron on.”

The official did not frown. She wrote something down and looked up with the patience of a woman who was taught to count to ten while other people die and discovered she can make ten last for a season. “We will report your refusal to cooperate with correction,” she said evenly. “We will praise your willingness to appear. The Court will decide the spectrum on which you are to be seen.” She did not say good day, she did not say brave, she did not say mistake. She folded her pad as if folding an argument too thin to hold anything and left with her Caretakers, who managed to keep their feet from saying what their faces wanted to say about the way the scarf had behaved in their professional air.

The room exhaled into its straps. Seren sat on the arm of a chair like a woman who has just taught herself a new crime and is trying it on for fit. “They will call you to the Square,” she said. “They will put you on a platform built in the same year they built the gallows and insist the difference is taste. They will call it a civic recital on the subject of clarity. They will ask you to read a text. They will tell you the line breaks are nonnegotiable.”

“What’s the text,” I asked, even though I knew the answer by the way the blue bulbs outside learned to sigh when they remember their shift is not done.

“Their doctrine,” Noema said. “Revised before print. It will say you are present. It will also say you are property for the purpose of protection. It will sharpen the part where they can tell you when to leave a room and where to stand in one. It will let boys breathe and require them to ask permission for oxygen. It is a kindness printed with a blade.”

“I will not read it,” I said, and the boy in my chest moved with the sort of satisfaction that makes cowards charming.

“You will,” Seren said, and before I could be offended she continued with the cruelty of a true friend. “You will stand on the platform they intend to own and you will take their text because we are not sentimental about paper and because this is a performance. You will read once. Then you will fold the text, set it down, and read a better one. You will do it with a crowd’s lungs and a building’s memory and a scarf that has learned to be a bridge. You will make them say present until the meters understand they have been counting the wrong phenomenon all these years.”

“And then?” I asked. “Because after the trick comes the bill.”

“Then they will try to bring the net over your head,” Noema said. “And then the square will show them which is larger: a doctrine or a crowd that has learned to count itself out loud.” She did not pretend confidence. She adjusted the wire in my jacket with two fingers until the seam stopped looking apologetic. “And then we will take you home. Or we will take you somewhere else we have taught to be kind to men who get tired in public.”

There are hours that a city has learned to look away from because it does not trust itself not to arrest the weather. Late afternoon is one of them. People pretend to be busy so they have an excuse not to go where things are happening. We went where things were happening because cultivating excuses is not among our vices. The Square had grown a platform overnight, plain as a sermon and twice as pleased with itself. The blue bulbs hummed in a key familiar to anyone who has ever stood still under them and tried to remember whether their name was theirs. The crowd arranged itself into patterns that would scan well on an aerial survey and poorly in a poem. The judge’s bench had come outdoors and looked at the sky as if wondering whether it was permitted.

They brought me the text on official paper that knows how to carry guilt politely. The official from the Lyric handed it to me without the drama this town expects and accepted in exchange a nod that admitted we both were working for institutions that had invented polite ways to harm in order to be allowed to be useful. Across the square, the veils collected light without owning it. The Root had decided to be present in the way thunder is: audibly, and from a distance that keeps witnesses safe from its etiquette.

The microphone on the platform had enjoyed rehearsals at other men’s mouths for years. It announced me with a hum of self-importance it had learned from judges. I looked at the text. The first line was a proper noun that pretended to be a country. The second was a sentence about care that had eaten too many adjectives and forgotten how to chew pronouns. The third was a clause that narrowed the throat without raising the volume. I looked up at the crowd and saw a thousand faces I could not see and a thousand bodies that could not pretend they did not exist. I began where the paper wanted me to begin.

I read the first paragraph without changing its weather. I let the room hear how pretty harm sounds when professionals sing it. I read the second and the boy in my chest curled like a hand around my ribs in the posture of patience. At the end of the third I folded the paper and set it on the lectern, and the microphones, which have been designed to tell the truth and not to love it, followed me anyway. I put both hands on the stand because I am a superstitious man and because the scarf wanted, for a moment, to be a throat.

“My name is Jax Quinn,” I said, and the square did not gasp because it was busy deciding what it would do for a living next. “The text says I am present, and that I am under care. The text says I am subject to correction. The text says I am a person when it helps the city and an item when it helps its appetite. I am going to read you a better text. You will decide whether you prefer to be counted or to count.”

There is a tone a crowd takes when it discovers it has been offered more agency than it wanted. It is a frightened tone and a greedy one. I spoke into that tone as if it were the only one I deserved. I read the names of rooms first: House of Milk, Hall of Cradles, Care Court, Widow’s Lyric, Market of Legal Bread. I read the names of things that have been taught to behave: mirror, bulb, net, drone, gavel. Then I read the names of people who had been taught to be quiet and had decided to fail. I read Beatrice. I read Stanley. I read Hector. I read Darren. I read the names their mothers use when they are alone. I read the names we made up for ourselves when the official ones refused to stick. I read mine until the bell did not know where to put its meaning and put it everywhere.

The square murmured and then stopped and then breathed, which is the order of operations for small revolutions. At the edge of the crowd, an Aunt lifted her net because else what is a woman to do with her hands in a public place where mischief is afoot. The net hung there like a threat so gentle it thought it was kindness. Noema’s wire in my jacket warmed as if reminding the lamps that they were not the only light in town. Seren’s pen wrote in air and the air kept what it could and let the rest go like a decent god.

Someone threw something and for once it was not a rock. It was a piece of glass, the good kind, cut proper, backed with silver that has had its morals checked. It hit the platform at an angle and skittered to a stop where it could see my shoes. I looked down. For a moment I let myself look, because a boy I once was liked to see whether he could catch himself in a trick. The shard returned me badly. It was enough. The crowd saw that it was enough. The mirror did not blush. It did not apologize for its fidelity. It gave me back like a promise you write on a wall inside your own head and do not show the law.

The Aunts moved. They are trained to interpret moments like this as invitations. The Caretakers drew their perimeter lines in their minds and registered where they intersected between plans. The drones above us found new stitches to run that would look good on tomorrow’s paper. The veils watched without moving because history does not fidget. I was going to keep reading. I was going to read until I had no voice. The boy in my chest pulled on my attention with the insistent tact of a child who needs a door opened now. He showed me a path.

It was not a plan. It was a posture. I stepped back from the microphone. I took the scarf off my shoulder. I tied it around the stand, not as strangulation but as a flag. It hummed. The microphones found the hum like dogs who had been trained to think that tone belongs to the people who pay them. The hum went through the square and into the wires and down the block and under the street and through the kitchen where Elsin Reed had taught a spoon how to behave. The city learned, in that second, what it had been pretending not to know. It had taught the glass to forget us. We had taught the air to remember.

“You are present,” I said into the hum, and I did not mean me. “Say it.”

They did. Not all of them. Enough. They said present and the meters clapped from inside their sealed faces and the blue bulbs adjusted their pitch and the drones rethreaded and somebody in the third row dropped to her knees the way you do when your body has decided to be a metaphor without asking your permission. The Aunts stepped forward and the nets met the hum and wavered because a tool that thinks it is ready for any phenomenon is embarrassed to encounter the one it was not told to practice for.

The official from the Lyric pushed through with a face that had learned something and did not like it. She came up onto the platform without disturbing its dignity and put her hand down on the text I had folded. The gesture was proprietary and intimate and professional. “Enough,” she said, not to me. “Enough for today.” She was not smiling. She was telling her side to stop digging. The judge, who had taken a position at one corner of the square where she could pretend to be surprised and be believed, nodded once. The veils turned away because they know when a day has decided to write a different line than the one they prepared.

We left the platform without theatrics. I did not bow. The crowd did not throw itself under anyone’s net on my behalf. The boys did not attempt to save me. That is a particular kind of triumph. In the alley behind the Square, where the city keeps its undone sentences, I leaned on brick and discovered brick does not mind men who have been used by microphones. Noema put her hand on the back of my neck in that exact place where someone learned to hold my head under water thirty years ago and pulled my face forward until my forehead touched hers. It was not a kiss. It was a calibration.

“You will not be allowed to leave the city,” she said, as if I had asked. “Not now, perhaps not ever. You are ours. That is a condition and an honor and a prison.”

“I did not intend to go,” I said. “There is nowhere else that would bother to miscount me with such flair.”

Seren wiped her pen on the hem of her sleeve and tutted at herself for having grown attached to a tool. “Tomorrow,” she said, because she is a woman allergic to endings, “they will invent a department. It will be new enough to be dangerous and old enough to be hungry. It will have a name like Present Affairs. It will be staffed by men who want to be fathers and women who want to be sons. It will ask to see your papers. It will issue a card with your name on it that will make you go soft in the knees for three days and then make you want to burn the building that printed it.”

“What do we do,” I asked, tired of asking how and when and ready to finally lean into the juvenile question that keeps all complicated adults alive.

“We ruin their department gently,” Noema said. “We make it essential and then make it ridiculous. We fill its inbox. We teach men to make appointments and then speak in the waiting room. We ask it to define presence until it has to admit that it cannot, and then we offer to help.” She looked up at the sky, which had come to a color you could forgive if you did not know its history. “We keep saying names.”

Back at the Lyric, the chair had written itself around the shape of my absence and took me in without complaint. Sir Edward came and sat with the sort of sacrament only cats can officiate. I took the paper from my sleeve that Seren had tucked there and finally opened it because you do not leave anything folded near your heart for very long in this town; it either turns into a blade or it turns into a bandage. It was a list, but not of names. It was a list of rooms: kitchens; staircases; vestibules; porches; alleys that had forgotten they were alleys and wanted to be seams. Next to each was a small mark that meant a candle, or a fuse, or a person who had promised to hold breath at the right time.

There was one more paper on the table that I had not put there. Noema’s handwriting, neat as the inside of a good song, said simply that a boy had come to the back door while we were gone and left something that would not fit very well into any doctrine. It was a drawing, folded, and when I unfolded it I felt my chest admit air it had been ashamed of needing. It was a picture of a hand with a small scar on the knuckle in the shape of a V that was now a vowel and will someday be a verb. Under it, in patient block letters learned from a woman who had taught him that this is how you get rooms to listen, a child had written present and had spelled it correctly without help.

Night in this city is where feeling goes to change names and go back out pretending to be a fact. The blue bulbs gave up pretending to be a sky. The drones pretended to be stars and were not believed. The laughmeter clicked and then, for the first time since I put it on that wall, it stopped counting me and counted the room instead. I went to the window and looked at our ugly street and I saw men walking without shrinking their shoulders and women looking full on at things their mothers had warned them not to look at because to look is to owe. I saw a city beginning to remember something it had mislaid on purpose.

I slept and dreamed not of doors but of mirrors. In the dream they learned my name the way a dog learns the word for come home. They still did not show me clean; I do not ask them to. They gave me back what was necessary for walking. In the morning, if the city permitted a morning, I would wake to find a card slid under my door with my name spelled right by a machine that does not understand forgiveness. I would pick it up. I would decide whether to carry it like a blessing or a burden. I would teach it the weight of me. I would walk out with my jacket on and my wire humming and my scarf behaving and I would go teach a new department how to count without making a death of it.
