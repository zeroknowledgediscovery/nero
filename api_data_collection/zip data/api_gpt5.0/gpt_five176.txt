The day the letter came was a Monday, slate gray and dragging its heels like a child being pulled to school. The mail slot in the front door coughed up three glossy flyers, a coupon for a pizza place that burned everything, a card addressed to “Resident,” and one stiff envelope with a logo that seemed to shine even in the dim hallway where the overhead bulb ticked and clicked and thought about going out. I had flour on my fingers from breakfast duty and wiped them twice on my skirt before I picked it up.

Sing for the Skyline, it said, in a cursive that curled like ribbon candy, like something you could lick and it would taste like strawberry. Underneath, a starburst and my name, my actual name, spelled right, which never happens to me except when it’s a bill or a shutdown notice. Leda. There are so many ways to get it wrong. Lita. Lena. Linda. The only person who never messed it up was Mom. She said it was light in Greek and made a joke about the irony every time we had the brownouts that swallowed our house for hours.

I didn’t open it right away. I took it to the kitchen, where the window faced east and the light came in from three backyards away and crossed the sink in stripes. The kettle rattled on the stove. Mrs. Pritchard had left a note that said: CHEESE. GOAT? NO. And underlined it so hard I could see the scratches in the paint. The house smelled like toast and the soap that never quite washed off your plates, a lemon that was more like the idea of lemon. I put the envelope next to the note, next to the block of cheddar with a bite taken out of it (not me), and I washed my hands again, and then I watched my hands make themselves open the envelope.

Finalist Confirmation, it said. The paper was smooth, like it had been ironed. We are delighted to inform you that your performance at the Springfield Regional Qualifier has earned you a place in the FINAL event. Please be present for check-in at 7 a.m. at the Memorial Arena, Gate C, no later than Saturday, June 12. Small print that ran along the bottom in a gray so pale it was almost shy: Bring identification. Bring your original song. No bands. No accompaniment other than what you can carry in your hand.

I knew the date even before I looked at the calendar over the stove to check. Two weeks. Two weeks until the lights. Until the stage that never shook, the microphone that never crackled, the judges with teeth brighter than snow. I said it out loud to the empty kitchen. “Two weeks,” and the room gave the sound back to me and turned it into something that sounded like hope from far away.

Someone ran up the back stairs. The door banged. A boy’s voice said, “You owe me two dollars for bringing your busted hair dryer back to life,” and then Noah was in the doorway, smelling like rain even though it hadn’t. His coat was on inside out and he had a red streak on his forehead like a thumbprint. He grinned at me and then stopped, midstep, like he’d hit an invisible rope across the room.

“What’s that?” he said.

“Read it.” My fingers were shaking. It felt foolish and real at the same time, like helium in your lungs. I watched Noah’s eyes race across the page, then slow, then look up. He’s younger than me by two years and somehow older in all the ways that matter. His mother married my father when we were eleven and thirteen, and then she died, and then he died, and the math makes a shape you can’t live inside, but we did anyway. The system kept us together because we yelled and screamed until it did, until they wrote it down in a code that looked like a short bandage across the bottom of a report. Step-brother. Not blood, which is supposed to matter more, but who decides that? He does. I do.

“Lee,” he said. “Is this real?”

“I auditioned,” I said. It came out too fast. “I told you, last month.”

“I know,” he said. He didn’t look at the letter. He looked at me like he was trying to see deeper, like there was a slide he could put me under and bring the world into focus. “Where?”

“The old Springfield Library,” I said. “They took over the basement. It’s the Regional Qualifier.”

Noah’s mouth tilted. “We don’t have Regionals at the Library,” he said. “We have paper-mold and bored high schoolers sleeping on their textbooks.”

“They set it up different. There were lights. Folding chairs. A kind of, I don’t know, temporary stage thing.”

He did the thing where he scratched behind his ear when he didn’t want to call me a liar and didn’t want to call me anything else. “Okay,” he said. “That’s what they do. Pop-up style. You going to sing your river song?”

“It’s not a river song,” I said, even though it was. “It’s called Passenger Pigeon.”

“Sure,” he said. He put the letter down on the counter and leaned in until his forehead bumped mine. The red streak brushed my hair. “You’re going to knock them into next week. And then you’ll have to wait for them to come back to give you the trophy.”

“No trophies,” I said, but my mouth hurt from smiling. The kettle began to scream. I turned and poured boiling water into the mug with the chip on the lip, the one that says PITCH, and I thought about that word, about the way it can mean throwing something away, or the sound that finds you in the dark.

He flicked the letter with his short nail. “Gate C, huh? That’s the one by the loading dock. I’ll carry your bag. We’ll go so early we’ll have to wake up the sun.”

“You hate mornings.”

“For this I’ll decaf myself,” he said solemnly. “Tell Mrs. P you’re going to be famous. Ask her if we can paint the porch first so it looks good on TV.”

“Mrs. Pritchard would rather burn the porch than have it on TV,” I said, and then Mrs. Pritchard herself came in, hair in a bandanna that used to be white, elbows sharp and carved out of worry. She sniffed the room like she could smell trouble. She always has a tuning fork inside her chest and when it vibrates, everything starts to ring.

“Who ate the cheese?” she said. Her eyes found the letter and then she looked away from it like it was a gun and she had been trained not to look directly at danger. “Don’t lean on my counter. Both of you.”

“Leda’s in the finals,” Noah said, ignoring her rules like he always does. He painted the word finals with his voice so it looked like a banner. He tapped the crisp black letters with one finger. “Memorial. Gate C. June twelfth.”

Mrs. Pritchard’s mouth pinched. She is the kind of woman who takes ahold of her feelings and folds them like laundry until they’re small enough to fit in a drawer. “We’ll see,” she said. “That’s the kind of thing that goes away if you look at it too hard. Like soap bubbles.”

“It’s real,” I said. “I have the letter.”

“I have letters,” she said, and held up her stack of bills. “They’re all real, too. Trash goes out on Thursdays. You put it on the curb and it’s somebody else’s problem for a little while and then it comes back to you with interest. Coffee?”

Noah laughed. The sound hit the wall and bounced back and made the window glass tremble. I love that about him. He can laugh even when the things in the room have edges. And Mrs. Pritchard, who has so many edges she could cut a watermelon just by looking at it, couldn’t help it; the side of her mouth softened. Something like almost-kindness shone through the cracks. She poured coffee for herself and for me without asking, as if the fact of me being there implied a cup in my hand.

“Sing something,” she said. “If you’re so sure.”

“Not now,” I said, and hated the way fear jumped up my throat when I said it. A weasel of a feeling, darting fast. I love to sing. That’s the whole point. But to be asked in the kitchen, with the morning still holding onto itself, with the toaster ticking and the clock swallowing minutes? It’s easier when it’s late and the house is asleep and the radiator hisses like a crowd that hasn’t decided to like you yet.

“You’ll have to do it in the daylight,” Mrs. Pritchard said, not meanly. “They’re not going to turn off the sun for you.”

Noah saved me. “She’ll sing tonight,” he said. “We’ll set the stage in the parlor. I’ll put the lamp on the floor so it shines up and makes her look dramatic. She’ll be like a ghost, but a nice ghost, the kind that returns library books on time.”

“Pah.” Mrs. Pritchard waved her hand. “Ghosts are only nice in movies. Don’t forget to mop under the dining table. The twins dropped their cereal like they were feeding pigeons. Pigeons with standards.”

“They do have standards,” I said, taking my coffee with me as I passed into the hall. “They refuse to eat anything shaped like stars.”

The hall was longer than it should have been and smelled like damp boots and raincoats—again, no rain, the city had been dry for a week, the river frizzing with heat where it cut past the mill. I kept the letter in my hand because I couldn’t not. In the sitting room, the upright piano leaned slightly to the left as if it was listening carefully to something I couldn’t hear. The top was crowded with things that didn’t belong anywhere else: an iron horse from some kid’s birthday cake, a jar with two nails in it and a tooth that had been boiled to whiteness, a small map of somewhere no one in the house had ever been. I slid the letter under the map. I wanted to pin it to a wall, but then I could see it being torn down by a rogue breeze. Paper has its own ideas about where to go.

I was late for the lunch shift at the diner. The Turnpike is named for the road that runs along its north wall, six lanes of trucks and cars and sometimes, late at night, motorcycles that cry like something that’s lost something and doesn’t know what it is. The owner, Hanna, says if she had to name it again she’d call it the Forklift because that’s what you need to get the fryer out of the kitchen when it breaks. When I walked in, she did the eye thing, left, right, left, as if I might be bringing trouble on a string like a helium balloon.

“You look like you slept,” she said, as if it were an accusation.

“I did,” I said.

“Miracles.” She handed me an apron that had lived so long it qualified as a resident. “Merle’s out. Flu or wife. Don’t ask.”

“I already know too much,” I said, and tied the apron around my waist and cut lemons while Cole on the grill whistled the same four bars of “Moon River” he always whistles when he’s thinking about who’s left him and why.

“You still doing that show?” Cole said, his back to me. His spatula made a rhythm on the flat top, a drumline that needed practice.

“The final,” I said. “I got the letter.”

“Brass ring,” he said. He says that whenever anyone gets something they want. I think he lived at the state fair in another life. He pushed two a.m. eggs toward me on a plate. The woman at table eight had ordered breakfast at noon and would leave the sausage links untouched like most people do if you watch them long enough. “Get me an autograph from the host.”

“You know his name,” Hanna said. “We watch the show every Sunday.”

“Don’t say the name,” Cole said. “Bad luck.” He turned and saw the way I was holding the lemons too tight and softened his voice. “You’ll be great.”

The truth is that when you work a place long enough, the shape of it fits you more than whatever you imagine elsewhere. I know how to move behind the counter without hitting anyone with my hip. I can carry five glasses in one hand. I can spot a man who will get angry before he does and a woman who will cry but try not to. The diner called me back to my body. The letter made me float, but the floor wanted my feet. It always does.

Between the lunch rush and the workers who came in at two with their shirts stuck to their backs, I took a breath and leaned against the walk-in cooler. It hummed in my spine. I took out my phone and held the letter where the camera could see it. I meant to send Noah a picture because he is the kind of person who needs proof and proof of proof. He’ll fold a thing and unfold it until it gives up and says the truth on its surface. But the light in the kitchen had made the silver on the logo shine and the picture came out like a photograph of a ghost. You could see the words, but also not, a trick of the glass in the camera. I took another one. That one was better, the starburst ordinary now, just ink. I texted him: Look. He wrote back an all-caps wow that included too many o’s and then: You’re a comet. And then: Gate C Gate C Gate C.

I didn’t tell anyone else. Not then. I thought about telling Mr. Ruiz when I went for milk later and he would pretend to know all about the show because he pretends to know all about everything and then he would tell me a story about his cousin who sang in a mariachi band and once got to hold a guitar that belonged to a guy who had once stood on the same stage as a guy who had been on TV. I thought about not telling Mrs. Delaney at the laundromat because she thinks I should be a legal secretary and thinks she thinks we all should be whatever sits still, whatever doesn’t ask too much of the world. I didn’t tell Coach Rhea because she would make me do scales until the inside of my mouth felt like a smoothed-out river stone.

But I went to see Rhea anyway, after my shift. Her apartment is above a nail salon and the stairwell is decorated with old posters for musicals, edges curling like the corners of a smile. She calls herself a coach because teacher sounds official and she lost her official certificates in a flood in a place that doesn’t flood. She opened the door in her socks and her eyes slipped over me and then found whatever it is in me that makes her say, weekly, “You open up like a door and then—” and then she mimes the slam.

“I got the letter,” I said, before she could talk about doors, before she could ask whether I had done my breathing exercises. I held it out to her like a piece of cake.

She took it between two fingers, like it might leave a mark. She didn’t comment on the starburst. She never comments on packaging. She read it and then she turned it over. The back was blank. She held it up to the light. “Okay,” she said, finally. “Okay, then.”

“You don’t believe it,” I said.

She squinted. “I believe it as much as I can believe a thing that has not yet happened. Sing.”

I sang. “Passenger Pigeon,” the song that is a river song but has birds in it because I needed something that flies that wasn’t me, because when you put yourself in the sky you fall faster. It starts low and then goes back to the same note again and again like knocking on a locked door and asking to be let in, except who’s inside? I sang like it was night and no one could hear me except someone two houses over who had fallen asleep with the radio on, I sang like the river ran under the floor and I was the one who could talk to it. I watched Rhea’s eyes close. I watched her shoulders release. I didn’t mess up the end, which is always where I mess up. I swam through it and came out on the far bank and I was still breathing.

“You are almost not lying to yourself,” she said, which is her version of flowers. “Again. But this time don’t do the thing where you hold it in your throat like a coin you forgot you put there.”

“I don’t do that,” I said, and then I did. She rolled her eyes and threw one of her socks at me. It smelled like dust and fabric softener and something like the past. I sang it again and this time I let my body be a room instead of a hallway. She smiled with one corner of her mouth and said, “Now sing the alphabet like you mean it.”

We worked for an hour. My chin did the thing my chin does, up instead of down. My toes curled. The air didn’t get any cooler, even though I know I sang in a way that moved things that weren’t sound. Twice someone pounded on the ceiling, the salon owner angry about the noise, the hose of acetone smell snaking up the stair every time our door opened. When I was done, my body made sweat in places it doesn’t normally, like the back of my knees and the line that runs along my ribs and then turns a corner.

“You okay?” she said finally, after she made me sit and hang my head and count out loud until I stopped feeling like I might cry for no reason.

“It’s just a lot,” I said. The letter was on the coffee table. It looked like it belonged, like it had always been there. Some paper looks like a stranger, and some moves in and unpacked in your room while you were gone.

“Fame is a bruise made out of lights,” Rhea said, as if she’d said it before to someone who failed to understand. “You think you want it until you don’t. You think no one’s watching you until you trip.”

“I don’t want fame,” I said. “I want a door to open.”

She nodded. “That’s cleaner,” she said, and she ran a hand through her hair and found a bobby pin and put it between her teeth the way she always does when she has to say the true thing. “Your voice is smaller than the thing you think you’re going to do to the world. Which is normal. We are all smaller than what we imagine to be.” She shrugged, sharp little elegant bones under a sweater that had lost its shape. “We can make the small thing sing very loud. It isn’t dishonest. It’s art.”

On my way home I cut through the park where the bandstand sits like a white tooth in the middle of grass. I climbed up and stood on the plank floor and faced the benches like the good ghosts were sitting there and listening, their hands folded, waiting for their fake birds to fly. You can tell who sat here when the real bands came because the bench seats have scratches in the varnish where coins once pressed into wood. I sang one verse for the ghosts and two lines for myself and then I stopped because two kids were throwing a football and you either sing in public with your whole body and let it be or you don’t.

Noah met me at the end of our block. The block had one streetlight that buzzed and the sound gives me a headache if I notice it too much. He was wearing two jackets, layered wrong. He takes in the world like it’s weather and he never stops being surprised when he gets wet.

“I fixed the lamp for your fake stage,” he said. “And I made Mrs. P say she’d listen, which was like saying she had to let a raccoon ride on her shoulder. I used words like obligation and don’t you think it’s important that. She hates that one.”

“I’m tired,” I said. “Maybe tomorrow.”

“Tonight,” he said, and his eyes were the darker kind of brown, the kind with rings in it. “It’s better if you do the thing when you don’t want to. You can’t wait for a perfect window. There’s always a reflection you didn’t expect.”

“Fine,” I said, because he was right and because he would not stop if I didn’t. We crossed the street. A car went too fast and the driver’s face was tired and she held her phone between her ear and her shoulder. The porch light was on at our house, making a pale circle on the steps where someone had left a bundle of flyers for a painter who would pretend to repair your house and then tell you your house was unrepairable. I did not trip up the stairs. I have learned the trick of our steps.

The twins were fighting over the upright vacuum in the parlor like it was a sword. Mrs. Pritchard had put on lipstick that lived in a tube on the mantle and that she only wore to weddings and when she had to talk to the principal. She had combed her eyebrows into thin lines. The lamp was on the floor like Noah said. There was a stool in the middle of the room, no covering on it, just wood with a crack that has been there since Mr. Pritchard left for good and took the toolbox with him.

I stood on the stool because no song starts if you are sitting down. My hands did the thing they do, like they’re telling the rest of me to wait, and then I did not wait. I sang.

The song did not leave my mouth in a straight line. It never does, not really. It took a curve. It hung in the room. It bounced off the mirror over the mantle and became something else for a second and then remembered itself. I sang it like I meant it even when I was thinking about dinner and about how the garbage had to be put out and about the fact that maybe I do stand like a door and then become a wall. I made myself move, because singing is dancing with your lungs. Noah leaned forward on the couch like he was trying to catch the words in a cup. Mrs. Pritchard didn’t move at all.

When I was in the second chorus, the twins remembered the vacuum was a sword and started whispering about blood and honor and the cat hid itself behind the recliner. When I made the bridge, the one I invented last week because I always think bridges would be nice and then forget I laid them down, Mrs. Pritchard put her hand over her mouth. When I landed, where I land, on that last note that I stole from a sparrow who would like it back please, it was quiet.

“Again,” Noah said.

“Dinner,” Mrs. Pritchard said, at the exact same time. Then, softer, to herself more than me, “You can’t build a house out of wish.”

“I won’t,” I said, and I meant it more than I have ever meant anything. My throat hurt in a tiny place that I knew would be a bruise tomorrow, a circle somewhere invisible that I would touch with my mind and know was there.

The phone rang. It sounded like an alarm to announce our life. Mrs. Pritchard went to get it and said hello and then held it out to me with two fingers like it was a small animal. “It’s for you,” she said. “If it’s a scam tell them to come down here and take my broken dishwasher instead of my money.”

“Hello?” I said.

Static, then a voice that might have been a man, it might have been a recording, it might have been the air that lives in the wire. “Congratulations,” it said, and the word came out with too many syllables, as if the speaker had been practicing and had a mouth full of honey. “We look forward to seeing you at check-in, Gate C. Please bring your story. Be prepared to tell it.”

“My story?” I said. “What is that.”

The line hissed. The voice said, “Everyone has one,” and then the call ended. I stared at the phone until my eyes ached. The number was withheld. Noah leaned over my shoulder and tried to take the phone from me. I didn’t give it to him. The cat did the kneading thing on the arm of the couch like she was making bread.

“Spam,” Mrs. Pritchard said. “Someone’s trying to sell you a vacuum that cleans lies out of your carpet.”

“It sounded—” I said, and then didn’t, because the sound of the lamp turning itself off at the outlet filled the room like a piece of metal hitting concrete.

After dinner I took the letter upstairs and pinned it to the wall above my bed. The pin slid through the paper like it had been waiting. The air moved on my skin. The night did what it does, which is move in behind you while you’re looking at the day. Down the hall, the twins pretended to be asleep every time Mrs. Pritchard walked past their door. Somewhere a radio played to itself in a house that wasn’t ours. I could smell grass, which means Mr. Avery had mowed the strip that belongs to no one behind our Canadian neighbor’s fence.

I dreamed that night that I was on a stage, but that I had brought the stage with me. I carried it on my back and it was heavy. I dreamed I opened my mouth and the river came out, not a metaphor but water, and the judges held up cards that said numbers that didn’t make any sense, like nine and eleven and two and circles that were just circles not zeros meaning anything. I dreamed there was a door at the back of the stage and when I opened it, all the light fell off the floor and left us standing in the dark. I woke up with my hands pressed to the wall where the letter was because I must have reached for it in my sleep. There was a line of ink on my palm, blue, the word line with the dot over the i missing.

In the morning the kitchen was full of the smell of peanut butter toast and something like singed nylon. Noah was nowhere, which is not normal. He is always in my morning. Even if he is somewhere else, he is in it. Mrs. Pritchard slid a plate toward me with two pieces of toast and a banana that had more brown than yellow. Her eyes met mine and then did that thing where they went sideways and pretended to check the clock.

“Where’s Noah?” I said.

“Out,” she said.

“Out where?”

“If I asked him that, he would tell me a lie he was proud of making,” she said. “He left a note, which is further than usual.” She pushed a rip of lined paper toward me. It had a grocery list on the back. On the front it said: Fixing something. Don’t worry. Be there later. Keep the letter where the cat can’t eat it. —N.

“He leaves for school early sometimes,” I said, making a shape with my hand in the air like a lemon slice. “He goes to the shop by the tracks. The guy leaves stuff out, wires and circuit boards. He told me last week he found a radio that can hear trucks.”

“Mmm,” she said. “Don’t eat if you’re going to be late. Coffee travels faster than bread.”

I was late anyway. I was always late now that time had started to run like water in a place where the ground sloped the wrong way. Between it all, I took the letter down and put it inside a book because of the note, because of the cat, because Mrs. Pritchard is right about cats and paper when you are not watching. The book was one of my mother’s. A girl in the book falls in love with a man who keeps bees. She can’t eat the honey because it makes her tongue swell. I kept the letter there because the bees would keep it safe. I shouldn’t have cared where it was. I should be big enough not to care about paper. But I cared.

I didn’t see Noah at noon. I didn’t see him at three. At four I stood on the back steps with the broken railing and listened to the street and the alley and the life that lives behind the other life. The air on my arms had that hot edge that says storm even if the sky says no. I called him. Straight to voicemail that wasn’t his voice. It was a computer telling me his number like I didn’t know it by heart. I called the shop by the tracks. No answer. I called Mateo who sometimes lets Noah hang around his mother’s bodega in exchange for sweeping and for carrying boxes. He said, “He was here yesterday. He took the old fan with the broken cage.”

“He took it?” I said.

“To fix it,” Mateo said. “He says he can fix him. I told him, the fan is a him now? He says yes. He left. You coming for plantains next week? We will have too many.”

“Yes,” I said, and then I was done with words. I ran to the end of the alley because it was faster than walking but I didn’t know where to go. I ran to the tracks because if Noah were a place, he would be the place where the trains think about slowing down. A chain-link fence said: Keep Out. The gate was chained. A hole had been cut in the bottom and someone had tied it shut with twine. I untied it and went in and I didn’t think about anything except the way the stones on the ground slide under your feet and how if you fall you tear your hands on cinders and how cinders come from something that used to be alive and now is not.

There were puddles that reflected nothing except sky. There were tin cans with rainwater and mosquito larvae that made the water look like it had secrets. There was a pile of tires that has been here since I started keeping count of years. There was a white van with its back doors closed. There was no one.

“Noah?” I said, and felt stupid for calling. The trains called back. That’s what they do: they make a sound like a name that isn’t yours, and then they’re gone.

I found the notebook he carries for the stuff he remembers he needs to remember. It was under the small bridge where run-off collects and becomes a creek when it wants to be dramatic. It looked like it had been dropped and had rolled, and the last page had been torn out. The page that would have told the thing that came last. I held the notebook and it warmed up in my hand fast. Like it was someone’s pet. The cover was a picture of a bear. He buys notebooks for five cents when the stores mark them down to almost free and then he carries it until the cover is a map of his life that week. I flipped the pages. Tight notes about resistors and the price of copper by the pound. A drawing of a man with a hat he didn’t like, arrows pointing to the hat. A list of words he didn’t want to forget because he liked how they felt: fulcrum, trundle, sepia, burr. It smelled like the inside of his jacket.

I put it inside my shirt because I didn’t have a bag and it seemed like the thing I should do. I stood under the bridge and looked where the creek pretended to be a river and I did not cry. Crying is for when the thing has happened and you can’t do anything about it. I could still do something. I could walk fast. I could ask questions. I could go to the yard where the men who run the train cars play cards and spit. I could talk to anyone who had a face I could see.

When I went back through the hole in the fence, a boy was there who I had seen maybe twice before and who knew me in the way that people who live in the same place know each other even if they pretend they don’t. He had hair that refused to be arranged and a jacket with a team name on it that had been fabric-markered out.

“You shouldn’t go in there alone,” he said, not unkind. He was eating sunflower seeds and spitting the shells into a paper cup with the concentration of a surgeon.

“I’m not alone,” I said, which is something people say when they don’t want to talk about the fact that they feel like they might be alone. “Did you see my brother?”

“What’s he look like?”

“Like a boy who knows how to fix things,” I said, and his face changed, which is how I knew he knew who I meant. “He carries a blue bag with a patch with a rocket on it and has a nose that points like a sign.”

“He was here,” the boy said. “Yesterday. He was saying about how the static has messages in it. He had a radio. He was talking to the trains.”

“The trains talk back?”

“They say get out of the way,” he said, and smiled with one tooth chipped. “But he said other stuff. He was talking like he could hear a person in the static. Like an old friend. You know, when you put the dial not on a station and it becomes snow and then it’s not snow because it’s got a secret? He said he could hear someone saying his name in the weather.”

I had to swallow twice because my mouth decided it wanted to be the desert. “If you see him,” I said, “tell him to come home right now.”

“He’s not a dog,” the boy said mildly, and then, as if to give me something that was his to give, “You sing at the convenience store sometimes when you think no one is listening. You’re too loud for the chips.”

I left him there and said thank you, which came out like three separate words. Back at the house it felt like the floor had to be told what to do with my feet. Mrs. Pritchard was in the hall with her hands wrapped in dish towels like maybe she had hurt them and didn’t want to tell anyone. Her mouth was a line. “He’s late,” she said.

“I know,” I said.

“He is too old to be late,” she said, which is her theory about children: if you are old enough to vomit into a bucket by yourself, you are old enough to call and say I will miss dinner.

“We should call,” I said.

“Who?” she said, and looked at the phone like it was a fish that had washed up on our beach. “I am not his mother.”

“I am not his mother,” I said. We said it at the same time. We left a space after it like a grave that would be filled with something we didn’t mean to bury. The twins had their faces pressed to the banister. The cat was nowhere.

I called anyway. I called the number you call when a person is not where they are supposed to be. The woman who answered had a voice like ice water. She said, “He has not missed an official appointment of any kind this week,” as if that meant he was not missing. She said, “He is not a minor,” and then I had to do math and say that he was, almost, but not. She said, “Tell him to call if he wants to make himself known,” and then she said, softer, “Call back if he does not come home by morning.”

“Morning is too far,” I said.

“Sometimes it isn’t,” she said. “Sometimes morning is the only thing slow enough to catch something.”

Noah’s room is all wires. There are strings in the air. He has hooked a small wheel to the ceiling and run fishing line through it and tied bits of metal to the end and when he pulls, they chime. He wrote the words of science on the walls in pencil, not big, not where anyone could see. He put check marks next to the things he understood, nothing next to the things he pretended to. The blue bag with the rocket patch was not on its hook. The jar with the pennies and the bolts and the two screws that pretend to be screws and are actually a toy were both half-empty. His bed was made. He doesn’t make his bed unless he plans to not be in it. Mrs. Pritchard stood in the doorway and looked like someone had told her a joke with a knife in it.

“I’ll call Mr. Avery,” she said. “He sees things without meaning to.”

“Okay,” I said. “I’ll go outside again. I’ll go to Mateo. I’ll go to the railyard and sit there and I will be the person people come to when they want to tell the truth.”

“Or we could do the thing where we wait,” she said.

“I am not good at that,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “Go.”

On the porch the letter in my pocket made a shape against my thigh, a hard, flat truth. I took it out and looked at it because looking at it is a way to not look at other things. The silver starburst had scuffed at one edge. It had a line in it like it had been a sticker and then had stuck to something else and pulled off and was hastily put on again. The ink of Finalist had bled one little bit where the paper has a scar. You wouldn’t notice. You wouldn’t see unless you knew paper like I do. It still looked like certainty.

I held it in my fist until it warmed like an animal that trusted me. I put it back in the book with the bees. If I sang, the bees would hum. I did not sing. I walked. I walked until the street ended and then I walked somewhere that wasn’t a street anymore, until even the map in my head said, You sure? The city is a machine and I know its gears. Springfield hums when it wants something and goes quiet when it wants you to lean in. When the air tells you to listen, you listen.

And I did the thing I always promised myself I would not do, not ever: I asked the river for a favor. I stood on the bank where the rocks are like teeth and I said Noah’s name and then I said, “Bring him back.” The water pretended not to hear me. It does that. It has to. If it said yes to everybody, we’d all be holding hands and singing and never swallow a thing we didn’t want to. I threw a penny and a bolt into the dark and the river took both like it took everything else, like it knew how all this ends and was bored with how we never learn.

When I turned back toward the neighborhood, toward the porch with Mrs. Pritchard’s plants drooping because she waters them in a way that isn’t on the schedule the plants would prefer, I heard something that was either a door slamming or my heart stumbling in my chest. I stepped into the light under our one streetlamp. The letter shifted against my leg. The note Noah left scratched the inside of my head. Fixing something. Don’t worry. Be there later. I don’t worry. I build a house out of it and sleep inside. I stood on the top step and sang one line, just one, into the night. It didn’t answer. Or it did. It answered in a language I have not yet learned.

He did not come that night. I lay in bed and listened to every sound and turned them into him and then turned them back again when they weren’t. The train called its not-my-name, and the radiator hissed like old men in a church, and a dog cried, and a car door clicked, and somewhere, faint, a TV tried to sell one more thing that would make your life okay. The letter above my bed had a curl at the corner, a defiance. In the morning when I reached up to smooth it, the pin almost slipped, my hand shook, the word We are delighted slipped sideways in the light and looked like We are not, and for a second I said out loud to the empty room, “Don’t you dare,” and I wasn’t talking to the paper.

I was talking to whatever part of the day writes itself before you arrive.In the morning the light came in mean, the kind of gray that doesn’t want to commit to weather. It was the color of a bruise you get from something you can’t name. I made the twins’ lunches and put the red apple in the bag with the boy who won’t eat red apples and the green one in the bag with the girl who will only eat red, and I did it on purpose because I wanted the world to be perfect in one small thing and then I wanted to fix it. Mrs. Pritchard looked at the clock twice and then at me and then at the clock again like it was a person we both knew who had started telling lies. She had the phone on the counter and her hand on the phone and she wouldn’t pick it up.

“He’ll be home,” she said, and the sentence had too many edges. “He’s a boomerang.”

“Boomerangs get lost all the time,” I said. “They end up on roofs and in trees. Someone finds them and keeps them because the kind of person who finds a boomerang is the kind of person who says free.”

“He’ll be home,” she said again, and then, softer, “Mr. Avery saw a van.”

Mr. Avery is the neighbor who can see through the weather. He plants tomatoes in soil that looks like powdered brick and somehow they blush in September anyway. He says the city is a mall for birds and he is not wrong. I went to see him with my coffee still in my hand and the twins’ laughter colliding with itself in the hallway behind me like it could make armor if it tried.

He answered his door with a cat draped around his neck like a scarf that breathed. His apartment smelled like old newspaper and vinegar, a combination I associate with fryers at the end of their lives. He had on a flannel shirt with the collar worn to threads and the kind of eyes that are always ready to tell you something true and too small to hold.

“Van,” he said, before I could ask. “White. A ladder like a rib cage on top. Parked by the alley where nobody parks because the ground dips and whatever you put there rolls.”

“When?” I said.

“Yesterday,” he said, scratching the cat like he was tuning it. “After the six o’clock news lied and the weather lied quieter. Two men, maybe boys if you’re feeling mean. One with a hat I didn’t like. Not a cap. A hat with a brim that said church if church were made out of cardboard and bad intentions.”

“And Noah?” I said. My voice did a thing it doesn’t do. It tripped.

“He went by with that face he gets when he is going to marry an idea,” Mr. Avery said. “Carrying a fan with no cage and a radio with its mouth hanging open. I yelled his name and the trains yelled louder. He waved like you wave when you mean to call later and then don’t.”

“Did he get in the van?”

“No,” he said. “If he did, I would have thrown something. Probably my shoe. The cat doesn’t like me to throw him.” He shifted the cat and the cat made a sound like a sigh with a vowel in it. “They were talking into the air. One of them, the hat, he was holding a thing like a microphone but not. A hand radio. Little. Black. It chirped at him like a bird that had learned a language we don’t teach. He smiled like a man who had invented a small trap.”

“Did they see you?”

“Everyone sees me,” he said, amused. “I am bald and I live at a window. But no. They were looking at a corner of the world I couldn’t see, the way people do when they’ve decided a corner is the whole room.”

I told Mrs. Pritchard what he’d said and she chewed on it like it was a piece of meat too tough to be worth the effort. “We’ll call,” she said finally. “And they will tell us to wait. And we will not wait, and they will be angry we didn’t wait, and it will change nothing.”

We called. The woman with the ice water voice had a twin on day shift. This one had a gum-click and a keyboard that made a particular bird sound every time she pressed enter. She asked for names. She asked for last seen. She asked, finally, like she was tired of asking and wanted to go home, if he had a medical condition that would make him confused. I said, “He has being seventeen,” and she said, “That’s not in my list,” in a way that was almost kind.

She gave me a number. It was made of digits, but it felt like something you could lose under a couch. I wrote it on my hand under the blue line from the letter, and when I closed my fingers the ink made a smudge, and the smudge looked like a map that had been rained on.

Work wanted me anyway. Hanna believes in feeding the machine even when it grinds. The diner was full of men with shoulders that tell you what they’ve carried and women with hair that knows what wind does. Cole watched me put coffee on a table without the sugar and he didn’t say anything about it, which is how I knew he was worried. He whistled nothing at all. It was worse than Moon River.

“Take my break,” he said, later, and jerked his chin at the back door. “I know a guy at the yard.”

We drove in his truck that smells like stale French fries and hope. The yard guard had a beard that could smuggle small secrets. He squinted when I said Noah’s name and shrugged in a way that meant yes but he didn’t want yes to come out of his mouth in front of a clipboard.

“Kids come around,” he said. “They think trains tell them things. Train says the same things every day if you know how to listen. Get out of the way. I am going where I’m going because someone told me to.”

“What about a white van?” I said. “Hat like a bad church.”

“There was a catering van,” he said. “No ladder. Smelled like meatballs. There was also a guy with a handheld who was not mine. You can tell who belongs to a place by how their shoes hit the ground. He walked like he wrapped tape around his ankles. He talked to nobody and then somebody answered.”

“Answered where?” I said.

“In the air,” he said, and grinned with four teeth silver. “You new to radios?”

“He’s not,” I said. “He can make a lamp out of nothing.”

He nodded, as if I had told him the ending to a story he liked. “There’s an old man on Fifth who listens to everything that isn’t glued down and half the things that are. He sits there with a wire like a spider and he can tell you what time a tornado hits a town we have never been to. You go ask him. He sells watches for parts and batteries, sometimes shoes.”

That’s how I ended up in Mr. Ruiz’s store twice in one day. The bell did the bell thing like always, a ring that made my neck think there was a fly. He looked up from a box of remotes like he expected me and had been practicing his line.

“I have something for you,” he said, because he always does. He pulled a small gray radio out from under the counter like a magician who knows he should carry rabbits just in case. “Scanner. She’s old but she likes attention. No warranty. If she dies, you can cry at her funeral and I will say I told you so.”

“She,” I said, because I tell him he genders everything and he tells me I make poetry out of trash. “How do I listen to trains?”

He showed me. He showed me by making the dial stop where the air had a different shape. The numbers reflected in his glasses. He told me about codes until my head felt like a drawer with too many rubber bands in it. He said, “Airband is too high for this one, but this will give you the stuff that happens on the ground. The whistles are just for show.”

I took the scanner and it fit in my hand like something Noah would have handed me. The speaker made a thin mosquito sound like a secret that hadn’t decided to hatch. I walked back into the day with a machine and thought about all the ways the city speaks and how few we actually learn if no one tells us. At the corner, Mrs. Delaney from the laundromat told me I looked like I had been awake too long. I told her I had, but not for any of the reasons she thought were useful.

I didn’t go to Rhea because I didn’t want to sing my alphabet while my body was trying to spell missing. I went to the Memorial Arena because the word Gate C had planted itself behind my eye and wouldn’t stop flashing. It’s not far. The building sits like a ship that got tired halfway onto shore and decided to sink there anyway. The parking lot breaks into gravel at the edges and then into weeds. On non-game days the arena looks surprised to find itself without noise. I went around back, past dumpsters that smelled like domed hot dogs and sugar, to the loading dock. Gate C is a corrugated roll-up door and a person door with a handle that sighs. There was no one.

A security guard appeared the way security guards do. He had a walkie that chirped and a posture that said he had seen every version of every story and they were all potato salad at the end. His name tag said Lionel and his face said he hated his feet.

“You can’t be here,” he said, but not in a way that prevented me from being there.

“I’m here,” I said. I showed him the letter. He leaned away from the shine and then leaned in. His eyes went to the starburst. He rubbed his thumb over the paper like he wanted to see if the ink would give up and tell him where it came from.

“We get a lot of dreamers,” he said. “That door is where they come to lose something.”

“Have you seen—” I started, and then stopped, because the description I had of Noah in this place was made out of wanting, not out of facts.

“I don’t take roll,” Lionel said. “I see kids come with guitars and I tell them no guitars. I see girls with heels they can’t run in. Sometimes a crew with tripods comes and then leaves because they realize our lights don’t like their lights. Once, last week, a couple of boys leaned against the rail like they built it and tried to hear if the arena was thinking about them. I said same thing I’ll say to you. Try again when the sun is up and the office is open and the man who signs the paper is here to see you. It’s all locked now. You want to get in, you’ll have to be smaller than the space under the door.”

“Do a lot of letters look like this?” I said.

He scratched his ear under the headset and made a face like the itch had tried to bite him. “Shiny,” he said. “People love shiny. Saw three with that same little sparkle. We had to ask those kids to leave because they were filming themselves being asked to leave. They wanted the part where we said no. They wanted to be tragic on camera. They asked me to say it again with feeling.”

“Do you remember their names?”

“I barely remember mine,” he said. “Look.” He pointed. On the concrete near the door was a scuff like a moon the day after full. In the scuff, dried chalk drew a word that you would not see if you were in a hurry. Story, someone had written, with an arrow pointing at the door and then a smaller arrow pointing back at a spot where the wall meets itself. I put my hand on the wall and the wall was warm, old sun stored in concrete like an idea you can touch.

On the bus home a woman with a tattoo of a tiny knife on her finger fell asleep and dreamed herself into a laugh. A boy in a sweatshirt drew a city on the window with his fingertip and then wiped it away with his sleeve. The scanner in my pocket whispered to itself and then burst into a voice saying codes that detailed the sad ballet of a day: a shoplifter who only took gum, a fender bending itself around another fender, a man who did push-ups in the intersection until someone said Please Do Not. None of it was Noah, except that all of it was.

Back at the house Mr. Avery had put a ladder against our porch to fix a gutter that was not his and did not need fixing. He does that when he doesn’t know what else to do. He pretends the physics of water is a problem he can solve with a better angle. He squinted down at me, upside down like a bat.

“I know a man who makes the radio sit up and beg,” he said. “You come. Bring your small storm.”

His friend lived two streets over in a house that had a yard of antennae like a field of metal flowers. A long wire ran from a lightning rod to a pole anchored with rope and stubbornness. There were chimes that never chimed unless the wind took a particular interest. Inside it was clean in a way that made you think nothing had ever been cooked there. On the wall were plates with call signs, letters and numbers like a code you would need a childhood to learn. The man had hands that were the color of walnuts and a ring in his voice that meant he didn’t often get to talk to people who wanted to hear.

“I hunt foxes on Sundays,” he said, after Mr. Avery said my brother was missing and I said my heart was a mess and he said hm like a note. “Not animals. Signals. Some clown hides a transmitter in a bucket and the rest of us drive around with antennae like we’re trying to talk to Mars. It’s good for the brain. Keeps you from buying boats.”

“I need to hear what he heard,” I said. “There’s a thing they say. Gate C. Bring your story. It sounds—it sounds like an instruction you get in a dream right before you wake up and lose the end.”

He sat me down in front of a radio with a dial that looked like it could tell me the names of comets if I asked politely. He showed me how to breathe and how not to breathe. He put a pair of headphones on my ears that made the world go small and tinny until it got big again.

Static is not nothing. It’s all the things you don’t know how to hold. I turned. I turned again. I hit the places where men say their call signs with pride and women say their garden is growing and teenagers want to know if anyone can hear them because who doesn’t, and then I went past to where the noise drifts and becomes its own church. And there it was. Not a person talking. A loop, a warm little loop, a mouse running on a wheel. Check-in at oh-seven hundred, Gate C. Bring your story. No accompaniment other than what you can carry in your hand. Ferry your frequencies. The last bit came out smudged sometimes like a hand had run across it while the ink was damp.

“Pirate,” the man said, satisfied, like he had located a bird by its call and was happy that the bird still existed. “Someone’s playing on our playground without permission. Not a lot of power. Local. We can find it.”

We went outside where the air felt like tin. He handed me an antenna shaped like a little rake and I thought about going into a garden and scraping up a seed. Mr. Avery held the receiver like a baby he didn’t want to drop. We turned like the hands of a clock until the sound swelled and then receded, like a tide that had lost its schedule. Every few feet the man would stop and write something on a piece of paper that had a grid printed on it, as if the city were a board game and we were cheating.

The place was just off the river because of course it was. Not the arena after all. The old Springfield Library sat with its mouth shut. Brick that had been brick for too long was flaking into small red laughs. We had to go down a set of stairs that smelled like mold and student fear. The door had a chain on it that said the city cared enough to put a chain on it and no more. There is a way to not break a chain but convince it to stop participating. The radio man knew that way.

Inside was the basement I had described to Noah even though I had been afraid to describe it to myself. Folding chairs. A platform with a carpet that had never been new. A banner that had once said something about reading turned backward and hung like a trapeze for a performer who would never show up. On a table, a box with a battery and a small radio and a loop of wire, alligator clips like little mouths smiling their metal smiles. The loop took my frequency and choked it into shape. The recorded voice came from a device that was not expensive and not new. I wound the loop around my wrist. It was warm and then it was not.

There were papers. There are always papers. A list of questions written in a font that wanted to be your friend. Tell us about your childhood. Tell us about a time you were broken. What is the thing you regret. Who do you sing for. Who would be proud of you if they were still here. At the bottom, a printed line: Be prepared to tell it in the hallway, to camera, to the host, to your mother, to yourself. Someone had written over the last sentence in ballpoint: This is not a test. Someone else, maybe the same, had scrawled: It is, though.

On a chair I found a penny and a bolt, and because I am not a fool, I know when the world is talking to me even if it has to use the simplest words. I picked them up and the bolt was the right size for the threads of the fan Mateo had said Noah carried. It felt like the world had placed a coin in my mouth and told me to pay a toll.

“He was here,” I said, or I meant to say it. My throat had turned to bread.

“You’re not the only one,” Mr. Avery said, quiet. He showed me footprints in dust like bent commas. Even dust says something if you let it. “Lots of feet. The ones that belong to your brother have more small pebbles in them because his shoes have holes. You should make him let you take him to the free store. He will say he is fine.”

He was here. He is not here now. The radio man squatted by the battery and shook his head like the gall of it offended him. “This is small-time,” he said. “It’s a fish on a stringer. They cast it, they catch what they catch, they haul it to their cooler and move. Nobody sits in the same water twice.”

“Why?” I said. It came out the way a child says it, the hand on the edge of the table where the candy sits. “Why would anybody do this. Why would you—why.”

“Because stories are currency,” Mr. Avery said. “Because if you can make someone hand you their heart, you can make them hand you other things. Because everyone thinks their door opens somewhere else and there is always someone who would sell you a knob.”

The radio man patted the loop. “I can follow the next voice,” he said. “If they light it again, I will know. I will call you. Write your number where I won’t lose it. Write it twice.”

Back home my room felt too small for the beat of my blood. The letter on the wall had a bruise where the pin had been taking a breath. I pulled it down and turned it over because sometimes the back of a thing holds the version of the truth it thinks it can hide. There was nothing on the back, and then, when I turned it back again and tilted it in the window light, I saw the nothings that aren’t nothing. Indentations are the ghosts of words. He had written on top of the letter, or on another piece of paper with the letter underneath, and the pen had pressed hard enough to leave marks. I went for a pencil. I shaded like a child trying to make a treasure map appear.

Numbers came up like bones. Not a lot. Not clean. Pieces of pieces. 146.5— and then the end smudged where I had touched it with the soft part of my hand. O—700. And then a word that could be roof or root or room depending on how much you wanted it to be any of those. There was also a small drawing of a ladder that was just lines and a rectangle that could be a van or a door or the idea of something you walk through.

I took the scanner to the roof even though the building doesn’t like people on its back. The shingles scratch too easy, and Mrs. Pritchard says roofs are for crows and the men who think they can fix what time makes. I climbed out the bathroom window anyway and sat with my knees up and the city throwing its noise at me like confetti you didn’t ask for. I tuned to 146.52 and I listened. Someone said they were on their way to the store for ice. Someone said copy that to no one. Someone said a call sign with pride, and then the little loop voice popped its mouth at me again from somewhere else, lower, a fish clapping its fins. I wanted to put my own voice in the air so hard my teeth hurt.

I thought about Rhea and the alphabet and the door. I thought about the first time Noah took apart a thing just to see how it worked and put it back together not the same and somehow better. He did it to a clock when we were thirteen and fifteen and the clock gave up telling the right time but started telling us when we were late. He did it to a toaster and the toaster began to draw on bread. He did it to me once, carefully, when he said, You sing like you’re apologizing to air. And I grew a different set of lungs.

The twins came into my room, uninvited as always, and sat on the floor and braided ribbon into a rope that would probably break when you put your weight on it. They didn’t ask about Noah because asking about him would make it a thing, would make the shape of the worry fill up the room they used for games. One of them, the girl, who has a way about her of saying true things when she thinks she is being normal, said, “When the man on TV asks you your story, you should say, It doesn’t belong to you.”

I lay down on the rug and put the scanner on my chest and the hum made my bones decide they were instruments. For a second I thought about my mother’s book and the bees and the way the girl in the book can’t eat what she loves. I took the letter out of the book and held it above my face and the starburst winked at me like we were in on a joke we had never shared.

I made a list of what I would say if the man asked me to bring my story like it was a casserole. I wrote, My stepmother bent the day into shapes that fit into her drawers. I wrote, My name is light and I live in a house where bulbs burn out. I wrote, I have made myself small and then larger and both felt like a lie. I wrote, I want to sing so loud the river mistakes me for thunder. I scratched it all out. I tried again. This time I wrote one line that I didn’t hate. The line said: I am not the thing that happened to me. I folded the paper around itself and put it under the letter’s pin, a paper under a paper, a small promise trying to borrow weight from a bigger lie.

Late, after the twins were collected and put into beds like promises we meant to keep, after the dishes were done and Mrs. Pritchard had stood in the doorway of Noah’s room long enough to memorize the kind of nothing that was there, I took the scanner and Mr. Ruiz’s loaner battery pack and went back to the library. It is not a safe plan to go places at night with something that looks like it can talk to satellites. I did it anyway. The city at my ankles felt like a dog that might bite if you moved too fast.

The loop didn’t play, but other sounds did. A voice like a hand on your shoulder. A tone that came every thirty seconds and made my stomach pretend. I went down the stairs and the metal gate we had asked to stop participating was participating again, with a new lock this time that looked like a fist. In the gap between the door and the doorframe someone had slid a piece of paper. I put my fingers on it because I have never been good at letting something wait.

It was another letter. Not to me. To a girl named Marnie whose last name I recognized from Hanna’s list of kids who sometimes come to the diner and eat soup for too long. The same shine. The same star. The same words. Same date. Same Gate. On the back someone had written a number, maybe hers, maybe the person who had given it to her. Under that, a circle, not a zero, just a circle, like the kind a judge holds up when they are thinking about the sun.

I went to the diner’s alley the next morning before my shift and found Marnie smoking with the pocketed shoulders of someone who has been caught and made catching her into a joke. Her hair was scalp-close and her eyes were the color of green bottles you find half-buried at the river’s edge.

“I didn’t think they picked people like us,” she said, when I asked about the letter and showed her I had one too. “I thought you had to be somebody or have a dress that cost too much or the kind of teeth you can see from space.”

“They pick whatever makes a sound,” I said. “They pick the things that reflect.”

“Is it real?” she said, and she wasn’t asking if the show existed. She was asking if the thing it promised was a true thing. I wanted to give her the answer that would take the weight out of her posture.

“It’s a door,” I said. “I don’t know where it goes.”

She laughed in a way that hurt me. “All doors go to the same place,” she said. “They go to what you brought with you.”

Hanna opened the back door with her hip and banged it against the dumpster and shouted at both of us to either come in and slice tomatoes or stand out there and be poets but don’t do both because doing both gets blood in the soup. Inside Cole held up a radio magazine with a picture of an antenna shaped like a bird skeleton.

“You fox hunt now?” he said. “Can I come next time? I’ll bring snacks and whistle the right key so the signal comes in strong.”

“We found something,” I said, and he didn’t ask what because he could see that if he did, the thing would be too big to sit on the counter with the pie.

On my break I called the number on the back of Marnie’s letter. A woman answered with a voice that had grates in it. I could hear a train, or a TV, or a train on a TV in her background. She said, “Yes,” like she had been saying yes all morning and hated each one.

“Did you get one of these?” I said, and told her what one was.

“My niece,” she said. “She opened it and nearly dropped her world. She got up at four to make sure her voice was awake and then she went to the part of town where the birds don’t like the light. I told her, do not go with anyone whose boots match. She said I was always dramatic. She left a note that said Gate C like that means anything. If this is a trick I will eat the person who made it up.”

“When?” I asked.

“This morning,” she said. “She had a small bag and her song and her face. I would have gone with her but my boss thinks he counts what I do with my day. She texted me at six something. You there, she wrote. I wrote, Always, and then I made coffee for a man who told me I was too slow. She hasn’t texted me since.”

I held the phone against my ear until I could hear nothing but my own blood. I hung up and went into the walk-in and leaned against the boxes of lettuce and prayed to the god of refrigeration that makes no promises and keeps them. Then I did the thing that people do in movies and real life both: I put all the pieces on a table in my head and tried to connect them with string that wasn’t string.

There was the letter with its shine. There was the call about story. There was the voice on the loop. There was the van. There was the hat. There was Noah’s drawing of a ladder. There was the place where the loop lives. There was the bolt and the penny. There were the kids with their feet in the dust. There was the chalk that said story next to a door that doesn’t open unless you bend it wrong. There was the arena and Lionel’s tired no. There was the fact of me and my voice and my need and how the world can smell that like a dog smells fear and cotton candy both.

After my shift I went to Rhea because if you don’t go to the places where the people who know how to look at you live, you forget the shape of your own face. She opened the door with a bobby pin in her mouth and a rubber band making a mark on her wrist where it had lived too long.

“You didn’t come yesterday,” she said, as if she had lived a dozen yesterdays since then.

“Noah is missing,” I said. It was the first time I said it like that to her, and saying it made the word missing sit in the room like a chair someone left and nobody wants to claim. She put down the pin and looked at me hard enough to make me sit on the floor without being told. I told her everything. I told her in one long sentence that didn’t have enough air in it. She let it sit. She looked away only when I said Marnie and the number and then she looked back like she is a magnet and my face is a key.

“The story isn’t yours once you hand it to them,” she said when I was done, her voice low. “That’s the trick. They take it and make it cheaper and then sell it back to you for more. But listen. We still tell. We tell to make doors between us. Not stages. Doors. If they made a stage and called it a door, we will drag the stage to where the door should be.”

“How,” I said, and even to my own ear I sounded like a child again.

“With your mouth,” she said. “With your feet. With the part of your brain that will decide a pattern is a pattern even if it’s not. Your brother went toward a sound because he thought he could make it make sense. You go toward him because you can make too much sense out of anything and sometimes that’s useful.”

She made me sing. She made me sing because she is cruel in the way you need someone to be when the world is being cruel anyway. I sang and I hated her until I didn’t, which is how love works, sometimes. She smacked my shoulder when I did the coin-in-the-throat thing and she smiled at me with a sorrow I did not understand when I didn’t. When I was done she put both hands on my face like she was going to push it into shape.

“You can do both,” she said. “You can look for him and make the thing you said you were going to make. They are not the same door but they are on the same wall. Do not imagine that failure is how you love him. You don’t have to sink to prove you care.”

On the way out I passed the salon owner in the stairwell. She was sniffing the air like she could smell the singing. She said, “Tell your boy he left a fan in the back last week. It’s missing a bolt. It whistles like a ghost when I turn it on.”

“He’ll come get it,” I said, and if I said it wrong, the wall did not call me a liar.

That night, the radio man called. His voice came through like a photograph of a voice. “They lit it again,” he said. “Not the same place. North. Past the bridge. You want to chase?”

“I do,” I said, and my mouth remembered how to smile just for one half of itself.

We went. Mr. Avery insisted on coming with his ladder because he says ladders confuse trouble. We drove where the map in my head gave up and then pretended it hadn’t. The scanner sang its stunted song. In an industrial park that grew up out of nowhere like mushrooms after rain, we found a warehouse with one door propped with a brick. Inside, the same chairs, different dust. A ladder leaned against a wall under a hatch that was open just enough to let light tell you there was another world up there. The loop talked itself hoarse in a corner and then stopped as if we had embarrassed it by walking in on it.

On the floor were scraps of paper like someone had left a snow of memory. Questions again. Words crossed out. Names. Marnie’s among them. Noah’s not, because he would not write his name on a test he hadn’t read through. There was a line someone had scrawled across the bottom of a page, a hand arguing with itself. I copied it because I didn’t trust my eyes to keep it. It said: If you tell them the worst thing that happened, what do you do next. Underneath, smaller: Make another worst thing.

On the chair closest to the ladder was a blue thread that used to be a strap. I put it in my pocket because pockets are the only thing that make you feel like you could carry enough. We climbed the ladder because we are fools. Up top was a roof with gravel and a view of the river’s back. There were footprints of men and one set small like mine and one like someone ran but tried to make it look like a walk. At the edge there was a scuff where someone had said no and someone else had said yes.

“Either he went down the ladder,” Mr. Avery said gently, “or he wanted to go where there wasn’t one.”

“He would not jump,” I said, angry that he had even let the idea sneak out of his mouth. Angry because it had already been thinking in the back of my head. Angry because when you love someone you get angry at everyone, yourself first.

“He would not,” he said. “But he might have believed a person who promised him there was a stairway in the dark.”

We stood up there until the sun decided to play its last game with the buildings. The radio man did what radio men do. He took bearings and notes and a breath that tasted like rain if rain ever came all the way down. He said, “They won’t stay with this frequency now we came. They’ll change. But people are lazy in their clever. They’ll make a pattern without meaning to. We’ll find it.”

I went home with the loop of the recorded voice living behind my teeth. Bring your story. Bring your original song. No accompaniment other than what you can carry in your hand. Be prepared to tell it. I made dinner, which was noodles and butter and the idea of vegetables, and Mrs. Pritchard salt-and-peppered the table like it had been misbehaving. The twins argued about whether a dragon would prefer to live in the attic or under the porch. The cat appeared as a fact and a warning. When the phone rang, we all flinched, even the house.

It was the ice water voice again, the night version. “We have no updates,” she said, and the sentence was a flat stone. “Call in the morning,” she said, and this time it sounded like prayer.

After I hung up, the house breathed like it was a thing with lungs. I went to my room and the letter glared even with half of it in shadow. I took it down and put it on the floor and sat across from it the way you sit across from someone you want to understand. I told it my story. Not the version I would give to a man with a square jaw and a suit with no memories in it. The version where we are in a car that is not ours and we are driving to a building that is not a home and we are both counting the utility poles because counting makes the road shorter. The version where my father marries a woman who saves my life by not being mean and then dies before she can show me how to keep it. The version where a social worker with cracked hands says to a judge whose eyes are hewn out of wood, They have made a family out of what they found, and the judge says, Fine, and I don’t cut myself on the word. I told the letter how Noah says my name when he is trying to save me from myself and it comes out like a chord, and how the river and I have an agreement that we pretend not to know each other so the town doesn’t ask us for favors. I told the letter about the bolt and the penny and the ladder and the man with the hat and my neighbor who waters dirt into tomatoes. I talked until the house fell asleep. The letter did not answer, and then it did. It answered by staying heavy in my hand when I lifted it, by not slipping, by not pretending to be anything but a piece of paper that had started something it could not finish.

In bed I held the scanner and tuned past the loop and the brag and the hello. On a channel I did not mean to stop on, a voice came through so soft I thought it might be inside me. It said a name that is not Noah’s but that Noah uses when he thinks about being the kind of person who is only a first name, a person you are supposed to know without asking. Then it said, almost a laugh, almost a cry, “Roof.”

I sat up so fast the room pulled away from me. I said his name to the radio like it was a door. I said, “Tell me where,” and the static curled in like a cat in a box and turned its back. I felt the bruise in my throat I had made the night before when I landed the note I had stolen from a bird. I put my hand over it like you do when you say a vow to yourself because the world is busy. I said out loud to whatever is in charge of the shape of our days, “I am not looking away.”

In the morning, the river had moved and my world had not. The phone had not learned any new words in the night. Mrs. Pritchard held a cup that said INTERESTING and stared at it like it might surprise her by keeping its promise. The twins left for school with their shoes on the wrong feet and defiance in their spines and they would fix one of those things before the corner. I took the letter and tucked it into the book with the bees and the bees hummed, just enough to make the page shiver.

I went back to the library. I went back to the warehouse. I went under the bridge where the creek pretends and then fails at pretending. I went to the park and stood on the bandstand and sang one verse for the good ghosts and one for the bad. I called the number on Marnie’s letter again and said into the answering machine that caught me, “He is not yours. None of us are. Send him back. Send them all back. We will make our own stories. We will carry them with our own hands.”

Then I went to the arena because I do not know how to stop going to the place that is a door even if it’s a lie. Lionel looked at me and I looked at him and neither of us said no. In the shadow of Gate C, someone had taped up a sheet of paper that was not official and not careful and not long for this world. It said, in thick marker that had bled into itself, Check-in moved to the Riverside Expo, Gate E. Show up early. Bring your story. Underneath someone had written, small, in a hand I would know under water, Roof.

I didn’t breathe for a count I could not count. Then I breathed. Then I ran, which is singing with different muscles. The Expo is a mile and change along a road that roars. I ran until my breath made a sound that scared a dog. I ran until Mrs. Delaney’s laundromat disappeared in my rear view and the wall where teenagers write declarations about love and how long it’s going to last was a paragraph that hurt my eyes. When I got there the sun was doing its best and the building was pretending to be important. Gate E was glass and metal and a sign that said nothing you need.

A line had formed. Kids. Grown-ups who are still kids. Two men with clipboards and smiles that had been rehearsed. A woman with a camera that made a small, polite throat-clearing when it turned on. They were collecting letters and stories and faces. They were hungry and their hunger had a schedule.

I slowed. I did not stop. I walked to the end of the line like it had been made for me. I put the letter in my pocket instead of my hand. I held the scanner like a wallet. I looked at the roof because the word had told me to, because the shape of the world had narrowed to a place where air meets edge.

There is a door up there, I thought, and maybe there is not a door, only sky. I thought of ladders and men who don’t like hats and hats that don’t like men. I thought of Noah, and his bag with the rocket patch, and the sound in the radio that said a name only he uses. I thought of the way a song leaves you and belongs to the room and comes back if the room is in the mood. I thought, I am in the mood to take back everything. And then the line moved and I moved with it because there are some kinds of bravery you have to do when you are already doing them or you never will.Chapter 5

The line at Gate E moved like a centipede that had decided to be patient. People wore their hope on the outside where I could see it even if they thought they’d tucked it in their pockets. A girl with hair the color of soda can tabs held her guitar sideways, angling the case so the clipboard man wouldn’t see, even though the sign behind him said in polite letters what the letter had said in small unkind ones. Parents tried to fold themselves into neutral expressions and failed. The camera made a polite cough when it woke up, the red light on its temple opening like a small eye. I kept my letter in my pocket and my hand on the scanner the way other people keep a rosary. The building smelled like new carpet over old popcorn, a scent that tells the truth about how many times a room has pretended to be something bigger than itself.

Marnie was three humans ahead of me, shoulders high, neck a column. She didn’t turn around but she adjusted her stance the way you do when you know someone you know is behind you and you want that to be true without telling the world. The clipboard man had a mouth like a ruler. He told each person the same words and then the same new words if the first ones didn’t take. Fill this, he said. Sign here, he said. Circle yes if you consent to being filmed and rebroadcast in perpetuity, the heaviest word stapled to the lightest. Tell us about your journey, he said, and he let the word do all the lifting. He was flanked by a woman in a scarf that looked expensive and looked exactly like every other scarf people wear when they want to look expensive without scaring you. She held a stack of waivers that had more small print than kindness. Do you agree to allow, do you understand that, do you waive forever the right to object if your story is altered to fit time constraints and narrative shape. The pen she handed out was the kind you give away in offices that have glass bowls of candy for people who don’t like their jobs.

“Leda,” a voice said like it was testing the sound. I didn’t look for it with my eyes. I felt it arc through the scanner, tinny as a memory of thunder. Roof, it said, and the word was softer this time, like it was tired or afraid it would be overheard. I let the line carry me one human forward and then one more. The door to the left of Gate E had a sign over it that said Service, and a smaller sign that said Staff, and a smaller still sign with a picture of a cigarette inside a circle with a slash. The bottom edge of it had been worried up by hands. I glanced at Marnie and she gave me a look that contained an entire paragraph. Her eyes slid to the camera and then back. She bent to tie her shoe and took a long time with the knot. She stood and began to sing, loud enough for the red light to blink at her like it had found dessert. It was not a song that belonged to the situation. It was an old camp thing about a moose and a muffin, a choice so cheerfully wrong the clipboard man had to look up and ask if she had something else and the camerawoman had to get closer because any wrong thing is a right thing if you point a lens at it long enough. Marnie leaned forward into the mic the way she knows you should and blew gently into it like she was cooling soup and then laughed at herself and it was almost pretty.

I slipped left, through the door with the signs, into air that had the damp sweetness of machine breath. A corridor stretched in beige and metal, lined with electrical boxes that muttered to themselves and doors that did not have plans for me. A freckle of light made a wedge under a door near the end of the hall and on that door a paper sign had been taped up with ambition: Rooftop Terrace, Staff Only. Terrace made it sound like people drank wine there and talked about investments. The door was propped with a bucket turned upside down and filled with bolts like kibbles for a machine. I let my scanner hum and it hummed back, pleased to be in a place where air had corners.

Stairs know when you are in a hurry and they decide to see if they can teach you humility. I climbed anyway. Each landing had a square of window that let the river in, slice by slice, a strip of light like a ribbon wrapped around a package too large to open properly. At the top, a door with a bar gave when I leaned and the roof came on like a trick, suddenly under me, acres of tar and gravel and metal teeth gnashing quietly under air that felt like pennies. The skyline made promises to people who wanted to hear them. A roll of black cable lay like a snake near the edge, and beyond it a low railing ran grudgingly along the drop.

They had set it up here, too. A milk crate with a battery and a cheap loop of wire that made my scanner think about kneeling. The little radio blinked with an eye that was willing to work for anyone. A tripod pointed at the city’s face like it was trying to catch it uncomposed. Tape on the tar made a box with the word MARK scrawled inside it, and another that said HOST in handwriting I recognized from the basement—a round c that tried to be kind and failed. The chair was not here, but you could see where chair legs had pressed into the tar and left four brief lives. Along the parapet a strip of chalk had left itself like a trail someone meant to erase. Story, it said, and then an arrow toward the sky, which is my least favorite door because it insists it belongs to everyone.

I crouched by the crate. Someone had cut the loop sloppy and twisted the ends together with a piece of wire that would rather not be bothered. The battery had a sticker from a store that had closed last winter even though it was always full. The loop whispered to itself anyway and I let it tell me what it knew. Check-in at oh-seven hundred, Gate C, bring your story, bring your original song, ferry your frequencies. The last line had shifted, a new voice hitchhiking on the old one. It said, softer, almost regret in it, Roof again. Then quiet.

By the tripod lay a blue thread. It could have been anybody’s blue, but it was the exact shade of Noah’s bag when the sun remembers its responsibilities. There was also a bolt, not the same as the one I had given the river, a different size and a different thread, with a smear of grease that smelled like Mateo’s hands at the end of a day. I held it in my palm and it painted my lines darker. I wanted to put it somewhere where it could mean something more than itself and there is no such place, so I put it in my pocket.

I heard the door before I saw the hat. The door spoke the language of metal, complained about being asked to work, and then it opened and let through a man who dressed his bad thoughts as nice ones. The hat cast a square of shade on his eyes and made his mouth look like it was trying to remember a joke. He had a handheld clipped to his belt that chirped when it got bored. He could have been any age between too old to know better and too young to care. He walked like someone had threaded tape around his ankles and pulled when he wanted to go too fast.

“You’re not Staff,” he said pleasantly, as if he were relieved to finally find a person to say a sentence to. He smiled like white gravel. “But you move like you have purpose, so I’ll allow it.”

“I’m getting my light levels,” I said, and I rested my forearms on the tripod like we were old together. “You want the skyline or the water?”

“Both, if you can’t help it,” he said. He strolled closer and his radio chirped twice and then went quiet. “Which one are you? Don’t tell me. I like to guess. You look like a Sarah but you don’t like to be called Sarah. You use a nickname so people will think they know you and that makes you safe.”

“Leda,” I said, because I have learned that sometimes the truth is a thicker wall than a lie. “You tried Gate C. You tried a library. You’re trying this new one because the sky makes people think what they’re doing is bigger than it is.”

“Bigger is relative,” he said, and I could see him deciding how much of me he thought would be useful. He moved his hand like a magician about to choose a coin. “We give kids a shot. That’s the point. We make a show out of it so the people who pay attention will pay attention. The thing people love more than talent is suffering. We don’t make the rules, we just make the schedule.”

“Where is my brother?” I asked, and I let the word brother ring. He tilted his head like a bird in a parking lot.

“Boys get bored,” he said. “They see wires and they go toward them. They lean over things. They like ladders. He’s around.”

“You put your rope across a city and you wait to see who trips,” I said. “You take their stories and you string them like lights and then you don’t pay the bill.”

He put both hands up like he was being held up by an old movie. “We provide opportunity,” he said. “We help them shape. You think the man with the white teeth on TV cares about whether you breathe from your belly or your throat? He wants your grandmother crying in a cutaway and the word resilience in a lower third. We help you get what you can from that. It’s not a crime to understand the machine that eats you.”

“Did he understand the machine,” I said, and I could feel the singing part of my throat gather itself the way it does when words aren’t enough. “Did he like your ladder.”

“He liked being needed,” the man said, and there was a pinch there that might have been regret or heartburn. He nodded toward the far corner of the roof, where a low structure housed a fan that made the building breathe. “He helped me fix a thing. He said your name while he did it and he said it like a song he didn’t think he was singing and then he said he had to go because you were going to make trouble.”

My mouth had already decided what it was going to do. I took a breath the way Rhea tells me to, where the bottom of my lungs goes farther down than seems possible, and I sang one line, the not-bridge from my river song, the one that is supposed to come later and only when invited. It lifted and hung and curved against the roof’s edge and then dropped like a small, bright stone, and below, the line at Gate E turned its collective face up. The camerawoman swung the lens like a sunflower. The clipboard man squinted. Marnie’s head tilted, the way people look at a bird they want to be brave enough to feed.

“What’s the plan,” the man in the hat asked, amiable like a tide is amiable. “Call attention? Shame the hand? We’ll go down the other stairs and be at the van before anyone decides to be righteous. You will have sung into the wind and the wind will have done what it does.”

“I plan to be specific,” I said, and sang another line, this time a word, not a note. Help. It is not a word you can disguise with melody if you mean it. It finds the bone of whatever you’re standing on and turns it into an instrument. The word shuddered through the roof. The camera below caught it like it was taught to catch it. People in the line took their hands off their own problems long enough to lift them to their foreheads to shade their eyes. And Lionel the security guard, who had made his peace with being required to say no to dreams for a living, walked out from behind his boredom like someone had finally called his name correctly.

The man in the hat didn’t get flustered. He doesn’t carry that gear. He reached for the tripod with one hand and the handheld with the other. I moved faster, not because I am fast but because my body knows what a stage weighs and how to put a shoulder against it. We wrestled something ungainly and he laughed, not unkind, which put a sick little heat in my chest. His radio chirped and made a word into not a word and in that half-syllable I heard another voice, the same threadbare voice that had been riding the loop, saying roof one more time and then saying, quieter, room. The shift of a vowel is a whole street.

I twisted the tripod and he let the radio fall because he wanted to keep his face. It hit the tar and made a sound like a plastic plate that had bigger dreams. I put my foot on it because sometimes being inelegant is the correct choice. The door behind us opened again and the air brought a piece of Marnie with it. She came like a person who had already decided that flying was an option even if the physics had not yet agreed. She had a look on her face that reminded me of the cat when it sees a moth and remembers that some things can still be chased.

“Do you want to be on camera while you take my friend’s voice,” she said to the hat, with politeness dense as lead. “Do you want to explain your release form to a lot of people who will listen with their rage.”

He smiled bigger because people like him are taught to smile bigger when the floor shifts. “We’re making a show,” he said, and gestured with his empty hand like presentation was an answer. “We are a pop-up. Like a food truck. The city loves us. We get permits, we pay a fee, we move along.”

“You use the word permit the way a person uses the word love when they want something for free,” Marnie said, and it made me want to hold her hand in a church and then throw rocks at something.

Lionel appeared in the doorway with two other guards and a look that said he was about to do his job and he would prefer if his job were less imaginative. “Everybody down,” he said, and then, to me, “Especially you.” He put a hand on the man in the hat like he was asking a favor with his palm instead of his voice. The hat tipped. The man tried to make a joke and Lionel didn’t let him. He took the handheld off the tar and handed it to me without comment, a kindness that would accumulate interest.

We went down the stairs like rain and the line at Gate E had turned into a circle, which is what happens when humans are handed a story and told they are allowed to witness. The scarf woman with the waivers had stopped trying to hand them out and had started folding each one in half as if the crease could turn it into something else. The camerawoman had her viewfinder up but her eye was not in it. The clipboard man tried to find the part of his mouth that says we are in control and it was not there. A girl who might have been twelve or might have been twenty-six depending on how careful you were being had a letter in her hand that was creased like she had used it as a tissue. She pressed it flat against her thigh without knowing she was doing it. Someone in line asked me if this was still the final. I said, “It is a final,” and their face did the thing faces do when they cannot reshelve a sentence.

The handheld radio on my palm made a small clearing-its-throat and then gave me a voice that had not meant to be public. “Load the white,” it said, and the word van was implied the way water is implied when you say river. “Gate F. Go where trucks sleep.” Another voice said something about batteries and a third laughed at a joke I was not told. None of them said Noah’s name. None of them said any names. You don’t say names if you can help it, not if you want your story to be one that can slither out of a net.

“Are we arresting anyone,” the younger guard asked Lionel, hopeful like a first day. Lionel sighed without letting the sigh touch his heart.

“We are escorting,” he said. “We are prioritizing safety. We are not making paperwork unless the paperwork insists.” He looked at me and at Marnie and at the hat who was suddenly hatless because someone, not me, had taken it and put it on the camera so everyone could film the part where it looked foolish. “You,” he said, not unkind. “Don’t run. I don’t want to write in my report that I watched you trip over the idea of justice.”

“What about the roof,” I said, because my mouth was a pendulum that had swung in that direction and was reluctant to swing back. “Or the room. He said room. He said it twice with his voice and once with chalk.”

Lionel scratched his ear with one finger under his headset like it itched when I said the word room. “Under the arena are rooms you don’t want to know about,” he said. “Under this one, probably a ballroom someone had a prom in and regretted later. You want down, you need someone who knows all the ways down. That is not me. That is the guy with the keys and a salary bigger than mine and less sense.” He eyed the man without his hat. “And it is sometimes these fellows who do not respect the concept of Down being for Staff.”

Marnie was already moving. She had the waiver she had been given and she was reading it out loud in a voice you use to shame your own past, and the words made the small circle into a bigger one. People said things like That Can’t Be Legal, and the scarf woman said things like It Is If You Sign, and the camerawoman kept her eye on us while the red light kept blinking because it had no moral compass, only electricity.

I slipped left again, to where the service corridor ran quiet as a hand under a door. The handheld had a dial that was a little too loose and a little too satisfied with itself. I turned it until the voices fattened, then thinned, then fattened again. “Gate F,” a woman’s voice said now, a voice with sand in it. “Keep the kit low. Park by the generators. If somebody asks, say you’re with Catering. Smile like you’re supposed to be alive.” Then, softer, like she didn’t know she had pressed the thing that makes you public, “If he comes back, don’t let the kid onto the rail. He thinks the roof is a room. He will try to open it.”

Gate F was around the side where the building had given up and become loading docks and stacked pallets and a smell that was part grease and part old ice. There were two vans and one of them was white with a ladder on its back like ribs. I didn’t run because Lionel asked me not to and because running is like singing and you save it for when it matters. I walked with intention and the handheld made a small meow. The back door of the white van was open and inside there were things that look like other things until you learn to see them. Tripods that look like crutches. A box of cables that look like noodles. A light that looks like the sun but costs less. On the floor of the van there was a sticker for a pizza place that burns everything. On the seat there was a paper with a list of places you could tape a sign to make it look like the sign belonged there. Beside the van, a kid no older than Noah brushed chalk dust off his palms and looked at me like he wanted me to be his mother and his enemy both.

“Where are you going next,” I asked, softly like the way you talk to birds you want to convince are wild. “Where did you go last. If I follow your chalk and your loop and your ladder, do I find the end of the thing or just the next beginning.”

He sucked his teeth. “It’s a job,” he said. “They pay cash. My cousin said not to because he doesn’t like the man with the hat but he doesn’t pay my rent. We go where there’s a skyline. Sometimes we go under bridges because the sound is good. We go where kids won’t get scared until you ask them to be alone. We don’t touch. We don’t keep. We film and we go.”

“Do you keep names,” I said. “Do you keep bolts. Do you keep boys who fix your fans.”

He scratched his wrist and left a line the color of a thought on his skin. He looked at the ladder and then at my face and then at his shoes. “If a kid is useful we say we’ll see him again,” he said. “If a kid is loud we put his clip first. The man with the hat thinks he can make a show and sell it before anyone asks where the show came from. He’s got a woman who knows how to talk like a license. He’s got a friend with keys.”

“What’s his name,” I said, and he laughed because the answer to that question is always Please Don’t Make Me Lie.

“Name is not on the invoice,” he said, and he closed the door of the van with a small apology for closing the door and slunk toward the generator with the mutter. The woman with the sand voice materialized at the edge of my vision and put herself between me and the van like a thin door you can see through but still have to open.

“Don’t mistake me for him,” she said. “I have needed things too. I have never pushed a child off a roof. I don’t work with people who do. If the kid went up there, he went because he could see farther from up there and he liked that more than the part where you still have to come down.”

“What room,” I said, because the word was a splinter I could not leave in my finger.

She blinked. “They put a name on anything,” she said. “Sometimes they call it the Green Room when it’s just a hallway with a chair and a cup of water that tastes like paper. Sometimes they call it the Atrium when it’s a space nobody sweeps. On the plan it’s Room 6B. In the story it’s where you wait before you have to perform your trauma. It’s under, usually. There’s a way down.”

Marnie had followed the air and found us. She stood with the kind of set to her jaw that you get when you have been told no too many times and you have started to collect the nos like coins. She held up one of the waivers and you could see the way the ink had bled into the paper’s fibers as if even the letters were trying to run. She had taken someone’s marker and written across the top: THIS IS NOT A DOOR. People had begun to come around the corner because a circle wants to be a scene. The camerawoman had not stopped filming and some part of me loved her for it.

The man without his hat slid by like water with opinions. He spoke to the sand-voiced woman without his lips moving. She did not look at him. Lionel did. He put his hand on the man’s arm and did not press, and the man found himself leaning against a different kind of no. The handheld in my palm popped, and a new voice, one I could have found in a snowstorm without eyes, came through in a thread. It was my brother doing the thing he does when he is trying to make a radio into a friend. He said, not to anyone and not to me and somehow to both, “If you go down the hallway with the map of fire, the last door on the left doesn’t lock.”

I don’t believe in magic. I believe in evidence making a shape and in the way the body will try to turn luck into a habit so it has something to hang onto. I believed him. I believed him because his voice had the small smile in it he gets when he has solved something mechanical in a way the manual didn’t say. I looked at Lionel and at the woman and at the door with the sign that said Staff and at the end of the corridor where the red rectangle of an exit plan glowed like it might have a soul.

“Okay,” Lionel said, to nobody and to me. “This is where I earn my afternoon.” He put his radio to his mouth and said a number that made somebody somewhere hold a door open longer than they meant to. He gestured with his chin. I wish I could say I walked calm into the beige and the metal, but my heart had already gone on ahead like a foolish dog and I had to catch up to it. The handheld was warm. The service corridor walls had a texture like half-forgotten dreams. The door to the stairwell had a sticker that said No Food Beyond This Point and that thing in me that is a brat said Ha and thought about singing at it.

The map of fire was just inside, a rectangle of red and white that had a little green man that thought he was fast and black arrows that thought they knew more than they did. I counted lefts and the last one was one that did not match the paint of the others, a door the color of teeth that had drunk too much coffee. It had a metal hasp for a padlock and no padlock because someone goes in and out more often than they want to tell me about. I put my hand on the handle and it surprised me by being thoughtful. It pressed against my palm like the palm was always what it had been meant for and the latch went down like a sigh relieved to have done what it is built to do.

Inside, the room let itself be called a room because it was easier than explaining that it had been a closet once and then an office and then a safe house for mops. The floor was tired carpet. The walls had the stripes of shelves that had gotten bored and left. A chair waited with the kind of patience that makes you suspect it will bite you if you do not sit in it soon. The light existed but didn’t wish to help. In the corner, near a vent that had forgotten how to be useful, was a pile of things that had been set down by hands in a hurry. Noah’s bag wasn’t there. His jacket wasn’t there. But there was a fan cage with a missing bolt, and a screwdriver with tape around the handle the way he wraps it when the plastic starts to splinter because he believes in keeping things alive longer than the world thinks is polite. There was a piece of lined paper with three numbers on it and a circle that was not a zero. There was also, god help me and god help anyone who ever loved anyone, a note for me.

It wasn’t a note. It was the back of an envelope. It was the part of a pizza coupon where the fine print lives, and on it, in his small square handwriting that makes maps out of words, my name was written in pen that had run across something wet. It said, Lee. Under that, it said, Don’t sing down. Sing up. Roof was wrong. Room was a joke. The river is a wire. The last word was smudged like he had had to put it down too fast and the ink had not been ready to let him go. If I held the paper at an angle where all the light sucked itself to one edge, I could make out the shape of a t. It could have been tower. It could have been town. It could have been nothing. But it felt like a tower, the way a thought feels like it has height.

Behind me, Lionel breathed like a man who has decided to be on your side even if he will regret it later. Marnie was a shadow because she doesn’t understand doorways as boundaries. The sand-voiced woman had followed her own rules as far as they could go and then kept going because sometimes that is the kind of person you find yourself being without meaning to. The handheld whined, then clicked to silence, then gave me the tiniest tail of a frequency I had learned in the way you learn someone’s laugh.

“Water tower,” Mr. Avery said, not on the radio but in the doorway, because he had brought his ladder and his eyes and his ability to name the shape of anything. “By the tracks. The old one with the legs that look like they want to run off and marry a bridge. The city takes its time taking it down because it likes to have something to point at when it says history.”

We stood there until standing there was the wrong thing, which is not long when you have a place to run. I tucked the screwdriver into my back pocket, improper like a movie thief, and put the pizza envelope under my shirt because it wanted to live close to my ribs. Lionel said a number and the corridor decided to forget we had been there. We moved toward the air that had sky in it. The line at Gate E had become a clot of conversations and the camerawoman’s red light was still a small, angry planet. The hat man had become a person without a landmark. He did not look at me, which is the bravest thing he did that day. The white van idled and then thought better of it and turned itself off because it had listened to the air.

“Go,” Lionel said, and it wasn’t permission so much as a blessing with his mouth set so it wouldn’t be mistaken for one. “Don’t fall off anything on my property. After that, I’ll let the city claim you.”

We went. Mr. Avery had his truck and it smelled like wet cardboard and tomatoes and the kind of Sundays that make the week behave for a minute. He drove with his hands close together like he was coaxing the wheel into telling him something it had sworn to keep to itself. The water tower on Fifth is not beautiful unless you have needed to look up and been grateful there was something to aim at. Its paint flakes like old scabs and there is a No Trespassing sign that my eyes didn’t even bother to read. If you close your eyes you can picture kids kissing under it in the kind of cold that makes you forgive anybody almost anything. If you open them you see the ladder people aren’t supposed to climb and the ring of chain-link that says the city remembers the concept of liability.

The handheld woke up on its own like an animal that hears its name whispered from three rooms away. It gave me a breath and a sound and then a word that couldn’t help itself. Up, it said, and then not my name, but a sound that belonged to it. I put my hand on the fence and the fence hummed through my bones because everything is a wire if you ask it. Mr. Avery looked at his ladder and then at the posted sign, and he sighed the sigh of a man who grew up in a time when signs were suggestions if your neighbor needed something.

He said, “We’re borrowing,” and put the ladder where the fence is the most tired. He climbed and then I did because I will do a thing if someone older than me does it first even though I know that is not wisdom. On the other side, the grass made promises about snakes it was probably not going to keep. The tower’s legs rose out of the ground like something that meant to be permanent and got distracted. The bottom rungs of the ladder had been cut out long ago so people like me and Noah wouldn’t do what we were about to do. Someone had moved a pallet under the missing piece and there was a milk crate on top of that and this city will save itself with milk crates if it has to.

“Do not,” Mr. Avery said to me, which is what grown-ups say when they want a moment to think. He looked at the sky like he was taking its measure and then he looked at me because I was taking mine. He took the first rung so I wouldn’t feel stupid for taking the second. We went up with hands that knew enough not to be overproud. Halfway I could see the river through the gaps and it looked like a wire the city had flung at the horizon to try to keep it from leaving. The wind found me and did the trick where it registers as cold and wakes something inside you that is mad at you for bringing it along.

At the top there was the circle, the rusted halo where the platform is, and a hatch that has been locking and unlocking since the kind of people who build water towers were kids. The handheld made a sound like a coin deciding to be a note. I pushed the hatch because it needed to be pushed and it let me because everything in this town wants to believe in effort. The platform was a ring around a cylinder that used to hold other people’s thirst. There was chalk on the metal which is a nice trick if you can manage it, and someone had managed it. Roof, it said, and then Room, and then a line drawn between them that had a small sketch of a river under it like a mouth.

On the far side, in the shadow where the sun hadn’t bothered to be thorough, was a nest made out of useful trash. A coil of wire. A plastic crate. A jacket that wasn’t Noah’s but could have been if you didn’t know him. A jar with three screws and a bit that fits the fasteners they use on the vents. A battery that had been charged recently enough to be warm. There was a handheld bigger than the one I had and smarter, its antenna a polite question mark. And there was a notebook with a bear on the front, damp around the edges where the fog sets itself in the morning and refuses to leave you alone. I opened it and it was not his, and then I turned three pages and it was, because in the corner of the page there was a small drawing of a fan with angry arrows and a note about torque that he had underlined twice because he likes the way the word feels in his mouth.

He had written: If you stand here and point at the sky you can talk to the plane that is pretending not to hear you. If you stand here and point at the river you can talk to the other side. If you point at your own head nothing happens. He had also written three frequencies and a time and then the words Gate E that had been crossed out and turned into Gate F and then there was an arrow to a time that had an underline and a small expletive that he only uses when he believes he is alone. I put my finger on the place where his pencil had pressed so hard the paper’s fiber had gone down and then back up into a ridge. The wind pushed hair in my mouth and made the taste of metal into something like a prayer.

Below us, the city had moved without asking permission. A siren went without urgency, like it was tired of being itself. Across the way a kid dropped a skateboard and it ran without him. The white van took a right and then remembered it had meant to take the left and made a face about it and kept going. The handheld in my pocket said, in a voice that had lost a fight with a hallway, “We’re clear. Next set. South end park, under the bridge. Make the story the thing. The song is the excuse.” And then, softer and not on the handheld, in the air where your hair lifts when the weather decides, my name came as if the tower itself had a mouth.

I did not call back because if he was too far to hear me I did not want to throw my voice into the wind and let it belong to something that would not give it back. I held the notebook and gave my whole body to holding the notebook, to making it clear to whatever writes days and edits them later that this is a piece we were keeping. Mr. Avery touched my shoulder like he was about to start a story he had been telling his whole life. He pointed with his chin at the far edge of the platform where a small shape sat like a folded thing that had forgotten it could be unfolded. It was a recorder, the kind you use when you think you might catch a ghost if the ghost likes you enough. It had a sticker on it with a cat and the word Interesting, which is funny in its own small terrible way.

I pressed play because I am not the person who puts a thing like that in my pocket and waits. The first thing was wind, the second was train, the third was a voice I knew only because it was trying not to be itself. A kid reading off a list of ideas. Tell us about when you were small. Tell us about where you sleep. Tell us if you’ve ever wanted to disappear. Tell us if you’ve ever wanted to be famous. Then there was Noah, not reading, saying steadily the way he does when he is making a bargain with a machine, “Name is irrelevant, age is irrelevant, what matters is: do you know which way to lean when the ladder lies. What matters is the difference between roof and room. What matters is not letting the part of you that wants to make something be used to sell something you don’t want to own.” He laughed, but there was glass under it. “What matters is, tell my sister to stop trying to be the only door.”

The recorder clicked like a bug. The wind tried to be helpful and the tower declined to be moved by it. I put the cat back in my pocket because I am making a museum in there. Mr. Avery sighed like a man who has fixed gutters he didn’t have to fix and found that none of it keeps the rain from telling its own story. We climbed down because the sky thinks it is a roof and it is wrong and you shouldn’t explain it to it. At the bottom my knees did the thing knees do when they have been reminded of their job. A woman in a yellow raincoat that had never seen rain pushed a stroller past and the baby inside made a sound like the note you sing when you don’t think anyone is listening and you’re just checking if your voice still lives in your body.

“Under the bridge,” Mr. Avery said, because we had been told twice and only fools make God repeat Himself a third time. “The south end. The one with the good echoes.”

My phone buzzed with the ridiculous cheer of technology pretending it has a personality. It was Hanna, asking if I was late or very late and if she should tell Cole to whistle a dirge or something festive. I told her I was borrowing a ladder and I would pay her back in pies. She said to bring a hat because the sun sometimes remembers itself and hurts people who have been busy. She said she had seen a girl named Marnie on someone’s phone being righteous in a way she hasn’t seen since the protest for the school’s art program and it made her feel like making sandwiches for a hundred.

We drove south with the handheld in my lap and the river on our right like a friend who has decided to sulk. The bridge is a wide one with a tattoo of graffiti that changes its language depending on the weather. Underneath it the world has saved up so many conversations you can hear the old ones if you hold your breath. The white van was there, and a caterer’s van that might have been the same caterer that had smelled like meatballs at the yard, and a smaller car that had a child seat in it and a dream catcher hanging off the mirror. Folding chairs made a half circle like a mouth that wasn’t sure if it wanted to smile. The tripod pointed up like a question. The chalk took itself seriously. There was a ladder leaned into nothing because nothing is sometimes all you have.

I saw the girl from the letter on the back of the pizza coupon, or I saw a girl who could have been her, because she had that face kids have when they have made themselves clear to themselves and now they are going to say it out loud. The scarf woman was there and the clipboard man had put his clipboard down and was trying to make his hands look like they didn’t belong to him. The camera blinked its small red eye. The man without his hat stood in the shadow of a pillar and made his face into a correct expression, which is not hard if you practice and impossible if you mean it.

I could have walked straight into the middle of the chairs and made a speech and maybe I did in some version of the story where my knees were braver. I didn’t. I stood in the cindery shade and I listened to how the echoes figured me out and handed me back to myself. I tuned the handheld the way you tune the space behind your teeth before a note. I looked up because the word kept telling me to look up and above us there was the underbelly of the bridge with its painted warning and its rivets like braille. On the beam nearest where they had set up shop, there was chalk again, and I would know that handwriting in the dark long after I forget what I had for breakfast. It said, with an arrow that pointed toward the far bank and then curved back like it was embarrassed: Not a door. And under it, where only someone who has lived with him would have remembered to look, where the rust had made a little lip, there was a penny. He had wedged it in there. He had left me a toll he knew I would pay twice.

The sand-voiced woman looked at me and then at the chalk and then away as if she were making a decision about the shape of her day. She lifted her radio and said into it a sentence that was not for me and that nevertheless arrived where I live. “We’re done,” she said. “Wrap. You want to make your show, go where I don’t have to look at you. You want a story, tell your own.” She put the radio down like a person who had finally backed herself up to a wall that will hold. The man without his hat lifted his hands and then his shoulders and then his mouth and the camera, bless its immoral little heart, stayed on.

I have not yet figured out how to end anything. I know how to stop and breathe and call it a verse. I know how to take a step that looks like a bow if you tilt your head. Under the bridge, in the cinder dust and the echo, with my brother’s penny watching me like an eye, I sang the one thing I knew how to sing, which was not the river song or the alphabet or the audition piece they would have given me a hard-to-refuse no for, but a thing that had one word in it and a thousand rooms. I sang his name the way he says mine when he is saving me from myself. It went up into the beams and across into the dark and came down like a ladder that hadn’t lied yet. Somewhere something answered, or the wind pretended to and I decided to be gullible because sometimes that is all you have, a wire across water that makes you believe it will carry you.Chapter 8

The week opens like a mouth that doesn’t know whether it wants to bite or sing. The river looks clean only if you stand far enough back that it can lie to you. I take my coffee on the porch because Mrs. Pritchard has decided the kitchen is for people who don’t squander their mornings on worry, and I am trying to fool her into thinking I might one day qualify. The bees in the book on my night table have begun to hum even when the book is closed, a low vibration that lives under my collarbones. The letter above the bed is no longer above the bed because I cannot sleep under a promise that has learned how to curl its corners like it’s baring its teeth. I carry it in my pocket like contraband and take it out when I need to remember that paper is not a person and doesn’t get to tell me what to do.

Noah is a voice that moves through wires and sometimes traps itself in metal, which would be poetic if it weren’t terrible. Mr. Avery leaves oranges on our steps with the little round stickers still on them because he believes in signs you can peel. He talks about the tower like it is an old friend who owes him money. The radio man with the walnut hands calls twice to tell me a pirate he knows in another city picked up our loop and thought it was art, and once to ask me if I have slept, and once more to ask if I know I don’t have to answer questions with questions. I sing at Rhea and she glares me into breathing right and then lets me sit on her floor while the nail salon’s blowers hum like a chorus that doesn’t have the words yet.

At the diner, Hanna collects stories like she's going to can them for winter. She tells everyone who will pretend to listen that if anyone tries to get them to tell their trauma in exchange for a cup of warm soda they should bring that story to her and she will feed it pie until it forgets how to perform itself. Cole whittles a stir stick into a bird because his hands don’t know what to do when nothing is on the grill. Marnie shows up with hair damp from honesty and a waiver folded into a plane that doesn’t fly but refuses to admit defeat. She holds the camera woman’s number like a borrowed match. When the red light people come to order breakfast under a different name, Hanna raises her eyebrows like a guillotine and the man without his hat decides he isn’t hungry after all.

Gate E is taped over and Gate F has been papered with new handwriting that looks like the city’s sneer. GATE ANY, it says, which is not a gate that exists. The chalk under bridges has multiplied like mushrooms and the word story has become a plant people think you can water with a microphone. I walk with the scanner and the scanner walks with me, our pockets learning how to keep each other company. On a frequency I have not memorized, because I have stopped pretending my head can be a drawer that neatly, someone plays the loop with a warble like it’s old vinyl. The man with the hat has found his own echo. Except it breaks, once, and the break is where you hear the person who is not supposed to be here. Roof again, says the softness. Room is a joke. He is not laughing.

By Wednesday the city has split into teams: the ones who think the loop is a prank, the ones who think it’s salvation, the ones who say all doors are scams unless you bought them yourself, and the ones who will watch anything for a red light. When I walk into Mr. Ruiz’s store he salutes me with a battery pack and tells me he has a cousin who can get me a camera that looks like a phone but lies about what it’s doing with its eyes. I tell him I don’t need a camera, I need a door, and he says cameras are doors if you hold them wrong. He opens a drawer full of stickers with cats on them and I take one that says HELLO I AM BUSY and stick it inside my pocket where it can lie to my thigh.

The twins make a clubhouse out of blankets and refuse me entry until I sing the word please like a doorbell. Inside, they have drawn plans for a machine that turns story back into privacy. It runs on carrots because they understand economics. Mrs. Pritchard stands in the door and tells us we can have toast or we can have arguments, not both. She has a softness for boys who fix fans with missing bolts and she tries to hide it under a cardigan. At night she walks past Noah’s room and adjusts the air like it is a picture frame that keeps tilting. I consider putting the screwdriver back where I found it and decide against it because it’s mine now in the way that anything you put next to your heart for long enough becomes yours.

The sand-voiced woman calls on Thursday from a number that has disciplined itself to be unknown. She does not say her name, which means she has not chosen one for me yet either. She says she quit and I am supposed to applaud into the receiver. I tell her I don’t own clapping. She says she will only do this once and then never again, which is a joke people tell the universe when they want to see if it’s listening. There is a space under the expo, she says, and it’s not a room so much as an intention. You can get to it if you pretend to be lost and then commit to the performance. It has a door that pretends it isn’t, which is the mirror version of everything else around here. They like it because the light cooks your face and makes you shiny and you don’t realize it’s heat until you’re thirsty and there’s no water. She says she’ll show me the way and I tell her she doesn’t have to, and she says you think I didn’t grow up wanting to hand my story to the wrong man for safekeeping and then set his house on fire when he mispronounced my name in his credits.

We go at noon when the building is loud enough elsewhere that the quiet looks like it belongs. Lionel nods like a man who is tired of trying to be the parent of everyone younger than him, which is most of the city on a payday. The woman leads like a person who has been told not to lead and has decided to disobey beautifully. We take the service corridor because service is such a good lie. The stairwell smells like a refrigerator that lost its job. The door with the coffee-stained paint grants us audience like it has learned it can charge for the pleasure.

The intention is a glare under a strip of duct hung with pipe and apology. The heat sits on you like a grandmother with a grudge. There’s a chair in the middle that looks like it’s waiting for a decision to be made about it. There are two cameras, one blinking, one pretending not to, and a third that is only a red dot in a hole in the ceiling tile. The walls are chalked with prompts the way a blackboard remembers you even after the janitor has wiped you away. There is no sign of anyone at all, which is of course more terrifying than the opposite. In the back corner there is the smell of electricity beginning to regret a choice it made. Closer, and you see a coil of wire that wants to be a lasso and a battery that wants to be a bomb and a loop like a halo fallen into old gum. The woman kneels like you kneel in front of an animal you don’t want to scare. She points with her chin because your hands should never be the first thing you introduce.

“Your boy stood there and told me the difference between catching and holding,” she says, like she is reading my palm for me. “He touched the box and it stopped talking. He touched it again and it sang. He said your name like he was yodeling down a well and waiting to make you laugh. We told him he could help and he helped until he got bored of being useful. He said our ladder was lying and I pretended I didn’t know why that made me want to be better than I am.” She pulls the loop loose and hands it to me, and it has that warmth like a thing that has just stopped pretending to be alive. I ask her why she stayed and she says because everyone stayed until someone told them they didn’t have to, and she didn’t know she could be that person until she watched a girl draw a circle on a waiver with a pen that was running out and then keep writing.

In the carpet there is a scrape like a comet made with chairs. Under the chair there are two pennies with their faces down because luck has been instructed to stop showing off. There is a scuff on the wall the height of a boy who forgets to duck. I put my hand on it and it is the wishbone of a day. When we leave, the woman flips the breakers that feed the heat’s careless joy and the light drops like a man in a suit deciding on penance. We don’t shut it all down because the building will pretend we broke a law it made up just to scold us; we just make it uncomfortable for snakes. Lionel takes a step out of the way and lets us give him back his empty corridor.

On the way home I buy a dozen donut holes and give them all to Mr. Avery’s cat because he is the kind of animal that will live long enough to regret it and I think that’s a gift. Mr. Avery has drawn himself a map of the last two weeks on butcher paper and taped it to his wall with painter’s tape that promises to be gentle. He has drawn the city like a handprint and the river like a life line. He has written roof in three places and room in five and then scratched out two rooms because he decided those were jokes too. He says foxes are not the only things men hunt when they are bored and I tell him we are not yet hunted, we are being herded, which is a different humiliation. He turns the radio on and it says nothing, which is the part you have to pay attention to.

My mother used to say you have to practice hope the way you practice anything. She practiced on plants that didn’t know they were supposed to live. She kept basil alive for two summers in a row in a kitchen that faced a brick wall and called it a miracle and meant it. I practice in Rhea’s stairwell while the salon presses lacquer on other people’s problems. I practice in the diner’s walk-in when the lettuce thinks it’s the only thing that matters. I practice at the bandstand when the ghosts sit up politely and the teenagers roll their eyes behind me like I can’t see them. I practice speaking without giving anything away because the man with the hat has made me almost religious about the difference.

Friday, the loop stops for the morning. The air is clear enough to hear the hour. A child on the bus teaches his friend how to whistle without spitting, which is a public service. The scanner gives me the usual parade of small tragedies and melancholy victories. Someone reports a dog that is either lost or has decided to change families. A woman calls in to say her neighbor’s chimes are making her dream about being underwater. The yard guard at the rail calls Cole to say the man with the hat asked him if there was a back way into the east yard and he told him only if you could turn into a coin. Cole writes me a note on a napkin with ketchup and says if you need me to be noisy I can be.

In the afternoon the sand-voiced woman texts a picture of a van with a ladder and a bumper sticker that says ASK ME ABOUT CONSENT and I say this town has found irony and doesn’t know what to do with it. She sends a second picture of the same van across town and I overlay it on Mr. Avery’s hand-map in my head like I’m a boy with scissors. The line between them, if you draw it without being precious, cuts right across the park where the good echoes live and up toward the water tower where the pigeons do what they do. I think about the word ferry your frequencies and the way the river carries the same boat two directions and pretends it is a miracle. I think about the towers this city builds when it wants to tell the sky we meant to.

That night, when the twins go to sleep pretending to accept the concept of bedtime as currency, and Mrs. Pritchard sits on the couch with a magazine with recipes that start with words like artisanal and she writes NO in the margin in pen, I go up onto the roof like a person breaking a rule and paying cash for the privilege. The shingles smell like yesterday’s sun. The scanner hears a whisker of a laugh and then forgets it. The stars are arrogant and few. The water tower is a darker dark in the distance, a geometry lesson about limits. I think about the word tower and the way your throat is a tower that doesn’t always let you up, and I think about what Noah wrote, and I take the two pennies from my pocket and line them up on the ledge heads-up because superstition is a superstition because it works once and refuses to be mathematically interesting ever again.

I sing then, but not the way I have been. Not as if I am asking anyone to be good to me because I have been good to my voice. I sing like a person opening a window in a house where the air has gone sour. I sing one long, lazy vowel that could be any word and no word and I push it up with the muscles in my back and the ones in my stubborn heart. Somewhere a video doorbell records me and decides I am suspicious because I am not selling anything. Somewhere an old woman who has waited all day for someone to call her by the nickname she hasn’t told anyone she misses puts her hand on the lamp and says yes out loud. Somewhere a boy who is not my brother but is someone’s hears the sound and changes his mind about putting his hand on a hot light because somebody told him it might make a pretty picture.

Saturday morning is market. I wear my voice like a scarf and my jacket like an apology. I buy peaches that will bruise in the bag because I like food that tells on me. Mateo gives me plantains I don’t want because he has already decided how I should cook them. Mr. Ruiz sells a radio to a man who will never figure out how to put the batteries in right and everyone will be happier because of it. Marnie walks past with a bag of cilantro and a sense of purpose hanging off her shoulder like an unpaid bill. She tells me the camera woman turned her lens on the man without his hat and the internet taught itself a new flavor of annoyance, and I tell her annoyance is a marinade not a meal. She says the loop changed its last line and I stop breathing long enough for my cells to file a complaint. Ferry your frequencies, it says now, to the stone mouth. She has drawn a circle around stone and put a dot in the middle of it like a pupil. It’s not the river this time. It’s the thing that drinks from it.

The city has a filtration plant with a name that sounds like a bank. It sits at the bend where you can’t see the past or the future, only the work. The stone mouth is the intake, a square where water becomes patient. If you’re twelve and brave you jump from the wall into the pool and come up with your hair in your eyes and your lungs full of regret and the operator of the plant comes out and tells you to get off the property and secretly hopes you never learn how to listen. If you’re Noah you stand on the lip and talk to the machines because you are polite. The sand-voiced woman says don’t go because the sheriff likes a sign more than he likes a person and the plant operator has a brother who has a lot of opinions about teenagers. Lionel says go and then says he didn’t say anything. Mr. Avery says bring your ladder and your patience because one of those will be useful and you won’t know which until you’re on the wrong side of a fence.

The fence is higher than it looks because it wants to make you feel small early in the day. There’s a gap at the bottom where water has had an argument with dirt and won. The air smells like iron and municipal intent. The stone mouth yawns and there is no tongue. I think about the word intake and the way it is a small theft, a justifiable one if you like teeth. The scanner burps. The loop tries to particle itself in the spray. I can hear the recorded instruction with the person’s real air behind it, like the worst kind of dub. The plaza around the plant is empty because people don’t like to park their stories near their water.

We walk the perimeter because any building that says no has taught itself to be interesting. The ladder is not useful. My patience is. We find a service door the color of public money and there is a bell that looks like a joke. Mr. Avery knocks in the pattern that makes people believe you belong and I am prepared to sing the word please until the operator’s heart grows three sizes. The man who opens the door is a small law unto himself. He has the eyes of a person who sees both sides of a coin and tells you neither is valuable. He listens to us without moving his mouth. I tell him my brother has been trying to make friends with machines and he says machines don’t have the right kind of mouth for that. The sand-voiced woman tells him there is an unauthorized broadcast using his building as a megaphone and he laughs and says there are four and only one is interesting. The fox hunter tells him there is a loop that is telling kids to come to the water because water makes good television and the man’s mouth makes a shape like a lock that’s afraid of being picked.

He lets us in because all the doors in this city have a quota. He walks us between pipes that are older than anybody’s worst mistake. The sound of a building drinking is not the sound you think it is. It’s the sound of a person who can finally breathe after they realize they don’t have to carry everything on their back. There’s a grate above the stone mouth and on the grate is a small, ugly, clever thing that pretends it isn’t. It’s the loop. It’s a box in a bag like the kind you bring sandwiches in if you raise your children right. It’s attached with thrift and faith and two zip ties that were stolen from an electrician’s pocket. It is not a place you can climb to unless you believe gravity is a suggestion.

Noah would have gotten it down in three moves including a flourish that would have made me swear at him. I have a screwdriver and a fox hunter and a man with a ring of keys larger than my wrist who says if he didn’t sign a paper that makes him responsible for this he would let me do whatever I wanted. He finds the part of the grate that was meant to lift. He finds the tool that helps him pretend he doesn’t know how to help. He gives me the bag without saying be careful because he knows I am already carrying that. The loop sputters when I unplug it, like it has been interrupted in the middle of a sentence it thought was important. I say sorry to it and then don’t because I owe my apologies to other things.

Inside the bag is not only the box but a note in handwriting that is neither the hat man’s round c nor the sand-voiced woman’s careful annoyance. It is a third hand, broad and neat, with a letter r that turns the wrong way like it learned to write from a mirror. It says schedule like it likes the idea of a metronome. It lists times and places that could be anywhere and then it lists one that is ours in a way that makes my teeth coat with sugar and fear. Memorial. Sunday night. Gate C is back like a joke that insists on itself. Bring your story, it says. Bring your original song. Bring your brother.

I do the thing where I laugh in a way that scares the twins when they hear it later because it has a sound inside it like a thin thing snapping. Mr. Avery takes the note and flattens it with his palm and gives it back. The operator says he has never liked television because it makes your face too flat. The sand-voiced woman says she knows a person in the city office whose job title is so long it doesn’t mean anything and perhaps we should say something to her anyway. The fox hunter says he can put a voice on top of a voice if he wants to and I say I don’t speak over people, I sing around them. He grins and says he can make room for that.

On Sunday, the city cuts itself in half for the church crowd and the people who go to the farmers’ market late on purpose to get the bruised fruit for free and tell themselves they are doing a good deed. I go to the arena early because I am done arriving where I am supposed to be at the exact moment somebody else thinks I should arrive. Lionel watches me walk across the floor like I’m practicing a slow event and he decides not to stop me because he can tell I want to be the person he doesn’t have to stop. The scoreboard is asleep. The echo inside the building does the thing men do when they are trying not to laugh. The floor smells like the bottom of a gym bag that has seen sadness. Gate C is taped open with a strip of gaffer that smells like a movie that didn’t win any awards.

They are setting it up like a chapel to not quite enough. Chairs in rows. A runner down the center like a strip of shadow. A stage made of promises that will hold until you step on the wrong corner. A portable light that would like to be the sun when it grows up. The scarf woman, hatless, frazzled, mutter-reading her waivers like they are prayers in a language she can barely pronounce. The camerawoman has the decency to look tired, which makes me want to feed her. The hat man has a new hat because men like that believe costume change is character growth. He smiles when he sees me and then stops because his mouth remembers that we have both decided to skip artifice today.

There are kids. Some have adults who are not their parents but have been deputized by life to care. Some have nobody and this building makes the nobody bigger and I want to take it and put it in my pocket and sit on it. Marnie is there with her full battery of scorn. The twins got past Mrs. Pritchard by telling her the truth, which she has always been vulnerable to, and they sit in the front row like judges on a game show that will not forgive you for being dishonest. Rhea came because she says she goes where her students are and she isn’t wrong. Hanna came because she believes in coffee and justice, and she brought both. Cole came because he wants to whistle a dirge in a new acoustical environment, and because he is loyal to the idea that you can be useful to people who tell you they don’t need you. The sand-voiced woman stands near a pillar and is not filming, which is the bravest thing I have seen anyone do in a building like this.

Mr. Avery has the fox hunter’s kit in a bag that says SPINACH and he is rolling out wire like a spider that has had enough of subtlety. He looks at the ceiling and sees the sky. He looks at the floor and sees dirt. He shows me with one hand how he will put my voice where it is supposed to go so other voices don’t have to carry it like a weight. He wears his Sunday shirt that is just the regular shirt but ironed, and the iron mark on the sleeve looks like a country on a map.

The hat man starts his speech too early because men like him do that. He talks about stories like they are deer that wandered into his backyard and lay down politely. He talks about opportunity like he has a warehouse full of it and is going to let us have some since he is in a generous mood. He talks about lights and eyes and beginnings. I don’t listen because the building hums when a lie gets up on its hind legs, and I like to listen to the hum instead. It hums a lot. The camerawoman’s red light opens like an eye that is trying to be honest but can’t because honesty would mean turning itself off.

We don’t interrupt him. We let him think he has the room because that is the rule we have labored under and we are trying to teach ourselves to break rules respectfully so it sticks. When he says the word story for the seventh time, the scanner in my pocket clicks and gives me my brother like it is dealing five-card to a person who cannot lose this hand. The ceiling seems to lean down. The river in my chest rises. Noah says, in a voice like when he is telling me not to touch a thing that will cut me, “Check the lights.”

It is a stupid instruction. It is a perfect instruction. The portable light on its tripod hums like a thing with a secret. The fox hunter was already walking in that direction because he is a machine about machines and he knows where the sound in his head attaches to the world. He is slow and polite and efficient and I love him. He uncaps the housing like a nurse opening a vein and inside the light there is not only light. There is a box, the loop’s cousin, with a sticker from a store that died. There is a wire that doesn’t belong and a battery that is the wrong color and a switch that is the kind that says you can touch me, I won’t bite. The hat man sees it and does the thing men like him do when they see a problem they caused and realize people are watching. He says, to nobody in particular, how did that get there, and it almost sounds like he doesn’t know. He probably doesn’t. That’s the thing.

Lionel has called himself by name from the back with his radio and four other guards who have decided not to decide anything until the part where they have to. He walks to the light like he has been waiting for a portable metaphor that long. He looks at the box like he looks at spilled soda on the court. He holds it like he holds a child who is not his and whom he doesn’t want to teach to cry. He turns it off and the loop dies with bad timing, which is to say, in the middle of a sentence. The fox hunter’s wire catches the air like a net you throw into water and then wait for fish to decide whether to be caught. The radio in my pocket talks to me like I am the only person in this room, and he says, because he has always known which way to lean when the ladder lies, “I can lift it. Sing up, Lee.”

I do not audition. I do not fetch the paper letter from my pocket and ask it for permission, because the answer it has given me every day this week is no matter what word it uses. I stand where my feet stop and decide that is a good enough place to not be allowed. Rhea nods her chin because she is always keeping a time signature for me even when I call it cruel. The twins find each other’s hands because they like better to hold each other when they’re about to be surprised. The scarf woman with the waivers folds them into boats and then squares again because she has to do something with her fingers since she has chosen not to point them at anyone. The camera keeps its red light on because it doesn’t have free will and I forgive it.

I sing up. I take the line that’s a bridge and make it an opening. I take the vowel that feels like the river in my mouth and I push it toward the ceiling until the rafters remember that they used to be trees. I give the word that has been stuck between my teeth since the letter arrived a life and let it run. I tell the room a thing I have not told it before, which is that my story is not an excuse, not a ticket, not a coupon for half off my dignity. I say it in notes because that’s a language this building understands better than law. The fox hunter slides the little switch on the box again but this time he’s the one doing the telling. The wire goes from our light to the arena’s bones and from there to the draft in the door and from there out into a city that is ready to feel like it was invited.

In the radio, in the handset, in my pocket, in the loop, in the light, in the echo, Noah laughs. It’s a small laugh, the one he does when his hands are inside a machine and he can see the point where the instructions lose their confidence. He says, not to everyone and to me in particular, “There.” I cannot turn toward where the voice is because it is everywhere and nowhere and under my skin. I sing into the voice because if I say his name out loud in the middle of this it will shape me into a person I cannot use right now. I sing what he said on the tower, the part about the ladder and the difference between catching and holding, and the camerawoman makes a sound like she remembered herself.

The man with the hat does the thing where he tries to enter the scene like he engineered it. He takes a step into my note and looks sad. There is a speech ready in his mouth about how the show is just a stage, how the show is just a door, how the show never meant to bite, and how if we could all sit down and agree to be reasonable the show could continue to pay his rent. He is going to say the word opportunity again. He is going to say the word resilience and mean it as an invoice. He lifts the mic and Lionel lowers it with one finger like a god pressing a planet into place on its orbit. The scarf woman puts down the waivers and walks to the edge of the stage and takes a seat and crosses her legs like she is going to watch something she has not seen in many years, and I think I love her a little bit.

It happens like this, because sometimes a story is kinder than it has any right to be. On the far side of the arena where the staff hallway turns into a small lie about being an exit and the air smells like mustard and the hands of men who sell beer, a door that says Authorized swings with reluctance. A boy steps into the glare like he has been living in a room that didn’t have a definition for light. He has a bag with a rocket patch because of course he did not let it be anyone else’s. He has grease on his wrist and a cut on his forehead which he is letting bleed because he does not care to tell his face where to put its liquids. He pauses like he has left something on a stool and then decides nothing in that room belongs to him. He hears me sing his name without the sound of his name in it and he smiles, and it is the kind of smile you cannot learn and cannot buy, the one that happens when a stupid coincidence and an intelligent effort meet in a hallway and recognize each other.

People make noise like they have just remembered it is a tool they own. The hat man takes a step that looks like he had intended to be standing here all along. The sand-voiced woman moves like a songbird between a cat and a window in the friends’ house. The fox hunter checks a connection even though he knows what makes things break is never the connection you can see. Mr. Avery puts one hand over his heart because he has been married to gravity a very long time and this is a moment where it might decide to be flirtatious. Rhea does not clap because she knows music is not done yet. Marnie looks at me in a way that says if you had not sung up, I would have done something else destructive and I nod at her because destructiveness is a tool also and I am not going to deny its dignity.

Noah is not a bird but if he were he would be a stubborn one that refuses to migrate. He walks through people like he has decided to become a person who can walk through people without apologizing. He goes up the side stairs and the stage, which is a liar, holds. I stop singing without letting the sound drop because I have learned that’s how you do it, you put it down where it belongs and don’t let anyone see where you keep your secrets. He looks out at the crowd like he is checking for a certain kind of cloud. He leans into the mic even though I have told him about microphones and the way they will take your breath and sell it to your least favorite neighbor. He says, “I was in the room they make under the building. It is a joke room. I borrowed it. The ladder lied. I made it tell the truth. The door is somewhere else.”

Then we have the part where life has noted that we are trying to do something and will now present us with a test of how much we meant it. The hat man wedges himself between the laugh in the room and the point where the sound becomes a wave. He says into the nearest thing that makes voices bigger that we have to stop to make room for other stories because fairness is a trampoline men who think like him like to jump on. He says we cannot accuse without process. He says we have to sign if we want to be seen. He says, and this part is almost a kindness, that if we want to leave we can leave and nobody will stop us, but if we want to stay we have to consent to a certain amount of being filmed.

I have watched the city collect itself before and I can feel it do it now. It’s in the shoulders of the woman who brought her son with the unruly hair and the perfect pitch. It’s in the way the twins stand up in their seats like small fires that finally learned their first trick. It’s in the way the scarf woman shrugs off the thing she brought here to protect her and then realizes she is better without it. It’s in the way Lionel’s hand rests on the mic like a man who has found himself holding a snake he will not let bite. It’s in the way Mr. Ruiz has his hands in his pockets and one of those hands is a fist because he is remembering a cousin who didn’t get to make his own rules about his voice.

The fox hunter flips the switch that makes his wire more polite and less dramatic, which has the effect of cutting the hat man’s mic without making a scene, which is what grown-ups do when they want to teach a child how to sit in a room. The camera keeps rolling because the camera is the least interesting person here. I ask the hat man if his company has a first aid kit because there is blood on my brother’s face and nothing at all else matters until a person’s fluid is in the right container. He says yes and the scarf woman runs to find it and Marnie runs sideways for water and the sand-voiced woman runs a hand through her hair like she is loosening screws in there so the ceiling doesn’t collapse.

Noah lets me press the napkin on his head and he let me be dramatic about it only a little. He tells me in two sentences the shape of the days I missed and then in two more tells me a larger shape I will have to sit down to understand. He talked to some boys who think their hands are work because they have learned how to carry tripods. He asked a woman a question about who owns the names she writes on waivers and she didn’t answer because that is not how her job is done. He found something under a vent and made it behave. He tried to take a box that didn’t belong and they took his bag instead. He walked out when he realized the only door leading to me was the wrong one and he decided to be wrong on purpose if it meant finding it faster.

I look at the hat man because I am not done with him even if I am done with today. I tell him a thing Rhea makes me practice, which is a sentence that sounds like it was written in a book and means more in an arena. I tell him that stages and doors are not synonyms even when a lighting plot pretends they are. I tell him that if he wants a story he can sit in the chairs he bought and wait for it to arrive when it is ready. I tell him that he should stop writing the word resilience on children’s bodies with a Sharpie because it is hard to scrub off and nobody should have to stand in the shower trying to make their skin mean something else. I tell him that my brother taught me how to keep a ladder honest and I intend to make it public domain.

He does not cry, because he is not that person. He looks around for the person who is supposed to protect him from the consequences of his ideas and finds no one, because the scarf woman has decided to be interested in sandwiches and the camerawoman has put her lens down and is letting herself watch with her own eyes and Lionel has remembered his name and what it feels like in his mouth and has decided to say it in rooms. The waivers are on the floor like leaves nobody will rake. The little box with the wrong sticker sits in my hand and vibrates like a small heart because we have decided it won’t talk today.

After, when the arena empties the way a bowl does when someone has decided soup might be too heavy, and the twins are convinced that the sandwich Hanna hands them is legally theirs because on Sundays children get extra, and Rhea has told me in three glances and one squeeze of my shoulder that the note I landed in the middle could have been fatter, and Mr. Ruiz has offered Noah a radio that will keep him out of trouble and into different trouble, and Mr. Avery has drawn a line on his butcher paper that goes from the door to the stage to the air and labelled it corridor like he is mapping an old house, and the sand-voiced woman has written me a number on the back of a sticker I will lose until I need it, and the fox hunter has put his spider back in his bag and told me the city is noisier and better for it, and Marnie has written “this is not a door” on the inside of her wrist in marker that will stay for at least two showers, and the hat man has found his hat and leaves with it like it can be a thing that stands in for a spine, and the camera is on the floor like it’s tasting dust and finding it complicated, I go home.

Mrs. Pritchard stands in the hall like she has remembered what it was like to have two kids leave her house and not know if she would get two back. She touches Noah’s face without asking and he lets her and I watch the muscle in her jaw decide not to leap into words. The twins show him the clubhouse and he pretends not to fit in the opening and then folds himself to fit because he knows where gladness is kept. The cat does the kneading thing on the arm of the chair like it is making bread out of our day. I pin the letter back above my bed and pin above it the note that says Saturday June twelfth because it might still be a day and not a knife. I slide the screwdriver under my pillow because there is no point pretending I don’t sleep better when I am ready to take something apart.

I dream in engineering drawings. I see the city as a schematic and the river as a cable and the tower as a resistor and the arena as ground and my voice as a voltage I can choose to drop where it will warm, not burn. In the morning I wake up with the shape of a song in my mouth and a bruise on my hip from the part of my life that has been keeping me on this side of the roof. Noah is in the kitchen making toast with a fan because sometimes when you fix a thing it wants to help. He looks at me with the face he makes when he is about to tell me a truth small enough to fit in a pocket but big enough to hold a house.

“They didn’t make me,” he says, before anyone can ask, which is his own prayer. “They just told me the kind of story they wanted and stood back with the camera on to see if I would decide to be the sort of person that story would be easiest to film. It turns out I can say no to being lit like that. It turns out the room is not the last place.”

“Where is it,” I say, even though I already know he is going to tell me something I cannot find on Mr. Avery’s map because he has drawn it too much like a hand.

“It’s not a where,” he says. “It’s a who. The door you want is people. You bring them like voltage and then you touch their hands together and a light turns on. That’s all you can control. That, and ladders. I know a few more tricks now.”

I think about Gate C and Gate E and Gate F and the stone mouth and the note with the wrong r and the tower’s smudge of chalk and how many ways a door can pretend to be itself. I think about Sunday night and Saturday morning and the two weeks I asked the room to hold and how it did not, because rooms are not kind, only the people in them. I think about the letter with its starburst that has shed silver on my fingers and how it is still an invitation even if it is to something I have chosen to attend differently. I think about Rhea’s sentence shaped like a doorknob: you can do both.

Noah says, “We get to write our angle. We get to say where we stand. If they put a spotlight on the wrong place we move to the right one and make them follow. That’s not insolence. That’s stagecraft.” He sits at the table and the chair that has been waiting for this boy creaks like a good dog. “Also,” he says, and I feel our house lean in, “we should go to the finals. But we should bring our own lights.”

I hate how much I love him when he is right. The calendar over the stove has a circle around the date so hard the paper is tired of it. I have two songs and one of them is a lie and one of them is too much like a door, and I decide I might make a third. Mrs. Pritchard says if this is to happen in a building she will make sure we have clean socks and a bag with almonds and a banana that has more yellow than brown because faces matter. The twins create a sign that says PRIVATE ENERGY and plan to hold it up when I breathe. Mr. Avery asks if he should bring both ladders and I tell him yes because one of them is for confidence. Hanna says she will bring enough thermoses to annoy the man at the arena who thinks the coffee inside has to be his. Cole says he will whistle in the key the building wants so it doesn’t spit me out. Marnie says she is going to set up a table that says TELL YOUR OWN STORY HERE and charge nothing for it. The sand-voiced woman says she has found a job at a place with fewer hats and more assumptions she can live with.

I spend Monday, because the day demands to be spent, walking the city and naming its doors. Some are painted red and pretend to be fancy. Some are dented and pretend to be strong. Some are gates, the letter does not matter. Some are under bridges and some are on roofs and some are in faces. I sing when the air tells me it is ready to be a room and stop when it isn’t. I talk to Mr. Ruiz about a battery that won’t hold a charge and he says a thing that is not about batteries at all. I practice at the bandstand and the ghosts tap their feet with the courtesy of a different era. I stand on the tower with my hands at my sides like they could keep me from falling, which is not a plan, and I do not climb over the rail because we have decided we are not that story.

The loop still tries, sometimes. It shows up in boxes in small rooms and inside cameras that weren’t made to hold it. It says Gate with different letters, as if changing a vowel will trick anyone who has learned anything. It says bring your story and I say, I brought it home. It says roof and I say room and it says room and I say hand and it says hand and I say door. It is a loop. That is not an insult. We are loops also. We do the days until they mean something or until we do. I get to repeat my note until it lands in the world exactly where it belongs and when it bounces I decide to be amused.

On Tuesday night, the power in our block does the thing that gives our house its personality to the rest of the grid. The lights stumble and think about it and then do nothing, and then decide to practice being gone. The street hum changes key. The river makes itself known not as a surface but as a presence. The neighbors come onto their porches and pretend to be curious and glad to see one another, which is practice for being human. Mrs. Pritchard finds the candles that smell like things nobody needs their house to smell like, vanilla that has a secret it won’t tell, cinnamon’s younger brother. The twins say we should tell stories and both start at the same time and laugh at the collision. Noah pulls the fan cage from the corner where the cat has been using it as a second bed and tells us he can make it spin on whatever is left in the wires if we don’t let the room gaslight us into thinking it’s done loving us. He does. We sit in the breath of it and none of us say the word final out loud because the night hates a declaration.

When the lights come back we all pretend we didn’t miss them except me. I missed them. I miss everything that’s been switching on when I ask for it lately, and everything that refuses. I lie in bed under a ceiling that would like me to be small and let it. I hold the letter and the screwdriver and the cat sticker that says hello, and I think about how to make something that looks like a door behave like one. I think about the man with the hat and the woman with the sand and the boy who wrote an r the wrong way and the way a camera does not know when to close its eye. I think about the people who stood in a line and found out they weren’t a supply chain. I think about the stage and the difference between a floor that holds you up and a floor that wants to make a show out of gravity.

Wednesday pours itself like coffee. The river is a wire. The tower is an instrument. The arena is a mouth. The city has been hers and then not hers and then ours and it will decide again without asking, and we will decide anyway. I lace my shoes with aggravating patience and put my song in my pocket like a folded map and put my hand on the door and the door is a door because sometimes the universe has a sense of timing. When I step out, Mr. Avery is already on his porch with a ladder leaning on the rail and a face that says he dreamed about a wiring diagram and woke with a desire to fix a cloud. He nods like men nod when words would turn it sentimental. Across the street the twins have painted our sign wrong and it is perfect. Private Energy, it says, and underneath, in a smaller hand, Community Allowed.
