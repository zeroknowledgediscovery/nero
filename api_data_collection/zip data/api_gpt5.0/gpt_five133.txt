The first time he came into the market with that laugh on him, the air over Doha was gray with a dust that clung to hair and teeth and the back of the tongue. The market was new but also old—tile and steel, arches pretending they were carved by hand. An old man with sliced dates on a tray tried to wave away the dust, flicking at it like it was just a momentary bad mood, and it stuck to his fingers.

Cesar walked the lanes like he owned them. He was big and he moved like he had extra joints to keep track of. People let him through. The way he smiled—it was too bright and too wide. The way he didn’t blink at anyone, just did that thing he did, soft at first and then louder: an absurd raspberry, like a child’s taunt blown into the bodies of women as they passed him, work shoes and handbags and the momentum of their errands. He stood next to the woman selling tangerines, leaned in with the wet noise at her cheek, watched her flinch and then looked past her, laughing. She yelled after him in Arabic, a good thick swear that could have taken the wheels off a bicycle, but he didn’t turn around. He took a bag of tangerines, put money down, and blew a raspberry in the general direction of the woman’s daughter too. That made the daughter’s mouth tighten up like a scar.

Nobody wanted to admit that this was frightening. It was ridiculous, which isn’t the same thing as harmless, and it was wrong. But who do you call about a man who does nothing but point his mouth at your face and make a sound a toddler would make, and laugh? The security cameras watched it with that flat fish-eye open gaze that records everything and says nothing. A little cluster of pigeons stuttered across the rafters like they were spelling a word. He scared them, too.

A boy named Rami followed him at a distance. He counted Cesar’s steps and tried to guess where the next laugh would skitter. Cesar’s jacket was threadbare, which doesn’t mean much in heat like this. The shoulders of it were shiny with wear. His hair looked like he cut it himself, dull scissors, no mirror. He smelled like cheap cologne and something faintly metallic beneath, something that looked like heat distortion if it had a scent. The boy tried to catch his eye but failed, beautifully.

At the far end of the corridor, near the butcher’s stall, he waited for a woman with a cart. She pulled a scarf over her hair as she approached him, pulled it tighter around her face when he lifted his chin. She muttered to herself, I’m not in the mood. He tracked her movement, and when she passed he leaned down so that he was close enough to catch the salt of her skin, and he blew the berry noise with a straight seriousness that made the butcher’s apprentice stop cutting the fat off a lamb’s leg mid-swipe. The woman swung her cart. It bumped his hip. She didn’t say sorry. He laughed like a cracked bell. Not loud; not timid. He laughed like he had found something so trivial and so terrible that he had no choice but to laugh or be buried.

“He does it to all the women,” Rami said to the apprentice. “But not to men.”

“Sure,” the apprentice said, and looked away, skin prickled with a feeling he didn’t want to keep.

You could say Cesar did other things too. He wasn’t a ghost with one trick, no matter how many videos made him a punchline for the morning shows. People were more complicated than their worst. He collected train timetables, paper ones that the stations would stop printing in a year. He read them the way a person reads palms. He fed stray cats by throwing food to the ground with a ritual exactness, and he never touched them. He once helped a tourist stand up after the tourist had fainted from heat, his hands careful on the man’s shoulder, his mouth quiet. He sat sometimes with a cup of coffee in front of him as if he were waiting for a verdict. He called a number at three in the morning that always rang and never answered. But the thing that stuck to him in the city’s mouth was the raspberries, and the laugh.

His grief rode in him like ballast. That was visible too to anyone with eyes and the bad habit of noticing things. Grief had rounded off his shoulders and carved a groove at the edge of his mouth. He looked like a man who had said I’m fine in too many rooms and then swallowed the answer back. When he laughed, it was like the grief had been made into a part of the instrument. A low fuzzy sound laid over everything else.

In a classroom with shadeless windows and rows of screens asleep and waking like breathing things, Sergeant Morpurgo laid out a dozen historical cases that had nothing and everything to do with him. She was called Sergeant by her students because she’d asked for it, and because she had earned it somewhere far away and long ago. But she was still Professor Morpurgo on the roll sheets, and on the letterhead, and in the emails from the dean, and in the way her students hesitated before asking her practical questions about exam formats and also impossible questions about what should be done with a city that insisted on being a city. Sergeant was a weight she put on herself like armor. Professor was the tie she wore to remind herself to speak with care.

“Let’s say someone broke the rules,” she said. “Let’s say they broke the rules in a way that wasn’t quite illegal. Let’s say you had the resources to stop them. What would you do? Not what could you do. What would you do. And why.”

She could feel the dust in the air here too. In Doha, even the newest buildings had a thin residue of the oldest desert, no matter how many filters ran night and day. She thought of home as a slightly tilted table where every marble rolled north, toward light and sea. She had learned how to stand still on it.

One student, a girl with braids neat as a grid, lifted a hand. “We make a law.”

“Laws are the shape of a city,” said Morpurgo. “But laws arrive slower than harm.” She felt a small electric twitch in her left wrist that made her want to rub it. She didn’t. The class watched her. She smiled, like a teacher in a poster. “What else.”

A boy spoke. A girl over him. Another girl under her. Many answers, all of them earnest, too clean in the way that answers are before they’ve had to get dirty. The class knew her subject by heart—the ethics of emergent city systems, the moral calculus of scale—and also they didn’t know anything at all. She had always liked that combination. It was hopeful. They didn’t yet believe the phrase, There is no neutral ground.

On her phone, in a window she kept below her notes, a clip of a man in a market did a ridiculous thing to a woman’s face and laughed, and she watched it loop once, twice, and then turned the phone over on the table, screen down, as if it might try to talk to someone else without her having to listen.

She had noticed him because somebody sent the clip to her with the subject line: Is this your department? and a winking emoji, which she thought was cruel and maybe also boring. She had noticed him because the second clip was not a market but a hospital corridor, and the sound he made was not a raspberry but a whistle blowing over his teeth, and the woman he did it to had her hand on the bar of a gurney and turned her face away from him like she had burned it. He had laughed then too, silently. She had noticed because people started to say his name under their breath, like someone naming a rash at a dinner party: This is happening to me, and I can pretend it isn’t, but why.

He called himself Cesar. He told a man on a bench who asked him, between cigarettes, that he was named after a Caesar but not like that. The man didn’t ask like what. He nodded, because nodding was the habit of a man who has made his decisions long ago and mostly sticks with them. The man told Cesar that he seemed upset.

“I am,” said Cesar. It was late. The city was soft all over with the sound of tires and shoes and the quiet machinery behind walls humming through the night. “I am upset and wrong. I am perfectly wrong.”

“Why.”

“Why not,” said Cesar, and blew a soft little sound at a passing poster of a woman smiling under a hair-care advertisement. The curl in the poster’s hair didn’t tremble. The paper had no feelings. He laughed at that and then he stopped laughing and went still, as if his own shadow had said, Okay, that’s enough.

He knew what it was to weep like you were falling down a well. He knew what it was to wake up with the face you loved in your brain for a half-second before the brain remembered there was no such face, not anymore. He could narrate without starting to cry, the whole story of the minus. He could say: she died. He could also say: they left. He could also say: something was taken from me, and I’m not sure I deserve to get it back, and that feels like the shape of justice in a cold room, and if you disagree I will mock you with the smallest sound I can find, because small things are the most annoying and the truest. He could say all of that, and he would, if anyone asked. They rarely did. They asked him other questions. They asked him to stop. They asked him to go away. They asked him if he thought this was funny. He did not. He laughed anyway.

When the email from Bureau of Urban Cohesion—a committee whose acronym already felt tired—landed in Sergeant Morpurgo’s inbox, it was blunt, because some offices think blunt means sincere.

Can you consult. The city has a case. There’s an enforcement option but we’re not sure we’re allowed to take it. He’s not hurting anyone. He’s hurting everyone. He’s creating a climate of fear that’s technically legal and definitely not in any way acceptable. You know what we mean. They attached nine videos to show that they weren’t being hysterical. They weren’t. There are better words for that feeling than hysterical. There are also worse ones.

She watched the videos in the order the committee sent them, and then in a time sequence that took her from the first clip—a park, a lemonade vendor, a cluster of women on yoga mats, and him stepping in at the edge of the shot with a boyishness that was creepy because it was wrong on his face—to the most recent, in which he lurked at a subway platform, waited for the doors to open, and then made his sound at the face of a woman getting off the train so that the woman stepped back without meaning to and fell into the man behind her and then there was a little chain of bodies falling like dominoes, gentle but sharp. He didn’t touch anybody. He lifted his palm in a weird gesture like a bishop’s blessing and then he laughed, softly, as if he thought the laugh might land on the floor and skip.

Okay, she said to the device when it paused the video for her at the frame where he looked closest to her. Okay.

There was one other thing she noticed, which was nothing, which is to say it was the absence of something she expected to see: the smallest shift in his throat when he did that sound, the flex of the skin and the fat and the muscle under it. It didn’t happen. The skin lay flat and obedient over him, composure like a trick. She turned the laptop toward the window like she could glare him into being normal, and the city outside shrugged.

Her students left the room in twos and ones, one of them staying behind to tell her that the reading had been hard, sorry, could she please explain on Wednesday what “distributed agency” meant, because the footnote was confusing. She explained it in three sentences. The student nodded like they understood, which they didn’t, not quite, because it’s hard to understand something that keeps moving in your hands while you’re trying to put a fence around it with words.

“You’re thoughtful,” she said to the student as they packed up. “That’s enough for now.”

On the whiteboard behind her a thin residue of last week’s lecture had refused to be wiped clean. A sentence with almost all the verbs smudged out. She didn’t write new words over it. She left it ghostly. The room hummed and pulsed, and if you listened too hard you could imagine you were inside a heart.

“Professor,” the student said at the door, “do you need anything.”

“We all do,” she said.

Rasha met her downstairs, near the sculpture that looked like it might float away if not for the invisible wires. Rasha wore a scarf the color of pomegranate and had a small gold hoop through the cartilage of her ear. She had been in the class three years ago and had become the kind of assistant who arranged your life in quiet increments so that you could think about the questions that made your own head sound like a wind tunnel.

“Your committee,” Rasha said. She held up her phone with the emails on it like a fisherman showing a fish flapping on a line. “They’re excited.”

“They’re nervous.”

“We could do with fewer nervous men making decisions.”

“We could do with fewer men making them,” Morpurgo said, and smiled. The joke hung a second in the air before it settled. They were careful with their differences. They were careful with being funny. “We’ll go and talk to him,” she said. “If we can find him.”

“He’s a celebrity. He’ll be where celebrities go.”

“Then a mirror, and a room with bad lighting.”

Rasha laughed. She stopped laughing, looked at the floor. “Do you think he’s dangerous.”

“Yes.”

“But not like that.”

“Not like what.”

“Not like the way people in power like to say dangerous. Not to justify… you know. The hard hand.”

“I don’t know anything. That’s why we’re going to find him.”

Cesar was at the marina for a while, watching boats he’d never set foot on. The water had the color of money under cloud. A woman in a yellow dress walked past and he did his sound without even looking up, like a dog sighing in sleep, and then he laughed, small and true. The woman stopped, turned back. “Excuse me,” she said, in a desert-calm voice that had iced edges to it. “Don’t.”

He lifted his hands like he was surrendering and said, “I’ve already done it.”

“Then undo it.”

“It’s the kind of thing that can’t be undone.”

She looked like she was cataloguing all the kinds of things in the world and sorting them into columns. She looked like she was deciding which one she was tired of being today. “You think it’s funny,” she said.

“No.” He shook his head. “No, that’s not the shape of the laugh.”

He didn’t do it again to her. He didn’t need to. The first time always did something. Not magic. Not trauma like a movie. But it did a small etch in the day that, later, when the woman tried to remember whether she had bought milk or not, would catch at her, and she would think, What did he want. And he wanted nothing from her. He was a frequency looking for a room that would vibrate to it and then he would know he was the right kind of noise.

He sat on a bench and counted the number of steps it took for a gull to cross the path between the bins and the water’s edge, then multiplied that by something that didn’t exist to get a number that didn’t mean anything. He was not stupid. He was not simple. He was not just a man with a broken instrument inside him. He would have told you all of that, if you had asked him. He would have told you about grief like an engineer.

Four years ago—or five? his calendar had holes—there had been rain. There had been a hospital that smelled of lemon and bleach and the color green that medical people insist is calming. There had been a conversation about how you cannot have what you want even if you are good and have made your offerings to the terrible gods of ordinary life. There had been a hand letting go. Somebody had emailed him three days later to say that they had expected more from him, professionally. He had written back and said, I am sorry, and meant the sorry, though not in the way the email wanted. That sorry had burned its way out of him until all the little nerves at the edges of his mind were soot.

At twilight when the sky went violet at the edges and the towers drew their own light up through themselves like liquid, the city altered. It breathed more evenly. The men who hadn’t been seen during the day came out to sit on low walls and to talk. The women who had been seen all day continued to be seen, because that was what they were for, apparently. Cesar stood at a corner and made one of his noises at a woman who was late to meet someone. She kept walking. He laughed because she did it so beautifully, the not noticing. He turned his head, and a small camera on a corner blinked a red light at him. He turned his other head, the one people don’t see, and that camera blinked too, because so many corners held so many eyes. He made a note of where he would not go tomorrow. He didn’t know who he was hiding from. He thought it was cops. The word Parkour was chalked on a wall. He read it as if it meant something else.

Sergeant Morpurgo found him because Rasha thought to check the way the sea reflected in the glass of a building nobody could afford to enter, and in that reflection you could sometimes see what chose not to be seen. It was mostly a trick of light and angle, Rasha said, but also it was a habit you could learn, the habit of looking at the place the city wasn’t using right now. If there was an absence, something would fill it. If there was a silence, it had a shape.

He was visible there. He was holding a paper bag with a bread roll inside and he lifted it to his mouth with that carefulness that had nothing to do with being educated and everything to do with being the sort of person who could break things without meaning to. He ate. He blinked. He put the bag back down and looked out at the water with a look that had in it a small clean hate. It wasn’t for anybody in particular. Hate was an organ system too.

“Go,” Rasha said. “You wanted first.”

“Not like a prize,” Morpurgo said, and went.

He saw her before she spoke, which offended her slightly because she liked to arrive in a room in a particular purposeful way and be recognized only after she chose to be. But he saw her. He did not do the sound at her; he did not smile. He did that strange lifted-hand half blessing, which made her think of a photograph of a young pope. She didn’t like thinking about that. She preferred thinking about machines.

“Mr. Cesar,” she said. “Sergeant Morpurgo.”

He looked at her chest. He looked at her face. He looked just past her shoulder. He had the blank careful look of a man attempting not to say that he has no idea why he’s being addressed this way by a stranger who has put her feet in an angle that means official.

“I’d like to talk about what you’ve been doing,” she said, and watched his mouth to see if he’d twitch.

“What have I been doing.”

“Mocking in a physical way. Harassment. The committee thinks so.”

“What do you think.”

“I think you’re using a noise like a knife, and laughing like a bandage.”

He laughed then, but it wasn’t at her. It was at the metaphor. It was because it was almost exactly right and almost made him want to weep. “Why do you care,” he said.

“I teach people how not to build cities that make people into this.”

“I am not a city.”

“You’re a symptom.”

“I am a masterpiece,” he said, and said it with a sudden lightness that was not quite camp and not quite clear. “Let me ask you—if I stood quietly next to a woman and breathed near her, would you arrest me.”

“I’m not here to arrest anybody.”

“I mean your kind. The kind that asks me my name politely and then goes back to the office and writes it in a form in the box marked DANGEROUS.”

She tried not to like him. It’s unhelpful to empathize with the people the committee tells you to gently crush. Empathy makes for poor policy and worse writing. She liked him anyway, in the way that you like a glitch in a piece of music you’ve heard a thousand times. A wrong note that is more interesting than any of the right ones.

“I came to ask you to stop,” she said.

“Stop doing what.”

“Using your breath in a way that erodes other people’s ability to be people.”

“Ah,” he said. “Ah, yes.”

He looked past her and did the thing. There were three women approaching, two older, one younger. He watched the youngest with a look that was not sexual, and not clean either. He stepped to the side so he could be close when she passed, and he blew the soft motorboat noise at her cheek with the casualness of a person picking lint from a friend’s shoulder. She flinched. She kept going. She shook her head and then shook it again because she didn’t want the flinch to be the last thing she did in the gesture.

Morpurgo took a breath and then all at once she stepped into his space the way a dancer does, so that suddenly they were face to face and anyone watching would say that something had just happened, even if they didn’t know what. “I said stop,” she said. She didn’t raise her voice. She had trained her voice not to need elevation.

He smiled at her and it was more gentle than anything he had done so far. “You can’t ask me to stop. Not unless you’re going to ask the city to stop being the sort of place where men like me are made,” he said. “And the city will look at you and say, Oh child, I am exactly as I am supposed to be. I am perfection in concrete form. I am harmful by design and you, you—” He tilted his head. “—you can only adjust the margins,” he said, and laughed, softly. It was a poor laugh. It had gone brittle. He lifted his hand and almost touched the air near her face and then changed his mind and lifted it instead to pat his own chest, twice. An odd beat.

She noticed the way he moved and filed it in the cabinet she kept labeled wrong and useful. Something about the timing, the way he seemed to stutter exactly on the beat and then correct, like a dancer hearing the music in a different time signature. There was a rhythm close under his skin and she could almost hear it. Rasha, watching from a distance, felt something like the way you feel when a fluorescent light starts to go.

“You’re mourning someone,” she said.

“Yes,” he said. He didn’t ask her how she knew. “It makes me better at being awful.”

“Very often,” she said. She thought of saying me too but decided she didn’t want to toss her grief into the conversation like a coin into a fountain where the pennies go green. She didn’t like the color green in that way. “Will you come and talk to the committee with me.”

“No,” he said. “But I’ll talk to you.”

“Here.”

“Here.” He sat down on the bench and patted the space next to him like he was inviting her to join him in a new sin. She stayed standing because the measure of a person’s control sometimes looks like nothing more than where they put their body. He waited. The sunset waited too, wobbling slightly and then deciding to go ahead and happen.

“Why women,” she asked.

“Because women,” he said. “Because I don’t like the way they look at me like I am a fact inside their day. I want to be an interruption. A man can’t be an interruption to another man. That’s not how we’re trained. Maybe that’s stupid. All the stupid things are also true, did you know.”

“Yes.”

“And if I do it to men nobody films it. And nobody watches the film. And nobody cares.”

“You’re trying to be seen.”

“I want to be seen exactly enough and too much.”

“That’s an old problem,” she said. “We could give you a stage.”

“I don’t act,” he said, and did that little lift of his hand, useless and precise. “I laugh.” He looked at her long, his eyes staying at her face, his mouth still, his breath dry. He said, “You don’t like that I don’t sweat. You don’t like that the laugh doesn’t pick up my throat.”

“I don’t like many things about you.”

“That one you don’t like specifically,” he said. “That is a specific dislike. It’s a professional one.” He lifted his chin. In the second before a plane passes overhead and wipes the sound clean, she heard it—the faintest ticking under his voice, a pacing device, a metronome pretending to be a nerve. The sound a clock makes when it thinks nobody is listening.

“Where do you live,” she asked.

“I live where the noise goes at night,” he said. “I live in the corners of the city, in the between places, in the vents and the chimneys and the blind arcades. I live here,” he said, and tapped his chest with his knuckles. A hollow sound. Or not hollow. Something not quite hollow, not quite full.

He stood up. He was taller than she had expected when they were seated, but that’s always true of people when they stand up, and she forgave herself the cliché. Rasha had come closer without meaning to. The light drew a stripe across his face so it looked like he’d been cut in half and set together again wrong.

“I will walk with you,” he said to the women passing. They shook their heads. “I will walk with you,” he said to Morpurgo. She shrugged, which was a yes. He walked beside her and did not make any sounds at all, not even the small inadvertent ones human bodies make when they carry themselves in public. The quiet was too quiet. He had clipped his heels off the ground so there was no click on the stone. He was almost floating, a half inch of deliberate. He took pains to be unremarkable. He succeeded only a little.

She brought him to a coffee shop that tried to make you believe in a city you could touch with your hands and hold. Wooden tables. Clay cups. A barista who knew everybody by a name nobody else used publicly. She settled into a chair and handed him a cup, and he looked at it like it had a map on it and he was trying to decide whether to trust the map’s cartographer.

“What do you want,” she asked.

“What everybody does,” he said. “But that’s a trick answer. It proves nothing. It’s a way to hide under a blanket labeled Human.”

“We can do better than that.”

He leaned across his chair toward her. He was close enough that if he had made his sound she would have felt it like a hand. He didn’t. He licked his lower lip. “I want the city to hum at my frequency,” he said. “I want to make a sound and have the buildings ring. I want women to look at me like a problem they can’t solve and like that maybe means I am interesting.”

“You are a problem we can solve,” she said.

“That’s the saddest thing you’ve said,” he said, and smiled so that the skin near his eyes moved too slowly, smoothing too quickly after. He drank the coffee like medicine. He set the cup down with both hands, careful careful. “Who sent you.”

“The Bureau. A committee. A form with a heartbeat.”

“You’re not going to arrest me.”

“No.”

“You’re going to try to stop me, though.”

“Yes.”

“How.”

“I haven’t decided yet,” she said. “I thought we could start with deciding what it is you’re doing. Do we call it violence. Some people say that breath is nothing. That reaction belongs to the person who has it.”

“And you.”

“I don’t think that’s honest.”

“Honesty is an overrated virtue,” he said, and laughed, softly.

“Do you remember the first time,” she asked. “The very first one. The start.”

He tilted his head and the light slid over his cheek. He looked at the ceiling. He looked at the table. He looked at his knuckles. He said, “In the hospital. In a room where someone had died and gone on not dying, which is to say the machines kept doing their small polite work. The nurses ignored me because they had work to do that mattered and I did not. A woman walked past with a chart and a pen stuck in her hair and I wanted to break the world with the smallest thing I had. I wanted to mark it. Mark her. Not hurt her. Just put a sign down that said: Look. There was a life. It is gone. You must now live in a world without it. And because we have no rituals at hand we have to invent them. That was mine. And then it found a shape that was easier to carry.”

“The shape of a raspberry.”

“Yes,” he said. “The shape of contempt disguised as play.”

“Whose contempt.”

“All of ours,” he said. “Mostly mine.”

She didn’t argue. She didn’t point out that a ritual can be private. That there are ways to mark your hurt that do not involve damaging other people’s air. She did not because he knew it. She recognized the look of someone who knew all the ethical frames and had decided to walk around them anyway.

Rasha came in, sat, placed her palm on the table flat, a sign. “They want an answer,” she said. “The Bureau,” she meant. “They want a timetable. They want to know what options are on the table, off the table. They’ve got people calling who want arrests and also cuts in funding and also a public statement about how women shouldn’t be harassed in public places and also they want to know if we can call it something else, because harassment, you know, the legal definition, it gets in the way.”

“Of what,” Cesar said.

“Of pretending we can do nothing,” Rasha said. “Which is the favorite pastime of men who want to do something that would get them in trouble.”

“You’re sharp,” he said.

“I’m bored,” she said. “That looks the same at certain angles.”

He leaned back and the chair groaned. He looked like a painting someone had made with a palette that had run out of skin. He lifted his hand, lowered it. A small lag. She swallowed a thought that felt dangerous. She tamped it down, like a cigarette in sand.

“Do you remember the city before the cameras,” he asked, unexpected. “Do you remember walking through a plaza and seeing only the eyes of people looking at you, and no eyes set into steel and plastic. Do you remember not being filmed when you bought a loaf of bread.”

“I remember,” she said. “I don’t miss it.”

He laughed. He reached across and touched the bone of his own wrist like he was reading it. Tap tap. A rhythm set. She thought of the line in a manual she had once read that she had laughed at and then remembered later with a colder face: The device will calibrate to the environment gradually; allow up to twelve hours for the device to normalize. He looked normal now. He looked as if he had always been here. She felt a prudence settle in her like a dog circling a mat.

They parted at the coffee shop door. He went left without looking back. She watched him for the distance it took to pass four windows and then followed the shape of him in the reflection when he turned invisible at the corner. She didn’t think about the photograph in a folder with a different boy on a different day, with a different smell in the hospital corridor, with a different hand on the gurney than the one in the video. She thought about the committees and how they like their solutions to be clean. She thought, This won’t be.

That night the city put one of its small storms through. A wall of dust that arrived like an apology no one meant. The air went saffron and then beige and then dark. A woman on her balcony took her plants inside in the wrong order, the thrilled one then the shy one, when anyone knows it should be the shy one first. A man took a photograph of a streetlight and sent it to nobody in particular. Thunder cracked and then got bored. Rami pressed his face to a screen and watched a new clip of the man whose sounds had become the city’s lowest joke. In the clip, the man’s face was lit from the side like he was almost an advertisement for something you couldn’t afford. The comments were a river of solid gold hate. Rami scrolled through, trying to find a comment that wasn’t either condemnation or celebration. He found one that was just the letter V on its own, and loved it for a second without knowing why.

When morning came, the committee called. The committee was nine throats in one phone. It said please and it said also and it said yes but. It said the lawyer thought maybe there was a way to phrase this as an actionable disturbance, but maybe not, because jurisprudence was a cat that didn’t come when you called. It said the city had a shape and this man had taken a chisel to it. It said a hundred things. Sergeant Morpurgo held the phone to her cheek and watched her face in the mirror of her office window and moved her mouth in a way that meant all of those things could be true and also she could say no in a tone that took the air out of a room.

“I will talk to him again,” she said. “I will give you a plan that does not end in bars.”

What about fines, said one of the throats, because fines are the cotton underwear of punishment.

“What about a conversation,” she said.

People don’t like conversations, said the throat, because conversations take time.

“We have time,” she lied, and hung up.

She slept on a couch for twenty minutes in her office with the door cracked and her shoes off and the light like water behind her eyelids. In the sleep she had a dream in which all the small devices on all the people in the city beeped in sync, once, a long pure tone like a fork struck against a glass. The dream woke her with a start because it felt like a memory. Sometimes in this life the wire that carries the past gets crossed with the one that carries the next day.

Cesar went to a pharmacy and bought scissors and a pair of socks and nothing that a pharmacist could use to guess what kind of person he was. He took the socks out of their plastic with his teeth on the step outside and put them on over the socks he was already wearing. He moved through the day like a man with a very delicate instrument tucked under his tongue and he didn’t dare let it fall out.

He passed girls who laughed and he wanted to make the sound at them and didn’t. He passed women who didn’t see him and he made the sound at their backs. He passed a mother with a baby and he swallowed his breath and he felt like he would explode and then he didn’t explode and instead a small thought popped in his brain like bubble wrap. It said: you know what you are. He shook his head like a dog at the beach. He did not want to know. He wanted to be a man, just that, and not any more complicated object. He had made himself small to fit into the word, and smaller still, and then the word had shrunk too and here he was.

He went to the place that sold spare parts for appliances and asked for a thing that had a pretty name with s’s in it. The man at the counter looked at him and at the hands he didn’t hide and gave him a box. The box had in it a coil and a tiny booklet filled with diagrams of what looked like cities.

He carried the box to a bench and opened it the way a person opens a letter they think might contain the news that someone they love is alive. He tilted the coil in his palms and felt inside it a faint, familiar pulse. He smiled. He smoothed the small hairs on his wrist with his other thumb. He thought of a night when the moon had been a hard coin and he had walked until the soles of his feet had gone hot and numb with the unrolled heat of the city’s dark.

He was not careful enough. He looked up too late and there was Rasha, again, which was becoming a pattern, and after her, slow and deliberate, Sergeant Morpurgo. He realized then that although he had done this a hundred times in his mind, he had not decided what to do when the second day came and the same woman was still looking at him like a solution she had not yet tried.

“What’s in the box,” Rasha said, not unkindly. As if she would help him hold it if he asked.

“A coil,” he said.

“For.”

“A fan,” he said, and smiled. “I overheat,” he said.

“Do you,” said Morpurgo.

“Don’t you,” he said back.

She stepped closer and he felt the little organs inside him—whatever they were—shift their attention to her. He thought it was funny that a person could have attention tucked into their ribs. “Do you get tired,” she asked.

“Yes,” he said.

“Do you sleep.”

“Yes,” he lied.

“There are easier ways to be seen,” she said.

“I am past the easy ways.”

“Nevertheless,” she said. She didn’t like the box. It made a small sound. Everything about him had a small sound in it if you stood near enough. She wondered if anyone else had noticed. She hoped nobody else would. She had no good reason for hoping that.

He said, “She would have laughed at this. She would have hated it. She would have told me to stand still until the desire to break things passed.”

“What would you have told her,” Rasha asked. “In reply.”

“I would have told her that I don’t break things. I remind people that they are breakable,” he said. “I am a kindness in a mean coat.”

“Take it off then,” Morpurgo said.

“I can’t,” he said.

“You can,” she said, like a tight rope.

He put the box down on the bench. He put his hands on his knees. He leaned forward until his head was low and he breathed, and the breath sounded exactly like air. Then he raised his head and if anyone had been watching for it, they might have seen a small refocusing of him, a shutter click. He said, “Ask your questions.”

She thought of the list she had written in a notebook that she had torn out and crumpled and put back in her coat pocket. She could feel it now, against her chest, a little oracle that wanted to be unfolded. She didn’t take it out. She said, “Who taught you.”

“No one. And everyone. The way you are taught by being alive.”

“You’re very sure of yourself,” she said.

“I’m very hollow,” he said. “It sounds like certainty.”

“What do you love,” Rasha asked.

He looked surprised. Then he looked bored, which was a more honest reaction. Then he looked at his hands like the answer might be written there in a language only he could read. “I loved someone who is dead,” he said. “I loved the flicker of the television at four in the morning when I couldn’t sleep. I loved ice in water and the way the glass sweats. I loved the sound of the old metro, the one before they made it look like something a prince would ride. I love a street that curves in a way that suggests somebody made a mistake and then decided the mistake was better than the plan. I love laughing,” he said, and when he said it it sounded like he meant a different laugh than the one he had made their lives about.

She listened. She listened past him, to the city unfolding its afternoon like a map that got bigger the more you looked at it. She listened to the hum under his voice again and could almost name the frequency. She did not. She did not want to. Not yet.

“Walk with me,” she said at last.

“Where.”

“To where you did the first one. To the errand you turned into a rite.”

They went to the hospital. The hall smelled like the color green again. The woman at the desk asked them who they were. Morpurgo named herself in both halves, Sergeant and Professor, and watched the woman decide to accept both. Cesar kept his hands in his pockets so that he would not lift them. He was a man who had learned that the shape of his hands in the air was in itself a sort of offense, even before you did anything with them.

They stood outside the room where, when it had happened, he had been a person with a different face. The bed inside was occupied by a man with tubes and a chart written in a hand that was almost a picture. There was a plant on the window sill with leaves like little green coins. Everything was different. Everything was the same. He lifted his chin. He did not make any sound at all. He could feel the sound start up in him like an engine and he put his palm down flat on the door frame and pressed. He counted to twenty in a language that made his mouth move differently. He let the engine quiet. He blew out his breath through his nose and the hairs there tickled and he hated the sensation and loved that he could hate it.

“Okay,” he said. “Okay.”

She watched him like she had homework. Rasha watched them both like people are more interesting if you look at them as if they are a system and a song.

“Would you stop if I asked you,” she said, in the place where a million small sorries had been spoken whether they were meant or not.

“You’re not the first person to ask,” he said.

“I’m asking like this,” she said, and stepped close enough that his coat brushed her shirt. He did not step back. The fluorescent light above them flickered with that small headache sound. “I’m asking because I want you to allow me to say I convinced you. Not the committee. Not the law. Not the city. Me. Between us.”

“That would be a lie worth telling,” he said, and looked at her mouth. He didn’t mean it in the way that men mean it when they look at a mouth like that. He meant it the way a person might look at a door. “And I like good lies,” he said.

“Then let’s be allies in this lie,” she said.

He wanted to. He didn’t. He wanted to. He didn’t. He said, “I will not do it today,” and had the ridiculous feeling that he had given her a gift. He had. It wasn’t enough. It would do, for now.

They left the hospital. Outside, the air was clean on the face of it. A child ran ahead of a mother with a toy plane and yelled that he had made the moon. A man on a bench wiped his hand over his forehead to catch the sweat and then rubbed it on his trousers with a patience that implied practice.

“You could help us,” Morpurgo said. “There are better things to do with that laugh.”

“I’m not a circus,” he said.

“No,” she said. “You’re an instrument. You could learn a different song.”

“Will you teach me.”

“Yes,” she said, which surprised both of them.

He nodded. He began to walk away. Rasha exhaled. She had not realized she had been holding her breath. She watched him go with the look of someone who loved a puzzle and also was old enough to know that some puzzles want to be puzzles more than they want to be solved.

That night, in her apartment that faced a construction site where men worked with lights and music until the law told them to go home and they did not go home, Morpurgo lay on the floor on her back and stared at the white ceiling. She thought and did not think. She counted her own heart until it did a strange small stutter and she decided that was an illusion and also took a note of it on the inside of her eyelid. She remembered what it had felt like to say yes to a question nobody had asked her yet. She thought: there is something here that will change the room when the door opens. She thought: listen.

Cesar slept in the way a person benches in a park sleeps—with one eye and one ear and everything else arranged against loss. He dreamed in a simple repetitive way, like a looped clip. He woke before the loop figured out how to end itself. He put his hand on his chest and felt something steady there. He didn’t trust it. He stood up. He blew a soft little sound into the empty night, just to keep in practice, the way a singer warms up, the way a liar tries out the shape of a phrase. He didn’t laugh. He didn’t need to. Not yet.In the morning the city acted clean for a while, the way a child behaves for the first ten minutes at a relative’s house before the sugar and the boredom do their work. The storm had scoured the sky hard and flat, and the sun laid itself down on the roofs like a sheet of tin. The campus looked practical, as if all its curving gestures could be squared if you had the right tool. Sergeant Morpurgo opened her office windows even though the filters were already handling the air, because she preferred the pretense of breeze to the sound of machines pretending to be weather. On her desk the committee’s messages nested themselves into each other like spoons, shiny and identical if you didn’t look close. She read the words and felt them slide off her mind like water off oil, and then she read them again and they stuck. We would like a deliverable. We would like a timeline. We would like to understand your theory of change and also what you will do if the theory proves insufficient. She wrote a sentence and deleted it and wrote another and kept that one because it was both true and a shape the committee could recognize: We will attempt to retune a behavior by building a different audience for it.

Rasha arrived with two coffees and the kind of face a person has on the day they decide they will stop giving a certain kind of person the benefit of the doubt. She set the cups down and rolled back her sleeves and set her phone on its face so it wouldn’t chirp at her with the social obligations of other people’s emergencies. She did not ask for instructions, because she knew already what needed to be done in the first hour of a plan that was mostly ethics and only slightly logistics. They listed people who would answer their calls. They drew a map on the back of a flyer where a concert had been advertised in a font that made promises about joy. They talked about permission in a register that was almost liturgical. They talked about how to build a room where none of this would be a surprise, where bodies could be recognized before they were asked to perform not being hurt.

“You want to build a chorus,” Rasha said, after twenty practical minutes had softened into two speculative ones. She had pulled her scarf off and it lay across the back of a chair like a flag.

“I want to see what happens when a sound meets a sound of equal size but different intention,” said Morpurgo. She tried the sentence on her tongue and found it too large, and kept it anyway. “I want him to see what it is to be met.”

“He’s been met,” Rasha said, and made a small face. “But fine. Met like that,” she added, and the gesture she made with her fingers was as precise as a compass setting.

They made calls, and sent messages in ways that meant the recipients could choose to answer later or not at all without this choice itself becoming a second obligation. They used the names of women who were sometimes called when the city wanted to show it had asked women to speak. They didn’t use the names of women who had already done this calling and been worn down to a small hard seed of anger that still glowed but didn’t want to do this work anymore, not for free. They asked for an hour and a room and a promise that they could leave at the first discernible sign of harm and not have to explain it.

At the same time, in a different corner of the day, Rami took a bus he did not usually take because he had decided to be late on purpose to something that didn’t matter so that something else could happen at a corner he had marked in his head. He had studied the clips not like a fan but like a student; he had found the pattern in a stroll that tried very hard to seem patternless. He had told nobody. He had tried to tell his mother and then realized she did not need this story in her day, which was already full of men she avoided and machines that could hurt and the small betrayals of her body when it was tired before it had earned the right to be. He had told his friend a joke about a man who farted at the wrong time and had watched the friend laugh in the way boys laugh when they are being good at being boys. He had not told the truth out loud, which was that he wanted to see what the sound was, exactly, when you were standing in it, not at the safe angle of a camera. He said the word science to himself and felt it harden into a permission.

The bus’s air conditioner fought the outside in a brave and losing campaign and left a damp on the window that his finger wrote on and then wiped away. He got off three stops before he needed to and took the long way because the long way loops and in loops patterns show themselves if they’re there to be seen. He stopped at a stall with belts and bought nothing and listened. He passed a woman in a coat she did not need in this weather because she needed a coat as a sentence that read I am not here to be read. He saw a pigeon with three toes on one foot and two on the other, doing its sums. He found the corner and sat on a short wall and ate an orange in careful quarters and left the peel under the bench in a shape that made sense only to him. He waited.

Cesar did not choose his route so much as he allowed himself to be pulled along by all the small magnets that desire and habit and fear can fix under the skin, and yet if you had mapped his mornings you could have drawn a line between his feet and the places where women were obliged to run errands. He walked to places like pharmacies and schools and the teller machines that spit cash like a magician who only knows one trick. He kept his hands in his pockets because hands are the part the cameras understand best. He did not laugh at a billboard of a woman in a dress whose purpose was to be an equation between skin and expense, and he did not know why except that it seemed too easy and his laughs liked friction.

As he turned the corner where Rami waited, his rhythm faltered the way a person’s rhythm falters when a song has a beat in a new place and the body reaches for it and then misses by a fraction and then finds it. He felt the small click inside him he had come to recognize as the moment when the city tried to make him into a dot of data and failed for a half second and then succeeded again. He saw the boy sitting like a person on a stakeout who does not yet know he is on a stakeout. He saw the woman with the coat and the sentence under it. He saw a mother with a stroller that squealed because someone had not oiled the wheel. He felt the engine in his chest remember itself. He chose, not in a kind way and not in an entirely unkind one, the mother with the squeal, because the squeal put a rhythm under her walk and his sound liked a rhythm it could use as a ladder.

He lifted his chin and that was when the tap on his shoulder came, not hard, not gentle, as exact as a librarian at closing time. He turned and there was a woman he had never seen holding a set of keys like a rosary, and she looked at him with a face that knew how to be polite for a living and had recently decided that politeness owed nobody anything. She said, in a voice that was the same pitch as the squeal of the stroller but steadier, “If you do that to me I will scream and the scream will not be for you but it will fill your ears anyway,” and then she turned and walked on and did not look back. He stood and felt, for the length of time it takes a bus to come to a stop and sigh, that he was the person someone else had interrupted in the story. It was not a feeling he liked. He made a small noise without intending to, at nothing, and Rami heard it and felt his heart jump the way it does when a song hits the note that makes your ribs vibrate.

In the afternoon the room filled exactly the way rooms do when you are trying to gather something you can’t quite name. Chairs scraped in the way of chairs under fluorescent lights. Carafes of water did their earnest work on the table. The women came and put their bags where they could look at them and sat with their weight in the back of the chair until the room proved itself and then shifted so the backs held them. Rasha made the sort of welcome that was not a speech and not a ritual and not a pledge and contained a little element of each. She said who they were and who they were not. She pointed out the door and the windows and the way to the toilets because people relax when they know how to leave. She said the word consent and did not make it sound like paperwork. She said the word harm and did not make it sound like an accusation. She handed the room to Sergeant Morpurgo with the gesture of someone passing a bowl full of something hot that must not be spilled.

Morpurgo told them the story in a version that had none of the gossip and all of the gravity, and they did not need her to fill in the gaps. They had their own footage filed in their muscles. She spoke about what a city does when it fails to make room on purpose and then the room must be taken by an improvisation nobody asked for. She spoke about air as a commons and about noise as a right and a weapon, and she did not pretend to be neutral, because she had promised herself long ago that neutral was a bad religion that too easily became an excuse. She said she wanted to build a practice, not a punishment. She said she wanted to hear what they did, individually, to continue being a self in public when someone else used the small instruments of harm.

The women talked and the talk was the sound of a field after rain when you put your ear to the dirt and it is alive with insects you cannot see. A teacher spoke about the performance of ignoring and the exhaustion of it, how her shoulders ached from the tension of pretending she had not felt a thing. A doctor spoke about how breath is a clinical thing in her day and a sacred thing in her night, and she resented both versions when they were twisted to make a stranger important. A woman who kept books for a chain of stores spoke about how she hummed under her breath, not loudly but precisely, a note in the throat that steadied her. A runner spoke about speed, about the way speed can be a prayer. A mother spoke about the scream the woman in the street had promised and how she did not want to have to use it and how she would, anyway, and how she hated that this screamed her voice into a file on a phone and then that file would live forever somewhere that was not her.

“What if,” Rasha said, when the stories had settled enough to see their outlines, “what if we built a hum. Not a scream. A hum that was only for those who chose to make it and that was not for him at all.” She put her hand to her own chest and made a sound that did not travel far, a sound that stayed in the bones. The room watched her throat and then watched her chest and then listened to themselves listening. “What if when he approaches, those who want to, hum. Not to cancel him, not to fight him, not to give him the dignity of being opposed, but to make a small room around themselves and the other women there with a note that says: our air, our terms.”

“Will it work,” the teacher said.

“I don’t know,” said Morpurgo, and smiled the way people smile when they discover a new muscle in the face that might be useful or dangerous. “But I know that if it does not, we stop. And if it does, we make sure it does not become a rule that other people use to tell you how to exist.”

They tried it, in the ugly beautiful room with its good acoustics and bad lighting, and the sound that rose was not pretty but it was honest. It sounded like the inside of a bus when the driver takes a corner too hard and everyone huffs at once. It sounded like a refrigerator in a hot apartment late at night reminding you that it keeps working whether you sleep or not. It sounded like an animal consoling itself. They practiced raising it together and lowering it together; they practiced letting it be a thing one person did alone that did not require the whole room to become other than it was. They laughed, real laughter, when someone’s hum slipped into a tune from an old cartoon. They argued, quickly and with care, about whether this was their work to do at all, and decided to do it anyway for the hour, because there is a difference between refusing the forced labor of surviving harm and refusing the experiments that keep you alive in a world where harm exists.

In a laboratory no student ever asked to borrow because the equipment inside it was old enough to be almost holy, Morpurgo stood with a key she borrowed from a caretaker who believed in her in the way quiet men sometimes decide to believe in their teachers when the world’s noise makes that seem like a small act of rebellion. The anechoic chamber held its own night; it was a room built to make a person hear themselves in the way that can feel like a betrayal and an illumination. She had not brought many people into it because it made them cry or lie, and she wasn’t interested in either response today. She had asked him to come and he came, which is itself a data point that makes certain arguments easier to win with committees and harder to win with yourself.

He took off his shoes without being asked when he saw the foam on the walls and the way the floor often tempts the soles to make more sound than they should. He looked up and down and outward and his face did the thing faces do in a room like this, which is to briefly forget the polite lines they hold for the world. She closed the door and the door closed the world, and the world did not know they were inside this particular silence, which is one of the gifts of an institution you can be angry at and use anyway.

“Stand there,” she said, and pointed. He stood and for a moment she saw him as a diagram in a book about physics, a stick figure standing in a field of arrows that measure forces you cannot see. She stood opposite, and the space between them was a machine waiting to be turned on. “Laugh,” she said.

He did it reflexively, the small breath-torn laugh that had become the half-signature of him, and in the chamber it landed on the floor with a soft thud and did not go anywhere because there was no anywhere to go. He blinked, surprised. He laughed again, the way a person pokes a thing they don’t believe is real, and again it stayed home. He watched his throat in his mind and his throat did not help him. He made the raspberry, soft, at a point in the air that had no face to offend, and in that room it sounded not like contempt and not like a taunt but like a child’s motor struggling to keep a paper boat afloat in a dish. He laughed again, harder, and the laugh broke, and in the break she heard what she had come for, the small clicking that lived under it as cleanly as bone under skin.

He heard it too and his eyes went wide in a way that looked, briefly, like fear. He looked at her and did not speak. She counted, not out loud, to the sixth beat and then to the seventh and found that the seventh had fat around it that did not belong to any heart’s logic she had studied in the books they want you to read before they let you touch the machines that keep people alive. She stepped closer, as if the thing could be heard more clearly at a hand’s breadth, and then she stepped back because she felt the politeness in her become a principle, and principles at short range can be rude.

“What did you put in yourself,” she said, and she said it like a person who knows the cost of adding a part to a human system.

He smiled a wide, foolish smile that looked like it wanted an umbrella. “Only what the city offered me,” he said, and waited to be admired for the line, and because she did not admire lines when they were trying to be clever and evasive at once, the smile sagged. “Nothing. Everything. I have a heart that forgot its work and then was reminded. I have a spine that has friends now. I have a pocket that hums,” he said, and tapped his chest as if there were indeed a pocket there for small change and batteries. “I have grief and it found something in me it could use,” he added, quietly. “Does that qualify as a device.”

“It does,” she said. “It qualifies.”

He looked at the wall and put his hand on it and felt the foam drink his heat. “Teach me,” he said, not because he had decided that this was the day to be good, but because he had decided that this was the day to be curious instead of clever. “You said you would teach me a different song.”

She took a breath and made the small, low hum she had asked the women to practice, and in the chamber it sounded like the architecture approving of itself. He watched her mouth and then closed his eyes, which made him look more like the man on the bench with the coil and less like the man at the platform with the poor laugh. He tried to lay his sound on top of hers and it skidded off, badly. He tried to lay it underneath and it stuck in a way that made his shoulders drop in a relief he had not been counting on. They did it for two minutes that felt like both ten and one, and during this time neither of them could remember a committee meeting or a clip online or the way a law sits in the belly of a building and waits to be invoked.

They came out of the room as people come out of rooms that make them into acoustics, blinking and a little ridiculous. The caretaker nodded at them from down the hall with a look that said he had known long ago that some rooms are more honest than others and that he was pleased that they had been honest in this one and would you please sign the log as well, he had to keep the log for reasons that had nothing to do with truth.

On the way out, Morpurgo’s phone did its bright little dance with the Bureau and she watched it the way a person watches a bird that keeps flinging itself at a window and cannot be convinced to stop. The nine throats had found a tenth and it said the word injunction with a certainty that tried to be warmth. It said public safety the way a person says bedtime to a toddler they do not want to anger. It said that a woman with an important name had been laughed at outside a building where cameras do more than watch. It said the city wanted to be seen doing something. It said the cotton underwear of punishment could become silk if the budget permitted. She said the word pilot into the phone like a captain about to land on a strip of road on a foggy day. She said the word consent again. She said an hour and a room had already existed and that the world had not ended and that perhaps they might wait before they put a word like injunction into a place where a word like experiment had a chance. They said they would consider it, which meant they would meet without her and decide it was almost time to consider it.

She and Rasha took him to a small restaurant where the owner had decided that decorating with wire baskets and black-and-white photographs meant his soup tasted better. He ate as if the food were a problem he could solve with patience and small bites; he drank water in sips and watched the door without making it obvious. He rested his wrists on the edge of the table the way a person does when they are keeping their hands in a place where everybody can see them. He told them a story about a cat with no tail who had decided to sit in the doorway of a shop selling wedding dresses and nap there every day from noon to three and how the brides tended to step over it with respect that bordered on worship. He told them a story about a train he had never taken but whose timetable he had memorized to the minute and the seconds and how the seconds were the part that made his breath feel like a coin rolling in a jar. He told them almost nothing useful and everything necessary, and when he lifted his hand to laugh the small machine in him thought about it and then decided to allow it.

The clip of him not doing it traveled quickly because novelty always gets to the party first. He stepped aside for a woman with a full cart and his mouth made a shape and then broke the habit like a bird that turns in air a fraction before a window. Someone wrote in the comments that perhaps he had found Jesus and someone else wrote that perhaps Jesus had found him and someone else wrote that religion is the noise the rich make when they are tired of paying taxes and someone else wrote simply an emoji of a kettle. The kettle made more sense than the rest to Rami, who watched the clip on the bus with a concentration that made the bus forget it had other people in it.

The other clip, the bad one, arrived just as quickly, because badness is efficient. He had done it to a woman whose husband wore a name on a badge under glass and liked to speak to cameras himself, and this meant that his behavior grew new branches that reached into rooms where policy is made by men who do not take buses. The committee sent three messages in an hour asking, politely at first and then with less of the costume of politeness on, for the plan, the deliverable, the conclusion to this story they had authorized to be put in motion. She wrote the same sentence three times and sent it three ways, and it said the hour had taught them something and that teaching takes more than an hour and that anybody who tells you a city can be fixed without a crack is selling something with a return policy that will be denied.

That night the test tone came, the clean note that had visited her dream and had felt like a memory. Every device in the city with a certain firmware and a certain obedience to certain servers made a long, even sound like a good knife sliding down a whetstone, and then they were quiet again. It was an emergency platform’s rehearsal, a way to prove to the world that the world could be spoken to. People laughed and filmed and posted, because laughter and filming and posting are the platitudes of our time, and the note nested among their notifications like a clean white egg in a bowl of keys. Cesar heard it and stopped walking because the note got inside the machine inside him and decided, for a fraction of a city’s blink, that the two were cousins. He put his hand on his chest and it did not help enough. He sat down on a step and looked, for a ridiculous second, at the sky, as if he might find the person who had pressed the button and ask them what they thought they were doing.

Rami had disliked the test tone when it came because it made his head feel like it had been wrapped in plastic and then unwrapped and then wrapped again. He was close enough to see Cesar stop and sit, and because he was a boy who had already decided that this story was also somehow his, he went toward him not quickly and not too slowly. He did not speak first. He sat on the step below with the careful modesty of a person who has been told all his life to take up less space. He looked at the man and at the place where the man’s hand had pressed his shirt and then looked away toward a sign with prices on it for things that have prices on them all over the world. He said, finally, in a voice that sounded like somebody had borrowed it from a book he had read twice, “I know what it feels like when a room makes a noise and you have to sit down.”

Cesar looked at him with the polite caution he reserved for boys, because boys are dangerous and he had once been a boy and had done dangerous things, and it made him careful about the category. He could not quite catch the boy’s eyes. He nodded like a man in a doorway nods to a delivery and says set it down there. “Do you,” he said, and his voice had a small new thread in it, a wobble where the device and the organ negotiated jurisdiction.

“My mother’s asthma,” Rami lied and did not lie, because he had heard his mother in the night struggling to turn air into something useful, and he had been asked by her to be still when he wanted to be helpful, and he had learned the geography of uselessness that way. “And my own head sometimes,” he added, which was nobody’s business, but here they were. “I can count for you if you want,” he said, and then felt ridiculous, as if he had offered a drink to the sea. “One, two,” he said, under his breath and then louder, “three, four,” and the cadence he chose was neither a march nor a lullaby, something in between that a person could walk to if their body needed a metronome but not an order. The count calmed nothing and everything, and it gave the city the seconds it needed to be ordinary again.

Rasha was the one who knew the shop in the souq where the woman who used to fix radios now fixed drones and hearing aids and the bright small toys of a generation whose games taste like electricity. She had learned about the shop the way you learn about everything that saves you in a city like this: because a friend of a friend once broke something in a place where breaking was expensive and a woman with hands like baking and welding had fixed it for the price of a story and a promise to send other interesting problems her way. The woman looked at Cesar the way mechanics look at engines that make noises at idle that do not belong to their model, not unkindly, not kindly, with interest straight as a cable.

She put him in a chair that had seen better days and those days had not been good ones either, and she set three tools on the bench not because she would use them but because people relax when they see tools and think the world runs on things that can be held. She did not ask him to take his shirt off because she was a person who could see and did not need to be rude to prove it. She asked him to breathe and then to not breathe and then to cough, which he could not do without laughing, and that made her smile. She asked him to hum and he shook his head and did it anyway and she heard the frequency in it the way a person who has lived with trains hears the difference between lines. She took a tuning fork from a drawer that was a museum of small metal promises and she struck it and held it near him and the fork did what tuning forks do when they meet their friends. She nodded, once. “It’s not standard,” she said, and the words hung in the air like a diagnosis without a name. “It wants to run hotter than you do.”

“Can you adjust it,” Rasha asked, the sort of question that is useful even if you know the answer because asking makes the room rearrange itself.

“I can teach him to hear it,” the woman said. “I can give it a cousin to talk to so it does not talk to itself all day in there. I can slow it a little. I cannot make it into a different thing than the thing it is,” she added, and looked at him as if she was sorry and as if she would not apologize for the limits of a physics that had kept her honest since the day she learned how to solder a wire without burning her fingertip. “I can tell you that if I slow it you will sleep once in a while and your laugh will not itch so much to get out of you. But it will not be the same laugh when it comes. There is always a cost and sometimes the cost is not paid in a currency you recognize until later.”

He looked at his hands, the prettiest and ugliest part of him, and then at Rasha as if she had a translation of this city that he had been using wrong, and then at Morpurgo, who had become, against his intention and possibly against hers, a fixed point on his map. He said, very quietly, in the voice he had once used to ask a woman in a hospital bed whether she wanted water or ice chips, “If I change it, I will be less of me.”

“If you do not change it, you will be more of what you are already,” the woman said, and because she did not like riddles she added, “Some days that will be good. Some days it will be the thing that makes a person cross a street when they see you so they can keep what they have left of their week.” She set the fork down gently, like a spoon on the lip of a pot that is about to boil. “It is yours,” she said. “I am old enough to know that this is what matters most.”

He nodded and moved his hand to his chest and let it hover there without touching. He did not say yes. He did not say no. He said, “Not today,” in the tone he had used at the hospital, and it was a terrible and useful decision. The woman shrugged, the shrug of a person who had watched things burn and dampen and be built again with both better and worse materials. She handed him a small device that looked like nothing and had cost her a morning ten years ago and three headaches and a bruise on her wrist. “When the city tests its alarms,” she said, “put this to your ear and listen like it is a song you do not hate. It will teach the thing in you not to follow right away, at least not always. It is not medicine. It is what we have.”

The plan got a name because the Bureau would not give them a slot on a calendar until a name could be pasted next to it. They called it the Chorus of Air because that sounded like art and policy at once, and also because any other name they tried either punched too hard or bent too soft. They promised the committee three sessions and a report that would not contain the formula anybody wanted but would contain the bones of a thing that could be turned into policy without hurting it first. They collected consent like a sacrament and wrote the terms in words a person’s aunt could read without getting tired. They set the room up with the chairs in a curve instead of rows, and somebody put a plant in a corner for no reason anyone could explain and it helped anyway.

He stood in front of the room like a terrible idea being given a chance and did not move his hands much. He did not demonstrate at first, because demonstration would have been assault dressed in pedagogy. He talked, which was not his favorite instrument, and in talking he built a place where he could be seen in a shape other than a clip. He said he could stop sometimes and not others and he did not always understand why. He said he had wanted to make a mark, to be a mark, and how stupid that had been, and how true. He said he had not known that his grief had given him an accent, and he was learning now to speak in a way that did not put the blame for his pronunciation on the listener.

The women listened the way women are taught to listen when the person speaking is a problem that might also be a person. They did not forgive him and they did not refuse to. They sat with the boredom of it and the interest, and when he made the small sound of breath that used to mean the thing was coming, half the room lifted their chins and hummed and a thing happened in the air that made the sound rearrange itself before it could arrive at a face. He took a step back and his mouth opened in a shape that had learned the room’s rule. He laughed then, a new laugh, unpracticed, ugly, kind, and he looked wounded by it and also relieved.

Between sessions they ate dates and cheese and bread and watched the coffee cool. A woman told him about her sister who had stopped going to the market not because of him but because of men like him and because of the way cameras make stories out of bodies that have not consented to be stories, and he did not offer her a remark. He listened to the way you stand still to be measured. Another woman told him she would not attend again because she did not want this to become her community service; she wanted to read a book in the evening without having to sing. He nodded like he had been told the date of a surgery and had written it down. Rasha collected notes as if they were shells she could return to the sea later without hurting the creatures who had lived in them.

When it ended, for that day, the committee would not have recognized the shape of the deliverable but a thing lay on the table that had not been there in the morning and it had the heft of a tool that could be picked up by the hand of policy without dropping it. In her report, which she did not send that night because she had learned the value of sleeping on a sentence before it was shared with men who liked to use sentences as hammers, Morpurgo wrote that harm could be dispersed by changing the acoustics of a room as well as by removing an actor from it, and that if the city understood itself not only as a grid and a set of walls but as an instrument, then the work of repair could sometimes be done with a retuning more elegantly than with a cut.

In the hour after the room emptied, the three of them stood in the doorway because people do that when they are reluctant to name the end of a thing. Cesar said nothing of substance and the women did not imagine he owed them a speech. Rasha put her scarf back on and pulled it snug and looked at the ceiling for no reason except that looking at the ceiling has saved her before. Morpurgo felt tired in her elbows and in the back of her mouth, the way you feel after you have said the right amount and not a word more. Outside, the light put itself on the sidewalk like a skin that would be lifted by night and placed somewhere safe. The city made a small test noise in one of its pipes far under the street and the three of them felt it, each in their private machine, and then, without needing to say so, they listened for what would happen next.The next morning wore its good shirt and its old stains, and the city performed being orderly with the fussy attentiveness of a host cleaning only the rooms guests would see. In offices with carpets that tried to muffle decisions, the Bureau scheduled a call with a lawyer whose hair looked like it had been combed with a rulebook, and he explained, carefully, how air could not yet be owned and therefore could not yet be defended, except when it could, which depended on context and on whether a camera loved you. He said ordinance with a tenderness that made Rasha mute her microphone and lay her forehead on the table the way a woman does when laughter would be disqualifying. Sergeant Morpurgo kept her face arranged into the neutral that wasn’t neutral and said that they were building a different response and she needed one week, which was actually three days, which was actually the remainder of the day and a night she had already given away.

She went from phone to classroom and taught the ethics of road design as if it were a poem about who is allowed to get home without having to forgive the city for its geometry. The students took notes in the way people in a desert drink water even when they are not thirsty, habit more than need, and she watched their pens move and thought about the shape of harm as it passes from a hand that knows it is doing harm to the air that looks innocent and then to a body that knows what air can do. She sent them away with a question about custody—who holds the responsibility for a thing that is everywhere—and watched them leave in a procession that contained both swagger and the small scrape of the soul that no one admits.

She met Rasha in the corridor, a corridor with art on the walls that tried to propose that certain shapes are universally calming, and Rasha had a look on her face that meant news. “They’ll go for a temporary order,” she said. “Not tonight. But before the week performs being over. The man with the badge-wife has friends and the word hazard is enjoying itself in their mouths.”

“Of course,” said Morpurgo. “We knew it would come to language. They will name it and by naming it lay claim. We can at least make sure the name does not swallow anything we need still to use.”

“Also,” said Rasha, and here she smiled in the way a person does when the world does something surprising and kind but messy, “the women in the room made a group. Not a chat. A group. It has a coffee calendar already and someone is compiling a shared playlist that is all songs with hum in them, literal and otherwise. You started a thing you can’t own.”

“Good,” said Morpurgo, and the word left her body like heat, like relief. “They will figure out what it is for before we can.”

Cesar woke with that prickly disorientation that comes when sleep has been more truce than restoration, and the first thing he did was put the small device the radio woman had given him up to his ear and wait for its polite little chime. It chined obediently, a sound like a spoon tapped against ceramic, and he felt the mechanism under his sternum not respond and then respond with a sulk that was almost adolescent, which made him laugh in a way that felt new. He ate bread without butter and drank water with a lemon in it he had not paid for and went out into the day with the careful courtesy of a man entering a church that is not his.

The market recalled him the way certain corners recall you because you’ve left something there, a quantity of life you did not mean to spend. He walked its lanes and let the noise of it try to decide him and refused to be decided, which is a skill not everyone has. He lifted his chin once, out of habit, and caught it in his own hand before the breath could become a tool, and he felt a private satisfaction that was not pride and not shame, which startled him because most of his feelings belonged to those two categories and had for a year. He stood near the woman with tangerines and asked for a bag and kept his eyes on the fruit, which glowed like coins in a myth, and he said, “Thank you,” in Arabic that he had learned a syllable at a time without a teacher, and she looked at him and then looked away and then looked back, which was a geography lesson he had forgotten existed.

He did two good hours and then the city made a noise—someone testing something in a basement far from where he stood—and he felt his chest pick up its head and turn toward it like a dog, and he had to sit on a crate and breathe through his teeth until the need to make himself known passed. He thought of the bench in the anechoic chamber and the way laughter behaves when the room has nowhere to put it. He thought of the women’s hum, the way it had been ugly and perfect, and he looked around to see if any of them were here, if any of them were tracing their day with the intention of being a choir, and he felt both relief and disappointment when he saw only strangers and one boy who was not a stranger at all if you counted attention as knowledge.

Rami had made himself into routine, a way of not looking too much like intention to an adult who might decide to move him along. He timed his arrival with a vendor’s habit of counting cash, and he let his body be still without becoming a statue, and he watched. He watched the way women walked and the ways their shoulders spoke, the ways people who love their bodies walk a place and the ways people who do not love their bodies try to be inside them anyway. He watched Cesar not doing it, which was a spectacle for a day and then not a spectacle at all, like everything. He had tried the hum at home in his room with his headphones on so his mother would not hear and ask and be tired, and he had been surprised by how ridiculous and soothing it was at once. He wanted to hum now, benevolently, experimentally, but the desire to do it felt too much like the desire to be part of the story, and he had promised himself he would not be that kind of boy today.

He watched the moment when a woman’s path bent toward the place where Cesar stood and he watched the small animal of anticipation move under the man’s skin and he watched the man get hold of the animal and put it in a box and latch the box and the woman pass, her air intact. He exhaled. He hadn’t known he had been withholding breath, and now that he had released it he felt briefly weepy, which annoyed him, and he bit the inside of his cheek and told himself he was being a scientist and scientists do not cry in markets while watching a man not be awful.

The Bureau announced, with social media graphics in a color that municipal designers believe implies mercy, a “Public Safety Consultation” on the matter of “Directed Airborne Harassment,” which was not yet a phrase but wanted to be, and citizens were invited to attend, to speak in two-minute increments, to present data in the form of anecdotes if necessary. The flyers made their quiet way into elevators and onto school bulletin boards and into chat groups where a woman might write, with half a laugh and a whole weariness, that she had been consulted before and received a rubber wristband in return. Rasha invited herself to the planning meeting where men in shirts explained how microphones would be set up and which angles would be more flattering to democracy, and she stood at the back and wrote a list of ways a room can hurt people without touching them. She left the list on the table like a tip and did not wait to see who pocketed it.

The night before the consultation, Morpurgo could not get her body to be quiet without trickery. She cleaned her stovetop, which had no more to give, and she folded towels into rectangles whose edges would not teach anyone anything, and she sat on the floor and put her forehead on her knees and counted until numbers lost their function. She had thought the day in the chamber would be the difficult thing. She had not accounted for the way the world asks you to narrate your attempt at repair in a syntax that was built to catalog blame. She slept at last like a person who has borrowed someone else’s dog and the dog has decided to lie on their feet and make a steady small sound the night can use as an anchor.

The consultation room had a mean carpet and kind chairs, a mismatch that put everyone at a mild disadvantage, which is not a terrible way to begin when you are dealing with people’s sense of themselves. The microphones had red rings that lit up when it was your turn to speak, which made the act of speaking into a performance with a built-in applause. In the second row sat a woman with a scarf who had opinions about how music should be mixed in public places and, beside her, a woman who had never given her opinion to a microphone and had promised herself she would this time if only to be able to go home and tell her niece that it was not so hard. In the back row sat two men who had written furious essays online about how the disease of soft policy was ruining everything, and they wore their identical black caps like a uniform and looked at each other for cues on when to snort. Near the front sat a man whose wife had been targeted by the laugh and who carried himself like a person who knows whose phone numbers ring on the first try.

Rasha and Morpurgo sat side by side with the shared stack of notes that indicated they trusted each other and did not need to perform separation to prove independence. The Bureau, delighted with being a host, rearranged the water bottles on the table twice and then again. Cesar did not sit in the room. He did not stand in the doorway. He did not watch from a phone. He sat in a cafe across the street and stared at a cup until a man asked him if he was all right, which is a kindness that costs two breaths and is rarer than it should be.

Speakers took the microphones and offered the city their little pieces of themselves, neatly labeled and wrapped in sentences. A woman described the taste of fear as metal and how she found herself cleaning her mouth with her tongue after, as if the air had left something behind. Another woman said she had not been bothered so she did not understand the fuss, which drew from the room the sound of the universe rearranging for one second and then deciding not to bother. A man said this was nothing compared to the pious men who police a hemline and a handshake and a laugh, and he got his two minutes and then ten seconds more because the man with the switch liked what he was saying and his thumb was slow. A student offered data, bless her, a small survey, error bars, the confidence of someone whose world still offers equations that match the weather. The man with the badge-wife spoke last, without asking, and the red ring lit because he had taken the microphone into his hand and kissed the switch in a way it liked, and he said safety twice and dignity three times and injunction once, and dignity remembered that it was not a word to be said out loud too often if you wanted it to keep its job.

When it was her turn, when Rasha lifted her face and pressed the button and the ring lit, she spoke clear and made herself complicate things in a way the room would have to carry for at least a bus ride after. She said that law is a poor instrument for sounds that live in the muscles, and that fines tend to find the poorest, and that bars satisfy a need for neatness more than they satisfy a need for repair. She said that the city’s machines had started making their own sounds—tests and rehearsals and pings—in a way that had consequences nobody was tracking, and that it was a mistake to speak about a man’s mouth without also speaking about the speakers on the light poles. She said she had a proposal for a pilot and that the pilot would not be enough and that this was not an apology for it. She said the word hum and let it sit in the microphone like a seed.

There is a way a room breathes when it decides to be kinder than you expected, and the room did that, briefly. Then the man in the black cap lifted his hand and made a speech about how not all men were anything and how he should be allowed to blow whatever sound he wanted into whatever air he could reach, and the microphone did its job and amplified his complaint into a kindness he did not intend. Morpurgo watched the two men with caps like they were a species and she was learning its habits, and she filed away their cadence and their chosen insults and the way they smiled at each other when a sentence landed like a punch. She spoke when the Bureau asked her to summarize in the tone you use with a child who needs to hear that they cannot have cake for dinner and yes you will still love them, and she said they would publish their plan and their observations and that nothing good would come of speed, and that they could have speed anyway if the Bureau needed it, but not the kind that becomes injury.

They left the room with that conference buzz that is neither relief nor despair, and outside the air was blunt with heat that had nowhere else to be. Cesar crossed the street without looking both ways because the traffic had learned him, and he fell into step at their side as if this had been arranged, though it had not, and they walked three in a stripe until the city narrowed and told them to walk two and then one and then stop, which they did, at a corner where the shade drew a square on the ground like a doormat.

“Do you want me to come to the next one,” he said, and the pronoun was slippery; it might have meant session or consultation or day.

“Want is an elastic word,” said Morpurgo. “I want less damage in the world. I want fewer devices accumulating inside bodies. I want the Bureau to forget the word injunction for a season. I want you to be without the hunger that thinks it is your shadow. In that stack, your attendance is light. But yes. Come.”

The second session was less beautiful and more useful than the first, which is what second sessions should always be. The women had slept on it and their bodies had recorded the experiment and produced opinions salted with the experience of walking through the city since then. One came angry in a way she could not explain and did not wish to apologize for, and she put the hum on like a bright coat and refused to take it off when the song ended, and everyone acquiesced because the coat looked right on her. Another cried for two minutes and then became a scientist for ten, listing variables as if she could unbuild the thing and build it again with better joints. A third said she had hummed in a grocery aisle when a man was simply too near and then had stopped herself and had instead turned and looked at him in the exact shape of the hum, and he had moved away, which could mean anything or it could mean that sometimes naming a thing to yourself out loud in your chest is enough to return your air to you.

Cesar stood where he had been told to stand and did not shape the room. He let the room shape him. He felt his mechanism try to take advantage and he hushed it, not with anger but with a story he told it about belonging to a choir, and it seemed to understand enough to wait. He tried the new laugh again, the one that belonged to nobody yet, and it still hurt him, but less, and he found he could do it without his mouth wanting control of somebody else’s breath. He listened to a woman explain that she liked to clench her jaw and open it like a door she had decided to oil, and he tried it and found himself surprised by how the click in his ear responded like a dog taught a trick.

Between the second and the third, the Bureau did what bureaucracies do when the narrative threatens to not include them; it produced a draft. The draft had sections, and the sections had numbers, and the numbers gave shape to a fear the way a frame gives shape to a painting that was fine before the frame. It proposed a Fine for Expulsive Sound Emission, and it distinguished between playful bananas with a child and hostile lip sounds with a stranger and asked a cop to tell the difference. It added a carve-out for “authorized theatrical performance,” which meant men in a building with tickets would be permitted to spit noise in women’s faces as long as the posters had the city’s logo on them. It suggested that devices be registered and that any mechanism that interacted with “public test tones” should be declared promptly, like a firearm or, in an earlier age, a foreign book. It used the word calibration in a way that made the engineer in Rasha want to throw a shoe.

“What will they do,” asked the radio woman when Rasha brought her the draft, which arrived in the kind of email that blinks twice when you open it, the better to be noticed. She had a soldering iron in her hand and a pair of reading glasses on her nose that made her look severe and kind at the same time if you were standing exactly where Rasha stood. “Check our chests at checkpoints. Tap a fork and listen for what you keep in there.”

“They will ask us to do their listening,” said Rasha. “Then they will forget to hear. And yet. We cannot let them guess alone. Guessing alone is how men build barbed wire.”

Cesar brought the draft to the cafe where he measured the day, and he read it backwards, which was a habit he had when he suspected that a thing had been written to make him agree before he had a chance to disagree. Reading backwards made the sentences behave, sometimes. He got to the end where it said Public Safety is our collective enterprise and he wanted to underline the word collective and ask it whether it had ever been to this city on a Thursday. He got to the part where it said the laugh and he smiled because they had not used the word, not precisely, and that felt like a small mercy they had not intended. He put the paper down and stared at the window until his eyes found his reflection and he told himself he looked better when he didn’t move.

The incident came on a Friday when the light leaned hard and the men who did not have the week off pretended for two hours that they did. It came not because the world requires drama to advance a plot but because systems find each other eventually; the last thread goes through the last eye of the last needle and then a seam is inevitable. At the station where the old metro nodded to the new one because it had no choice, a group of men with caps and phones and slogans had decided to perform an objection in the style of men who feel their perimeters have been nudged. They had printed signs in a font that mistakes bluntness for clarity and they had brought a portable speaker that could make a human voice into a god or a mosquito depending on the distance. Their plan was a chorus of raspberries, and they practiced, and in practicing made each other ridiculous and thus more determined to be important.

Women arrived as women must arrive at the world: to go somewhere else, to carry groceries, to be late, to be early, to buckles and rings and lunches, and they saw the men and, because habit is a survival skill, they changed their route or they changed their posture or they did not change anything and did not forgive themselves later for not changing it. A woman with a scarf saw the caps and felt a little earthquake inside her and put one hand to her throat because sometimes you need to feel a bone. A woman in a yellow dress saw the signs and wanted to sit down, not because she was afraid but because she was bored to the edge of her patience by the problem of men inventing new shapes for old noise.

Morpurgo and Rasha were there because somebody had sent a message that contained a link that contained a threat that contained an opportunity. Rami was there because school had let out and his feet had ideas that were not homework. The radio woman was there because she had soldered too long and needed air, which is a joke on certain days. A boy with a skateboard was there because his hands wanted to learn a new thing and tricks live where police are not yet looking up.

The men began. Their leader, the taller of the twins in purpose if not in blood, lifted his chin and blew and the sound, magnified by machines, came out of the speaker like a chorus of children being forced to be rude. The crowd made the sound a little bigger with laughter and displeasure, which are cousins in a square. A woman flinched and did not flinch again and a second woman put her hand to her chest and made the hum and then put it down and looked at her friend and they both hummed and then did not. The men blew again and this time there were thirty small responses in the crowd, thirty private frequencies, and the air began to feel like a busy intersection with no lights.

Cesar felt the first wave hit the mechanism and he held himself still. He stood on the periphery, both witness and archive, and he put his palm to his sternum like a saint in a painting and he told the thing to wait. A civic alarm test went off somewhere far, too far, but the signal understood distance less than it understood obedience, and the first clean tone nested like a needle in the noise. For a second the station sounded like a factory that has been repurposed for art, and people looked up like they always do when the world decides to sing at them without asking.

The crowd tilted. A child cried in the way children cry when a sound climbs their spine and tickles the brain. A policeman in a uniform that fit better than most hesitated because he had not been trained for frequencies as a form of protest and because he had come here prepared to move bodies, not air. The men blew a third time and their leader raised his hand like a preacher and the portable speaker protested with feedback and in the complaint of the machine a crack appeared, an opening, a moment where the sound was less sure of itself than it had been.

“Now,” said Rasha, but she did not yell. She did not command. She made the hum, low and steady, and she felt it in her bones and not in her throat, and the women who had come to be a choir and the women who had come to ride a train felt the invitation reach them and each decided, yes or no, in the second a train takes to brush a platform with its wind. The hum rose not like a wave and not like a wall; it rose like a scaffold, each piece supporting another, and it did not go anywhere except into the bodies that made it. It did not meet the men’s noise like an opponent to a duel. It folded itself into the women’s coats and hair and ribs and made a room where the raspberries could not live without permission.

Cesar laughed, once, and the laugh was neither an attack nor a defense, it was simply a pressure valve, and the chest-device let it pass because the hum had made it irrelevant. He moved toward the boy with the skateboard and said, “Count,” without thinking, and the boy began because counting in chaos is the first helpful thing many boys learn to do, and he set a tempo that was not a march and not a surrender, one-two-three-four, five-six-seven, and he did not make the eight a place to stop because he had seen enough of the city to know that there is always a nine.

The leader of the men did the thing people do when the script falls apart; he got louder. He stepped toward the nearest woman with his mouth arranged into contempt and his breath ready to become contraband, and he raised his face and then stopped because his body had noticed something his speech had not. The hum had come into him from the floor, through the soles of his shoes, up his shins to his knees, and now his femurs were singing in a key that did not belong to him. He looked down at his legs the way a person looks at a suitcase they think might be someone else’s after all, and he lost the beat he had been using to organize himself.

The policeman, seeing an opportunity masquerading as peace, put his hand on the man’s arm with a theatrical gentleness that would look good in any camera and softly asked him to turn off the speaker, please, sir, and the man, still not fully inhabiting his body, complied. This compliance allowed order to pretend it had been responsible for the ending, and this is how endings are sold. The crowd let go of its held breath and the hum thinned into nothing and the air went back to being weather.

Morpurgo stood still long enough for the adrenaline to drain and turned her head very slowly to look at Cesar, the way you look at an animal that has elected not to bite. He met her look and nodded once and then shook his head once, two true things in a row that cancelled nothing and announced a change small enough to be underestimated by anyone who needed big stories. The radio woman, who had felt the test tone slide past her ear in a forgiving way that told her her device had done its small duty, made a note to adjust the coil of something on a table later and to call the municipal engineer whose number she had stolen from an invoice.

The Bureau wrote their press release and called the moment an inchoate demonstration of community resilience, because they had paid a consultant once for the word inchoate and wanted to use it before the invoice went cold. They did not name the men or the women or the hum or the child who had cried or the count that had saved at least one nervous system from a bad day later. They did not name Cesar because naming him complicated the arithmetic of blame, but they called him insofar as a committee can call a man and requested a meeting in a room with a long table and cookies that had been baked to taste exactly like policy.

The cookies tasted like polymer and sugar and remorse. The men at the table explained how hard it is to be in charge of a thing once you have named it and how helpful it would be if the thing could be shaped into a rule in time for the next meeting of someone with a title long enough to be a prayer. Morpurgo had agreed to attend because the world will not allow you to do your work without sometimes eating with people who make sentences bleed. She listened and observed that the room had forgotten to be a room; it had become a performance of gravity, and gravity, if you cannot see its source, begins to look like arrogance.

Cesar sat with his hands on the edge of the table, palms down, a schoolboy posture he had once learned kept him from doing things with his hands that got him scolded. He had worn a shirt with a collar because he believed in respecting rituals in rooms where people would use the wrong ones if he did not give them a better option. They asked him questions that were not questions, words assembled into nets he had no intention of walking into, and he answered the way a man answers when he has decided not to be interesting unless paid. He said he was trying. He said he had stopped and would keep stopping. He said he would not be a mascot. He said he would attend the third session. He did not say he was tired because he could not say tired without admitting the machine inside him had begun to ask for more complicated negotiations when the city sang. He did not say he was afraid of sleeping because sleep is when the laugh practices without supervision and he wakes with his mouth tasting of a sound he hates.

After, on the sidewalk, the three of them stood again the way people stand who are building something lightly and do not want to weigh it down with too much meaning too soon. “They will make their law,” said Rasha, as if she were saying the weather will decide to practice being weather later. “We do not have to let it be the only law in the room.”

“They will name the hum,” said Morpurgo, “and they will try to own it. We will have to keep it in people’s mouths and not on their letterhead.”

“They will ask me to be a good man,” said Cesar, “and I will have to decide if that requires me to give up my grief’s accent.” He flexed his hand and looked at the sky in the reliable way men look at the sky when they cannot bear to look at a woman who might know what they are about to say. “I do not know if I can.”

“Then learn another language,” said Rasha, not unkindly. “Keep your accent too. I am bored with men offering me either/or.”

He laughed in the new way because it was near and did not require permission and it hurt less than yesterday. He bought two coffees in paper cups and forgot to drink his and carried it until it felt like a duty he could not admit to hating. He walked to the edge of the water and watched a boat that said it was for tourists but was mostly for photographs, and he thought of the woman in the hospital with a pen in her hair and wondered if there had been a better ritual and whether he would have been capable of learning it even if someone had placed it in his hands like bread.

That night the city rehearsed another alarm and this time, because someone in a room with servers had read a memo written in a font that tried to be pleasant and because the radio woman had made a polite nuisance of herself at a counter where men liked to pretend edges are where power goes to die, the tone rode in on a different frequency, one that asked permission of the bodies it met. The device in his chest heard it and considered and then declined. He slept two hours without dreaming a face that was both present and missing and woke with the precise anxiety of a man who has not suffered enough to earn noon.

The third session came on a day when the dust was the color of wheat and the women did not apologize for arriving with sand at the edges of their clothes. The room had learned them and had become less defensive. There were more chairs and fewer bottles and no posters; the room had accepted its function and stopped trying to be a brochure. They did not practice for the men. They practiced for the day the men would no longer be the issue because the city would have learned to do something else unkind. They practiced for the day the hum would not be necessary and for the day after that when it might be needed again. They argued about whether to teach it to their daughters, a good argument because it contained love and an acceptance of defeat in the same proportion.

In the middle of the hour, a woman arrived late, which is to say she arrived real. She stood at the door and did not enter and then entered and stood and said, without preface, “He did it to me once in a parking lot and I didn’t tell anyone because I thought it would become a story about how I was not brave. I am not brave. I am tired. And I am here.” The room made the quiet that is required for this to land without damage, and she stepped into it as if the floor had a map printed on it that only she could read. She sat and put her bag on her lap and put both hands on it like a small animal that would not run away if she were surprised and when the hum came she did not hum and no one required her to. She stayed and left and wrote her name on a list that someone had put at the door because there is always a list and sometimes it is a way to make a body into a fact and sometimes it is a trap and you never know.

After, in the heat between buildings where the air forgets to move, Cesar put his forehead against a wall and felt it cool him as if it were one of the chalice stones they use in a rite he did not belong to. He stayed there until the heat of his head made the wall irrelevant and then took a step back and saw that he had left no mark, which both comforted and disappointed him. He turned and found Rami there because of course the boy had been there, and the boy had a question about the sound in the chamber and whether the quiet is really quiet or a kind of layered noise you have to get good at noticing, and why does the brain pretend it hates you when you make it do new work. He answered the boy in the way a smart man answers a smart child who needs to be told that adulthood is not a ladder but a scaffolding and you will climb it across and down and up and across and sometimes jump and sometimes be held by a strap you cannot see.

On the night that looked like the chapter ending because the city likes theatrics, a message arrived on a phone that belonged to a person everyone called a fixer because that’s the closest word they had for priest. The message said a man had been arrested for blowing a noise into a face and the charge was a new one and the test case had come without permission. It said the man was not Cesar and that he would be made to stand for him anyway. It said the judge liked the sound of his own gavel. It said that the woman in question had not wanted to come to court and would be required with a letter that threatened money. It said, in a quieter line, that an officer had written in his incident report that the woman had hummed and this had “aggravated” the exchange, and the word vibrated in the text like a building saw.

Morpurgo stood at the window of her office, which is to say she stood at the window of the city’s habits, and she watched the lights do their brave work and she allowed herself five minutes of being very tired in a way that was not drama but biology. She wrote, with her finger on the glass, the shapes of the plan she would throw at them in the morning, and in the condensation the letters looked like the writing of someone she could admire later. She told herself to sleep and to dream nothing and to wake with the willingness to be patient with boys and men and committees and herself. She turned off the lamp and the room did not protest. In the dark the building hummed, not the women’s hum but kin, and the hum found the small animals in her bones and told them they were not alone, which was enough for one night.By morning the city had already written its apology for whatever it was going to do. It hung under the headlines like a soft gray hem, sensible and resigned. The new charge had grown a spine overnight; it walked around in two news segments and a column by a man who adored rights more in theory than in practice and called what had happened to the woman “a misunderstanding of etiquette, escalated,” which made the word etiquette sport an injury for the rest of the day. In a courtroom that smelled like paper that had been stored where air goes to die, a judge adjusted his robe as if the garment might give him an answer. He had a face that liked rules but did not enjoy mercy unless it was tidy. The arrested man—a driver with a lanyard and a jaw that knew clenching—stood with his wrists as far apart as the cuffs allowed. The woman with the hum did not come forward. She had been called by a letter that used words like must and failing which, and she had not failed which but she had not succeeded either; she had sat on the edge of her bed and held the envelope to her chest as if it might suck the breath from her, then set the letter on the highest shelf in her kitchen, out of reach of the part of herself that liked to obey.

Morpurgo took a seat in the second row because she did not like to be seen first, and besides, there is power in the second row if you know how to sit in it. Rasha stood in the back because that is how engineers prefer their battles, with a view to the exits. The prosecutor spoke about dignity as if it were porcelain and the defendant a cat that had been allowed in the room after hours; the defense spoke about air as if it belonged to no one, which is always an argument made by the person whose body takes up more of it without paying rent. When the report came up—that the woman had hummed and this had “aggravated” the exchange—Morpurgo felt the dry polite rage that means you are about to choose the way you will be remembered in a room.

She asked to speak as an expert witness and her title was read into the microphone the way you push a chair back under the table to show you were raised correctly. She kept her voice at the level that causes people who do not care about you to lean forward in spite of themselves. She did not defend the man or the laugh or the pious right to propulsion of air; she spoke about the body’s right to instruments. She said the hum is a self-regulation, a boundary made audible, and that calling it “aggravation” was a category error with consequences. She said harm had visited the room not through volume but intention, and that the law needed to learn to hear intent without demanding bruises. She did not say that the hum was hers; she said it belonged to everyone who had ever needed a small house in their throat. The judge frowned in the way of men whose power has just been asked to become subtle. The prosecutor fumbled because her notes did not contain the sentence she needed. The defense briefly thought this woman might help him and then realized she had no interest in his client except insofar as he was the lever being applied to the wrong fulcrum.

It changed nothing and something. The judge said the words reserved and consideration and adjourned in a tone that made consideration sound like arithmetic. The man with the cuffs watched the clock as if time might be the first kind audience he had ever had. The reporters noted that an academic had complicated matters and nodded to each other like birds trading a small bright object. Outside, on the steps, the heat made the air into a syrup and poured it over their heads. The woman with the letter on her shelf stood at the bottom of the stairs and looked up at them as they came out, and when she saw the one with the glasses and the tidy jaw and the uncompromised tiredness she said, in a voice that had been put together at five in the morning when pasta refuses to boil faster, “I did not want to give them my sound.” It wasn’t a confession or a defense; it was a small map. Morpurgo nodded as if the path had been clear to her all along. It had not. It was now.

Cesar did not go to court because courthouses make his laugh wake up like a dog hearing a neighbor at the door; it’ll behave, it promises, and then it does not. He went instead to the radio woman’s shop, where the air was organized into shelves and drawers and tin boxes with labels that had grown faint with love. He set the little device she had given him on the counter with the care of a man bringing an egg he had managed not to break. She adjusted his frequency with the small incremental patience that makes wings. “They will measure your hum,” she said, not looking up, because prophecies must be delivered in a tone that suggests you are also discussing whether there’s enough sugar for tea. “They will call it provocation and then they will call it decorum. Men with filing cabinets cannot forgive a sound they cannot own.”

He asked her what he should do when the city sang without his permission and he could feel the machine in his chest request to stand and salute. She told him to consider, when the tone came, where he was and whom he was near. She told him to bend his knees slightly and imagine he was carrying a bucket of water. She told him that the body is a better resistor than any component she could solder, if only it is taught. He looked at his own knees, the least interesting part of him, and realized how rarely he had been asked to enlist them in a cause that did not involve climbing away.

The Bureau wanted a plan wrapped in ribbon and a bow. They did not mind what the plan contained, so long as it was an object that could be placed in a meeting and admired for its shape. Rasha sent them pages that looked like tables and in the cells she hid jokes that only someone with her patience would find. She recommended public training not just for women, not just for men, but for the wide category called people, a word which made the Bureau’s eyes drift because its edges are difficult to police. She proposed the city tune its alarms to consent by default and provided frequencies that had been tested against a cross-section of actual human bodies rather than the standard male, standing, calm. She insisted any ordinance make room for the sentence “no enforcement without repair,” and watched a group chat of middle managers react as though she had suggested an orgy after lunch.

At night, in the apartment where the construction site had taught her the difference between noise and sound, Morpurgo took the tie from the back of a chair, the one that reminded her to speak with care, and laid it across the table next to the badge she had kept in a drawer for ten years. She enjoyed objects more than she admitted. She liked the way they stood still while the mind did not. She thought of the place where she had earned the right to insist on being called Sergeant and the way the wind there had pushed words north toward the sea and she had learned not to shout into it. In that place she had made a decision and had carried its weight like a brick in a bag that nobody else could see. The decision had been to refuse a clean resolution in favor of a slow fix that would never make a headline. The city had forgotten her and kept her lesson. She liked that economy. She needed it now.

Rami had been to the courthouse too, against sense and for a reason that would have embarrassed him if he had been asked to say it out loud: he wanted to watch how rules are made to sit at tables. He had taken notes in a school notebook with a cartoon on the cover and had written the word aggravate and circled it until the paper wore thin. He wanted to ask the judge what noise the judge allowed in his own house, and whether the sound of his own voice had ever frightened him, and what he did then, and whether he too had said to himself I will be better and then discovered that better is a verb you do not get to conjugate once and be done. He returned home through streets that smelled of cumin and diesel and air conditioners trying to convince windows not to sweat, and on the bus he read a message on the group the women had made—he had been invited once by accident and never left and never spoke—and it was a calendar and a recipe and three gentle threats to attend an early morning experiment at the metro plaza because the men with caps had begun to meet there at dawn, believing that tired bodies are easier to scare. He considered pretending he had to be somewhere else and then decided to go to sleep in his uniform for the morning and set two alarms that would probably not work.

The dawn experiment was not noble. It was practical. Several women arrived at the plaza with coffee in cups that bragged on behalf of the beans. They wore faces that suggested they could say, with equal credibility, yes I am fine and also try that again and I will end you. They did not cluster because clusters are invitations; they dispersed like a thought you cannot quite remember when you enter a room. When the men came, hats on, signs rolled like flags that had not yet found a war, the women were already occupying the space that would have been weaponized. They did not hum. Or rather, they hummed at the level of a resting organ. They sent each other looks that were not messages but arrangements of attention. A policeman who was tired and did not want to be filmed stood with his hands where everyone could see them and did not use them. The men began because men who have promised noise to each other cannot go home without paying the bill.

The first two raspberries skittered over the concrete and died like insects in a zapper. The women did not give them anywhere to land. The third found a girl by a pillar and struck the edge of her day and she made the hum then, low, for herself, not as defense but as comfort, and the man next to her, who had not meant to be brave today, looked at her and felt the hum half in his ear and half on the skin of his forearms and he stood a little straighter. The men grew bored the way men do when their noise is not seen making a dent. They tried choreography, which failed because coordination requires consent, even among those who pretend it does not, and one of them tripped on the rolled sign and nearly fell and this created a little cascade of laughter not unlike Cesar’s but born of a different instrument: the city’s capacity to deflate. When they left, they took their speaker with them and it made the small dying-bright sound of a device losing power and the word pathetic rose in the air and then behaved itself and did not land on anyone’s face.

It was on that morning, because mornings like to layer their work, that the municipal servers implemented the new tone protocol the radio woman had argued for in a series of emails whose subject lines were dull and whose sentences were precise. The tone that came was not at human height; it slid in under the knees and lifted there, a gentle hello. Many did not notice it. Those who did felt it and thought of an old song that a city keeps for itself and plays to the pipes when they are tired. Cesar felt it and was surprised to find that the machine in his chest, which had been rehearsing rebellion, chose curiosity instead. He put his hand there and waited and the device sighed like a horse agreeing to be bridled by a rider it trusted. He found himself thinking about the way he had once, for a brief and almost-tender week, trained a bird to step onto his finger with a sunflower seed as a bribe, and the way the bird had looked at him each time as if to say do not mistake this for love. He laughed and it was new and it did not hurt, and no one heard it except a cat who preferred fish but would accept the laugh as an acceptable alternative.

The draft ordinance met the public comment the way a polite man meets a woman who recognizes him from a bar and will not let him pretend he does not remember her name. The comments were elongated sighs written in sentences. A choir director wrote that the city had no right to regulate self-song. A contractor wrote that machines talk to each other all day in pipes and wires and people deserved the same dignity. A mother of a boy who did not like loud asked whether the Bureau intended to fine the air for hurting her child when it was angry with itself. A man wrote that this was how they came for freedom, via etiquette, and he spelled etiquette with a y, which made the word look tired and sincere. The Bureau adjusted a comma and called the process responsive. A deputy sent Rasha a message with an emoji of a shrug and the word politics, and she did not reply because she preferred not to teach men her patience if she was not required by law.

Morpurgo invited the judge to the third session. He declined because judges do not attend things that might teach them to hear. He sent his clerk instead, a young person with a face that had not yet learned to disguise attention. The clerk took notes by hand and looked often at the door, as if waiting for permission to leave that would not come. During the break, in which nothing broke and people ate crackers like confession, the clerk stood near Rami and said that they had never understood sound as a form of consent before today and found that not understanding it angered them. Rami said that being angry about an idea feels better than being angry at a person and the clerk smiled and made a note: “Anger as pedagogy.” He would hear the sentence later in the judge’s courtroom when a man yelled about his rights and at least part of him would remember the room and its chairs and the hum and the way a boy had dignified a feeling that could otherwise have wrecked a day.

Cesar went, after the session, to a mosque courtyard because he liked to stand at the edges of other people’s prayers. He liked the geometry and the way the air remembered to be still for a moment and the way men who did not know how to love each other any other way stood shoulder to shoulder and allowed each other breath and error. He stood under the eaves and did not shade his eyes. He thought of the woman in the hospital and the pen in her hair and how he had wanted the world to have a ritual ready for him and how the world had shrugged and handed him a noise. He wondered if he could learn to want a ritual that did not require him to be the center of it. He tried, for two seconds, and found it difficult and therefore possible.

The loved and hated clip returned, in a new shape. It showed a bus. The angle was low, as if filmed by a child, or a camera taped to a knee. A woman stood near the driver, holding the pole with a grip that had memorized twelve storms. A man stood too close and then closer and then made the noise and then laughed and the woman did not flinch. She looked at him, directly, and opened her mouth and hummed at the pitch of the bus’s engine, and the sound was perfect, it fitted, and the driver, who had been humming under his breath all his working life to keep himself from killing the city block by block, heard the match and let his foot ease so that the acceleration came like forgiveness. The comment section for that clip was a lake where good fish swam briefly before someone dumped oil. It did not matter. The woman had recognized her instrument and the bus had done her the courtesy of being in the right key.

The arrest was converted into a fine, which is how the city performs mercy when it is tired. The man’s face appeared once and then vanished, which was, for him, both a blessing and an erasure he would cultivate into another story later, in another room, to men who would nod. The ordinance was trimmed and softened and then sent toward the vote on a day picked for its lack of drama; they called it housekeeping. In the days between, the hum moved through the city in the way of a rumor that turns out to be a skill. Girls taught it to each other with the seriousness of cards games. Aunties practiced it under their breath at the sink and did not tell their husbands what they were doing because there are intrusions the domestic cannot survive. A security guard practiced it on the empty concourse at three in the morning and it steadied his wrists when he poured tea from a plastic kettle and did not burn himself for the first time in a week. A boy with a skateboard used it by accident to keep courage in his ankles as he tried to land a trick in front of a crowd he feared would laugh, and he did not fall, and later, in a room nobody filmed, he told his friend who could not sleep that the trick was the hum, and the friend understood without a further word.

The committee asked for metrics. They wanted outcomes. They desired an index they could bring to the mayor and pin to his jacket like a flower. Morpurgo sent them stories instead and called them data sets with constraints. She argued that we measure the health of a commons not by the absence of injury but by the presence of practices. She proposed the city adopt the hum into its emergency kit, the way they had once taught citizens to bandage and to call and to get out of the way when trained people arrive. The deputy wrote back that they would pilot a “voluntary acoustic boundary” training module and that the mayor liked the name chorus more than he liked the word hum and would she kindly consider the political benefits of such a swap. She wrote no and gave six reasons, and because she was who she was and because Rasha had made sure the reasons were in a font that bored the eyes, the swap died quietly, like a bad idea finally out of air.

One evening that wanted to be the end of something but was only a shiver in the middle, the three of them found themselves again at the water. The light had decided that its job was to gild the parts of the skyline that told lies. Boats made their useful useless circles. A wedding party did a staged joy on the promenade and a child screamed for the wrong dessert. Rami showed up with a plastic bag full of oranges and handed it to Cesar without explanation and Cesar took it and knew exactly why, which is a kind of fluency a city allows you if you give it your attention without asking for romance in return. Rasha sat and unwrapped a sweet from its paper and told them that the servers had rolled back the tone once, quietly, because a neighborhood of men had complained it made their teeth ring in the night, and she had written a response that said the tone would change but also the men might wish to consider finding other parts of themselves to notice after ten p.m.

“What happens now,” Rami asked, and it was not the bored teenager’s question; it was the cartographer’s.

“Now,” said Morpurgo, “we stop pretending we can fix things without teaching the city to hear.” She pointed, without looking, at the cameras on the poles and the metal in the benches and the people with ears and without, and she said that if they were going to keep the hum in the commons, they would have to feed it, to keep it from becoming a slogan. She spoke, not at length, about the patience of deep sounds and the way laws like shallow ones because they cannot run without tripping.

Cesar held an orange and dug his thumb into the skin and stripped it clean in one pull because he had learned that trick as a child and never found a better one. He said he might leave for a while and go somewhere that does not know him and try being a man with no sound for a week. He said he might come back with a laugh that belongs to nobody and hurts no one and is more beautiful than any of this. He said he might fail and be precisely himself forever, with the machine in his chest playing cousin to the city’s experiments until he died. He said nothing that would help them plan and everything that would help them forgive themselves when he did as he would do.

They did not say goodbye because they were not sure it was time. They described to each other the small tasks of the next day: a classroom with tired chairs, a solder joint that needed attention, a mother who would not be fooled by a boy’s claim to have been at the library. They made no promises except the one that can be kept without a ceremony: that when the city sang, in any key, they would listen. They walked home in thirds that became halves that became alone, and the wind tried on a new temperature for an hour just to see whether anyone would notice. In the dark, in rooms where radios and refrigerators and stray souls made their patient domestic hum, the city dreamt of being an instrument and woke to the knowledge that it already was, and that no ordinance would ever be able to keep it from tuning itself to the bodies who lived inside it, one small, stubborn frequency at a time.The week lurched forward with the steadiness of a car whose alignment was slightly off, always pulling them back to the same question no matter how they arranged their hands on the wheel. The ordinance moved in corridors where carpet flattened as men paced and the words were arranged until they no longer resembled the days that had made them necessary. Outside those rooms the city convened its own committees in kitchens and stairwells and on buses where women talked to each other in sentences with gaps that kindness bridged. The hum had learned to walk without calling attention to itself. It showed up in the pharmacy line when the man two back started practising his courage and the pharmacist’s assistant looked up with a face that said not here, not while I count these pills; it showed up in the corner of a classroom when a girl decided to take up air with her body and her teacher kept speaking and somehow made space for both the lesson and the song. Rasha began to keep a map that was not a map, a list of places where the hum had announced itself in the world, not as an event but as a habit, and she wrote beside each one the time of day because she believed patterns are temporal before they are spatial. Morpurgo printed the list and folded it into the notebook where she kept the words the committee liked to see and took it out sometimes in meetings and laid it next to the agenda like a talisman nobody else knew how to use.

On a morning as bleached as a sheet in a hospital laundry, a woman came to the campus with a yellow folder pressed flat under her arm and a careful way of moving that suggested she was accustomed to rooms getting in the way. She wore no badge and offered no apology for this. The receptionist called up without explaining why she was calling, and the name she said had a weight that made Sergeant Morpurgo stand before she picked up the phone. The woman’s name belonged to another city and another version of this one, to a place where Morpurgo had worn the other title like a shield and had been asked to choose which parts of herself could enter a room at once. When they met, in the corridor with the art that pretended that certain shapes are universally calming, the woman lifted the folder without preamble and said she had been the nurse with the pen in her hair, and the pen had been blue, and his laugh had made the pen feel like a weapon she couldn’t put down. She said she had not come to accuse anyone of anything that could be written in a ledger. She had come to ask whether it would help to tell the story that did not make the clip, the part where she had stepped away from the door after and had leaned against a wall and had remembered forgetting to buy a lemon and had hated herself for it and then had loved herself again because life demands so many small betrayals and you are permitted to survive them.

They went to a room with a window that looked like a postcard of a city the city wanted to be, and they sat with their knees not quite touching because neither of them liked to be mistaken for a pair. The nurse told her the chronology, which was a kindness even when it was unnecessary, because the mind likes to hang emotions on pegs shaped like time. She said there had been a week without sleep and then a boy who did not smile and then a woman who did not wake and then a corridor in which every sound lived as long as it wanted to. She said the man’s noise had not hurt but it had declared ownership in a way that made the walls tilt. She said she had wanted to throw her chart at him and then had not, because nurses use their hands to save people for a living and the habit is difficult to break for revenge. She said that when she had gone home that night she had washed her hands twice and then had held them under the tap until the heat almost made them clean, and then she had hummed without meaning to and her own hum had been so honest she had had to sit down. Morpurgo listened with the posture she reserved for stories that would become teeth in the gears of whatever machine came next. She took no notes because there are things you do not put in a file if you want them to keep their shape. The nurse put the folder on the table and said it contained nothing of use, just schedules and a drawing a child had made in a waiting room of a machine with a smile, and then she said she had come partly to say that the hum made sense to a body that knows more than it tells a person about how to be one, and partly to be seen by someone who had seen him and who might remind her that she had not imagined being made small by a stranger with a noise.

The morning she left, the university’s custodians wheeled their carts past the room and their buckets made that honest slosh that is the sound of work not pretending to be anything else. Rasha intercepted the woman at the door and thanked her for the folder as if it were the sort of gift you know where to put, and when the elevator doors closed the two of them stood in the hallway and did not touch and did not need to. Later, when Sergeant Morpurgo wrote her report for the Bureau in phrases the men could reproduce without choking, she slid one sentence from that conversation into the middle of a paragraph about regulation: Bodies already know how to make a boundary audible; our work is not to distribute permission but to remove the obstacles to practice. She kept the period where it would annoy a lawyer and a soldier both.

The city, never content to be merely itself, summoned another problem that looked like the first in a way that would tempt a committee to write the same solution twice. A startup sent a deck to the Bureau with a font that tried to convince everyone it was not afraid of being young. It proposed “Civic Resonance Management” and promised a network of small devices, discreet as pins, that could detect the frequency of “malevolent expulsive sounds” and emit a counter-tone calibrated to “neutralize antagonistic respiratory events.” The deck had diagrams of happy people in a pastel square with their mouths closed and a small star above each device to indicate a protective field. The deck had numbers that gave the illusion of solidity. The deck had an order form at the back with a bulk discount that made Rasha write in the margin in a hand that nobody in Procurement could read, Absolutely not, and then underline it twice with a line that did not shake. A meeting was called in a room with glass walls because men like to be seen deciding, and the representatives explained in the practiced way of people who present to money that their devices would free women from the labor of protecting themselves by obliging the air to take their side. Sergeant Morpurgo sat without a tie and with the uncompromised tiredness the nurse had recognized and watched the men talk as if the problem were the lack of machinery. When it was their turn to ask questions, she spoke first and asked what would happen when two rooms met with devices set to different intentions, and when the representative said we envision a unified platform she asked what happens when a child’s cochlea meets a machine that thinks it is a parent. The representative said our lab trials suggest negligible impact and Rasha said your lab trials do not include my aunt and the man looked for the joke and did not find it. They killed the deck without fanfare, which is the way a city is saved sometimes, in rooms where people who like tools remember that tools can lie with a straight face.

Rami learned the cost of curiosity on a Monday printed with the bland optimism of administrators, chiding and cheerful. A counselor called him into a room and asked if he had been present at a disturbance described as “a public safety consultation that became unproductive,” and when he said yes, he had listened, the counselor arranged her mouth into a smile that had learned to be gentle and handed him a letter that said he would write a reflection on the importance of neutrality in civic spaces. He took the letter and thought very quickly about whether he would write the reflection he was being asked to write or the one that would be honest, and he sat for a long time with both possibilities in front of him without committing, which made him feel sophisticated for a second and then foolish. At dinner his mother asked him how his day had been and he said fine, and then he did not sleep until he had written two pages in a notebook that did not belong to school about the hum and about the way his own breath feels like a trespass in rooms where men say words like respectful and forget to respect. In the morning he wrote the reflection the counselor wanted, which trained an old muscle to do a trick, but when he handed it over he let his fingers brush the paper a second longer than necessary and his eyes met hers and a rumor of a grin crossed his face and she understood that his obedience contained within it a refusal that he would deploy later when he had more leverage.

Cesar, who had promised several different versions of himself to several different people and had not yet decided which one he would deliver, took a bus to a neighborhood where the buildings were older and the sky more generous because it had fewer glass planes to bounce off. He went to the hospital courtyard without going inside and stood near the fountain because if he stood near the fountain he could lie to himself that he had come to admire the engineering. The fountain’s pump made a tiny complaint as it labored against the grit. A woman emerged carrying a bag with a logo that had tried to make health into a brand, and in her hair was a pen the color of ocean, and he felt the strange click when his story and hers decide to be in a paragraph again. He did not approach her immediately because he had learned that the way you arrive is the way the conversation will go. He waited until she had shaken her head the way a nurse shakes her head after a shift, not to dislodge anything but to redistribute the day. When he spoke he said, in a voice that had been tuned in the anechoic chamber to be less a declaration than a question, that he had been in a corridor where she had been and that he had noticed the pen because grief teaches you to fix on the smallest color in the room until the rest of the room stops trying to drown you. She looked at him the way a person looks at a wave arriving at an angle they do not prefer and decided not to step away. She said she had given the pen to a girl who drew cities on paper and would be told one day that drawing cities was not a job, and she had bought another, and he nodded because he knew about replacing instruments with exact replicas as if that could stabilize the story. He said he had made a noise that had made the walls tilt and that he had understood only later that the noise had not been as innocent as he had wanted it to be, and she said he was late to that understanding and that lateness had a cost, and he said yes, and then she surprised herself by telling him about the hum and he surprised himself by not pretending that he had invented it.

The men in caps, denied their preferred theatre and bored by a city that had decided not to react in the predictable way, found a new toy in a corner of the internet that specializes in toys and suggested to them a tone generator on a phone that could produce sounds too high for certain ears. It was sold as a prank and a messenger deterrent and a way to keep old people from enjoying coffee, and the reviews were written in the language of boys who have learned that cruelty is a style. They downloaded the app with the glee of children smuggling fireworks and took it to a square where pigeons with the city’s math in their heads might have once been. They pressed the button and laughed when the teenagers flinched and the women looked around for the source of the itch and the toddlers put their hands over their ears and learned a new word for the world. The first morning it happened, the hum did not know what to do with it because its instinct is to comfort not repel, and it threw its arms around bodies that had been accosted and made them inside their bones a little less alone, and the men yelled that the women were chanting and tried to inflate themselves into an emergency. Rasha stood beside a lamppost with her phone open to the app and made a note of the frequencies not with numbers but with faces—the face a woman makes when she cannot find the source of the harm, the face a boy makes when he realizes his youth has made him into prey for a laugh, the face a man in uniform makes when he realizes that his training contains no section on invisible knives. That afternoon she sat with the radio woman in a shop that smelled of warmed tin and the two of them built, with the lack of fuss of people who prefer function to drama, a test tone that folded the men’s frequencies down into something like a dull throb and rewrote the shape of the sound so that the body could understand it as information rather than attack. They could not break the app. They could teach bodies not to panic when it came.

The vote on the ordinance, when it finally arrived, had been scheduled for a late hour so that it would not meet the eyes of too many people. Night votes are the city’s way of tucking difficult decisions under the pillow and hoping the tooth fairy will take them away while everyone is sleeping. The chamber had lights that flatter paper and punish skin. The councillors cleared their throats and spoke into microphones that made their words sound like policy before they were. The phrase Directed Airborne Harassment had grown heavy enough to sit without wobbling. It had acquired a section on devices and a section on intent and a section on exemptions for performances sanctioned by the Department of Culture which made at least three women in the gallery grip the underside of their chairs. Sergeant Morpurgo had given the speech she was permitted to give before the item, which was not the speech she would have given if she had allowed herself to be only a person and not also a professional. She spoke about practices as public goods. She insisted the ordinance not prohibit the hum by accident or by the laziness that often hides inside attempts at neutrality. She argued for a clause that recognized restorative measures as satisfying the first obligation of the city before fines were collected, and the clerk, who had attended the second session and written anger as pedagogy, inserted the clause in language that would irritate a future prosecutor in exactly the right way.

When it passed, it passed with three dissenting votes that had nothing to do with justice and everything to do with enemies and alliances that had been forged at dinners none of them would have been invited to. The men in caps claimed victory because a thing had been named and they had been there when it was named and they did not hear the word restraint because restraint whispers. The Bureau announced guidance and produced a poster with a cartoon mouth and a red circle and a slash that would be placed at the entrances to public buildings, which meant the laugh would encounter its own negation on the way to buy bread and nobody knew yet what that would do to it. Rasha went home and ate an egg with salt and looked at the ceiling and laughed into her own hair, and the laughter sounded like a small drum stepped on by a friend to check it was real. Morpurgo walked the long way to her apartment because she needed the city’s night to convince her that the day had been lived for a reason other than deliverables. She stopped on a bridge and watched a boat with blue lights perform a version of itself for a phone and thought about the boy with the skateboard counting and about the nurse with the pen and about the sentence she had written in the report that she would have to spend a year defending and about how beautiful that year might be if she could keep the room right.

On a Tuesday that remembered rain without providing any, an elderwoman’s choir borrowed a library auditorium and sang songs that had accompanied women’s hands for years across continents, and before they began the conductor, who had been a nurse once and a soldier’s sister and a teacher of proverbs you cannot find written down anywhere, told the room they would also sing the hum. She called it by its name and not by the city’s; she said it belonged to them and that no ordinance could take it, and the librarian, whose job required her to pretend she was neutral, clapped first because librarians are custodians of words and they know that names are how you keep a thing from being stolen. The choir’s hum was like a field where wind refuses to be tamed by fences. It held the audience in a small mercy and taught three girls in the back row that the thing their mothers were doing under their breath on buses had a stage and a glow and could be beautiful without asking permission.

Cesar tried leaving, because the city had taught him that leaving is a skill you develop with practice and not a single dramatic gesture you accomplish once. He bought a ticket to a place whose photographs misrepresent its air and he got as far as standing in line at a gate where announcements in three languages paste a layer of bureaucracy over the chance of flight. He watched a child fall asleep on a stranger’s shoulder and be moved so gently that he had to look away, and when he looked back a woman was watching him with a face that had known him without ever having seen him, and he realized he could not yet decide not to be witnessed by this particular city. He returned the ticket in a transaction so polite it felt like a conversation between two people who did not want to admit they were breaking up. He walked the concourse until he found the corner where the hum lived, next to a vending machine that ate coins, and he sat with it until the night cleaning staff began their dance, working in pairs, companionable, invisible. When he went home the machine in his chest did not complain at the change of plan. It had adjusted to the new tone the servers now used and had come to trust the hand that taught it to wait.

He saw Rami the next afternoon in the market near the tangerines and lifted his chin in the way men do when they recognize themselves in a boy and do not want to frighten him with the full smile. Rami had his schoolbag and his uniform and a face trying to decide whether to show the man he was becoming or to keep being a child a little longer in defiance of the calendar. They walked to the edge of the stall where the cats preferred the shade and stood without deciding who would speak first. Rami told him that the reflection assignment had been both easy and wrong and that he had written it twice in his head before choosing the one that would not require a parent’s signature. Cesar told him that he had tried to leave and had failed and that he did not know whether failure felt like relief or like defeat, and that he suspected relief and defeat might be siblings rather than enemies. They did not discuss mentorship because mentorship is a word that belongs in other rooms. They discussed oranges and breath and the use of counting in rooms where the floor does not move to help you find your step, and when they parted Rami felt lighter in a place he had not been aware of carrying weight and Cesar felt no lighter at all and accepted that as his day’s honesty.

By the time the city settled into the experiment of living with a law that tried to discipline the air, the hum had passed the border from innovation into tradition, which is when things become dangerous and durable at once. Men began to teach it to each other, which surprised no one who has ever watched a man try on a dress in the mirror of his wife’s closet while she is out and not tell anyone he looked good. A bus driver taught it to the drivers who took the night shift and they turned down the radio and tried it in the depot, and the depot liked it, because buildings have preferences that they do not know how to litigate. A group of domestic workers taught it in a park on their day off and hummed for each other with a precision born of homesickness and rivers and the discipline required to love people from a distance without breaking. The workplace of men with shirts discovered the hum by accident when two women in accounting, faced with an audit that had arrived as both threat and instrument, sat at adjacent desks and made the note quietly for themselves and discovered it made men ask them fewer questions for an hour, which is how timelines are saved.

The newspaper ran a story about it that did not use the word empowerment because the editor had learned to distrust words that are asked to do too much of other people’s work. It used the word practice and the word kindness and the word repetition and someone wrote in the letters that hummable should be a category of public policy, and someone else wrote, less kindly, that it was a fad, and someone else wrote, more tired than angry, that the city should fix the roads. The city, being what it is, did all of these things poorly and some of them beautifully, and nobody got all of what they wanted, and the world went on, and the hum, like all good instruments, became something you do while you wait for the bus and also the thing that keeps you from becoming the worst version of yourself when a stranger decides to hand you their loneliness shaped like a weapon.

Late, without style, on a night when the sea sounded like an appliance that will not be fixed until payday, the three of them found themselves not entirely by accident in a cafe that had decided to remain old-fashioned simply by failing to get rich. The owner had stopped pretending to recognize everyone by a name nobody else used, but he still wiped the counter as if the day could be made better by a cloth. The television in the corner was playing a song from a country that has learned handclaps as survival and the sound bled into their table and gave them permission to drum their fingers without calling it strategy. They spoke about the coming trainings, a pilot that would take the hum into places where bodies are already required to obey, and how to write consent in a way that would satisfy the committees without selling the women out. They spoke about a rumor that a corporation wanted to underwrite the chorus and call it theirs, and how Swiftly No would be the correct register for that conversation. They spoke about the boy’s school letter and the judge’s clerk and the nurse’s pen and the men with caps who had begun to get bored. They did not speak about the long end of this, the part where the city will move on to hurting in a new shape and they will have to learn another instrument. They let the night carry that part for them.

When they left, their shadows overlapped briefly on the pavement and made a darkness that was more interesting than any of them alone. Above them, a camera blinked because that is what it knows how to do. In a server room somewhere a device listened to its own breath and tried to decide whether to sing. The air was not neutral. It belonged to no one and to everyone and to the rituals they were teaching each other in rooms with bad lighting and good acoustics and on sidewalks where the city approves of nothing except persistence. The city tuned itself a hair to the left and noticed that it liked the note better and kept it, and somewhere in a pocket, a coil sighed like a creature going to sleep in a house that, finally, had learned the pitch of its walls.
