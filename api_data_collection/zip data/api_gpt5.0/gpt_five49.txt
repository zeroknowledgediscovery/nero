No one in Irving sleeps when the cicadas find their rhythm. They chew up the evening with electric teeth, gnawing song from the pecans and cottonwoods that sag along the alleys, and it climbs the stucco walls of our group home like a neon sign saying live, live, live. I lay there, in a bunk by the window, sweating and not sleeping, and pretend the sound is rain in some other month. But you can’t pretend through a Texas August forever. There’s always another wing, another click of a shell.

If I dream, I dream the cheap carpet of a motel on 183, the pattern like rusty hexagons. I’m lying with my cheek in it. Shadows on the wall that could be ceiling fans or a man leaning, a woman lighting a cigarette, or something else that hums. A weight against my ear—the whispering scrape of a hard leg—and I shove and I can’t shove. My mother’s voice across the room, what little I can remember of her, and then the brown shape lifts and runs for the dark, and I swear the carpet itself runs, too.

“Up, Eli,” Vic says, and the bunk creaks in real time. “Kitchen’s not your mother.”

He means there’s no one to make pancakes. He means wear a shirt. He means don’t be late. He clangs the spoon against the doorframe like a bell. The sound enters my skull and tings around inside it twice.

I sit up. There’s a moth smoothed flat against the glass like a thumbprint. For a moment it seems to move without moving, the way wings can trick you. I look away just in case. I’ve learned that’s a kind of bravery too—knowing which parts you can’t stare at to go on breathing.

By the door, the house dog, Baxter, breathes a saw-toothed snore. He’s black and white and too friendly, to the point of injury. He once crashed into a coffee table trying to greet a caterer and spent three days with a cone, howling like a future ghost. I scratch his head and he blinks like I woke up from a good story and he didn’t. We’ve negotiated an agreement: I will love him, and he will not find every beetle on the patio and bring it back to show me.

The kitchen’s got the orange tile that’s supposed to feel warm, as if color is a heater. Vic cooks like he counts: two eggs each, one piece of toast, a vast vat of coffee that looks like motor oil and tastes like an apology. Vic’s beard is always five o’clock. He’s the kind of guy who should be in charge of dog rescues and disaster shelters, and somehow got stuck with boys.

“Morning,” he says. This is how you say love when breakfast is a production line.

There are seven of us at Leland House this season. Two of the little ones whisper about a YouTube video. Dre sits sideways at the table so he can drop a napkin over my shoulder later and make me jump. I try to pretend I don’t know he’s got a hobby. Maribel, who works nights, is still awake, stirring oatmeal like it’s a spell. My shirt has a stain on one sleeve, something I can’t place. This happens a lot. You live like a traveling circus and your clothing learns to travel too.

“You didn’t sleep,” Maribel says. She can see it in the pale places.

“Cicadas,” I say. I avoid the word gross. I avoid the word pest. You don’t want to taunt the world with your personal kryptonite.

“Those things are a Texas lullaby,” Dre says. “You need to man up and hum along.”

“Those things live underground for like fifteen years,” I tell him, because facts are small shields sometimes. “You want me to hum with a forest of teenage boys too scared to come out?”

Dre laughs so loud he startles himself. “Eli got jokes. Eli got himself a brain bug.”

Vic flicks his wrist in a no more. He’s kind when he can be, and apparently Wednesday morning is not that hour. “Leave him,” he says.

“Yeah, leave me,” I echo, chewing toast that tastes like nothing. “I’ve already got sleep trying to leave me. I don’t need you to join the parade.”

Irving High is twelve stops with the footpath and two with the bus and one with a sprint because the crosswalk by the Whataburger is never not a can-you-make-it. The day is bright like someone left the light on over the whole city. A billboard on 183 shows a lawyer in a dark suit with teeth so white they could reflect airplanes. The air has the kind of heat that pats you down to see what you’re hiding.

At the bus stop, a little boy in a Batman shirt is kneeling with his finger in an anthill. I detour into the street and then remember to detour back, because the last time somebody walked into the actual road by Loop 12 they had to scoop him up like soup. The boy’s mother has her phone out and glances up long enough to say, “Adam, don’t. The ants,” and Adam says, “I’m their king.”

I want to tell him, kid, the ants don’t have kings. I want to tell him, kid, the ants only have thousands of faces that look like the same face when they touch you with what they have instead of hands, and I wish I didn’t know that. But the bus pulls up and the door breathes and we all tilt up into it like a flock of upright birds. I sit in the very front so I don’t have to watch the floor for movement.

On school mornings we all pretend not to see each other. I’m good at this. Imagine you’re under a clear sheet of ice: everything above you looks like sky but feels heavy. That’s the hallway, the cafeteria, the gym. There’s a relief to the routinely difficult. This class, then that one, then a bell and you locate your body again, carry it to the next place like luggage.

Coach Ramirez is the one adult in the building who knows how not to laugh. He says my name like a question that can wait. “Eli,” he says when I walk past, and points at the scuffed basketball in his palm like it’s a world he’s asking if I’d like to hold. I tell him maybe later. I always forget that “later” has a cost when you put it down somewhere and someone else picks up.

First period English we sit under a poster that says Write What You Know and watch the class clown write “pasta” over and over on his journal page. Mrs. Dannel does not notice the way my pencils all look chewed because they are chewed. She assigns us an essay about origins. Where do you come from, she writes on the board. I write Irving. I write the canal in Las Colinas where the mustangs run forever, bronze mouths open, not eating any water. I start to write my mother and stop. I write my best friend, Cal, like that settles something inside me. It doesn’t.

At lunch, Dre and two of his satellites, both named Jay or maybe I’m just lazy, trap me by the vending machines with a story about a cockroach. It’s a big story and a bigger roach, in their hands. The vending machines hum so hard the sugar inside must be vibrating. Dre’s eyes glitter like he’s won something.

“Bro,” he says, a word he uses for everyone and nobody. “I got something special.”

“Please don’t,” I say. If you say please enough times it’s supposed to make people remember they were babies once, instead of knives.

He opens his fist. He’s not holding anything. He makes a clucking sound with his tongue, the way grownups do to horses, and I decide to hate the fact that even pretend makes my throat close up. The Jays snort. One of them says, “He’s gonna faint.”

“I’m not,” I say. I’m not. The chest is a room and someone has put too many tables in it and the chairs are tipped wrong, but it’s still a room you can walk through. “I’m not.”

“Gonna faint,” Dre sings, and then he does the thing I knew he was going to do. He reaches for my shoulder, probably with a stupid paperclip he’s shaped like a bug, and I jerk away so hard my lunch falls. The tray is a little yellow pond on the floor.

A pair of hands appears in the edge of my vision, hands that look like rock-climber hands, callused, trustworthy. The hands pick up my milk, my fork, my dignity. “C’mon,” Cal says. His voice is a place I know how to sit down. “Let’s go outside.”

“I’m fine,” I say out of habit. This is our script. I say I’m fine. He says, No you’re not. I say it again with more letters. He says nothing. He simply is there, and sometimes I forget that being there is the holy work.

“Outside,” he says again, and he doesn’t touch me, which is important, but he walks like an invitation. We sit by the gum-chiseled stairs, where you can see the parking lot waving heat like a flag. He has a scar on one knuckle that looks like a slash of chalk. When we were twelve he cut it on a chain-link fence trying to scale his way out of someone else’s yard. “You okay?” he says, when enough air has put itself back inside me.

“Define,” I say. “Okay as in functional, or okay as in not a walking bug siren.”

“Functional,” he says. “We’re not philosophers. We’re kids who eat lunch in Texas.”

“Sometimes I think I’m see-through,” I tell him. “Like everybody’s got a light and I’m the thing that fails to block it.”

“Sometimes I think you’re a ghost,” he answers. “But like, the kind that sits with you and helps you do your math.”

“What if I can’t go into the lab today?” I ask. “They’ve got that tarantula.”

“You can go in,” he says. “You can go in because you don’t have to look. Nobody ever said you have to look.”

“They did, though,” I say. “That’s the whole point of school. Look.”

He leans his head against the wall like he’s in a music video and you can hear the guitar through the bricks. He squints up at the slice of sky that exists between two slabs of concrete. He says, eventually, “You know I got you, right?”

“You and the you,” I say.

“Me and me,” he says, grinning. I don’t know why that makes my throat warm. Maybe because it makes me think of twins, the kind of safety that comes from knowing there’s another copy of your face somewhere to take over when you get tired. Cal is taller than me. His hair never behaves. He’s better at making a joke land than I am.

If you monitor small changes like a biologist who loves details, you will notice the way people look at me is in groups. The group that thinks they can get me to scream. The group that thinks they can get me to stop. The group that thinks my fear is a religion and they should proselytize. Very few people say nothing from a place of actual quiet. Coach, Maribel, sometimes the night manager at the library who peels stickers from returned books with monastic focus.

“Hey,” I say, because another thing I can give the world is my name, scraped off the inside of my mouth and handed over. “Thanks.”

“Don’t start,” Cal says, and we both smile.

Afternoons I mop the hallway at the home after school because Vic believes in labor as a form of clean. Each tile is its own square of ocean and the mop is a boat you drag over and over until it forgets what foot tracked what. Baxter follows me like a guard with poor training. When I reach the end of the hall and look back, the wet parts shine and I can see my reflection broken in twenty pieces. For a second the pieces seem to move without me.

“Mopping looks good, Eli,” Vic calls. “Some people never learn how to care. You might learn it too well.”

“That a thing?” I ask. “Too much care? Is that possible?”

He shrugs. “Ask your ants.”

“Don’t,” I say, too fast, and he holds up his hands like he forgot he was holding a weapon.

Dre leaves a shoe in the middle of the kitchen for me to trip over. Someone has tagged the back fence with a crown and the letter M. At seven, a car with subwoofers parks outside like thunder you can rent. At eight, the little kids watch a cartoon so bright it could bleach bones. At nine, I go upstairs and sit in the dark and wait for the cicadas to light the night up again with their bodies. If I hold completely still, I can almost pretend I’m not twitching.

What I don’t tell people is that the fear is not simply a jump; it’s a door and a door and a door that keeps opening, and behind each one is another small thing you forgot about. Not just roaches, though they’re the worst of it, roaches that are shiny like nightmares that got buffed. Also worms on a sidewalk after rain, secret and surprised. Also the sudden whip of a dragonfly in a culvert like a jeweled helicopter. The surprise is its own species. The movement is a new language no one asked you to learn.

You find ways around it if you want to keep living. You shake out shoes. You clap two plates together before you put them in the cabinet because that’s where something might love the dark. You avoid the baseball field because grasshoppers patrol like soldiers and leap like they’ve sworn a private oath to get in your peripheral. You can avoid a lot if you design your days like mazes.

But you cannot avoid science class.

I knew it before I walked in. The air had a smell to it, something like damp towels and formaldehyde and chalk. If you think you can smell a spider, that’s your brain lying to you with the exuberance of a child. Maybe it was the crickets in the terrarium. Maybe it was the memory of smell itself. Ms. Lowry stood by the sink with a pair of tongs and an expression like she was going to be gentle for my own good.

“Don’t,” I said before she spoke. It startled her in a way that made me feel immediately sorry.

“Eli,” she said, “you’re in this lab too. I’m not going to let you fail because of a myth.”

“What’s the myth?” I asked. I held my pencil like a knife I’d never use. Cal had third period lunch and didn’t cross this corridor. I wished for him in my pocket like a talisman.

“The myth,” she said, “is that the things you hate have more power than the things you want.”

I didn’t say, the things I want are quiet and don’t wave. She lifted the lid on the terrarium and a cricket hopped against the glass, which made a sound like a small bell. The tarantula was in the corner of the other cage, black and rust like a piece of abandoned machinery. I knew the facts. It was gentle. It was shy. It would rather run than bite. It would rather bite than do anything else. Nature is full of contradictory kindness.

“We’re only looking,” she said. “We’re looking and labeling. You can do the looking part without the naming.”

I did not remember putting my hands under my desk but they were there, white and tense. Someone behind me laughed. Not Ms. Lowry. Laughter is its own organism. It yawned and stretched and said, what’s the punchline, and I wanted to leave here and go to the canal and watch the mustangs run where they never had to stop. I wanted a city with no corners.

I do not know what my face did. I know that I got up, and that I backed into a lab stool and almost fell, and that Ms. Lowry said my name like she had responsibility sewn to the inside of it, like a label that says who to call if lost. I know that the tarantula didn’t move. I know the cricket did, and it was enough. I know that the floor is a good place to understand gravity.

I sat out in the hallway afterward with a paper cone of water that evaporated as I watched. The brick wall across from me had names etched into it: Anna 2017, D.S. was here. It’s good to be reminded you are not the first. Cal found me there without anybody telling him. This is one of his tricks. He has a nose for where I go when I break.

“You look like you got left in the sun,” he said.

“I keep thinking I can do it if I decide to,” I told him. “Like if I will it enough. That’s what they all think, right? Fear is a thing you talk to. You shake its hand. You negotiate a treaty. Instead it’s a thing that buys your house at auction while you’re sleeping and puts up new curtains.”

“New curtains?” he said. “What color are the curtains?”

“Brown,” I whispered, and he got it, and his face did a little twist and then un-twisted.

“Okay,” he said. “We can do something else. We can try another door.”

“What door,” I said to my knees.

“Maybe the library,” he said. “Maybe we go hunting online. I saw a thing the other night—a thread. Not like random advice. A guide. Like steps with words you can pronounce.”

“Like experts?” My voice hated itself for hoping.

“Like people with the same problem who figured something out,” he said. “No promises. None of that. Just experiments. We’re good at experiments.”

“We?” I asked, and he bumped his shoulder into the air just next to mine and said, “Me,” like a correction of a typo no one else can see.

It is hard to explain what it is to have a friend when you grew without one. The first time Cal sat next to me on the curb outside a laundromat on Britain after my last foster family rotated me out, I thought he was going to ask for quarters. Instead he took one from his pocket and rolled it over his fingers like a magician with tiny talent and said, “You watch the machines spin and it gets hypnotizing,” and I said, “I don’t get hypnotized,” and he said, “You do now.” He laughs at the wrong time and the right time. He walks like trouble with a different career. He always ties his shoes too tightly and then complains of blood loss. I collected these things like pennies. I’m trying to pay for something with them, I think.

We go to the library off Rochelle because the air there is always the exact temperature water would prefer. The ceiling makes a soft grid over our heads, and the kids’ section has a crash mat where toddlers launch themselves like gymnasts of an alternate planet. The librarian, Ray, is the kind of person who moves like a whisper. He lifts a finger at us without looking up, a quiet “hello,” and returns to stamping something that looks like a passport but is only a return slip.

In the corner with the public computers, people from separate continents share the same screen saver. A man watches soccer highlights with the reverence of a real believer. A woman in a pink hoodie types with two fingers like she is dialing a safe. Cal logs us in and I hover. If I touch the keyboard, my hands will sweat too much and the letters will turn to little rafts. Cal has better fingers for this.

He searches like a person looking for his own name in a crowd. Most of what he finds looks like noise. Ten tips to overcome. The word cope appears like a brand. One site has a cartoon roach waving a broom and we both flinch. Another is a forum so old the avatars are the size of thumbnails. The scroll could go forever. It is an ocean with no buoys.

“Wait,” he says, and taps something that makes the room tilt. It’s a thread on a site I’ve never seen, with a pale gray background and a header that looks like it was designed by someone who still believes in HTML as an art. The username of the person who wrote it is odd, like an acronym or an inside joke (AFK_Cicada). The post is a long, patient exhale. Steps, but not the kind that assume you’ve got stairs.

The first step says: Name the smallest version of your fear. Don’t romanticize. Don’t make a speech. What can you stand for one second and not die? That’s where you begin. Write that down somewhere you can read it when your heart’s a blender.

“We can do that,” Cal says, too fast. “You can do that. You name a thing.”

“A picture,” I say. “On a page. Not moving.”

“Maybe it moves a little,” he says. It sounds like a joke. He means well. He is not a joke.

The second says: What you feed grows. What you starve grows too, in shadows. You are building a ladder with rungs spaced the distance of your breath. Collect a week of safe pictures. Do not jump ahead. Do not insult yourself calling this easy. Brains like rightsizing. You’ll get bored. That’s the point.

“I’m good at being bored,” I say. “It’s my best player.”

The third says: You’re allowed to be angry at people who laugh. You’re allowed to be angry at yourself for building this wall. But anger is fuel you can burn or fuel that burns you. Choose how you cook.

Cal scrolls and scrolls. There are people replying beneath with usernames that look like weather. Someone has written: I did step one and my hands stopped screaming on day nine. Another: day three gave me a migraine but then I slept for twelve hours and I dreamt a moth that looked like a ship and I did not run. On page seven, someone has pasted a photo of a beetle the size of a thumbnail and the entire thread goes quiet for a breath. You can feel it, even across time.

“This,” he says, turning the screen towards me as if he could turn the whole room, “this might be something.”

“Maybe,” I say, like a superstition, like I don’t want to jinx it. We copy the steps into a notebook that has somebody else’s name scratched out on the cover so many times you can’t tell what it used to be. Cal writes in block letters that look like the letters have been lifting weights.

On the bus back, I see a spider on the ceiling of the bus that is probably not a spider. It’s a swirl of dirt, a concentrate of nothing. My skin says, just in case. I practice thinking about the picture of a beetle the size of a thumbnail for exactly one breath and then I look away, like the directions say.

We stop at the canal because the light there at five is a soft thing. It folds itself over the bronze horses, and the water says something about time that is not cruel. Cal leans over the railing and spits to see the ripples. “Tell me how it’s going to be,” he says, like we’re writing a radio show in our heads. “Episode one: the boy who believed the world had too many legs.”

“Episode two,” I say, “how he decided he’d adopt a planet and teach it how to move. Episode three: the boy and his brave best friend.”

“Episodes five through seventeen: everyone gets bored and thinks it’s not working,” he says, making a face. “But we keep going anyway.”

“Eighteen: he goes into the lab without running. Not all the way, just to the door, and then further, and then further still.”

“Nineteen: nobody laughs at him because we sell tickets instead,” he says, and we both laugh too loudly, the kind of laugh that says we need it more than oxygen.

We go home. The cicadas rehearse. Baxter finds a lost fry under the couch and eats it with the satisfaction of a king. Vic says we’re out of milk because somebody drank straight from the carton, and I suspect Dre by the slant of his grin. I go upstairs and write the smallest version of my fear in the notebook, on a page that already smells like pencil and sweat and something else I can’t name. I write: a photograph of a fly in a book. Then I cross out the fly and write: a drawing of a fly.

Some people have parents that tell them how to hold a knife and some people have the internet. We have both if you count Ms. Lowry and Coach and Maribel as the kind of parents who come in shifts. Cal texts me three photos that are, in order, a cartoon ladybug, a cartoon bee with sunglasses, a cartoon roach from a nineteenth-century biology text that looks like a science-y stamp. I breathe very carefully at the last one. My heart tries to take its light and go to another room. I look for one second. I look for two. I send back a thumbs up emoji because modern courage can look like anything.

Around ten, the kids downstairs scream because someone has produced a YouTube video with a jump scare. Vic confiscates the iPad and announces a curfew. Dre calls me bug boy under his breath. I tell the wall I am building a ladder. The wall does not answer. It never does.

I fall asleep hard enough to fool myself. In the dream, all the doors open, and behind each one is not a thing on legs but a boy with my mouth, laughing like he’s not scared at all. He hands me a script. He says, Try again. He says, You can write this different. He says, Remember those horses. The bronze at the canal isn’t moving, no, but who said motion was required for flight.

Morning breaks and the world smells like someone burned toast on a national level. It’s a kinder smell than the formaldehyde that waits in the lab. I take the notebook with me like a small riot in my backpack. I tell myself I have armor. Paper. Ink. Names.

On the way, a truck goes by with a pest control logo: a cartoon roach with a red circle and slash. I have to stare at the sky for a full minute while my body decides whether to file what it saw under danger or advertisement or both. Cal materializes beside me at the corner like he always does. He has a Band-Aid on his finger I didn’t see yesterday. He wiggles it at me as if pointing.

“Day one,” he says, and smiles like he’s trying to sell me something he made with his hands. “We do the drawing today. Two breaths. Maybe three. No extra credit.”

“You sound like a coach,” I tell him.

“You sound scared,” he says. Not cruel. Not even a little.

“I’m a little,” I admit, and he nods. We are the most honest people in Irving by accident.

We skip breakfast so I don’t have to stand under the moth-shaped shadow by the kitchen window. We cut across a lot where a house used to be and somebody planted sunflowers as if to fix it. The sunflowers turn their faces in the direction I’m supposed to go. I go.

At school, Ms. Lowry looks at me with a new shape to her eyes, as if she can tell I have a plan. Plans smell like mint and something burned. She doesn’t say anything. Saying nothing is sometimes the bravest thing an adult can do.

In English, Mrs. Dannel collects our essays about origins. My first sentence reads: I come from a room that moved without me. The last reads: I come from the horses that don’t stop running even when they are just metal. She calls me up afterward to ask if everything at home is okay. I tell her yes because it is, in the way that you can define home by its firmness and kindness and number of doors. She says, “You look tired.” I say, “I am working hard on something,” and she nods without asking what it is, and I love her for that.

At lunch, Dre raises his eyebrows when I walk past. He mimes a spider with his fingers, and I keep my face like a road no one’s allowed to turn on. Cal is already outside, sitting under a crepe myrtle that drops little pink confetti on his shoulders. He holds up the notebook and points at the drawing we printed and taped last night. The roach looks like a small fossil. A fragile thing, a stamp of a thing. I look and my stomach imagines a rollercoaster. I breathe once. Two. Three. The world remains in place, like a kind of science.

“See?” he says. “Not dead.”

“Not dead,” I say. The word has two Ds and they turn into anchors as soon as the air touches them.

“Tonight we add one more picture,” he says, businesslike. “Still drawings. Still antique. We don’t level up until you can yawn.”

“I never yawn,” I say through a yawn that tries to wreck me. “Shut up,” I add, laughing. If you can laugh at yourself, other people have less room to get at you with their knives.

In biology, Ms. Lowry lets me sit by the back sink, where the faucet leaks steady as a metronome. She keeps the terrariums shut. We label parts of a flower instead of anything else. The room is still a room, not a moving target, even if my eyes have learned a hundred ways to check the corners. After class, she stops me at the door. “You did that,” she says, not saying what that is. “You did it.”

“No, I breathed,” I tell her.

“Same difference,” she says, and winks in a way that makes me think of grandmothers I never had.

Not everybody builds you ladders. Some people toss down rope and then pull it away for the laugh when you reach. In the hallway, Dre steps into my space and backs me up against the lockers with a look like he’s just doing breathing exercises and I am the breathing. “Heard you fainted,” he says. “Gonna do it again? Because that was fun.”

“Find new hobbies,” I say. My hands are fists but low. Cal moves in and then stops, because he’s learned I don’t always want him to be the fist. He lets his body take up space without being an event. He says, “You deaf? He said no.”

“I didn’t ask you,” Dre says to him, without turning. His eyes keep cutting into mine, sharp and cheap. “Bug boy,” he adds, because he doesn’t have any poetry and power is measured in how often you can say a name like a bruise.

“Look,” I say, and surprise myself because I do. I pull the notebook out. I open to the page. There is the little drawing, antique and controlled. My hand holds it like a flat bravery. “I’m working on this. You can laugh, or you can shut up, or you can help me turn the page.”

For a second I see it. Something in his face stutters. There’s a choke in his breath like he fell wrong in gym class. He opens his mouth. Maybe that was the wrong move because then he sees how to make it a right one for him. “You’re so proud you can look at a picture?” he says, and the Jays do that cough-laugh teenagers do when they want to become more air than person.

“Yeah,” I say, holding the page up like a flag. “I am.”

Sometimes the bravest thing is to say exactly what you are, in public. Sometimes the stupidest thing is to do the same. I am learning the difference.

That afternoon on the way home, Cal buys us two gas station sodas with change he swears he found and I assume he charmed off someone. We sit on the curb behind the 7-Eleven and watch a line of ants cross from the cracks in the concrete to a smear of something that used to be donut. “Don’t look,” he says quickly as soon as the line registers in his voice.

“It’s okay,” I say, and my mouth shocks me with the fact of the words. “From here. It’s just lines.” I keep my eyes unfocused so they’re dots. I practice the breath that understands the difference between a movement that comes at you and a movement that does not.

I think of the thread on the computer screen. All those strangers who typed into a box and waited for someone to type back like a bottle in a digital ocean with a note that says I can’t swim, can you. I think of the username with cicada in it. I think of how you can change your name and something still knows you.

At home, I tape another drawing into the notebook. Cal sits cross-legged on the floor and narrates: “Day two: The drawing is bigger. The heart is also bigger. Coincidence? Scientists say no. The subject’s friend continues to be devastatingly handsome and also right.”

“Shut up,” I say, grinning, because sometimes it’s medication. The drawing is of a beetle with little perfect legs that look like stitches. I look. I breathe. I close the book before my breath trys to run away. “That’s enough,” I say and he says, “That’s enough.”

I know what you’re thinking. That this is a small thing, and the world is not made of small things, it is made of rockets and guns and hurricanes and lovers. I think that too. And yet. Every day is a stack of small things pretending to be a big thing. If you can unstack them, maybe you can hold this one strange teetering pile without letting it fall.

Night again. The sound in the trees like electricity and also like history. Vic sits at the table balancing the receipts for groceries with his thumb, muttering numbers that make the world possible. Maribel has her hair up in a knot like a lighthouse. Baxter decides he is a lapdog and fails. Dre stomps through the room singing something the radio taught him that rhymes girl with world, bad with sad. The little kids fight with plastic swords and all survive.

A moth gets in through the screen in the kitchen, or what looks like a moth. I freeze. My body votes for flight with all its ballots. The moth prints itself against the bulb for a second and then slides down the wall like a little ghost leaving. Cal reaches over and turns off the light. The moth has nothing to smash itself on now. It finds the window the way a prayer does, by accident. We stand in the dark for a minute that could be a year.

“See?” he whispers. “Better.”

“Maybe,” I say. The dark is a trick, too. It has fewer answers than light, but also fewer questions. It rests on us like a hand.

We climb the stairs. He stops me at the landing. “You know I’ll keep reading,” he says. “You know I’ll sit there and read every screen and tell you only the parts you can use.”

“Like you’re my translator,” I say, and my smile feels like a new muscle. “Like you’re my mother tongue.”

He looks like he wants to say something else and then decides not to. Something flickers in his eye like a fish in a creek. He presses his palm briefly to the notebook in my hands, as if blessing it. “Night,” he says, and goes to his room—or maybe he doesn’t. Maybe he never quite leaves, even when the door slants shut and the cicadas take up their old, ancient, electric hymn.

I lay awake a long time. I count breaths like coins I will put into the machine that gives you another life. At some point I get up and stand by the window and watch Irving sit under the heat like it put it on like a shirt and forgot to take it off. A police car’s red-and-blue washes the corner for a second and then goes. Someone laughs in the alley in a way that means beer. A distant train says its long narrow vowel.

I press my forehead to the glass where the moth sat this morning. The glass feels like a forehead too, laid against mine. You think you’re alone and then you’re not. You think your best friend is a person who texts you pictures of bugs you can survive, and then maybe you learn he’s also the part of your brain that doesn’t leave the room. There are worse twins to have.

I whisper, to nobody and somebody both: “Tomorrow we add a real photo.” The words hang in the room like clothes on a line. They smell like soap, and the faintest bit of fear, and the first clean day after rain. The cicadas keep insisting. And I decide to insist back.Chapter 3

The cicadas are already working the edges of the morning when I open my eyes, like somebody left a radio on low and forgot the switch. The window glass holds the ghost of last night’s moth, a smudge where it pressed its soft geometry and went. I count the four cracks in the paint above my bunk and think of them as roads out of the map. I tell myself one of those roads leads to a picture I can look at without my chest flipping the close sign. I tell myself that road has shoulders where you can pull over if you need to throw up.

Downstairs, Vic has a box of cereal open like a book he doesn’t want to read and a gallon of milk that is more aspiration than liquid. He pours equal parts of each, which means he apologizes with the coffee again, and the little ones grate their spoons over the bowls like they’re playing a tiny drum solo. Baxter menaces the baseboards with his nose as if the house is hiding a treat. Dre shuffles through in socks and his T-shirt from some summer league complaining about the weather as if he didn’t choose to live here too. Maribel has her hair in two braids, and she is buttoning a shirt that says Night Shift like an advertisement for a planet I never want to visit.

“Big day?” Vic says, like he knows every calendar we keep in our heads, the ones with circles around the parts where we think we might die.

“Just a day,” I say. My voice tries for casual and lands on almost. I slide another slice of toast into the toaster and watch it become itself, browning like a sunrise that knows better than to celebrate.

Cal texts before I can finish chewing: Outside. He never writes more than he needs to. The message is a knock you hear in your blood. I leave the toast and the apology coffee and the chatter and step out into a street that still looks damp with heat, as if the air sweated in its sleep.

He’s leaning against the mailbox with that slant that says he’s invented gravity for himself and will share it if you ask nice. His phone is in his hand. The screen is a little cracked at the corner like a smile with one chipped tooth. He looks at me and his eyes do that check they do, the one that inventories five thousand facts in a blink and files them under okay or not yet.

“Two breaths,” he says. “Then three if you can. We don’t have to hit extra today.”

“You sound like a gym app,” I tell him, and he grins because he knows that if he were an app it would nag you into drinking water and then applaud when you finished.

He holds the phone like it’s a small bird, careful not to crush. The picture on it is a roach, not glossy, not dramatic—just a photograph torn from a world where people don’t understand the power of their cameras. Its legs are little knotted threads. Its back is a suit of armor I never want to wear. The light in the picture is bad, the way real life is under fluorescent. I look for exactly one breath. The breath is longer than some entire days.

My throat learns a new shape. I look for a second breath and my palms hallucinate sweat. It is sweat. My bones argue about the exits. The world does not end. The mailbox remains a mailbox and not a coffin. The cicadas keep drilling their tiny nails into the morning.

“Two,” he says, and it feels like he is counting steps down a ladder I built last night while everyone else was asleep. “Good. Enough. Put your eyes on my face now.”

I do. His face is a geography I understand: the way the scar on his knuckle pales when he’s holding something tight, the way his hair refuses to obey the rules of physics or brush, the way his eyebrows can ask questions indelicate enough to get us in trouble. I look at him until the picture in my head quiets into a corner and bites its nails. Then we walk.

The bus is late the way buses dream of being late, enough to remind you you’re not in charge. The billboard with the lawyer and his teeth has changed to a bank that says Dream Bigger with a sunset stolen from a place that is not Irving. The boy in the Batman shirt is not at the stop this morning, and I feel his absence like a missing tooth. There’s a grasshopper on the metal bench and I sit on the curb instead of next to it because I don’t need my morning to have springs. Cal sits on the curb too without making a ceremony of it. We look like little kings, or beggars, or boys, depending on who drives by and narrates us in their head.

At school, Coach Ramirez claps his palm against mine as I pass the gym. His hand is a piece of furniture, sturdy and used for useful things. “You still owe me a later,” he says, like he didn’t even notice I left it on his desk last week.

“After seventh,” I say, surprising both of us. “Fifteen minutes.”

“Fifteen now,” he says, ushering me through a door that smells like old rubber and lemon cleaner. “You shoot. You breathe between. You tell your heart it’s not the only drummer in the band.”

The gym is empty in the way that large rooms become holy when no one is watching. He rolls the ball to me across the floor and it bumps against my foot like a dog. I pick it up. The leather is scuffed, and when I hold it my hands stop thinking about other things. I shoot ugly, which is to say, honest. The ball arcs wrong and skims the rim and I laugh because the rim doesn’t care. Coach rebounds with the grace of someone who has decided to age slowly just to be petty about it. He doesn’t say much. He lets the echo do the talk, the way some people let the ocean explain itself. I shoot again. My breathing remembers what it is to be a metronome instead of an alarm.

“You’re a rhythm kid,” he says when I stop to drink water that tastes like pipes. “All that noise out there? It’s begging you to sync it to something that doesn’t break you.”

“I don’t know how yet,” I say. “I can’t find the knob.”

“That’s what later is for,” he says. “You bring it in pieces. We build it back weird and strong.”

First period, Mrs. Dannel has us pass our origin essays to the left. The class clown who loves pasta reads mine and says, “Wow,” in a voice that could be an insult or a tiny cathedral. She asks if she can read a paragraph out loud, and I nod, and when she does, nobody laughs. The part where I wrote about the horses hits the room like a wind. Somebody coughs to cover the fact that they felt it. Somebody else says, “That’s dope,” like we are all allowed to use that word. I fold myself back into my chair with a care that is almost love.

Third period is biology. Ms. Lowry meets my eyes from across the room before I can meet hers and tilts her head toward the lab like a person who’s going to introduce you to someone you’re not sure about. On her desk is a plastic tub with holes punched in the lid, and the holes are enough information to make my ribs convert to a xylophone. The terrariums are covered with a towel the color of hospital sheets. She’s put a sticky note on the towel that says Rest, like a command to the wild.

“Eli,” she says, keeping her voice in the lane where it belongs. “It’s feed day. You don’t have to be eyes-on. You can do labels at the back sink. You can stand at the door. You can take a hall pass and walk until the air makes sense. But you can’t be missing from yourself. Understand?”

“I can be near, but not in,” I say, like I’m drawing a boundary with chalk and a ruler. “I can be brave with rules.”

“That’s my favorite kind of brave,” she says, and her smile has edges on purpose.

I go to the back sink and open my notebook. The drawing from last night sits there, taped down like a specimen that won’t crawl. Behind me, Ms. Lowry lifts the towel. There’s the sound of glass adjusting to new light. There’s the steady tick of water leaking like a patient at a clinic. There’s the small bell sound when a cricket hits the side of a terrarium as it learns what walls are. There’s me, holding a pencil like it’s a straw to breathe through. I do not watch. I count the holes in the acoustic tile ceiling and assign them names like stars. Orion, except he carries a mop and not a club. Casiopeia, except it’s just Coach’s gym whistle in the wrong galaxy.

Somebody behind me whispers, “Bug boy,” and I know the voice without turning. It’s not even a full whisper; it’s a half, like he thinks his power doubles if he only uses part of it. I write a label for petal and one for stamen and one for this feeling is not my forever. Ms. Lowry says a student’s name that is not mine in the register tone she uses when she has had enough. The towel goes back over the terrariums and the room exhales like it’s been holding it for fifteen minutes. I hand in my labels and she says, “Thank you for breathing in my class,” as if it’s a science.

Lunch, Cal and I sit under the crepe myrtle again because it’s already adopted us. The tree skeins pink little papers down into my hair and he pretends to pick them out like he’s dignified. He pulls the notebook from my bag and flips to the page with the drawing as if it’s a deck and he’s about to do a trick. Sitting there on white is our new picture—printed off Ray’s old black-and-white printer in the library like a compromise with the century. The roach is worse in black-and-white. It is all outline and secrecy, a silhouette you could mistake for a leaf until it is not.

“We do three,” he says. “Then we steal a fry and reward ourselves like dogs.”

“I’m more of a cat,” I say. “I’ll decide later, and then I won’t come when you call.”

We look. We breathe. On the second breath I feel the elevator drop in my stomach and I put my hand on the ground to remind my body of the fact of concrete. Cal doesn’t touch me, which is the touch I need most. On the third breath I think of the horses, not moving, and how they still seem fast. Then I exhale so long it feels like a rope out of my mouth back to the rest of the room.

After lunch, Dre wanders through the hallway with his satellites and does a little dance-step when he sees me, just enough to suggest a spider with his fingers. He thinks he invented Opera Mime. I look at his shoes because they are new and too white, and I think about how hard it is to keep anything white in Irving. I think about the effort behind anything that looks easy. For once, I feel sorry for him, which is a feeling my therapist, if I had one, would probably call progress and I call exhausting.

“Later,” Coach says, ambushing me with a ball after seventh. He doesn’t care that my shirt clings to my back like a second, sweaty shirt. He tosses a rebound from the free throw line that sings when it hits the net, which is a sound I would put under my pillow if I knew how to keep sounds. He shows me where to place the pads of my fingers and how to bend my knees so I don’t look like I’m borrowing someone else’s body. “Every shot is a breath,” he says, and I get it, stupid as it sounds. Every shot starts small and is also bigger than you think, like fear, like love, like the plan we made with the computer thread that lives in the library now like a small god with a pale grey shrine.

On the way out, Ray at the desk says, “We close at five today,” without looking up. He moves his hand over the stamp pad with a grace that is more about not wasting motion than about style. I ask him if the old printers can do color. He says, “They can, if you whisper,” deadpan, and Cal shoots me a look like, see, everyone in Irving is a secret comedian.

In the computer corner, the screensavers float over pictures of mountains I’ve never seen and corners of cities I might, if the world stays intact long enough. Cal logs in and pulls up the thread. New posts have stacked themselves since last time, a slow cairn of other people’s attempts. AFK_Cicada has replied to somebody about centipedes with the kind of empathy that makes me think of a hand under a table that finds your knee and says, without words, here. There’s a reply to our first, tentative comment from last night, the one where Cal wrote in third person about a boy named E. who wants a new brain.

It says: Hey, E. Ladders are good. Ropes are good. Nets are good. What you’re building is all of those. For what it’s worth, I started with line drawings, then grayscale photos, then color. Sound last. Movement last of last. If it helps: the mind has one job—keep you alive, even if it’s bad at telling what is dead already and what isn’t. Praise it for trying. Then teach it new tricks. Also, because you’re in Texas and I can hear your trees: cicadas are not coming for you. They’re just doing their math out loud.

Cal reads it in a whisper like a prayer and laughs at the last part, soft. “Your trees,” he says. “Like you own them.”

“I’d sell,” I say, and my hand shakes a little anyway. He scrolls to an attached PDF that looks like it was printed in 2004 on a printer that chewed paper and then repented. It’s a list of steps that sound like the ones we’re taking, with checkboxes you could fill if you believed in checkmarks. We print it and the printer whines a little and then coughs out two pages with a stripe through them like the world wants us to strain to read. We carry the pages like diplomas.

Back at Leland, there’s a truck idling at the curb with a cartoon roach on the side in a red circle with a bar like it’s not allowed to exist. The font is cheerful in a way that makes my teeth hurt. For a second, my knees do that dance they do when they’re trying to be birds. Vic is on the porch with his elbows on his knees talking to a man in a shirt tucked too neatly into his pants. The man has a clipboard. He has the face of a person who has seen basements and has opinions about them. He turns as I come up the walk and his eyes do not settle on me, which I appreciate in a stranger. He looks at the trim and the corners and the long crack that runs like a river down the foundation where the house settled in a hurry and no one remembered to tell it not to.

“Quarterly,” Vic says, as if we have quarters, as if our year is cash. “Just the gel and the traps. I know the drill.”

“Yeah,” the man says. “Standard. You’ll see a few more at first. Then you’ll see less. Then you’ll think they’re gone. They’re never gone.”

“Like grief,” Maribel says from the door, and the man blinks and writes something on his form like, under residents: poets.

I want to go upstairs and put my head under a pillow so deep I come out in China. I want to run into the alley and let the sound of a passing plane grind the thought out of my head. Instead I sit on the steps and tie my shoes with a focus that could cut wood. Cal sits next to me and narrates the procedure under his breath like a nature show for one. “Here we observe the native adult male in his habitat, laying down sticky offerings for the gods of hygiene. Notice his careful placement along baseboards, the sacred path of those who prefer the dark.”

“Stop,” I say, because laughing makes this worse and better, and I don’t know which I need.

The man goes inside. Baxter goes after him because Baxter believes in welcoming committees that are mostly elbows. Vic leans down to me like he’s lowering a rope I can refuse or climb. “You want to take a walk with Maribel and the kids?” he asks. “Or you want to sit on the back steps and learn to be bored with me while a professional argues with the bugs about our terms?”

“I’ll take the bored,” I say. The kids are already bouncing off the window like fish trying to understand air. Dre is in the corner of the living room pretending he doesn’t notice the truck in the street, his mouth set in the line that means he’s waiting for his moment like a quiz show contestant with itchy fingers.

We sit on the back steps, Vic and me and Cal, and the alley smells like hot trash and something blooming in spite of it. The fence along the neighbor’s yard hums with bees drunk on whatever the honeysuckle decided to offer. Cal snaps a blade of St. Augustine grass and peels it into thinner and thinner strings until his lap looks like a tiny basket. Vic tells us about a dog he had when he was a kid that was afraid of thunder, how it would climb into the bathtub and sit there shaking like a small storm inside a larger one.

“What’d you do?” I ask, because the answer matters in the way that some folklore is actually math.

“Sat on the floor and hummed,” he says. “She liked the Beach Boys. I was eleven. It was the best I could do.” He shrugs. “Sometimes it’s still the best I can do.”

We hear the little sticky thunks as the traps go down, the sound of paper coming unstuck from itself. We hear the gel gun click, click, a mechanical insect more controllable than the kind I can’t. We hear Baxter’s tags jingle as he patrols the kitchen with the pest guy like he’s learning a trade. I breathe through my mouth a little so my nose doesn’t go to war with my brain over the chemical smell. Cal taps his foot in a rhythm that’s not the cicadas, and I match it, heel to toe, heel to toe, like we’re sending secret codes by ankle.

Inside, there’s a sound I know too well: the sudden hard-footed scuttle of something that learned its body in a place where light rarely visits. It appears in the corner of my vision like a habit. The man says, “There you are,” in a voice you’d use to an old friend, and then there’s a slap and a silence that is worse and better both. Vic doesn’t move. Cal doesn’t move. I keep my eyes on the sky because the sky is terrible at surprises.

“Good,” I say, and I don’t know who I’m talking to. Maybe the pro. Maybe me. Maybe the thing that lived here with us rent-free.

After, the man comes out and writes the date on a paper in the tidy script of someone who got in trouble for sloppy eights. He says, “Give it a week.” He says, “Don’t use sprays. You mess with their social lives that way.” He says, “Call if you see anything biblical.” He drives away, and the cartoon roach on the side of his truck looks over its shoulder like it forgot its wallet.

Inside, the kitchen smells like a hospital with a sense of humor. Vic opens windows like he’s letting the house breathe after a long story. Baxter brings us a sticky trap with one ant stuck by one leg as if to demonstrate a moral that doesn’t fit. I look and I don’t look. I feel the usual typhoon in my chest start and subside the way a song does when you remember the next verse.

Dre shows up in the doorway at the far end of the hall. His eyes do a race across my face like he’s scouting for a weakness to plant a flag in. He looks at the traps and then back at me as if they are a present I should open in front of him. “You want me to test these?” he says, and there’s enough sugar in his voice to rot twelve teeth.

“No,” I say, and the word lands on the floor with a hunk. “I want you to not. I want you to leave the room where I live because I have to live in it.”

He laughs, but it’s thinner than yesterday. He glances at Vic, who lifts his eyebrows into a caution sign. Dre’s face does a little twist like a storm trying and failing to spin up. He shrugs and disappears, and my legs do the trembling they saved for after.

We go to our spot on the floor between the couch and the table and begin the new step because that’s what the ladder tells us to do. Cal pulls out the printed grayscale picture and lays it on the rug like a card we’re playing for rent. This time, I hold the paper. This time, my fingers touch the edges where the picture stops. The edges are important because my brain likes borders. I look. I breathe. I talk to my heart like it is not the only drum in the band. I say, out loud, because saying things out loud puts a spell on them, “Picture. Paper. Not moving. No smell. No sound.” Cal murmurs the words with me like harmony.

We add a checkmark on the page we printed, even though the checkmarks are for people who think checkmarks solve anything. It solves the need to do the next one. We stick the paper in the notebook like pressed leaves we’ll look at later and marvel over without crying. The little kids run through the room with swords made of pool noodles, hitting each other and the couch and the air, which always loses and always comes back. Maribel snaps a dish towel at them like a queen with a very soft whip and the room fractures into laughter and counters and crunch of something under someone’s shoe that is, thank God, only a piece of cereal.

Later, when the house slumps into the shape of evening like it does—TV low, somebody halfway asleep on the stairs for no reason, somebody else drawing a dragon in the same notebook for an hour like time is elastic—we go to the library because the air there is still better than ours. Ray nods at us and taps the sign that says No Food with one knuckle like wink Morse code. We sit in the far computer station, the one under the air vent that makes you feel like someone is breathing on you in a non-creepy way.

There’s another reply from AFK_Cicada. It says: Proud of you for paper, E. Your friend is a piece of your nervous system. Tell him thanks from an old stranger who wishes he’d had one. Re: pictures: color is an argument; grayscale is a speech. Neither can bite. When you’re ready, try color thumbnails. Print them small. You are allowed to look with your hand over most of it, like you’re looking through a keyhole. The brain loves keyholes. It thinks it’s stealing, and it’s more relaxed when it’s a thief.

Cal reads this with the proper respect. He taps the screen with one finger like a kiss. He types back without asking me what to say because he knows. He writes: We did paper. We breathed. We didn’t die. He writes: How long until movement? He writes: Asking for a friend who is me.

The answer doesn’t come, because the internet is not a genie; it’s a room where people bring their folding chairs and sometimes sit. We print three tiny color pictures anyway, photographs that look like someone took them on a dare: a beetle with a skin like oiled wood, a fly with eyes that look like little neighborhoods, a roach that is small because we printed it that way and because I asked Cal to make it small. He cuts the pictures with child scissors that leave scalloped edges, as if we are making a scrapbook out of parts of my fear.

On the way out, the sun has laid itself low and heavy on Rochelle, and the canal horses are bronze under it like coins in a fountain nobody threw on purpose. We go visit them even though we don’t have time. Cal climbs the low wall and stands on it like a lifeguard of stone and I stand below and look at the horses’ open mouths. You could climb in and sit where the teeth would be if they were alive. You could tell your fear a story from there and make it listen. Cal spits into the water and we watch the ripples find the hoofs and decide they don’t care. I count the ripples out of habit. I count until I forget what counting is for.

Back home, Vic is fighting with a receipt and a jar of change. He is losing to both in a dignified way. He looks up as we come in and his eyes do a quick assessment. He says, “Supper is a suggestion,” which means there are frozen items and a microwave and nobody is going to judge you if you eat the rest of the cereal out of the box. Dre sits at the table with a deck of cards wearing the face of someone who learned a new trick and is trying to decide if it will make him liked. He watches me and then doesn’t. He’s trying to find a new hobby, I can hear it walking around in his head like a person in an upstairs apartment.

We tape the tiny pictures into the notebook. We do the keyhole thing like we’re thieves. I cover the roach with my palm and lift a corner and breathe like it’s a message. My eye touches only the fragment I allow it: the curve of a back, a implicated leg. The feeling that wants to be an earthquake moves through me like a wave through a sports stadium, rising and falling, not all at once, not enough to bring anything down. Cal sits cross-legged, his knee knocking mine with a rhythm we don’t name. We do it twice. We do it three times. We go make microwaved burritos like we’re normal.

Night finds us because it always does and it brings its choir with it. The cicadas tune themselves against the edges of the day and rip the song open. I sit on the floor by the window with the notebook in my lap and the printed steps like a sermon folded under the cover. Cal texts from the other room a picture of his ceiling with a crack I haven’t seen before and says, This looks like a river. I write back, This looks like a map. He writes back, I like maps. I write, I like rivers if someone else is rowing. He writes, I know how, and I believe him in a way that makes sleep less adversarial.

Just before the houses in the alley let their air go thin and the night takes over the temperature entirely, there’s a sound downstairs like laughter dragged over gravel. The little kids have found a video with something screaming in it again, and Maribel’s voice is the kind that could put a helmet on a wind. She says, “Off,” and after three seconds of whining and two of negotiation, it is. The silence afterwards tastes like clean teeth.

I think of my mother’s voice across the motel room, the way it frayed at the edges when money was an idea instead of an object. I think of the brown shape lifting and running and the carpet going with it. I think of telling that story like a joke someday, and having it land like somebody set the room right. I think of telling it to Cal and having him stop me halfway because he already knows the end. This is what origin means sometimes: not where you are from but where you go when you’re afraid and who meets you there without clapping.

I write in the notebook, because that is my church and my school both, Day 3: Color pictures. Small. Keyhole. I write, Laughed twice today. I write, Sat back of lab. I write, Didn’t run. I draw a square and cut it into quarters with a line and a line and fill one with a dumb smiley face like I’m eight. Cal slips a note under my door without knocking that says, Tomorrow we try sound, tiny and from far away, if and only if. He has underlined if and only if three times like a spell.

I lay down. I look at the moth’s ghost on the glass and press my forehead to it until the warmth comes back to both of us. Baxter patrols the hallway and then decides to sleep at my door like he’s a guard and I’m a king and this is a castle. The cicadas insist. And I begin to hum, a dumb Beach Boys song I found in my head like a coin in a couch. It sounds stupid in my mouth and then it sounds less like stupid and more like today. It’s all rhythm anyway. It’s all breath if you squint. I hum and I promise my heart and the picture and the invisible animal downstairs that doesn’t live here anymore that in the morning, if we can bear it, we will try a clip with the sound off. If we cannot, we will try a new way to breathe. There are a hundred doors. Some of them open on the same room, yes, but sometimes the light is different, and that has to be enough.Chapter 5

The morning wears the same shirt as last night and doesn’t bother to change. The cicadas keep their shift, faithful as a factory, and the crack in my ceiling that Cal called a river now looks like a road where tiny cars refuse to crash. I listen to the house and rate its noises. Baxter’s tail drums the baseboard like a kid in band who hasn’t learned the rest of the song. The toaster complains as if toasting is philosophy. Vic hums something with surf in it because once he told me the Beach Boys kept a dog from breaking, and now he uses their harmonies on houses and on boys. I lie there a minute after I open my eyes and count to five while staring at nothing, because five isn’t a ladder and isn’t not a ladder, it’s just a number that makes my heart slow down enough to hear the bus hiss two streets over as it kneels to let on somebody who might be me.

Cal texts me a picture of his shoe on the curb and writes, Move, which is generous for someone who could have sent a spider emoji just to see if we’ve lived long enough to make it a joke. I drag on a shirt that doesn’t smell like fear because I keep two in a drawer for days like this, and I pass Baxter’s solemn face at the top of the stairs. He thumps his tail once like a judge approving a petition. In the kitchen, the apology coffee tastes less like apology and more like persistence, and Vic puts a hand on my shoulder in a way that says he would pick me up and put me where I need to go if I asked, but I won’t. The little ones argue about whether Batman could beat a shark with a lightsaber and invent a physics I prefer to school.

“Sound today?” Vic asks, and his voice has no challenge in it, only math. I nod, and he doesn’t say brave. He just slides me the better toast because love sometimes is the piece with the less-burnt corner. Dre is at the table buttering two slices like he’s painting a fence he plans to jump and he glances up once and glances away again, the way boys do when they’re pretending not to have a planet inside their chests.

The air outside is already sticky with someone else’s ambition. Cal leans on the mailbox again like he’s willing to be furniture if that helps me stand, and he lifts his phone like a priest lifts a relic. “We don’t have to,” he says, and his eyebrows ask sixteen questions in one move. “We can stay at paper for a week. We can be fans of monochrome for life.”

“I want to see if the world explodes,” I tell him, grinning because maybe smiling at disaster makes it less interested in me. He holds up a video with the volume off and the speed at a crawl, and the bug inside that frame is only a scribble with too many joints, a line that remembers it used to be a shadow. We count breaths over it the way you count train cars as they pass to prove you lived long enough to see the caboose. On the second breath my throat tries to close its shop. On the third breath nothing in the street changes color or catches fire, so we go to the bus and do the thing you do in this city, which is pretend the heat is a personality flaw instead of a condition.

On the bus I sit in the front again because there are fewer floors to watch, and Cal stands because his balance is better than most people’s intentions. The Batman boy is back and has a Band-Aid on his elbow that glows like a badge. He tells his mother in a voice of absolute monarchy that he is still king of the ants, and she says, “Okay, Your Majesty,” without looking up from her phone, and I watch her mouth curve without her permission. The billboard has changed locations but not content, a lawyer with teeth or a bank with sunset, and every ad in Texas believes we want to be rescued or rich. I want to make it two breaths at a volume I can name.

We stop here and stop there and float toward school in a metal can. Cal shows me the slider on the phone screen and moves it a hair, a nothing, a suggestion, and the sound that emerges is like a mosquito from two houses away complaining about an HOA. He keeps his eyes on my face and I keep my eyes on the part of the phone that is not movement, and we get to school intact enough that Coach can say my name like he’s put a jersey on it. He claps my palm and doesn’t let it go right away. “Later,” he says, and I say, “Fifteen,” because debt paid in minutes is a language we both speak without accent.

First period we edit each other’s essays, and the class clown who wrote about pasta draws a noodle in the margin next to the sentence about the horses and writes, This line slaps, which is criticism I didn’t know how to want and now want laminated. Mrs. Dannel keeps handing back papers like she’s returning parts of ourselves we forgot in her room last week, and when she gets to me she says, “You kept the verbs honest,” and it feels like she noticed the place I put the map. Her hair frizzes at the edges like she walked through the weather, and her bracelet clicks when she writes a note on the board about run-on sentences as if to demonstrate noise you can live with.

Biology is third and the air in that room remembers long-dead frogs the way some houses remember arguments. Ms. Lowry has the terrariums under towels again, and she’s written Rest in bubble letters today as if the creatures under there are reading. She lifts a plastic paperweight off her desk as I come in, a clear block with something brown inside that looks like a brooch from a museum. “A friend,” she says, and sets it on my lab station like a charm. “Sealed in. You could lick it and not catch a thing. Please don’t, but I know you needed to hear it.”

I stare at the block from the side first because refraction does me kindnesses. The beetle inside looks like old furniture and the lines of its legs look stitched on with a needle, and when I lay my palm flat on the resin it is warm from the light and not from anything alive. Cal isn’t in this class but I can hear him anyway, the way you hear a road even when the car stops. I breathe and I touch and I tell my brain stories. It listens like a skeptical uncle who will come around if you buy him a soda.

“Good,” Ms. Lowry says, not whispering it, not making it holy. She sets a stack of diagrams next to the block and points at petal and stamen and ovary like she’s giving me other words I can use while my breath counts alone. Behind me someone snickers a little and says my name half-formed, and I don’t turn because I am not a door you get to open by guessing my hinge. Lowry’s “Enough” goes out into the room like a net and catches whatever needed to be caught. We label flowers. We pretend this is about reproduction and not survival, and for a few minutes I’m just a kid with pencil smudges willing to call a leaf a leaf even if my body wants every green thing to hide.

At lunch Cal is already under the crepe myrtle with three french fries like prizes in his open palm and a straw he peels into strings while he watches me approach. “Two breaths?” he says, and I say, “Three if the wind is on my side,” and we hold the phone together like a small fragile thing that could learn to fly if we are polite. The sound now is a whisper that might be the phone’s own guts humming, and the movement is a blur I refuse to name. On breath two my eyes water and I do not blink. On breath three I set the phone on my knee and look at a car driving past with a dent in the side door that looks like a sunflower and I decide the car is more important than the bug. Cal passes me a fry and I do not throw up, which feels like winning a prize I didn’t know was in the game.

Dre appears in the periphery of our tree like he always does, as if he has lodged himself in my orbit and can’t find a new one that feels as warm. He rocks back on his heels and lets the Jays orbit him like moons while he does his little hand dance that suggests eight legs and no mercy. “You run from a picture again?” he asks, and his voice wants to be rich and fails. Cal sits up straighter without getting taller, a trick I haven’t learned yet. I hold up the notebook instead of answering and show him the checkboxes with shaky little Xs like a toddler’s homework pinned to a fridge. He squints as if the boxes are a test he didn’t study for.

“It’s a ladder,” I say, because sometimes you don’t get to be clever and you have to be blunt. “I’m building a ladder because the house is on fire in a part I can’t see and I’m not interested in dying in that room. You don’t have to like it. You can even laugh. But you’re not blowing it down this time.”

For a flicker, there’s something like recognition in his face, some muscle memory of being eight and wanting someone to tell him where to put his hands. The Jays wait to see which version of Dre they get this period and who that makes them. He looks at the notebook and then at Cal, and then he shrugs like a person trying not to say “okay.” “Ladder,” he says, and turns away because you can’t always give a boy the dignity of being witnessed while he decides not to be a knife.

After seventh, I go to Coach because later is a debt that makes you honest. The gym smells like rubber before rain and the floor gleams in the way that floors do when someone loves them enough to make them shine. He rolls me the ball and I shoot ugly with my feet too planted because my body thinks stillness is safety. He laughs and shows me where to put the frenzy, how to let my knees be springs without logging myself as prey. We count breaths and count dribbles and he says, “Noise makes its own weather. You be a barometer, not a kite,” and I don’t get it entirely but my hands do, and that’s enough.

We go to the library because there is no day too crowded for a visit to a room that smells like paper and better decisions. Ray slides a stack of returns across the desk with the efficiency of a magician shuffling a deck you thought you had memorized. On the corner of his terminal is a paperweight with a beetle inside, amber instead of acrylic, old honey with a dark God in the middle. He sees my glance and taps it twice. “He keeps the hold slips from flying,” he says, which is practical and also terrible poetry. I lift it. It’s heavier than the acrylic block, warmer and stickier in the mind, and when I put it down my palm prints a map of sweat where it sat.

“New posts,” Cal says in the computer corner, and I sit with my ceiling river crack and my breath while he reads. AFK_Cicada has written about relapse like a boulder in a stream. It says: Setbacks are not betrayals. They are weather. You got wet. Dry off. Start from one rung lower and you’re still higher than when you were on the ground. It says: Pair hard sounds with a soft smell if you can, a smell your brain recognizes as survival. For me it was cinnamon toast. For some it’s old coffee. For some it’s their dad’s aftershave. Find something older than the fear and invite it to the party.

“Apology coffee,” I say, and Cal clicks his tongue because he knows I keep that smell in my bones. He prints the line about smell like it’s a spell, and we fold it into the notebook so it can bruise the page with wisdom and ink. We print three thumbnails in color with the printer’s cartridge deciding it’s tired and giving one of them a halo of green that makes it look like a saint. We cut the saints out and paste them down and practice the keyhole method with my hand as a door and my fingers as a lock, and each time we let a fraction through, my heart learns the difference between an ambush and a slideshow. When I look up Ray is watching without watching and he nods once and stamps a due date with the authority of someone who knows time can be made to behave.

That night at Leland House chaos runs played-out routes. The little ones discover a box of costumes left over from a fundraiser and all become doctors and dragons and one becomes a nurse because she likes the pockets. Maribel corrals them with the towel and the ladle like a cape and a scepter. Vic marks something on the calendar in a square that reads State Inspection and the words make the entire building hold its breath like a pool of synchronized swimmers. “Tomorrow,” he says. “They come look under everything. You all got ten corners each. We’re gonna be the kind of tidy that makes ants feel judged.”

The traps along the baseboards look like small black houses where bad news goes to sit. I take the hall as my ten corners and Cal volunteers for the kitchen because he believes in wrestling monsters on their turf. We move furniture and find lost pennies and a Lego flashlight without batteries and the fossil of a nougat wrapper. The smell of the gel the pest man laid down is still a thin bitter along the edges of the air. Baxter acts like he’s the inspector, nosing each corner and sneezing like the government wronged him. Dre drifts in and out of the chores like weather, sometimes pouring Windex like it paid him rent, sometimes vanishing as soon as a conversation requires him to sit still. He does not kick a trap or bring one to me like a party favor. He steps over them with an exaggerated disgust I recognize like a word in my first language.

“Beach Boys?” Vic asks, and I hum a little because my voice doesn’t start if my hands are wet. Cal harmonizes badly on purpose and then a little better because he hates to lose, and the kitchen changes shape around our wrong ocean song. Maribel dusts the fake plant in the corner because inspectors love to look at fake plants and judge you for their dust, and the whole room becomes a place where people are trying both too hard and just enough. We pack the notebook in a plastic sleeve like it’s a passport. We go to sleep with the smell of lemon cleaner colonizing our dreams and I wake twice to the sound of something soft winging against the screen and do not run because there is nowhere else to run to.

The inspectors arrive with clipboards and expressions like neutral masks. They are not cruel, which surprises me, and not warm, which does not. One of them glances at the traps and scribbles something that might as well be a weather report. They ask about emergency exits and medications and how we lock the back gate and whether the smoke detector in the end bedroom sings when it should. Vic answers in paragraphs that sound like he practiced hope and taxes at the same time. When they leave, the house exhales and the cicadas pick up their chorus as if we were holding them back with our nervousness.

On Saturday, Coach has open gym and Flaco from geometry convinces Cal to drag me into a pickup game I initially plan to watch from the bleachers like a person who loves a sport in theory but not in math. The game runs too fast for my eyes to stalk the corners, so my brain gives up and lets my body make the decisions it’s been waiting its whole life to make. For seven minutes I forget I have a throat and for three seconds after I make a bank shot that should not have gone in I think I might be a person other than the one I am, and even when I remember myself, I don’t mind. Cal whoops like a siren and slaps my back in a way that would usually make me flinch and I don’t. Coach watches with the satisfied face of someone whose plant finally decided to bloom.

After, I want quiet that isn’t a study hall and air that doesn’t know my name. Cal says, “Creek?” and we walk toward a skinny strip of water that pretends not to be a ditch. The clean-up volunteers in neon vests are already there with those grabber sticks that make you feel like a robot taking out the trash on Mars. The dragonflies patrol their stretch of air like little helicopters in sequins. I can feel their hum before I hear it, and the first one that strafes my ear makes my stomach try to undo lunch. Cal points at the grabber stick and holds it out like a weapon you use on ideas. “We don’t touch,” he says. “We edit.”

I take the stick and gather a film of candy wrappers and a twelve-year-old soda can and a shoelace that might have held together someone’s bad day. The dragonflies do their strafing runs and I practice not ducking as if dignity has a score. A boy from the neighborhood I don’t know whacks a floating plastic bottle like it insulted his mother and laughs a sharp laugh and I see Dre in that split second before the mirror fogs. Cal puts a hand near my elbow and not on it and says, “Pick three bags and quit like a champion,” and I do because we get to set the day’s trophies ourselves if we’re paying attention.

We stop at the canal because I can’t go home without checking that the horses are still not running in a way that convinces me they are. The bronze is hot enough to fry an idea on and the water slaps itself against the concrete edges like a drummer who doesn’t know when to quit. Cal tries to teach me to whistle and I spit instead, which is its own talent. We name the horses again just to make sure they remember us: Library and Gym and Ladder. He wants to call the third one Eli and I shake my head so hard the cicadas skip a beat.

There’s a message from AFK_Cicada when we get back that reads like advice smuggled into a fortune cookie. It says: Movement is a thief. If you can choose where it steals from, you win. Start with clips where the bug is a rumor, not the headline. Sound at a whisper. Pair it with a smell that drags you back to your kitchen. Keep the clip shorter than a sneeze. Three times a day, three days, then add one beat. If it breaks you, don’t call it broken. Call it data. We print it and tape it next to the first steps so our page looks like a shrine to patience built by children with good scissors.

We try it that night at the kitchen table with the light off and the smell of coffee anchoring the room like a post you tie a boat to. Cal pours a little of the apology brew into a mug so fresh steam gives me an assignment. He holds the phone like he’s presenting a baby to a congregation and he pushes play and the thing on the screen scuttles left to right for less than the space of a breath, and the sound is my neighbor’s television through a wall. My calves try to run without me. My spine writes a polite letter asking to leave. I say out loud, “Coffee. Mug. Kitchen. Table. Cal’s dumb hair,” and his hair flares with a dignity that believes it is above adjectives. On the third run my chest stops dragging me toward a cliff and just sighs. We stop there on purpose. We put the phone face-down like we just argued with it and agree to pick up again after dessert.

Dessert is a stale cookie Maribel found in a bag at the back of a cabinet and the laughter the little ones make when she crumbles it over ice cream like an invention. Dre hovers in the door to the patio like a child deciding whether to dive. He watches us with the new eyes of someone who has decided your hobby is not to be mocked but maybe to be understood so he can outdo it. “What’s today,” he asks, not unkind, and I say, “Sound,” because there is no hiding in a house like ours. He nods once and flinches when Baxter sneezes, which is something I have seen twelve times and only now notice as data and not gossip.

Later, when everyone’s rooms are full of the noises people make when they are trying to find the spot where sleep begins, Cal texts me a picture of a roach costume from a Halloween store and writes, Not yet, and I laugh into my pillow, which is how teenagers tell the first truth of the day after lying successfully for hours. I get up and stand at the window because the moth ghost is fading and I need to remind myself how to make a ritual new. The cicadas are full orchestra now, tuning knives and harps and trash lids. I hum something beachy and then something I made up and neither of those songs is stronger than their electricity, but they don’t have to be. They only have to be mine.

Sunday is laundry and a walk and the kind of early evening that makes the sky look like someone burned sugar on top of a city. The machines at the laundromat on Britain spin like you could fall into them and come out right. Cal sits on the plastic chair next to me with his knee bouncing hard enough to power an appliance. He tells me about his mother’s new job at a salon two bus rides away and the way she texts him pictures of the hair she cuts like this is how she prays. He doesn’t say how long they were without rent when she got hurt last spring or how the landlord’s face looks when a day eats a day, and I don’t ask, because that’s a religion too.

When the clothes are folded into neat piles that we will knock over by Tuesday, we cut by the old motel on 183 I have not named out loud in a year. The carpet in the lobby is new and the door where my memory lives is painted a bright motel red that has nothing to do with the hallway in my head. We stand across the street and I let the building be a building with plumbing instead of a trap with whispers. Cal doesn’t say, Let’s go inside, because he is not a TV show. He says, “You good here?” and I nod and count the screws in the sign’s frame and take one breath and then two, and it is not a miracle, but it is a thing that would have been impossible last fall.

Back at Leland, a palmetto bug appears in the downstairs bathroom as if to remind me ladders are for houses on fire and not for days like this. It’s a big one, bronze and too shiny and it moves like a toy with fresh batteries and I have zero religious language that can make me okay. I freeze, because old body comes roaring on line with all its sirens, and the sound under my ribs is a hurricane trying to lift wooden houses. Cal hears me not scream from the hallway and arrives with a trash can and a piece of cardboard like a missionary who gets that you don’t want to join. “I won’t ask you to look,” he says, and he doesn’t. He scoops, he covers, he takes the parade out the back with a dignity that makes me furious and in love with the world, which is a violent combination.

Vic meets him at the back step with a shovel and a question and a nod that says, This is a house. This is how we do it. Dre hovers with his hands in his pockets pretending he had something to do with this save, and when the lid claps back down and the problem goes to whatever afterlife pest problems go to, nobody claps, because there are victories you don’t invite applause to. I breathe against the wall until the paint prints itself on my shoulder and I whisper, “Ladder, ladder, ladder,” like a person checking to see if the floor is still floor. It is. The house holds.

That night I tape a new tiny color picture into the notebook, smaller than a postage stamp, and practice the keyhole and the breath and the apology coffee in my head because there’s only so much liquid you should drink before bed. I write a sentence to AFK_Cicada in the comments that says: Bathroom today. Did not die. Friend did rescue. Feels like cheating. It feels like I am sending up a flare from a ship that is not sinking but wants company for the night. We go to sleep and the cicadas keep insisting like they do, and the hum under their hum is now usually my own. The horses in the canal do not move but I dream them moving anyway, and in the dream they slow down enough to let me put a hand on their warm, metal necks, and I wake with a heat in my palm that feels like the opposite of panic.

Monday morning I wake to the sound of rain that is not rain, because Texas has jokes. The cicadas have turned up the volume like their choir director got ambitious. I count five, then eight, then ten, because sometimes math is a sandbag against a flood. I meet Cal at the mailbox and he holds out the phone with the volume still a rumor and the clip still a blink, and we do our three, and the mailbox remains a mailbox. On the bus, the Batman boy declares he is no longer king of the ants because there was a coup and now he is president. His mother says, “Checks and balances,” without looking up, and I make a note to marry someone someday who can do that with a sentence.

At school, Coach steals me between first and second like joy kidnaps guilt when it is working correctly, and he sets up a drill where I dribble and say the alphabet and somewhere after D my brain forgets to look for wings. In biology, Ms. Lowry brings me a new block with a different beetle inside and says, “Meet Bernard,” like she named it and like naming is the same thing as kindness. At lunch, Dre does the hand-legs thing once and stops halfway like he bored himself and that’s the best sign I’ve seen all week. In English, Mrs. Dannel gives me back my origin essay with a note at the end in small, neat letters that says, Keep going. Voice loves practice. The underline under loves looks like she meant more than grammar and less than prophecy, and I put the paper in my bag like it’s legal tender.

We stop at the canal because sky, because horses, because the city forgets to be ugly when the light is right. Cal talks about a YouTube video he wants to make that is just hands doing useful things in slow motion, because he believes the internet should burn slowly sometimes. I tell him about the motel without saying motel, and he hears it, and he follows the river crack in my voice to the place where it turns and doesn’t make me go any farther. He says, “Tonight, no sound, just stills,” and I say, “No, we keep the thief on our lawn,” and he says, “Okay, but we don’t let him in the house,” and I say, “Okay,” and we both look at the way the bronze mouths don’t eat or speak and still manage to tell us to run and to stop in the same breath.

By the time the streetlights flicker on like late ideas and the air gives up pretending it’s not tired, the notebook has three new checkmarks that mean nothing and everything. The house smells like something Maribel burned on purpose to hide something else that she didn’t. Vic adds a receipt to his stack and the numbers look like a fence around worry. Dre sits on the arm of the couch with his feet on the cushion in a way that would get you murdered in other houses, and when Baxter puts his head in his lap he flinches like he’s remembering something that bit and then he lets the dog’s face stay, and I do not take a victory lap in my mind. I do not write it down. I just put it in the drawer with my extra shirts, a thing I might need later when the day does its tricks again.

When I go upstairs, I press my forehead to the glass where the moth ghost is fading into regular window and I think about how ghosts are just persistence someone noticed. The cicadas practice for the show they will play long after I leave this house, this street, this city. I hum, and I listen, and I choose a clip for the morning that is one beat longer and not a beat more, and I set the phone face-down on the dresser like a promise. Tomorrow I will pull the corner up and look and smell coffee and count to three and maybe to four. Tomorrow is not a metaphor yet. It is a breath I plan to take.Chapter 6

The phone waits on my dresser like a little black stone I put my will into last night. Before I touch it, I practice the square Vic taught me after hearing Coach say it—four in, four hold, four out, four wait—drawing an invisible window in the air and breathing through each side until my ribs stop acting like burglars. The cicadas have filed their morning paperwork with the trees and the sound has that bureaucratic hum, endless and relieved to be doing something. I smell the ghost of coffee and one of the little ones’ shampoo that insists on being apples, and I tell my brain we are still in the same house we were in while we slept. When I pull up the clip and press my finger to the triangle, the bug inside does its blink of a run, the sound is a whisper that doesn’t rise above the street, and I keep my eyes on the part of the screen that is sky. Three breaths happen where only one used to live, and then I thumb the phone face-down and tell myself to go downstairs and eat the less-burnt corner because beginners deserve prizes.

Cal is already leaning on the mailbox when I step into the heat that has decided to start early. He doesn’t ask whether, he asks how, which is a different kindness than most people think to offer. I give him a number and an eyebrow and he translates that into a fist bump light enough not to send any messages my nerves can misread. The bus wheezes up and kneels like a tired saint and we climb with the morning crew, a mix of faces that could be a city or a playing card hand depending on how you look. Batman boy has promoted himself to president of the ants and is explaining veto power to his mother, who says “separation of powers” in the tone of someone who knows where the soccer cleats are and also, somehow, the Federalist Papers. I envy their confidence in a system that could keep anyone where they belong. I sit in the very front again because floors still have agendas and I only have so many eyes.

In English, Mrs. Dannel asks for volunteers to read, and the pasta girl waves her hand so hard the air trips. She reads my paragraph about the horses and does it without a cartoon voice, which makes it feel less like my words are being taken for a walk and more like they got to sit in a chair in front of everybody and put their feet on the table without being told to get down. When she’s done, nobody claps because we’re seventeen and allergic to ceremony, but the quiet we give the paragraph is unwrinkled. I forget to chew my pen for a minute and realize later the mouth of it is mercifully intact. On the way out, Mrs. Dannel leans toward me just enough to say, “Keep the verbs chewy,” and it’s the oddest encouragement I’ve ever loved.

Biology smells like chalk and someone’s lotion that wanted to be a fruit and failed. Ms. Lowry has added another acrylic block to my station, a stag beetle with antlers like a small crown, and under it she’s propped an index card with a sentence: Ask for what you need even if it sounds like a joke. I tell her I need the terrariums to stay asleep and for someone who isn’t me to say my name once if anything starts to move too fast. She nods like these are reasonable requests in a world that often fails that test. A boy behind me mutters my name into his fist like he’s hidden a microphone there, and Ms. Lowry plants her hand on his desk and says his full name with the exact number of syllables that tell you someone loved you enough to warn you. We label anthers and filaments and ovaries and I pretend not to think about how the word ovary sounds like a room you could nap in if the door stayed shut.

At lunch under the crepe myrtle, Cal spreads three fries in his palm like tarot. He calls them Past, Present, Future and eats Present to show he knows timing. He holds the phone between us and the sound is a little fuller now, a thrum from two houses down, as if the world is practicing speaking a dialect I will eventually pick up. I manage my two and half breaths, then three, then, for a flicker, four, and when my stomach tries to run I tell it to sit and stay like Baxter when he’s being his best self. Dre walks by and looks like he might do the spider-fingers, but he doesn’t; his hands stay busy tossing a packet of salt up and down and his face finds something else to aim at. I don’t call it victory. I call it weather with a nicer breeze.

Coach nabs me between sixth and seventh like a fisherman with ethics, and we do a drill where I dribble with my left while naming breakfast cereals and the ridiculousness of saying “Frosted Wheat” aloud while trying not to lose the ball is enough to pry my brain’s fingers off every corner of the room. We run suicides that are named badly for people who have seen what real endings look like, and by the last line my lungs have opinions and my legs feel like furniture someone has moved to a new room without asking, but the part of my head that keeps a catalogue of wing angles is bored. Bored is where the ladder wants me. Coach says, “You look less like a kite today,” and I think about being a barometer instead and decide I prefer instruments with numbers more than strings with knots.

We get to the library late enough that the kids’ corner is a disaster of foam shapes and an abandoned picture book about a spider who is a detective and I put it back on the shelf with the spine facing out like a favor to the part of myself that still believes in organization. Ray stamps returns without looking up, the deliberate thunk of it a metronome you could use to measure any life, and I wonder what the inside of his head looks like when he gets home and nobody needs him to be tidy. In the computer corner, AFK_Cicada has written again, this time with a kind of kindness that has sand in it. They say: There will be a day when you are doing dishes and one of them walks across your religion. That day is not your fault. Let your friend be a mop if he volunteers. Raise a glass to the part of you that didn’t leave the room. Start again that night like it’s a Monday. They add: Some of us named the fear something too dumb to be king. Mine was Sir Clatters. One person uses The Committee. Another uses Mr. Six. Humor makes the amygdala hold its nose. I read it with my breath and Cal grins at Sir Clatters and under his breath tries three new names that almost make me snort in the quiet zone.

Dinner at Leland is a democracy of microwaves and attitudes. Maribel produces a bowl of beans and some tortillas and we build our own coherence out of them. Vic sets a new sticky note on the fridge that says Inspection Passed with a lopsided smiley, and he reads it aloud like none of us can, which is both insulting and the exact right move. Dre hovers by the door to the patio as if his feet cannot choose between this room and air, and when Baxter lumbers into his space and leans, Dre startles, then sets his palm flat on Baxter’s ribcage like a man learning the shape of a word. He looks at me to see whether I saw him be human and I do the nice thing and look at the salt shaker instead.

When the sun falls into the street like someone dropped a pot of warm gold, the sky turns that particular bruised peach that makes you believe in more expensive cities. The power flickers the way Texas likes to, as if the grid is a boy in gym class who forgot to eat breakfast, and then it goes and stays gone. The air immediately feels like a coat you can’t shrug off. Vic swears with the elegance of a youth pastor who left the church and tells Maribel to light the good candles, which smell like cinnamon and not like the soap we can afford. The little kids cheer because darkness is a game until it isn’t. Dre says “cool” and means “I’m bored,” and I stand very still because moving is how my eyes make mistakes.

The moths come like gossip to a porch party. Wings print themselves against the screens and the air fills with gentle collisions, all those small bodies testing the edge between in and out. Someone squeals in the bathroom—one of the little ones, probably, though fear is a democracy here and you never know—and Vic heads that way with a towel and a voice that can make light out of letters. Cal appears with a headlamp I didn’t know he owned and makes himself ridiculous enough that the room tips toward laughter. He hums that Beach Boys thing because thunder isn’t singing tonight but old habits can be repurposed. I breathe through my mouth because the smell of too many wings has a chalk to it, and I press my palm to the notebook’s plastic sleeve because prophecy needs props.

There’s a palmetto on the far wall, cinematic in its confidence. It moves with batteries and I can feel my whole family history of reactions rising, each ancestor under my skin shouting and pointing toward a door. Cal says my name once like it’s a handle I can reach for. He gets the cup and the postcard as if we’re a team on a TV show that has to solve a problem under ten seconds. He coaxes, he scoops, he flips, and the insect becomes a thing in a dome and then a thing taken out the back, and my job becomes standing here with the cinnamon candle in my hands and smelling survival. Dre steps into my peripheral and doesn’t make a sound effect, and when Cal returns with the cup empty he gives Dre the postcard to throw away like an assignment that will make him feel less like a porch. Dre takes it, shrugs, and drops it in the trash with a face that would be cooler if he weren’t twelve inside. I whisper thank yous like a leaking faucet—to Cal, to the stupid candle, to my heart for not quitting, to Sir Clatters for leaving the room when asked politely.

The power coughs back on with a groan, and the kitchen gasps like someone put a bag over its head and then changed their mind. The air conditioner stutters and then sighs and the lamps blink and the television tries to sell us something loud before Maribel kills it with the authority of an aunt. Vic does a circuit of the house like a night watchman from a novel with a lantern that’s a phone. The little kids settle their bodies into corners the way cats do when they’ve had enough theater. I clean candle wax from the table with my thumbnail and decide that when the internet tells me to pair hard with soft, it wasn’t just being Pinterest. Cinnamon bites the chemical gleam right in the eye.

By the time the house remembers itself and tucks its stomach back in, the notebook has a new entry that reads: Power out. Moths like soft coins. Sir Clatters visited, escorted out. Stood still. Smelled cinnamon. Didn’t leave my body. I draw a box and put a check in it that looks like a person who learned their mark on their first day of school. Cal draws a smaller box next to it and puts a dot inside, which is his way of saying stop here, don’t ruin it by bragging, breathe, be done.

Sunday turns into Monday without asking, and the morning walks in like it pays the bills. The phone clip stretches one more beat and my throat stretches with it and the edges of the world don’t shred. On the bus, Batman boy has demoted himself to mayor because presidents carry too much paperwork, and his mother says, “Term limits,” with her mouth in a smile she forgot to let out. The billboard has changed again to a college that wants my money and promises to turn me into a person who knows how to make slideshows in buildings of glass. I already know how to make slideshows. Mine just turn the other way.

On the way to third period, a flyer is stapled crooked on the corkboard: Perot Museum trip, Biology Club, End of Month. My lunch launches itself into my throat and perches there looking down. The picture on the flyer is a blue butterfly that looks incapable of harm and I’m not fooled. Ms. Lowry catches me pausing and says, “We’re not going if the world is on fire,” which is her way of giving me an out without making me take it. I tell her, not yet, which is the truest thing I can do, and she nods like that’s a kind of permission I afforded myself.

After school, Coach leans against the wall by the gym with the posture of a man who knows he owns a thousand repetitions of the same sentence and somehow still believes each one deserves a new breath. He hands me the ball like a gift and we do his box-breath while I shoot from the elbow and try to let my wrists do what they learned in a different world. He says, “Set your feet like you’re willing to stay,” and I do, and I hit one and miss two and hit one and I don’t apologize to the air. Cal watches from the doorway and claps once like we’re at a symphony and we agreed before we came not to be the weirdos.

The library is cool as always, and Ray has put out a display of field guides, birds and rocks and a stack of Texas Insects illustrated like they were all sitting for portraits. I touch the spine of that one and then touch a different one, because sometimes choosing your cowardice is also a kind of control. AFK_Cicada has written a long post about associative smells and how their mother wore a cheap perfume that came in a bottle shaped like a blue wave and how when they unscrew cinnamon they can still smell that wave behind it if they try, and I wonder what my mother would smell like if memory were kinder. Maybe cigarettes and hairspray, which means my fear has always been a 7-Eleven aisle and it’s a miracle I survived aisle four.

At dinner, Vic gives us each a chore like Oprah gives out cars. Mine is to dust the tops of doorframes, which turn out to be the lost continents of our house, a geography of fuzz and a dead mosquito and one old sticker of a star. Dre “forgets” to wipe the baseboards until Vic says, “Ten corners, remember?” and Dre gives him a look that says he is keeping track of how many times he has to share the same house with other people. Baxter shadows me and sneezes when I raise the duster and I tell him, very seriously, “Bless you,” because we’re trying to be a polite monarchy here.

We try one longer clip after dinner with the smell of cinnamon and the noise of spoons on bowls and the soundtrack of the house doing its thousand small chores to stay upright. The insect on the screen runs for a full second and my chest tries to be a jack-in-the-box and then remembers it doesn’t have to, and across the room Dre pretends to not be watching by staring exactly at us. When we put the phone face-down, he says, “So you make it say uncle?” and I say, “No, I make it a plant,” and he frowns because metaphor is not his sport. Later, when the little ones are brushing their teeth with the volume of a parade, he drifts near Baxter again and holds still long enough for a lick to happen, and when he flinches he forces his shoulders down into a position that looks like surrender and bravery at once. I do not applaud. I do not even look. I add two dots next to the check in the book that mean we’ll remember this on a day we need extra.

That night, the cicadas’ song feels less like attack and more like the city knitting something I won’t own until winter. Cal texts me a picture of a page from the field guide with a drawing of a dragonfly that looks like a blueprint for a helicopter with a better soul. He writes, Ted, and I write, Sir Clatters has a cousin, and we take turns writing names dumb enough to make my amygdala hold its nose. I press my forehead to the fading moth place on the glass and the room meets me with the quiet only a thin pane can keep. I make a plan to stand in the museum lobby and count the screws in the rail and smell cinnamon in my sleeve if we go. I make a plan to say not this time if we don’t. I make a plan to wake up again, and when I do, I will pull up the corner of the next picture and look through the keyhole and say the name we gave it until it becomes a word in a language I am building with the boy who insists in the next room.Chapter 7

The morning sits on my chest like a warm book, not heavy enough to crush, just insistent enough to make breathing a choice. I stare at the phone where I left it, that small dark square full of arguments I intend to win by inches. The square breath Coach taught me—four in, four hold, four out, four wait—draws a ghost window I can put my face against without leaving the room. The house hums its opening chord. Vic rattles a spoon against a mug like a metronome that lost its job and found religion. Baxter yawns in a key only dogs own. The cicadas lift their hymn out of the pecans as if last night’s song needed an encore and none of us had the heart to tell them we were trying to sleep. I smell the brown sugar of the cinnamon candle residue and the old coffee in the pot, and I tell my brain: same house, same dumb shampoo, same unmade bed. I press play. The bug inside the phone makes its tight little dash and the sound is a throat two rooms away asking for water. I look at the corner of the screen where sky lives, count three slow coins, and end the clip before the part of me that collects emergency exits starts speaking Latin.

Cal is at the mailbox wearing the expression of a boy who is both a door and a polite bouncer. He doesn’t say, You do it? He says, What number, and when I show him with my fingers, he nods as if we are making shadow puppets that mean we might survive. He tucks the phone in his back pocket, a small animal trusting his spine, and we take the bus like it’s a ship we both believe in enough to ignore the leaks. Batman boy has now demoted himself to alderman of the ants because the mayor has to attend too many ribbon cuttings, and his mother, who could teach a civics class in a grocery line, murmurs “filibuster” as if reminding herself to breathe at meetings. The billboard has turned itself into a colon cleanse disguised as a waterfall and I would like to vote out metaphors for a week so I can hear my own.

English gives us peer edits with three highlighters like traffic lights—green for go, yellow for hm, red for maybe don’t—and the class clown draws noodles around the margins of the paragraph where I wrote about the mustangs in the canal, and underlines one sentence and writes, “Chef’s kiss,” which is flattery in a dialect I didn’t know I needed. Mrs. Dannel reads a line aloud that is mine without saying whose, and the room does that teenage holy quiet where no one wants to be caught moving. In the margin of my paper, where my handwriting loops like a person trying to remember how cursive felt in second grade, she writes, “Keep the spine in your sentences,” which is a mixed metaphor I can live inside for the rest of the day.

Biology is a weather report and a lab. Ms. Lowry has added a third acrylic block to my station, a jeweled scarab with a green that could teach the leaves a thing or two, and she has also put a crisp permission form on every desk with the Perot Museum logo at the top next to a butterfly whose blue is a lie. The terrariums sleep under towels tagged Rest in handwriting that looks like she learned to print from a gentle nun. I do not look at the corners of that towel. I look at the stag beetle’s horns inside his amber jail and let my finger map the rectangle’s warm edge. “Friday if your people sign,” Ms. Lowry says to the room, and then to me, lower but not softer, “Or not Friday if the universe is stupid. I am as flexible as a gym mat, minus the sweat.” A boy at the next table makes a little tic of a clicking noise with his tongue the way Dre does when he’s bored and hungry for blood, and she says his full name like a verdict and he stops because names are handbrakes. We label parts of a flower I could name in my sleep now and I think about how you can know the anatomy of a petal and still be surprised by what brushes your cheek when you walk through a field.

The crepe myrtle crowns us again at lunch, confetti in my hair making me look like a party I did not plan. Cal has three fries and pretends they are tarot again and eats Past this time because he says you never trust nostalgia. He pulls the phone, and the clip is one beat longer because we decided last night to greet the thief on our lawn again. The sound sits in the throat of the device like a radio three apartments down and the movement is still a rumor. I count, I breathe, I keep one finger pressed to the paper in the notebook like I’m pinning my name to the day. Dre slides into the frame of my life without announcement, hands busy flipping a packet of pepper instead of making legs-out-of-fingers, and I don’t trust it yet, but I don’t call it danger either. “Ladder,” he mutters, and keeps walking like that’s his joke to himself and I am not allowed to laugh.

Coach nabs me after sixth and insists I say cereal names while dribbling with my left again because he believes in making the part of my brain that loves chaos work double shifts. The ball kisses the floor; my breath kisses my ribs. “Set your feet like you actually live here,” he says, and when I do, my shoulders forget to audition for the role of bat wings. He throws me a pass that arrives like a question that isn’t urgent and I answer with a bank shot uglier than a cartoon and as true. “Barometer,” he says, and then, because he’s noticed me copying his metaphors, “Okay, fine, wind sock. Just don’t be a kite.” The gym lights do that buzz I used to think was an omen and now catalog as electricity with opinions.

At the library, the field guides Ray put out have multiplied as if he found a stash under his desk and decided to show us what it’s like to live in a state that thinks the world can be listed. There’s Texas Birds and Rocks of North America and a row of Texas Insects whose spines stare at me like teeth with good orthodontia. I brush the edge of one with the back of my hand, an accidentally tender move, and choose a book about stars instead because sometimes you have to misdirect your own magician. In the computer corner, AFK_Cicada has posted again, a paragraph that reads like a map someone drew from memory on a napkin. They write: In vivo doesn’t have to mean brave. It can mean PetSmart on a Tuesday at two. It can mean the reptile aisle where the crickets sing behind perforated lids. It can mean the shelf where mealworms are asleep in oatmeal. Pair your sound with your smell—coffee, gum—and a rule: You are allowed to leave after one breath. Try cicada shells. They are old houses that forgot their tenants. Texas is lousy with them in August. Touch one with a finger like it’s a doorbell. You get to be the neighbor. Cal reads it and looks at me as if he’s just found us a path through a backyard that will keep us off the street.

We stop at the 7-Eleven for coffee like sinners visiting a saint, one large cup between us because the budget is a god with rules. The smell acts like a rope tied to the porch. I press the cardboard sleeve to my nose like a joke I tell myself when nobody else is watching. The PetSmart off MacArthur is colder than most churches and emptier at two, and the lady at the register looks at us with the heavy-lidded forgiveness of someone who has measured out fish food for six hours. The reptile aisle makes my heart write a resignation letter and then tear it up. The cricket tubs are clear and stacked and the chorus is a machine of summer in a plastic choir loft. There’s a sign that says DO NOT TAP and I can’t imagine who would want to touch that window of sound except a person built differently from me and everyone I have ever loved. Cal stands a step ahead and a half to the right, creating a shoulder-width of possible retreat. “One breath,” he says, and holds the coffee where I can steal it if I need to.

I look at the tubs and then at the shelf, at the price tags and the tiny perforations like intentional constellations. The movement is an argument behind plastic, a windstorm of wings and legs that haven’t decided whether they want to be the same thing. The smell of coffee is stubborn in my nose and the clangor of chirps somehow wears a sweater around it. One breath happens. The first breath on purpose is like putting your hand into a river you thought was poison and feeling only water and the memory of cold. The second breath has opinions and I ignore them. A boy in a lizard T-shirt that says FEED ME walks around us with a live plant in a pot that will sustain someone’s snake, and he nods without judgment, which gives me one more inch of what passes for courage. I look at the mealworms asleep in their oatmeal like a bad metaphor and then at the tub where they are awake and moving like spokes in a wheel. For one second I imagine my skin is a wall of the tub, and then I replace the thought with coffee and Cal’s shoulder and the sign that says DO NOT TAP because somebody put up a rule just for me and I am going to obey it like a citizen.

We buy nothing. We leave like champions who won a medal in a sport nobody can spectate. Outside, the heat slaps the PetSmart air off us and I taste plastic and cinnamon and relief. Cal turns left without asking because he knows I like to make this into a loop that runs past the canal. The mustangs hold their forever pose, the water chews at their hooves with affectionate teeth, and the bronze looks like it could be hot enough to brand your name into you if you leaned too hard. We lean against the railing like boys in a music video who haven’t earned the background music. “What’s a cicada shell even look like?” I ask, and Cal makes a shape with his hands like a small torso with elbows. “Like a suit left on a chair after a party,” he says. “Like the ghost of a robot.” We decide to look later, in the yard where the pecans can hear us admit we need the proof.

At home, Leland is a live-action sitcom that never got syndicated. The little ones have turned a blanket and two chairs into a clinic for stuffed animals, and there is a bear getting his stuffing checked for rabies with a spoon. Maribel presides with a clipboard that proves you can pretend paperwork into existence. Vic is at the table with two piles of receipts and three distinct sighs. Dre walks through the living room wearing headphones as if that makes him invisible, and his eyes find the traps and then me and then the ceiling in quick succession like a person checking exits. “Help me with the front stoop,” Vic says to the room at large and to Dre in particular, and Dre invents a cough and then sighs and comes anyway because pretending not to care is tiring when people can do math in front of you.

On the steps, pecan leaves stick to our shoes the way small hours stick to bad decisions. There’s a cicada shell on the slat near the post, a crisp little echo of a body with its back unzipped, clasped to the wood like it still believes in the height it found. I point without pointing. “There,” I say, which is a big word. Cal crouches and says, “Neighbor,” softly, and the shell hears him not at all because it is a house where no one lives. Dre squints at it like it owes him money and then looks at me to see which way I will jump. I kneel because kneeling is a gesture even my heart understands. My hand hovers and then doesn’t. My finger touches the belly—the part that clung—and the shell is lighter than a sentence and brittle enough to be prayer. I expect movement because the old mind likes to prank, and when the only movement is my own breath, something in my chest stands down like a soldier who got the wrong orders.

“Gross,” Dre says, but it sounds like he’s impressing himself, not me, and when I lift the shell, I do it with the same care Cal gives to the phone. In my palm it looks like a suit you could never fit into again. There’s a split up the back where the body climbed out of itself into air, and the idea that somebody left because they got too big for their skin is the kind of moral I can get behind without resenting the teacher. “Keep it?” Cal asks, because he knows talismans are not a joke unless they’re yours, and I nod because my hand already decided.

We sit on the steps and Vic pretends not to watch us have a moment because he is good at letting kids make rituals without supervision. Dre scuffs the toe of his too-white shoe against the porch, which is a method of aging them I respect. “My grandma’s place had them,” he says to the porch, to the cicada shell, to whoever. “Roaches. Everywhere. They’d come up from under the sink like they had a lease. I used to sleep with socks on my hands.” He laughs at himself because he thinks the only way to say that sentence without caving in is to slap a joke on the end, and I sit still and let the air be brave for both of us. “I hate them,” he adds, and the hate sounds like a birth certificate.

“I know,” I say, and the porch says it too because sometimes wood remembers people leaning on it with the same sadness. “I hate them too. That doesn’t make me your toy.” The words surprise me because I thought you had to pick one: be kind or be alive. Dre doesn’t flare or ignite. He chews his cheek, which is where he stores his arguments, and then shrugs like a pop quiz whose answer he has chosen not to memorize. “Whatever,” he says, which is teen for, I heard you with some parts of my body, and he wanders to the hose to run it for no reason and I don’t shout about water because the sound is useful when you are building ladders.

Inside, I tape the cicada shell into the notebook with a loop of Scotch at the feet and a prayer at the back. The tape is a bad idea because the shell is lighter than a sigh, and it sticks enough to hold but not enough to keep for years. Maybe that’s right. Maybe talismans shouldn’t last forever or you mistake them for the thing that saved you. I write: Neighbor. Pecan. Suit with a zipper. Touched it. Breath returned. Under that I copy something from the thread: old houses that forgot their tenants. Cal sticks a tiny square of cinnamon gum wrapper to the page, shiny and dumb and perfect, and draws a box to fill because he knows I am the kind of person who will not sleep if I don’t mark things as done.

Dinner is slow tacos with beans and the kind of conversation that happens when everyone is looking at a different thing and still listens. Maribel asks if we have clean socks like a joke that doubles as a threat. Vic says the inspector wrote “commendable” next to emergencies and he says the word like a little trophy he feels silly about loving. Coach texts Cal a grainy miniature of a court with nobody on it, which is how he says, Open gym if your lungs feel like it, and Cal texts back a thumbs with a muscle arm which is as masculine as we get in our house. Dre sits at the edge of the couch with his feet on the cushion like he will never know there is a correct way to be in a living room and maybe that’s okay if you clean the cushion after.

We try one full-second clip after dinner because I am drunk on cicada and coffee and stupid courage. The phone hums its insect rumor and the bug runs its line like it knows marks on a stage. The sound is bigger but still a rumor. I pinch the corner of the screen with my fingers to make a keyhole and say, out loud, “Kitchen. Beans. Cinnamon. Suit with zipper,” and Cal says, softly, “Neighbor,” like a new word will keep scuttling in its lane. At the end of the second we flip the phone over like you would a friendly turtle who is determined to walk into a street. Across the room Dre looks down at Baxter with a gaze that is almost affectionate, and when Baxter thumps his tail against the table leg and knocks a grocery circular to the floor, Dre bends and picks it up and my heart claps once in its seat.

Night coats the house the way syrup coats pancakes on a good morning. The cicadas strap their amp to the tree and lean into the solo. I take the notebook to the window because the moth’s ghost is fading and I am stubborn about where I make offerings. The shell on the page looks like a little god I don’t mind believing in, the kind you could brush off a sleeve. Cal texts a picture of a neon sign outside the laundromat on Britain that reads OPEN like a threat, and under it he types, Tomorrow we ask Ms. Lowry about the museum. I write back, Tomorrow I say not yet even if she says now, and he writes, You say what you want, and I write, I want to stand in a lobby. We build the day out of sentences until it looks like something I can carry.

In the morning, Irving smells like a toaster and a gas station at the same time, which I have decided is the scent of hope. The phone’s clip grows one more beat like a child who keeps asking for five more minutes before bed, and my breath grows with it, and the part of me that used to patrol like a guard dog on speed sits and puts its head on my knee. Cal leans against the mailbox in our usual place and looks at my face for numbers and nods when I show him three like we’re flashing gang signs for a club that only admits cowards who keep going. The bus kneels and Batman boy is now comptroller of the ants, a position he can explain for four stops, and his mother says “appropriations” and I love her so much for giving language to a tiny despot that I want to stand up and clap.

At school, the day tries ten new ways to be ordinary. Mrs. Dannel asks us to write a letter to our future selves and I start with Dear me, which is stupid and correct, and I tell him about ladders and coffee and a boy who insisted, and I ask him if the horses still run without moving, and I fold the page in half so it can rest. In the hall, Ms. Lowry corners me with a permission slip in her hand like a story she’s not trying to make me read. “Lobby,” she says, as if the word is a password, and I say, “If,” and she says, “Only if,” and we both grin like thieves. Dre does the hand-legs thing once at someone else and watches me not react with a face that says his project has lost funding. At lunch under the crepe myrtle I hold the cicada shell in my palm while we play the clip, and the outside body in my hand convinces the inside body in my chest that leaving yourself is an option you don’t have to take.

We hit PetSmart again after school because repetition is romance to the part of the mind that hates surprise. The crickets sing. The mealworms practice their slow arithmetic. A kid with a leopard gecko on his shoulder like a badge asks if he can pet Baxter, and I tell him Baxter doesn’t work here, which he takes as yes. When we leave, we stop by the canal and Cal dares me to put the cicada shell on the bronze of one horse’s foreleg like a joke for a god, and I do, and the shell holds on for the length of a breath and then falls onto the concrete and breaks into two clean halves. I feel the pang and then the relief, because sometimes you need the proof that what you carried was never the thing itself. Cal looks at my face like he’s asking for permission to laugh and I give it to him and we snort like kids until tourists look at us like we are a noise they didn’t pay for.

Back at Leland, the living room smells like pasta because someone threw noodles at a pot and the pot threw back. Maribel shakes a colander like maracas and declares dinner a fiesta and we all pretend it is because her voice will not tolerate doubt. Vic scrolls the weather and mutters about heat advisories like they are personal, and then he looks up and his eyes go to my hand like he can see the place where the shell wore a groove and he says nothing because adults who deserve medals sometimes believe in your privacy. Dre drifts to the back door and stands with his hand on the jamb like he is practicing staying. “I’ve got socks on my hands,” he mumbles, a small confession no one asked for, and I nod like that can be our handshake. He doesn’t ask to see the notebook and I don’t offer. We eat our noodles, which are not pasta in any Italian’s book but manage to make us laugh anyway, and in the noise I locate my breath and put it where it belongs.

In bed, I don’t press my forehead to the glass because the ghost is gone and I don’t want to chase old rituals into corners. I stare at the ceiling crack that looks like a river and imagine a boat with our names painted badly on its side. The cicadas race themselves into a froth and up the block someone honks twice like a greeting and not a warning. I take the paper form for the museum out of my bag and write my name in a blocky hand that doesn’t look like an adult’s yet, and I slide it under the notebook like a bookmark in a book I am not sure I will keep reading. Cal texts a picture of a tiny museum map he found online with a circle around the lobby and he writes, We don’t go unless you say. I write, I might want to see the ceiling. He writes, Ceilings are safe animals. I write, Good, and the word sits in my mouth like a pearl I didn’t expect and I fall asleep with it there, small and hard and mine.Chapter 9

The morning elbows me awake before the sun gets polite. The cicadas are already filing their work reports outside the pecans, and the house answers with its own paperwork—Vic’s spoon against a mug, the toaster’s cough, Baxter’s nails writing his name on the stairs. The phone on my dresser is a dark coin I keep paying to the day. I do the box breath again, the ghost window with four sides, and the air moves through me like a patient, like a trainee that is beginning to understand its job. Three beats on the clip now, then a fourth I only owe if my heart isn’t trying to convince my ribs to sprint laps. I press play, watch the little body flash from left to right, listen to the whisper I can pretend is a neighbor’s radio, and stop it before my mind starts unpacking emergency flares. Coffee lives in my nose from the pot downstairs even before I drink it. Cinnamon still haunts the kitchen like a good rumor.

Cal is at the mailbox as if the city issued him the job. He raises his eyebrows in a number and I tap my fingers back—three, crooked, then the shape of a maybe. He grins with half of his face because the other half is busy being an older brother to my terrified organs. We don’t talk much until the bus. Talking fits better on wheels. Batman boy has run out of titles and declares himself citizen of the ants today, which for once sounds like a democracy I recognize. His mother says “constituency” like she’s teaching a TED Talk in a Target line. The billboard on 183 advertises a festival somewhere green where white tents bloom like teeth, and the font says joy while the heat says bring your own oxygen.

English is a color-coded argument. We throw highlighters at each other’s drafts—green for yes, yellow for maybe, red for don’t, child—and pasta girl circles my sentence about the canal's horses and writes “marry me” next to it, which is criticism with its own absurd grammar. Mrs. Dannel reads parts out loud again without naming the mouths they came from and the room holds still like it forgot how to rustle. She writes on the board, “Verbs are bones,” and underlines it twice, as if one day a bone will have to hold a boy up.

Biology is a stack of permission slips glossy as a swimming pool and a word written on the whiteboard in Ms. Lowry’s careful print: IF. Under it: ONLY IF. Somebody has done smiley faces in the Os because we deserve that level of theology today. The terrariums are asleep under their hospital blankets. On my station she’s left a beetle in acrylic and a sticky note: Lobby counts. A museum is a building full of doors. Choose yours. I hold the block in my palm and it is warm enough to pass for alive without bothering to threaten me. The boy behind me does the click in his mouth like his tongue is a remote control, and Ms. Lowry says his first name and his middle like she has a copy of his birth certificate and he glasses back into his seat.

At lunch, the crepe myrtle snows pink like someone tore up a good letter. Cal breaks a fry into three parts and names them Past, Present, Rent. He pops Rent into his mouth, because bills get paid or they end you. The sound on the phone is a hair louder. I press the napkin with cinnamon dust (we smuggled it out of the house under the sanctity of gum wrappers) to my face like a saint I invented. I breathe. Someone’s laugh from across the courtyard tries to insert itself in the video and fails. Dre walks by without spider-fingers and flicks his eyes toward us and away again, his mouth folded into an approximate line that says he has a planet inside him after all. He taps the corner of the notebook as he passes like he’s testing paint. “Friday,” he says, which is either a threat or a hope. I flip the page to the permission slip and decide it will be my word of the day anyway.

Coach’s hallway ambush after sixth period is less a kidnapping and more a rescue he disguises out of courtesy. He makes me say cereal names while dribbling with my left again, and halfway through “Cocoa Puffs” my hands forget to be archaeologists looking for ancient legs in the grout of the gym floor. “Set your feet like you actually pay rent,” he says. “Stop visiting your body. Live in the apartment.” I shoot from the elbow, ugly and true. He rebounds like he’s tired of the ball being wrong and happy to show it a better vocation. “That’s it,” he says. “Stop asking the room permission to exist in it.” It lands somewhere my ears didn’t know had chairs.

We go to the library because religion needs its rituals. Ray has built a display of field guides like stairs up to sanity: Rocks, Birds, Stars, Texas Insects. The last stares at me with the kind of polite confidence I have always resented. I touch the edge with the back of my knuckle and let it be brave for me without opening it. In the computer corner, AFK_Cicada has posted a list that feels like a permission slip with more verbs. It says: Museums are loud but predictable. Find ceilings you can trust. Make the lobby your first habitat. Choose a far wall in Gems as your second. Insects behind glass are photographs you can walk around. Level with yourself. You can leave every room as many times as you want. You can ask for a map and only use the key. Pair your smell. Borrow a stranger’s calm. Find a bench. Look up. It adds: The elevators vibrate. Breathe in squares. My ribs unclench like a fist that remembers its promise.

At home, Leland House is gathering itself the way teams gather without playbooks. Vic lines up paper bags full of generic snacks for the museum kids and writes names on them in a cursive that makes it look like we are going to church. He writes my name with half the letters filled in, efficient and affectionate, like a man saving ink for a good sentence later. Maribel volunteers a roll of peppermints because her mother swore by mint for sick stomachs and grief, and sometimes the same cure applies. Dre hovers by the porch and pretends not to notice when I tuck the cinnamon gum into my pocket like a weapon and Cal tucks the phone like a baby into his back pocket. Baxter noses each bag like customs and sits on mine for exactly three seconds, conferring blessing.

That night, I make the museum kit like I’m packing for a small war. Notebook, pen that doesn’t chew well because I will try. Gum. A packet of instant coffee I’ve never seen outside of a hotel, liberated from a box under the sink—Maribel’s doing, I suspect. The permission slip signed with Vic’s name in block letters because he knows forms get taken more seriously when they look like children. A coin I turn over in my palm because luck likes tools. Cal texts a blurry photo of the Perot lobby—white and glass and dinosaur bones branching upward like a cathedral for people who prefer their saints extinct. He writes, We stand under that and call it the roof of our day. I type, Lobby counts, and he sends three boxes drawn in pen on his wrist, four sides, the ghost window on skin.

The bus to Dallas smells like school baked in vinyl. Ms. Lowry takes attendance with a voice that refuses to apologize for inventing this day. Cal sits across the aisle because teachers invented rules for a reason and we don’t need to break those to impress each other. He raises his eyebrow into a question every time we hit a pothole and I answer with a breath like a postcard. Dre sits two rows back and stares out the window as if Dallas owes him money and he plans to collect on sight. The skyline arrives like a joke the city is tired of telling. The Perot’s toothy geometry cuts sky into biteable wedges. We are a file of teenagers and two adults with good intentions and a bag of peppermints.

The lobby is a white that believes in itself. The air smells like dino bones and rich people’s water. Children bloom in groups like matching flowers—neon shirts, white socks, confusion. The dinosaur skeleton in the middle is a long-necked question arcing up and out, ribcage like a ship’s hull, vertebrae like a zipper God forgot to hide. We stand under it and my neck acts like it’s been waiting for this job. I look up until looking up is all I know how to do. The ceiling is a grid made holy by light. Ms. Lowry moves us to one side, to a bench against a wall that pretends to be limestone. “Game plan,” she says to the clump of us that knows we were dragged or signed up terrified. “Lobby. Gems. If you want to try Bio Lab, I will go with you. If you want to name five screws in the railing and leave, that is data we can love.” She looks at me last, an instructor taking her hand off a bike seat without telling the kid.

I open the notebook and write, in letters I can read if my eyes start lying, LOBBY/CEILING. SMELL: GUM. ANCHOR: BONES. Cal leans in as much as he’s allowed and murmurs, “Boxes,” and I huff a laugh that doesn’t shatter. Kids from another school stampede past in t-shirts that say Tigers like we’re in a zoo that forgot cages. Dre stands near the T. rex skull like he is measuring his face against old teeth. He sees me counting screws on the rail and lifts his chin like that, he could do that in his sleep. Ms. Lowry doles out maps as if they’re talismans. The map has pictures of exhibitions I do not have to enter. This, I remind my chest, is not a rescue mission. It is a visit.

Gems and Minerals is the room you go to if you want the earth to brag. It is cool and dim and bejeweled and the cases glow like aquariums full of solid fish. The rocks sit still, which is a quality I intend to appreciate for the rest of my life. Ms. Lowry leans toward me just enough to push an edge of confidence into my space. “We start and leave,” she says. “We make speed bumps out of benches.” Cal ghosts my right shoulder, not touching, and his presence finds the little muscle behind my jaw that has been clamped since Tuesday and convinces it to move. We look at a chunk of something green and arrogant and a cluster of something purple that insists on geode and I breathe the gum into my head like it knows more than I do. I pick a bench. We sit for the time it takes to pretend to read the placard and I leave before my imagination starts auditioning for a spider.

We do the circuit again, lobby to gems and back, and I count it as a circuit because calling it a loop feels like failure. Ms. Lowry checks names against faces in her head. Cal scribbles boxes on the back of his map like he’s an architect inventing new air. Dre floats ahead of his satellites and pauses at a case full of fossils that look like pressed leaves, which is close to an apology for what I used to think. He doesn’t say my name. He doesn’t grin. He keeps both hands in sight.

“Bio Lab?” Ms. Lowry asks the group not with a dare but a shrug she pasted onto her voice. “It’s the floor above. There are pinned specimens behind glass. There might be jars. There might be a tarantula under a towel. There will not be a pop quiz.” The group splits the way groups split. Some hurl themselves toward the stairs like they are the hunger. Some pretend to be too cool and follow anyway. I feel the elevator in my bones and decide to trust the stairs, which have more honesty in them because you can see each next thing.

The hallway outside Bio Lab smells like cleaners and the inside of a refrigerator you cleaned last week and forgot to put food back in. The cases line the walls, glass fronted, each a little mausoleum of pinned beauty. Beetles the size of my fingernail sit forever next to ones the size of my fear, all iridescence and armor, labeled in a font that looks like a teacher’s handwriting learned to wear a lab coat. I stand at the far end so the fact of the line of them becomes a sentence instead of a slap. Cal stands like a post, like a casual fence I can lean my back on without turning. Ms. Lowry places one hand on the glass—flat, not dramatic—like she’s modeling how to be near without asking for anything back. “Photographs you can walk around,” she says, which is sanctimonious in the kind of way I need.

I do the keyhole thing with my fingers, even though it is glass and not my phone. I let a corner through. The green of a scarab is so stupidly beautiful that for a second I feel betrayed by my own brain for not noticing sooner. The leg is a stitch, the antennae a sentence I am not ready to read. I pull my eyes back to the metal edge of the case and trace it. Breath in four, hold four, out four, wait four. The stupid gum is a saint in my mouth. Behind me a kid says, “Gross,” and his friend says, “Cool,” and I think both are right and neither is the only truth I want to carry away.

Down the case a little, there’s a pinned dragonfly, wings like cathedral windows, a body labeled with a Latin that sounds like a spell. Ted, I think without deciding to. “Hey,” I tell Cal under my breath, and tilt my chin at it the way a person points with their soul. He sees the wings through the keyhole of my fingers and makes a low noise like a guitar string tuned to summer. I let my eyes slide to a note card that says “Madagascar hissing cockroach—live demo at 2 p.m.” and my laugh is a dry thing. I underline in the notebook, not today.

Somebody in our group—Flaco from geometry, the one who always takes an extra handout because he likes paper—edges nearer to me than the others and doesn’t look at my face. “My sister had a bug book,” he says, staring at the glass. “We had them in jars. Like, you poke holes and watch them forget the holes. She wasn’t afraid of anything. She leaves the TV on now like a nightlight.” He shrugs. “I don’t know how to help a person like that.” I nod and say, “You stand near the door,” and he nods back, the slow yes of a person not sure whether we just had a conversation or a trade.

We do one more bench in Gems as a palette cleanser. We do the lobby again because the lobby is home base and also because the long-necked dinosaur looks amused by our devotion and I want to keep it entertained so it will keep blessing my circulation. On the way past the gift shop, the window displays a plush tarantula with glass eyes too large for sense and a book that says Bugs A–Z in a font that makes children think danger can be alphabetized. The plush makes my shoulders want to borrow my ears and hide there. Dre pauses without being theatrical and looks through the glass like it owes him nothing, and then he looks at me deliberately and lifts both hands, palms up, empty, a mime of leaving something alone.

On the bus back, the vinyl eats the noises we collected and burps them up in small amounts so nobody chokes. Ms. Lowry sits up front reading something on her phone and making a face like the world is either passing a bill or asking to be set down and scolded. Cal sits with his knee bouncing because he can’t warehouse that much energy for long. He tips his head to the window so his reflection looks like a boy I know in a different city. He texts me a dinosaur emoji followed by a coffee cup like a sentence only we are qualified to grade. I type, Lobby counts, and he types back, Whole day counts, and then sends a box drawn with his finger on the glass and it trails across his reflection until it hits the bus door.

At home, the house breathes in stories the way the porch breathes in heat. Maribel asks, “Museo?” in a voice that pretends Spanish is an improvement on the day’s grammar. I say, “Lobby,” and she nods like a woman who has made dinners for years and knows that feeding anyone is half ingredients and half insisting. Vic asks only, “Did you look up?” and when I say yes, he hands me a plum too ripe for our budget like it’s a medal shaped like summer. Dre is bent over the coffee table drawing an elaborate crown in the corner of a worksheet he is not doing, and he glances up once and back down and the pencil makes a sound like decisions.

We sit on the couch and I write in the notebook today’s rungs: Lobby/ceiling. Gems bench. Pinned—scara—scarab. Saw Ted. No hissers. I write, Did not run from gift shop. I draw a box and make the check with a calm hand, and Cal adds a smaller box next to it with a dot inside. He tears a page of the Perot map off and tapes it to the notebook like that is how you make a shrine on $0.00. I chew a peppermint from Maribel’s bag until my mouth feels like someone cleaned the day.

After dinner—slow pasta again, which should be illegal but tastes like we survived twice—we take Baxter out and walk the block like normal men. The pecans buzz like a conference call. Cal points to the homework of cicada shells on the beds of the trees and I touch one and have no story left to tell it. At the corner, a palmetto clacks under the streetlight and I do not pretend I don’t hate the way it moves. Cal notices and doesn’t drag me to it or away from it. We stand an extra half minute in case my breath wants to earn a merit badge, and when it doesn’t, we walk because failing to be brave is not failing. At the 7-Eleven, Batman boy’s mother is buying a gallon of milk like it cost something she has and they both look tired in a way that feels like my reflection. The boy salutes me with a popsicle and says, “We had an election,” and I say, “How’d it go,” and he says, “It was fair,” and I decide I will carry that as a souvenir instead of a snow globe.

AFK_Cicada has written by the time we make it to the library for air I can trust. Their post is a long, kind list, a rope coiled where anybody can find it. They say: Lobby is brave. Rock rooms are brave. Pinned is brave. Ignore strangers who call bravery only the second of a live hiss. My first success: a case of beetles in a museum in a city you do not know. My hands stopped screaming while I read the labels. Celebrate muscle memory when it shows up. Celebrate your friend until he’s embarrassed. Eat something sweet. Go to bed dumb with relief. It finishes: When you get to sound at volume, tell the cicadas you brought your own band. I read it and feel my breath hold still for a second not because it’s scared but because it’s saluting.

Night slides onto the roof and pretends it’s always lived here. The cicadas switch from rehearsal to show. The moth’s ghost on my window has finally given up and the new ritual is the river in the ceiling that Cal named and I decided to pilot. Vic counts receipts under his breath like a man singing a bar’s worth of a song to himself so he doesn’t forget how it goes. Maribel folds dish towels into stacks like obedient clouds. Dre sits with a pencil balanced under his upper lip like a mustache and when Baxter puts his chin on his knee he pets the dog like he’s learned a new machine, carefully, like there’s a diagram. He glances at me and opens his mouth and closes it and the quiet after is a kind of language we will have to learn in chapters.

In bed, I take the museum map out again and touch the square that stands for the lobby with my fingertip. I smell cinnamon that isn’t there and the coffee in the morning waits like a promise with a cup underneath it. Cal texts a picture of the Perot stairwell, the one that shows you the city through the glass like a book someone punched a window into, and writes, Next time we pick one more room. I write back, Maybe the bugs that forgot to move, and he writes, Beetles are just metal leaves, and I write, Ted is an angel blueprint. The cicadas make their electrical fathers proud. I hum dumb Beach Boys into my pillow and do not feel ridiculous. I turn the page in the notebook and draw a new empty box that will need a check later, a little square like an open door. I fall asleep with my finger still on the lobby, the dinosaur bones like ribs over my head, the river in my ceiling going wherever we let it.Chapter 10

I wake under the dinosaur ribs I brought home in my head, the long curve of them still stretched over the ceiling crack river like a shelter I can call when the weather goes bad. The phone on the dresser is patient the way stones are, a little dark coin with a promise pressed into it. I do the box breath before I touch it, tracing the square on the air like a window I can put my face to without falling out. The house is a choir of ordinary: Vic’s spoon against his mug, Baxter’s claws skittering a signature on the stairs, the toaster giving its opinion about flame. Cinnamon still lives in the kitchen from last night’s candle, which means my brain will have something to hold while my eyes do their job. I press play and the little body on the screen runs its appointed line, a rumor more than an announcement, and the sound is only a throat two rooms away. I watch the corner of sky the phone makes like it’s a blue I can survive and count three, then a fourth that doesn’t fight me, then I flip the phone and tell myself that today I am allowed to eat the less-burnt corner of the toast.

Cal is posted at the mailbox like the city finally recognized his vocation and issued him a badge I can’t see. He lifts his eyebrows in a number and I answer in fingers because that’s our math, three and a maybe, and he answers with a ghost of a grin that leaves the rest of his face available to keep watch. The bus kneels and exhales a breath hot enough to make you forgive its timing, and the Batman boy has given up on titles altogether. “I’m just a person who knows things about ants,” he tells his mother with the resignation of a veteran. She says, “Constituent services,” while juggling a juice box and a phone, and I hope some part of me grows up into a mother like that if I ever get the chance to be anyone’s parent. The billboard has turned itself into a lake it wants to sell me for $499 down and twenty years of my life, which is just another way of saying this state knows how to dress up thirst.

In English, Mrs. Dannel gives us back our letters to our future selves like a magician returning a wallet from behind a stranger’s ear. She has circled two sentences in my messy block hand and underlined a verb like it had bones, and in the margin she wrote, “Keep your spine,” which I understand as both grammar and posture. The pasta girl has drawn a noodle next to my line about the lobby ceiling and written, “marry me, ceiling,” in a handwriting that thinks it can do romance and maybe can. When somebody reads theirs out loud about a father who isn’t around but echoes anyway, the room decides to stop being funny for a full forty seconds, which is a trick we only pull off twice a semester and today is one of the days. I tuck my own letter into the back of my notebook like a bill I plan to pay before the lights get cut and breathe the old coffee rising from the hall into the room.

Biology smells like plastic and paper and the cleaned-out ghost of the museum’s Bio Lab. Ms. Lowry has written IF and ONLY IF on the board again, this time with a line of small stars underlining each O like she is trying to teach us astronomy and boundaries all at once. The terrariums are asleep under towels that say Rest in bubble print that looks like it could float away if the vents were stronger. On my station she’s left the stag beetle encased in acrylic again, and next to it a smaller block with a roach that looks almost dignified behind its eternal air. It is the kind of dignity you only get when you cannot move and I can live with that. Her sticky note says, “Photographs made of glass—level 2,” with a smiley face that has one eyebrow raised, which is how she tells me this is both silly and serious. The kid behind me attempts the mouth-click that has replaced wit in certain corners of the species, and she deploys the full legal weight of his name with its inconvenient middle, and he collapses into his chair without crying about it. We label stamens again like repetition is an apology, and I let my finger trail the edge of the acrylic until the warmth persuades my breath to come back on schedule.

Under the crepe myrtle at lunch, the pink confetti sticks in the sweat at my temples and makes me look like a party nobody remembers arranging. Cal divides the fries into three segments with a gravity that would get him laughed out of any other religion and names them Past, Present, Rent, then eats Rent because he respects a bill. He turns the phone so we both own the risk, and we run the clip with the sound a notch higher, a murmur that could be a neighbor practicing a violin badly in a room with thick walls. I hold the gum wrapper against my face like a saint I designed and count the breaths until they belong to me instead of to the animal in my ribs who prefers to sprint. Dre passes within our weather without stirring it, hands empty, mouth neutral, eyes sliding off us like we are a piece of furniture he is trying to learn to live with. “Friday,” he says to the air, which could be a threat or an invitation or the name of a dog, and I choose invitation because the day is already heavy on the shoulders.

Coach kidnaps me with my consent between periods, a move he’s perfected so I keep thinking it was my idea. He makes me say cereal names while dribbling the left again and he watches the gym floor like it might become water, and when I get to “Raisin Bran Crunch” and don’t lose the ball he nods once like a judge stamping a form. “Set your feet like you pay rent,” he says, and when my shoulders forget to reach for my ears the ball obeys physics as if it always planned to. He steals one metaphor of mine and hands me a better one: “Stop being a visitor in a museum of your own bones,” he tells me, and it slides into my pocket like a coin I can fidget with when the elevator vibrates. The echo of the rim holds me together through two missed shots, which I decide to call progress because I refuse to build a theology out of perfection.

We make the pilgrimage to the library because some gods require us to show up even if we’re not asking for anything. Ray has arranged a stairway of field guides so tidy it feels like an invitation to pray: Rocks, Birds, Stars, Texas Insects, Texas Spiders, Texas—at a certain point I stop reading because the spines start looking like teeth again and I am not that brave on a Wednesday. He taps the stamp on the desk twice in a rhythm I think is for me, and I nod back because we are two men in a cult of paper who will never have to exchange vows to know the rules. In the computer corner, AFK_Cicada has left a paragraph the length of a breath. They write: Museums count as sprints. Homes are marathons. The day after a win is when my body decided to remind me what losing tasted like. Celebrate the physics that let you fall without leaving. Pair your next rung with a chore. Wash dishes while the sound runs. Fold shirts while movement sits in your lap. The part of the brain that learns the fold teaches the part that learns the fear. They finish with: When hearts relapse, do not file a police report. Let them come home without charges. I hold the screen between my hands and let the words heat them, then print the paragraph on Ray’s printer that adds a diagonal gray stripe to all wisdom like a scar on a handsome face.

We try it in the kitchen because the kitchen is a lab and a church and, too often, a battlefield. I line up the bowls like we own a restaurant that is too cheap to fail, and Cal balances the phone on the microwave with the speaker coated in cinnamon air from the spices box. We run a clip longer than any we’ve allowed into the house, two seconds of movement and a whisper of feet and the kind of sound the phone makes when it’s remembering an argument. I lower silverware into the drawer in sets of four because that is the box breath turned domestic, fork-fork-fork-fork, knife-knife-knife-knife, spoon-spoon-spoon-spoon. My throat does the hat trick it always does on the second beat and then remembers itself on the third, and when the fourth comes and we stop it on purpose, my hands have put away six cups without asking the rest of me for permission. Cal leans his hip against the counter and holds his breath with me because that is his job and he is good at it. “Again,” he says, which is faith in a single word, and we do it until the drawer is full.

The house decides to run its own experiment without asking us to sign a consent form. Maribel is at the stove stirring beans like a witch with the right kind of hex, and Vic is on the floor with a trash bag and a stack of junk mail that reproduces when you blink. Dre is at the table with his math, making faces at the numbers like they talked about his mother. Baxter patrols with the self-importance of a dog who once met a cop. The thing appears at the baseboard near the back door as if it registered that our lease doesn’t mention its kind by name and decided to test our convictions. It is large enough to be a noun and fast enough to be five verbs if I let it. My body throws all the levers a body has, and I feel the old elevator drop and the new ladder flex and I pick a rung and I hold it.

“Hey,” I say, because naming the moment is a spell. “Sir Clatters would like a ride.” The sentence would have been impossible in August and is only stupid now. Cal says my name like a handle you can trust and reaches for the cup we keep on the counter for this exact misadventure, the postcard with the Perot logo a tool with dinosaur bones grinning on the back. He doesn’t ask me to look. He doesn’t make a face. He performs the ceremony like somebody trained him in a desert. He scoops and slides and the cup claps against tile with that sound it makes when a problem learns its place. Vic is at his shoulder the way he always is, shovel at attention like an extra punctuation mark. Dre stands three feet back with his hands visible, and when the tail of the thing slaps once against the cardboard he flinches with his entire family tree and then forces his hands still because we are practicing staying.

“I’ve got socks on my hands,” he says to the air, to me, to the ghost of his grandmother’s kitchen, and I nod because the truth looks better in the open and because maybe he needs to hear himself say it and survive the room hearing it too. The parade goes out the back with an economy of motion, cup-postcard-shovel, and the kitchen fills itself with cinnamon and beans and old coffee like we were smart enough to prepare. I breathe against the edge of the counter and feel the paint cool under my palm and a small prize drop into my mouth without anyone handing it to me. Maribel flicks off the burner before the beans scorch and says, “Bueno,” in a tone that implies a whole thesis about domestic heroism. Baxter sits and pants in the corner as if he did something besides monitor.

When the back door closes and the problem belongs to the alley, Dre’s whole face does an equation. He looks at me like he’s practicing recognizing a person who made him feel smaller and didn’t cash in. “You didn’t run,” he says without the sneer he keeps ready for days when sleep lost. I shake my head and get to make a joke without having to weaponize it. “I told my heart you had the only sprinting contract for today,” I say, and the corner of his mouth acknowledges the idea that he is not the sole athlete in the house. He drops into a chair as if it owes him a seat and stares at the math like he might give it the dignity of an attempt. When he writes a number, the pencil is heavier than it was an hour ago.

Dinner jokes about being a feast, but even the beans are humble. Vic insists on a toast with paper cups. “To inspection passed, to lobby ceilings, to traps working, to receipts that agree with the math,” he says, and he looks right at me for the ceilings part like maybe you can give someone a medal without giving away your authority. Cal tries to harmonize on Beach Boys under the clatter of spoons and I roll my eyes for show and harmonize anyway because sometimes we need to put silliness in the air so fear has to share the room. Maribel pretends to swat us with a towel and misses on purpose. Dre steals an extra tortilla and doesn’t bother with stealth, which means he trusts the day to survive his appetite.

After dinner, when the dishwasher hums like an obedient train and the younger ones have built a fort under the table that violates every safety regulation we have, I take the notebook to the step outside and tape the Perot postcard so the bones peek out like a joke. I write: Kitchen in vivo. Cup. Postcard. Shovel. Socks on hands but not feet. Did not leave. Cinnamon did its ridiculous job. Under that I write, Relapse prevention: drawer chore + clip, and draw a square to promise myself I will keep making windows. Cal adds a tiny drawing in the margin of a horse with wings and labels it Ted out of pure malice, and I act mad and keep it because my book is a museum and accepting donations is part of the job.

We try the chore pair again with laundry because the dryer is still broken and folding demands respect. Cal runs the clip for two seconds, then two and a half, and we match it to t-shirts and towel halves and the slow business of making rectangles out of the day. My breath acts like it has learned something and then forgets, like a bad student who wants extra credit and doesn’t know what for. We stop by decision and not by panic, and when the last shirt sits in a stack that will topple by morning, I find a loneliness in my chest that isn’t empty, just quiet. “Better,” Cal says, and he means, You built a loop out of the moment before, and I nod because words are getting heavier and I don’t want to spend them badly.

The night wraps the house like aluminum foil over leftovers, making everything look shinier and more ridiculous. The cicadas ratchet the volume toward absurd because no one told them about restraint. The moths test the screens with their old excuses, and the ghost on my window is gone now, which means I have to choose a new ritual and not mourn the old one too much. Cal texts me a picture of his wrist with three boxes drawn on it and the last one checked, and underneath he writes, Today you were the neighbor, which is a sentence I did not know I needed until it appeared. I type back, Today you were the mop and the ladder both, and he sends a picture of a rope he made out of shoelaces like a threat if metaphors misbehave.

Morning does not knock. It uses a key and comes in anyway. The phone waits with one more beat on the clip, stubborn and generous, and I give it what I can and shut it down before any part of me starts writing to the governor. In the kitchen, Vic has left a note on the fridge in the handwriting my brain believes even when my body won’t: Friday optional. Lobby counts. Bring gum. I put the gum in my pocket and a pencil behind my ear because men in movies do and it looks like competence. Cal meets me at the mailbox and this time he doesn’t ask for numbers. He says, “I heard you not run,” in a voice that holds a medal behind its back. I brace the laugh that wants to be a sob and choose the laugh because other people need the air.

School is a machine that sometimes makes you feel like a person and sometimes like a part. English is the part with verbs in it and Mrs. Dannel keeps underlining bones like she is building me a skeleton we can both live with. Biology is the part with acrylic graves and a teacher who understands the science of consent. Lunch is the part with fries pretending to be wisdom and a friend who understands the physics of not touching. Coach steals the worst part of my afternoon and turns it into the one place where the room’s echo belongs to me. Dre ghosts in and out of my day with hands that have not practiced the spider recently, and every time he doesn’t do it, a corner of a room in my head changes color.

By the time we get to the library for our air appointment, Ray has swapped out one of the Texas Insects for a book with a moth on the cover whose pattern looks like armor left on a chair. He taps the stamp in our meter again, and I think about how he must choose his own rituals when he goes home and the desk doesn’t ask him to. AFK_Cicada has written a post shorter than the printer can comfortably handle without adding its gray diagonal. It says: When the live ones come, it is not a failure of planning. It is a weather pattern, a visitation, a reminder that the ladder is for days when the house is not burning. When the house smokes, you do not stand in the doorway and admire your carpentry. You walk out with your breath and your friend and the dog. Later, you write smoke in the notebook and draw a box and check it not because you enjoyed the smell but because you did not drown in it. It ends with: Name every tool you used out loud. The body catalogs success. It is a petty little scientist and we love her. Cal reads it twice in the voice he reserves for rules he intends to break only gently. I print it and tape it under yesterday’s shrine so my book smells like cheap toner and permission.

We walk the long way home past the canal because the horses are my new confession booth and I don’t want to break the habit. The bronze heat tries to peel us, but the water lies stubborn against the concrete and tells us their joke again: motion is a rumor; belief is the trick. Cal dares me to name the horses again and I pretend to resist and then do it anyway because repetition is an anchor, not an insult. “Lobby,” I say to the first one, and “Drawer” to the second, and when I get to the third I consider “Neighbor” and decide on “Ceiling,” because the world is immodest and sometimes you need something over your head that isn’t going to fall.

At Leland, Vic has dragged the ancient box fan out onto the porch like a relic, and it thrums at a pitch that makes my teeth feel like singing. Maribel is on the couch with a list and a pen and the authority of a mayor with a city that fits in a house. The little ones are combing Baxter with a brush that came free with a shampoo, and he is leaning into it like a man into a sermon he grew up with. Dre occupies the doorway between rooms like a threshold he is trying to claim. He watches Cal toss me the phone and I watch his hands not do anything I hate, and for a while, that is enough for everybody in the frame.

That night, after the dishes and the clip and the folding and the dog and the cinnamon, I sit on the edge of the bed and take the museum map out again. The lobby square is smudged now where my finger keeps landing, a tiny dark from my own oil, and the dinosaur bones on the postcard look like laughter to a person who has never laughed before. I put the gum on the nightstand like a talisman and write in the notebook: Two and a half seconds. Drawer. Forks. Spoon riot. Cup. Postcard. Shovel. Socks. I fill the square and ink the check carefully like I am defacing the day with love. Cal texts a picture of his ceiling crack river and a tiny paper boat he’s folded and taped to the plaster like vandalism. He writes, Tomorrow we ask the Bio Lab if Ted has cousins, and I write, Tomorrow we sit under the ceiling first and smell like breakfast, and he writes, The band is ready, and I listen to the cicadas like they are making an announcement I don’t have to attend because the walls are thin and the song will get to me anyway.
