The first time Valya saw the hospital from the top of the parking structure, it reminded her of a bleached bone half-buried in a riverbed. Light pooled in the lobbies and ran thin along the corridors. The night shift moved like minnows through water that smelled of antiseptic, citrus cleaner, stale coffee, a hint of sugar from the cafeteria that never slept. She crouched behind a cinderblock pillar and made herself smaller, a habit from another time when columns were trunks and trunks were pillars and the only light came from torches. She had learned that trick late, after the first refusals, after the first faces twisting with that delicate human recoil. Too big. Too much. Too strange. No.

Gloves are a disguise and a prison, she had read; not in any book but in the lines of her own hands. The gloves she wore were cheap black cotton snagged along the thumb seam. She hated them, but the nails beneath were wide and thick and ended in an enamel sheen that humans called monstrosity when the night was long enough. A scarf was wound high against her cheekbones, hiding the blunt curve of her teeth. She had filed them down on a sharp rock in one alluvial winter, far north of this city. Filing took patience. Pain is a rough polishing. Pain makes everything smooth.

Down below, a nurse exited through the sliding doors and into the cool delta of the early morning, the hour that belongs to people in uniform and to those who hunt them. Her badge swung at her chest, her hair braided with a rubber band that had broken once and been knotted again, professionally unprofessional. She held a takeout drink in one hand, a greasy paper bag in the other. Her thumb was bare, the nail short, trimmed to a working length. The thumb flexed, tiny muscle under skin; it pressed the edge of the paper bag, left a faint crescent of grease. Lovely thumb, thought Valya, something like admiration rising to a tremble in her throat. The thumb is the most human of artifacts. The thumb is a sign, a soft club, a map of pressure. The thumb can mean up or down. It can mean stay or go. It can press a pulse and measure it and call it life.

Valya raised her phone. She was not practiced with phones. The glass did not like her fingers. The software asked for passwords in small letters and numbers that wanted to slip away. But she could aim. She could squeeze. The camera shutter snapped like a tiny trap. The nurse did not see, not really. Someone looked from the doorway and glanced off her, the way rain glances off a hairy leaf. Valya took another picture and then another. The album on her phone was already full of skin close to the lens: thumbnails, thumbridges, the knuckle mound, the slant of a half-moon cuticle, a hangnail pulled ragged. Sometimes the thumbs wore polish, neon or blush. Sometimes there was a bandage. Sometimes there was nothing, and that was also something.

She posted later, one by one, to a Facebook page called Hands (public group), where no one asked why and plenty of people liked to look at what the body does when it becomes separate from the person. She didn’t write much—just a caption: a time of day, a single letter, a dot. Sometimes she put a word she didn’t understand. "Plinth," she wrote once. "Acetate," another time. Words are rocks in a pocket. You don't need to know what each rock is called to feel their weight. (But you can try.)

Down on the concrete, the nurse put her coffee on the roof of her car while she unlocked the door and for one reckless second passed her thumb across her mouth in a wiping motion, an unconscious self-blessing. For that heartbeat Valya could almost taste the salt of skin and the sugar of bakery treat and the copper of a coin pressed to the tongue as a child. She swallowed the old hunger. She took a step forward, an involuntary, foolish, hopeful step, as if the nurse might look up and say something like, "Are you lost? You can come inside. We'll find you something to do, something you can do." And then the nurse got into her car and drove away. The taillights blinked red—left-left-right, left-left, a rhythm Valya would keep in her head for hours like a tune.

She stayed until dawn creased the eastern sky, listening to the whispering bird-throat of the elevator shafts, the slapping of a mop against the concrete. The building warmed and the faces changed. Nothing said yes. No one said yes to the lurking shape, to the heavy shadow that nevertheless could move quiet as fog when she wanted to. When the morning came, she unscarfed her mouth and breathed, and her breath caught in her own teeth, and she laughed silently because that was how laughter had learned to come to her.

On the water in the east, at Lake Ming, a single shell cut a clean line across the surface like the needle of a seismograph marking calm. The oars dipped and rose, caught, drove, feathered, a calligraphy of movement that belonged to arms and shoulders and the long hinge of the back. The man in the boat was tall; you could see that even when he was hefted-down into the seat. His hair grew in stubborn waves that he tried to flatten with a cap that had once been navy blue and was now more the color of summer metal. He had rowed when he was young, by the Kern where it pretended to be safe. He had rowed farther north and then farther again, like somebody running numbers until they go to zero. He rowed now because there are habits you keep even when the reason for them goes missing. He rowed because motion can trick the mind into believing that time itself is moving.

Detective Humphrey listened to the water tick the hull. The sound didn’t travel as it should, he thought, and he thought that a lot in small ways. He had learned to endure echoes that broke apart in the wrong places, voices that went heard but not met, doors that opened and then did not remember opening. He had learned to walk among his colleagues and nod, and if they didn’t nod back he didn’t take it personal. He had been a detective for fourteen years, mostly property crimes at first, then the specialties no one wanted: threats, harassment, those crimes made of the little cuttings. Crimes that are just words until they're not.

Bakersfield, the old men say, is all engines and prayer and heat. He grew up smelling dust and petroleum and the nervous green of citrus groves under the frost cloth. His father had worked nights in a plant and slept from noon to three, and Humphrey learned to be quiet in a house where things were always coming or going. He learned a stroke that kept him straight down the course with as few corrections as the world would allow, which is to say: more than you want, fewer than you fear.

On his phone—old model, cracked at the edge where it had met the courthouse steps in a minor fit of gravity—an alert chimed with a sound like a glass key. He tapped, saw the message, and his shoulders tightened. "Heads up," it read, from his lieutenant, who signed without a name as if the two of them had a way of talking that didn’t require one. "We got nurses calling in about a stalker. Weird one. Social media angle. Your favorite." The link led to a news piece that was more of a gossip shiver than a report: Someone, someone strange, was shadowing nurses at three hospitals across the county, sometimes trailing them to their cars, sometimes appearing by the vending machines like an ugly memory. And someone's Facebook account, or maybe a Facebook group—it was hard to tell from the reporter's jargon—was filling up with close-ups of nurses’ thumbs. Just the thumbs. Nobody was touched, but nerves were frayed as wires.

Humphrey came to shore. He put the shell on the grass. He let his hands hang. At the far edge of the park a dog threw itself against its leash and then didn’t bark, and the owner said, "Hush," to the air. You had to take your moments where you could, so he chose one then, an exhale that took the stiffness out of his neck, and then he was in the Civic that had outlived three mechanics and two brakes jobs and that smelled faintly of other people’s food.

He drove. The sun was not up but it was thinking about it. Oil jacks pumped and nodded like black birds pecking at a hide. Humphrey turned the radio to a station that sometimes played jazz for four minutes at a time and then cut to a preacher with a tenor like a trumpet and then went back, without warning, to a traffic report. He drove past the campus, past the old library where evaporative coolers still clung to roofs like hats, past a billboard that said YOUR MOTHER CALLS ME MOMMY which made no sense except as a threat to language. The hospital sat low and wide. New wing to the west. He saw a nurse walking in wearing scrubs printed with cartoon strawberries—so much fruit in a desert. He could have parked in the visitors’ lot, but habit took him to the corner where the security staff smoked. They didn’t look up. He didn’t mind.

Inside, he asked the desk sergeant—there’s a desk like that everywhere—if he could leave a card for the head nurse. The sergeant was a woman named Jo with hair that grew bright coral red and then went to silver at the part. She shuffled a stack of tiny purple envelopes—the size of thank-you notes—and then slid his card into a place under a paperweight shaped like a turtle. "You got a meeting?" she asked.

"If I can get one," he said. "Anybody talking today?"

"They talk every day," she said, and her mouth took on a bitter humor. "They just don’t believe anybody’s listening."

He waited by a mural of a whale in a world that had no sea for it. He watched the shift change in reverse: night coming out, day going in. Nurses had a way of carrying themselves that made him think of acrobats, not because of flair but because of balance. The head nurse—a man named Miguel with a body like a pillar—came and stood near him and then seemed surprised to see him there. "Detective," Miguel said finally, after Humphrey had coughed once into his elbow. "I didn’t know you were—"

"Working," Humphrey said, and handed him the second card. A pause—not long enough to be rude, long enough to suggest that time had been passing around them at different speeds. Then Miguel took the card, held it by the corners, and read a name that looked like any other.

"I keep telling them not to walk alone," Miguel said. "But someone’s got to walk in and someone’s got to walk out, and not everyone has a spouse with a car and a schedule that matches. This one’s peculiar. You seen the pictures?"

"The thumbs," Humphrey said.

Miguel’s mouth twisted. "It makes people feel exposed," he said. "More than if it were… you know. The other thing. Because who thinks about their thumb? Your face is a mask you prepare, your hair, your clothes. Your thumb is your tool. It doesn’t have a costume. I got a nurse who says she won’t chart with her right hand anymore because she feels watched."

"Have you noticed anyone hanging around?" Humphrey asked.

Miguel made a list on his fingers of the men and women and once a teenager who had sat too long by the soda machine, who had tried to follow someone into a staff elevator with a lie on their lips, who had worn the wrong shade of blue scrubs. All of them human, all of them messy. "But this one," he said. "This one, the descriptions don’t make sense."

"In what way?" Humphrey said.

"Big, but… not tall? Heavy but quiet. Some say she’s got a scarf pulled up like a bank robber. Some say she smells like lemons. Some say like… you’re gonna laugh."

"I won’t," Humphrey said, and for a moment his eyes were serious enough that Miguel didn’t question the promise.

"Like wet dirt," Miguel said, and smiled anyway, self-preventing.

Humphrey didn’t laugh. He remembered the Kern after the release from the dam, the way it carried the smell of the mountains to the flats, that mineral breath. "Anyone see a vehicle?"

"Nothing consistent," Miguel said. "She might take the bus. She might be the bus."

"Do you have a policy on security escorts?"

"We do," Miguel said. "And we use it when we can. But you know. Staffing. And it feels like… if you lock it all down then the whole place changes shape. You stop being a hospital."

"I’ve seen it," Humphrey said. "Places bristling." He put his hands in his pockets and felt the folded paper of a note he had written for himself and then forgotten to read: call back the high school principal; check the box again. He never wrote notes in his phone. The habit seemed to have died a natural death. Strange, the idiom.

A nurse walked by, young—no, not young, just new. Her name was hand-lettered on a badge in black Sharpie as if she had just introduced herself to the job and was waiting for it to write her back. She looked at Humphrey as if she could almost see him clearly. She blinked, and whatever clarity almost came to her, it didn’t stay. The air hummed. Somewhere a machine complained and then accepted its fate.

He left a flyer with the desk; he took a photograph of the hallway without knowing why. The light on the far door rippled when there was no reason for it. He told himself he was tired. He told himself to sleep and said it again like a prayer worth hearing.

Valya walked the long curve of a block where two veterinary offices faced each other like brothers who won’t speak. Her feet were bare in her shoes, the cracked leather softening with the sweat and the surety of her step. She had slept under an overpass not far from the train yard and a place that sold tires along with churros and she had dreamed she was deep in a burrow of bedsheets, the cotton smelling of somebody’s laundry soap, and the dream had woken her hungry for that kind of clean. The morning trucks bellowed. She pulled her scarf aside to taste the air with her mouth, with her tongue. The city smelled of many thumbs—grease and graphite, sunscreen, coins, fruit, ink, starch, old bread. She had a list, written with a pen in block letters on a blank receipt: Mercy Southwest. Adventist. Memorial. She crossed them off and wrote them again. Crossed them off and wrote them again.

She had wanted yes once, a bright clear yes that would set her bones in order. The first time she had asked for it she had stood on the margins of a summer party and listened to the ticks of ice in the glasses and to the faint echo of someone’s music through bad speakers. When she stepped forward the light caught her teeth and someone had said, “Oh Lord,” not as a prayer but as a wall. She had gone to conversational English classes in a basement with a broken fan and a teacher with a star tattoo behind her ear, and when it came time to pair up the teacher had looked to the back of the room where Valya sat, had paused, had said, "You can partner with me, if you like," and the room had turned its head at the word like. She had tried to make her voice round and smaller, and still the sentence broke against the hidden parts of her.

If she had a myth, it would be that she grew stronger when someone said no. Not taller. Not sturdier. Not something you could measure with bus stop schedules or tape. But sharper. More focused, light cut into a knife. The no cleared away the fog of the day and gave her a line to walk.

On Facebook, her post garnered twelve likes and two comments. One said, "This is gross," and one said, "Art." The profile pictures were of other hands, sunsets, a tree. She looked through them until the motion itself soothed her. Sometimes she clicked on a name with a red cross next to it and followed the breadcrumb trail of pictures: travel photos, the same view of a backyard taken month after month, a badge in a mirror, a hand in a glove pointer finger raised as if it were enough to point and the world would go where it ought. She read the words in the captions slowly, letting them melt. She wrote a message to someone once: "Do you like coffee of the morning?" She never sent it.

Detective Humphrey sat in the station and listened to the noises of a building built for noise. The windows trembled at nothing. A fan moved shadows around the ceiling panes. His partner—nominally, because in the last few months they had worked cases like people standing ten feet apart throwing a ball and pretending to read each other’s eyes—leaned into his cubicle and said, "You see this?" and didn’t wait for an answer. "My sister’s a nurse," the partner said. "She’s got a thumb like a drumstick. Think I should tell her to cut it off just in case?"

"Tell your sister to keep her company walking out to her car," Humphrey said, without looking up from a printout he wasn’t reading. The printout was a record of posts from the group with the medical hands and the odd jokes and, hidden in the pile, the crisp images that made him want to press his thumb into his palm until it hurt. "Do you got anyone on security tapes?"

"You can give it a shot," the partner said. "Half the cameras show coffee cups and ceiling tiles. Half the time they’re only recording whatever we don't care about. But you know that."

Humphrey nodded. He closed his eyes, and in that instant the department’s phone rings blurred into the sound of a wooden oarlock, an old kind he had only seen in pictures. When he opened his eyes, he was in the same place. He breathed in and it tasted like a familiar finish line: everybody cheering for something that had already happened.

He drove to the first hospital on his list, then the second. He walked the corridors and let the fluorescents wash him, thinly holy. He parked where he shouldn’t, because habits are their own permission. When he spoke to a man in a jacket that said SECURITY in white block letters, the man looked at his mouth and then into the distance, trying to capture the voice that didn’t seem to stop at two ears. Humphrey tightened his tie because that had helped once. He held up his badge because metal is a kind of fact.

"She’s bold," the security man said. "And when they describe her, I get—" He made a motion in the air, like erasing a whiteboard. "Like there’s a gap between what they see and what their words are trained to do."

"You got any video?" Humphrey asked.

"Maybe," the man said. He played something back for him: a parking lot at night, the frame flickering. A shape moved between cars, the kind of shape static makes when it tries to be a person. It was shrouded—no, it was draped—no, it was present and also wrong. Humphrey leaned forward. He used the notepad in his mind, careful, tidy. He wrote: heavy voice in the camera. He wrote: smell of dirt. He wrote: she might be the bus.

He followed that crack in the day until it widened. At a corner near the entrance, there was a bulletin board full of flyers: lost cats, blood drives, a tutoring service with tear-off tabs. The center of the board was an ad for a rowing club in town that still met twice a week for anyone who wanted an early discipline. He saw his own past stapled there and felt nothing and everything; the seeing was there, the feeling was behind glass. Someone brushed past him, the static from their coat raising the hair on his wrists where the watchband lay.

When he went outside, the air had changed. The light had slipped sideways, as if time had rolled off a roof and landed in a puddle. The nurses kept coming and going. One of them, a woman in her forties with tired eyes and a riot of pins on her backpack, stood with her phone held high, eyes skimming a Facebook group that was hers and not hers. "If I see her," she said to no one, to everyone, "I’m going to ask her what’s wrong with her. It’s not right. People have lives. You don’t get to take them and make them into… into a thumb. Into just a thumb."

At the far side of the lot, a figure leaned into the shadow of a cypress-heavy fence. The figure didn’t flinch when a car passed and threw light that should have shown more than it did. The figure waited, and if you could have measured waiting as a full-body exercise, this would have been a good example. Humphrey walked toward that space as if it were a person, and perhaps it was. He thought he saw a scarf. He thought he saw—he thought he saw something wide and strong, the kind of bulk that belongs to mountains and trees, thickened with old judgments.

"Ma’am," he said. "Ma’am, can I talk to you?" The words left his mouth and did their best.

The figure tilted its head. A scent came to him, old and clean at once, like a cupboard where a bar of soap has been stored for years next to sacks of earth. He heard the smallest sound that might have been the rasp of a glove moving against rough concrete. He took another step. The sound of a horn escaped a car in the distance as a kind of social sneeze. When he looked back—because something told him to look back—the woman with the pins was watching her phone so intently that if her thumb had been taken in that moment she wouldn’t have known it until the lack of it evidenced itself in her.

When he turned again, the figure was gone. His pulse stepped into a faster room.

Valya moved along the fence and around to the alley where the garbage bins were lined up like exhausted soldiers. She disliked the stink and the rot that ran from their seams, the sourness of milk and the dead sugar of soda. But she was good at narrow ways. She could slip. In a space where two vans were parked nose to nose like kissing horses, she paused to touch the side of the vehicle, just to feel the heat. She imagined the man with the badge might be near. He had a smell of river about him. Not drowning. Not yet. But something off-water, the residue of moving under a sky that reflected you while you reflected it.

She crouched until the world got simpler. Knees to the ground. Elbow on knee. The learning began, as it always did, with listening. A voice—his voice—was low and even, a good voice for persuading a door to open. He called to her again, but not with her name. He didn’t know her name yet. She swallowed. Names are anchors and knives; you have to be careful which you choose to be.

After, when the sun did rise and made promises it didn’t plan to keep, she went to a diner where the pancakes always tasted as if the batter had been mixed last night and the syrup had been born under a different flag. A nurse sat at the counter with a bright blue plastic lunch box in her lap, tapped in a code on her phone, and grinned into whatever came back. The nurse’s thumbs were short and squared off and carried the story of a scar at the base of one nail. Valya could not help herself. She took a picture. The shutter click was drowned out by the hiss of the flat-top. Her heart, which had been patient up until then, struck once against her ribs like a stone thrown at a window. The nurse glanced around, caught Valya’s eye and did not call the waitress, did not say anything, made a face not of pity but almost of curiosity, as if asking, What? What do you want with this part of me?

Valya felt heat rise from her throat to her cheeks and to the spot in her jaw where the filed-down edge of a tooth sometimes remembered its old shape. She pressed the phone down under the table. She didn’t look away. The nurse didn’t either. The waitress arrived, set down a plate with economy, said, "Syrup’s on the table. You take care of yourself now," to the nurse, and left. The nurse’s thumb came down on the lid of the lunchbox, clicked it open, closed, open again, as if she were practicing a kind of Morse that could jump across people.

Out in the parking lot, the detective watched the window and caught a reflection he did not quite recognize as his. He had never loved the parking lot detective work. It made you feel like a divorce lawyer with a camera in a tree. He waited anyway, a pause that could be filled with coffee, with an email, with two good minutes of closing your eyes and not dreaming. He checked the in-box. Another link, from someone who had no patience for paper: a new post on the group. The picture was crisp. The thumb had a scar near the base of the nail. The caption: "It is a blue day. it is a blue."

He looked up and saw both of them, the nurse and the woman in the scarf, walk out into the light. The nurse stopped on the mat to adjust a strap. The woman paused, too, because the nurse had paused. Their bodies have a way of doing that—a choreography of strangers. Humphrey crossed the space between in what he hoped was a natural gait. Too fast and you spook a deer; too slow and you lose the chance you’re given.

"Ma’am," he said softly, between them, eyes on the scarfed face, lifting his badge so it could do its part. "I think we should talk."

Valya’s eyes flicked to the piece of metal he was holding, read it as it sat between the lines of light, tried to match the shape of the letters to the things they were meant to represent: authority, structure, boundaries, bricks. She looked at his mouth. His lips made a shape that meant: not danger, not yet. His eyes made a shape that meant: of the river. She wanted to say, no. She wanted to say, yes. A few feet away, the nurse watched and held her breath in the way people do when nothing is happening and everything is.

"Are you the—" Humphrey began, and stopped himself. You do not name something that is barely willing to stand still long enough to be spoken to. He remembered the rowlocks’ rhythm, their click, their giving. "I’m not going to hurt you," he said, and realized in the same breath that he had said a foolish, impossible thing. On a morning when a man in a badge says I won’t hurt you to a person in a scarf and a diner, what does it even mean?

Valya did not step closer, but the sense of her did. He could see the thickness of her wrists inside the glove, the breadth of her knuckles. Her eyes were not small. They were older than her face. He had no idea how old her face was. He was reminded, absurdly, of rolling clouds over the highway up past Keene, shadows moving over fields. He waited for the sound of a train. He didn’t hear one.

"You take pictures of hands," he said instead. "Of thumbs. Can you tell me why?"

"Because they are the places where a person touches the world," she said, the words assembled one by one like blocks, carefully because the spaces between them were chasms. Her voice had a rasp that would have been menacing if she had wanted it to be. She did not want it to be. She wanted something to be understood, and wanting is the most exposed thing any of us can do.

"You’re scaring them," he said, and he said it as gently as his mouth knew how. "They think you might do more than take a picture. We see this and then we see worse. I don’t want worse to happen. I want you safe, too."

The nurse shifted her weight and in that small movement you could feel a dozen long nights in a ward, the push of a heavy door with an elbow, the signing of your name again and again in small boxes where nothing is big enough to fit. "Are you going to take her in?" the nurse asked. Her tone had not decided what to be.

"I don’t know yet," Humphrey said without a smirk. "I’d like to understand. That’s allowed, sometimes, today. Ma’am—" He paused again, and then did something different with his voice, held it out flat like a tray. "My name is Humphrey."

"Humphrey," Valya said, tasting the sound without meaning to give away that she was tasting it. "You are like the water," she said, foolishly perhaps. "You go in lines and you think the lines will save you." He did not smile. His eyes did something like hurt. She lowered the scarf a fraction. For an instant she forgot about the filing she had done. The nurse’s face flinched and then didn’t, trained muscle. Humphrey didn’t flinch. He did the smallest thing with his shoulders that meant: I’m still here.

Behind them, somebody hailed somebody else and the day sank down to another layer with the noise of two instruments tuning. Valya took a step back. "I only take pictures," she said. "I only make an album. Albums are for families. They have pictures of what you are."

"You could ask," the nurse said unexpectedly, mouth surprised by its own betrayal. "You could ask me. I might say yes. Then it wouldn’t be… It would be different."

Valya looked at her in a way that made the nurse reevaluate what she had already decided. "Do I ask for what I want once," Valya said, "and then what do I do when it is not given? Then I am only a thing that asks and is told no. Again. Again." She swallowed. Her throat moved like an old root. "Better to make my own."

"That's not better," the nurse said, and her voice was sharper than she had planned. "That's just lonely."

Humphrey breathed in the silence that followed and held it as if it were a glass he didn’t want to spill. He wanted to say the right thing. He wanted to say, come in, we’ll sit down, we have forms, we have warmth, we have a room that doesn’t make you into a shadow. He wanted to say, this isn’t going to be one of those stories. He wanted to say, my hands are open. Instead he said, "Let’s—" and the word hung there.

Then there was a sound, small and stupid: a coffee cup tipping off the roof of a car, hitting the ground with a hollow thud, and coffee slicking across asphalt in a dark map. The nurse said, "Shoot," without real heat and jogged over to save what she could. Valya’s eyes tracked the spill as if it could tell her something she needed to know, and in that second she pulled on the scarf, turned, and moved in a way that humans always mistake for disappearing because they forget how many doors there are in a day. Humphrey followed to the edge of an alley and stopped because there was nothing to push against. He made a decision: not to chase, not yet. Some animals are best followed with patience. Some people are, too.

Back at the station he filed his report in the system, typed with a steady rhythm that made the keys into oars. His partner leaned back into the doorway and said, "I thought this was just a Facebook creep."

"It is," Humphrey said, and left room for the also. He pulled up the album again and looked at the pictures—those poor, unthought-about thumbs, all of them suddenly heavy with meaning. He recognized the blue day thumb now. He leaned back. He closed his eyes. He saw a river with no boats. He saw a parking lot with a shadow that tasted like what the earth tastes like when rain comes after five months of not.

As dusk pressed its face against the windows, Valya found herself under a bridge where someone had painted in long thin letters: WE WERE HERE. The letters were pale, as if regret and chalk had had a baby. She traced them with her finger. On the screen of her phone, a new like appeared and then another. She turned the volume down so the pings wouldn’t sound like coins dropped somewhere in the dark. She put her hand over her mouth and felt the pressure of her own palm, the steadiness of the bones underneath. She thought of the man who had water eyes and who had not told her yes or no and who had not, which was something, not laughed.

She leaned back against the pillar and hummed, a song with no melody, and the concrete hummed back. Up above, cars crossed in lines. Down below, the river ran. It ran whether you wanted it to or not. That’s the problem with water and with time—they don’t take advice. She thought, foolishly again, of a family album where a thumb held down the corner of each picture so that it wouldn’t lift up and reveal the world was a trick. She thought, tomorrow, then. Tomorrow: Mercy Southwest, Adventist, Memorial. Cross them off, write them again. And she thought of a door with a badge and a voice like wet sand and a way of saying her name that he did not know yet, as if he could make a path through the thicket of rejections she had fed on and watered, and maybe—maybe—that path might be something that did not end in a cliff. The night thickened. She held the phone in her grip and the screen lit the undersides of her fingers in a glow that made them look like they were full of honey. She tried to sleep. The city didn’t say yes. It didn’t say no, either. It said: we were here.

The lake in the morning was an eye that had forgotten to blink. Humphrey slipped the shell into it and felt the boat’s small shiver like a held breath. He set his hands and pushed away. The oars settled into their pockets and he began again, the old movement, the backswing, the catch, the drive. Someone watched from the bank, or he thought they might be watching; a boy with a bicycle and a dog that didn’t bark. He breathed in the thin, clean burn and thought of the scarfed woman standing in light like an animal at the edge of a field. He wondered if she would be at the west entrance this time. He wondered if the nurse with the scarred thumb had put a bandage on it to hide it or to protect it or to claim it. He wondered at the strange fact that everything you touch is touched by your most human part and nobody tells you that until late. He rowed. He counted in fours until the numbers meant nothing and meant, somehow, everything.

He did not notice the way the boat left no wake for a few yards longer than it should. He did not notice the silence that came when a flock of geese changed direction and flew through where he should have been. He did not notice the way the light sometimes went through him and didn’t slow down. He had a case. He had a city. He had a rhythm. He had water. He had a name that was good enough to say in the rain. He didn’t need anything else. Not this morning. Not yet.The nurse with the scar at the base of her thumbnail had a name that was written cleanly on labels and receipts and the insides of lunchboxes, but at work it got shortened by everyone into the same sound that fit into the traffic of a ward. Elena became El, a syllable that lifted and fell with the beep of a monitor. The scar was from a door at an old job that had swung back too fast; it wasn’t a heroic story and that pleased her in some perverse way because nurses knew the difference between stories and the bones they wrap around. On the night after the diner, she charted with her left hand for two hours out of sheer spite at nothing in particular and then switched back because the numbers looked like vague islands with bad harbors. The thumb on her right hand throbbed in a phantom, not from pain but from attention; ever since she had seen the picture, it felt like a part of her had been detached and inspected under light and then returned out of place. When she held a pen, she could see the soft armor of the nail in her mind as if she were wearing her own glove inside her skin. Some people sing when they can’t sleep. Elena alphabetized her fear: Badge. Cars. Dark. Elevator. Phones. She went to Z and felt like she had outrun it and then came back to A because the day restarted without asking.

On her break she walked the loop indoors because the parking structure at night had taken on the logic of a dream where you remember you are barefoot only after you step on glass. She passed the window cutouts where the vending machines pressed their faces to the glass like aquarium fish, lit from within by the cold glow that makes candy look like relics from a planet where sugar is currency. A man stood there too close to the red spiral of the chip machine, his jacket too thick for the weather, not dirty but used in the way that some things take on the shape of a habit. He was looking not at the snacks but at the reflection of whoever passed behind him, using the dark glass as a mirror. Elena kept her walk regular, the pace of a person who has a destination and is not late, and the jacket man did nothing but let his eyes perform that ancient predator math: size, speed, attention. She went back to the ward in a calm that had cost her ten good breaths. She had texted her sister earlier to say, without naming names, that a detective had talked to the thumb woman in the parking lot and that it had felt strange and strangely careful, like a cat bringing a bird to a doorstep and then sitting back to see what the household would do. Her sister had written back, “Sounds like a story you tell me to make me stop worrying,” and then a row of hearts because love holds all the silly emojis like beads on a string.

Humphrey spent that day inventing reasons to go back to Mercy Southwest, then calling those reasons in to himself as if a voice on a different line could override the previous caller. He had promised no one anything in particular, but that had not stopped him from feeling accountable to an expectation that nobody had written down. The admin for the Facebook group returned his message in the form of a shrug typed in polite sentences. Anyone can post, the admin wrote. It’s public. We take down anything that’s just gore, or that shows kids without a parent saying okay. We don’t know what you want us to prevent, officer. People are weird. The little circle in the corner of the message showed a hand holding a paintbrush. Humphrey typed with two fingers and his doubts. He asked for time stamps. He asked about repeat posters. He asked in a way that left enough room to be wrong. When the answer came, it was a list of numbers and IP addresses that cloaked themselves behind a coffee shop and a library and the free Wi-Fi of a city that had decided to try being generous with bandwidth if not with much else. He printed it out because paper felt like a floor where you could look for footprints, and the paper made a soft sound when it left the tray, the sound of something falling in a room where the window is shut.

He called the security office and asked that escorts walk in twos, then threes, then be taken more seriously than an addendum. He said it knowing that people do their best until the best runs out and then they come back the next day and do their best again. He stood in a hallway and watched the motion of a group of nursing students behind glass making into bandaging their awkwardness around mannequins with mouths forever on a last vowel. He watched a hand demonstrate pressure above a fake artery, thumbs placed just so, a teacher’s voice making a shape in the air that said here and not farther. He felt the old urge to put his fingers near the glass like a child at an exhibit. He didn’t. The light skipped over him once like a flat stone and then didn’t come back.

Valya learned the morning habits of the man who said his name like a thing he had chosen and kept. He rowed. He drove. He carried a lunch he did not eat and a thermos that kept coffee warm until warmth ceased to mean anything. He spoke to the person at the desk and looked at the board and nodded at the guard in the cove of cameras. He wore a ring and did not. He wore a watch that told the same time as the sun and did not. If he was a ghost then he was a stubborn one because he parked badly and he had the kind of humor that makes a seam in a room when you need something to hold on to. She liked the way his eyes tried and then failed and then tried again. She liked that he stood where she stood without crowding the edges. She did not like that when he said, “They’re scared,” something in her opened like a mouth and she could not get it to close because the wind had been waiting a long time for that particular aperture.

She made herself ask once. She stood near the smokers’ corner and waited for a nurse with a long face and laughter that had to get past a thousand tiny locks before it could be free. The nurse smoked like a person who knew they shouldn’t but also knew that should is a poor diet. Valya looked at the cigarette with a chemist’s interest and the ash with the interest of someone for whom ash had a memory. “Can I take a picture,” she said, lining up the words the way children arrange wooden blocks, making sure the colors weren’t too bright all together in case brightness scared away animals. “Of your—” She shaped her own thumb in a gentle hooked fist, embarrassed by the pantomime of it.

The nurse flinched invisibly and then, surprising both of them, blew smoke out in a ribbon and stared at her own hand as if it belonged to a friend who had not stopped visiting no matter how many times the door had been left unopened. “Why,” she asked, and it was the right question, but it came out with a tiny hook on it as if it wanted to catch some other fish.

“Because it is the place where you hold. The place where you press a button that calls someone else. Because it is less guarded, and what is less guarded is closer to the truth,” Valya said, and then blushed because she had made a thing out of it and sometimes making a thing out of something is how you break it.

The nurse thought and took a slow drag and then flicked off the ash with the same thumb and looked at the tiny moon she had made at the nail’s edge years ago by slamming a car door too fast in a rainstorm. “No,” she said, and said it kindly, which is a particular talent. “Not today,” she added, and turned away. It was worse than a sharp no and better than a slap, and Valya bent her head for a heartbeat because a habit is a groove and you find yourself in it even when you had meant to walk on pavement. She took no picture. She put the phone in her coat pocket and it pressed warm against her ribs like a small live thing she would have to feed later if she didn’t want it to start crying.

The other man didn’t smell like wet dirt or lemons or a river in a hurry. He smelled like nothing you notice until after, when you go through a room and there’s a coolness as if the air doesn’t want to stay. He had been watching a particular strip of sidewalk between the emergency bay and the pay box. He had been practicing the timing of doors because thresholds have habits same as people. He had looked at the group page and laughed without humor because he had found a way to be worse than a picture of a thumb and to blame the picture for being the map to the territory. He wore a uniform not of scrubs but of ubiquity: sweatshirt, cap, face that the mind refuses to keep because keeping such things feels like carrying a family of stones of different, unwelcome weights.

What he did at Memorial on the third morning was what people do when they are not enough and decide to borrow from fear to make up the balance. He came too close to a nurse named Sita who had worked twelve hours and had a laugh that swerved from gravel to bells and was not interested in anyone’s opinions about it. He said her name without having earned the right to it because names leak out of badges like water through old pipes. He put his hand on her elbow in that way some men think is a gesture and is really a leash. She pulled away and said a word that in this county can be either a prayer or a weapon, and he didn’t care which it was. A bus went by and gave them a little audience and took it back.

Humphrey had spent the early morning pretending to have errands on the opposite side of the county, but he had doubled back and now stood by the shadow of the loading dock thinking very intently about how to become visible. Jo from the desk had given him a half smile when he’d borrowed a flashlight for an hour he had no justification for. Visibility, it turns out, lives in the marrow of your attention, and if you point it hard enough at the world, sometimes the world looks back. He had learned that from shells and from suspects and from the one time he read about hunting deer and laughed out loud at the part where a man said he had to become a tree. He heard Sita’s voice the way you hear your own name at a party when no one has said it out loud and he moved before consulting the committee.

He wasn’t first. He wasn’t even second. In the space between the scrubbed brightness of the doors and the open, indifferent sky, something else stepped into the scene as if it had always been given that job and had only been late because there had been a road repair. Valya came out of the sliver between the bank of shrubs and the concrete abutment, the green leaves whispering their startled apology at where they’d kept her hidden, and put her hand—not a nail, not a claw, not a threat, just her palm—on the wrist of the man who had made Sita flinch. There was no wrench. There was no throw. There was pressure in the small way that surgeons stop bleeding. The man made a sound that was both insult and surprise and then another, stranger sound that belongs to the moment when a story you thought you were writing on someone else turns out to be being written on you. Sita stepped back two steps and then a third, and that third was the one that put her breath back in her chest. A second nurse—Elena with the scar—appeared because news moves along corridors like heat through pipes, and she had a way of moving toward trouble the way some people move away from it. Humphrey arrived in time to see the man try to shake his way free and find that shaking was a dance you do when your partner agrees. He did not agree.

“Hey,” Humphrey said, the hey of a man whose hey had once ended storms at schoolyard fights, and then he said the man’s name because he had read it off the back of a ticket stub in a near pocket in the hour before when the man had been waiting in a vestibule that thought it was safer than it was. The name made the man’s face do that thing faces do when the police have known them too well in other contexts. Valya released his wrist in a motion so small it looked like reflection. The man did that square-shouldered move that says Shove, that says Courage, that says I bet the line will part for me the way it always has, and then found it didn’t and had to make a new plan on the ground, which he wasn’t good at.

After, with the man escorted into a room where the lights were a different, institutional kind of moral, and with Sita holding her elbow as if it had been touched by a cold front, Humphrey turned to Valya and saw the way her breath had gone ragged and tried to organize itself. He saw that she was angry, which he had not expected, and that the anger wasn’t at the man. It was at the shape of the day that kept providing her with No in different costumes. The security man who had tried to pretend his eyes did not slip past things now looked at her as if the lens had adjusted. Elena stared hard, and when Valya looked back she saw recognition that was not the kind we usually want when we walk into a room.

“You can’t just—” the security man began, and Humphrey cut him off gently with a palm that had forgotten its callouses but remembered the gesture. “She just did,” he said, and he said it so mildly that the sentence didn’t raise any hackles, which is a gift and a decision. He turned to Valya and looked at her scarf and then at the place where the scarf let one inch of skin out to make a promise. He said, “Thank you,” and in his mouth it sounded like a question with an answer built into it. She blinked like someone not used to that particular order of words, and then unlearned a little bit of one small defensive thing.

“Do I get in trouble for a picture,” she asked Elena, deadpan without trying to be. It was the wrong moment and it was the only moment she had. Elena, who had arrived ready to be angry at the world’s insistence on making her work on a broken machine and then pretend it’s fine, surprised herself and everyone else by lifting her phone. Her hand didn’t quite shake. She looked at her own thumb as if it had told a good joke without her permission. She turned her hand palm up, palm down, in a small dance that felt like a ritual somebody had forgotten to name. “Ask me,” she said, not unkindly and not with grace, but with the bare equivalent of grace that is sometimes called human.

“Can I make a picture to keep,” Valya said, and this time it felt like stepping into the river where the current looks friendly and then taking another step when you find out it is trying to take you elsewhere.

“Yes,” Elena said, as if she were not just answering a question but writing a rule she had made herself. “Yes, you can. Just don’t… don’t make me into just the place where I touch the world. Remember the rest of me sometimes if you can.”

“I remember,” Valya said, and whether it was true or not then, she would make it true later by carrying the weight of it like a bag of stones she did not want to put down. She took the picture without the tiny trap sound because the coffee from the hallway had seeped into her phone when she had put it down while adjusting her scarf an hour earlier and the speaker had softened. The image was crisp anyway. The scar at the base of the nail looked like a small flag on a map, and the lines on the knuckle looked like roads no one takes anymore because a highway was built that cut the walking towns in half. Elena pulled her hand back when the shutter did not speak because sometimes silence is rude when you expect a sound. They both laughed awkwardly and then everyone stopped laughing because some things don’t like to share space with mirth, and one of those things is the aftermath of almost.

Humphrey stood stupidly with his hands in his pockets and then took them out and then put them back in because he did not know where to put them anymore. He wanted to tell someone that they had done good work here and that he was proud, and then he remembered that he did not own the right to that sentence. He asked Sita if she wanted to file a report and she shrugged in that way you sometimes do when you believe in systems in theory and find that in practice you’re tired. “We’ll walk you out. Together. Tonight. And tomorrow,” he said, knowing full well that tonight is a promise and tomorrow a wager.

The report he wrote later had two columns in his head and one column on the paper. In the paper column, the man’s name and the date and the location and the particularities turned into words the way you turn small scrubby trees into a fence: it works from a certain distance. In one column in his mind was the story he would tell himself if he were permitted that intimacy: a woman smelling of wood and clean dirt and winter put her hand on a man’s intention and changed it. In the other column, she did a thing that might be called vigilantism if anyone wanted to get promotion credit for saying so, and the world is short on neat moral lines even in the better neighborhoods. He kept his handwriting even. He crossed his ts without violence. He felt like a person looking for a trail marker and finding instead a handmade shrine with a candle stub and a few coins under a flat rock.

Valya spent that evening with the bridge pillars the way children who think they are animals wrap their arms around tree trunks to show the tree where the boundaries are. She took the consented picture and wrote a caption with care. It said, “Permission,” and then she wrote after it, “El,” and then a dot, and then erased the dot, and then put it back because she liked the weight it gave to stop. The likes came and did not repair anything in her that needed the real thing, but the names collected at the bottom of the post like shells and that felt like a tide she could believe in for the duration of a battery charge. She closed her eyes and put her thumbnail into the callus near the base of her index finger because that was how she measured whether a day had added to her or scraped her away. The city hummed its indifferent hymn, the one that includes the hiss of sprinklers on a median and the clack of skateboard wheels and a crow that has found a chip bag and decided it is a gift. She imagined the man with the water eyes writing his other report, the one that has no form, and she allowed herself the indulgence of picturing her name at the top of a piece of paper he would fold and fold again until it was small enough to put into his wallet between an old photograph and a library card. She imagined, too, that the card would be stamped with a date from two years ago and that he would have meant to go back and never did, not because he didn’t love books but because the building did not notice him the way buildings are supposed to and it’s a peculiar shame not to be noticed by a place that stores attention.

Elena, on her couch with her lunchbox open the way people open their lives when they are too tired to put everything away properly, looked at her own hand on a stranger’s screen and experienced something like the cracking of a window in a hot room. It wasn’t escape. It was air. She typed a sentence that she deleted and then typed it again less carefully and then did not send it because nobody needs to know every time you have an open window. She did text Sita to ask if she was okay. Sita sent back a voice memo because spelling was a bridge too far tonight, and in the memo she said, “That woman was like a mountain that remembered it could move, and that man is going to learn one day that doors open without him pushing. I think I’m okay. Come with me to my car until the end of time.” Elena wrote back, “Fine but only if you carry my bag when I get old,” and Sita wrote, “You already old,” and sent a picture of a sunset over a strip mall because sunsets over strip malls are as valid as other sunsets if you love a place enough to give it the benefit of your grief.

Humphrey slept badly. He dreamed of water doing a thing water does not do: holding a shape. He woke to a set of texts from his lieutenant that were almost tender in the way absence of criticism can be. He went to the lake and the water lay like a metal sheet someone had buffed for hours. The shell took him out into a morning with no birds where there should have been birds. He counted in eights, then in sixes because the numbers slid, then abandoned counting because the part of his brain that keeps time said it needed a day off. On the far bank, a boy in a hoodie threw rocks at nothing. The dog that did not bark had been replaced by one that did and the sound carried as if the air had decided sound was worth it. He thought about the moment when Valya had touched the man’s wrist and how gently you could stop a story. He thought about jurisdiction and about how there is the kind that comes from a badge and a paycheck and the kind you earn from staying, and the kind you make for yourself out of the parts nobody thinks to inventory. He thought about how some people are given invisibility by the world and turn it into stealth, and some turn it into prayer, and some turn it into the kind of sadness that sits down and refuses to move. He hoped, against what he knew about hope’s appetite, that the woman who had filed her teeth down would choose a better use for being unseen than the world was willing to give her. He rowed in a line that curved anyway because water lies and you love it anyway, so you adjust and adjust and call it a straight course.

By the end of that week there were fewer close-ups on the group, not because she had stopped seeing hands but because she had started learning to step into rooms instead of around them. She asked twice more and accepted a no twice more and did not get stronger or weaker but different—whatever the muscle is that lets you live with refusal changed shape. Once, in a cafeteria with tomato soup that came from a box and then from a pot and then from a ladle, she asked an older man whose hands were mapped with veins and nurse’s carefulness and who wore around his neck a stethoscope that was not an ornament. He said yes in a voice that sounded like a field in wind. He said, “I’ve been meaning to admire these old things,” and lifted his thumbs and laughed with embarrassment at himself, and his laugh was a bridge built carefully with more nails than necessary. Having been seen, he seemed to sit differently in his chair. She wrote beneath his image, “I asked. He said yes,” and the yes was the size of a plate and she carried it a long way.

There was, of course, a person in an office who had been tasked with deciding whether the presence of a person like Valya was an operational hazard, and that person had a checklist and several boxes and a supervisor who had a meeting about risk reduction at nine. That person printed out the photo of Elena’s consented thumb with its comment thread that had devolved into arguments about art and about the right to not be made into furniture in someone else’s museum. That person wrote a memo in which the phrase “invite to service hub for supportive resources” appeared twice, and the memo went by email to a list that included Humphrey and Miguel and someone with “communications” in their title who came to work every day to move a pile of sand with a spoon. Humphrey read the email and rubbed his forehead with the heel of his hand until there was a small bright galaxy of pressure behind his eyes. He sent a reply that said, “We can try,” and he meant it and he didn’t believe in the words as much as he used to when he was new.

What nobody wrote in a memo was that Valya had begun to pick up litter when she passed it, methodically, like a person who cannot walk by a crying thing without trying to quiet it. She didn’t do it to be seen or because she believed in exchange rates. She did it because she had spent a lot of time around things that had been put down and forgotten, and it is easy for a person to look like that if they are not careful. She bent to take up a water bottle with the label half unrolled and felt the ache across her lower back the way you feel a tooth you haven’t thought about for years when you drink very cold water. She straightened and looked at the sky pressed low and white. She imagined scraping a bit more of her tooth on a rock, just to see if you could remove memory from enamel. She smiled without meaning to, at the ridiculousness of the thought and at the relief of having a choice she did not have to take.

So it went like that for a handful of days that pretended to be ordinary and then weren’t when you looked at them sideways. A man came and yelled at a wall because he had no one else to yell at and the wall looked sturdy. A woman brought in a box of cupcakes with blue frosting that stained the tongue the color of a promise you shouldn’t have made. Humphrey wrote three reports that were all the same and none of them were. Elena slept too hard and woke with the faint print of her own thumbnail on her palm and a dream already walking away. Sita told the story of the wrist to three different people and each time the ending changed by a hair not because she was lying but because the universe inches in small ways and you lose your place if you try to hold it still.

On a Thursday night, the river received a wind that had worked far for its urgency, and it ran faster against the pilings and made a sound that only people who listen to pilings could hear. Valya sat under the bridge with her back to the concrete and her knees up, the phone lit in her palm, and scrolled past faces and hands and the kind of jokes people make when they want to show they are not afraid. She stopped at an image of a thumb with ink on it, purple and dignified, from a place where voting earns you color. She stopped at a picture of a baby’s foot made into a stamp for a birth announcement, and she read the names and tried them on her tongue the way you taste a soup and decide it needs one more thing. Her eyes hurt in that way that screens do not cause but bring to attention. She put the phone face down and the dark returned to full strength. She whispered her own name once out loud because sometimes you need to hear it to keep it from wearing thin. She whispered, “Yes,” to see if the word would climb the pillar and go find a person in a boat and tap him on the temple so he would say it back next time without making you ask.

When the morning came, the lake looked almost embarrassed about the night noise. Humphrey pulled the shell out and slid into the long, clean lie of the stroke. On the bank, the boy was gone and the dog was a different dog with a limp. In the middle distance, a woman stood with a scarf too warm for the temperature and watched without looking like she was watching. He rowed as if the whole business were simple, and then he smiled despite himself, not a grin but the thing his mouth does when the line and the water and the day for a second make the math look solvable. The left oar caught in a way that it only catches when something passes under the surface that might be a fish and might be the shadow of his own boat delayed. He let it go, then picked it up again, and the movement felt like acknowledgment. The morning entered him the way mornings do when they have brought you a problem you know how to work on, even if you suspect it has no end. He would go to Memorial and then to Adventist and then to Mercy Southwest and then to a desk where someone would ask him how he plans to close this, and he would say, “We’re not closing it,” and they would grimace and call him a poet when they meant unhelpful, and he would nod and let them be partly right.

The city, for its part, did not move except in the thousand incremental ways that people who love it notice without bragging. A new citrus tree went into a yard where an old one had gone tired. A man painted over a tag and then tagged his own name smaller and neater in a corner because you have to leave yourself a way to be known in a world that cannot keep everyone’s yellow umbrellas straight. A woman in a scarf took a picture of a thumb after asking, and then another when asked, and then sat with both hands empty for a long time as if she were waiting for an idea to land and did not want to scare it with motion. And in a small room with a window that looked like it let in more light than it did, a detective with a boat-shaped back wrote steady on paper and then stopped and looked up, and for a full minute the sound in the room gathered itself and went somewhere else to bother somebody else, and he breathed in a peace so slight no one but him would have called it that.The day they put the chairs out at the service hub, the light came through the high windows and fell in long bones across the floor, and everyone who walked into those bones hesitated like deer at a creek. The building had been a furniture store once and then a call center and then an empty box with rumors in it. Now it had a corkboard that held messages written with thick markers and earnestness, a coffee pot that smelled like pennies and kindness, a back room full of donated coats that remembered other shoulders. The sign on the door called it a Resource and Recovery Center and someone had underlined the and three times, as if conjunctions were the place where help lived. Humphrey stood under a poster telling people to wash their hands the right way and tried to ignore the part of his brain that had decided this room, too, had never noticed him. Someone with a clipboard looked at him, looked at his badge, looked at the space his badge made, and checked a box. He felt grateful and ridiculous for the gratitude.

Miguel was there with his pillar’s body in a softer shirt that made him look like a citizen instead of a fortress, and he had a man with him from risk management who had brought the kind of smile that says it knows it is borrowed. A woman named Dahlia ran the place with a voice like an old record—warm, a little scratchy at the edges, something you lean in to hear better. She had seen more versions of falling than she cared to count and also more versions of standing back up. She said “we” and meant it more than most. Humphrey liked her immediately for reasons that made him suspicious of his own liking. He told her about a woman who took pictures of thumbs, and instead of making the face that everyone else made, she tilted her head as if listening to a piece of music that other people thought was just noise.

“We can invite,” she said, and wrote a name in her book, and the way she wrote the name made it into a thing with a contour. “If she doesn’t come, that’s not a no,” she added, and he appreciated the grammar of mercy. He went outside and lifted his phone and for a moment watched the parking lot traffic the way other men watch river flow, then texted the number he had no promise would work. The message was short, a door left slightly open. Your name was given to a place that has rooms. No one has to say a word you don’t want. Coffee is better than most. I could be there. He put his phone away because watching a blank screen is a way of impatiently visiting your future.

Valya received the text standing by a fence where roses tried despite the heat. The message arrived like a small animal that wants to be in your pocket and doesn’t know what your pockets are for. She read each word until the words dissolved and became shape. Rooms. Better. There. She ran her tongue against the smoothed edge of that one lower tooth and tasted the ghost of the winter rock. The place in her that had braced for no could not decide whether to be insulted by the absence of it. She wrote back, one word at a time, then deleted, then returned to the first word because it was truer than the others. I am frightened, she typed, and then thought of how that sentence would look on a screen in a stranger’s hand. She erased frightened and wrote shy. Then she erased shy because shy and frightened were cousins and both were too much truth to give a man who would do his best not to keep it. She sent: I will come. And then, because she had learned to round the edges of a hard thing, she sent: Maybe.

She sat under the bridge until the traffic made its low sea above her and tried to remember being unafraid of interiors. Years ago, or last week, she had walked into a church when the sign was not lit and the door had given as if it had been waiting for her specifically. She had sat in the back and watched the way prayer moves a body like wind moves a field: you think it’s nothing until the whole acre bends. Someone had said welcome, and she had believed it for as long as the word hung in the warm air between the pews. After, she went to a meal in a basement where the spaghetti tasted like a decision you make because you deserve to be full. She had been told about forms there, too, and about a man who could help with housing, and the man had shaken his head when he saw her teeth despite the scarf and the way her shoes confessed nothing. She had not returned. The word welcome is a seed, but some soil is tired from being lied to.

On the ward, Elena tried to practice the discipline of not thinking about things that did not need thinking about right that second, because if you haul everything up out of the mental basement every hour you become your own clutter. Morning, meds, vitals, notes, a family with the kind of questions that are really a thin coverlet for fear. Charting went better when she didn’t look directly at the hand that had a new kind of fame in a corner of the internet she would starve if she counted on it for food. At the end of her shift, she took a gel pen from a drawer where office supplies go to become contraband and painted a tiny blue dot at the center of the half-moon of her right thumbnail. She couldn’t say why. It looked like an eye. It looked like a target. It looked like a planet. Sita laughed and said it was a charm against the evil of parking lots, and Elena said, fine, then, yes, and they walked out together, the air making its usual bluff about cool and failing as always after ten o’clock in a valley that holds heat the way memories hold names.

People had begun to talk about the group page at the nurses’ station the way people talk about an odd neighbor. Someone had posted a link to a column that called it outsider art and included the phrase “the edgelands of care,” and one aide said, out loud, “Whatever, that’s a hand,” in a way that made the ridiculous elevation of the ordinary feel like an insult. Someone else had posted a warning: be careful, she is still out there. The language of out there struck Elena as both silly and accurate. Most dangers are less a place than a distance. She scrolled, against her own advice, down into the comments and found a slow-cooking argument about permission that burned at the edges but never boiled away. When Valya’s new post went up—Permission, El—it sat there like a small lamp in a room with too much furniture. Some people mistook it for a flare. Some people mistook it for a threat. A few wrote hearts not because hearts were deep but because sometimes an instrument with one note is all you can carry down the stairs in a hurry.

The man from risk management walked alongside Humphrey as if physics asked him to. He spoke in paragraphs and wore shirts that had been ironed so well they had forgotten how to wrinkle. He said the word liability twice before they reached the end of the hallway and then seemed to realize he had said it within hearing of a woman who had just lost the rhythm of her breath for five long seconds and had to get it back without panic, and he put the word away like a knife presented in poor taste. “We can’t have her on property if—” he began, and left the if to stand in the air like a pillar that held up an invisible balcony. “Agreed,” Humphrey said, and didn’t say that they had had plenty of things on property that had been worse. He didn’t say: men in jackets that try to become doors. He didn’t say: sorrow like fog. He said, “Let me talk to her,” and felt the odd relief of a small job that might be possible.

He went to the bridge and the roses and the corner by the two veterinary offices and the place where the railroad’s back hissed and none of those places held her. He drove past the diner with the syrup born under another flag and saw through the glass a handful of thumbs around cups, some smooth, some with moons, some with tiny storms in a corner of pink. He went to the service hub at the hour people arrive who have made a decision to wash their hair and sit in a chair and try. Dahlia nodded him into her office, which had a window that had never, in its entire life, opened. “She won’t come because you are here,” Dahlia said. “She’ll come because the air feels different in here, and because we put out cups that match.” Humphrey wanted to argue about his own harmlessness and also laugh at himself for wanting to argue. He sat in a chair that had been donated by a family whose children were grown and had a dent from a life of television. Dahlia continued without asking for his permission to be right. “If she doesn’t come today, she will come a day when whatever is chasing her is tired and she looks down and sees we have a box of granola bars and thinks that means we thought about the part of her that gets hungry.”

Valya came late enough that the room’s conversations had already found their lanes. She stood at the door and the air moved over her like a dog trying to decide if it knows you. She could smell the coffee that wanted to forgive you for something and the sugar in the sparkly cereal that someone had poured into a bowl for the purposes of a sign: breakfast all day. She could smell paper and warm plastic and the citrus cleaner at such a distance it seemed like the memory of a lemon. The woman who ran the place saw her and did not do the thing people do when they’ve been waiting, which is to stare as if they could hold you to your shape by attention. She looked and looked away. Valya took that for a kindness and marked it down in the ledger where you write the small yeses as if they are beads you can thread into a rope.

A young man with a neck tattoo in the shape of a feather came up to offer her a clipboard and stopped just short of the edge of her shadow because some instincts survive even when training buries them in bullet points. “You don’t have to fill it out first,” he said. “You can sit and then decide if paper is a thing you feel like arguing with today.” She liked him because he knew the language of truce. She took the clipboard anyway, because taking it disguised her hands, and sat in a chair that put her face across from a picture of a mountain lake blown up out of proportion, so that if you looked hard you could see the pixels like a quilt. Humphrey came out from behind a pillar of pamphlets and made his face do the thing he hoped looked like not crowding. He said her name quietly even though he did not know whether he should be allowed to keep it. She inclined her head because ignoring him would have felt like stepping on a bridge plank just to hear it break.

“We can make arrangements,” Dahlia said calmly into the place where options go to die. “If being here is not it, we can make a different here.” She used a voice that had persuaded a man on a sidewalk to consider putting down his fury long enough to eat noodles. She used a voice that had outlasted more than one high wind. Valya could feel the cords under the voice, the muscles that had learned to hold and release. “Do you do filing,” Valya asked abruptly, and then touched her teeth with her tongue as if she could smooth the bluntness of the question. “I used to file. I filed,” she added, which wasn’t true in the way that had to do with steel cabinets, but was true in another sense, because taking a rough thing and making it a different shape is a kind of filing and a person should be able to put that on a resume without having to explain the river. Dahlia did not blink. “We sort,” she said. “We make order out of piles.” She gestured toward a corner where donated socks have their own kingdom. “And we have a computer class where the password is always the same and nobody laughs if you type like a pianist with bands on two fingers.” It was a small joke. It was sufficient. Valya laughed once, a low sound that made a loose string in Humphrey’s chest pull taut and then relax.

A man at a table across the room said the word hope sarcastically and threw his hands up, and the motion sent his plastic cup scattering ice like teeth across a floor. Three people bent to pick up at once and knocked elbows and somehow it didn’t turn into anything else. A woman with a braid so heavy it could have anchored a rowboat gave up her chair to an old man who wanted to look out the window at nothing. The room exhaled and inhaled. Dahlia walked away on purpose, which was the right move, and the rightness of it made Valya feel something like trust which she recognized only because she had lived so long without it.

“Is this where you want me to be,” she said to Humphrey, and the you and the be landed on the table like objects outside their sentences, and he did not say yes, not because he had learned that lesson at last, but because he could feel that the word would mean something heavier than what his mouth had bandwidth for. “I want there to be a place you can stand and not be asked to disappear,” he said. “It might be here. If it isn’t, I will stand somewhere else with you until we find it. I don’t like to be in the same place as forms any more than you do.”

She frowned in concentration the way you do when trying to read a person’s handwriting that keeps wandering between careful and rushed. She tapped the pen against the top of the clipboard, a rhythm that belonged to a language older than her current body. Then she stilled her hand, and in the silence he could hear the elevator’s bird-throat from a hospital across town, which made no sense and made the kind of sense that trouble makes when it visits two places at once. Someone put a plate of cookies on the table to her left and the smell that rose was the real kind, butter and vanilla and the heat that changes one thing into another and refuses to go backwards. “I am allowed to touch things here,” she said, not without irony. “They will not spray the place after me leave.” Humphrey made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been the recognition of a particular cruelty that every building has perpetrated on someone without noticing.

She stayed long enough to learn the shape of the bathroom door and the way the faucet sometimes sticks and the places where the light gets confused by the high windows and casts a trapezoid where a rectangle seems called for. She folded socks into pairs with speed and patience, as if this were the work of a priest. She listened to a computer’s fan confess its fatigue and learned a password that was indeed the same for everyone. She typed her name into a box that asked for it and pressed Return. The box asked again because it wanted to be sure of her, and instead of taking this as an insult she took it as a ritual, a second blessing. When she walked out, Humphrey was there and not there in the way he has been lately, as if the skin of the afternoon had bubbled and he had been pressed between it and the world. “You are different here,” she said without accusation. “The door makes you thicker.” He wanted to say he had always been like this and had only recently found out, but he let the sentence sit where she had set it.

Miguel called him that afternoon to say the security people had a paper for him to deliver, which was one of those insults that bureaucracies love: the messenger asked to hand over a message he didn’t write and didn’t agree with. “We can’t have her on campus,” Miguel said, and the word campus made Humphrey think of green grass with sprinklers and a building with pillars and a young man learning to argue in an expensive chair, and he felt a small tide of anger without a shore to break on. “I know who she is,” Miguel added, surprising himself. “I mean it. I know more than I want to know about the reason a person might do a strange thing in order to measure themselves. But I have to tell you what the general counsel told me to tell you.” Humphrey took the paper because sometimes a piece of paper is a kind of weather you can’t not walk under. He folded it twice and put it in his jacket, where it rode like a bruise.

He didn’t take it to her that day. He went to Memorial and leaned against a wall that someone had painted intentionally the color of calm. He watched how the doors shuddered when a gurney passed and how the air wanted to go with passengers on the way out because exit doors are always a little dramatic. He let his eyes land on hands as if he were wearing her eyes for practice: the way an old man hooked his thumb into his waistband while listening to a doctor like a cowboy deciding whether a storm merits saddling up, the way a girl with a stuffed frog tucked under her armpit drummed her nails on the frog’s head and made a sound like rain, the way a surgeon-to-be used both thumbs to zoom into a scan as if he could press anatomy into confession. The world, when watched by the part of him that had begun to watch thumbs, looked more tender and more ridiculous than it had before. He didn’t like the thought and liked it very much.

That night, someone set off fireworks far enough away from the river that the river didn’t have an opinion about it. The sound stepped over the neighborhoods in fours. Sita held her niece on the porch and told her that sometimes the loud is for celebration and sometimes it is for testifying and sometimes it is just a man being a fool with a lighter and not enough patience. Elena texted Valya because she had nearly typed it into a comment and then thought better of littering a feed with the kind of sentences that make people more certain of their uncertainties. She typed: I can teach you to paint your own nails if you want. She deleted want because it sounded like want. She sent it anyway, and the three dots that tell you a person is thinking appeared and then disappeared like birds who change their minds halfway to the park. Valya wrote back: Not the nails. Maybe the skin around. It gets hooks and they catch on cloth. The practicality of the answer made Elena feel something like relief, as when a dream decides to be useful instead of strange. She sent: Bring your hand. I have a file. They both laughed in their separate rooms, at the obviousness of that word laid bare.

News did what news does: it found a way to be the story and not the story. A station ran a segment about the nurses being watched by a stranger who might be dangerous and they used a photo of a hand that wasn’t from the group at all, a hand that belonged to a stock photo of hands shaking. A newscaster with a voice perfectly mated to his hair said police had no suspects and then said they had talked to one person of interest and worth. The words drifted over the evening meal in three dozen houses that ate on the couch and landed with the weight of lint. In one house a man said, “What’s the big deal, it’s just a picture,” and his wife said, “It’s the taking,” and he said, “Ain’t that what you call… art?” and she said, “No, that’s what you call a theft that doesn’t know it took something.” In another house a girl taking prerequisites for nursing school looked at her own thumbs and thought, do I like them, and decided that liking was a luxury you reserve for later, which is true and also a cheat.

Humphrey went to the flyer board and found someone had tacked a new notice over the rowing club announcement. It said, in small careful letters, WALK IN PAIRS, not because you are weak but because that is how wolves travel. He touched the corner of the paper and felt the oil from the thumb that had pressed it there. He thought he recognized the slope of the nail bed. He smiled. He reached for the edge of his jacket and felt the folded paper with the trespass warning like a splinter under a fingernail and decided, ruthlessly, to become the kind of man who misplaces important papers for a day or two. He didn’t tear it up. He put it behind the flyer for a blood drive and kept walking.

Valya met Elena on a bench near the memorial garden where a bronze plaque had lost a letter and now commemorated the way names decay. The bench was sun-bleached and the shade line moved across it like a decision that couldn’t make up its mind. Elena took out a small implement kit with the seriousness of a surgeon uncasing instruments. She had bandage scissors and a thin glass file and a little bottle that smelled like flowers that grow on vines. She took Valya’s right hand in her lap and held it like a hand and not like a specimen. The gloves came off. The nails beneath were as she had said and as everyone had always said: wide and thick and enamel bright, a geometry stubbornly not human and yet indisputable in its own logic. Elena didn’t flinch, and the not flinching did more than nurses’ training can account for. She worked at the skin instead, at the hangnails that snagged, at the ragged places that made a person bleed for nothing. She filed with a gentleness that seemed inappropriate to an object and exactly suited to a person.

“My mother used to do this to me when I was little and bit my nails,” Elena said, because you tell stories when you have a lap-full of someone else’s hand. “She’d say, you can chew at yourself or you can be tended. Choose.” She blew a whisper of dust from the side of Valya’s thumb. “I chew,” Valya said, as if confessing to an old church that has heard worse many times. “The day is made of things you chew and things you swallow whole,” Elena said, surprising herself again. “I try to chew what I can. The swallowing goes wrong otherwise.” Behind them, the fern made the sound ferns make when they’re trying to pretend they are trees.

Humphrey stood at the entrance, not all the way in and not all the way out, and watched the two women in the kind of light that presses its cheek against your shoulder and waits to be acknowledged. If a person could choose the weather for a memory, he would choose this. He had the unhelpful thought that if he walked forward, the air would forget to wrap around him and he would become the kind of absence that leaves a draft. He took one step anyway. The draft did not come. Elena looked up and gave him a nod that included him in a room that had no walls, and he didn’t realize until then that he had been braced for the usual trick of the world. He moved closer and did not clear his throat, which is a victory for some people.

“The service place had cookies,” Valya said, as if reporting on a crime of intention. “And a woman with a braid like a rope.” “Dahlia,” Humphrey said, without making her into anything she had not said she was. “You can go there when I am not there,” he offered. “I got an email from a person who writes memos that says I should tell you not to come here,” he added, because he had decided to try the experiment of saying things in the order their weight demanded. He held out his hands in a gesture that was not apology and not surrender but a third thing that only exists when people practice it. “I won’t hand it to you like a punishment,” he said. “If you want to read the thing someone wrote about you who doesn’t know you, I’ll bring it tomorrow and you can rip it and we can make confetti and throw it at the river,” Elena suggested, dryly. “But you don’t have to take their paper into your day if you don’t want to.” Valya looked from one face to the other, assessed and considered and decided. “Bring it,” she said. “Paper is a kind of animal. It shouldn’t be wasted. We can use it to line a drawer where small things get lost.” The logic was perfect enough to make both of them laugh.

On the way back to the station, Humphrey saw a boy on a bicycle throw his hand up in a greeting that did not belong to anyone and realized the boy was waving at the version of him that appears when the light is behind him, the outline you could hang a coat on. He waved back and the boy whooped and pedaled harder. The world is not gentle in its explanations, but sometimes it is generous with its shorthand. He parked in the wrong place on purpose and went inside and filled out a form that asked for numbers and delivered no relief. He opened a drawer and took out the pack of index cards he used for storing the parts of a case that change shape too often to be digital. On one he wrote: cookies, socks, braid, blue dot, wrist. On another he wrote: lemon, dirt, river. He looked at the stack and felt foolish and also steadied. You put down the marks you can, you learn to live with the gaps.

It wasn’t neat. It never is. A man came into the emergency room with a story about being followed that he had made up out of threadbare shame and the nurse who triaged him didn’t have enough quiet to untangle it so she took his stats and put him in a chair and hoped someone upstream had the patience to try again. A woman sat in her car and stared at her own knuckles on the wheel for a long time because she felt outside herself in a way that asked for a witness, and no one appeared except a shadow of a tall man in a rearview mirror who may have been a trick of the glass. The group’s admin posted a note asking for kindness and was told by strangers he had never met that he was a censor and a coward and a chill, which made him laugh and walk his dog with a kindness that had nothing to do with digital weather. Sita told a patient a bedtime story about a mountain that remembered it could move, and the patient slept for twenty minutes straight in a room that had not held twenty consecutive quiet minutes since the new memo about call lights had gone up.

Under the bridge, the graffiti had acquired a new line in a smaller hand: WE WERE HERE, and below it, in different chalk, I AM TRYING. Valya’s phone battery died the second she wanted to take a picture of it, which felt like prevention by a hand she was not sure she had earned. She sat with her back to the pillar and watched her own breath push out a little dust from a crack in the concrete, as if the ground were sighing. The river did what it does when no one is looking and what it does when everyone is: it went. She held the paper Humphrey had brought the next day between two fingers and felt the weight for what it was, not much, and folded it until it became a square small enough to make into a corner-prop for her album of yeses, tucked into the pocket with the others, ready to keep a page from lifting up and lying about the order of things. The moon came up, a nail half painted, and for the first time in a long time she slept before she meant to, mouth open, jaw slack, a creature with nothing to guard for six whole breaths in a row.

In the morning, the lake met him like an old argument they had both agreed to have again without meanness. Humphrey rowed the length of it, the catch and the drive and the lift like writing sentences he had practiced until his hand couldn’t lie. Halfway down, he let the oars rest and drifted. The silence gathered the way silence gathers when it is full of other silences. He thought of the flyers and the hands and the small blunt tools we make into meaning. He thought of the line between watching and witnessing. He thought of whether a person who has learned to disappear can be convinced to share a little of the burden of being seen. He didn’t pray. He said names under his breath like a list you take out of your pocket and handle so you don’t lose it. The boat slid on a surface that in another light would have been a mirror. A goose lifted its head and considered him and then, apparently deciding he was to be tolerated, lowered it again. He smiled without realizing and the smile might have been a surrender and might have been a start.The light that found the city that week came thin and apologetic, as if it had had to ask permission from a thicker dark before it could proceed. In his kitchen that had one plant always on the edge of survival, Humphrey stood with a mug cooling in his hand and felt that pull behind the eyes that means the world has altered a fraction and is waiting to see if you notice. He had woken too early and then, not trusting the early hour to hold him, stayed upright until the clock consented to agree. He read the memo about a “town hall” with hospital staff and a deputy city attorney whose specialty changed depending on who was asking, and he imagined rows of chairs, the way chairs arranged themselves for events that promise explanation and deliver only the white noise of process. He meant to go anyway, because there is a part of him that cannot abide a room where fear is given the microphone and no one with a working voice stands up to argue back in even tones.

At the service hub, Valya learned where the tape lived and how it tore best if you caught it at the edge with a fingernail and folded it back on itself so the track began again. Dahlia showed her the volunteer shelf with lanyards and clip-on badges that had the tender authority of labels that have not yet been lied to. “You don’t have to wear it,” Dahlia said, and said it in a way that suggested she knew what the weight of a name around the neck can do to a spine. “But if you want to rearrange the coat corner, it’s nice if people can call you by something you’ll answer to.” Valya touched a lanyard and then touched the skin of her throat as if that spot needed warning. She took it and slid it into her pocket where it thumped gently as she walked, a tame animal that would not be taken out in public until she was ready to introduce it.

It was Dahlia’s idea to put up a long paper and call it a wall, not because the building needed a wall but because people do. “What if we ask the ones who want to be asked to bring a handprint or a photo of their hand or a sentence about what it does all day, and then we make a line of it,” she said, drawing with her finger in the air, leaving an invisible seam that nevertheless held. “We could call it Work of Hands, and it would be a way to remember that none of this runs on magic. Also a way for the people who need to see themselves see themselves without having to stare into a mirror.” Valya lifted her head as if scenting something downwind. The word line had done something inside her, a reliable thing, a quieting of the part that looked for edges to bruise against. “And if someone doesn’t want to,” she asked, plain like a hammer that’s never learned to masquerade. “Then the paper will be their boundary,” Dahlia said, and laughed at her own tidy answer because she knew boundaries were always messier than tape suggests.

The dot on Elena’s thumbnail lasted two days before it chipped, which felt correct in the way that a charm wears as much as it protects. She had been half-way embarrassed the first time three colleagues noticed and said nothing about it too loudly, an alliance of silence as tight as a braid. By shift’s end, Sita had two dots, one blue, one a smear of purple from a pen that had exploded in her pocket. An aide named Cristobal hid a dot under a beige bandage because his supervisor had a new intolerance for adornment and would call it unprofessional. A student who kept crying in bathrooms left a tiny star where the half-moon lived on her left hand, and the act of painting it made her stop crying for a while, which is as much as can be asked of stars at a hospital. Someone took a picture of a clatter of thumbs at a table in a break room and posted it to the group with a caption that read “We know about looking,” and the comments came as they come, half kindness, half the usual small vandalism of strangers. Elena closed her phone and went back to drawing the thin line between overmedicating and not enough, her dot a small planet in her peripheral vision that reminded her that bodies orbit other bodies all day long and somehow do not crash.

The town hall unfolded as predicted and with more chairs. A lawyer in a suit the color of a repeatable sky stood behind a podium and said phrases that had been born and raised in conference rooms. People listened and did not, and the air sagged with the weight of judiciousness. When a nurse stood up and described walking to her car with a set of keys like claws between her fingers because that is what someone once told her to do, there was a murmur that carried more heat than anything else that afternoon. Miguel spoke without speaking for the hospital, a dance he had trained for without knowing that he would ever need it, and when he used the words we and ours he meant his nurses and not the corporation. Humphrey said little. He answered the question about whether anyone had been hurt with a no that felt like a thin dam against a river that would not be fenced if it got its way. He said, “You can call me when you’re scared even if nothing has happened,” and half the room glanced at their own shoes because fear is easier to carry when you pretend you set it down on purpose.

If the jacket man came back, he did so in the way petty men do: from a different angle, with less nerve and more paperwork. He tried to file a complaint about harassment and used the word assault as if it were a hat he could try on in different stores. The clerk at the service window listened as if it mattered and then told him gently that words liked to be used where they belonged. Humphrey watched through glass the exchange happen and reminded himself that some victories are small and belong to other people. He had the trespass notice in his jacket still, softer at the edges now from carrying, and the paper seemed to radiate a kind of impatience that made him think about termites. He wanted to tell the paper to wait its turn. He wanted to give the paper a nap.

In her corner of the hub, Valya learned names in pieces and stored them whole. There was the man with the Shakespearean collar of beard who liked his coffee with powdered creamer because it made him feel like he was doing science. There was a woman whose hair had been everything over the years and was now a brave, practical short, who had once been a receptionist and once a mother and was now deciding whether to be one of those things again. There was a teenager who talked to her like a forest talks to a bird, with small warnings that sounded like compliments. With a pencil that wrote eagerly, she drafted a sign for the wall. It read, in block letters: WHAT YOUR HANDS DO ALL DAY, and underneath in smaller letters: You can draw. You can write. You can cut out pictures from old magazines. You can let someone else write if you want. Ask for tape. She did not sign it, because signatures are one of the places where history sticks to you, and it seemed better to let the room own it.

On the group, a new message appeared under a post of a thumb with a blister where a handle had made its lesson clear. The admin had pinned a note to the top: Consent is not optional. Ask, and accept no. Posts without consent will be removed. This is not a museum of unasked-for. The words sat there like furniture rearranged while you were gone, and the people who tripped over them wrote what people write when they trip. Some unsubscribed loudly. Others stayed and wrote about their own thumbs, thinner than Elena’s, thicker than Sita’s, darker, lighter, with moons that looked like smiles or like distant planets no telescope had claimed. Valya kept her hands off the posts that came without asking, and when she felt the itch in her thumbs to take, she went and sorted the sock bin by colors instead, a pastel quiet that gave the hunger something to do besides break things.

He didn’t mean to go to the care facility, but his car turned in of its own volition, an old trick that memory plays with wheels. His father had moved to a place that smelled like soap that had always lived in institutional bottles and had never in its life been poured into anything rounded. The building had a nice imagined life in its architectural drawings and had settled for something you could forgive if you brought love with you through the door. The man who had taught Humphrey to lift his oar and set it into a pocket without anger was smaller, a gravity story in a chair with a window that offered a view of a hedge that kept the street from knowing these people existed. “You rowing,” his father said, his tongue making the word long as if it needed a runway. “Some,” Humphrey said, and set the cup of coffee near the hand he still recognized by the way the aioli of age refused to disguise an old scar from a factory belt. The staff passed by him with the peculiar deference of people who do not know if the man in the chair has company they need to record. One aide said hello without moving her mouth much, and he mimed hello back and felt that slip of the light again, that shift as if he had walked an inch out of phase. He shifted back, not sure which inch to trust.

By then Elena had started to carry a tiny bottle of oil in her pocket, dime-store fancy, to rub into the hangnail beds of whoever was brave enough to hold still while someone handled their hand. It was a ridiculous and minor sacrament, and it worked more often than it didn’t. “One breath and then another,” she’d say, because the breath keeps time when clocks fail. Sita teased her mercilessly and then offered her own finger with theatrical reluctance, and the two of them at the end of a shift in a supply room that smelled like plastic and bleach and old hope looked, from a certain angle, like women rubbing lotion into a future that had come with chapped edges. In the meditation room that most wards had and most days forgot, they sat one night like two old friends and a stranger hiding in plain sight. Valya had come because Elena had said: If you want a quiet door, this is one. The room did its best to pretend to be a cave, with soft light and a noise machine that was brave about rain. They sat in chairs that tried to keep secrets. They did not take a picture. They breathed until the false calm felt enough like the other kind to be useful.

Security knew about it and did not, because knowledge in buildings travels like weather: it’s there and it isn’t and then suddenly everyone carries an umbrella. The guard who’d had to memorize too many policy words recently saw a shape that could have forced him to step into his role as a wall and did a thing that pleased him later when he was honest: he walked past and pretended to have business with the clipboard, and the pretending became business because paper is needy and always wants to be written on. Humphrey, called to another floor to ease a man out of a loud fit of borrowed righteousness, felt the ripple you feel when the place you are in makes a small adjustment to accommodate kindness, and he chose to trust it. He stood under a sign that told him to report spills immediately and watched his own hand lift the radio to his ear in a motion he had made a thousand times so that his body could do it without him, in case he needed to be invisible for a minute so the world could solve itself without him bothering it.

Risk management called him in with eyes that had watched too much and decided only one thing in the end: keep your job by surviving meetings. The man in the ironed shirt spoke more gently this time and used first names as a bridge he thought sound had built for him. “We need you to deliver that paper, Detective,” he said, and the please was implied by the way he did not use it. “We can’t have exposure.” Humphrey wondered when the word had taken visitors and turned into a thing you measured with money. He held the folded notice in his hand and realized, with a twinge he usually avoided, that he had been building a private case in opposition to the paper’s logic and that cases like that do not get you commendations, they get you a reputation for poetry, and he made a decision he could not unmake: he would deliver it, and he would change it before it reached its destination. He sat at his desk and took out a pen and began to cross out and add notations as if the trespass notice were a homework paper returned for revision, and he made a copy, and then he waited for the minute when the hallway emptied of the kind of eyes that love to report.

The wall in the hub filled fast, because people have been trying to tell their hands’ stories for longer than phones have been able to pretend to be the answer. There were grease-slowed fingers from a man who had worked on cars and now worked on sleeping well enough not to break his own teeth. There was a woman who wrote, in big loops, “I press my knuckles against my grandson’s forehead when he has fever, old trick that never fails,” and her handprint was a cluster of suns. A line from a teenage boy read, “I make beats on my leg with these,” and beneath it a photo of two long brown fingers blurred with the motion only still images sometimes capture. Valya asked before she took any photo, and each yes she collected sat in her slower album like stones she put into a circle to make a fire safe. She wrote words under them, but now they were the words she had been given: “Hector says these are for steering and opening jars no one else can,” “Anita says this one knows the feel of a pulse in three places,” “El says the dot keeps watch.” She stopped captioning with words she didn’t know and started making lists with words shared.

Jo at the desk gave her a look the morning Humphrey hovered with the edited paper folded in his hand. “You look like a man about to wash a cat,” Jo said, which made him laugh just enough to break a tension wire that had been pulling on his ribs. “If you’re going to hand that to her, try not to hand it like you’re handing her a snake,” she added, and sorted her tiny purple envelopes into a stack that would never be as even as she wanted. He went to the hub and found her with tape, fitting a caption under a photograph with the concentration of someone laying tile. He stood in front of the wall until she looked up because looking at the work first seemed like manners. “They asked me to give you something I didn’t agree to,” he said, and he watched her face for the shadow that always comes when the law enters a room as itself. “I changed it. It now says the hospital needs you to ask permission to be on their land unless you’re invited, and if you want to be invited you can be, by me, by Dahlia, by Elena, by Miguel, by… any name we write here on this line.” He showed her the line he had added, and he had put names on it like staking a claim, and left space after because space belongs in these things. She read the paper with a poet’s disdain and a clerk’s practicality. “I am always being asked to stand at someone’s boundary,” she said. “It is good to have a list of people who open gates.”

The first time the light went completely through him it happened in the parking lot where a man argued with a woman with the sincerity of an actor who had not learned his lines and was trying to make the audience believe improvisation was the plan. Humphrey stepped into the triangle of their trouble and spoke the way he had been learning to speak, flat and simple, doors not walls. The woman looked at him, looked at his badge, looked at her own mouth in the reflection of a car window and made a decision to leave the argument in the lot like a coat. The man swore, but his heart wasn’t in it, and he walked away dragging a dignity he had not been able to keep. Humphrey felt a draft and realized it wasn’t the wind but the absence of friction where his shoulder passed the air, and then Jo yelled his name from fifty yards and the sound of his name hit him like a thrown rope. He came back into his own outline as if stepping onto a dock after the boat has drifted, and he shook once, almost invisible, and decided not to write that part down because he didn’t know the form number for it.

Elena took the consented photo of her dot and printed it on the hub’s misbehaving machine and brought it, on her way to a nap that would not negotiate, to the paper wall. She stood with her arm extended, the printed square springing slightly against the glue’s tack, and for a second remembered being a child and holding a line out to a kite that had higher ideas. The caption she wrote under her picture wasn’t a caption; it was a list under the rubric that had grown like moss at the top of that section: What These Do. She wrote: press the pump, sign the notes, lift the chin, measure the quiet, stir soup, buckle Sita’s niece into the car, play pretend piano on the steering wheel, touch a forehead, pick a splinter out, say stop, say go, say yes. She thought it was silly and it made her cry anyway, quickly, in the efficient way she had learned to cry when she needed to clean a thing and move on.

That night the river got into a mood, lapping with the soft impatience of a friend who wants you to go home. Valya sat at the pillar with the chalk words and added a hyphen to the sentence someone else had left there, a small correction that pleased her more than was warranted. I AM TRY-ING, and the dash made the word look truer. The phone in her hand buzzed and buzzed and went quiet, and when she raised it she saw a direct message from the group’s admin with a polite desperation: Would you consider being a moderator? We need to be better at what you already decided you’d do. She smiled at the idea of moderating as if it were a verb you could use on a person. She typed back slowly because moderation in writing is the same work in different clothes. I will try. I will say ask. I will say no without teeth. I will ask to put the hands on a wall you can touch.

He did not wait for an answer to the question he had not asked, not that night. He went to the lake in the morning and the water answered him with that little lift he had come to depend on the way you depend on the one good joke a day. He rowed a piece of himself into the middle and then let the boat drift and saw a boy on the shore throwing rocks into a mirror and loving the shatter without knowing why. He thought, not for the first time and now without shame, that if he disappeared it would be by inches and politely, like a man leaving a party by saying goodbye to each person in turn. He did not want to. The wanting not to felt like a good sign. He lifted the oars and dropped them and listened for the click, the soft kiss of wood into metal, that kept arriving after the sound belonged. When he turned his head, there was a woman on the bank wearing a scarf too warm for the already-souring day, and she lifted her palm in a gesture that looked like a blessing and like a joke and like the start of an agreement. He answered with the smallest tilt of his wrist, the old boatman’s salute, and the lake took the shape of it, and for three strokes he felt the resistance that reminded him he was here, in this skin, in this day, called what he was called.

At the ward later, Sita told the other nurses that the woman with the scarf had hands that worked like brakes and that sometimes good brakes are the difference between shouting and harm. She put her own thumb on the wall at the hub after her shift and wrote, “I keep napkins in my purse because somebody always needs one,” and laughed at herself for the easy wisdom of it. She watched Elena sleep crooked on a sofa in a staff room with her badge flipped backward and the blue dot chipped almost entirely away. She thought of painting a dot on the chipped dot and decided no, let some things erase themselves and begin again.

By Friday, someone had brought a camera that wasn’t a phone and had taken pictures of hands holding tools, and the images had a weight that screens do not grant. A mechanic’s grip on a wrench, a teacher’s chalk-stained nail, an old woman’s bunched knuckles on a walker handle that looked like it had been designed by a person who had never met a body. Dahlia wrote labels with a carefulness that showed in the letters’ posture. In the corner of the wall where early pieces live, the first print, Elena’s thumb with its dot faded but present, sat with its list like a prayer that didn’t mind being overheard. Life came and went in the hub the way it does in any place that dares to offer a chair and a table and two cups. Humphrey stood and tried to count how many minutes it would take for a person who walked in off the street to be given a thing with weight: a granola bar, a number, a promise, a sentence that holds when the wind starts. He lost count and decided that was the measure, not the failure.

The paper he had altered sat in Valya’s album where she kept proof of what she could hold down. It propped the corner of a page so the photograph didn’t lift and whisper to the others about their shared fate. She felt the tug to fill the album with yeses now that she had witnessed a few, to make a belt of them and wear it the way some people wear bracelets that remind them to breathe. She also felt the older tug, the one that tightened whenever she walked onto a property line, to be too much on purpose so that nobody could accuse her of having tricked them into letting her be. She opened her phone to the group and saw a flood of thumbs with blue dots and purple scribbles and a single green star, and she laughed, low and sudden, at the ridiculousness and the beauty of a hundred small circles of color on businesslike nails. She scrolled and saw a nurse in another county far away write, “I will not be made into a thumb without my permission, but I will show you my thumb when I decide,” and the rhythm of that sentence made her feel a click in her chest like the oar meeting its lock.

There had been a rumor about a wolf seen near the river last winter, an out-of-place story that took on work in the mouths of boys and in the eyes of men who wanted to warn you that the world is dangerous in the old fashioned way. Humphrey thought about that as he walked the corridor with the vending machines and saw his own reflection overlayed on the coils of sugar and salt, man and snack both trapped behind glass. He said his own name out loud, softly, just to keep it, and a janitor pushing a mop looked up and said, with the easy bravado of someone who trusted the building to hold in a storm, “We know you, Hump,” and clapped the mop handle against the floor twice like applause. The day, for once, applauded back in small ways. The machine didn’t eat his dollar. The elevator came when he pressed the button without remembering who he was. The light that found him was not thin at all. It sat on his shoulder and waited, happy to be kept.Chapter 8

The week turned brittle with a kind of heat that felt less like temperature and more like a rule. The parking lot shimmered as if the asphalt were full of fish, and people walked across it with the grace of those who have made a truce with glare. Inside, air-conditioning grumbled along the ducts and then, just after noon on a Tuesday, the whole building inhaled and forgot how to exhale. Lights thinned, stumbled, and then returned in a rattle that made the machines speak in error codes as if they had been startled mid-sentence. The red EXIT signs held steady, smug in their battery-backed convictions. Somewhere a generator coughed and settled into its squat duty. Nurses paused, counted, and moved again, redistributing care by an old choreography: those whose rooms could do without monitors for a few minutes relinquished them to the wards where constant watching is not a luxury. It was the kind of small crisis that hospitals practice for and survive by folding the unusual into the same movements that get them through Tuesday.

Humphrey was in the stairwell because the elevator and he had developed a wary pact and because stairs are honest. He felt the moment before the lights went because his skin went first. The stairwell dimmed and deepened, the cinderblock landing suddenly a stage that remembered a missing actor, and he put his hand on the rail and steadied himself as if the building were a boat with a mind to turn. An intern clutching a chart rounded the bend and stopped dead when the fluorescents stuttered. For a second her face made that naked theatre of calculation—Do I run? Do I cry? Do I become a person who makes jokes when the lights go out?—and then she saw him as if biology had handed her a handhold. “Is this normal,” she asked, and the word normal broke in half and flipped like a coin in the stairwell. “It is Tuesday,” he said, which was the answer he had started to give to most questions that demanded more certainty than he owned. He stood there not as an authority but as mass, a person-shaped post to tie a line around, and what he offered was not much and exactly enough, because the intern breathed and moved again, and her shoes made that particular school squeak that announces a person still learning to step.

On the second landing, a shape waited in the shadow where a fire hose once had a glass case, and when the generator growled itself awake the shape became a woman in a scarf, her eyes calm and interested, like a witness waiting to see what kind of trick the world thought it was about to pull. Valya had stepped into the stairwell the instant the lights dipped, not toward anything but away from the hot white of the vendor hallway that made her want to flinch. Darkness had pressed around her like an old friend with bad timing. When the lights returned, she stayed because habit had taught her to make use of the second beat after a surprise. She looked at the intern and then at the man, and when the intern passed she shifted aside with a precision you could measure. The scarf had slid lower because sweat makes fabric disobedient. Her mouth showed. Her teeth, blunt and filed and stubbornly themselves, took the light and threw it back without apology. Humphrey did not look away, and it felt like an accomplishment he did not deserve and would not name out loud. The stairwell hummed; it always had. Today the hum carried the sound of an engine telling the building that the rules apply to other failures, not to this one.

The wall at the hub had ripened. Where there had been blank paper and an idea there was now an archive you could touch with the same caution you bring to a sleeping baby’s hair. Handprints layered like leaves in a river; labels sprouted below photographs like roots. A man with a carpenter’s pencil had drawn a line of the callus that sat like country along the base of his thumb and written: roofing season. A woman with a lunch counter job mapped the way a hundred cups a day make a groove, the way repetition becomes geography. A girl brought in her grandmother’s thimble and pinned it to the corner with string. Someone wrote, “I count pills and try not to count losses,” and someone else wrote, “I count change without rolling my eyes,” and the proximity of the two sentences made an accidental poem that people stopped and petted with their eyes like a dog in a hallway.

Dahlia roped off an afternoon with string and tape and called it an opening because naming events makes them work. She borrowed a speaker that made announcements sound like music and music sound like announcements, and she made a pot of coffee that forgave everyone for not remembering her restrictions, and she said, out loud to the room that had enough chairs to look official without looking sad, “This is not a gallery. This is an atlas.” The crowd was not a crowd—people came in and out as if the door were a tide—but they stood and listened and did that thing rooms do when something is named well: they settled around the words like spoons in a drawer. Elena brought Sita and leaned, with the permission of a long day, against a pillar that had never been asked to hold anything meaningful and was pleased by the assignment. Miguel showed up wearing a shirt with a tiny flamingo pattern and an expression like an apology he couldn’t quite make, and the look dissolved when he saw his own hand—because someone had made him put it in paint and press, and he had rolled his eyes and then done it again with his palm because the first one had air pockets—and he grinned with a boyishness his staff saw and filed away under: good.

On the group, moderation became a verb with weight. The admin sent a message like a white flag and an invitation: we need help steering this thing you built by accident. Valya accepted. Her first acts were small and sharp: she took down three posts that had the stench of pride and nothing else; she pinned a sentence that said, “Ask. Then wait as long as you need. If the answer is no, thank them for saving you time.” She wrote it in her slow English and then asked the admin to write it again in his quick, and they left both, a two-language road sign that neither of them thought was complete. She wrote to one man who had posted a picture of a hand across a steering wheel with the caption hottie, and said, gently, “We are not that kind of hungry here.” He wrote back four texts in a row, long on insult and short on invention, and she muted him because there are kinds of conversation that do not need to be fed. She wondered what kind of filing it would take to separate want into useful piles and decided it would require a room larger than this city.

Risk management, perhaps roused by the idea of fun happening without them, printed signs in red. NO PHOTOGRAPHY WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. Miguel held one and sighed the sigh of a man who has had to become fluent in a dialect of trying. He stapled one sign low enough for children to read and another high enough to hit the eye of a person who had learned to keep their head down, and he told his staff what he had to say because the way a thing is said matters to the person saying it. “Let’s not give anyone an excuse to punish us for being human,” he said. Elena nodded because the sentence belonged on both sides of a door. She went on break and drew a blue dot again on her thumbnail because rituals can be ridiculous and necessary. She swung past the hub with Sita at her shoulder and a bag of cookies that had not survived the trip intact. They stood with their own images and didn’t pose, which felt like a new discipline: to be reflected without working at it.

That afternoon brought a different kind of irritant, the sort of thing that grows like mold wherever attention accumulates. Someone had started an account that looked and sounded like a cousin of the Hands group and wasn’t. It took nurses’ photos, faces out of context, and poured them into a feed with captions that made intimacies out of nothing and then claimed it had only been joking. Humphrey set his jaw and let his thumb do the work across the phone screen, hunting the little holes where anonymity often drips. The IP trail ran through a teenager’s game console, then through an uncle’s Wi-Fi, then back to a laptop with a cracked hinge that had been left open on a carpet in an apartment with five toothbrushes in one glass. He knocked on a door that had been banged so many times it had learned not to anticipate. A boy looked out with a face that tried on five expressions in quick succession and found none that fit. The boy was not a predator; he was a kid trying to look powerful without any of the accessories. Humphrey felt the tug to become thunder and chose a different register because he’d seen thunder’s shelf life. “Do you know what it feels like to have someone decide you are one part of your body and not the rest,” he asked, and that question had more effect than any mention of charges. The boy, who had watched a sister cry over a snapshot taken at a bus stop, reddened and shuffled and took the account down in a flurry of apologies that did not know where to land. Humphrey left the apartment with his hands empty and felt as if he had carried something anyway.

At the river that night, the wind went wise and then lazy, and the bridge’s pillars shed heat like old men telling stories they didn’t finish. Valya sat with her album and her folded papers that served as anchors. Her mind slid to the winter she had given a river her enamel. It had been a long season, white not like purity but like blindness. She had found the rock because a log had overturned it, revealing a face that begged for use. The first scrape had been the worst, and then the pain turned coaxing. She had filed away the part that told the world what it thought it saw, and the filing had made a new map on her own tongue. She had learned then that to remove one thing is to make space for another, and that the city had rooms you could live in for a day without anyone naming your edges. When she put the phone on her thigh and kept her hands free, she felt the ghost of the rock and forgave herself again for the way you solve a problem with a tool that looks like the problem.

Dahlia sat with her in the late light of the hub as chairs began to drift toward corners and a woman with parentheses for laugh lines counted the day’s forks. “I had a son once who thought his hands were useless,” Dahlia said, because sometimes stories do not ask permission from the teller either. “He said they only knew two things, and neither of them pays rent. One was coddling a guitar and one was finding veins where the arms have given up. He was wrong about the paying. He was also wrong about what hands are for. We spoke about it and then we did not get to speak about it anymore. The day I learned not to hate his hands I learned to stop hating every hand I pass that is trying not to shake.” Valya listened with the discipline you give to a voice leaning away from itself. She held out her own hand and let Dahlia oil the torn parts around the nails with a tenderness that made the day lift for a second like a table on a ship. They did not cry; they adjusted in their chairs and allowed silence to unfold its one party trick, which is to hold.

In the hospital chapel that smelled like dust, water, and unspecific faith, Elena and Sita sat with a family that had learned the hard lesson about how good news can be a narrow hallway you have to turn sideways to pass. They held a chain of hands, child to aunt to nurse to nurse, and the chain wasn’t magic but it did something—a redistribution of the body’s argument with itself. Elena’s blue dot pulsed in her periphery. She thought, not for the first time, that maybe all those holy pictures with halos have been misunderstood; maybe the artists had just been painting the sensation of being looked at with mercy. Later, she scrubbed out at a sink with a handle that sprayed and a soap that took no prisoners, and she pressed her thumb into her palm hard enough to see the lunula pale. The hand remembered how to settle. She dried and went back out and told the mother gently that the reason nurses work in pairs at night is because pairs save time, and the mother nodded as if somebody had said something useful at last.

The trespass notice became a legend by accident because that is how legends prefer to be born. Jo told a version in the smoking corner about a piece of paper that had grown more names than warnings and had decided its job wasn’t to bar a door but to list the people who knew how to open it. Miguel told his staff the hospital lawyers had been surprised by the way the building bent toward ordinary decency when nobody looked, and risk management learned to write emails with fewer capitals and more commas. Humphrey kept the second copy of the altered notice under the in-box in his desk, where paper goes to dream of being important, and he used it as a mat for his index cards, the way an old memo becomes one more layer of meaning under the new.

The day the TV camera showed up at the hub, everybody confused politeness with strategy. The reporter had hair that said he valued his time, and he positioned himself in front of the wall with a practiced angle that would show hands but not the cheap outlet at floor level that had a scorch mark like a small comet. “We’re here at a space where the community is doing something kind of extraordinary,” he said into the camera with the steady enthusiasm of a man who likes his job enough not to sneer, and Dahlia let him because sometimes you let a room be named by someone who does not know it well but means well enough. Valya stood three chairs back and watched her own work corrected by a lens, and felt the anger that cameras on other days had raised and felt a different thing as well, an amusement that was almost forgiveness. The reporter asked if they could talk to the woman who had changed a group and then refused to call what she had done change. Dahlia said, “You can talk to the board,” and the reporter laughed and did as he was told, which made him better than most.

Humphrey did not appear on camera because the camera did not like him and the feeling had become mutual. He stood by the coffee and drank a cup that had learned to be good by living in this building, and he listened while a volunteer with a braid told the reporter that hands are the part of you that keep committing even when you are tired. He thought about three incident reports on his desk and about the boy with the console and about his father’s scar, and in his brain a line formed that had nothing to do with a case and everything to do with a fact: the work that made the city livable was smaller than the stories about it and heavier. He let the thought sit without trying to comb it.

Mornings at the lake went through a brief temper. Wind blew from two directions and nobody called it indecision except the geese, who voiced a complaint in the guttural register that sounds like a grandmother clearing her throat. The shell lifted and set and lifted and set, and Humphrey’s back remembered the argument and let it be a conversation. He passed a man teaching a boy to cast for the first time, patience bundled into the gentle correction of a wrist. He passed a woman walking into her head, steps metronomic, jaw working a song no one else would know. In the far corner of the water where the reeds make an opinion about the shore, a coyote stood with its sleek daylight caution and watched the stroke count for a while before it decided the human had nothing to spoil and went on its way. Humphrey drifted longer than he meant to. When he turned, there was a figure on the bank under a scarf that today had the color of learned shade, and she lifted her hand and the blessing this time was not a joke.

The boy with the console sent him a message later, halting, a confession that had ambitions toward apology. I didn’t think about how it feels, he wrote, like he had lifted for a minute into grammar school and then fallen back to street. Humphrey wrote back a sentence that he wished someone had taught him to carry younger: You can learn a way of looking that doesn’t take more than it uses. The boy sent back a thumbs-up icon, which would have been silly a week earlier and felt like a good inside joke now. He let himself smile at his phone, a foolish expression that got him a quizzical look from a court clerk who had never seen his face do anything but the work.

Blue dots proliferated. They showed up on hands that did not have any reason to show up in nurse practice: a cop at a traffic stop showed one to another cop, grinning as if they had joined a secret club where the only rule was consent; a grocery checker had one and pretended not to notice when it made strangers count their change more carefully; a man on a rig posted a picture of his cracked thumbnail with a dot and a caption that said, “For my wife who stitches things you can’t see.” It became a fad and then a habit, and the difference was how much people argued about it. Children begged for dots and drew on each other until the world became a speckled field. The dot faded as dots do and was remade, and somewhere a person shook his head at the frivolity and somewhere else a person felt less alone because they had marked themselves in a way that told a story without requiring words.

Elena stopped a fight in the waiting room by offering lotion. Two men had found a way to make a seating arrangement into a duel, and she stepped into the space between words and wound up with their hands in her hands, rubbing the sharp smell into knuckles as if the moment were a sprain. They blinked, both of them unprepared for this technique, and looked down at their treated hands and laughed at themselves at the exact same second, which is one of the holiest timings available to the living. She didn’t put it in her charting because charts do not care for the idea that mercy sometimes comes in pump bottles. She tucked the moment into the little book that lives inside the rib cage under the heart.

When the jacket man came around again, he kept a ward’s length of corridor between himself and the place where he had been made to feel the limit of his rights. He wore a different cap and a different expression, and risk management took a copy of his face and filed it under Persons of Interest with the bureaucratic blandness that allows a system to speak without saying anything real. He did not lay a hand on anyone. He learned the look of the security cameras. He found another hospital whose doors were worse at reading, and he went there and was caught by a different version of the same old brake, a volunteer with a braid and an eye for heat. Humphrey kept the file open and the string on his board loose, not because he craved closure but because some knots are better tied when you allow a little slack. He saw Valya across a lobby and did not signal because sometimes you burn a connection by assuming it is always safe to plug it in.

She came to the hub on a day when the air had taken on that late-summer thickness that makes the city smell like its own sweat. She came late, after the tiled floor had been mopped and the mop had leaned like a drunk against a closet. She sat with tape and dictionaries and a busted stapler that worked if you held your tongue right. She asked Dahlia for a pen and got one that had literacy in it, that knew how to write more than numbers. She wrote a sentence at the top of a new section of the wall in a careful print that had learned to dress itself for company: WHAT DID YOUR HANDS LEARN THE HARD WAY. She waited to see if anyone would put anything under it. A man wrote, “They learned the weight of a head when the neck gives up.” A woman wrote, “They learned how to lift without hurting the back by bending the legs.” A boy wrote, “They learned not to hit even when,” and he stopped there, and the white space did the rest.

Later, she found Humphrey on the far side of the lake away from the little dock where boys jump and pretend to argue with the water. He had brought his coffee a shade too strong and his eyes a shade too tired, and he sat with his long back making a convincing case for the letter C. They did not speak at once. They watched an egret pick the shallows, arrogant as always. “Do you forget sometimes to be there,” she said at last, meeting him with a question that had more depth than the water and more mischief than was on offer in the morning light. He thought about lying and decided the person she had offered him was smarter than that. “Sometimes I am here and nobody notices,” he said, and the admission was not a request. “Sometimes I climb back into the outline like a man climbing into a coat. It is not dramatic. I wish it were more interesting, for the sake of the story. It is just a technique.” She nodded and gestured at the boat line with her chin. “Water likes you. It keeps your shape for a little,” she said, and then she stood because standing is a way to answer the gravity that words make. “If you are less one day,” she added, not unkind, “I will remember you big.”

He laughed then, an unkempt thing that startled a duck into indignant speech. “I’ll take that,” he said. “And if you are told no one day too many,” he added, “I’ll say your name to the air loud enough it has to admit you.” Her eyes did the small widening that means a person files a sentence under: to keep. She looked at his hands, at the way the veins sat quiet under skin that had done its share of rowing and writing and holding back and letting go. “What did your hands learn the hard way,” she asked, because she had decided the question wasn’t only for walls. He thought, counted silently in fives the way oarsmen do, and said, “They learned to knock before entering rooms where the rules are made. They learned how to catch without closing down.”

On the ward, Miguel’s flamingos multiplied. He bought three more shirts with small tropical birds and wore them like charms against meetings. He got called into a room twice as often now that he was rumored to be conniving with a detective to soften boundaries and strengthen gates, and he did not deny it because the rumor did him favors. He hewed the line between policy and practice with a grace that would not win him promotions and would keep his people whole a little longer. He watched the dot phenomenon with the indulgent impatience of a man who both disbelieves in symbol and knows they run the world. When a night aide came to him with a complaint about a physician and about the shape the physician had made with his hand by an IV pole as if it had been a leash, Miguel did not ask for a numbered report before he asked if the aide wanted him to walk her out to her car. He took two turns around the lot with her and hoped that counted for something in a column only God keeps.

The man at risk management learned to say Dahlia’s name without introducing it with how are you. He still ironed his shirts to a knife edge, and sometimes when he put one on in the morning his eyes filled, a habit that had developed by accident when his daughter had gone to school far away and not come back in the way parents expect children to fulfill the contract of their old jokes. He wrote a new memo and deleted the sentence that said, The hospital takes seriously any attempts to create unsanctioned displays. He wrote instead, We recognize that the work of care extends beyond the walls. He sent it and it didn’t change the weather and that is not a reason not to send such things.

At the end of a week, the dot chipped again off Elena’s nail, and she let it go without reapplying because sometimes you have to let a charm rest. She sat with Sita on a curb that had been painted red and watched traffic act like human intention. They ate ice from cups and compared the hard little pearls left behind. Sita told a story about a patient who had asked for a blessing and how she had not known whether to use words or silence and had used both, and the patient had smiled without anybody deciding why. Elena looked at her own hand holding the spoon and felt the sudden extravagant love for its shape that a person sometimes feels all at once when they have been busy taking for granted. She wondered if, when she was old, the skin would make maps that told this story or only the story of sunlight and time. She felt guilty for the vanity and then decided it wasn’t vanity; it was documentation.

Night brought cooler air that moved like someone reluctant to leave. The bridge hummed. The river licked at anything that stood in it as if reminding stone of its obligations. Valya sat and moderated three new fights on the group page that had not wanted to be about consent and had been turned into arguments for and against art and then had been rescued by a person who posted a picture of a busted knuckle after a long day pulling peaches and wrote, “This is my vote,” and the thread had quieted itself with a suddenness that made her laugh. She closed her phone and leaned her head back against the pillar and pretended the vertical line behind her was a spine she could borrow. She fell asleep for fifteen minutes and had a dream about a hand pressing a photograph against a wall and the photograph pressing back, not in resistance but to make itself known.

At the lake in the morning, the water looked newly polished, as if someone had sanded it with a soft cloth. Humphrey slid into the boat and let the hull’s tiny complaining become music. The oars took their places like old dogs on favorite chairs. He set, caught, drove, feathered, the chain of it an argument he no longer wanted to win and wanted to keep having. He counted in fours and thought, on the third beat of the second set, that he had not rowed this well the year he first learned to keep straight lines. He allowed himself the luxury of attributing this to the fact that he had spoken a truth in daylight to a person who had given him the gift of an unsarcastic blessing. On the bank, a woman lifted a hand without the scarf because the day permitted it. He could see her teeth shine like tools that had learned a second vocation. He raised his hand back, palm out, the universal sign for there is no weapon here, only skin. The light made a point of noticing him, and he noticed back, the old mutual recognition reestablished in a way that felt like a simple repair you make with tape and faith and decide will hold.Chapter 10

The heat settled like a rule no one had voted for. By noon the air over the asphalt turned to watery glass, and the hospital wore its shadow like a coat too warm to take off in public. People moved through it with the long economy you learn when machines and men both run hot. Inside, the vents exhaled their workable chill and then went quieter than they should, not out of failure but as if the building were trying its hand at thrift. The little cough that generators make at the edge of hearing became background faith. Fluorescents rolled their soft thunder down corridors and settled again. Afternoon announced itself as a set of decisions about what to ignore and what to count.

The wall at the service hub had grown dense and bright. Hands overlapped like leaves. Thumbprints lined up like a parade of moons. Under the heading that Dahlia had called an atlas, the labels had begun to show a humility that made them read truer. “I tie shoes all day for people who would rather be barefoot,” someone had written, and their pen had stopped and then started again like a car with a temperament. “I pick the tape off the place where the IV used to be,” someone else had written, and you could hear the tug and the apology in the strokes. A child had pressed both palms and a forehead to the paper and left a triptych that made gruff men smile against their will. The first pictures had faded a little in the light, and that looked right to everyone who loved the thing; time had started its work and the wall had said yes.

Valya learned the rhythm of days in the room that had been a call center and then a rumor. The lanyard Dahlia had offered lived in her pocket like a harmless secret, and sometimes she pulled it out and let the strap imprint a line on her palm as if teaching her skin how to carry a name without flinching. She wrote replies to the group and changed her replies and then, often, did not press send until she had let the first heat out of her fingers. “Ask,” she typed, and “Wait,” and “No, thank you,” and “Yes, but do not post faces,” and she learned the absurd art of telling a stranger how to be decent without making a show out of it. She removed three posts and kept one that made her uneasy because it had in it a tenderness that was clumsy and trying. Her power, such as it was, tasted like metal on her tongue at first. After a week, it tasted like any other tool in the bag: sometimes you use it and sometimes you leave it.

Humphrey began to watch for the moment in rooms when the sound rose to a pitch that caused glass to do its little tremor and then stopped, not because the source had ceased but because the bodies inside had adjusted to carry more noise without spilling. He carried a notebook card in his breast pocket with five words he kept forgetting and writing again: socks, braid, blue dot, atlas, yes. He put his palm flat against the wall of the hub and felt the throb that old buildings get from a hundred separate, tiny decisions happening at once. Dahlia had taped a list near the coffee that read WHAT WE DO WHEN SOMEONE CRIES HERE: tissues under the table, room to sit, nothing about it being okay, water with ice, no one touches unless asked. He read it and felt the peculiar relief of living in a city where some rooms have instructions you can trust.

The vandal came at three in the morning when even the cats had run out of gossip. He brought with him a cheap can of red paint and a hunger for erasure. The hub’s door had a lock that would disappoint a locksmith if they knew, and the man did not know; he knew about windows. He pushed, he pried, he let himself in with a gentleness that in another context could have been love. The wall surprised him. He had expected something easy to ruin and encountered instead a thing with a spine. He lifted the can and sprayed the center high with a red that meant stop in one language and emergency in others. The paint ran and pooled in the valleys between hands. The names blurred. The dot of oil in a margin went slightly pink and then stubbornly blue again. He made a second scrawl, a shape that wanted to be a word and failed, and he felt the miserable thrill of temporary power. When he turned to leave, he found his way blocked by a woman whose scarf made its own shade and a man whose badge made its own boundary. He did not see them at first because the lights in the space had gone to night brightness, the low kind that shows only what matters to a security camera. He lifted the can again because he did not own any other trick.

Valya stepped into the arc of the can with the calm of a person who has stood too close to worse. She put her hand on the man’s wrist in the now-familiar way that looks like mercy until you try to move. Humphrey stood a pace back, close enough to speak in the register he had been practicing, not loud, not wall, door. The man’s breath smelled like the corners of rooms where worry sleeps in its shoes. He tried to wrench away and found that wrists consider themselves sovereign until they meet a palm that says otherwise. “No,” Valya told the can, not the man. “No,” she told the red, and the paint made a sputtering cough on the concrete and then stopped because the hand had shifted his aim without seeming to. Humphrey did not go for the cuffs right away because sometimes metal is a kind of escalation and sometimes it is a ritual. He asked the man his name and then asked if he was proud, and the man looked at the floor as if it could help him. “You can paint, barefaced,” Humphrey said, and the sentence landed somewhere low and shook a shelf. The man sagged, not with remorse yet, but with that other necessary precursor to it: interruption.

The next morning the wall had a wound and a plan. Dahlia stood with a roll of brown paper and a bucket and looked at the red. The red looked back with the uncomplicated vanity of fresh damage. People came with coffee and grimaces. Elena arrived with Sita and, on seeing the disaster, let out the kind of laugh that is a bark and a weep at once. “Of course,” she said, wiping at the air, as if the gesture could lift paint. Miguel unrolled garbage bags with an efficiency born of months of practice in pretending ordinary supplies could solve moral problems. The boy with the console from the apartment complex came too, hands hovering as if waiting to be told what not to touch. Dahlia did not make a speech. She lifted the bucket and passed it to Valya. “We’ll not erase,” she said. “We’ll translate.” She tore paper and taped it over the anger with that crosshatch that keeps bubbles from bossing the surface. She handed out chalk and oil pastels and told people to trace their hands over the red. The first chalk line captured a ridge in the paint and made it into a vein that looked intentional, and the room made a noise people make when an accident admits to being a door. Hands went up and down, white over red, blue over white, green over blue, until the vandal’s spray stopped being the story and became a part of it, one more layer like regret.

Humphrey photographed nothing because sometimes you do not add a lens to a thing that is already being made right. He stood by the door and said hello as a new volunteer arrived with a tray of donuts so enthusiastically sprinkled it looked like a dare. He had not slept well. His father had been awake all night, old mind turning through the drawers of an old factory and not finding the wrench he needed, and Humphrey had sat with him and counted breaths and learned again the helplessness that visits you when a parent’s face turns to some other season. He had set the man’s hand on the blanket and marveled at how the bones kept announcing themselves even after usefulness had backed up and left, and then he had looked forward to morning the way a child looks forward to a parent coming home. Now the day had produced both trouble and the answer to it. He stood with his hands in his pockets and then he didn’t, because the wall seemed to have a rule about hands.

The jacket man, the one who had learned not to take wrists lightly, showed up around noon as if drawn by red. He stood at the edge of the room with the wariness of a dog who has startled too many times to trust the absence of thunder. He saw the chalking and the way it had made the spray into a ghost that had to sit for its portrait. He made a disapproving sound that the room did not adopt. He left without making another shape. Dahlia watched him go and pressed her tongue to the back of her teeth as if tasting a warning she did not plan to use. She called a city number she had not expected to call and left a message about volunteers and vandalism and the difference between them. The deputy city attorney with the variable specialty called back and said the right phrases with such care they seemed to have been rolled in sugar, and then he asked how much paint had cost and how many hours people had spent touching the wound. Dahlia told him a figure that was both practical and ridiculous. He promised a check and she did not believe him in the way that is not cynicism but self-care.

At the hospital, the power dipped and returned again like someone practicing scales. A woman in a red dress who had come to pick up her mother used the phrase “off the grid” in a waiting room in a way that made the old man next to her tell a story about a cabin he had never finished. Elena worked in a room where the window was fake and the clock was sincere, and she held a hand for ten minutes that were technically not chartable and therefore the best minutes of the day. The dot on her thumbnail had peeled and she had let it. In its place was a faint stain that could have been moon, bruise, or memory. When she washed in the sink, the water came out hesitant, then strong. She checked the machines with the speed of a person who has taught herself to be a rhythm where there wasn’t one. She went to the break room and found a note on the fridge that said, in a calm hand, “Please label your fish.” It made her laugh at the silliness of fish needing names to avoid being borrowed. She wrote EL on her container and underlined it twice as if it might keep her things and her boundaries her own.

Humphrey walked the corridor where the vending coils keep bravely gripping the same bag of jalapeño chips for months. He saw his reflection and he kept it. The trick of slipping had been quieter the last few days, as if attention had learned where to push and where not to. He saw a man arguing with a payment kiosk and stepped in before the argument became a reason to call someone with a waist radio. He did what he does: he lent his voice’s weight and his face’s shape and his posture’s promise. The man breathed and decided to save his anger for something with a heart. Humphrey nodded and moved away. In his head, the oars set, caught, drove, feathered, and he could hear the click like punctuation. When Jo lifted a brow at him from her desk fort of purple envelopes and said, “You hear about the wall,” he nodded and allowed himself to say, “It looks better,” which was not the same as it being good, and was in the neighborhood, which is sometimes close enough to deliver mail.

Valya stood in the cooled echo of the hub in the late afternoon and pressed a caption under the chalk. “Paint does not get to be the last word,” she wrote slowly. “Hands do.” It was a sentence that would have made her blush if anyone had been watching. She had said a foolish, true thing; she had not tried to pretty it. The boy with the console hovered, then picked up a piece of chalk and drew with surprising care the thickened nail of his forefinger at scale, a study in stubbornness. “I got a sister,” he said, as if offering a reason for being decent. “She say if somebody take her picture she will throw a shoe. I told her you delete you call me.” He ducked his head and then added, “I don’t like being a jerk on the internet no more,” which sounded like the sort of promise you need to make more than once. She nodded and handed him tape because tape is forgiveness in a cardboard ring.

In the evening, a notice went up in the staff workroom at Mercy with a red header that would, in another century, have been hair-shirt serious. It reminded everyone that photography on campus was to be limited to designated areas and that unauthorized displays would be removed without apology. Miguel looked at it and then tacked under it a copy of the edited notice with the line of names of people who could invite, and under that he slid a small form that said, in his measured script, “If you want a thing to live here, tell me what it is and who it’s for, and I’ll find it a corner.” The last line drew a small crowd and two eye rolls and a thank you. Policies and gestures sat in a stack on the corkboard like layers of weather. The room made a small jurisdiction of its own, one that ran on permission and good sense and the stubborn refusal to let rules be the final story.

The town hall happened on a Wednesday in a room that used to sell furniture to couples who thought a sofa could save them. The chairs were hopeful in the way chairs are when they have been arranged. The deputy city attorney wore a suit the color of carpet and spoke about liability as if it were weather that only strikes the cruel. Nurses told their night stories with straps of sarcasm to lace them up for public, and people nodded with that big, tired nod that says yes and also we know we will be back here again. Humphrey stood and did not make a speech. He said, “Ask permission,” and “Walk each other,” and “You can call me even when nothing has happened,” and he thought about how words become slogans when rooms get big and felt a small, inappropriate desire to be back in a stairwell. Dahlia stood with her braid and said, “Come to the hub if you have no other place to sit while you get your breath back,” and did not mention cookies because it felt like advertising. Valya watched from the margin and became a gravity the room used without realizing. She stepped back when the television camera hunted for faces, and she held still when a woman approached afterward and said, “I got touched at my elbow too, and I think about it when I’m trying to sleep,” and Valya said, “Me too,” which wasn’t literal and was true.

The lake that week had moods like a teenager: gleaming, then sullen, then mirror, then too busy to reflect anyone but itself. Humphrey rowed. He watched a heron take off with the workmanlike arrogance that big birds have earned. He counted his stroke in eights because he had learned to enjoy the way the number flattens into rhythm if you let it. On the bank, a man in a faded baseball cap,, cast and reeled, cast and reeled, practicing letting go. A dog with three good legs coursed the shore with the conviction of an animal who had made a deal with loss and won. Humphrey felt a tug and thought of the way names anchor you when you don’t want to be anchored and keep you from drifting when you do. When he swung to the dock at last and stood, legs adjusting to ground’s lies, he saw her, scarf gone to the back of her head like a hood, mouth unhidden, teeth calm in their bluntness. She lifted her palm as if to show him it was empty. He lifted his in answer, an exchange he had begun to count as a rite.

Elena got a letter from a cousin who had become a nurse in a bigger city that liked to handle its own myth. The cousin had a picture of her thumb with a green dot and a caption that read, “For your little thing.” Elena laughed and felt irrationally proud, as if the dot had been her child and was now attending school out of state. She set the phone on the locker room bench and secured her hair and looked at herself in the mirror, at a face that performed its competence without flourish. She thought of the wall and of the red paint beneath the chalk and felt the sudden urge to take her nail file and scrape lightly at the edge of the dot until it made a tiny crescent, a moon beginning or ending, she couldn’t tell which. She did not do it. She opened the locker and took out the oil and put it back. She closed the locker and went to find Sita, who had a story about a toddler who had declared all stethoscopes snakes and refused to be convinced otherwise.

Miguel got called into a room where a surgeon, impatient with the pace of the world, had used his hand to describe the direction things ought to be going, and the hand had landed too near an aide’s shoulder, and the aide had shrunk a half inch you could not measure with a ruler. Miguel said the surgeon’s name and said, “I need you to stop doing that thing with your hands,” in the same tone he used to say, “We are out of IV tubing,” and the surgeon blinked as if awakening to the fact that his hands had become a language without his permission. He shrugged and put them into his pockets, which was a solution for that minute and not a rule. The aide exhaled and then left the room to stand in a closet for a full sixty seconds and touch the smooth side of a box of gloves until her shoulders let go of the thought that they were doors.

Risk management sent a check with a memo that got the name of the hub wrong and the amount right enough, and Dahlia mailed a thank you written in a hand that made sincerity look like embroidery. The city attorney parked badly and came in for five minutes that lasted twelve. He spoke with a care that had become genuine from repetition. He admired the wall without stepping close and then did step close, surprising himself. He traced his finger an inch above a chalk line as if heat rose from it, and Valya watched him and decided, for reasons she could not justify, to forgive him preemptively for a thing he had not yet decided to do. He left a card and a sentence and the sentence was useless and charming. “We’re trying to keep the thread from breaking,” he said, and Dahlia said, “It frays anyway,” and they smiled at the smallness of the truth.

Night brought its small police work. A man on a bench near the emergency entrance pretended his arm hurt to get in out of the heat because pretending one pain is sometimes how you spare yourself another. Humphrey called him by a name that was not his and the man sat up, affronted on instinct, and said, “That ain’t me,” and laughed because he had betrayed himself. They stood in the weather and negotiated a bottle of water, a chair inside, an absence of handcuffs. Humphrey walked him to the door and said, “Hands in pockets until you’re past the desk,” and the man complied with the solemnity of a person who has agreed to a potion’s rules. Back at the hub, the atlas dried where the chalk had gone dense and oil had been smudged by the soft sleeve of a child’s sweater. Valya took a picture of the red beneath showing through at the edges and did not post it, because not everything makes sense when flattened. She pressed the folded altered notice into the spine of her album and found it fit there as if meant to keep the whole from slumping.

Near midnight, under the bridge, a breeze from nowhere moved up the river as if the city had cracked a window. The words chalked onto concrete had multiplied with that polite promiscuity chalk has. Somebody had written WE ARE STILL HERE and someone else had added BECAUSE WE KEEP SAYING SO. Valya set her back against the pillar and let her hands rest palm up on her knees as if she were advertising emptiness. The phone vibrated with a message from a woman who had long fingers and a way of writing that made even simple sentences feel like songs. “I told him no today and I didn’t feel smaller,” the message read. Valya breathed and wrote back, “I will put that on the wall if you let me.” The dots pulsed, three, two, one, and the yes came through with a heart that did not disgust her. She clicked the phone dark and listened to the rivets speak to each other in the bridge’s belly, a talk low and reassuring and older than her troubles.

Humphrey sat beside his father and watched the old man’s dreams move under his skin in the way that warm-air currents move over a field. He put his hand out and the old hand found it in the dark with that miraculous accuracy the body maintains even after minds retire. For a moment he felt the scatter of himself settle, as if his outline had been redrawn with a blacker pencil. He thought about the chalk lines over the red paint, the way they had domesticated injury, and he wondered if that was a thing you could do to grief or if grief insists on being left alone to spend its allowance unobserved. He said the names he had said before, lying and sitting up and lying again, a litany that would never be taught in a church but should be: Dahlia, Miguel, Jo, Sita, El, Valya. He fell asleep in the chair with his head tipped back and dreamed of hands tapping a beat lightly on a surface he could not identify; when he woke, he realized it was his own thigh.

By week’s end the wall had a section labeled AFTER, and under it sat new things that would have made the first batch uncomfortable and proud. A photograph of a nurse’s hand over a patient’s hand wearing a foam ring that looked like a dollar-store halo. A sketch of the heel of a palm pressing a chest barely sketched, the universal push that keeps a person. A note in a tidy script reading, “I don’t like to be touched, but I like to be asked. Thank you for asking.” A child had drawn in careful crayon a blue dot on a cartoon thumb that was the size of a shoe, and wrote, laudably, in uppercase, MY MOM SAID YES TODAY. The crowd at the opening of this second wall was just whoever was there, which is what you want from religion. A woman who had sworn she would never let a picture of anything she owned go onto the internet or a wall anywhere held her hand up and let a volunteer trace it, and when the chalk tickled she laughed, and the laugh was not the laugh she used for customers. It was the laugh she used for herself.

The last of the week’s heat gave way one evening to that slight wet cool that comes when a far-away coast decides to be generous and sends its weather inland like a postcard. The wind ran its hand over the city’s hair and put some of it back in place. On the lake, Humphrey rowed into a light that had not yet decided to be dramatic and found himself smiling at nothing special, which had become his favorite form of happiness. On the bank the woman with the scarf lifted her hand without the scarf today, and he returned the gesture and then, because it felt like a step in a choreography they had both earned, he lifted the oar in a small salute. She nodded. The river under the bridge hummed, and the two veterinary offices on the block where she sometimes slept glared at each other across their shared truths. Dahlia sent a photo of the red under the chalk to a mailing list with the subject line This is not a disaster, and people wrote back with words like honor and fix and lesson and liked their own sentences too much, and she forgave them, as one does to people who are trying.

Valya sat with her album and her folded notices and sketched, on a receipt’s blank side, a line that might become a door. She thought of the boy with three good legs, and of the nurse whose dot had chipped, and of the deputy attorney who had touched the air above the chalk. She thought of the man with the red, perhaps sleeping, perhaps planning, perhaps finding somewhere else to spend the part of himself he had not yet named. She put the pencil down and pressed her thumb to the paper until the pad left an oval that looked like it wanted to be a vowel. She wrote next to it, in her square print, ASK ME, and beneath that, the answer she had learned to make into a muscle: I WILL TRY TO SAY YES. She folded the paper and put it with the others and slept, for a while, not because the city gave her permission but because the body sometimes outruns the argument and decides that rest is the only sensible rule.

Morning returned with its plain offerings. A cup. A handle. A button. A turn. A knock. A lift. The boat waited with its animal patience. The wall dried another shade lighter. The dot trend turned into a thing children forgot until their parents reminded them. The nurse who had learned to say no without shrinking practiced yes until it stopped feeling like a trick. The detective who had once belonged on the water learned that you could be held by a city if you stood still long enough in the right places. The woman whose teeth had made her an exile wrote the word welcome in her book and then crossed it out and wrote it again because the first one did not look like she meant it. The river did its perfect refusal to take advice. In the sticker-coated staff room a sign went up that said WALKING BUDDY BOARD and under it names arranged themselves into pairs with the tentative glee of people picking teams for a game they hope will be fun and not humiliating. And in a pocket of light at a curb that had been painted red by a tired hand years ago, Sita pulled a splinter out of a stranger’s thumb with such grace that the man said thank you and then, as if the splinter had been made of bad mood, laughed at everything on the street until his friend had to tell him to hush. The day agreed. The day said, out loud and without flourish, yes.
