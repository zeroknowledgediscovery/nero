Basildon wakes up like a machine with a gentle stutter, light sliding down the concrete ribs of tower blocks and over the tin roofs of the garages where boys build their futures with socket wrenches and songs. Jaroslav runs past the estate playground still greasy with last night’s takeaway air, and the gulls from the estuary fly low as if offended that land dares to exist. He runs because he likes the feeling of parts working, the symmetry of muscle and breath and road. He runs because it cleans his head. By the time he reaches the market square, the traders are rolling awnings up with ropes that rasp—rasp like the laugh of his aunt—and the buskers are warming up to the tune of coins.

He is twenty-two and called a stud by lads who mean it as both praise and warning. When he laughs, his cheek does that one shallow dent that mothers of best friends notice and pretend not to notice. He fixes cars at a repair shop off the A132, where there’s always a wet footprint by the door and the smell of rubber, petrol, and hand soap. His mother says he was born under a moving sign. He doesn’t know what that means, except that sometimes he dreams of long roads and dark water and cities where no one knows his name except for the one who needs to.

On the evening he meets her, the sky is pressed down like a lid. He turns off the ring road and follows a queue of tired people into the adult education centre that hides behind an unambitious hedge. He had signed up on his lunch break at the insistence of his boss’s girlfriend, who is always leaving flyers behind the coffee machine. Learn something, not just bolts. Improve yourself, she had said, and then, after a look that could have been platonic or could have not, Literature is not just posh people and ghosts.

The course is called Worlds by Water: Literature of Coasts and Crossings, which is exactly the sort of title that makes him want to laugh and sign up automatically. He arrives early, because he always does when he doesn't know something, and sits in the back where escape routes multiply. The room is an unholy marriage of plastic and chalkboard; the lights flicker like slow eyes. He opens the battered notebook he keeps for quotes and measurements and the word “carburettor,” and draws a ship without meaning to.

When she comes in she isn’t impressive in the big way, not at first. Her hair is pinned up like a secret and came loose in the front so there’s this tendril that is simply not following orders. She is wearing a dark sweater with a tiny hole at the cuff, and a skirt that looks like it remembers the wind. She writes her name on the board as if the chalk has opinions. Lorna Marek, it reads, in a firm forward hand. The sound of the chalk is a note in a song.

“Hello,” she says, and the room seems to know how to breathe differently. “We’ll be tracing storms and borders. We’ll think about why people leave and what they carry. We’ll read poets who were cold on ships and men who saw their homes from the wrong angle. And we’ll talk. People always talk around water. It makes them.”

Someone asks if this is about travel. Someone else asks if there will be exams. She laughs, the kind of laugh that doesn’t apologise for itself. “It’s about what happens at edges,” she says. “And I’ll only examine you with questions you want to answer.”

They begin with a poem by a man who had language like ropes. Jaroslav reads slowly, lips moving, the way he always does when a sentence scares him a little. He doesn’t speak up until the last fifteen minutes, after a woman with soft voice says something about pilgrimage, and a man with a moustache says something about empire, and everyone nods as if nodding is proof. Then, without thinking, Jaroslav lifts his hand.

“Water has a memory,” he says. His accent slides the words into one another like they are cousins. “Back where I’m from, in Ostrava, my grandma said the river knew the way to the sea even when you dam it and make everything square. She said it would always find. I think—maybe—some people are like that. They get blocked by things. But they still remember.”

He hears himself, hears the way his voice sounds different in this room, and wants to retrieve the words, jam them back into the cave. But Lorna Marek is looking at him with a kind of awed encouragement as if he has pulled a bird from a hat and set it free.

“What’s your name?” she asks.

“Jaroslav,” he says. “But most say Jaro.”

“Jaro, that’s—” She nods once, approving. “Memory is an engine here. That poem is full of it. Thank you. That’s exactly the sort of thing we need.”

He goes home buoyed and stupidly happy, and that night he lies awake in the box room that used to be his older brother’s. On the shelf above him are model cars, a map of the A roads of Britain, a faded magnet shaped like a lighthouse from a holiday they took to Norfolk when he was ten. He remembers his father singing in a language that had salt in it. He remembers a ring in a drawer, too, a piece of costume jewellery that his grandmother kept wrapped in a scarf. Not his. Not anything. He wonders, as he drifts, if water is a person.

Basildon is not the sort of place people write novels about, but people live here and that is enough for stones to learn how to speak. In the shop the next day he changes tyres and hears the radio shouting about ferry delays; he thinks about Lorna’s hand moving in a small arc on the board as she draws a coastline. He goes to class again, and again. He starts sitting nearer the front. He brings a coffee in a paper cup and sets it down carefully near hers. It leaves a ring, which makes him think—ridiculously—how rings mark things, how they claim. He never says the wrong thing to her; he saves those for his mates. But he writes, in the private country of his notebook, lines that he doesn’t recognise as his.

“You aren’t like other car boys,” says Noor, who sits next to him sometimes. “No offence.”

“None is taken,” he says, smiling. “What are ‘other car boys’ like?”

“Very sure of the world not changing,” she answers, clicking her pen. “You look like if the world changed you’d manage.”

He shrugs. “We live on moving ground,” he says, without quite knowing where it came from.

After three classes, Lorna assigns a short piece to write. Describe a crossing, true or invented, and what was lost; what was kept. He thinks about the ferry from Calais to Dover, the first time he returned to England as a nine-year-old and the water was green-black and smelled the way new pennies taste. He writes about the corridor on the ferry and the carpet with little anchors, and his mother sleeping with her head on the table. But he keeps detouring, telling the story of a man who walked out onto the mudflats at low tide with a lantern and a promise. When he prints it, the paper still warm, he feels like someone halfway through saying something risky.

She calls him up after class, and his stomach does the thing. “Jaro,” she says, holding his pages as if they are breathing creatures. “This is lovely. The ending is—” She taps it. “The silence before the last line. That’s—what did you leave out? I can feel it.”

“My father,” he says. It slips out. “He is here and not here. He is like a fog.” He gestures, then stops, embarrassed at his own drama. “Sorry.”

“Don’t apologise,” she says softly. “The best sentences are accidents. You can craft them later. Your river—where you grew up—what was it called?”

“Ostravice,” he says. “It feeds Morava. Then Danube. Then Black Sea. It is a string that pulls. I liked it. Even when it stank.”

“You have a good ear,” she says. “You write how you listen.”

He wants to tell her he listens to her voice in the evenings when he cleans the filter at work, that he hears the way she pronounces ‘estuary’ with a soft invitation and it makes him amused and calm. He wants to tell her that he’d follow her onto a boat simply to watch her watch the horizon. Instead he says, “Thank you,” and collects his pages as if they might bite.

Basildon slides through winter toward spring in a way that is mostly about rain. The course goes on. They read Hardy, and he hates it and loves it simultaneously. They argue about borders vs. boundaries, and he tries to think of the difference between the skin and what is under it. One night, after a session on sailors’ superstition, she brings in an object wrapped in tissue. She unwraps it with respect, like a priest.

“My grandmother kept this,” she says. “Her brother fished out of Leigh for a while. This ring came to us god-knows-how—story says, a trawler pulled up a lockbox with nothing in it but this. It’s probably nothing. Cheap brass. But she always said it was a charm ring. That it belonged to someone who never came back, and that it was looking for the hand that would. Families tell themselves all sorts of beautiful lies to make not knowing survivable.”

She holds it up and it looks like rubbish and treasure together. A dull circle, greened in places, with a pattern worn away by pocket lint and sweat and years in the mouth of the river.

“Can we—?” says Noor.

“Of course,” Lorna says, passing it around. It feels warm to his touch, though the room is drafty. He expects to feel some cliché: a jolt, a voice, a memory that isn’t his. Instead, he feels the weirdest thing: a pressure, like the ring is a small eye looking back. A question mark pressed into his palm.

“Stupid thing,” says a man in a fleece, fondly. “My nan had a spoon like that. Everyone thought it was cursed because Uncle Tom choked. He choked because he ate too fast.”

People laugh. Jaro slides the ring onto the tip of his index finger, just to judge its size, and it slips down farther than he expects, stops at the second knuckle. He feels his pulse sneak by it. He takes it off quickly and gives it to Noor, convinced for a second—just a second—that it wanted to stay.

They read about rings in old sagas. They read about tokens that return home through fire and seawater and stubbornness. Lorna smiles at how seriously half the class takes it, at how superstitious the other half pretends not to be. As they leave, she holds the ring a moment, and her look, while private, is not unobserved.

“Do you—believe it?” he asks as they end up at the door together, coat buttons up, rain like static.

“I believe that objects can hold our stories better than we can. More patiently,” she says. “I believe people put meanings on anything round and permanent because we aren’t. I like the thought of a ring refusing to be lost. That’s a good kind of stubborn.”

He doesn’t know that he will think of those words every time he looks at a coin tray or a gasket or a child’s plastic bracelet, but he will. He doesn’t know yet that his life will alter because of something as small as a circle. He only knows that when she speaks, the centre of things—in him—feels identified.

And then time compresses. The course is halfway done. Their reading lists become a kind of secret language. He begins to notice details about her he would never have dignified in anyone else: a line that appears at the corner of her mouth when she’s not sleeping enough; the way she checks the window for weather as if it might act out; the careful manner she has of returning a borrowed pen, cap first, cap secure. He doesn’t tell anyone. He doesn’t even tell himself in words he could quote. It sits in him like a fire the size of a fist.

It is a Tuesday when she announces it, the same day a lorry jack-knifes on the A13 and the town is delayed and annoyed like a person with a stone in his boot. She is halfway through noting the difference between "coast" and "shore" when she pauses, chalk set down in the little rim. “I need to tell you,” she says. “I’m going away for a while. A long while.”

The words hit the air and rearrange it. People shift. Someone says, “New job?” as if saying it makes it acceptable.

“I’ve been asked to join a survey team,” she says, and her mouth lifts on one side the way it does when she is trying to share something significant without making it about her. “A research vessel—small—doing hydrographic work and some cultural documentation along the North Sea. Three months. Maybe five. I’ll teach the rest of the term online, and I’ve asked that the in-person be covered by someone I trust,” she adds quickly, for the benevolent order of administrators, but her eyes find Jaro and linger, just a fraction too long. “It’s a chance. I’ve been…not waiting, but ready.”

“Wow,” Noor says. “That’s brilliant. Sea legs.”

“Wear the ring,” jokes the man with the fleece, and she grins.

“I may,” Lorna says. “If only to remind me that circles end up where they should.”

He is not stupid. He smiles when everyone smiles. He nods when they talk about envy and adventure and how unfair it is when interesting people are temporary. He goes to the pub afterwards because that is what they do, a clutch of them, to metabolise sentences. He drinks soda and lime because he’s running early tomorrow and he wants to keep his head clear. He listens to their talk turn into an airy knot of what-ifs, then ducks out into the cold like a diver finding air.

At home, he cleans. It is what he does when he wants control: he polishes spanners until his reflection looks like a ghost in them; he takes apart the toaster and puts it back together; he alphabetises spices no one uses except smoked paprika, which is gone anyway. He goes to the drawer where his grandmother kept the scarf-wrapped ring when he was a boy and finds only the scarf itself, which now smells like a wardrobe. He laughs at himself. He goes to bed. He falls asleep quickly but wakes before five with his body convinced it is an instrument waiting for a cue.

The next day he stays behind after class without saying he will. The others file out, chattering about whether to read Conrad again or never again. Lorna is packing her bag in the way that suggests she is also thinking three other thoughts, one of which cannot be pleasing to think. He walks up as if drawn and says her name once, as if to find out if it feels the same when no one is listening.

“Jaro,” she says. His name in her mouth is another country.

“I wanted to say congratulations,” he begins. “And, also, that—” He stops. The rules he has taught himself, the ones about never playing the song that will make you foolish, do not abandon him, but they loosen. He tries again. “You’ve been—” He gestures. Words do not fit the shape of what he means. “I like how you teach,” he blurts, and at once wants to apologise for the inadequacy of liking.

She smiles, and the mischief in it rescues him from himself for a second. “That’s good,” she says lightly. “I’ve had practice.”

“I will miss you,” he hears himself say, plain. The air feels like something is expected from it.

Her eyes change in a small way. The light in the classroom is the careful kind, the white hum. He sees how tired she is and how alive. “I will miss this,” she says, and means him too—does she?—he cannot tell. “It’s always hard to leave in the middle of something that knows how to continue without you. But that’s the test.”

He nods. He is trying not to grip the desk with his hand like someone about to be thrown. The ring is by the chalk; she picks it up and holds it absently like a coin she needs for a bus. “I’ll be back,” she says. “Unless the sea decides to keep me. It’s greedy, water. It loves to keep.”

“I am good at finding,” he says, without humour, with the force of a promise he doesn’t know he’s making.

She looks at him, searching his face the way she reads the margin notes of a book from a charity shop. “I know,” she says finally, and reaches into her bag. She pulls out a small paperback—W.G. Sebald, the cover with an oval photograph like a window—and hands it to him. “Take this. There's a map sketched in the back,” she adds in a voice that tries to sound like a joke. “It tells you where the gulls gossip at low tide, and where the tea is not a rip-off at Leigh. Read page sixty-two if you get lonely. It’s not a cure, but it’s honest.”

He takes it, careful with it like it might embarrass itself. “Thank you.”

She hesitates. Her hand dips to the ring and then doesn’t. “And Jaro,” she says, more quietly, “your writing—you should enter the college prize. Don’t roll your eyes, I saw that. You should. Your voice knows the way to something.”

“Like the river,” he says, weakly, and they both smile at their small shared mythology.

That weekend, she is simply gone. Basildon does not adjust. It simply continues in its certain way. He goes to work; he watches a seagull try to intimidate a pigeon by the cashpoint; he goes to a party and stands in a kitchen while music tries to come through a wall. He checks his phone more than he will admit to. The replacement teacher is fine and knows things about ballads and whaling that are probably useful in some part of the world, but not this part. He reads page sixty-two and does not feel cured. He takes the train down to Leigh-on-Sea because choosing a place is better than choosing not to.

On the cobbles, the air smells like salt and vinegar and low tide, which is its own complicated flavour. He walks to the old cockle sheds and watches the men in boots do what their fathers did, only with different machines. He thinks of her hands. He thinks of rings and of not-lost. He goes into a pub where the chairs are proud of being wood and drinks the kind of tea that insists on being itself. The book’s back page has, as she said, a map in pencil. Someone—her—has drawn a small X where the seawall kinks and a note: Ask about the old lightship. They always want to tell it.

He walks there because he is obedient to marks and because he needs to invent errands for his heart. The seawall is something to lean on. Two old men are leaning on it. They look like they’re from a photograph when people wore belts and opinions differently.

“Excuse me,” he says, feeling ridiculous. “Do you know about the old lightship? I heard that it—”

“Trinity House dragged it off,” says the taller one immediately, pleased to know things. “Used to be a museum. Shame to see it go. You a student? Got that look.”

“I am, in a way,” he says. “My teacher—she had a ring. Said it was pulled from a trawler. A charm of some kind.”

“Ah,” they both say together, delighted that the story has arrived. “Rings,” says the shorter one, who has a wool cap pulled low. “Lots of them in the water. Sailors wore them to pay for the ferryman. Some say if your body comes up wearing a ring, the sea feels cheated and spits you back. Romantic nonsense, funny old nonsense. There was a lad—years back—found a ring on the mud near Canvey. Claimed it kept turning up in his pocket, even when he threw it away. We said he were off his trolley; still, there was always a ring when he paid for his pint.”

They laugh. Jaro laughs too, though something in him is paying attention with seriousness. “Near Canvey?”

“Yep. Chapman Sands. That whole stretch,” says the taller one, pointing like a general.

“You’re not going to go looking for treasure,” says the other, amused and kind.

“No,” Jaro says, and smiles. Then, surprisingly to himself, “Maybe.”

He goes back via Benfleet and buys a cheap pair of boots meant for mud and something cheaper, some laces that will snap at the worst moment. He goes home and looks up tide times, a language that seduces him with its certainty, the swagger of numbers that predict the moods of a giant. He reads about the estuary and its sandbanks, its good behaviour and its drownings. He dreams of a ring that fits his finger like a command.

When she emails, it’s a photograph of a deck scabbed with rust and a horizon line that is not wrong and a caption that says, Did you know the North Sea has thirty names if you ask all the people who touch it? He looks at it too long. He writes back, eventually: I did not. But I would like to know ten of them, at least. How is the tea. Then deletes it and writes: It looks cold. Bring back a list. The right words. He adds a drawing of a small ring, as if she will see.

He goes out when the tide is going out because people who know this land say that’s the friendliest time. He walks the path and then the not-path. The mud sucks and laughs around his boots, and the gulls look at him like critics. He feels stupid and alive. He doesn’t really believe in magic in the way that makes people put up horseshoes or touch wood; he believes in grit and in choosing. But also—he believes in the art of paying attention. If a ring is here, if it is meant to belong to him the way sentences sometimes arrive and he recognises them, then it will show itself. If not, he will still have walked the map of someone else’s story and seen how the wind draws straight lines nobody can hold.

On the third evening of looking, when his calves are a good ache and the clouds are the colour of a bruise almost healed, he meets a kid with a metal detector who looks like every cousin he has except for the braces. The kid nods at him like they are both in on something.

“Anything?” the kid says.

“Plastic, mostly,” Jaro says, holding up a bottle cap as if it is an offering. “You?”

“Nails. A spoon. A coin that turned out to be from Spain,” the kid says, with grandeur. “I’m saving up for a better coil. Your boots aren’t bad.”

“My boots are liars,” he says, and they both laugh like the river is telling them a joke no one else would.

He nearly turns back then. He nearly decides that he is performing some melodramatic ouroboros of yearning and that he is very silly, a word his mother uses like a slap and a kiss. He nearly tells himself that the world does not work like this and that men like him do not find the one magic thing and set it right. He nearly. But the light changes. A shaft of low sun finds a narrow curve in the muck. It is not glamorous. It looks like a broken washer. He bends anyway, because he is obedient to circles.

His fingers sink to the cold. There is something there—of course there is something there; the estuary is full of somethings. He pries it up with a flat rock and the ring comes with a sound. Not a clink. A small release, like a breath he’s been waiting to hear.

It is foul. It is covered in the kind of stink that makes seagulls feel virtuous. It is green-black and ridged with some old pattern that migration and time taxed. He holds it. The way his fingers remember its weight is a surprise, a ridiculous little shock up through his arm into his chest. It doesn’t tingle. The sky does not go soft. But something fits, like the click of a ratchet finally set in the right tooth.

He thinks about nothing and everything, and then, ridiculous, because he has no one to impress, he says out loud, “I have you,” to a piece of relic that may be a washer and may be a promise. And then he laughs at himself and at the river and at whatever old good hands put this object into this path for him.

Behind him, the kid with the detector whistles low. “Is that—?”

“I don’t know,” Jaro says, honestly. “But—” He looks at the ring and it looks back, not with eyes, but with a patience he recognises. He thinks of Lorna’s hand on the chalk, of her face when she held up the classroom ring to the light. He imagines lines between points he cannot see. The map at the back of the book burns in his pocket, not from heat, but from fact. “But,” he says again, “it was asking to be found.” He hears himself and is no longer embarrassed by his own certain tone.

He cleans it at the tap behind the cockle stand. The man there does not ask; he has seen it all; but he watches with a fond contempt. “If that’s a ring,” the man says, “I’ll eat that bucket of clam shells.”

“Don’t,” Jaro says. “It will hurt your teeth.” He rubs the thing with a cloth until it stops pretending to be trash. The pattern shows itself in stubborn lines: a series of small waves and, between them, a shape like an eye, or like the almond of an old saint’s aura. Inside, a faint scratching—a letter?—the suggestion of an initial, nothing more. It is the sort of thing that makes meaning hungry.

He doesn’t put it on. He knows enough to not do that. He wraps it in the Sebald page he will never again read without touching the hole it left. He takes it home like a smuggled jewel, and when he gets to his room, he places it on the shelf next to the lighthouse magnet that now looks like an instruction.

He writes her a message he will not send: I found something the size of a promise. I am not sure of the terms yet. He writes one he will: Hope the sea did not take your pen. I saw a gull with courtly manners. The tea is better than expected. He doesn’t say ring. He doesn’t say I will bring you back to this shore even if your ship decides to be greedy, even if the maps get crossed.

That night, the wind rises. It grates at the corners of his windows like a door daring him to try it with the wrong key. He sleeps with the ring on the table beside his bed like a watchful beetle. He dreams once that he is on a deck not very different to the photograph she sent, and the sky is a pale bruise again, and a wave stands up like a correction and then sits down properly. He hears a voice that might be hers or might be the river’s say, Find me a way home that I cannot argue with. He wakes with that sentence in his mouth and the knowledge—not yet plan, not yet practical—that the circle he found in the mud is the same size as a story that refuses to end where it is told to. That stubbornness speaks a language he has always understood. He lies there. He thinks: it begins. He thinks—in Czech, because some nights require that particular simplicity—Začíná.Chapter 2

The night after he found the ring, he lay awake listening for a forecast he had never before cared about beyond its music. The radio made the estuary sound like a classroom of old gods answering roll call: Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, Humber, Thames, Dover. The voice was so calm that it made the thought of gales feel like tidying. He held the ring in his palm the way wartime photographs showed men holding cigarettes, as if the moment mattered too much to grip. When he finally slept, the names leaked into his dream and arranged themselves along a road he knew, and he drove down them in a car whose engine he could not quiet because it spoke in words instead of noise.

In the morning, ordinary life asserted itself with its small queue of jobs that couldn’t be ignored. A Renault with a cough and a Peugeot that sulked in reverse and a Transit whose brakes had opinions. The boss had arguments with an invoice and with himself; the boss’s girlfriend came in twice, once with a stack of flyers for a performance poetry night and once because she had left her keys between the counter and the jar of boiled sweets again. “You look like you swallowed a magnet,” she said, peering at him over the coffee machine. “Everything is sticking to you. Good or bad?”

“Only filings,” he said, amused at himself and the truth of it. He had put the ring on a string he made from paracord, looped neat like a knot the Scouts would applaud, and it sat under his shirt, warm with him. He didn’t like the thought of wearing it where it could be seen in oil and accident; he liked the thought of it against his sternum like a tunneled sound. He was not a superstitious person in the way that needed a phrase to touch or a set number of steps to the door, but he had always believed in machines and in the justice of materials, and this piece of metal felt like a statement he would have to repeat until it was understood.

At lunch he ate outside on the low brick where people smoked, even though the wind kept adjudicating against chips. Ben from tyres came out and told him about his cat, and a man with a tattoo of a crown said, casually, “You hear anything from your sea professor yet? Noor says she sent an email with a picture of a jellyfish like a lamp.”

“Like a lamp?” he repeated, pleased by the image, and then, because this was his cue to be a person who participated, “Noor is watching her inbox like a seagull.”

“She’ll be fine,” the man with the crown said firmly, because that was the correct thing to say when you wanted a result without admitting you couldn’t make one. “They all have vests and radios. And luck. They don’t send people out in mad weather. Not for spreadsheets.”

That afternoon, a woman came in to ask about a strange knocking in her hatchback and whether the knocking meant the end of something expensive. He checked the wheel nuts and found one loose, a stupid, almost indecent problem, like finding a shirt done up wrong by one button. She said thank you three times and then once more from the door as if the word could cover how close she came to the idea of a ditch. He could not explain why the small heroism of that fix made him want to go run and run until the ring at his chest marked time with his ribs. The thought arrived: that’s what you do, you tighten what is already there, you listen for knocks, you steady, you send away, you wait for the ones you cannot see.

He took the ring off that night and set it down on the table to look at it without the weather of his body confusing it. Under the desk lamp he could see the pattern more clearly: the little waves, the eye-shape between, the faint mark that refused to commit to an alphabet. He thought of his grandmother’s drawer and her scarf, and the other ring that wasn’t there now, and of the way she used to say, “People will make an altar out of anything. Sometimes that’s good.” He wanted to ask her which ones had been good for her. He wanted to ask his mother what the moving sign had meant. He went downstairs and found her in the kitchen making tea with that precise attention that made shops of simple acts.

“You’re late,” she said without looking at the clock, because he was and she always had a sense for the shape lateness left in the air. “You ate?”

“I did,” he said. “I will again if you will keep looking at me like that.”

“You should,” she said, and slid a plate toward him with a piece of cake on it as if she had decided for him. “You are running like a hare these days. Slow down so the luck can catch you. What is the thing?”

He could tell she meant the state of his head, not any particular noun, but he put the ring on the table anyway because he was tired of talking around a round. She glanced at it, then looked, and then made the face of a person who is rearranging a box of photographs as a certain face turns up. “Huh,” she said, and picked it up. The way she held it was different than the way he did; she held it like it might be the lid of something.

“I found it,” he said. “On the mud, at low tide. Down at Leigh. It is stupid and it is not stupid.”

“It is not stupid,” she said at once, and the certainty in her voice made a little space for something to sit down. “Hands leave their shape in metal. That is an old thought and a true one. This—” She squinted at the inside where the suggestion of a letter pretended it wasn’t playing at being a secret. “This looks like—maybe—an M. Or an inverted V. Or maybe nothing. You want me to tell you a story about it.”

“I don’t know what I want,” he said. “I think I want the right use. I don’t know what that is yet.”

She turned it in her fingers. “When we came the first time,” she said, meaning England and meaning that year when he was little and everything had a border and those borders felt like corners you could bruise yourself on, “your father bought a ring off a stall at the market in Stratford. It was junk, cheap brass that made his finger green, but he liked how it felt to buy an English thing with English coins that had a queen staring at you like a teacher. He wore it until he lost it, and then he said it had found where it needed to be. He was like that. He would give away his jacket and say, ‘It wanted a different back.’ It made me love him. It made me crazy.”

“What did the moving sign mean?” Jaro asked, because if he didn’t ask then he would never. “You said I was born under it.”

She laughed a little, and in the laugh was a long car and a night and a woman who has been many places with fewer instructions than she wanted. “It was in Ostrava,” she said. “On the road to the hospital, a detour because the city decided to fix something that was not broken. The big orange sign with the arrow kept changing direction because the wind kept turning it, and the lights were flicker-flicker, and your father laughed and said we should follow the sign because it was clearly alive. We did, and we got lost, and then we got you. I said after that you would never obey if the directions were not believing in themselves. He said you would be a person who could follow a thing that was moving. I suppose both are true.”

He thought about signs and obedience and the way a ring could be a sign and also a direction. He ate cake and wanted to cry for reasons that had nothing to do with sugar. “Do you think I should wear it?” he asked. “Or wait.”

“Wear it when you need a question,” she said. “Keep it in your pocket when you need to be brave but not seen. Do not loan it to people who cannot return knives on time. Put it somewhere obvious when you sleep. It is only a piece of metal. It is only not.”

The next class, the substitute teacher smiled like a person who had been told a good joke before walking in. He wore a tweed jacket that was tired in the elbows and he spoke about ballads and whaling like someone who had loved a book more than a person. Noor sat with Jaro at the edge of the knot of chairs and whispered in the margin. “He knows things,” she said. “I didn’t know I wanted to know them.”

“He is good at being a book out loud,” Jaro said, and hoped that didn’t sound unkind. He kept looking at the door as if a woman with a tired mouth and awake eyes might come in anyway by mistake.

After class, Noor said, “Walk?” in the voice that meant both talk and no pressure to talk. They walked to the square where the stalls were mostly packed and the smell of fruit and fish was an argument left over from earlier. She tilted her head at him the way she tilted her head at pages when their sentences were trying to hide. “Tell me what the ring is,” she said. “Because you are carrying it like you are the post and it is a letter that wants a signature.”

He laughed because there was no point not to. “I found it,” he said, and told the story, because he had learned that telling it made his head less tight around it. When he finished, Noor looked pleased and serious.

“You’re not going to marry the sea with it, are you?” she asked, and when he blinked, she added, “Old stories. Men throw rings into water and promise themselves to it. It never ends well.”

“I am not a husband,” he said, but even as he said it, the thought made a small shelter in his chest. “Maybe I will loan it. Maybe I will bring it to someone who already said she might wear such a stubborn circle.”

“Do you truly believe that ring wants to be with her?” Noor asked. “I don’t mean like romance. I mean like magnets and filings.”

“I think it wants to be where it is understood,” he said. “I think that is what objects want. Same as people.”

“Write that down,” she said promptly. “Did you enter the prize, by the way? I will bully you if you did not.”

“I did,” he said, and it felt both like a confession and like a thing that had been inevitable since the first class when the chalk made a summer snow on her fingers. “I sent the piece about the ferry that isn’t about the ferry. I took out the man and the lantern and put back my father’s jacket.”

“You are going to win,” she said, not to be flattering, but because she liked to make the future sound like a table already set. “And if you do not, I will say the opposite the whole summer until the world is forced to obey.”

The emails from the ship came in batches as if the sea had set up visiting hours. Photographs of shoals drawn in numbers and of skies that performed a version of the sky for people who needed horizon to be a string taught across a map. A picture of a mug with a cracked handle and a caption, Tea: weak, as if apologising for being British. Then a paragraph that had the texture of nights when she stayed too long in the classroom after everyone left and let her words sit down. She wrote, We are tracing lines that human hands can read so other hands can avoid the invisible teeth. The men here—mostly men—have hands like stories. Each knuckle is an argument with something that didn’t want to be moved. Yesterday we pulled up an old buoy chain that had forgotten it was a chain. I thought of that ring. Is it behaving.

He wrote back in careful sentences that he hated for their carefulness. He wanted to say, I found another. He wanted to say, I will take a train to wherever you dock and stand on a quay in a jacket that will make me look like a man who understands the weather. He wrote, It is behaving like a small moon, moving my small tide. He added, The kid with the metal detector says he will find me enough coins to buy a kingdom. He didn’t say, I am counting the names they say on the radio and thinking of you when they say Thames.

On a Saturday, when the sun took its role seriously and Basildon looked briefly like a place that had ambitions, he went with Noor to the Thames Barrier because the substitute teacher had said something about it being a cathedral that pretends to be a machine. The day smelt of river and hot tarmac. The silver hoods stood in the water like the backs of patient animals that had agreed, for now, not to move. Jaro leaned on the rail and watched the brown water go about its business with a diligence that made a point about people. Families took pictures of themselves with the water doing what water always did in the back of it. Noor pointed at the gates and at the signs explaining them in the language of polite apocalypse. “Do you ever think we are just making neat sentences for weather?” she asked. “Like children writing ministers’ speeches for storms. Dear storm, please behave.”

“There is a comfort in pretending we can talk to it,” he said. “I like that someone built a door for the river. Even if the river is the owner.”

They bought ice-cream from a van whose music promised a childhood that never existed and sat with their knees at odds on a low wall. He told her about his father buying the cheap brass ring and about the moving sign. She told him about how her mother kept a jar of buttons and stitched good luck into the messed up tartan of their lives every time she had to move again. “Maybe we are all making everything hold,” she said. “Maybe that’s all education is. Stitches.”

They were both quiet for a while. Kids ran close and then away again like waves, and downriver a boat rounded itself out of the bright. Jaro put his hand on his sternum without thinking and felt the bland circle of the ring under his shirt like a friend who isn’t speaking at the moment but is there. He thought of all the circles he had met without naming them—the gasket in a pump, the flare of sun on the curve of a windshield, the way a laugh makes a mouth itself into a vowel. When he lay in bed that night, he thought, the world is full of ways back to itself.

Work got busy. The lorry with the jack-knife incident had a cousin with a timing belt disaster. A boy came in with his first car and a look like a person about to ask a favour from the wind, and the car held together because sometimes things do. The days stacked. He ran. He listened to the shipping forecast until the names became a way to test whether he was asleep. He wrote in the margins of the Sebald book until the margins begged him to find other paper. He stood at his window on an evening when the air tasted like rain and he watched the gulls slope inland like critics and thought, I am not done doing nothing, I am doing the first part of something.

Then a message came that was not a photograph, not a sentence cut by the motion of a deck, but a short, tidy note from a third person, the kind that is properly spelled and offers its own apology for existing. Hydrographic survey vessel Lysander has experienced mechanical issues and will be off comms until docking at Lowestoft Wednesday. All on board well. Communications intermittent. Please do not alarm. He read it three times. Noor forwarded it with three words—She’s fine, right?—and then followed with a sticker that was a ship with large eyes, because emojis are how you stitch feeling to texts when texts will not hold it.

He wrote back, She is fine, and then he went to his mother’s room and said, as if he had been asked, “I am going to Lowestoft.” His mother looked up from her book like a cat considering whether to allow a door to close. “You have work,” she said, and then, before he could argue, “Take Thursday off. You will not think about brake pads if your head is in a harbour. Take biscuits for the men on the boat. People who fix things always need biscuits.”

He took a coach because his car sounded like a list of things he didn’t want to admit yet and because the idea of watching lanes unspool without having to tend them felt like a small luxury. He put the ring on his finger in the coach toilet and panicked when it lodged for a second at the knuckle like a question asked too loudly in a small room, and then laughed at himself when a little soap and insistence made it turn like a good idea. Back in the seat, he held it again like it would accelerate time if he treated it like a clock.

Lowestoft presented itself as a man in a windproof coat who had a story about a storm for you whether you asked or not. The harbour smelled of diesel and old salt and of something sweet that he couldn’t place until he saw a stall selling doughnuts with sugar that might as well have been snow. The sea did the thing seas do on working coasts, which is to look like a workplace instead of a myth. He found the pier and then the place where the survey ships moored, and he waited the way you wait for a bus you are not sure runs on your side of town. The ring warmed with him and cooled when the wind bossed his jacket. He watched men coil ropes and curse them and then uncurl them again. A dog with one ear up and one ear down looked like a person who couldn’t decide whether to be sensible. Time did a trick with his eyes so that every boat far out was the boat he wanted until the boat was not.

She came in on a day that had no reason to be dramatic and so managed to be more so. The Lysander was smaller than it had been in his head and larger than it had been in her photographs. It came up the channel with the manageable swagger of a machine that works for a living. He stood, and then sat, and then stood again without meaning to, because his body did not care what seats were for at that moment. He could see figures on the deck rendered as punctuation marks: comma, hyphen, colon. When the boat made fast and the gangway went down, the crew came off like extras released from their scene. He did not recognise her at first because she had a hat and a face he did not know in the way that it was the same face made of awake and tired in different parts. Then he did recognise her because the way she looked around was the way she had looked into the classroom that first day, as if she could not quite believe she was meant to be the person standing there and had decided to be anyway.

He didn’t shout. He didn’t wave. He later thought he might have whispered, and that whisper had been enough because she turned and spotted him and she smiled a smile that had the shape of the lesson where she had said the word estuary with a softness that made it sound like an invitation. They stood facing one another with a rail between them and a man with a bollard between them and the knowledge between them that now something would have to be said.

“Lowestoft,” she said, and laughed a little, because sometimes the name of a place is good enough as a greeting.

“Lowestoft,” he said. “You look like the sea wrote you and then someone edited you kindly.”

“I smell like rope,” she said, which was true. “What are you doing here.”

“Not obeying a sign,” he said, and then, because she could hear the small seriousness under his joke, “I wanted to see you in from the line.” He paused, then added, “I have something for you.” He reached into his pocket and pulled out the ring wrapped in the piece of Sebald he had torn from the back and folded and folded until it was stiff as a card. He did not unwrap it because he knew that the unwrapping was part of the story and that stories should have their rituals. He held it out, and she took it with both hands, the way she had held his pages that time.

He watched her face with the greedy fairness of a person who has been lonely and is now allowed to be precise. She unwrapped the paper and the ring sat on her palm like itself, ugly and exact. She didn’t make an exclamation. She looked. Then she looked at him, and the look was one of those that people pretend not to exist because they do not have good names for them. He thought, she understands what this is, not as magic but as labour. He thought, she will tell the story correctly.

“You found it,” she said, and it wasn’t a question. “Or it found you. It has that look.” She turned it and saw the faint letter that couldn’t decide whether it was language. She laughed quietly, a private bell. “It has an eye. Of course it does. You know I—” She stopped and started again. “Thank you. Not for the object. For the impulse that let you pick it up, and for the walk in the mud, and for wanting to hand me a circle and see whether it fits any of my fingers.”

“You don’t have to wear it,” he said. “I know the stories about men marrying the sea. This is not a proposal. It is—” He looked down at his hands because they could sometimes translate him when words failed. “It is a way to hold a line until your own hand is free.”

“I will wear it,” she said, and the way she said it made it both a decision and a bet. “Perhaps not now. Perhaps in a moment when something needs a repetition. There is a thing we do—” She stopped and smiled, self-mockery softening the earnestness she could not help. “We drop small coins one by one when we pass certain markers. Not everyone, but some of us. For luck or for the dead or for the dead luck. We don’t tell each other. We look away. I will do that with this, perhaps. Or I will keep it in my pocket and let it argue with my keys.”

He wanted to ask to see her hands without gloves, to see where the rope had already written on her. He wanted to tell her that he had begun to write sentences that surprised him and that had her voice walking through them like a person checking doors. He wanted to say he had run along the estuary and felt faithful to something he could not quite name. Instead he asked, “Are you alright. The note made it sound—”

“We had an argument with a bearing,” she said lightly, because she was careful of the fears of people on land. “And the argument took longer than was polite. We sulked and then we apologised and then the engine forgave us. No drama beyond the drama of competence. The weather was good and badly behaved in the right proportion.”

They walked along the harbour wall to the stall with the doughnuts because he remembered his mother’s instruction across three distances: take biscuits. He bought a paper bag full because he liked the idea of giving the crew something that would feel like land. They leaned together in the little wind shadow of a shed and ate and let sugar fall on their coats like new snow. The gulls approved. She told him about a night when the boat moved in a way that made the whole crew swear in four languages and then break into the same laugh, because terror is kin to hilarity when nothing breaks. He told her about the boy with the metal detector and the ring’s eyed pattern and how the kid had promised him a Spanish kingdom. She told him the names the Norwegian had called the sea, names that sounded like affectionate insults. He told her the direction his mother’s moving sign had turned and turned. They did not say the name of the thing that moved between them because sometimes not naming was the way to protect the shape of it.

When she went back on board, he stood with his hands in his pockets and watched the little motions that make a departure: the same rope coiled, the same word called, the same gesture to the man on the quay. He felt the ring not on him, and the absence was not a loss so much as a lengthening. He thought, I have given away something that belongs to me in order to keep something else that I do not know how to keep. He stayed until the Lysander was a short sentence on the mouth of the harbour, and then he went to the bus station and fell asleep against the cool window with sugar still on his cuffs.

Back home, with the ring gone with her and his neck strangely light, he began to write as if someone had disassembled the tap in him and cleaned the grit out. He wrote about the rope burn across the palm of history. He wrote about the way men on the harbour made their bodies into shorthand for effort. He wrote about his grandmother’s ring and the absence of it and how absences can be more instructive than presences if you let them teach instead of mourn. He wrote a paragraph that astonished him and then embarrassed him and then convinced him, as if his own hand could be an adult he trusted. He read the shipping forecast and the names slotted into the lines like wrenches in their proper drawers.

The prize results came in a plain envelope with the college logo trying its best to look like an old university seal. He sat on the step to open it, because he was superstitious suddenly about receiving news inside as if it would stain. He did not win. He did not even come second. He was commended in that polite British way that implies both praise and a nudge toward the door where the winners were going to be. He laughed because the word commended is so well-behaved, and he folded the letter and stuck it under a magnet that had decided to be a lighthouse for the duration. He texted Noor, who replied, The judges are wrong and the world is wrong and you are a rightness that will persist until they notice, and then, more practically, Come to the pub and let me buy you a lemonade.

At the pub he drank lemonade the colour of childhood suns and listened to Noor tell him he was going to keep writing and then do a course that lasted longer than Thursdays and that she would bully him kindly into filling out forms. The man with the fleece said, “You got a ring yet,” meaning wedding and meaning life, because he was seventy and the world is a quiz at that age. Jaro said, “I gave it away,” and the man nodded as if that was the only correct answer and tipped his glass.

The weather turned from performing winter to rehearsing spring. Basildon did what it could with the light it was given. He ran along paths that were more appetite than route. He looked at the point on the wall where the letters lived and thought about other magnets. He began to make a map on his wall, not of places, but of words. He wrote THAMES in black pen just above his bed and then, with a ruler he found in the drawer with string and old keys, he drew lines to little notes that said, lighthouse magnet, moving sign, Noor’s button jar, doughnuts like snow. It looked ridiculous and necessary. He slept under it and felt like he was under constellations that would, if pressed, admit they were his.

One night, the voice on the radio, calm as ever, said the word gale twice and put numbers to it that were not comfort. He lay on his back with his hands under his head and counted breaths and then lost count and then started again. The message on his phone that came well after midnight was short and extravagant in the way news chooses to be at the wrong hour. Minor injury to crew. Docking at Grimsby for repair. Off grid seventy-two hours. All well. He stared at it and felt his body do that infuriating thing where it chooses the single word it will believe and shakes off the rest like a dog with too much water. The word it chose was injury. He got up and made tea because that is what his mother had taught him to do when the night turned its cards. He stood at the kitchen sink and held the mug and thought, I gave you a ring so that you would remember that circles return. Do not make me a liar. He did not pray, because the God he had glimpsed in the hard benches of churches and the soft lap of rivers was unpredictable and not the sort to deal in requests. He did something else that was older and more like the machines he loved; he made a promise out loud to the air that had heard worse and better, and said, If you bring her back, I will not waste what I have understood in this year. The room pressed on him like a hand, and then it let him go, and he went back upstairs and lay down and was not asleep but was not entirely not.

The morning did what mornings do after nights like that: it came anyway and brought toast and buses and the need to put on socks. He went to work and tightened bolts and adjusted things and listened to the mouth-noises of engines for treachery. At eleven, the boss’s girlfriend came in with a newspaper that had been folded and re-folded to the size of a docket and slapped it down. “Look,” she said. “They mentioned the boat on page four. No names. But a picture. It looks like a toy your nephew would see and immediately put in the bath.”

He looked. The picture was grainy and bright and showed the Lysander from an angle the sea had invented to make boats look surprised to find themselves in photographs. The caption was a small sentence that told him nothing he didn’t know. He traced the shape with his finger as if he could feel rope through newsprint. He folded the paper back to the size of a palm and put it in his pocket because he had begun to understand that some days demand you carry proof of something.

At dusk, when the town seemed to hold its breath before deciding whether to be kind for the evening, he walked out toward the garages by the sinks and looked at the sky like a person looking at a face they cannot read. Noor appeared from the laundry with a basket and a grin and said, “You look like a storm borrowed your head.” He told her the news and she said, “Then we will hold the other end of the string until it is tugged.” They stood there, two people with a basket and an empty pocket where a ring once pressed on skin, and the gulls, offended as ever, scythed overhead like commentary.

That night he slept in fragments and in one fragment he was in a corridor with a carpet patterned with anchors and the anchor pattern turned into a river and the river turned into a handwriting he could read and the handwriting said a sentence that felt like a person pressing a finger to his wrist. It said, Do not argue with the way back if it doesn’t choose you to lead. He woke and sat up and let the idea find a chair beside his bed. Then, because he had learned from women with hands that make tea what to do when the wide world presses in on the edges of a house, he went downstairs and put his hands on the table and waited for morning as if the table could speak sense at last.

When the message came, after the seventy-two hours and more, it was a photograph of a bruise on a hand and a caption that said, Prize: one scrap of purple. Then a paragraph, longer than it needed to be, full of details about a ladder and a misjudged wave and a humour that had sat on the chair next to pain and elbowed it. At the end she wrote, Your ring behaved. It reminded me of the shape of persistence. I have things to tell you about the bottom of the sea you love without seeing. And then, as if conceding something she had not wanted to name, I missed your voice doing that thing where you choose a word like you’re choosing a wrench and only then look to see whether it fits.

He went for a run that night and took the long way that became longer because the body sometimes wants to be a metronome for its own gladness. He ran past the estate playground, which smelled like damp plastic and memory, and past the garages where boys built engines and versions of themselves, and past the unambitious hedge that hid the education centre that had been a door in a wall. He ran until his breath did that neat alternating pattern with his feet that made all the sense people needed in a day. He ran back under the gulls and thought, The water will keep what the water owns, but sometimes it loans people to land for a while, and our job is to be a good borrow. He got home and stood with his hands on the sink and said, aloud to no one and to everyone, It begins again. He went to bed with the newspaper in his bag and the absence on his chest like a new kind of coin. He slept like a person who had been told a story he couldn’t yet repeat but knew he would.

The following week, the substitute teacher asked if anyone wanted to read aloud and Jaro did, not because he thought he should but because he wanted to hear a sentence come out of his mouth with all the edges on, and because when people are far and then are near again, you want to make bridges for them even when they do not yet see where they might step. He read beautifully and badly and Noor squeezed his arm once when he stumbled over a foreign name and that squeeze felt like a ring made of a finger. Afterward, he stood at the window and looked out at the hedges pretending to be important and thought, The ring is out at sea, and the story that is its size is growing. He thought of his mother’s moving sign and of the way his father had said the jacket wanted a different back and of how the word commended felt like a door being held for him. He thought, Začíná, and then, because it felt necessary to complicate faith with a human promise, he added, I will keep up.Chapter 4

By June, the town’s concrete warmed enough to be almost affectionate, heat lifting up off the pavements in a way that made even the gulls hesitate to commit to a landing. Basildon smelled like tar and washing powder and dry grass about to remember fire. The light stretched its hours like a shift you couldn’t argue with, and in the late evening the tower blocks put down long gentle shadows that made the car parks look briefly like parts of a plan. Jaro ran in the morning before the air got ideas, the ring’s absence a familiar weight that had become its own kind of presence. He timed his breath to the radio’s litany that had relocated itself in his head—Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, Humber, Thames—and laughed at himself once when he startled a fox and found he had apologised to it in a language he hadn’t used out loud in months.

He began to itemise his days as if an inventory might keep him from drifting. He worked, and work made sense, its small heroics honestly priced. He wrote in the evenings with the window open to let other people’s dinners and arguments drift in, and he lined his wall with paper that made the room look like it had been studying him. The map of words grew careful veins. In one corner he wrote the names of the shipping areas so precisely it calmed him, and from them he drew lines to parts of his own life he had not previously thought of as coastal. His mother stood in the door sometimes with a tea towel left to die on her shoulder like a flag and said, puzzlement and pride braided together, “It is good to see the inside of your head look like a room,” and he would say “Yes” and not tell her that sometimes the room looked like a harbour in fog.

A letter came with a crest that was trying its best not to look like clip art and told him he had been accepted onto a part-time creative writing certificate at Southend with a timetable that looked almost compassionate. He read it twice, then a third time, and only on the fourth did he allow the shape of a smile to become committed to his face. His mother put her hand on his cheek in a way she hadn’t since he’d had milk teeth and said, “You will have a paper with words that say you belong in a room where words happen,” and he kissed her hand, awkward and earnest, and told himself he would find hours under hours. At work, the boss pretended to be gruff because that was his role in the play—that thing with the writing, does it pay?—and the boss’s girlfriend took him by the shoulders and shook him once as if testing whether he was awake. “You will buy a tote bag and put your books in it and look insufferably interesting at a bus stop,” she said. “It is required.”

Lorna wrote from a port whose name looked like a misprint and said they would be docking in Harwich for a week of checks and rest and something she called the patience of experts. She would come down to Leigh for a small event the heritage centre had agreed to host because, as her email said, people like to look at bones and buoys and anything that lets them feel time as an object. She made a joke about posters and cold coffee and the smell of rope in an indoor space. She added, almost as an afterthought that wasn’t an afterthought, Bring Noor. Bring anyone who wants a reason to look at water without needing to buy chips first.

The evening of the talk, the estuary behaved like a stage hand: grey cloth, changeable light, a wind polite enough to add atmosphere rather than sabotage. The heritage centre was one of those buildings that seemed perpetually relieved to be loved, its glass clean enough to make people notice their own faces and make arrangements with them before going in. There were photographs of men holding up fish with expressions that refused to be read as exactly pride and a case full of brass things that had been useful once and were still beautiful now. On a table near the back, there was a spread of biscuits like a small treaty with attention spans.

People gathered with that particular local mixture of curiosity and the right to be unimpressed. Noor arrived ten minutes early because she always did when something mattered, wrapped in a scarf that made the room look like it needed to work to match her. She squeezed his arm and whispered, “Does your heart make that noise always or is it just today,” and he smiled with his mouth and his eyes both because she was one of the only people he knew who deserved that.

Lorna came in like people do when they have been on something that moves and must now practice stillness again. She looked very much like herself and also like a person who had been introduced to nights and been accepted by them. The ring he had given her hung on a chain at her throat, dull and deliberate, and when she moved, it rolled slightly like an eye managing not to blink. She wore her watch with its face on the inside of her wrist, and he thought briefly and ridiculously about wrists as harbours. When she saw them—Noor’s blaze, his careful ordinary—her mouth lifted on one side in that way he had noticed and made into a small private compass. She did not make a scene. She said hello like a person who was in the habit of making rooms act kindly.

The talk was more about listening than telling. She showed slides of sonar readouts that looked like lost alphabets and photographs of hands doing things people would rather not think hands have to do. She talked about the bottom as a place with its own weather and its own forgetfulness, the way silt made a democracy of what it took, the slow politics of shoals. She spoke about tokens found and tokens invented: clay pipes that had learned the shape of the river’s patience, a child’s toy car that had ended up two miles from any road like a joke and a warning, a coin pierced to hang that told a story only about the person who had pierced it. And then she held up two rings and let the room draw its own neat intake of breath.

“This,” she said, “belonged to my grandmother for longer than it belonged to the person it was meant for. It came up in a trawl one day along with a lot of ordinary and a few bits of extraordinary, and she kept it in a drawer and then in stories, which is often how these things live best. And this,” she continued, raising the other, “came to me because someone did a very old-fashioned thing and followed a line on a map with his feet.” She did not look at him while she said it, and he loved her a little more for the way she protected the privacy of courage in public.

The rings were not exactly twins, but they had learned the same alphabet. The little waves were there, the eye-shape that might have been an eye or might have been the almond of a saint if saints had worn brass, and inside each a faint letter that refused to confess itself entirely. In one, the suggestion of an M. In the other, something that might be the ghost of the same letter flipped and rubbed by years and pockets and water, the letter you get if you draw an M without taking your pencil off the page. People pressed forward with that reverent lightness groups acquire around objects that might give them a story to take home and tell someone who had decided not to come.

A man with a beard that had decided to expand in retirement asked whether they were wedding rings, and Lorna smiled the way she smiled when people asked the sort of questions that made a room generous. “If they were, the marriage they signified had to learn to be very patient,” she said. “People talk about sailors and rings and death and debt because narrative wants an ending it can remember. My grandmother said it was a charm ring, which is a way of saying it is an engine for hope that can be disguised as metal. There are marks here—” she held the older ring against the glass like a moon—“that come from hands. Hands leave themselves in metal. The place where the finger presses with its own small weather. That’s what I like most: that you can see a human lesson in a circle.”

After, in the noise of people being pleased with their own attendance, they stood by the door where the wind could look in if it wanted to. Noor deployed her praise like a person adept with tools. “You made science sound like a promise and story sound like a measurement,” she said. “That is a neat trick.” Lorna laughed and said it was mostly pretending to be sensible in a room full of people who were better at being sensible than she was.

Jaro held the newer ring in his hand for a second because she put it there as naturally as if there had been no other place for it to go. It had warmed to her. He felt the wear of it like concentration. “It was a good crewman,” she said low enough that it was privacy and not theatre. “I watched it more than once look at the horizon for me when my hands were busy. There was a night—” She glanced at the wall as if the wall might keep this for them—“when we crossed a stretch where the soundings were honest but thin and the wind decided to see how many tricks it knew. It clicked against the rail at the same instant the monitor drew a line that told me to trust the numbers and not the fear. I do not believe in magic. I believe in the company of objects that have earned their place. This—” she nodded at the ring—“has done its time as company.”

They walked along the seawall after the room let them go, the water at that hour doing its handsome trick of pretending to allow itself to be blue. There were boys launching themselves off a low jetty with preposterous bravery and fathers pretending they weren’t counting heads with every splash. She described the way a certain harbour light in the upper north made a shape on the black that taught her a new kind of faith. He told her about the acceptance letter and about the part of him that worried that learning to name what he loved might kill some of its muscle. She told him that naming, done with care, is a way of giving air, not of cutting. He told her about the map on his wall and the line from THAMES to the lighthouse magnet, and how sometimes the magnets fought with each other and then made up like teenagers. She laughed with her mouth and her shoulders both and said, “I would like to see that one day, if time ever decides to be a benevolent person.”

They didn’t talk about feelings the way people in bad books do, because neither of them wanted to disappoint the words they had begun to trust. But they did stand very close when the wind lifted her hair off her neck and then let it settle and he could see the place where the pulse tells a story, and that was dangerous enough and kind enough for the hour.

The next day, as if the world wanted to balance grace with administration, a small padded envelope arrived at the house with no return name. Inside was a fishing licence that had expired in 1998 and a ring made of brass that had no pattern beyond the memory of fingers and a note on paper that looked like it had been in a wallet for too long. The note said simply, Found this at a boot fair in Basildon. Your mum said it might be yours. I am the man with the crown tattoo who talked too much about carburettors. The ring is a silly thing. You will know whether it belongs to you. It smells like old number two oil and stories. It was his father’s ring. He knew it because it was useless and because of the dent inside where his father had once said a door had made a point with him and had left a sermon in metal. He took it to the kitchen where his mother was making a soup that wanted to be more than itself and put it on the table and let the table do its old job of keeping this house honest.

She sat down and looked at it like a person looks at a face in a photograph when they are trying to place the exact day it was taken. Then she laughed with no sound, just the breathless curl of it. “It came back,” she said. “It came back because it wanted to be where it could overhear our talk. That’s what it always wanted.” She didn’t put it on. She took his wrist and turned it in her hand and held both rings briefly pressed between them and said, “There is a logic. Maybe not one we can write down without lying, but there is.”

For a week, his life felt full of circles trying to be responsible to one another. He wore his father’s ring on a string like he had the other, and the different weight made his chest aware of itself in a way that steadied him. He took the ring that had been his grandmother’s sister’s brother’s cousin’s—he had lost the exact diagram of the relation but not the respect—and put it in the bowl by his bed with his keys. He thought about what Lorna had said—company—and he resolved to be careful about what he brought near him and what he left to be lonely.

He went to work and found he saw the roundness in everything. The brake discs, the gaskets, the threaded mouths of bolts, the way light made a lens of a drop of oil on the floor. Ben from tyres brought in a child’s bicycle wheel that had bent itself into a question mark and asked whether it could be answered, and Jaro undid the tyre and worked slowly with both hands like an apology and at the end the wheel sat up properly and that felt like a parable that did not need to admit it was one. The boy with the metal detector came by with a pocket full of interesting things that the adult world refused to value, and together they made a list of the rules of looking which turned out to be rules for other kinds of attention as well: go slow enough to be bored; when bored, keep going; when you think you see, do not shout at it; become friendly with failure.

On a Monday when the weather flirted with rain and then decided not to commit, he went to Southend to find the building where he would be a person with a timetable. The campus had that makeshift quality he had come to trust—new glass next to old brick, a sign that had been corrected with a sticker, a bench that kept the impression of the last person to have been deliberate on it. He sat in a cafe with his acceptance letter folded into something like an origami heart by an inattentive hour and watched the students perform their various invulnerabilities and felt happily older than them and also unaccountably allied. He took out a notebook and wrote ten sentences that began with the words I will and nine sentences that began with the words I won’t and felt ridiculous and practical in equal measure.

The last day of the Harwich week, he met Lorna at a cafe that had decided to be austere for reasons of fashion and served a coffee that tasted like someone had thought very hard about it before pouring. She took off the chain and put the ring on the table with a care that could be read as reverence and could also be read as habit. Then, with no drama and a kindness that felt like the opposite of a dare, she slid the classroom ring toward him. “Keep this for me,” she said. “I will sign it out to you with no receipt, because the receipt would make it feel like it could prove itself by paper. Keep it in a bowl with your keys. Keep it in your pocket when you think you might be asked to be brave. Do not throw it anywhere, even in a spirit of poetry. We will swap currents.”

It felt like a ceremony that required a third person to witness and an old person to bless, but there was only the barista who had decided they were studying and was careful to make no noise near their table. He reached out and closed his hand around the older ring and felt the small burr where the pattern had started to surrender. He thought about responsibility in the shape of a circle. He tried to imagine the line that had just been drawn between sea and land, between a boat with a name old enough to have seen loneliness and a kitchen where the radio told jokes it didn’t believe. He put the ring in his pocket next to the travel card and the receipt for doughnuts he had not thrown away and he felt that particular weight that made walking a deliberate act.

“Do you ever feel,” he said, “that if you look at a thing too long you will turn it into a religion by accident.”

“All the time,” she said, and her smile made the thought less anxious. “The trick is to let the thing be stubborn and small at once. Let it refuse to be a symbol when you are tired and let it be a help when you are hungry. We are not priests. We are only people with our hands out, asking to hold something that tells us how to keep going.”

He wanted to say something that would acknowledge the shape of what they were building between them without asking it to be anything other than the right size. He said, “When you go, I will listen to the forecast and pretend it is a letter you sent me because you had run out of words,” and she nodded as if that was not a bad system. Then she did a thing that would be nothing if written down and everything if remembered: she reached out and with her forefinger touched the place on the chain where the ring had lived, as if telling her neck to miss it on purpose, and then she touched the table where the other ring had been and left, briefly, the warmth of her skin there and then took it away.

When she left for the ship again, she did it like a person who had learned from all her departures and had resolved to make them short and clear. He walked with her to the station and they stood by the sign that told people their trains had been reduced to codes. She put her hand on his sleeve for exactly the second required to send a message that would not embarrass them later and said, “Keep up,” which was also what he had promised himself in the kitchen that night when the radio had been so sensible and the news had been so not. He said, “Come back,” because some sentences are allowed to be less sophisticated than others, and she smiled and said, “I will, unless the sea hires me longer than the contract allows.”

He went home and put the classroom ring in the bowl with the keys, and for the first time the bowl looked properly like a bowl for the lives of a house instead of a place they put their laziness. He stood there with the radio off and felt how quiet is sometimes the strongest sound. He began then what he understood, later, was a new part of his faith: he sat at the table each night with the ring beside his hand and wrote until the quiet confessed it wasn’t empty. The sentences did not always behave, but they arrived like a tide that doesn’t need to be liked to be believed. He wrote about the way people apologise to water when they fall in, as if falling had offended a code. He wrote about the sound ropes make when they are about to do a difficult thing and know it. He wrote about his father’s ring dent and the apology it must have accepted, and then he wrote a line that made him put down his pen and get up and walk to the window and stand there until night had insisted fully. He wrote, Some objects witness us until we are legible, and then hand us back to ourselves with our names written in a script we recognise.

There were days when the world would not allow itself to be about rings. Days when a car refused to confess its spark plug problem because the sound it made was the kind you only admit to in private. Days when his mother’s knee had ideas of its own and he had to go to the chemist and then to the shop with the tinned pears she liked and carry back a bag that made his fingers decide they were not made merely for pens. He liked those days too, because they kept him honest and because there is something to be said for being so useful you forget you are complicated. Noor came over with a sheaf of forms and bullied him kindly into filling out the one about student finance and the one about time and the one that wanted to know who he would be in three years. He wrote, someone who knows how to keep a small promise, because it seemed the only truthful reply.

The shipping forecast did its weather prayers and he did his human ones, which were the same thing said from a different room. At the edge of sleep, he heard them both and, sometimes, if he lay very still, the voice that was neither and both—a woman with a chalky hand and a boat under her feet—came in and set its quiet on the table between them, and he saw very clearly the circle of it and did not make an altar out of it and did not fail to light a candle with the palm of his hand.Chapter 6

By July the heat had decided it wanted a proper argument and the town obliged, radiators masquerading as pavements and the sky stretched taut like canvas. Basildon learned the high note of lawnmowers and low note of fans and the gulls became bureaucrats, invading where the rules were weakest. Jaro ran earlier, cutting his route so he would pass under the same three sycamores at the same minute and get their shade as a predictable gift. The ring from the classroom lived now in the bowl by the keys and made a small sound at night when he dropped change; it wasn’t a chime so much as a dull acknowledgement, an instrument praising the ordinary. He liked knowing it was there without touching it. He liked the way absence could be made specific and domestic.

Southend asked him for a library card photograph, and the camera in the student office gave him a face he mostly recognised and a number that felt irresponsibly permanent. The course began not with a lecture but with a writing exercise that looked stupid on paper and turned out to be vital when it came out of his hands. Write your river, the tutor said, a woman with grey hair cut to behave and a pencil that had been sharpened to a threat. Do not name it. Do not tell me its length. Tell me how it gets under your life. He wrote in a hand that had learned not to invite attention, but the words made their own permission, a list that was not a list, the river as ache and as inventory: bolts rinsed in it, a cousin’s swear in it, a gull’s legal case. When he read aloud, he stumbled over a Czech word he thought he had translated in time and he didn’t apologise because he had learned not to, and a man two seats down with a voice like fish hooks said, “Keep the foreign. It’s not foreign if it’s the truth that taught you the sentence.” The room had that collective intake of breath that happens when a cheap chair suddenly becomes a pew.

He began to build a small life at the university that did not cancel his other life so much as braid with it. He liked the cafe that served toast like it had been negotiated and the girl behind the till who wrote people’s names in capitals no matter what age their mouths were. He liked the noticeboard that offered guitarists and catsitting and rooms that insisted on being called studios. He liked the tutor’s habit of closing her eyes for half a second before answering a question, as if aligning something inside before speaking it. He liked how Noor visited once and behaved like she had been there all along, her scarf a flag that made the corridor seem temporarily trustworthy. The work came in packets that didn’t look like work until he was halfway through doing them, and the days at the garage shaped themselves around new words like metal left in the sun yields to hands.

Lorna wrote when the sea allowed her its postage. The ring he had found hung on her chain in photographs as if it had been intended for the specific geography of her throat, an ugly little eye against the salt-silver of a collarbone. She sent a picture of a chart covered in numbers that pretended to be a picture, and the email said, We are drawing the bottoms of places men cross as if angry with the distance. The ring clicks against the rail sometimes when we are doing patient work and I am tired enough to want to entertain the idea that it knows when to speak. Last night a shoal changed its mind while we were watching it. I am too in love with the idea of water to be scientific in the way they train us, but even the practical men here have a superstition folded into their pockets with their knives. They pretend not. It’s sweet.

At home, his mother’s knee staged its own private mutiny and he took her to the surgery with its posters about drinking water and counting breaths. The waiting room smelled like old toast and disinfectant’s idea of lemon. A man with a scar the shape of a small continent on his cheek looked at Jaro’s hands the way men who fix things identify their own. “You’re the boy from the A132 shop,” he said without embarrassment, like naming a cloud. “ Did a clutch for my nephew. You have patience. I knew a man once with that exact patience, only he squandered it, the idiot. Worked out of Tilbury on and off. Laugh like he’d been given the choice to be a lighthouse and chose to be the electricity instead. Used to wear a ring that made his finger look like it was proud of itself.” The world can be very rude when it decides to line things up. Jaro kept his face in its well-behaved configuration and asked what you ask when names run too close to home. “Do you know his name,” he said. “Do you know if he still—” The man did that British thing of looking at the floor as if it were the one who had promised to know. “Czech bloke,” he said. “Name in my mouth wrong. Tall, hair that always looked rained on even in July. Used to say he was married to roads and then he went and courted the river. He was good until he wasn’t. I remember his laugh. I remember him lighting a cigarette only when the wind disapproved. He might be on a dredger out of Erith if he’s anywhere. Or he’s the type that changes jobs like shirts. Sorry, son. That’s all the map I have.” Jaro nodded because the body needed somewhere to put the information before the heart would be ready. His mother squeezed his wrist in a way that said later, and in the car she let silence set its chair upright.

It would have been easy to call the number that the man at the surgery later left at the garage, a number that smelled like diesel and rumours. It would have been harder to not call it and pretend that restraint was the same thing as patience. He put it under the lighthouse magnet and watched it for a day as if it might move on its own if it wanted to be the right thing. That night, the shipping forecast read its list and he repeated the names not like prayer, not like a challenge, but like a roll call of all the possible rooms his father might have entered. Humber, Thames, Dover. He wrote a letter instead of making a call. It felt almost antique in his hands, paper and ink and a woman’s pen that made his handwriting honest. He didn’t put a return address. He didn’t ask questions with marks; he asked them with stories. He wrote about a cheap ring and a good jacket and how you can want to be electricity and also need somewhere to plug in. He wrote about a boy with a magnet in his stomach and a town that had learned what it could do with grey. He folded the letter and took it to the post office and watched the woman weigh it as if he had placed a muscle on her scales. He walked home with emptier hands and steadier legs.

At Southend, the tutor set an assignment called Witness, which made half the room groan because the word had been misused by sermons and television. The instruction was simple enough to be ruthless. Attend a small thing fully. Report without flattering yourself. He stood in the garage after hours and watched how oil migrates down the spine of an engine that has forgotten its promises and how light makes a wheel nut important and then irrelevant in the time it takes for a cloud to make an opinion. He wrote about the way Ben from tyres crackled a wrapper open with exaggerated ceremony because he had quit smoking and needed to make rituals out of unimportant things. He wrote about his mother cutting the pepper off her portion of dinner because it made her knee feel shown up. He wrote about how the ring in the bowl made his keys decide to lie flat. In the workshop an older woman named Maureen who had worked as a midwife for thirty years said his sentences made her see the inside of machines as anatomy, and he loved her for the way she had bridged the gap with no fuss.

The day the Thames Barrier closed for practice, his phone lit up with people who wanted to be the kind of person who noticed it. Noor sent a picture of herself in a bus reflected in the glass of a shop window with the headline scrolling along the bottom of a television inside: BARRIER TEST—ESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE. He rode out there after work because the light had decided to do that late-July thing that makes everyone act like they have forgiven the city for most of its habits. The gates lifted like slow grammar, beautiful because they refused to hurry. He stood with a handful of other people who were there for the same reason as him and for other reasons they would not admit, and he watched a river agree, briefly, to a set of human terms and then resume its sentence, unbothered. He texted Lorna a photograph and made the caption an explanation: Practicing our doors. She replied hours later with a view of open water that looked like a sheet someone had tried to fold and given up on and wrote, Practicing our maps.

There are days when a town becomes a chorus and no one has to be told their line. The heritage centre asked him and Noor to read at a small evening that called itself a Salon because everything wants to dress up if you let it. The boss’s girlfriend made a poster with his name on it and the font did its best not to look embarrassed. He wore a clean shirt and his mother said “Fine” in a way that meant she had cried earlier and would not now. Noor went first and read a piece that sounded like what a city says to women when it thinks no one is listening, and people took in their breath between their teeth and applauded like their palms were saying “yes, yes.” He read his river with the foreign word left shining in the middle like a coin, and read the part about rings without saying ring, and when he sat down his legs tried to be clever and failed and he forgave them. Lorna wasn’t there and that was correct; the sea had her and the schedule had her and the act of reading was not for the moment of being seen but for the practice of being precise. Still, the next morning there was an email with a subject that had no words, just a small circle, and inside she wrote, I imagined the sound of the room when you placed that coin and I held the chain so it wouldn’t go on without me, which is miraculous, considering it is indifferent metal. You made a door for me with your voice in a place I could not go. That is not a small thing.

On the Lysander, the ring clicked twice in a movement Lorna would never say out loud was anything more than coincidence. They were mapping a shapelessness that someone had given a number because numbers make men less nervous, and the bottom pretended to rise and then pretended to fall and the monitor drew a new story at the speed of a slow heartbeat. Later, in the galley, she held the chain and the ring together until they were warm and the cook rolled his eyes in the way of kind men who smoke when the weather lets them and otherwise take the piss out of magic on principle. “If you start naming the waves, I’m getting off,” he said, and she said she had already named the waves and they had behaved, and they both laughed in the respectful way people laugh at superstitions when they have been saved by worse.

A week later a small padded parcel came addressed in a handwriting that made each letter try to be the kind of person you could invite into your house. Inside was a short spanner, the good kind, with weight a hand trusts, and a note from his father that did not name itself as such. I do not know if I am writing to you or to the version you keep of me, it began, which was, Jaro admitted to himself with pleasure that made him angry, exactly the kind of sentence he would write. The note told him not about absence but about work: about mud that made the whole machine sound like someone chewing; about how in certain light you could read the river from the bank by its texture; about how some men call a dredger a monster and some call it a broom and neither is right; about the way metal remembers the hands that have hit it wrong and correct. There was a line about a ring that had been gone longer than it had been owned and that had, once, returned by accident to a market where a man had no business being and had thus recovered itself like a dog that cannot resist the thought of its own yard. The note asked nothing. It ended with a drawing of a small circle, like the one in Lorna’s email, and under it, written like an afterthought and an oath, the word Dobře.

He took the spanner to work and used it as if it had no story and that felt like the most respectful thing he could do. He did not tell his mother at once; he put the letter in the bowl with the ring and let the two pieces of stubborn rest together. That night he told the kitchen table what had happened in the way of people who have no gods exactly but have habits that listen, and his mother came in and watched him the way you check a tyre for a nail and then she sat and put her hand over his hand and the spanner under both and said, “Good,” and that was enough for the hour. Later, she took the letter and read it alone, because there are some bridges mothers must cross without an audience.

Work turned as it does when weather announces itself with scented threats, sudden storms that come up like jokes told without warning. The day the A13 drowned itself for the afternoon, three people brought in cars that had attempted to be boats and failed, and Jaro drained a Polo with more tenderness than language. He watched water come out of the belly of a machine like sorrow being coaxed into sense, and he felt oddly instructed by it. At home, he put a towel by the bowl because the ring came in damp from his pocket and he wanted to offer it the decency of a dry place. He didn’t tell anyone how carefully he dried that dull circle, using the edge of a shirt that had been ironed with attention, and that is exactly the kind of thing a life consists of.

The substitute teacher at the adult centre, who had become a presence rather than a stand-in without anyone pronouncing it, announced that he would take them out to the marshes with a historian who knew the stories of walls and water in a way that made them feel not guilty but implicated. Jaro went because he said yes to sentences he wouldn’t have said yes to last year. The day was the kind that looks plain in photographs and is everything in the body, wind arguing respectfully, grass lying down and getting up on cue. The historian pointed with a stick at lines that were not lines until he named them and spoke about reclamation as if the word’s politeness could not hide the fact that it was theft with mathematics. “The sea remembers,” he said, and smiled as if he knew what that sentence could do in a mouth that loved the idea more than the fact. Jaro walked behind the group and picked up a fragment of blue-and-white ceramic that had the arrogance to still be pretty, and he put it in his pocket with the ring because it seemed correct that things that had waited should ride together for a while.

That night he dreamed not of water or of machines but of chalk, the old blackboard and the careful arc of a hand drawing the coastline of a map that no one would ever agree about. He woke with the smell of chalk in his head and the detail nailed to the afternoon: Lorna’s hair at the nape of her neck when she was writing, the small ridiculous holiness of it. The phone buzzed with a picture of a forearm with a new bruise arranged like a solar system and a caption, Whales are the best liars. He didn’t need to know the story to understand the tone of it. He wrote back a list of five names of boats he had seen out of Southend that week and let the list be a poem. She replied with the line, There is a man here who sings to the paint so it will dry kind, and that was enough to keep him honest through the morning.

On a Sunday Noor came over with lemons she didn’t know what to do with and ended up staying until the day put its pyjamas on. They sat with the windows open to the neighbour’s programme about hauntings and talked about futures as if they were poorly behaved pets. Noor confessed she had applied for a job in a library in town and had been shocked to be offered it and then more shocked to discover she wanted it. “I thought I was made for movement,” she said, peeling a lemon like a skill test. “It turns out I might be made for the kind of stillness that sees everything.” He told her about the letter and the spanner and she made the face she made when she didn’t know whether to be glad or to be mad on his behalf on a schedule. “You will meet him,” she said, as if it were a policy decision. “You will meet him when you can shake his hand without wanting to break it first. We will plan for that version. In the meantime, be as well as possible for when that day insists.”

The Lysander turned for a different portion of the coast and the messages thinned down to the essential because the sea had decided to be interesting. When she wrote, her sentences came out like crew orders disguised as domestic chat. Wind backing, she wrote, cold to the bone but in a way that makes you grateful to feel made of anything. Ring being rude, clicking in unhelpful places, suspicious of the idea of sleep. Found a scrap of net that had memorised a gull and refused to forget it. I have a new way of listening to the bottom; will tell you over chips if the universe remembers who owes who.

He went on a Tuesday to the railway bridge that looked over the mudflats and watched the tide run out as if it had a bus to catch. An old man smoked three cigarettes with the care of someone rationing an argument with himself and told Jaro in that unasked way that certain lengths of rope learn knots faster than others and that was to do with the rope’s childhood. “You can hear it,” he said. “You can tell when a line will betray you and when it won’t. Same with people. It’s all to do with how they’ve been braided.” Jaro nodded and put the observation in his pocket like a flint.

At the university, he wrote a scene that surprised him with its heat and then embarrassed him with its accuracy and he didn’t delete it because he had promised himself he would stop saving the world from his sincerity. The tutor wrote in the margin, You are letting the sentence do more of the heavy lifting now, good, and he felt the kind of pride that makes men lie about the size of fish, except he didn’t lie. He took the bus home with his tote bag making the exact face the boss’s girlfriend had predicted and he caught his reflection in the window and did not hate it. He went for a run past the education centre and the hedge seemed less unambitious than it had when they had first met it. He found himself slowing by the door without wanting to go in and he stood a second, long enough to choose that he was not the same person who had sat in the back to maximise escapes and that familiarity was not a trap but a story you get to continue.

In August a storm that had been given a name like a politician threw a tantrum over the North Sea. The forecast’s calm said the numbers twice and added caution, with a neutrality that made alarm bells sound impolite. He watched the isobars on the news like a mechanic examining a belt that is asking politely to leave a job it has done too long. Then his phone went dark, not because the power failed but because the message had not yet been allowed to be sent. He didn’t panic in the vulgar way; he did the useful things, the oils and the bread and the checking of torches, and he sat with his mother and watched the afternoon make choices. Noor came over with biscuits because it is impossible for her not to feed fear and because the good biscuits are a kind of strategy. They put the bowl with the ring on the table like a centre of gravity.

When the message arrived it was three lines that made the kitchen seem as important as a bridge. Owed you chips. Wind disagrees. Small injury elsewhere but competence is a tide. I remembered once standing by a hedge and you saying water has a memory, and it seemed important to hold that line hard. He read it aloud, and his mother shook her head and said a sentence not influenced by translation, “We don’t deserve these brave women,” and Noor said, “We do as long as we are kind back,” and that felt like an achievable religion.

After the storm the light did that post-argument thing of being clearer than usual, the air admitting it had been wrong about something and would do better. The Lysander’s next photograph made it to him with half the pixels missing and that made it look even more honest. The ring on the chain glinted like a small punctuation. He wrote back with a picture of the bowl at home and the classroom ring inside it and the lighthouse magnet beside and he captioned it, Harbour. She wrote, A good borrow, and that phrase became a polish on the day.

The meeting with his father did not happen because life decided to be merciful and make him earn it by not chasing it with a stick. It happened as a function of errands. He took a delivery to a yard near Erith because the boss had misread a date and someone had to be the apology in a van. The river at that bend was made of industry rather than story and it suited him fine that afternoon. He backed the van up to a stack of crates that still smelled of their tree days and a man shouted cheerfully at him as if they had been neighbours for years. When it came, he did not slow it down with hope or speed it up with dread; he got out of the van and there was his father, older in the way that men get older when their work is outside, hair doing its rain trick in sunshine, a face that was his but written in another hand. The ring was not on his finger and that was right. The laugh was exactly as the man in the surgery had described it and that was infuriating and immediate. They said each other’s names and then they said the weather because that is the scaffolding under hard talk. Then they shook hands and it felt like the spanner made sense.

They did not pretend the long decade had been a misunderstanding or that pain was a clerical error. They stood in the lee of a shed and told each other work stories because that is what men who have hurt each other say when they are building a bridge with available materials. His father asked about the course and his mother and the bowl by the door because he had remembered enough to know that such bowls exist, and Jaro asked about dredgers and nights and the ridiculous heroics of rope. His father apologised once, and it was not ornate and not insufficient; it was a word put down like a tool in the right place. They arranged to see each other again without arranging a moral conclusion, and when Jaro drove back along the long low road that loves trucks, he felt aired out in a way that left him tired and almost simple. At home, he put his hands on the kitchen table and his mother looked at his face and then at his hands and said, “Dobře,” and he laughed and cried in the proportion the body chose and the house became a room a little larger.

The next week, he stood in his own small room with the windows open and wrote as if writing was not a special act but the continuation of breathing. He wrote about the way the river as an idea had finally put a hand on the back of his neck and steadied him into adulthood. He wrote about the ring in the bowl and the ring at sea and the ring on the string under his shirt and how he had, without drama, become a person with three circles and three kinds of responsibility. He wrote about the way people forgive not because it is noble but because carrying the opposite is heavy and messy and bad for wrists. He wrote about the names on the radio and how they were simply the sea letting the land feel included. He wrote like a person keeping up.

When Lorna came back downriver for a weekend that had been rationed into it by clever planning and a boss who had been young once, they stood on the seawall in the late afternoon while the tide and the town negotiated. She wore the ring he had found as if it had been engineered to rest at that exact measure above her sternum, and he wore the string under his shirt like a sentence he would say one day to someone who had earned the right to hear it. They did not use big words they were not ready to feed; they said things like, It is good to see you with the weather on your face, and, I like that you tightened that wheel for that woman as if the world might fall off if you didn’t, and they let their shoulders touch like a right answer.

“Do you ever think about letting the ring go,” he asked, because there was time that evening to be risky.

“I promised it something when I was very tired and didn’t know it,” she said, smiling at her honesty as if it were a houseplant making the effort. “I promised it I would not let it carry more story than it could hold. I will keep that promise. And I am thinking—” she took the chain in her fingers like a tolerant god—“that perhaps when we finish this run and I am ashore long enough to remember what sleep is, we will take both rings and give them one day in the sun together. We will see whether they speak to each other when they are not being watched. And then we will put them back where they do their best work, which is near hands.”

They walked to the old cockle sheds because people who have made big decisions often like to buy very ordinary food at the end of it. They ate chips with too much vinegar because some extravagance is cheap. She told him about a false seabed and the politics of shoals and the way men refuse to believe instruments when their pride has just been nicked. He told her about a spanner and a man with hair that refused to obey and the way a hand can apologise to another hand without staging the word. They were careful with each other’s stories in a way that precluded catastrophe. On the way back, a boy launched himself from the small jetty with a holler that made the gulls complain, and both of them laughed for the same reason without having to say it, which was that joy often arrives with no slipway.

That night, the ring in the bowl by the door and the ring on her chain and the ring on his string existed in a small triangle of patience over which the house threw its ordinary noises. The radio was low enough not to dictate. The tea went cold in a way that made it possible to drink more. The sentences he and she would write later about the evening were already pulling up chairs like friends who know they are welcome. And when it rained for a few minutes and then stopped, the drops on the window made circles that fattened and slipped and left trails like a map no one could keep, and it did not feel like a symbol so much as a simple truth about water and glass and gravity, a demonstration of what it looks like when things return to their shape without fuss.Chapter 8

September arrived with the light tilting, the sun stepping back just enough for the edges of things to be seen without flinching. Basildon cooled to a sensible temperature and the nights stopped smelling like blown fuses. The town lost the high note of lawnmowers and gained the quiet industry of people trying to find jumpers that hadn’t consented to live in charity bags yet. Jaro ran under a sky that had turned the precise grey of a decent pencil and felt the steadiness of the season like a hand at the small of his back. The map on his wall had multiplied its lines until the word THAMES sat at the centre like a patient planet. The ring from the classroom lived in the bowl by the door with that particular gravitas certain objects acquire when given a little ceremony and a steady address. He had stopped checking for it with a glance every time he came home; he knew it was there without bullying himself with proof, which felt like progress of a kind he could respect.

The course at Southend became a rhythm that did not compete with the garage so much as lend it a bass line. He learned the café’s busy hours and how to occupy a corner of the library without intruding on the quiet territories of people who had been practising stillness for longer than him. He discovered that there are pens that make sentences come out with fewer apologies and that paper can sometimes behave better if you don’t look it full in the face when you begin. A new tutor with a voice that made commas feel wanted set them a task called Attention and embarrassed them into doing it well. He wrote a page about a man crossing the workshop to borrow a tool he already owned because he didn’t want to disturb where it had settled, and the tutor said the very simple sentence, “Yes, that is a truth,” and underlined nothing, which felt like respect disguised as restraint.

Noor started at the library in a cardigan that took the job of shoulders seriously and a lanyard that made her roll her eyes even while she wore it. She stood under a sign that declared itself a policy and laughed up at it the way she laughed at weather that overpromised. “I am learning the grammar of spines,” she said after her first day, bringing over a bag heavy with leaflets and the smell of paper that had been cut with calm. “Dewey thinks the world is an argument that can be numbered, which is both funny and terrifying. Come sit in the local history room with me. It’s like the inside of a clock.” They went together on a Wednesday morning when the town was pretending to be at work and were given a table under a window that had made peace with its own draft. Noor fetched boxes that had labels written in the handwriting of retired precision and they opened them like drawers in a chest inherited from a house you don’t remember. There were photographs of boats that had been someone’s heartbeat for forty years and then someone else’s ashtray and then finally a caption. There were clippings about small disasters and smaller triumphs, and a ledger with names that looked like a list of characters who refused to proceed into scenes.

The rings came out in conversation the way people do when they’ve been waiting politely for an invitation. Noor opened a file with a tab that said Trinity House Correspondence and found a letter arguing about the correct colour of a buoy, the sort of letter two men write when they cannot safely say what they are really arguing about. Then she found a notice about a trawler that had not returned in 1932 and a list of names that had been cut out and stuck down in era-appropriate glue that had outlived several marriages. There was a Marek among them: a second name in a list on a page that made its way too carefully into her hand. Noor read it out the way you speak a name that has temporarily lost its family. “Marek, initial M,” she said, and looked up at him with the expression of a person handing over something that might be valuable or might be a trick of light. “It’s not proof,” she added, because she is a good librarian already. “It is a suggestion that belongs next to your bowl. We can look more, but do we want to be the ones who insist an ending because the alphabet wants us to? That feels greedy.”

He took a photograph of the clipping with the respectful distance of a person who has seen what happens when you hold a camera too close to a face. He thought of Lorna’s ring, the faint mark inside that had made a pretence of being a letter and left a smear of certainty on the eye. When he wrote to her he did not say, It is your initial, because he was not willing to let the neatness of that sentence undo years of carefulness. He wrote, We found an index card that liked the look of us. It’s a small thing. It asked to sit near our tea for an afternoon, and she replied hours later with, Good, let it be small, we are not in charge of the size of memory, we are only responsible for the chair we give it.

He met his father again without the theatre of a dramatic reunion to prop it up. They stood together on the deck of a dredger that had been scraped and repainted so many times it carried all its past lives underneath like a secret rainbow. The river at Erith looked like work rather than romance and that suited them both. His father put a mug in his hand that contained a liquid that would call itself tea in public and then regret it in private and said, very simply, “This part,” meaning the machine at their feet, “can kill you quickly if you admire it too loud.” They moved together around the deck as men do who like to be useful in each other’s presence, a choreography of offered spanners and unspoken cautions. Jaro felt the weight of the river under the boat and the patience of the silt as it met the engine’s insistence. He watched his father’s hands do something tender with a stubborn coupling and felt, without needing to narrate it, the comfort of being instructed by a man he could imagine becoming without having to lie to himself.

At lunch they sat on a coil of rope that had earned the right to be temporary furniture and ate cheese and an apple between them like two schoolboys out of time. His father asked about Southend in a way that didn’t turn the conversation into an exam, and Jaro found himself speaking the names of tutors and paragraphs and the exact version of silence that exists in a room when people have decided to be brave. His father told him how the river behaves just before a storm arrives, not in the sky yet but underneath, a change in the weight of water against hull, and Jaro thought about how people do that too, how you can feel an argument arrive in someone’s body before their face has agreed. When they parted that day there were no declarations and no promises dressed up as statements, only the shared sense that two men had done something steady and useful and might wish to do it again.

A letter came from Basildon Council with the sort of dry tone paper uses when it is going to grant you a tiny victory and pretend it was nothing. The adult education centre wanted someone to lead a Saturday workshop about writing places that do not apologise for existing, and someone had said his name in the right room. He stood in the kitchen with the letter and felt the impulse to look behind him to see who they were addressing, then laughed because that impulse had become a habit and habits deserve to be teased. Noor collected the details out of his hands and arranged them into something that looked like a plan. “We will call it Edges,” she said, chewing on a pencil eraser the way she chews on a thought until it stops pretending to be shy. “We will make the room behave and the chairs not wobble and we will give them biscuits that don’t crumble entirely. You will say the words that make people stare at the floor and then look up because they’ve been caught out loving something.”

He told Lorna about it and she sent back a photograph of a gull on a lamp with the caption, Patron saint of tolerated arrogance, and then, after a pause, a paragraph in which she confessed that the Lysander’s owners had asked her to stay on past the promised month, stretching the voyage into the weather that makes sensible people work on land. “It is both exactly what I have worked for and exactly the sort of thing that makes me put my hand flat on a table and breathe,” she wrote. “I can come down for the day of your workshop. We can put the rings on the table in the sun like we planned and then I will go back and keep faith with charts and men called Colin who carry knives as if they are pens.” He read those lines in the garage with his glove still on because he had not had the grace to take it off, and the tyre he was meant to be checking felt in his hand like a problem that would allow itself to be solved later in gratitude for the world behaving in one small place for a minute.

They chose a day that walked the line between summer and weather with dignity and went to Leigh with the rings in their separate pockets. Noor came with envelopes for rubbings and a pencil that had been in her rucksack since she was fifteen, and his mother came because she wanted to do something that looked like going out without it being the sort of outing people have opinions about. They found a table outside the café that pretends its coffee is Paris when it is very plainly the estuary, and they set the rings on a piece of white paper the way other people might set bulldog clips. The brass looked dull until the sun arrived between clouds and taught it to have ambitions. Lorna took a soft pencil and, laughing at herself and the antique theatre of it, held the ring steady with her finger and made the lightest of rubbings on the paper. The marks rose up shyly: the little waves first, as if announcing that we are all rhythm before we are declaration, then the almond shape that could be an eye or the mouth of a prayer, and then, on the inside, a letter that refused to be an obedient one. It could be M. It could be the memory of M. It could be W turned over by a pocket and a life.

Noor made a rubbing of the ring Jaro had found and then of the one from the classroom, and the letters were cousins; you could not make them say anything they did not want to say, but you could not entirely prevent your brain from organising them into the convenient story of a name, either. His mother watched with the humour of a person who has learned to live with the slippages between romance and fact. “You can have your M,” she said, tapping the paper in a way that made her knuckle look briefly like a priest. “You can have it without sentencing anyone to a fate they did not choose. Stories come back not because we force them, but because they have chosen the house. Let them sit where they want.”

They didn’t put the rings in the water. That would have been the sort of gesture that begs a wave to make an example of you. They put them on the table, in the sun, and drank their coffee, and let the brass warm until it was almost uncomfortable to touch. The rings did not sing or roll to meet. They sat there with the stubbornness of useful metal and looked like exactly what they were: a pair of circles that had been carried by more than one story each. The boy with the metal detector came past with his coil and his grin and stopped like a needle finding a groove. He looked at the rings, looked at the four faces, and said, with enormous dignity, “You found them on purpose,” and they all laughed because that was unarguably true. He offered to lend them his spare headphones and they thanked him as if he had given them a tool they would need later in the day.

On the workshop Saturday, the education centre smelled like ghost whiteboard and damp carpet and optimism. The hedge outside looked a little less resigned. People came in with notebooks they had only just forgiven for being bought too recently, and they sat in the way adult learners do, ready to make their bodies do the discipline their heads are shy of. He started with the small, as he had promised himself, by asking them to write down the name of a place they would defend even if it made them look foolish, and then to write down something they had witnessed there that they had never told anyone because it refused to arrange itself into either gossip or glory. He said the word estuary and watched the word make a place in their mouths, and then he asked them not to apologise. Lorna sat at the back like a polite miracle, hair knotted up with the accuracy of someone who could tie something in the dark while the room rolled, and when he said something about water teaching borders humility he heard her make the small sound she made when a sentence had earned a chair.

They wrote for ten minutes that felt like ten minutes and an extra room, and then they read, and the air arranged itself around the sentences the way it does when the truth is happening and nobody wants to embarrass it by staring. A woman read about the smell of low tide, treacle and knives, and a man read about a boy on a bike doing figure eights against a wall that had been repointed by someone who believed in perfect lines, and someone else read about a bus shelter in rain at night that had kept five strangers alive with its illusion of purpose. He managed, for once, not to get in the way of other people’s words with his own. When they finished, he said “Yes,” the way his tutor had said it, and he looked at Lorna as if asking whether that was the right size of permission, and she smiled and tilted her head in the little nod that meant he could stand down.

Afterwards, they stayed to put the chairs back in arrangements the room remembered, and the boss’s girlfriend arrived with lemonade in a jug that had known better days and a plate of biscuits she had bought as if wooing a committee. Lorna helped fold the flipchart paper and made fun of the pretence of it and then slipped the sheet with the ring rubbings into her bag the way someone puts away a postcard from a place they used to recognise. They walked out together into air that had been rinsed by a short, demonstrative shower, and she touched his sleeve with two fingers and said, “You were kind without cowardice. That is the right combination.” He shrugged because modesty is a functioning piece of machinery in him, and she let him and did not make him flatter himself with arguments.

On the train back up to Harwich she sat with the ring in her hand under the table as if feeling for a pulse she had invented. The Lysander’s extension had been confirmed and she had signed the paper without letting anyone see her face become the mixture it naturally wanted to be: triumph’s sober older sister walking it to the party and telling it not to spill. She wrote him a line that said only, I am on my way to the greedy water with biscuits in my bag, and he wrote back, Eat two immediately, save one to bargain with a future version of yourself, and she, smiling in the terrible light of a train toilet, obeyed.

The storm that arrived in October did not have a politician’s name this time; it had no name at all, perhaps annoyed at the summer’s theatrics. It came with intention and left the trees scolding the pavements with leaves. The forecast’s voice was the same—a person who would be calm about the apocalypse if that was on the card—and it set out the terms with the unemotional hospitality of a maître d’. Gale eight becoming severe gale nine later, it said, and Jaro stood at the sink with a damp cloth in his hand and said the words along with it like vows. He did not pretend to be the sort of man who is above superstition; he had the ring in his pocket and touched it the way one touches a railing on a staircase you could manage without, not because you doubt your legs but because one day you will be grateful you didn’t demand that they be perfect.

Work turned into a series of rescues and small prevention. A man brought in a van that had attempted romance with a puddle, and the van had left the relationship feeling used. Jaro put his hands where the water had thought it was allowed to be, and convinced it of different logic, and the man went away looking newly fond of the idea that people who fix things exist in the world. An older woman came in because a light had decided to testify on her dashboard, and he told her it was not an omen but a sensor, and she left reassured as if he had made a promise with the gods. Between jobs he checked his phone and there were messages delayed, and then a photograph of the ring against scratched paint and a caption, Behaviour: good, argument with ladder: lost, and his body made the choice to believe the word good louder than it believed the others. At midnight the wind took the lid off something on the roof and the house made a sound like a trapped person sighing, and he lay awake and tracked ships in his head with names that felt borrowed, and when he slept he dreamed of chalk again, a hand drawing a curve so carefully that the curve understood itself as coastline and not ambition.

The day after the storm he went with his father’s spanner in his pocket to a yard where a smaller boat had sat out the night in a mood. The man who owned it had the shaky relief of a narrow escape and spoke nonsense sentences that had too many pronouns and not enough handholds. Jaro found the thing that had shaken loose and returned it to its sensible argument with the rest of the machine, and the man said thank you as if the word had been hidden under a floorboard for years and they had just found it. His father emerged from behind a stack of something that pretended to be empty and wiped his hands on a rag and made a face that was trying not to be a smile. “You brought a decent spanner,” he said, like a title bestowed. “Decent spanners know how to behave in a storm’s echo.”

Letters multiplied at the house the way letters will when life decides it is ready to speak in that medium again. The library sent him a notice for an event Noor was organising called Boundaries: Archives and Appetite, which made him love her with hysterical accuracy. Southend sent him an assignment back with a handwritten note that used the word muscular about a sentence he had written about rope, which made him unreasonably proud of a noun. A small magazine with a circulation that would fit on a bus wrote to ask whether they could print his piece about brake lights and rivers, and he said yes and did not pretend to be blasé. A postcard came from a harbour whose name made you bite your tongue a little, and all it said in an economy that humbled him was: On nights like this I put the ring and the pen in the same pocket so they can discuss techniques. On balance, the ring is less of a snob.

When she came down again it was on a day lacquered in light, the sort of day the estuary does sometimes to confuse people into forgetting its true habits. They walked the length of the seawall with the leisure of people who had earned it against weather, and they did not talk about what would happen in winter, not yet. She told him about a shoal that had shifted like a cat deciding where to sleep and about how the men on board had made a superstition of who would make the first cup of tea after midnight because the last time it had not been him, something inefficient had occurred. He told her about a young man who had brought a car in because it made a rattle that sounded like regret and who had confessed that he had driven halfway to Norwich before remembering to turn the radio off to hear it properly. They laughed for the same reason and at the same moment, and that felt like the sort of intimacy that doesn’t embarrass you later.

They brought the classroom ring and the found ring into the sun for an hour and then put them away without scene. He did not ask her if she would stay; she did not ask him if he would come. They were not cowards; they were pragmatic about the size of their lives and the weather’s opinion of their schedules. They sat with their shoulders touching, and when a little boy fell spectacularly and sat up in that outraged silence children make before they cry, they both turned, and it was Lorna who reached the mother with the sort of words that put the world back in its joints without telling it off. Later, sitting with her slant smile and the light on her face making her look like an invented saint of sensible conduct, he thought that love might be this: the deep desire that the other person move through the world with as little bruising as possible, and the willingness to be a small piece of furniture in their house when asked.

On the last morning before she went back up the river, he woke before the forecast and sat at the table with the ring beside his hand and wrote. He wrote about the way brass takes on your heat and then insists on giving it back at its own pace. He wrote about the internal weather of a boat, the particular climate of a cabin where someone is trying to sleep and someone else is counting. He wrote about the smallness of grand tokens and the grandeur of small faithful acts, like drying a ring with the edge of a shirt and putting it back where it thrives. He wrote about his father’s laugh and how it felt not so much like forgiveness as like a door being left on the latch. He wrote about Basildon waking up like a machine, because that is how it had begun, and how he had learned that machines have their own poetry if you listen long enough without needing to call the music something else. He finished a paragraph that startled him with its quiet, and he looked up and found he had been writing for two hours, and in that time the forecast had read the names and the town had decided to be the kind version of itself.

When she left that afternoon with a bag that had acquired new scars, she put her hand on his chest where the string sat under his shirt and she did it like someone checking a knot. “I will be back,” she said, not in the careless way of people who don’t know the shape of the sea but in the considered tone of someone who has been hired by it and has learned how to negotiate her own terms. “If I am asked to be longer, I will be longer. I am not a better person when I am on land. I am simply a different one. Keep the ring where it can hear the house.”

“Keep the other ring where it can insult the weather,” he said, and she laughed in that soft, unsorry way that had made him want to follow the chalk line the first day into whatever came next. They did not kiss on the platform because some public gestures beg the world to interfere. They did something almost no one saw: they put their foreheads together for a second, a small secular blessing, and then stepped away from it like adults who can count.

Autumn did its work without being asked to become a metaphor. The trees around the estate found yellows they had been hoarding, and the puddles remembered their jobs. The workshop took on that oily gloom that asks for a radio to be brave, and he obliged and let a man with a friendly voice shout opinions about the league in as if that could keep a bearing in its seat. Noor made the local history room do a monthly night with tea and biscuits and the story of a map, and people came and performed the ancient human act of being pleased to be told anything to do with where their feet were. His mother’s knee behaved provided it was addressed politely and given its banisters. His father sent a second note that contained very little information and a sentence that he will remember if he outlasts the boat, which was: A ring is only a circle if you hold it wrong; hold it right and it becomes a grip. He put that sentence on the wall next to THAMES in letters that were perhaps too neat and did not regret the neatness.

On a night when the wind did not have time to be dramatic but was efficient, he woke to the thought that there were three circles in the house and one at sea and that none of them were waiting for him to decide what they meant. He lay with his hands behind his head and listed the shipping forecast names inwardly until he felt the childlike pleasure of lists, Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger, Fisher, German Bight, Humber, Thames, Dover, and he stopped before Wight, as if to save a little for later. He turned onto his side and could have sworn he felt the small dull acknowledgement of the ring in the bowl when the pipe ticked, and in the morning he told no one because not all miracles deserve the humiliation of being written down.

He ran before first light one day when the town had decided to be a submarine and found himself at the education centre hedge without thinking, and laughed quietly at his own circuits. He stood there for a minute, long enough to understand that he was not there to go backwards, and then turned and ran toward the market, where the awnings woke up like sensible flags. An old man with a newspaper under his arm like a measured threat nodded to him as if he had proved a point no one had been arguing. He got home and the bowl by the door told him what day it was by the weight of keys, which is to say he had learned to like his house mirrored back at him in cheap metal.

In late October the Lysander sent him a photograph of a sunrise that looked expensive and an email containing nothing but a list of five unfamiliar words and then, after the list, an explanatory line: Norwegian names for the kind of wind that tells you it is not interested in making friends. He wrote a paragraph back about the east wind across the car park between the tower blocks that makes even men with heavy coats get religion, and kept the list in his pocket and took it out at lunch and taught it to Ben from tyres like a trick, and they said the words out loud together and felt good at their mouths for knowing them.

The last week of the month, he taught another Saturday and the hedge paid attention, and a woman read about her father’s shed as if it were a chapel with a smell of swarfega, and a man cried and apologised and then stopped apologising because the room had already done it for him. He walked home with a tote bag heavier with paper than perhaps one person should be allowed to carry for their own good, and he stopped on the stairs to press his palm against the wall where the map lived, and he felt, very simply, happy in a way that did not need to be admired to survive.

The forecast came on that night and did not flinch at its own calm. He listened to it the way a believer might listen to a short service after a hard week. When the radio clicked off with that small electricity sigh, the house made the sound houses make when they dare to believe they have done their job for the day, and the ring in the bowl acknowledged the keys and the paperclip and the coin from a bus in a country he has not visited, and the spanner on the shelf sat like a sentence that has agreed not to show off. He went to bed and lay with the book he was not reading on his chest and thought of the boat with its numbers pretending not to be a picture and of the woman on it who had allowed herself to be as rational as she liked without mistaking that for a law of nature, and he thought of Basildon waking up like a machine, which is to say with purpose and a little noise and a good heart, and he thought of circles that were not demands but offers. He fell asleep between names and work and the particular hope of ordinary days and dreams in which chalk makes maps that refuse to leave you behind.Chapter 9

November came in a soft shoe, fog slipping between buildings as if it had been given a key and a hint. Basildon learned the trick of turning into a quiet aquarium at dawn; everything swam without leaving its place. The forecast’s names sounded closer in that weather, as if Dogger and Humber had taken rooms on the next street and were sharing milk. He ran early and found his breath enlarging the air in front of him, a gentle proof that he was, for the moment, warmer than the world. On the way home he touched the bowl by the door like a bell you hum rather than strike and felt for the ring without taking it, the way you might confirm an old friend is still asleep on your sofa and decide not to wake them.

Noor’s event at the library drew in people who had not expected to see themselves in the word archive and were pleased to find it had been trained to sit. She wore authority like a sweater you didn’t notice was new until halfway through the evening and introduced “Appetite” as if it were a valid research method. A woman came with a biscuit tin that once held biscuits and now held photographs of men leaning on small boats like reluctant heroes, and a shy man produced a logbook with columns in a hand as narrow as the channels it recorded. There were minutes from a meeting about the right paint for a buoy, stern and tender at once, and the small miracle of a child’s drawing of a lighthouse that looked like it had learned manners. Jaro stood at the edge and watched Noor make coaxing into an art, and when she brought over an older woman with hair like tidy wire and a gaze sharp enough to strip paint, he straightened in the way people do when consequence approaches.

“He’s the one,” Noor said, half-mocking and wholly true, and the woman set down a folder that had been repaired three times by people who meant it. “Everyone says that about everyone now,” she said briskly, and then softened her voice by half a tone. “I’m Ida. My sister kept a shop for fifty-three years. She sold papers and safety pins and, for a while, a particular kind of ring sailors’ wives insisted on. I remember them because I thought they looked like the sea trying to make a bracelet and getting bored. Waves on the outside, a little eye-shape they said was protection. Inside they’d scratch an initial and pretend it was a covenant. They bought them in pairs sometimes. If you believe everything you read, that meant something. If you believe what I saw, it meant they liked a story they could hold.”

He felt the familiar agitation of recognition, not the fireworks kind, the spanner kind, steady and capable. Ida turned a page, and there, pasted with glue that had survived three governments, was a clipping about a jeweller in Leigh offering “Charm Rings — Seawise and Stubborn” for sixpence a piece in 1929. There was a sketch of the pattern done by someone with patience and a ruler, and though the lines were innocent of salt and damage, his hands knew the curve. “Thorne & Keeling,” Ida said, tapping the name with a finger that had been owning its work for decades. “They made their patterns in bulk and called them talismans because they weren’t religious and didn’t want the vicar to get interested. People like circles because they have the decency not to end just where you expect them to. Are yours Thorne & Keeling?” she asked with that efficient nosiness that makes a town a town. “I don’t mean yours personally,” she added, and of course she did.

“Maybe,” he said, because the truth had not agreed to be quick. “They want to be. They don’t mind if they aren’t.” Ida nodded once as if he had answered an exam he didn’t know he was taking, and Noor looked pleased as if she had arranged for meanings to queue properly and take their turn.

A postcard arrived from the Lysander with a smear of rust along the edge as if the boat itself had licked it before it left. On the front was a picture of a coastline so low it seemed to be keeping its head down, and on the back Lorna had written without apology in pencil. Fog that smells like teeth. A shoal that changed its address between breakfast and lunch. We traced an old wreck that performs a new trick at certain tides; the bottom here is a language that keeps revising itself. Your ring behaves like a sensible annoyance. I held it against the rail during a short sulk and it made the sound it makes, which might simply be metal in weather. She had drawn a small circle after her name that made him smile like a person who has been quietly let in through a side door.

His father sent, surprisingly and without ceremony, a text that contained no performance: Spare seat tomorrow if you want it. Out of Erith. Mud business. Boots. Don’t bring romance, bring a sandwich. It was exactly the sort of message the river would write if it took a phone. He told the garage with the minimum number of words and put his old jacket on because the new one had not yet learned his shoulders. He took the classroom ring in his pocket like a coin with which to pay for a lesson and sat on the top deck of a bus out of habit, so he could watch the roads draw themselves underneath.

On the dredger, the deck had the texture of history and boots. The machine did not dignify itself with metaphor; it was a practical insistence, steel applied to the muddy stubbornness of geography. His father moved around it with that half-arguing grace men develop when they have wrestled the same creature for years and knocked the pride out of it without trying to kill it entirely. “Don’t stand there,” his father said, not unkindly, pointing with his chin at a space that looked like a space and was the opposite. “Stand here, where the habit of not dying lives.” They drank tea that had been brewed in disagreement with water, and the river rose under them as if to make a point about levels and patience. He watched slurry take on the exact shade of apology and then drain into the belly of the boat with a sound like an old promise being honoured.

They spoke in the grammar of work first because for some conversations the soul needs an engine. His father showed him a coupling that misbehaved in the rain and a lever that talked back and the way a certain sound meant not yet, not yet, now. Jaro found the rhythm between questions and silence, and the ring in his pocket warmed at the same pace as the skin of his thigh. At mid-morning, crouched against a coil of rope, his father cleared his throat, not theatrically but because his age and the weather had a handshake, and said, “I read what you wrote about brake lights,” as if he were admitting to listening at a door and finding his own name. “It made me think of the first time I drove to Canvey before I knew how the roads speak. I braked like a man who didn’t believe in consequence and the island didn’t throw me into the river because it was being kind. You know how to hear machineries that are not exactly machines. That’s good. You can give a thing its dignity without dressing it up.”

After, back on the low road that carries lorries like prayers, Jaro held both rings in his mind and understood with a small intimacy he had not managed before that his father was the sort of man who refused to be anything but a person in motion, and that you cannot keep such people, only offer them places to sit that are not traps. He did not think that with sadness. He thought it with relief, as if someone had drawn him a map that did not pretend to be kind by lying.

Winter presented its first proper intention with a frost so clean you could hear it in thin glass. The garage turned into a place where breath meant business and men negotiated with fingerless gloves and reason. He bought his mother a new hot water bottle because the old one had developed airs, and a lamp for his desk that performed the miracle of making late feel like deliberate. The cheque from the bus-fitting magazine arrived tucked in a letter that tried hard not to be proud of itself and he took Noor for cake with the sort of extravagance you are allowed when your money has been translated from words. They ate slices that understood their job and she told him he would need bank accounts for publications and he accused her, affectionately, of trying to make him behave like a man with receipts. She put the new lanyard around his neck and he wore it for three minutes and then set it on the table like a pet visiting.

News came down like careful weather about the wreck at Maplin Sands, where low tide excavated ribs and the sea pretended to be a forgiving archaeologist. Lorna wrote about it with a delight she permitted herself the way other people permit themselves dancing on good nights. We found the bones of something that thought it would not be looked at again, she wrote. The men are being polite to their own superstition, and I am letting them think it is theirs. There is a story about a pair of rings thrown here and not kept by the water because the water likes jokes. It is probably rubbish. I like the taste of it. Your town invents good folklore; that is not nothing.

At Noor’s next archive night, a man with a voice that had been turned down by cigarettes gave a halting speech about rings with eyes. He had the name Ned in his pocket and was prepared to lend it to them for an hour. “You get pairs,” he said, thumbing the air into shape. “Brother and sister, sometimes. Twins, sometimes. Sometimes just two people who didn’t fancy the idea of the sea being the only thing that got to keep anything. My nan used to say, if you have a pair of rings and you lose one, the other will go about its business trying to find it, showing up at boot fairs and in trouser pockets and in the mouths of angler’s catches just to embarrass the distance. Load of old romance,” he added, deferential to reality, “and yet—” He left the rest where it belonged and the room did the thing rooms do when a sentiment that refuses a name sits down and crosses its legs with confidence.

The small blonde boy with the metal detector brought Jaro, with thrilling ceremony, a coin he had no use for and a rubber washer he declared a decoy. They stood on the seawall where the river does its regular rehearsal of pretending to be tame and compared their treasure. The boy had learned the names of sands as if they were cousins and lectured Jaro kindly about Chapman and Foulness and the bits between that have opinions. “You look different,” the boy said abruptly, in that way children do when their honesty chooses them without asking. “Like when someone finds out where they put the thing that makes them walk straight.” Jaro laughed and resisted the urge to hand the child a scholarship. “I bought a lamp,” he said. “It works like a promise.”

His mother’s knee staged a less theatrical and more effective demand, ask me kindly or I will misbehave in public, and he and his father did the practical ballet of assistance without needing instruction. There was a moment in the kitchen afterward that wanted to be written down and would be hurt if it were. His father stood with his hands on the back of a chair he was not yet sitting in and looked at the bowl by the door where the ring from the classroom had taken on the concentrated plainness of a resident. The man’s face went through at least three versions of itself and settled on the one that had been chosen for respect. “You’ve made a house,” he said, not compliment and not criticism, and his mother, stirring soup with that attention she taught to her children the way some people teach hymns, said without turning, “We have.” It did not feel like a victory. It felt like scaffolding that had decided it would allow itself to be called a wall.

At Southend, the tutor with the deliberate commas brought them a poem about fog that had the nerve to be specific and then asked for something small and honest in return. Jaro wrote about condensation stuttering on the inside of a workshop window and a customer wiping a circle with his sleeve, and about that small circle containing, briefly, the face of someone making the world behave. When he read it aloud, the room nodded as if it had seen the same trick and been grateful to be reminded. Later, on the bus, he wrote the first paragraph of an essay called Good Borrow because Lorna’s phrase would not stop offering him a title. He wrote about being lent a father and lent a teacher and lent a river and lent an hour in which to be precise, and how debts like those are not collected if you keep up.

The fog found its theatre at Maplin and the Lysander moved on instruments and intention. Lorna sent a sentence that contained more care than it admitted: We will not pretend we can see and we will act as if we can, which is the basis of many human undertakings. The ring clicked once and then minded itself. After a day spent listening for soundings with the patience of a cat before a mouse reconsiders, she sat in the galley and wrote him a line that made him put his head down on the table and grin like an idiot. A man here swears the sea is a memory that wants to live in our throats, she wrote. I told him that idea belonged to a boy who changes tyres like he’s voting, and he laughed and gave me the best seat when the sun came out for a grudging minute.

On a Tuesday that felt like a shrugged apology from the calendar, the adult education centre let him use a room again for the second installment of Edges. People came in with their coats performing weather reports and found chairs that remembered them. A man in a suit he did not want to own read about the precise hum of the freezers in the corner shop at two in the morning when he needed to be among lights, and an older woman told a story about the pharmacy queue as chorus. Someone new wrote about the ashtray on her balcony collecting umbrellas of rain over a week and the way pigeons looked like they were discussing her choices, and when the room laughed it spared her. He left the session with the particular satisfaction that feels like a good socket fit, the not-flashy snug of an idea in its proper place. Lorna wasn’t there, but he carried her sentences in the way a pocket carries warmth.

He stopped by the jeweller’s that had inherited Thorne & Keeling’s location and perhaps none of its scruples. The current incumbent had hands that looked better around coffee than tools, but he knew where the old catalogues were, and there was, in a drawer thin as a big book, a plate marked STUDY: WAVED, EYE, 3/16. Jaro traced the outline with a finger above the paper and thought of Ida and of patterns that survive commerce. “People still ask,” the jeweller said, a little embarrassed by the romance of it all. “They want symbols to behave, even now. I tell them the old brass turns your finger green. They say good, they want evidence.”

On a Saturday when frost made the grass take itself seriously, he made breakfast like someone who has been told he can, eggs that didn’t insist on showing off and tea that achieved itself. His mother read aloud a line from the local paper about a planning meeting in which a man had said the word mitigation eight times and used it to mean apology and money. They laughed in the tidy way people do when laughing harder would require time. He took the ring from the bowl and rolled it in his palm while the kettle decided its sentence and thought, not for the first time, that some obligations are light only because you have learned, with practice, how to carry them.

A school friend he barely kept the string of wrote to say his wife had read the brake light piece and wanted to send a class of teenagers to the garage to “see work,” which made him smile without cruelty at the idea of children being marched into the poetry of torque. He agreed and later showed five baffled sixteen-year-olds the dignity of thread and the satisfaction of a bolt learned to behave and they, in return, showed him they knew every song that had been recorded since a year he had stopped paying attention. He tried to explain the shipping forecast as a kind of chorus without faces, and a girl with eyebrows that meant business said, “That’s like when the bus announces the stops and you love it for pretending to be God.” He wrote that down afterwards so as not to forget that wisdom does not always dress like it is supposed to.

His father came by on a day when the sky had the colour of a dull knife and stood with his hands in his pockets as if he were trying to teach them manners. They did not do anything significant. They lifted a thing together that required two people because that is easier for facts than for feelings. They went to the corner for chips and ate them out of paper that insisted on transferring newsprint to grease, and his father said a sentence that worked like a spare part fitting. “I liked the bit in your piece about how listening is a tool. I was a fool not to use it. You don’t have to be a fool to forgive a fool.” Jaro put a chip in his mouth because chewing is a legitimate way to allow language to land, and he nodded. They walked back under a sky that had decided to make do and the world did not applaud and that was correct.

He and Noor began a ritual of sitting in the local history room after closing, half because Noor needed to look at lists for a reason she had forgotten and half because being among boxes makes a certain kind of thinking easier. They found a notice about a man called Marek, M, who had been fined for improper lamp usage in 1932, a petty little fact that felt like an affectionate flick to the forehead. “We could make your entire life into one of those family research programmes if we become monsters,” Noor said, making a terrifying face. “We could order certificates and interpret birthmarks as omens and write down every instance of the letter M and then decide we had proved a point. Or we could keep letting the small things sit in our bowl, and bring them out for company when needed. I am in favour of bowls.”

He wrote more in November than he had ever written while also being a person among oil and buses. He wrote sentences that needed to be walked away from and then returned to like cooling pastry, and he wrote one that arrived fully dressed and only asked to be given a seat. He wrote about fog not as mystery but as a kind of attention that the world gives itself when it’s tired of everyone looking at only their own hands. He wrote about how boys on bikes learn the edge of the curb the way gulls learn wind and how a ring on a chain makes noise at your throat when you run downstairs as if to remind you that movement is a good trick. He wrote in Czech now and then without translating, not as a challenge but as a place to think a sentence where it fit first.

One evening of fog so thick it made alleys inside itself, he walked with the classroom ring in his pocket to the cockle sheds and watched men wash their hands in a sink that had earned the right to be foul. The sound of water was complicated there, as if several centuries were trying to report at once. A man with a dog that had learned to be both suspicious and friendly nodded and said, apropos of nothing, “You hear it when you’re ready,” and Jaro felt ridiculous and correct for wanting to answer the dog instead of the man. He went into the pub and the chairs looked relieved to see people who were not ambitions. He drank a pint that wasn’t a pint and wrote three sentences in the margins of a flier for bingo, because good paper is a luxury but bad paper is a service.

A small magazine printed his piece called Good Borrow in a column without fuss, and he saw it by accident on the counter of the library and laughed too loud to be dignified. Noor held her breath until he stopped and then whacked him with the magazine like a person exorcising a minor demon. “You are doing it,” she said, meaning several things. “Please continue.”

The Lysander sent a message that felt like rope in the hand. Fog heavy. Instruments polite. Minor stupidity from a winch corrected by a man called Colin with an unearned knife. Ring worked as a timekeeper in a way I will explain with chips. We passed the place with the bones again and I thought of rubbings in the sun and how much I prefer my metaphors to be manual. Sleep well in a town you will allow to be ordinary. He replied with a list of things the ordinary had done to prove its worth that day: a bus stopping for a mother who ran and the driver pretending it was an accident; a boy catching his friend’s hoodie when the friend failed a step and both of them making a joke to save their tears; his mother answering the door without the wince the knee had been charging this month. He added, The ring in the bowl made a noise when I put my keys down today. It was either physics or greeting. I am content to be a man who accepts both.

On the last day of the month, frost lined the low wall outside the education centre like a neat thought you don’t want to ruin by poking. He ran his fingers along it and watched the damp print fatten and fade. The hedge had begun to find its winter courage and stood up a little, and he saluted it because he had decided not to be ridiculous about who he talked to. He went inside and set up the room like a person respectful of chairs and the uses of a circle. When the first student came in, a man who had decided to be honest in a jumper that was trying to apologise for something it couldn’t help, Jaro smiled in the way he’d learned from women with chalk and men with rope. He felt all his rings without touching any of them and the house inside him that had once been a garage understood the day’s labour. Far away, the forecast would speak its names. Near at hand, the kettle would argue itself into usefulness and someone would say a sentence they had been thinking for twenty years and believe it only when they heard it aloud. He put his hand briefly to his chest where the string lay like a hibernating idea and he thought, as calmly as an engine at idle, Keep up.
