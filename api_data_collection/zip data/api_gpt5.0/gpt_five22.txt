The cranes over the harbor look like birds that forgot how to land. From the roof of the warehouse where we rig the silks, I can see their metal necks dipping and rising, dipping and rising, as if they are rehearsing for a show where they have to pretend to be gentle. The air smells of tar and oranges and that faint, human salt that comes when a whole city breathes at once. Somewhere a ship horn booms and the vibration shivers the glass in our windows.

“Try again,” Oakes calls, not unkindly but with that spilled-coffee impatience he brings to anything that lasts longer than a day. “I want the drop to feel like falling, not like you remembered your rent is due.”

I climb. The fabric is the same red as a stop sign, the kind of red you don’t mistake. It streaks down to my ankles as I knot and wrap, heel lagging, knee pressing, the old choreography in my hands before my mind can catch up. The ceiling is high, patched in places where thirstier leaks have made themselves conspicuous. I flip, count time. My body knows it. It remembers every bruise I ever earned like it was a lesson with a test coming up.

On the mat, Alyx watches me, her hair pulled tight into a small knot that always escapes in these brave little wisps by her ears. “Commit,” she says, like she’s telling me a secret. “Commit like you mean it.”

“I always do,” I say.

Lies. You can lie with your mouth or with your shoulders, and mine are already anticipating the burn. I let go. For a breath I’m falling, actually falling, and then the fabric finds me and there’s that slap against my thigh, the rush of it, the world a column that spins once and then decides I can live. Applause. Not much. The clumsy polite sound of six acrobats and a director who claps with his fingers, not the meat of his hands.

“Better,” Oakes says. “Again.”

I do it again. I do it until small points of the world go white when I look at them. This is the kind of wanting that has to be trained. Wanting to be seen. Wanting to be held up. Wanting to be the one who defies the physics the world is so proud of.

We break. Pigeon and Dev start arguing about the rigging, how tight is too tight, whether friction is a mood. Ellie tapes her ankle in the corner and hums like someone who has to keep herself together with a tune. The radio will not stop playing the same throwback station, tinny through the old speakers, summery songs that insist nothing irretrievable exists.

Alyx tosses me a bottle of water. My hands are raw enough that the cold almost feels hot.

“You didn’t sleep,” she says, like she went through my garbage and found the proof.

“I slept.” I stretch until my hips whisper. “Just the kind where you watch your dreams like a movie from the last row.”

“You could sleep in my bed,” she says. “In our bed.” A joke, and not. We share a place because rents are like ocean swells. You think you can keep your feet and then something unseasonable comes along to remind you that the house always wins.

“I went to the recruiting office,” I tell her.

I didn’t plan to. I planned to make small talk about the gull that has learned to steal churros from the kids on Shoreline. But my mouth refuses to wait for a better moment. It makes perfect, ridiculous sense once the words are out. They hang there between us like a trick I haven’t practiced.

“For a show?” she asks, eyebrows up. “The one with the slackline soldiers? Please tell me the flyer was ironic.”

“For the army,” I say. “They call it military now because the word has better shoes. I want to sign up.”

“No,” she says, immediately. No gentle. No humor. Her water bottle lifts and falls as if someone else is holding it. “Mira. No.”

Oakes looks over. Pigeon, who is always ready to be part of a scene, shushes the song on the radio and leaves the volume low enough for my pulse to be louder.

“Not on my floor,” Oakes calls. “Not politics. Not war. Not—I don’t have the patience for one more moral argument about the world when all I’m trying to do is make a thing that will let some people forget their bad backs for an hour.”

“It’s my world,” I say, softer, to Alyx. “It’s my back.”

She takes a step toward me, then stops like the floor in front of her is suddenly suspect. “You don’t do this. You don’t jump because something looks like the opposite of here.”

“It’s not the opposite,” I say. “It’s another version.”

“The version with guns,” she says. “The version where you can’t decide what kind of leap you signed up for.”

I laughed when I left the recruiter’s office. I laughed for a full block. The man behind the glass had the kind of crew cut you could set a glass of water on. He told me this was a way out, a way in, a way through, and every third sentence he adjusted the frame of his university certificate like it would slide off the wall if he forgot to touch it. He had a tattoo he thought his cuffs hid and a habit of subtracting every question I asked from my IQ. You are a special candidate, he said. You have control of your body. He told me I could go far. He told me the same story he tells a dozen kids a week.

Long Beach is a place with a name that sounds like it’s trying to tell you the truth. We are, I keep thinking, a long beach. We are sand that keeps being sand despite the small catastrophe of footprints. The Queen Mary sits like a costume that retired but still demands to be invited. The road by the marina always seems wet, even when there hasn’t been rain in months. My mother says this is because everything here is being polished by the stubborn salt of ambition.

“You didn’t even tell me you were thinking about it,” Alyx says, that small, contained anger she wears like mascara when she doesn’t have time for the full face.

“Because if I told you, you would tell me no,” I say. “And then it wouldn’t be me deciding.”

“I’m telling you no now.”

“I already took the aptitude test.”

She makes a sound like something made of metal giving way. “You already—what? When? How?”

“Last week. I went in after training. You were buying groceries.”

“Fifteen minutes,” she says faintly, and laughs without liking it. “I was gone for fifteen minutes and you decided to rewrite your whole life in Sharpie.”

“What do I have here?” I ask, and this is the worst version of me, the one who points at a party and calls it a hallway. “We make art out of danger and call it entertainment. We get paid when people are happy to forget the laws of gravity. I love it. But love can be quiet and still want more. I want to see if my body is good for anything besides applause.”

Alyx closes her eyes, and I think for a second she might go to that place in her head where she draws lines. She used to cut things when she was little—paper snowflakes elaborate as a city map, strings that did not need cutting just to see what they became when split. She has a good hand. A precise hand. Once, when we were thirteen, she knelt by a fish washed up on the sand and freed it from the plastic that had pretended to be a jellyfish. She cut quick and clean, and then carried the fish back to a deeper place and waited until it moved. This is what I see when I think of the word sharp.

“Go home,” Oakes says to both of us. “Come back when you either forgive or forget.”

We go. The late light makes everything a scene we might have already done. On Pine, a street preacher smells like mint and tells the crowd that they will be forgiven for the tiny and the enormous sins, but not for the ones they haven’t named yet. A toddler throws a hat at the fountain, and the hat floats like the kid was right about physics. Long Beach is a list I carry without writing: the bakery that sells danishes the size of saucers, the bus stop where a man with a tattoo of a lighthouse on his neck reads plays out loud to the gulls, the wig shop where the owner changes the window display every week and says it keeps the neighborhood in conversation with itself.

Our apartment is a loft, which is a grand way of saying there is one big room and an upstairs shelf where we put our mattresses. The pipes are visible like we are inside the veins of a bigger thing. The windows face south, so afternoons are a performance in light. I love this place so much it hurts even the day we have no milk and the sink backs up and the roaches throw a private festival under the fridge.

We don’t speak for a while. Speech is a muscle you can stretch too thin. There is the sound of the neighbor’s dog chasing its tail in the hallway and the sound of a skateboard catching air and the small, unrepeatable sounds apartments make when they forget you’re in them.

“I have to call my mother,” I say.

“She’ll love this,” Alyx says.

“She’ll hate it,” I say, and we are both correct in the way a coin can be heads and tails depending on how you squint. My mother loves me the way a hurricane loves a coastline. She kisses, she demands, she leaves, she returns with the force of a decision.

I call. She answers on the fourth ring, breathless like she’s been laughing. “Mira, I was just telling Lito you would call. I have a gift for you. Two plantains, the good ones, greasy like sin.”

“I’m joining the army,” I tell her.

It goes quiet. I can hear the television on in the background, a novella where everyone only ever argues while wearing gold jewelry.

“Are you pregnant?” she asks, because there is a hierarchy to news in my house.

“No.”

“Are you in trouble?”

“No.”

“Then why are you calling me with a stick in the beehive?”

“I want something else,” I say. “I want to know if…”

She breathes in. You can tell a lot about how someone will take a blow by the breath before it lands. “You can be brave in many ways,” she says. “You can be a buffalo and you can be a bird. You don’t have to be a bullet.”

“That’s pretty,” I say.

“It’s a proverb,” she says. “Which is just poetry without math. Mira, you are good. You are good at this thing you made for yourself with your own hands. Why go be good at the thing that makes families put black ribbons on their doors?”

“I’m not cheating on acrobatics,” I say. “I just… I want to see who else I could be if I had to be.”

“You want to crawl under fences and come back with a ring of keys,” she says, and now she’s mad. “You want to be a superhero. You want to be a story people shake their heads at. You want to prove something to a father who keeps his pride like a suit. You—”

“I want to help,” I say, and it is both true and a slogan. Helping is a shape-shifter; it will sit in your hand and mimic whatever else you own.

“Call me after you come back from this office where they talk to you like you are the last glass of water in a season of thirst,” she says. “Call me when you are done wanting to be their yes. We will eat plantains.”

She hangs up. She has always known the exact minute a conversation becomes a fight, and how to stand in the doorway of that minute and wait; sometimes, if I go to her, it is our failure. Sometimes, if she comes to me, it is hers. Not tonight. Tonight, we let the door stay where it is.

“I’m still going,” I tell Alyx.

She is sitting on the low step that pretends to be a stair. She looks at her hands. She has the callouses of a violinist who gave up on elegance and chose blunt force. “I know,” she says. “That’s why I’m mad.”

The recruiter gives me a packet the next morning. The office is between a donut shop that sells cronuts with names like apocalyptic strawberry and a tattoo parlor that has a couch where people become permanent. The recruiting posters have those faces that look straight at you as if they have decided who you are. The man who adjusted his diploma yesterday now adjusts his tie, as though something in him can only be calm if something else is being moved.

“We don’t promise,” he says, which is a kind of promise. “We offer. There are tracks that make sense for people with your background. Fitness, flight school if your tests come back a certain way. Special work. Gymnastics translates. You have discipline.”

“It translates?” I ask. “Is there an exchange rate?”

He smiles at the exact corner of his mouth he learned in a workshop. “You’d be surprised.”

I watch people come in and out while he makes phone calls to make it look like he’s essential. Two men leave with matching baseball caps and chest puffs they did not yet earn. A girl with a pink backpack comes with her grandmother and then leaves with her grandmother, the backpack heavier with pamphlets. The man behind the desk names a number. He says, This many people join every day. He says, This many go on to do extraordinary things. He says, Here’s what the commercials won’t tell you, which is that you will miss your mother when you are hungry.

I sign. My name looks like a signature until the last letter gives up and tries to be anything else. He has me take more tests. He warns me about the haircut and the shoes and the way my breath will smell after three days of saying yes to strangers.

When I leave, I walk the long way home. Past the aquarium where kids press their faces to glass until they remember how to breathe. Past the sculpture that looks like donkeys but is actually horses but is actually a reminder to not be too literal. I eat a bowl of noodles alone by the window of a place where the music is a particular soft-loud-soft that makes thinking either hard or easy depending on what you are trying to think. The bowl is large enough to be a decision. When I pay, the woman at the counter says, Blessings, as if she sees something on me that needs it.

When I get back, Alyx is drawing. She has spread butcher paper over the floor until it looks like our apartment has a pale new skin. She draws with charcoal, greasy lines that could be streets or bones. She hums under her breath. When I say her name, she doesn’t look up right away, which is sometimes how she forgives me.

“I saved you noodles,” she says. “Your favorites. The boiled egg is still doing that thing boiled eggs do when they think they’re being watched.”

“Thank you,” I say.

“You went,” she says.

“I did.”

“How did it feel?”

“Like I have to get my shots updated. Like I am a dog who is allowed in the house if I don’t shed.”

She smiles without taking it personally. “Do you think they looked at your hands and thought, Ah, here is a girl who will catch what we throw at her?”

“Yes,” I say, and we both laugh the small laugh that is almost a cough.

We eat. The sun decides it has given us enough. The sky turns into that bruise color that the weather channel insists on calling something like "mauve twilight." The port lights blink in the distance like a code we weren’t given. We watch the pigeons on the industrial rooftop across the way gather into clumps, then separate, then gather, the way we do.

“Do you remember the story your Tita told,” Alyx says, “about the woman who knew the earthquake was coming because the cats in the village refused to sleep indoors?”

“She had a name for the cats,” I say. “She called them 'the small tigers who forgot what size they are.'”

“They knew,” Alyx says. “She listened, she went outside, she was fine. The house fell and she was fine. The others cursed the cats because the cats did not speak in human words.”

“You’re telling me I’m a cat,” I say. “Or the woman who listened.”

“Both,” she says, and there is a tenderness in it that makes my throat sting.

We go to the beach. That is the thing about living here; the shore is the always-option. No matter the time, there is a place to be small beside something that never apologizes. At night, the sand is a little meaner. It keeps its heat and pretends not to know you. The breakwater sits out there like a lie told to calm a child. The lights on the oil islands are theatrical, like someone staged the idea of the future and forgot to strike the set.

Alyx picks up a lucent chunk of sea glass and holds it to the moon. “We should go to Vegas instead,” she says. “You want to throw yourself at a system until it gives you a prize? We can do it with glitter and air-conditioning.”

“I want to go where nobody knows me,” I say. “No, wait. That’s not true. I want to go where everybody is pretending not to know themselves, and then be there when they do.”

“You have a taste for absolutes,” she says. “You always did.”

We walk and the hem of my jeans takes on the wet with that line it will wear for hours. The gulls make that quick-bored noise. A couple argues by the lifeguard stand in perfect Spanish, beautiful and vicious. I say nothing because language is sometimes a room you only enter if invited.

I come home sore in that tender place under my ribs where anxiety thinks it can live without paying rent. I set alarms for the next steps: medical exam, swearing in, the moment someone cuts my hair without caring if I look like myself.

In the morning, Oakes pretends to forget the conversation. “We’re doing doubles,” he says, as if the air has been cleaned. “We have a festival in three weeks and I do not intend to be the act people use to line up for their porta-potty breaks.”

He puts me with Alyx. He put me with her when we first started too, when we were bad and brave and all adrenaline. He likes our lazy timing, our obsession with breath. We climb. We trust. She is the one at the bottom, her hands a shelf. She is the one at the top, forever thinking with her toes. The fabric is cool at first and then it warms like it’s an animal that likes me. We run the sequence until it is our bones doing it.

“Again,” Oakes says, tickled by his own cruelty.

“Again,” Alyx says, not looking at me, so she won’t ask for anything I am not ready to give.

In the afternoon, Pigeon and Dev come up to me like emissaries. Pigeon wears a shirt that says, Out of Order, and we are supposed to think it’s about the world and not about him. Dev has that way of leaning that suggests he is telling the wall secrets.

“So,” Pigeon says. “The army.”

“It’s not the army,” Dev says. “It’s the military. She said that.”

“Thank you both for your service,” I say, and Dev cracks up and then stops like he isn't supposed to.

“We got you a going-away present,” Pigeon says. “It’s a helmet. It’s a shower cap we painted polka dots.”

“You painted my shower cap?” I ask.

“We acquired a shower cap and painted it,” he says primly. “Also Ellie baked a cake that looks like grenades because she misunderstood the assignment.”

“Don’t go,” Dev says, almost sweet. “You are a reason I like being here in the morning.”

The cake is green and ridiculous, but when we slice it the inside is almond and good, and for a minute we all pretend I am moving to a city in a different time zone to be someone’s assistant and that we can visit when plane tickets are cheap.

When Alyx and I get home, I take the envelope of papers from my bag and put it on the table like an altar. I start to read. It’s all in capital letters and the kind of legal language that loves to enlist small words in big wars. It tells me what my rights are and how they will be interpreted by people who like to talk slowly so I don’t miss the point. It tells me what I will be paid if my fingers become sketches. It tells me where my body ends and a uniform begins.

“You’re making a face,” Alyx says.

“I’m thinking about my ribs,” I say.

“What about them?”

“How hard is a bullet,” I ask, and she covers her ears like someone who has decided the moral experiment is over.

At night I dream I am walking through the warehouse and the cranes are closer, their metal legs crossed delicately like shy dancers. Seagulls fly backward. Oakes is replaced by a man whose face is a blank mask except when he speaks, and then the mask ripples with words that leave his mouth on small strings. This happens sometimes. You do a dangerous thing enough and your mind agrees to be a theater.

I tell myself there will be a notebook in my pocket, in the space where other people put cigarettes. I will make lists. I will write everything down so later I can reconstruct the magic trick. The mind loves to make stories about why you did what you did. If you do it on purpose, you have a better chance of not lying. That is a theory. In practice, I collect phrases and half-dreams like they are shells.

On the day I swear in, Alyx comes with me. She wears a jacket too warm for the weather because she says she wants pockets to put her fists in. My mother does not come. She sends me a picture of plantains and a caption in all caps that reads: I WILL SAVE THESE UNTIL YOU DO SOMETHING ELSE, and four flamingo emojis, and I don’t ask.

We sit in plastic chairs that weld themselves to the idea of waiting. There is a flag on the wall and it is stern and unreal. The man at the front says the words in a voice like he is telling someone in a cave a story about sunlight. I say them after him. I put my hand up and my mouth moves and it feels like a performance I rehearsed in the mirror until I believed I might not mess up. The others swear too. A woman with freckles so dense they become a geography. A boy whose hair looks like he wanted to make a statement but forgot which one. An older man who holds his mouth tight like it might spill. These are my people now, briefly. People who are good at standing still on command.

Outside, Alyx presses her forehead against mine. “Now what,” she asks, and I tell her about the bus, the one that will take me to a place with a name that sounds like someone mispronounced mercy. I tell her about boots and beds and the way morning will start without asking me how I slept.

There is a moment, walking down the steps, where I think I see my father across the street. He’s wearing the shirt he wears when he wants to look like he has made plans. He is holding a paper bag that could be bread. He looks at me and then he looks at the streetlight just beyond me like it is saying something I cannot hear. I put a foot down and then the next and when I look back he is a truck. He is brake lights. He is the small heat those lights cast on my skin.

The bus station smells like popcorn and pine cleaner and the unlovely truth of tired people. I have a small duffel and a list of things I am allowed to have, which is a list written by someone who believes they know what comfort is. Alyx sits with me and we make a plan to talk at stupid hours, at the times when my new schedule thinks it is the only schedule. We plan to send pictures with no captions. We plan to keep our promises in the middle of other people’s rules.

“Do you think you’ll be good at it,” she asks.

“What part,” I ask. “The listening or the doing?”

“The part where they try to make you into a shape that fits their space.”

“Yes,” I say, because I have made myself into shapes before. “No,” I say, because no shape will welcome me long.

She laughs. I love that she laughs. Her laugh isn’t always pretty. It’s the sound you hear when a thing you didn’t know was stuck finally moves. “If you don’t write,” she says, “I’ll come get you.”

“How,” I ask.

“I’ll invent a way,” she says. “I’ll cut out all the rules between us and pretend that’s what scissors were made for.”

When the bus comes, it sighs like a person who has to work the overnight shift. People shuffle and arrange their faces into faces that won’t start fights. I hug Alyx. Her jacket smells like detergent, the unspecific kind that claims to be the smell of a mountain. I hold on and she holds on and then she pushes me away by my shoulders like she has to see if I will stay standing.

“Go,” she says. “Before I remember all the reasons this is a bad idea.”

“I remember them,” I say. “I need to know them by heart so I can argue with myself.”

She kisses me. It’s quick, it’s public, it’s a thing that will make me tip my head and weep later if I let it live there too long. She puts a small thing in my hand, a metal shape. It’s a charm from a bracelet I thought she lost, a little knife engraved with a letter that is not either of our names. She found it. She didn’t tell me. She keeps it for later and then decides it’s later.

“For luck,” she says. “For cutting what needs cutting.”

I go. The bus makes that noisy, heroic lurch; it thinks it’s a protagonist in a story where mechanics are noble. The city slides sideways and then the freeway opens like a mouth that knows my car’s name. Long Beach becomes exit numbers and then becomes a word on a sign you blink and miss. The sky is ordinary and endless and I have that clean panic of new beginnings. I watch the exit signs. I watch the faces of strangers. I watch my hands. They lie still in my lap like good dogs.

At some point I sleep. I wake to a woman laughing at a joke I missed. The man across the aisle is reading a manual for something that looks military-adjacent; he glances at me and then back down, and we agree to pretend we do not recognize a certain seriousness in each other. The driver hums some song from a decade that keeps being sold back to us. The road goes on.

In the new place, which I will come to know by sound before signs, everything is clean in a way that makes you want to dirty it just to reassure yourself that dirt exists and so do you. They take our phones. They take our hair into consideration. They tell us where we will sleep, which is how you learn fast who in a room snores like an apology and who like a warning. They introduce themselves in the precise tone of people who know their names matter more than they will let on. I meet a woman named Rizzo who can laugh with her eyes; a man named Franklin who looks like he was poured into his uniform by a god who liked corners; a kid whose real name is Daniel but who everyone calls Texas before he opens his mouth. I say my name and the woman who writes it down says it back to me slightly wrong and I make a small shrug that means, Sure.

Night again. Lights out like someone slammed the lid on the world. My body wants to climb something. The mattress makes an unpromising noise when I turn. There is a chorus of new-sleep. I count backwards from a number I do not believe I can reach and then I am awake again because the smallest shift of a blanket from the bunk above sounds, to my new ears, like weather.

It is possible, I tell myself, that none of this is happening. It is possible that I am still on the silk under the cranes, rehearsing a fall that I have not yet practiced. It is possible that what I think are orders are just Oakes reminding us where the spotlights will be and how they will insist we be the brightest versions of ourselves in ways that will not feel like kindness. It is possible that I am in my bed at home with the pipes making that steady, idiot heartbeat and Alyx drawing the lines that will become whatever comes next.

“Wake up,” a voice says, and we are awake.

We run. We line up. We say yes. We discover where we blister and where we do not. We are introduced to the idea that we do not belong to ourselves in the morning and maybe not in the afternoon either. My body does what it does when it is told what to do. It listens. It complains. It reminds me that pain is a habit you can choose to fall into.

The first week is a collage of leaving and arriving. I throw out my old deodorant because it makes me smell like a grocery store. I learn how to fold a shirt into a paradox. I learn who can tell a joke while running and who can only make the beginning of one and then finish it hours later with the kind of pride that insists you laugh. I learn that there is a sweet spot between too much water and not enough. I learn that the woman with the freckled geography has a way of making a bed that could keep a secret.

At night, I write in the notebook I promised myself. I use a pen that looks like it has been chewed. I write this: Day one, and also: day none. I make a list of what I brought from home that is not an object. I write: the cranes. I write: Alyx laughing. I write: my mother’s plantains, perfect as myth. I write: the pier at midnight. I write: the way the air conditioner in our apartment clicks like it is trying to speak. I write and, writing, I feel both more and less real, like the difference between seeing a thing and seeing a picture of a thing.

Someone snores. Someone mutters a name. Someone says the word map. I think of lines cut in paper. I think of scissors that know exactly what they were made for. I think of an ocean that does not care what name I choose for it.

There is a dream, late, one I will not tell for a while. In it, I am at the harbor and the cranes lean down to whisper and their breath smells like hot metal and oranges and something else I pretend not to recognize. In it, Alyx is on the high line we never rigged, and she steps out, and below her is not air but a mouth. In it, I put my hands up to catch and I catch something that wasn’t thrown. In it, there is a voice I haven’t heard yet but will, saying, Make it count. Make it cost.

In the morning, the whistle blows and we begin again. I pick up my feet because someone told me that is the only way to get anywhere. I say yes because I think I am strong enough to turn yes into maybe and maybe into mine. I put my hands on the ground. I keep my eyes on the horizon that is not water but behaves like it. I breathe. I throw myself and wait to be caught by the thing I decided could do it.The first thing they teach us is how to stand like we have already decided. There is a way to hold your shoulders that reads as ready even if your stomach thinks about bargaining. There is a way to find your feet and declare them your feet. We line up in a room the color of a bandage and a woman with a voice like a whistle tells us how to become identical without losing our names. She says, “Eyes front,” and we remind our eyes that this is also a direction and not just a habit. We say, “Yes, Drill Sergeant,” and the way we fit the words around our teeth is a test we cannot see.

Mornings arrive like a stranger with a flashlight. The bunks cough and tilt and we put on our faces as if they were part of the uniform. The air smells like floor cleaner that envies the ocean, like canvas warmed by breath, like damp socks that have stories and want to tell them. I learn the language of the room: the way Texas drags his foot when he doesn’t want you to ask if he’s okay, the way Rizzo presses her mouth at the corner like she is keeping a secret in so it doesn’t wander. Franklin doesn’t so much fold his blanket as press it into compliance with the kind of affection you might save for a child who will not sleep. The older man, Arman, says nothing until he says something and then he says exactly what he came to say.

They call me Cirque for a minute and then stop when they see the way I answer to my name like a door. I make myself useful at knots and ropes and any task that asks hands to find each other in the dark. The rope climb is a familiar animal. My body recognizes it as a cousin and behaves. I twist and stand on the loop I’ve made of it and change the knot like it’s a dress. The others learn the steps. We clap for each other because we are being taught to make ourselves into a single organism, and organisms that live like that enjoy the sound of their small, shared victories.

“Stop smiling,” one of the drill sergeants says to me the first time I run the obstacle course. He wears a hat whose brim could be used to check a line for true and a face bony enough to hang rules on. “This is not a parade. This is not your birthday party. I don’t want to see your teeth.”

“That’s just my face,” I say, and then I remember that talking is something I am permitted to do only when it is an assignment. “Yes, Drill Sergeant,” I add, and tuck my mouth in like it can be taught to behave. He watches me over the brim like he knows I am a project and would like to see if I come with instructions.

The obstacle course is monkey bars and crawl spaces and walls that look taller when your legs are tired. There is a low wire that pretends it has the head of a snake. There is a trench with water the color of army men. There are logs that demand balance and pretend they will be kind. It is a game of not stopping, a game I have been playing in my lungs for years. I count without letting my lips move. I count while I am being shouted at, which is not a feat, but it is a practice. I learn who freezes when the ground is wrong and who finds hands where there were none, and who can sing while running, which is a magic trick I respect.

At night, when the lights go out, a small orchestra of snores and coughs and the unmusical percussion of bodies settling performs a piece without a composer. I miss the sound of the pipes at home, the stubborn tick the air conditioner made like it was telling us that if we were quiet enough we would hear how it survived. I miss the cranes over the harbor and the way they dipped their heads, polite despite their size. Here, the only cranes are the helicopters that drag the sky around with them and make the air vibrate in my teeth. When they pass over, the shadow is a shape I have to resist stepping into.

We are given haircuts, all of us, the machine cutting the idea of us into a length that reassures the men in charge. The clippers buzz like bees that have learned one song. Rizzo goes first and handles it like she has already given her hair to something once and it was not the end of the world. I sit and the woman with the razor asks me if I’ve ever had it short before. “No,” I say. “Only in dreams.” The mirror shows me a boy I dated and a girl I wanted to be and a person I haven’t met yet who looks like she knows how to take a blow. When I run my hand over my head later, the noise my palm makes is a dry whisper. It’s not a bad sound. If I had a stage, I would choreograph it into an entrance.

They take our phones and give them back once like bad boyfriends. We stand in a line to call home and the phone in my hand is a warm coin that may or may not buy anything. I call Alyx and the line clicks and she says my name in a way that pours water where there is dust. “You sound different,” she says, and I step to the side as if the sound of me can embarrass the air. “I got a haircut,” I say, and she inhales sharply like she is there and I just took a bite of something spicy.

“Do you hate it?” she asks. The room is loud with other people missing their people. Someone says, “I love you,” like they have been promised a medal for the number of times they can fit it into sixty seconds.

“I don’t hate it,” I say. “It is efficient. I look like someone who irons their socks.”

“I like you inefficient,” Alyx says. “I like you when your hair is getting in your eyes and you blow it away and then lose the beat because you were too pleased with yourself.”

“We have been told there is no beat,” I say. “Just cadence.”

“Cadence is a beat with story problems,” she says. “Are you sleeping?”

“I am sleeping beside strangers who talk in their sleep. I am sleeping like someone who has your name under their tongue and doesn’t want to swallow.”

She is quiet long enough for me to hear the breath of the person two phones down attempting to sob silently. “I drew you a map,” she says finally. “It starts at the Queen Mary and ends nowhere. It’s just lines and the spaces where the lines almost touch. I think it’s how missing works.”

“I would put it under my pillow if that didn’t sound like contraband,” I say. “Put it somewhere safe. We will both need proof later that we were clever.”

The woman with the whistle voice says, “Time,” and I say, “Time,” back because it is a word I want to hold. “I love you,” Alyx says, and it is not a medal but it is a weight that makes my hand feel like a real hand. “I love you,” I say, and I am given the gift of hearing myself mean it.

The gas chamber comes a week later. It is a small concrete building that looks like a room that was not invited to the party. We line up in our masks, black-eyed and insect-like, and are told that it is necessary to learn what happens when the world is not polite. “Trust your gear,” the drill sergeant tells us. He is the one with the brim like a level and the voice that could open cans. “Trust your training. Do not touch your face. Do not be the first to panic.”

The mask holds the shape of my head as if it was made to. We file in and the air inside is already a suggestion of pepper. The grenade goes off with a little pop like a child’s cheek. The cloud is invisible and total. My eyes do not burn at first and I imagine my body is grateful for the hundreds of hours I have spent upside down, teaching blood to listen. Then they tell us to break the seal and there is a second where the world is all throat, all eyes, all betrayal. It’s not that it hurts; it’s that it refuses to be reasoned with. I cough and my cough gives birth to smaller coughs that run like mice. Snot ropes itself out of us and we become the kind of animals we are when we are not being watched. Someone yanks at their mask and earns a hand on their shoulder and the kind of voice that turns into a bridge. “You’re okay,” it says. “You’re okay. Do not run. Walk. Eyes open.”

We walk out and the air outside is a choir and a salad and the interior of a cathedral. I have never loved oxygen so much. We flap our arms because the motion gives the gas other ideas. Texas laughs and then curses because the laugh reincarnates as a cough. Rizzo has tears running into the collar of her shirt and holds her hands away from her face like she doesn’t trust them not to make things worse. I wipe my nose on my sleeve because that is not a sin here. We look at each other like people who have danced a dumb dance and are pretending it wasn’t an initiation. I think of the fabric of the silks and how it cupped me when I fell. I think of how trust is not a feeling but a thing with a buckle.

Combatives is something else entirely. There is a sheen to the mats that speaks of older sweat. A square-shouldered man with a face like a shovel shows us where to put our hands and how to make a fist without involving questions. He demonstrates on Franklin with a gentleness that makes the violence look like a joke. “Fight without hate,” he says, which is not what the posters sell, and I fall a little in love with the idea that this is as practical as tying boots. We pair off and I end up with a woman named Reyes who is compact and efficient and lowers herself onto the mat with the elegance of a dancer who chose a different end to her song. She catches my wrist and turns and my body chooses to follow without letting my mouth vote. We switch. I am told to say, “Kill,” when the moment would demand it, and the word tastes like a coin I found at the bottom of the sea. We say it anyway because sometimes the story is a vowel and you have to make it sound like it belongs to you. Later, when I write in my notebook in the dark, I put “kill” next to “kaleidoscope” like I can get them to behave.

On Sundays we are permitted a small piece of softness to put in our pockets. It looks like a chapel but this is not the kind of military base where the soft thing is necessarily a God, though God is invited and shows up in the shape of chairs where no one will shout at you. I sit on the steps outside because the sun has not been told to maintain discipline and because the air is a complicated thing when left alone. Arman sits beside me and drinks water like it has earned his respect. “I always thought,” he says without preamble, “that obedience was a gift other people were given. Some families know where to stand.” He smiles without showing teeth, like the drill sergeant would be pleased with his restraint. “Turns out you can learn it. You can rent it. You can return it later and get your deposit back.”

“What will you do with the deposit?” I ask. I like this man because he is an old young person and I recognize the species.

“Buy a boat,” he says, then shrugs. “Or a bed. I haven’t decided if I want to leave or arrive.”

My mother’s letter arrives the next day in an envelope with a sticker of a mermaid who would be laughed out of a science class. The handwriting is her handwriting—big, generous, tilted like it would rather lean on you than walk—and the words are my mother, who knows how to make you want to argue and hug her at the same time. She writes about plantains in language that would make a bishop blush. She writes about my father stopping by with a spare tire and a story he cannot tell all the way through. She tells me to be the buffalo, that the buffalo faces the storm because it wants to get through it faster, and also to be the bird, because the bird knows when a storm is actually just a man with a hose. “Do not be a bullet,” she writes again, because her repetition is not an accident. “Bullets only get to be brave once. Then they are lost.” At the bottom she draws a crane badly and I would frame it if I were not pretending not to care. “Call me when the person in charge forgets to watch you,” she writes. “I have fat in the pan.”

I start to help Reyes with her pull-ups. She assists me with my knees during a drill that values knees. We exchange small pieces of ourselves that do not cost either of us much and get used to the way that feels. Franklin shows me how to shave without looking like I attempted a new religion. Texas reveals a picture of a dog so ugly it loops back around to handsome. Rizzo shows us a scar on her shin and tells a story about a street in a city that pretends it wants to eat you until you dance with it like you’ve eaten worse. We fit together like furniture from a store that promises assembly without tools, and then we find the bag of screws no one thought to check.

The nights grow colder and the mornings pretend not to notice. We run and our breath unspools like scarves. We are taught to disassemble and reassemble with our eyes shut because it is important to make friends with parts you cannot see. My hands like this. My hands have always been in favor of touching as a kind of knowing the world understands. There is a day we are given rifles and a man with forearms like history teaches us not to point the barrel at anything we would not invite to leave forever. The weight is different from the weight of a body on my shoulder at the top of the silks, but not so different that my muscles feel lied to. We are instructed to call it a weapon, not a gun, because names are also uniforms. When it kicks, it is a polite kick, like a reminder from a friend not to interrupt.

“Notice the wind,” the instructor says on the range. He has a voice that makes the little hairs at the back of my neck play it cool. “Notice how it touches you. Notice what it does to the grass. Notice that your breath is something you can aim.” He looks at my paper target and then at me. “You have control,” he says, not as a compliment but as a map. “Be careful which river you set that mill on.”

When the letter from Alyx finally comes, it is thick because she never does anything that doesn’t consider the possibility of being a gift. The paper smells faintly of charcoal and something like citrus, which is probably my mind doing me a favor. She writes in the margins, she draws tiny cranes in helmets, she tells me about Oakes pretending to fire a cast member and then hiring him again halfway through the same sentence because it made the joke land. She says the gull with the churros had a rival now, a crow that takes the paper bags with an efficiency that suggests a side hustle. She includes a list titled Things That Are Not Throwing Knives But Could Be If We Wanted Them To, and the list is simply ten drawings of scissors. She tells me about the night she could not sleep and lay on the floor looking at the ceiling and saw a crack that looked like a coastline and named the bays after the times I made her laugh when she wasn’t sure she was allowed. “You are not a person who disappears,” she writes, and I put my forehead on the paper because if I start crying the woman on bunk three will tell me we are not paying her enough for this.

A helicopter comes low enough one afternoon to lift the hats off of us, and I swear its shadow has knees. It hovers and then slides away, elegant and ignorant. The rumor delivers itself on foot: volunteers for airborne training will be accepted after graduation if they meet the marks. Rizzo’s eyes snap to mine like we are both executed by the same thought. “Bird,” she says, and she doesn’t have to say the rest.

That night, my dreams pretend to be tamer. There is a room with a white floor and I am walking it in bare feet, leaving marks like punctuation. Alyx sits on a chair that is also a question. My mother is frying something in a kitchen that speaks Spanish with an accent as thick as sugar. The cranes lean down and are patient. I wake with the taste of metal in my mouth and realize I slept with the tiny knife charm pressed into my palm and that my skin has agreed to be impressed. I keep the charm in my pocket, nest it in the small change, and pretend that makes it official.

We march until the soles of our feet propose new labor laws. The cadence calls do a number on my brain. “Left, right, left, right,” becomes the beat of the day and the hum of what I hear when I sit still. I contact the part of my soul that knows eight-counts and ask it to accept being outvoted. Sometimes the drill sergeant sings the old songs, the ones about drinking and dying and what they tell your mother, and sometimes she invents new ones. “Pick it up,” she says, voice starred with humor she will not acknowledge. “Pick it up, pick it up, try to look like you know what picking up is.” I love her against her will for three minutes and then we are ordered to do push-ups for the crime of existing.

There is a day I forget to pick up my feet and go down hard enough to see a new color. The world tilts to accommodate my narrative and then tilts back. The skin on my knee tears itself into a question and the blood answers with enthusiasm. “Stay down,” Franklin says lightly, and then regret flashes through his expression because we all know the things we are not supposed to say. I am not good at staying down unless someone is above me and the move has a name. I get up. The drill sergeant looks at me the way a lifeguard looks at a wave. “You choose your falls,” she says later, when we are somewhere no one cares what we say. “This will keep you alive and drive someone else insane. Consider which is your problem.” I clean my knee with something that sees pain as a sport and then I go to the range and do better than the day before.

On watch in the middle of the night, the base sounds different. The chain-link fences have their own breath. The stars do not arrange themselves into anything I recognize, which is kind of them. I walk the perimeter of the little world we have been given permission to occupy and think about Long Beach. The way the oil island lights pretend to be a city of their own. The bakery with the saucer pastries that could ruin a person in a specific, honorable way. The street preacher who makes forgiveness sound like a trick you do with your hands. I say Alyx’s name under my breath until it stops hurting, then I stop because repetition has always been a path toward worship and I do not want to make a god of something that wants to stay human.

We are given one hour for laundry and we all pretend life has been waiting for this moment. Rizzo and I sit on the floor, backs against the machines, and listen to the wash try to hammer its way out of work. She tells me about a sister who plays ball like she has a deal with gravity, about her father who tried very hard and then stopped, about how easy it is to hate the airport at your origin story. I tell her not much because my stories are long even when I make them short, and the machines are already doing a lot. She puts her head on my shoulder for a minute and then excuses herself as if she has knocked too hard on a door she likes the look of.

Graduation slides closer with the kind of certainty roller coasters enjoy. Oakes writes me an email through Alyx and it swims through the system and crawls to me half-drowned. “We are building a piece that pretends to break and then doesn’t,” he begins, because he would rather talk about art than me. “If you come back with your edges sharpened, I suppose I will be pleasantly sliced.” He tells me Ellie landed a double and that Dev has learned to juggle his own insecurities with three objects that pretend to be clubs. He signs it with a drawing of a coffee cup tipped over and an arrow that says: this is how I feel when you aren’t around to remind me what time looks like.

We practice for the final ruck march until our calves are the kind of pain poems should be jealous of. They load us with weight to measure our opinions and then they check our opinions against a stopwatch. The world narrows to the next ten steps and then the next ten. A woman ahead of me begins to sing something in a language I do not have and when the rest joins, the song makes room for us like good bread. I find a rhythm that catches under my ribs and ride it. When we finish, the drill sergeant nods once as if she is stamping a passport and says, “Again,” and the plural part of me does not die.

On the last week, they tell us our options. They tell us they are not options so much as doors that have agreed to remain open a minute. My marks are good. My body has agreed to be a team player so far. The airborne slot is a sky that has been described to me in ways that make my skin think it has heard a rumor. The instructor reads my name and looks at me like he is trying to decide which species of bird I am. “You want this?” he asks, and I recognize the test where the correct answer is not on the page. “I want to see if I do,” I say, which is as honest as I know how to be around strangers, and he snorts and hands me a dry piece of paper that will be a wind eventually.

That night I write to Alyx. I tell her about the gas chamber and the way my body agreed to become an orchestra of fluids, about Rizzo’s shoulder under my cheek, about the masks we put on that are not rubber and do not clip. I tell her about the airborne slot and how the idea presses its thumbprint into my chest. I tell her I am afraid of loving a feeling that is mostly gravity with good PR. I tell her these things in complete sentences because that is how we always did it when the thing mattered, but what I mean is not amenable to grammar. I add a note to my mother: “Do buffalo jump?” and I draw a stupid buffalo with wings, and then a bird with horns, and I imagine her cursing laughter when she finds them. I seal the letter with the exhausted seriousness of a person who is trying to make a deal with time.

In the morning, our sergeant makes a speech about transformation that would sound trite in someone else’s mouth. She says we are still ourselves and if anyone tries to take that from us she will personally get in line and throw elbows. She says we have learned something worth not forgetting and something worth refusing to teach to the wrong person. She tells a story about the first time she stood at the door of a plane and told her feet to stop being metaphors. “We need people who can make falling look like a decision,” she says, and I think she has been reading my notebook, and then she laughs at our faces and tells us to drink water.

The day before graduation, the sky breaks in the polite way it does in this state, like someone upstairs had an idea about rain and then lost interest. The ground drinks and complains. We rehearse the march like we are learning to be furniture in a very organized house. I try not to imagine the faces in the crowd because mine will not be there. I have promised myself I will not sacrifice what this is on the altar of what it could have been. I walk, I breathe, I count. At night I press the little knife charm into the soft part of my palm again and memorize the notch it makes. I fall asleep with my hand curled around it like a promise I am keeping in a room where no one would think to look for it.

When I wake, it is still dark, and the air is the kind that might crackle if you spoke too loudly. We dress without talking, we line up in clothes that insist we have achieved something, and I stand beside Rizzo and behind Texas and in front of Franklin and feel the precise geometry of having been scuffed into a shape. The band starts, which is a sentence I never thought I would say from the inside. The flag is a character in this scene and we all accept its lines. We appear. We are observed. The words are spoken and returned. I lift my head and for a second the world is a stage and I am the kind of struck it would be embarrassing to mention. And yet. The breath in my chest is not applause, but it might be the thing that makes it possible.

After, there is that helium feeling you get at the end of a show when the outside rushes in like a dog that was waiting at the door. We shake hands with the people who shouted at us because this is how that relationship performs closure in public. Rizzo’s mother cries with her whole face and then shoves a sandwich at her with the other half of her heart. Texas stares at his father like the word finally found a place to sit. Franklin has a woman in a green dress in his arms who refuses to be graceful about it and I love them in spite of myself. I stand at the edge and drink water and then drink more water and try to figure out how to hold my body with nothing to push against.

I look up at the sky and it is exactly as indifferent as it was yesterday. Somewhere far away, the sun hits the cranes over the harbor with a metal kiss. If I squint I can see them dipping and rising, rehearsing gentleness, reminding me that nothing big is automatically unkind. The bus to airborne is smaller, less dramatic, like an apology that comes too fast. I heft my bag and it feels like an old conversation. Rizzo slaps my palm and says, “Bird,” and I say, “Buffalo,” back because it is funny now, and because she will make me pay later.

I step onto the bus and the driver looks at us all the same and that feels fair. I sit by the window and watch the base fold itself up and slide behind us. There is a once-famous song on the radio that insists we should not stop believing, and someone in the back sings softly in a voice that would get them hired for a job where singing is a credential. I take out my notebook and write, “Door,” and then I write, “Yes,” and these are not enough words but they will have to stand here and hold the place.

We go. The road is a muscle and the wheels are the way it flexes. The sky is a lid that does not mind being lifted. We breathe together like a class with no teacher. I lean my head against the glass and count telephone poles until the numbers lose track of me. Somewhere between here and the place where we will be told the names of the things we will be jumping out of, I fall asleep, and in the dream Alyx is holding a silk like a river and my mother is frying plantains beside a window, and the cranes finally figure it out and land, and the ground holds.Chapter 4 starts on a bus that smells like old jackets and beginnings, the windows rattling in their frames like they are applauding us without committing to a standing ovation. The road tilts and rights itself, and the sky rides along pretending it can’t hear how many stomachs are trying to decide if they are brave. Rizzo sleeps with her mouth open in a way that would embarrass her if she could see it, and Texas taps his heel in a rhythm that says his nerves are bilingual. I lean my head against the glass and watch the land change its clothes. The trees get shorter, then taller. The dirt goes from a shock of red to a brown that takes its vitamins. Somewhere a river is practicing its cursive where I cannot see it. I count telephone poles until they become legs of a long animal pacing us.

The gate has arches that make a promise with their shape. The sign swallows us in its mouth and calls us something on purpose. There are posters, not the glossy kind with bared teeth and hands gripping rifles for the camera, but old ones that look like they’ve been telling the truth long enough to be bored with it. Wings spread over a circle of words that mean Go Up and Come Down Without Being Embarrassing. The buildings are low and purposeful, like they have seen thousands of stories pass in and out and have agreed not to gossip. The air smells like pine needles ground down by boots, and like that particular dust that seems proprietary to places where falling is considered a skill set.

The instructors wear hats that flatten their eyes into shadows. Later I will learn that the hats matter here the way a ribbon matters in a dance you are trying not to trip over. Now it’s the voice that matters. It is not the shout of basic. It is a different frequency, a kind of whistled gravity. “You will put hands where we tell you,” a man says from beneath his brim, so even his words have to duck to clear it. “You will remember that gravity is fair. It does not care if you cried last night. It does not care if you won a trophy at a circus show. It will give you exactly what you asked for and then a little more to see if you flinch.”

I don’t look at Rizzo, which is how you love someone in a room where love would be treated like contraband. I touch the little knife charm in my pocket and let my thumb find the notch. I see a tower over the roofs, white and skeletal, like a crane that forgot which harbor it belonged to and decided the sky was close enough. My heart performs a small audition for itself and then stands back with its arms folded.

Ground Week is the week where we learn to believe in dirt. They march us to a field with pits of sawdust that smell like a carpentry project with too many uncles. There are rigs that look like they were built by the same person who invented excuses. The Swing Landing Trainer is a metal frame with a seat that pretends to be a parachute’s stubborn little cousin. We line up under the sun that is on contract with someone else and watch the first unlucky volunteer get hauled up and then dropped in a way that is both gentle and insulting. The drop is not high. It is not low. It is the exact height designed to make your brain rehearse a scream and then feel silly for having rehearsed.

“Feet and knees together,” the man says, like he is reciting a recipe. “Chin tucked. Hands on the risers until I say otherwise. Five points of performance: balls of the feet, side of the calf, side of the thigh, hip, lat. Kiss the earth with the bored part of your body. Nothing flirty. Nothing stupid. If you reach back, you will pay, and I’m not accepting coupons.”

This is how I know he’s good. He makes the instructions sound like the kind of liturgy you can practice until your mouth remembers it when you have run out of mouth. I go up when it’s my turn and I am not above being charmed by the way the harness bite feels like seriousness. Circus harnesses cut you into someone who remembers. This one is less interested in aesthetics and more in introducing itself to organs I have never had cause to think about. When they drop me, I listen. I arrange my bones into a sentence I can live with. I do not reach back. I roll like someone who has spent a lifetime making sure the floor is a colleague and not a rival. The sawdust fills my collar and tries to pretend it belongs to me.

The unkind thing about the harness is not the pressure on the hips, though that is a bruise that will arrange itself into parentheses and whisper side comments whenever I sit down. It is the diagonal that insists on your attention, the web of straps that teach you where your edges are. The risers kiss your fingers across the glove and promise to be there when the air decides to show up as fabric. The first time they lower me wrong on purpose so I will learn to recover without making a fuss, my left elbow offers an opinion and my right shoulder negotiates. I tuck, I turn, I allow. I am a student again and it is a relief I do not say out loud.

We memorize the PLF like it’s a song with embarrassing lyrics and a beat you cannot admit you like. We stand on low platforms and fall until each of us finds the version of ourselves who dislikes drama. The Black Hats nod or shake their heads like they are deciding which of us would be good at packing a parachute with bad news inside and sending it to an enemy. Rizzo goes with that short, determined jaw of hers, like she could outstare the ground into generosity. She falls clean, gets up dirty, and gives me a look that lands somewhere between “I can’t believe we chose this” and “Of course we chose this.”

At chow, the eggs are the color of a decision someone else made. The pancakes would rather be named something else and are waiting for their chance. The syrup tastes like compliance and does not apologize. We shovel fuel into our small private fires and then we are marched back out to tell the air we are ready to bargain. Texas tells a joke about a man who jumps out of a plane with a backpack full of laundry and I laugh too hard and choke on coffee that didn’t intend to be breathed. Rizzo thumps my back once, then twice, with the delicacy of a friend who knows the exact amount of violence you need to stop making things worse.

It rains one afternoon, a brief, efficient rain that drags the smell of metal out of everything. The pits drink and complain. The trainers shrug, because falling and water are old co-workers. We keep falling. We exit the mock doors until the hinges beg for reprieve. We are drilled on the count you say to yourself when you step into the idea of sky. One-thousand, two-thousand, three-thousand, four. We learn what it is to find your canopy with your eyes and argue with it until it is a shape you can live with. “Check your six,” the instructor says, and I do, and I think of how many times I have said that in a theater when the rigging wasn’t happy and the lights were being dramatic for free.

I write to Alyx in the sliver of three a.m. where sleep has been outlawed but our bodies haven’t got the memo. I tell her about my hips, which are turning into a field guide to new blushes of pain. I tell her about the way the instructors smell like the inside of a parachute bag—canvas and old adrenaline and a soap that has war with dirt in the title. I tell her Ground Week feels like warm-up, like plies for the air. “I never liked pliés,” she writes back. “I liked the part where you jump and everybody’s ankles confess. Do you forget my face?” I tell her the truth, which is that forgetting is not my talent. “You didn’t bring an instrument,” she writes in the margin, next to a tiny drawing of a woman being lifted by a parachute that looks suspiciously like a jellyfish. “So I will remind the air how to hold you by singing at it from here.”

My mother’s letter arrives with a faint smell of fried sugar because she is the kind of woman who does not believe in sealing a message without feeding it. She writes that Lito says the new neighbors argue in the doorway like they are allergic to thresholds and that she has begun naming the pigeons for famous theologians just to see if they get better posture. “Buffalo and bird,” she repeats, because she likes to braid a lesson until it creaks. “Remember that some men long ago pushed buffalo off cliffs because the buffalo trusted one of them to go first with bravery. If you are first, make sure you have not been hired by the wrong story. If you are last, make sure you are not being polite to your fear.” She draws a crane again and confesses she used a ruler this time and it still looks like a chair that forgot its job. I press my mouth to the place where the ink bled because my body has to kiss something and paper will do in a pinch.

Tower Week is a rumor until it isn’t. We march toward the shape we’ve been pretending not to count and then there it is, white and insistent, the exact height someone decided was the number your brain would not argue with. Thirty-four feet, they tell us, like a birthday you are approaching with trepidation. “This,” the instructor says, patting the metal doorframe like it is his favorite animal, “is where your feet learn to ignore your instincts. This is where the word go stops being a theory.” The wind at that height is not the same wind as on the ground; it has opinions that it did not ask permission to share. The platform is a mouth and we are the small necessary words.

I have stepped into air for applause. I have done it with silk around my waist and chalk on my palms and the eyes of strangers waiting to decide if what I do is art or simply a person misusing fabric. This is not that. This is the industrial version, the standardized test, the air with a rubric. The Black Hat clips me in, checks with the small efficiency of a person who has organized a hundred tragedies into training opportunities and is determined to keep the number where it is. He taps my shoulder and I step out like I have been practicing in the dark. The harness grabs me under the blessing of physics and the zip of the line takes over. For a second, my stomach writes a letter to my hands encouraging desertion. Then we are moving, and motion is a relief that feels like honesty.

The ground comes at me with the smugness of a thing that believes in itself, and I make my body into the answer key we have been given. Feet and knees together. Chin tucked. Eyes like you mean it. The impact is not nothing. It is a conversation. I have had worse conversations with kinder partners. I roll and come up with gravel in my mouth and a grin I am ordered to disown. “Save it for after,” the Black Hat says, and I put my smile away like a contraband fruit I will eat behind a building later with sticky hands.

They hang us in the individual harness rigs and shake us like maracas until we learn how to dress a line twist without swearing at anyone who cannot help us. We practice cutting away the boyfriend we didn’t mean to bring to the party. We call the reserve our last good idea and spend more time than is polite staring at it like either it will introduce itself or it will call the police. Rizzo gets pulled in front of a group for having the cleanest PLF in our class and when she steps down, she lets her hand graze mine like a woman who has agreed to live.

At night, I dream in cords and webbing. The canopy spreads its white sheet over my head and whispers to me in the language of nylon. The cranes from home arrive with jump wings pinned to their chests, which looks foolish and somehow right, and they step off the tower because what else can a tall thing do? Alyx is below, her arms a net, and my mother stands on the ground holding a plate of plantains she promises to throw at me if I forget who I said I was going to be. I wake with the taste of salt and the memory of falling, which is the same memory I have of being held.

On Sundays, the sky pretends to be merciful and we are allowed to call. The phone hums like an insect in my hand. Alyx answers on the first ring as if she has been sitting with the idea of my voice like it is a small bird she could warm. She doesn’t say hello. She says, “Tell me how the tower is different from the rig.” I tell her it is louder in its logic, that it doesn’t behave, that the instructor’s hands are fast and gentle and that I am surprised each time the ground does exactly what it said it would. “I am drawing you as a series of planes,” she says. “Not airplanes. Surfaces. Your cheeks. The line of your calf. The angle of your hip where the harness presumes to have jurisdiction. If I draw all your angles separately, maybe I will understand how to put you back together here.”

“Save the drawing,” I say, like there will be a museum for our survivals. “Hang it where the neighbor’s dog can bark at it.”

“He barks at the cranes now,” she reports. “He decided they were in charge and he is not having it. We saw a gull steal a hot dog. Oakes got a gig at the fairgrounds that pays in tickets and corn. He wants to put you on the poster like a promise, which we both know is unethical.”

“Tell him to promise a question instead,” I say, and she laughs, and the laugh travels the wire like it knows how to do it without losing parts. “My mother,” I add, “says if I jump I should do it like a buffalo who took a nap first.”

“She is trying to speak your body into being a plan,” Alyx says. “She is not wrong. I’m putting a sugar packet in my pocket for you. It will turn into something by the time you get back. Everything does.”

Jump Week announces itself without a big speech. The board changes. Our schedule rearranges its bones. The Black Hats walk with a particular private joke pulling at their mouths. They weigh us with our gear and we become small planets orbiting our own mass. The parachute is not a metaphor now. It is a pack with the weight of a bad decision you intend to make good on. It sits on my back like a stubborn child. The reserve snuggles against my stomach, too intimate and not intimate enough. The static line snakes down and looks harmless in a way that insults both of us.

We stand in the hangar and practice until the words become a room we can live in. Stand up. Hook up. Shuffle to the door. Check static line. Sound off with last name and number. Eyes to the horizon. Wait. Wait. Yes. The Black Hat drills us until even Texas’s jokes fall apart with missing pieces. We have been told, helpfully, that our first jump will be at the exact moment we will least want to do it. “Wanting is extra,” the instructor says, which is an excellent way to ruin an advertisement and teach survival in the same breath. I find my place in the line and watch the door as if it has something to say about me we will all agree is accurate.

The airplane, when it comes, is a room that forgot to finish itself. We are strapped in, and then we are not, and the floor vibrates with a confidence I envy. The loadmaster is a man whose expression has been ironed into neutrality. The world outside the open door is candy-colored and impersonal. The air presses its hand over my face like a friend who is afraid of me ruining my own surprise. The noise is a long math problem to which the answer is the hunger in my teeth. We taxi, which feels like being asked to make a speech with a mouthful of nails. We ascend. The straps bite. The light is red, indifferent. My cheeks vibrate. Rizzo’s knee knocks mine once. I make my body small inside the equipment like a guest in a house built by a stranger.

“Stand up,” the Black Hat says, and we stand up because the body remembers how. “Hook up.” The static line clips in with a sound like the lid on a box where you kept your better self. “Check static line.” Hands touch the line gently, like you would touch a sleeping animal whose dreams you respect. “Check equipment.” We pat ourselves like we’re ashamed. “Sound off,” and voices ring down the line, names turning into numbers and back into names. The light is red. The light is still red. The light is—green.

I do not think. Thinking is a room with a window at the wrong height. I shuffle. I am the third in the stick, a number that suddenly feels lucky enough to be superstition. The door is a mouth and I am a word with consonants I trust. The jumpmaster’s hand is a square that promises and orders at once. I step into the space where the plane ends and the story begins. There is a violence of wind that is an argument I was warned about and chose to ignore. There is the count I have taught my throat to respect. One-thousand. Two-thousand. Three-thousand. Four. My fingers on the risers find a job and everything in the world above me blossoms.

Canopy, I think, and then I do not have to think it because it is a fact with weight and shape. The silk—or the not-silk, the nylon, the material that is not my performance partner but has agreed to play the part—fills and shudders, checks its own lines like it is willing to take responsibility for its past. I look up because that is one of the things you do and because in my worst dreams the canopy is a question, not an answer, and this one answers. It is full. It is above me. It is a sky that has agreed to be a ceiling for a minute for reasons of safety. The noise drops out of the world like someone closed a door on a party next door and I am alone with air and the way my own breath sounds inside my head. The ground, which from the plane was a rumor, is a hypothesis I intend to test.

I check my six because the instructors are not wrong and because out here your friends are also your traffic. Rizzo is a white flower to my left, a good distance, turning a little because the wind is that kind of conversationalist. I pull the rear risers gently and the canopy listens like a good student. The wind puts the taste of faraway pine on my tongue. The history of this place hums in my shoulder blades. I am not falling. I am being lowered by a patient hand that only became patient after years of practice, and the practice belongs to other women's hands and men's hands and hands whose owners might not approve of me. I hold both gratitude and theft in my palms and call it a grip.

The ground returns to its old trick of approaching faster in the last inch. That is its temperament. We have been taught to humor it. I put my feet and knees together and I tell my chin a secret, and the earth lays a hand on me that is intimate in a way I would not permit a stranger. We roll it out, we end up in a calligraphy of prints, and I am laughing before I stand up because my body is rude about joy. I gather the canopy like a bridal train in a wind that mispronounces my name. I clean my lines, I hold my breath when I am told, I take one long breath when I am told to. The Black Hat is grinning now because he is allowed to grin when you are not looking and because the first jump is a kind of song that teaches itself to you whether you wanted a melody in your mouth or not.

We jump again. We jump until the idea of being inside a plane begins to feel like a prologue someone forgot to edit. The plane and I negotiate in our new language of exits and forgiveness. The fourth jump is at twilight and the world below is a map for a creature who has decided to learn reading for love. The fifth is a day that thinks it is summer, and the air smells like everything that will ever happen to me at once. I land and there is a moment where my left ankle considers inventing a new hobby, and I talk to it in my head the way you talk to a cat deciding the top of the refrigerator is the only rational place to be. It relents. I get up. I say thank you to the canopy because I am from a household of women who talk to kitchen appliances and expect to be heard.

The wings pin is small and vulgar and exactly the kind of thing you understand only after you have negotiated with gravity in a public way. They stand us in a line and those hats and those hands and those eyes make us into people who have been given permission to wear a weight on our chests. The slap is the worst part and the best part. It is theater, but it is our theater. Rizzo whispers “Bird” and I whisper “Buffalo” and both words taste like salt. The sun is a bully and a blessing and we let it do what it does.

That night, my shoulders ache in the old, beloved way, like they miss the silks and believe these lines are cousins we have to call by their married names. The bunk is the same as it was at basic, which is to say it is a truce. I write to Alyx with the tired hands of someone who has made herself into a new set of lines today. I tell her about the door and how it is not a metaphor when you stand inside it. I tell her about the canopy opening above me with a sigh you feel in your teeth. I tell her about the way the land held out its arms and caught me like a friend who wants to be told everything later. I draw a little square and write “door” next to it and then shade it in and write “yes.”

Her reply will take days. When it comes, I will open it like a person who has been practicing gentle all week and wants to make sure she remembers what gentle is for. For now, I sleep and the cranes come back, even here, landing at last with the fussy surprise of big things that have learned to be careful. They tuck their legs and become shapes that can be held. They fold the air into origami and pretend it is a peace treaty. Somewhere far off, the ocean I was born beside tells its same joke: come closer, it says, I am the same and I am new. I roll onto my side, careful of the new parentheses on my hips, and put the little knife charm under my tongue like a prayer I intend to keep sharp.Chapter 6 begins with leave that feels like a book you borrowed from a friend you love and know you will return with a crease they will pretend not to notice. The orders come folded in a way that makes them look kinder than they are, and I stand in a hallway where feet try not to echo and read the date like it might migrate. Rizzo high-fives me with the same hand she used to check her risers, and Texas tells me to eat something shaped like a funnel while I can. I pack slow, because slow makes it a ritual and rituals are what you do when you need to teach your nervous system a new song. The little knife charm clicks against the pen in my pocket like two cousins who are not sure which one of them is older, and the bus that will take me to an airport with a name both patriotic and practical sighs like it knows who it is carrying.

The airplane’s hum glosses the edges off my thoughts until each one looks like a pebble someone threw into a river and then forgot to watch sink. Out the window the landscape arranges itself into quilts and arguments and then clouds decide they were here first. My hair has grown two-thirds of an apology, enough to fuzz my scalp and remind my hand of its new choreography when I reach up without thinking. I sleep with my mouth open because everyone does and wake because a child kicks the back of my seat gently like he is practicing the discipline of persistence. The crew hands us pretzels in bags that act offended by how easy they are to open, and the woman in the aisle seat asks me where I am going and I tell her home and mean two places at once. She nods like she is in the club and talks about a brother who collects patches and a mother who collects phone calls and does not know which is heavier.

Long Beach appears first as a plot twist in the light and then as a specific heat that climbs its way up my sleeves. The cranes are there, of course, because even on days when I pretend they are metaphors, they insist on being steel. Their necks dip and rise like the skyline has been rehearsing its curtsy. The air at the curb tastes like salt that went to school: educated, social, still a little rude. Alyx is late by exactly the number of seconds she will deny if I bring it up later, and when she runs toward me her arms do that thing where they forget their bones are theoretical and decide they will do the job of ribs. We collide in public like the world assigned us that verb and gets a cut of our joy. Her hair smells like charcoal and citrus and the soap the convenience store sells that is famous for its lies, and she puts her hand on the back of my head and laughs into my neck and I forgive six nonrelated things because she remembered where to find the switch that turns on the light for the part of me that has been dimming.

“You look like you lost a bet and won a different one,” she says when she finally leans back enough to see my face, and I show her the bruise parentheses the harness left on my hips like it wanted in on the conversation and she rolls her eyes at gravity like they have a history.

We drive home with the windows down because the car doesn’t believe in working that hard. Pine Street is itself, too sure of its own name to be anything else. The street preacher is there, mint-breathed and nimble with the parts of regret that can be told aloud. The wig shop window has a wig with a hat on a wig with a hat like the owner got into a disagreement with recursion and refused to blink first. The man with the lighthouse on his neck reads a scene from a play to a group of gulls who have begun to prefer iambic pentameter. When we pass the bakery, all the pastries watch us with frosting eyes and I decide I will be merciful to at least two of them at a later hour.

Our apartment argues only a little with the new me I bring into it. The pipes remember their rhythm, the windows keep their south-facing loyalties, the floorboards complain like uncles. Alyx has annexed a corner with a drawing that stretches in butcher paper from the wall up to the railing of our loft, an accumulation of angles and planes that suggest a person without betraying her face. She has labeled parts in pencil in handwriting that slants like it’s looking for a fight it knows it will win later. Cheekbone (unknown future), left calf (proof of flight), collarbone (keys). I run my finger over the charcoal’s edge and come away black and pleased. She watches me watch it and I can see the questions line up behind her eyes like they are waiting to be introduced at a party we both agreed to attend sober.

“Do you want to climb?” she asks, and by climb she means the silks, the theater, the part of me that used to live on a red river with a chalk-blood map in my palms. The question sits in the air like a test that will not leave until one of us fills a blank.

“Yes,” I say, because there’s no future in borrowing the truth for occasions, and we walk the short three blocks to the warehouse that has learned to hum with us and for us. Oakes is there, of course, because he has installed himself in the supervisory orbit of his own ambition. He sees me and his face does the math of three expressions at once and then lands on a fourth I can’t name. He pretends to ignore the hair and the way my shoulders have learned new equations and instead announces we are running the new piece without the part where the audience loses the thread and goes to see about nachos.

He puts me with Alyx because he isn’t a fool and because he is. We rig the red fabric and my hands remember the knot as if the knot has been sending letters to my muscles weekly in my absence. The first climb slides under my skin so smoothly I almost distrust it. My ribs say hello to the inhale they were born to count. Alyx’s voice comes up to me in pieces, the same way orders did, and I have to remind myself I am not required to swallow anything I do not choose. At the top, there is the old love: the sit, the wrap, the drop that is a negotiation I have never been bored with. The floor comes up like an argument, and I handle it with the practiced gratitude of someone who knows the choreography of not dying.

Halfway through a sequence that used to live in our bones, Ellie skids and sits hard and then tries to stand and something in her ankle says a word none of us like. She breathes the specific way of people who are trying not to give the air more to do and my body moves before my mouth reports in. I slide down, clean, and kneel, and my hands perform the assessment I was taught in a fluorescent-lit room while a woman with whistle voice made sure we understood this part of the world. Ellie’s face shines with a sheen that is more about dignity than sweat. Her ankle is already rupturing its belief in singularity. I touch, I ask, I press, I hold, I tell her the dumb jokes you tell when someone needs a harbor that will not make noise. We elevate as if we are inviting it to grow new laws. Oakes hovers like a crane that cannot decide where to land.

“This is why I left,” I say, weirdly, not because I wanted her to hear me but because my mouth is not always a team player. “So this part of me would have something to point at while it figured out who else I could be.”

Ellie says, “Your bedside manner is exactly what it was when you told me to breathe through my throat,” and I am both forgiven and assigned new labor. Pigeon and Dev turn up with tape and a desire to be helpful that is a meal we all share. We secure, we make a plan, we call a person with a car who will not hit every pothole out of spite. Alyx watches me watch myself do the useful thing, and later when we are alone she puts her hand against the back of my neck and leaves it there like she doesn’t want to spook anything that has just decided to return.

In the evening the radio at the warehouse is still in love with summers that have been sold back to us. Oakes pretends that politics have not infiltrated our floor even though war is in the room by the light switch and refuses to leave. He makes three changes to the new piece because crisis has clarified his preferences. We run the sequence again and my body behaves with a familiarity that thinks it is kindness. When the applause comes from our small audience of people who are paid to clap with their eyes, it occupies a different square in my head than the applause from a line of hats and hands and pins. Both squares are real estate I pay on time for. Both squares jury-rig me to the right now.

My mother insists on a night that will taste like a decision we didn’t have to make. We go to her apartment, which smells like everything she can cook, which is to say it smells like a promise she is willing to keep in front of witnesses. She opens the door already talking, already scolding me for what she might decide I have done later, already kissing me once like a hurricane and twice like a lifeguard. She touches my hair as if it is an animal she read about and is unsure if it bites. She presses my cheeks between her hands like a jury. Then she feeds me plantains that curl at the edges and beans that think they are inventing music and rice that doesn’t argue with anyone. Lito sits at the table like a man who has discovered a new planet and doesn’t want to be arrogant about it. He tells me about a truck that didn’t want to be a truck and I tell him about a door that kept its promise to be a door even when the floor gave up, and he bangs the table once with satisfaction in a way that convinces me the table had it coming.

My mother listens to me with her eyes exactly on my mouth, as if afraid the words will jump and she will have to catch them. When I tell her about the tower, she crosses herself with the kind of efficiency only repetition can teach and then wipes her fingers on her apron like even blessings leave a residue. “And the buffalo,” she says, because she likes her narrative with returning characters and because she has decided that our household will not stop speaking animal into human things. “Did you remember the lesson about the cliff when the buffalo all ran together?”

“I remembered,” I say. “I counted, too, and counting never saved anyone but it makes you look like someone who can be trusted while you make the leap.”

She sends me home with fried something wrapped in foil and advice wrapped in noise. On the way out, we pass my father on the sidewalk, or the man who wears his shape like a borrowed coat. He reaches out as if he might adjust my collar and then thinks better of it because he did not bring the right hands today. He looks at Alyx with polite jealousy and at me with the kind of love men think no one can see if they say nothing. He says he is proud in the voice of someone who paid late and is asking for the fee to be forgiven, and I say thank you because that is the only word that both protects the present and keeps the future out of jail.

The next day I go to the beach by myself because solitude needs practice, too. The breakwater lies like a law we forgot to vote on. The oil islands blink their theatrical lashes and pretend they are not working harder than anyone else without ever breaking a sweat. The water is a color that would be called something like bottle or sorrow by a person who believes in naming things in ways that will make them easier to sell. I run my fingers through the sand until my nails are small shovels. The gulls argue about a French fry like it has opinions worth respecting. I breathe in the ocean until my lungs ask for something with corners, and then I breathe out again and watch a child chase a line of foam until the foam turns and tells him the story about how fast it can run when it has help.

Alyx joins me after the hour she reserves daily for fighting her drawings into more honest shapes. She drops beside me like gravity finally filed the paperwork. We share the foil bundle my mother sent like it is a sacred text we can only open together. She keeps her shoulder against mine like a plug against a leak and we watch a man carve a long, serious message into the wet sand with a stick until the water erases it with the impassive efficiency of time. This is the part where a person says something important to make the moment hold still, but we have learned not to punch holes in quiet just because we like the noise.

“Do you know where they’ll send you?” she asks finally, because intimacy without questions is just furniture.

“There are names,” I say. “Places that eat boots and places that spit them back. A big division with a number and a song, probably. They like songs.”

“Will there be a door?” she asks, and I love her for choosing the detail that matters.

“There will be so many doors we will forget to keep count unless we do it on purpose,” I say. “The first one will look like a mouth. The second one will look like a mouth. Many of them will look like a mouth.”

She nods and puts a piece of sea glass in my palm and closes my fingers over it like an oath. “This one is the color of a yes that did not get us in trouble,” she says, and the way she smiles makes the gulls reconsider their priorities.

Oakes throws us a small homecoming performance on the roof because he wants to keep the word home in his mouth and because he has never met an excuse he won’t teach to behave like a curtain. He sends a message to our ragged list, and the six people who always show and the seven who never do both arrive. He strings the lights in a way that suggests he is auditioning for a job as a constellation. The cranes do their part, standing taller than decorum and pretending to be indifferent while being very aware of their angles. We climb, not high because the roof is a negotiation with municipal rules, but high enough to make the air feel invited. Alyx and I do the series we call the promise because once we named it we had to keep it. My mother stands in a corner with Lito, both of them clapping in a way that tells the night not to try anything. Pigeon emcees until someone takes the microphone away because he has yet to meet a sentence that doesn’t want to be a parade. The city makes that low, forgiving noise that big things make when they are trying to be good.

I catch Alyx out of a drop we never used to risk because someone taught me a new thing about knees and where to put your weight and how to hide the bruise behind the applause, and the collective intake of breath the audience makes is the kind of currency I will always be a little deranged about. After, Oakes makes a speech about art that includes the words spinal column, forgiveness, and budget in a way that should not work and mostly does. He gives me a coffee mug with the words You Are Here written on the bottom so you have to drink to see the punchline, and I put it in my bag like a talisman I will drink from in rooms that are more fluorescent than any God intended.

We pack my duffel two days early because it feels better to stare the leaving in its face than to be jumped by it in a hallway. Alyx folds my shirts in a geometry that would convert a heretic, and I put the knife charm into the small inner pocket where I keep my breath mints and things I love that do not look like love to strangers. We do that dance lovers do where you pretend the chore of packing is sex and the sex is a chore and both are a way to handle the fact that goodbye is not a word that belongs to either of you but one that lives in the mouths of loud neighbors. She tucks a drawing into the middle of my stack of socks, the one of me as planes, and says don’t look at it until you need to, which is either a cruel or generous instruction depending on the day. I tuck a note into her tea tin that says, in the smallest letters my pen can make, I am learning to be a room with windows, and hope she will not read it while she is boiling water because I do not want her to blame water for my choices.

On the last night, the neighbor’s dog chooses to be silent as if it has taken on the weight of what we aren’t saying and is trying to help. We walk to the pier like truth is sold at the end of it and you have to stand in line. The men fishing at midnight have the patience of philosophy and the language of work. The lit ferris wheel on the tourist island pretends to be a clock that tells the time of a better idea. We lean against the railing and count the small lights that announce ships that have chosen not to come in tonight because every harbor has a personality and ours is passive-aggressive. Alyx tells me a story about a girl who made a kite so large it lifted the whole neighborhood and they all had to pretend they meant to be above themselves for a while. I tell her a story about a woman whose mouth refused to learn the word no until the day it needed to say it to a person who looked like her mirror and then it learned very fast and made up for all the practice it did not get. We do not say I am scared because saying it makes it a guest and we are trying to keep the apartment quiet after hours.

The morning wakes us like we are a parade that forgot to ask for a permit. My bag looks smaller than it felt last time. Alyx wears the jacket with the too-big pockets because she thinks she can keep more of me if she has somewhere to put her fists. My mother texts a picture of plantains with a caption in which every word is a different amount of caps and then tells me to call when the person in charge has to pee. The bus station smells like burnt coffee and the sighs of deliberate people. There is a woman crying in a stall and a child singing under his breath and a man who thinks his phone call is a public service and the ghost of a teenager I used to be hoping her mother would turn around and see the new piercings. The bus arrives pretending it is more heroic than it is, and I love it for lying about the right part of itself.

We sit together until the men in hats tell us to get in line because lines are one of their love languages. Alyx puts her hands on my cheeks like a person who believes faces can be rearranged into more favorable outcomes if you apply enough warmth. She says, “Write,” and I say, “Jump,” and we both mean, “Live.” We kiss the way you kiss when you know the train schedule and don’t care. She presses something into my palm, a packet of sugar from a diner with a picture of a desert on it, and tells me not to open it until I am somewhere that insists I don’t need it. I say yes to her because it is the only questionable contract I have ever signed that did not require a witness.

On the bus, my seatmate is a woman whose hair is the exact length where women are mistaken for boys by people who cannot imagine their way out of a uniform. She reads a book about a mountain where nothing happens unless you look at it. We talk easily for the first ten minutes and then confess we are reserving our hearts for people we already promised them to. I press my forehead to the glass and watch Long Beach turn into a sheet of paper I can fold later if I need to remember the right way to make a swan. The cranes are standing in a posture I have decided means approval and disapproval at the same time. The water pretends to be occupied with a different horizon. Alyx gets smaller and smaller and then becomes a different kind of light entirely, the kind that lives in the place where your ribs meet and discuss the news. I take out my notebook and write the names of things that will not change no matter where I go: plantains, cranes, the way the mat smells when someone has been cautious with it, the way my hand fits into the small of Alyx’s back like it was cut there by a woman with scissors who knows what hands are for.

At the new place, the signs trade me between arrows until I have no idea who I owe. The base is a reality show with all the narrative edited out, just rooms and uniforms and the sound of boots applauding sidewalks. They assign me a bed, a locker, a place to be when a trumpet tells me getting there on time will be the difference between being a person and being a problem. The unit is a collection of faces with work behind them. There is a woman who tells me to call her Dove because her real last name sounds like it was invented by a person who enjoys consonants. There is a man who has a tattoo of a long road on his forearm with mile markers that could be dates or bodies and he calls everyone by their last names like he was paid not to care. There is a sergeant who doesn’t need to shout to make the room behave, and I realize, with the relief of people who are tired of being surprised by competence, that I will be fine if I do not lie to her and also if I do.

We run until my legs remember that the ground here is differently opinionated. The air has a taste like someone forgot to add the salt. The cadence caller in this place likes to invent days of the week to trick our feet into giving up. There are doors with bigger planes behind them than I have met yet and there are doors with nothing behind them at all, just the idea that you should learn to push before you ask permission. I write to Alyx at night when the overhead lights pretend they know what softness is. I tell her the unit feels like a complicated kitchen where everyone knows when to hand you the spoon. I tell her I miss her laughter, the kind that does not always look pretty but always looks like relief, and she writes back that she misses mine, the dime-store version of it, the cheap laugh I will still buy if it makes her ankle remember what not-hurting is.

On weekend liberty the first time, a storm rolls over the training area like a rumor that decided to be right. The sky is a sheet of steel that someone considered polishing and then decided the scratches gave it character. We are told to stay close because the lightning here has a list of names and wants to check them off, and the men who know about these things say your name too slowly when they say it for you to pretend not to recognize the syllables. I take my shower like someone trying to memorize the temperature of forgiveness and sit on a bench in a hallway where a fan spins with missionary fervor. Rizzo calls. Her voice arrives with static wearing a skirt.

“I got sent south,” she says, and the way she says south sounds like she found out the word has teeth. “They asked me if I wanted it and I said yes so fast they assumed I misunderstood the question. I’m learning that yes is a volunteer with very sharp elbows.”

“Do you have wings with sand in them yet?” I ask, and she laughs and coughs and laughs, and I wish my hands were a map that included roads I could throw down under her feet like carpets.

“Tell me a good thing that isn’t food,” she says, because she knows me and because lately all my metaphors come with calories. I tell her about the woman in my platoon who can take apart a radio blindfolded while keeping a joke alive with the other half of her brain. I tell her about the man who tucks a Bible into his ankle sock like prisoners tuck shanks, for luck or for a weapon against loneliness. I tell her about the way the paratrooper badge looks stupid on everyone for exactly one day and then starts to grow into its shape as if it is a cactus and we have been watering it with attention.

“Bird,” she says before we hang up, and I say, “Buffalo,” because even as the words get mean where she is, we promised those names would belong to us wherever we ended up.

The weeks unscroll like film that someone stored badly and is now trying to play for us without admitting it has tears. There are days we wear our gear like a joke about heaviness and sing songs that left their melody back in a classroom somewhere. There are days we fly and leave the ground to its own devices. There are nights we are called into a room and shown maps that look like pieces of the inside of someone’s mouth, soft and necessary, and asked to imagine paths through them. I find that the counting helps even when the numbers do not make the choices for me. The knife charm lives against my thigh like the fact of a yes I do not have to share to make it real.

On a morning when the fog forgets it doesn’t live here, I open Alyx’s drawing for the first time and spread it on the bed, which is a public act no matter how private you pretend it to be in a room with walls that listen. The planes of me look like different women told to meet under a streetlight and explain what they have in common. She has labeled a place on my hip Harness Authority, which makes me snort and then press my hand there like I have a say. Under my left eye she has written: This one counts. Under my right palm she has drawn a small knife and written: for later. I fold the page back up and put it inside the book the woman on the plane was reading because I like the idea that two narratives I do not control will keep each other in line while I sleep.

When the orders come with a place that contains fewer vowels than I expected, the room goes quiet like a witness in church. The sergeant looks at me first and then at the paper because she has decided that names belong to faces before they belong to orders. She tells me to pack like I mean it and to expect the air to act differently than air acts when it is not mad at you. I sit on the bed that will belong to someone else tomorrow and I put the sugar packet Alyx gave me on my tongue like it is an answer key. It dissolves into a sweetness so ordinary I could weep, and I do not because ordinary is a kind of victory and you do not cry while the flag is watching. I write to my mother and do not mention buffalo or birds because sometimes the way you love someone is by leaving their best metaphor alone until it asks to be held.

Before I go, I take one long walk on the perimeter at night and listen to the fence tell the dark what it intends to do. The stars are arranged in a sentence I cannot parse, but it is my experience that if you stay still long enough, someone else will explain it to you with their hands. The field smells like the breath of a horse and I do not ask why because I like being surprised into trusting my own nose. Somewhere in the world my friends are in their rooms and on their roofs and under their rigs and between their sheets and on their buses, and we are all balancing on the rim of our private beginnings, and the trick is not to look for a net. The trick is to remember the ground is not a betrayal but a consequence. The trick is to make the door into a yes and the yes into a line and the line into a hand.Chapter 7 begins with a plane that decides to pretend it is a bus until the moment it takes offense at the ground. The C-17 is a room with straps instead of chairs, a room that smells like hydraulic breath and rubber, like the inside of a mouth that only ever eats wind. We sit knee to knee alongside pallets that are netted like promises and labeled with black marker that has learned how to be stern. The loadmasters move with the economy of men who have stood in too many moving rooms to believe in the drama of a stumble. Their hands speak cliches to the cargo and the cargo obeys, cradled in webbing that makes my fingers twitch with memory. I watch a bundle wrapped and crosshatched and my brain supplies the steps of a double star knot unasked, the same way it supplies the choreography of a fall any time a ceiling gets near. The plane hums us into togetherness that feels like cheating, then lurches up into an altitude that takes the names of our cities and puts them in a drawer until it needs them again.

We do not talk much because the noise likes to be the main character. Dove, who told me I could call her that because her real last name breaks in the middle, leans her helmet against the wall and sleeps in the way of people who refuse to admit exhaustion is anyone’s business. The sergeant whose authority fits her like a coat closes her eyes without letting her jaw relax. I think of Alyx in the loft and how she makes silence into a medium, not a consequence. I imagine my mother throwing plantains into hot oil and calling Lito useless and mean in the tone she uses when she is delighted by both. The knife charm bumps my thigh once and then settles like a cat that has chosen me on purpose. We rise. We ride. The world below turns from quilt to scab to reflected light and then the door opens not with a drama but with a shrug and we are poured into a place that forgot how to be soft.

The air on the tarmac hits the back of my throat and opens an umbrella inside it. Dust and heat and something industrial that has learned how to be personal shove their way in. The horizon here has no patience for trees. The base has the geometry of a place that expects to be forgiven for its looks because it is efficient: rows of tan boxes with doors, walls made of fabric that pretends to be stone, towers with heads like worried birds. We stand in a line and are counted, then counted again, then told where to put our bags and our attention. Generators grind their teeth for us and apologize by making shade. A sign tells us the name of the place and it is missing vowels in a way that refuses to be corrected by anyone who was not born here.

They send me to a tent for the new and the stubborn and hand me a plastic badge that thinks it’s important. Dove disappears into the masculine ballet of motor pools. The sergeant points at a building that looks like it is being held together by a rumor and says my name and the word “Rigging” with a crispness that makes both more real. I walk across ground that tries to remind me of flour and arrive at a warehouse built of steel that has been sweating for years. Inside, the air is a little cooler and the smell is a museum of fabric: canvas, nylon, sweat that left its salt behind like a note. Men and women in tan T-shirts and old opinions move between tables like their hands have memorized where to be and their mouths only occasionally need to report in. Above us, parachutes hang like jellyfish in a shallow ocean, willing to be touched but very clear about their dignity.

The chief rigger is a woman with hands that look like they were invented to find problems and yank them into better shapes. She looks at my paperwork and then at my shoulders and then at my face like she is checking to see if I was assembled with a manual or on a whim. “You’ve got jumps,” she says, not unkindly. “You’ve got hands. You have the look of someone who thinks knots are gossip. Don’t flirt with the G-12s. They’re older than you and vain.” She points me at a table with a partner whose name is Gordon but who calls himself Gordy because he has decided his life requires syllables to feel lived in. He talks while we pull silk that is not silk, nylon that thinks it is the sky’s understudy, and it is a comfort to have material under my palms that obeys pressure without getting offended.

We pack cargo parachutes that could bring down goats or generators or sacks of rice, depending on who is hungry that day. There is a checklist, the kind with boxes so small you have to behave to keep your pencil inside their edges, and the satisfying ritual of rubber bands and safety ties that appeal to the part of me that likes making a mess and then arranging it into art. We weigh bundles until the scale behaves. We tape until our fingerprints decide to leave the country. We stencil labels that have to survive insult and weather and the bad day of a plane. The younger riggers look at my knots like someone brought in a cousin from a different family reunion and we lose a few minutes to showing off and correcting each other until the chief rigger coughs meaningfully and we go back to being adults.

The first drop we support is for a village with a name I could never pronounce even if I dared to try, tucked into a bowl of land where roads change their minds after every rain. We are told the story the maps can’t carry: wells that argue with rocks, goats that mean everything, a school painted with handprints because paper is for secrets. My chest tightens with the dangerous pleasure of believing in help. We load the pallets with food and a tote of books that appeared like magic because the chaplain collects words the way some men collect knives, and a spool of cable requested by a man in a tent who fixes the radios that do not want to be fixed. The loadmaster pats each net with the same affection I have seen on the faces of midwives and then the plane swallows our work and leaves us to sweep in a silence that is mostly relief.

They send two of us up to push on the next drop and I am chosen because I haven’t learned how not to look eager and because I have the luck to be standing in the right square on the floor when the sergeant points at people and turns them into assignments. The plane’s interior is a familiar insult. The pallets here do not pretend to be calm. They vibrate with purpose, strapped tight to a floor they fully intend to leave. The loadmaster runs the briefing with the dry humor of a man who has seen many forms of gravity and believes he has negotiated with all of them. We talk about green lights and red lights and the personality facts of air over a particular valley at a particular hour. He shows me where to stand and where not to put my foot unless I want to be disciplined by physics. He hands me gloves that make my fingers feel like they are wearing costumes and I flex them against the idea of pushing a thousand pounds into absence and calling it kindness.

When the door opens, the light is a physical object that climbs inside my helmet and sits down. The wind is the fraternal twin of the one that has been muscling me since power-on, but at the door it remembers to say hello. The first pallet waits like an animal that has been told not to anticipate dinner lines. The light changes, we lose our red, the plane turns a shoulder to the invisible, the loadmaster grins like the joke finally found its setup, and we push. The pallet leaves us with a satisfaction I have only ever seen on the faces of objects that fulfill their design. For a second it swims, then it is gone, swallowed by a cartoon of distance that resolves into land and need. The third pallet tries to be dramatic, its corner catching on a lip of steel, and I am ready the way you are ready when you have spent a childhood throwing your weight at fabric until it decided to trust you. I lever, I lean, the loadmaster says something urgent that is both order and praise, and then the stubborn thing is out, falling toward people whose faces I can only imagine, toward a field that was swept clear of children and goats by men who know how to make a circle of safety without making the circle smaller than it has to be.

That night, sleep does not arrive like a stranger; it knocks and then goes around back and lets itself in. The tent hums with the quiet offensive of fans that never decided whether they are heroes. The cot behaves like a compromise. I write to Alyx until the pen insists my hand has already said enough but my mouth disagrees. I tell her about the pallets and the way the air over a valley behaves like a woman who has decided her dance is worth watching even if you came for something else. I tell her about the chief rigger’s hands, and how good it feels to be ranked by competence instead of charm, and how the parachutes draped from the rafters look like old gods taking a nap. I tell her the way my chest moves when the load leaves us and how that movement, small as it is, feels like a new ritual we invented together without needing to tell anyone in charge. I do not tell her that for an instant, when the third pallet caught, I felt the old terror flare in my ribs, the one that says, what if your hands are only decoration, what if their hungers and grammar are for theaters that don't look like this. I do not tell her because we have a contract about not inviting ghosts unless they bring wine.

Days here stack; they do not line up. The sun is indifferent, a god with an excellent attendance record and no interest in your birthdays. The rules multiply whenever anyone complains of boredom. The loudspeaker is in a long-distance relationship with a man who loves to say my last name wrong with authority. We work, we sweat, we argue about nothing, we save our arguments that matter for letters we do not send. In the evenings, the chaplain sometimes puts a guitar into the air and we sit on crates pretending our hands do not know what to do with quiet. A woman from another company walks a little course in the dusk, stepping over imaginary lines, and I learn that when she was little she had a coach who told her falling was a moral failure. We sit with that for a while and then we let it go like a parachute released from its bag and allowed to be what it has learned to be.

I become the person they send when a canopy drags a bundle toward the edge of a gully and kisses the idea of being a sail. There are days when the wind gets bored and invents itself new shapes. A dust devil performs for us out on the DZ, coy at first and then confident, and a parachute decides it wants to be a boat. You think you are learning about gravity and then the air reminds you it wants equal billing. We chase, we catch lines because we are taught to catch, not to be heroic. I carry the hook knife in the pouch where everyone is supposed to carry it and I tell my palm to love it like it loves the tiny charm, and when the line snaps across my wrist with that bright intention a rope has when it meets skin, I remember Abby teaching me to pretend to be bored when danger wants your attention. I wait, I step, I cut, I try not to give the wind a show. The canopy collapses without style and the bundle sulks and I laugh because sulking objects are always funny until they aren’t, and this time the joke costs no one blood.

Alyx sends a package and it arrives looking like it has been given three chances to escape and chose dignity instead. Inside are socks that have opinions about comfort, a drawing of the cranes wearing tiny helmets like they are at last in on the joke and have decided they want to be airborne too, a handful of paper cranes folded from old playbills, and a note in which she admits to setting an alarm for a time she believes I will be in line and then standing at the kitchen sink and thinking a nice thought at the same minute, as if niceness, concentrated, could hop borders. She includes a scrap of red silk cut from an old rehearsal fabric, not enough to rig a thing, just enough to thumb. I sit on my cot and touch that silk like it contains instructions, and when I sleep that night I dream I am under it again and I am also under a canopy and the two fabrics do not fight. They behave like cousins who came to the reunion prepared to compliment each other’s choices and hold up the table where the food is heavy.

There is a day that starts wrong because the radio wakes us and the man on the other end says the thing in the tone that means it is not a drill. The quickness that lives in our bones stands up. We pull on what protects us, which is to say we pull on our work. The generator throws in a tantrum because it cannot not. The siren makes its bargain with the air and the air agrees to carry it. We move into places the commanding voice always wants us to want, and a sound arrives from above that is not our sound. It reaches into my chest and adjusts my breath without asking permission. Nothing happens, which is to say something happens somewhere else, which is worse in a way that makes time a slinky. Later we hear about a mortar that had a different argument with the sky and chose to resolve it in a corner of the field where nothing but a rumor of goats lives. We say thank you out loud to physics, which does not need our thanks, and go back to work with the particular focus of people who know that work is a spell.

I am sitting on a crate watching two riggers argue about the superior moral character of particular tape brands when the unit’s liaison with helicopter world appears like a man who has been sent back to tell us there is a new idea. He is shaped like someone who used to carry too many heavy things in a frame that was breaking up the band and decided to stop doing that in favor of carrying the kinds of burdens that hide in briefcases. He asks for a volunteer who can tie a bowline behind her back, and Gordy points at me with all of his fingers at once as if he is conducting an orchestra made of my qualifications. This is how I end up in the fat stomach of a helicopter that smells like dust and pride, hands already sticky with the film that low hot air puts on skin, rigging a sling to a pallet that contains boxes of things that will turn into medicine in the right hands. The crew chief does not smile for the first ten minutes and then he does and it is the kind of beam that has been earned by watching people like me do their jobs without making extra work for him.

We lift. The belly clutches the cargo like a mother in a painting and then the rotor beats start moving us out. From up here the base is a pattern my hands could trace without a pencil. The walls make sense. The places we are not supposed to put our feet make sense. The land beyond the wire is a different sentence, longer and more honest, full of clauses that include the words “if” and “then” and “not this time.” I am strapped in the place where they have decided a body like mine can be trusted to stand but not to fall out. The sling does its job because my hands did theirs and because the people who cut and stitched the webbing were paid and proud. We lower at the place on the map that looks like a coin stuck into the mouth of a canyon, and the doctor and two men in t-shirts and sandals whose faces do not believe in cameras wave thank you in that efficient way that says we all have heat to wrestle. We do not land. We hover and talk with our hands, then the sling empties and our stomach lightens and the helicopter is a creature with one less worry. On the way back the crew chief offers me a piece of gum that tastes like childhood and gasoline, and I take it because some offerings are not complicated.

I write to my mother that night because if I don’t tell her about the helicopter now, she will find a way to be in the kitchen when I am sixty and ask why I saved the part where the air held my job for last. She writes back with a drawing of a buffalo in a helicopter that looks like a loaf of bread with manners and an assertion that birds and buffalo both have to agree to ride machines if the machines insist. She says Lito is teaching the kid down the hall to fix his bicycle and the kid’s mother cried on the stairs because the father has been in a country she refuses to name for three years and the bicycle will get the child to a little job that will put money in the freezer, and my mother cannot pretend the small is not large because she did not raise herself that way.

A week later a message comes with my name on it in the moth-eaten font of officialdom and I go to a room with a hum and a table that pretends to be wood. The sergeant sits with her shoulders already telling me this is a talk about trust. The orders have grown numbers. The numbers have acquired teeth. She says a unit with a lineage our drill sergeant once sang at us over push-ups is asking for my hands and four others for a rotation that believes in stairs made of air. It is not a big change and it is not a small one. She tells me she does not want to lose me because when you ask the canopy to be good, you also want the hands that folded it to believe in what they are doing, and then she vacates her face for a second to let the human in say, “You will be fine unless you are not. I am not a poet. Do not make me be one.”

I walk out with the paper feeling like a door in my pocket and stand in the yard where the shipping containers make a boulevard because someone stacked them with personality. The heat takes my hair, such as it is, and runs its palm over it possessively. I take the tiny knife charm out and press the notch into the soft pad below my thumb, a sweetness I have rehearsed. I think of Alyx cutting a drawing with delicacy, of the time she saved a fish from pretending plastic had a taste it deserved. I think of a room with red fabric and a man who insisted politics must check their shoes at the door. I think of Rizzo somewhere else in this same sky making a joke about a bird learning to be a storm window. I think of the first drop I pushed and how the absence where the pallet was became a kind of object I could carry around until it set.

The night before I go, I climb the makeshift pull-up bar some genius welded to two posts with a weld that looks like someone taught a vine to become metal. A soldier from a place where vowels are cheap spots me with his hands fanned like a magician refusing to admit he has cards. We exchange names without trying very hard to say them right because there is no future in insulting a vowel without practicing first. He asks me what it feels like to be small and expected to catch heavy things and I say heavy things want to be caught more often than they will ever tell you. He laughs without liking it and then shows me a picture of a cat whose face looks like it has been insulted by evolution in a very personal way. When I drop, my shoulders behave and my mind agrees to let me sleep.

We leave at a time of day that claims to exist only to keep schedules honest. The new unit is all corners and songs. Their insignia looks silly until you wear it for long enough to stop noticing and then you catch a glimpse of yourself in a window and you feel like an illustration that forgot to be in color. The sergeant there is a man whose voice has been taught by distances to be precise. He tells me what he wants from my hands and my feet and my selections of language. He says we are going to be closing a circle of air by jumping at a time of day when sensible people are putting on water for tea. He says if I have a problem I should have it quietly and then at volume to him, in that order. He stops, looks at me, and adds, “If you smile, I will know where you learned it,” which makes me feel both seen and in debt.

We rehearse in a hangar that could keep its secrets better if it tried. The plane is not ours until it is, and then it is ours and we speak to it like a pet that hasn’t been neutered. Texas would have loved the theatre of this room; I imagine his knees tapping out their bilingual uncertainty and have to tuck my smile under the nearest strap. The plan is a woven basket we carry in our heads: who takes what door, which count we bless, where the wind last wrote its name. The door is still a mouth. It is always a mouth. When we go, we go with the selfish goodness of people who believe our small bodies can braid themselves with a purpose big enough to be respectable. We stand; we hook up; we sound off like a prayer. We go.

The night jump takes the color out of everything but intention. The wind is colder when it is not being watched. The light is less personal; green feels measured, red feels like a neighbor. The noise continues with a stubbornness that borders on reassurance. When I step, the air takes my shins first like it is negotiating a payment plan. The count writes itself down my bones in numbers too round to be anything but honest. The canopy opens like a book whose story you know and love and have somehow forgotten the best part of until it finds you. The world below is not a map. It is a set of feelings carpeting the ground: fear, stubbornness, necessity, boredom, endurance. I steer with the respect of someone who knows ropes and people equally dislike being yanked. The ground rises into a shape that is less obnoxious in the dark. I kiss it with the bored part of my body we were taught to love. I roll. I come up with dust in my mouth that tastes like someone’s old arguments and I say fine, you can live here.

After, when the helmets are off and the straps are released and the stories begin nibbling at the edges of our mouths, a young soldier with an accent that has decided to stay asks me if I always loved falling or if I learned to. I say wanting is a habit, like anything else worth learning past your dignity. He nods like I have sold him something he can use and wanders away to pretend there is no such thing as trembling hands. I find a corner of the hangar that is pretending to be quiet and touch the tiny knife charm through my pocket and imagine Alyx’s fingers on the flat of my back drawing a line across an atlas, deciding where I begin and where I continue. The sergeant catches my eye and taps his own shoulder and I realize only then that the new badge, a silly little piece of metal shaped like permission, has been pinned there while I was thinking of metaphors. It hurts the way it is meant to hurt and I laugh but I keep it.

Later that night, a sandstorm blows in like someone took a broom to the sky and lost their temper. The base becomes a single color. The air inside the tent tries to audition for the role of outside. We seal what can be sealed and curse what cannot, and then the storm is the only thing to talk about and so we stop talking about it because we are cheap with our conversational currency. I lie on my cot and listen to the sand worry at the fabric like thought, at first relentless and then replaced by its own boredom. The little knife charm is under my tongue and tastes like metal and Alyx, which is to say it tastes like a promise you give yourself in a doorway with the lights off. I think of the cranes at home and how the gulls sometimes rest on their crossbars like punctuation, small and sure, and I hope the lights on the islands are still pretending to be a future we could believe in if someone wrote it down neatly. In the morning, the sand will be everywhere it wasn't invited and we will pretend we need it, because there is a trick to belonging and one of the tricks is admitting you would have missed the thing that irritated you if it had traveled on.

The call to roll out comes at a time that would be obscene anywhere with winter, and we shoulder packs that insist on our personal involvement. The next place is close on the map and far with our feet. We go because going is what holds the day together. The truck’s benches claim our bones and the road performs under us like a drum too clever to take requests. Dove leans her head back and tells me she dreamed she could open a parachute over the ocean and walk across it like a miracle that isn’t interested in making an argument. I tell her that when the chute fills at dusk, the sound it makes is the same as a sentence my grandmother used to say when she had decided to forgive someone and wanted to make sure everybody knew. She snorts softly and says she doesn’t like forgiveness unless it shows its work, and I laugh because math jokes are my kink when the weather cooperates.

We cross a stretch of land so flat it tastes like a dare. There are men in a field holding shovels and talking with their whole shoulders. There are women washing something out of something in a pan that shines angrily against the eye. There are children who stare until they are full and then become bored like children anywhere, and one throws a rock at nothing in particular and hits it. The wind tries out our names and decides it does not need any of them. We arrive at a place where the ground is pocked with old intentions and the walls are built of the materials that admit to being temporary. The point of our bodies here is to be points in a geometry someone else is drawing, but I still feel like art. My hands any time they are asked to listen turn into something like faith and that has to be worth at least a joke.

That night, in a modular room that could be a church if someone asked it kindly, we sit with a dozen faces whose names I will not put in my notebook because some names are shy when handled by strangers. The interpreter makes the words behave and we make our breaths behave and the air misbehaves and we all deal with it with the courtesy of decent families. A man speaks about water like it is a person they have wronged and are asking back to the table. A woman speaks about light like it has become untrustworthy and we should tell it jokes until it remembers itself. I say little because I have learned a theatrical truth that applies everywhere: if it is not your scene, do not steal it. Later, one of the boys points at a patch on my sleeve and then at my mouth and then at the sky and laughs because in some languages that is a joke about how people who love the air never shut up. I make my face into a thing that can take a joke without changing shapes, which is a trick called adulthood.

If there is a climax to this chapter, it is not the thing with the truck or the time the rope snapped or the moment the helicopter’s stomach went light. It is a smaller trespass. It is me alone in the rigging bay after hours when the fans have decided buzzing is a way of life and the lights have made a contract with the moths. It is me pulling a length of webbing from the bin and turning it into something like a silk, rigging it from a beam that would be offended if it knew I was calling to it and saying, remember? It is me climbing just high enough that my ribs get a different idea and letting my body drop into a wrap that knows my language and trusts my knees. It is me hanging there, a handful of feet above a concrete floor that has conducted petty crusades against softer things, and telling my muscles to report in, one by one, like kids lined up alphabetically for a field trip. It is me breathing and not being made to apologize for how loud it is. It is me thinking of Alyx’s drawing and the planes of me that she named and realizing I have learned some new ones since, angles that do not belong to either of us but will still fit on the page if we make room. It is me letting go a little and being caught by something I recognized before I could spell it. It is me climbing down, slower than pride would like, and running my hand over the webbing until it makes that small dry whisper and saying out loud, for no one at all, thank you.Chapter 9 begins with a morning that refuses to warm up, a gray that looks imported, the kind that makes metal think about rust and lungs think about bargaining. The base is hungover from a wind that chewed at everything that would not chase it, and the rigging bay has a dust line around the door like a tide mark made of the broken parts of a desert. The chief rigger arrives with her coffee in the way of a person who believes in caffeinated nouns and looks at the schedule like it has injured her feelings. We have three loads for three coordinates that are only coordinates if you squint; otherwise they are promises we have to keep with rope. Gordy hums a song beneath his breath that he swears isn’t a song, just a noise his family makes when they are trying not to curse at a stubborn jar. I take the inventory board and read what we are about to commit to gravity and find the column that lists “ humanitarian” in small letters that are pretending to be humble so we won’t interrogate them. The bay smells like nylon and decisions, and my hands twitch with the knowledge of their own usefulness, which is a favorite vice.

The first pallet is all rice that will be bored until it isn’t, plastic sacks that urge your shoulders to remember their manners and your fingers to trust the way a knot becomes a sentence. We build the stack like a church, four corners honest as kneecaps, cross-braced with intention, then we pull the net over like we are covering a child who refuses to admit sleep exists. The second pallet is water and a crate of filters that hiss in their plastic as if they already want to be in rivers. The last pallet is smaller but trickier, because small is often where trick lives; boxes of medical supplies with labels that claim allegiance to languages I haven’t been polite enough to learn, and a bundle of laminated picture cards the chaplain insisted on sneaking in because he thinks the universal syntax of “point to where it hurts” is a kindness worth betting on. We weigh and check and circle and initial in boxes that look smaller every day, then the loadmaster breezes through and does that thing with his eyebrows that says, yes, but also I am paid to ask.

After the plane takes our work the bay has that emptiness that can go either way, grief or possibility. I sweep sawdust that isn’t sawdust and watch the door, which is a habit the army has successfully grafted onto my nervous system. Dove leans against the far table, her boots leaving compliant prints on floor dust, and tells me about a letter she got from home that wasn’t from home at all, from a woman she called her aunt as a child and her neighbor as an adult, a woman who wears scarves not because she’s cold but because she’s done arguing with hair. The letter said the dog died and then told a story about the time the dog brought home a child who had wandered away from the park and would not be convinced the dog had not given birth to him, and the story made Dove laugh the kind of laugh you only get when you have kept a life going besides your own. We trade pictures of animals whose faces don’t forgive evolution until the siren on the load ramp tells us the plane is back, fat in the belly and ready for more.

When the message comes down about the valley wind shifting, it arrives as a sentence without verbs. The loadmaster says something about rotor wash and a crossbreeze that has developed an ego, and the chief rigger says something about staying on the safe side of paranoia, and my own spine does the old circus thing where it chooses to notice balance before emotion. We build for fussy air, which means more ties and fewer assumptions, and we tuck every loose end into a stricter geometry than any theater ever demanded. I kiss the tape like a superstitious teenager and the tape pretends not to mind. When we send the third load, the one with the filters and the cards and the sharp things borrowed from the future, Dove touches the net and says “good girl” under her breath because she is a person who believes gender is a joke and also a spell.

In the afternoon I am given the gift of boredom, the hour you can live inside your own head without asking anyone to bless it. I sit on a crate and clean the hook knife in the way I’ve learned is necessary when dust refuses to respect your tools. The blade catches light in a sullen way and my fingers remember every theater where this motion was part of warm-up, every field where it is part of staying allowed to come back tomorrow. A boy who can’t grow a beard no matter how he bullies his face into patience comes in with a strap he has killed with kindness and his teeth catch on “Sergeant,” as if the word has splinters. I help him salvage what can be salvaged and he tells me he comes from a place with a river that pretends to be small until it gets to town, a river that doesn’t believe in your plans. He says when he left, his grandmother taught him how to wedge a folded dollar in the kitchen door to keep it from sticking and told him that if the dollar went missing, the house had chosen him. He hasn’t been home to check and he says that not checking is its own kind of religion. I tell him about plantains and hurricanes and cranes and he nods because even if you’ve never seen a crane, you know a tall thing that pretends to be gentle.

The night the pallets did not behave, the world had the decency to alert us before it did anything rude. The plane left like it was ashamed of its own voice and we sat in the bay with the radio performing its duty as a suspicious friend. The call came and it was a sound not a word—wind, distance, apology. We learned later that the second pallet twisted at the lip like a man reconsidering a proposal, and by the time the loadmaster coaxed it, the wind had written its name in a place it hadn’t right to be. The bundle went into a small grove of trees that looked impressed with themselves and then less impressed because nylon can be a bully if offered leverage. No one was standing under it, which is to say everyone was standing under it somewhere else, and the prayers the chaplain never admits he says probably did their small job. We did not sleep much because it felt like cheating on something to sleep with a pallet in a tree.

Morning finds us in a helicopter that needs to be bribed with faith and fuel, the sling gear unfurled like an old story across the deck. The pilot is the same immovable shape from last time and the crew chief chews gum like he’s trying to keep it from enlisting. The grove is smaller from the air than it had any right to be. The bundle hangs by its net like a bad idea that forgot how to articulate itself and the canopy is draped over a branch so politely it would be impolite to mention it. We hover until the world in the side window is a thumbprint of dust and the machine drools air down onto the grove with the intimacy of a confession. I clip the long line with the attention of a librarian returning a book that changed her, and the crew chief leans out in a posture that would embarrass a mother. We bag the canopy first, a slow wrestling match with a creature that is trying to play dead, and then we lower the hook to take the weight of failure so we can call it success. It goes, finally, because everything goes in the end, and the pilot lifts a breath’s worth all at once and the treetop has a private meeting with the idea of loneliness.

We set down near a field where a dozen children have been told not to be and are, their feet already where dust returns itself to dust. The interpreter who has been assigned to us for the week arrives with cheeks that look like he is very good at smiling on purpose and tells us the words people said last night when they saw a parachute in a tree. The men said it was a sign and the women said it was a sign and nobody agreed on the adjective. An old woman slapped the trunk and spat respectfully, which is two different gestures in her language, and then hit two men who were trying to climb in a way that would make the tree forgive them. The children decided the parachute was a tent for a giant and named the giant after whoever told the first story. We stand under the branch while our hands do the math of tension, and I wonder if there is a version of me who would choose grove maintenance as work, the kind of peace that is also skill. The load is free, finally, and it hangs under us like a surrender flag that learned better manners, and when we fly it back to the base, the pilot comments, which is rare enough that we all listen, “That tree wasn’t planning on making sacrifices this month.” The crew chief says without thinking, “Neither were we,” and I put the joke in my pocket because I don’t know if it will later want to be a poem.

That week, mail arrives like a small, stubborn holiday. Alyx’s envelope is taped within an inch of its life and covered in stamps that look like they were chosen by a child who likes birds wearing hats. Inside I find a photograph of the drawing she’s been working on, except it is no longer a drawing and not exactly a print; she has made it on fabric, silk screened on a strip of old rigging I left behind, the planes of me now an object with edges that fray without apology. She writes that the show went well in the way we mean when we say “went well,” which is to say nobody threw a drink and someone asked what the work wanted and then actually listened. Oakes cried at a dignified volume behind a lighting tower and then announced a residency for himself that everyone ignored. My mother brought plantains to the gallery and made the curator check the fire codes for how many frying pans are allowed in a room with a thousand dollars of insurance, then ate half of them on the sidewalk with the neighbor’s boy who had a cast and a story. Alyx added a postscript with scissors drawn in blue ink marching toward a knot and wrote, “I still have the knot. I am going to cut it when you tell me you didn’t need it,” and I cry in a way that doesn’t cost me water, just patience.

There is a day the unit borrows me and my hook knife to do a job that is not officially my job but is the job of hands in a place where hands are not abundant. We go out after sunrise and return before reason, walking a line of wire that wants to teach your ankles new profanity. The objective is to redirect a river that thinks it knows better than the engineers, which is a sentence that always makes someone upset. We are given stakes and string and the admonition to remember mosquitoes also have mothers. There is a moment where all of us are standing in a shallow where the water is arguing down our knees and it feels like church, not my mother’s church where the saints are noisy, but the older church where everyone is a rock. I think about how many times my job has been to persuade a thing to move and how often the thing has been me, and I wonder if I am a good person or just a useful one. Dove teaches me a song in her language that is not her language anymore, a kids’ song about a goat with opinions, and I echo the parts that my mouth can manage. The sergeant stops us when we are laughing and points to a ridge where a boy has been standing and watching, and the whole team slips a measure toward silence because both laughter and boys are hunting calls if you use them wrong.

At chow that night I sit with a squad who likes their jokes mean and their rice sweet and they include me the way men include each other when they know they are being good because a woman is watching. One of them tells the story of how he fell asleep in a ditch early in his last tour and woke up with frogs composing an orchestra around his boots, and how for a second he forgot what his job was and thought maybe music was going to save him without having to do a thing. I tell them about the time Alyx and I did a theater piece in a warehouse with a leaky roof and how the drip found the center of the stage and how we built the show around it, how the audience thought we were brilliant and we were just out of buckets. The mood goes slippery when someone says a name and everyone else goes quiet, and I remember how quickly men will make a wall around grief so the women do not have to take off their shoes to enter. We talk about gear then, about weights and harness bite and which brand of sock holds a grudge. It saves all of us from a kind of tenderness we don’t have time for until later, when the tent is darker.

Two weeks later we lose a pallet to thieves with better timing than ours. It drops where it is supposed to and then it drops into someone’s idea of ownership, and by the time anyone with a badge arrives, the rice has been redistributed by a council of adults and eight children who used to be three children. The official reaction is the official reaction. The unofficial is a quiet conversation in the rigging bay where the chief rigger sits on the floor because sitting in chairs has begun to feel like a power move and she isn’t interested. She says air is public and earth is private and the trick is to walk the line and come home with the same feet. Dove says she learned something about property from a neighbor with a lemon tree over a chain-link fence: if it falls on your side you get to keep it, but you have to bake something with it for the person who did the growing. I decide that if anyone asked me to deliver a pie by parachute I would tell them yes. We file a report that will not be read and mend a net that will be used again, and I go to my cot and do not write Alyx about this because I am trying not to teach her to look for theft where kindness might be hiding.

When it rains, the base smells like cold metal remembering how to be nice. Everyone walks faster because rain simply isn’t in the contract here and no one brought their legal team. The rigging bay leaks from a seam over the second table, a polite drip that chooses the same place each time like a disciplined dancer hitting a mark. I move the pallet to make room for the mouth of a bucket and then stand with my hand under the drip as if I can memorize the temperature of this surprise. The chaplain sticks his head in like a cat you didn’t adopt and tells us a rumor about a USO show we will pretend we do not want to attend, and I learn that you can be many things and still be a person who craves a tired joke told into a microphone. I go anyway, of course I go, and the woman who sings forgets a verse and laughs and we love her the way you love anyone who agrees to be foolish for you on purpose. A man juggles knives that are not knives, big aluminum things dressed as threats, and my palms sweat because I have always taken it personally when objects pretend to be more dangerous than they are. I return to the bay feeling soothed in the way you feel soothed when the noise belonged to someone else and it is not your job to sort it.

The letter from Rizzo arrives with a crease where a pocket made a decision. She writes from a place where the ocean is a rumor the air tells when it wants to brag. She says the sand is a different personality there, less clingy, more like a guest who cleans up after itself and then complains about the soap. She has learned to love the way dust lies down at night when the heat lets go, and she hates the part of the morning where everything is damp even when there has been no rain. She talks about a jump where the air had an argument with itself and she had to teach her canopy to behave, and in the postscript she writes that she saw a bird ride a thermal like a girl who has decided to stop pretending she can’t do the math. She asks me not to say anything to anyone about the lumps in her right ankle, and I write back that I will keep her secrets until they stop being secrets and become history. Then I add, selfishly, that if the lump is actually a small god, she should ask it for a favor on my behalf.

The first malfunction does not belong to me, which is how I learn I won’t be the center of every story even when the story lands in my lap. We are on a training jump for people whose names consist entirely of letters, and at jump run you can taste the math the pilot is doing in his teeth. Third out from my door, a canopy opens into a question mark, two line twists that could be a party trick or a half-written letter. The jumper kicks and follows the steps the way we were taught to do anything before we learned to make it art. She turns, she breathes, she chooses the spine of her fear and plucks it like a string, and then it sorts itself into a wing we would invite to dinner. My feet are on the ground by the time she makes it down, my count faithful and intrusive as ever, and when she looks at me she laughs without meaning to because my face is saying, yes yes yes, and also, we could have died, and also, I love you, and also, did you see that bird. Later we tag lines and clean up the drop zone as if tidiness is an offering, and she walks beside me and tells me her mother sent her a cake in a jar and she ate the entire jar with a spoon, slowly, like a person practicing mercy.

Trouble that wears boots arrives on a Tuesday that pretends it is a Friday. The first round lands so far from where we are that it takes us a moment to give our bodies permission to listen. The siren does what it is paid to do and we do what we were trained to, which is create a geometry of safety out of hallways and desire. The second round is braver and the third is sentimental and found someone’s empty bench and turned it into splinters. I count because counting is how I feel like a person who can be trusted, and then I stop because counting is sometimes how you keep yourself from hearing the important thing. Gordy goes pale in a way that suggests he is cataloguing exit strategies and then apologizes out loud as if the air is the host and he forgot to RSVP properly. The fourth round hits a wall that has been bored for months and the wall groans with actual relief because something finally made its day feel interesting. When the all-clear wanders into the bay wearing its important voice, we hesitate, the whole bay a dog who isn’t sure whether the fireworks are over. Later, when we are lined up to have our names checked against a list, the chief rigger touches each of us like we are blessed bread and mutters our names in the way of a person who doesn’t trust other people to keep track.

I write to my mother that night because my mouth needs something true in it. I do not tell her about the rounds because she will throw a slipper at God and I do not want to be responsible for that kind of ruckus. I tell her about the rain and the cake in a jar and the way the helicopters look like angry insects from the wrong angle. She writes back with a recipe that is also a sermon, measuring forgiveness in cups and fear in teaspoons, and advises me to boil the water before trusting it even when it swears it is clean. She says the neighbor’s boy with the cast took off running after a bus last week and she shouted after him like a chorus and found herself crying for nothing, which is to say for everything, which is to say for me. She draws another crane and it is perfect in the way only something that knows it will never be is perfect.

The invitation to Jumpmaster School arrives folded into a joke. The sergeant sets it on the table and asks if I have any plans to become more of a problem. The paper says I have been noticed by people who notice things, that my exits are clean and my counts are reliable and my face doesn’t flinch when younger people make decisions that would benefit from wisdom they haven’t had time to acquire. It says if I say yes now I will spend a month being turned into a person who will be paid to tell the air whom to eat and whom to excuse. It says if I say no now no one will ask me again for another year because the air hates to beg. I carry the paper around like it is money and I am trying to decide if buying shoes is spiritual. In the night I dream that Oakes is standing at the door of a plane pouting because he doesn’t have the right hat, and Alyx is there balancing a coffee cup on her knee and saying, “Count, love,” in a voice that makes me flinch without taking offense. In the morning I say yes because yes is a habit when I am trying to remember which shape belongs to me.

The school is an hour away and a thousand feet higher, and the buildings there have the personality of healthy teeth. The instructors wear their reputations like borrowed suits and then take them off and become sly and funny and mean in ways that help. They do the thing that good teachers do, which is take the art you love and make it into labor until you return to the art with your back complaining and your heart grateful. We learn to stare at doors as if they are criminals. We learn to count until counting gets bored and creates shortcuts. We learn to say “stand by” without flinching when the person who needs to hear it is shaking in a way they have been pretending to hide with jokes. We learn to look at a line of static and see the way a bird sees wind, not as a mystery but as a field with fences and gates and occasional annoyed cows. At night I take notes that will not make sense to anyone in six months, and I rub my thumb over the knife charm until it heats against my skin and becomes personable.

Halfway through, a letter finds me with Alyx’s handwriting braver than it was when we were fifteen. She has drawn diagrams of the loft with measurements that are not accurate but are committed, and marked the spots where the light behaves itself and where it doesn’t and where we always land the first throw like we invented fate. She writes about a girl in the class she teaches on Saturdays who can already tie a decent French knot and has decided to become an example of something nobody has told her about yet. She writes the word mine and then strikes it out and writes ours and then strikes that out and writes yours and then underlines the word room three times and reminds me the world is big enough to abhor ownership. She says the cranes looked bored last week and she threw a stone into the water to see if it would make them look and it did not and she forgave them on the spot and went home and drew a window that never existed and put it above our bed and believes she dreamed warmer. I carry the letter under my shirt during a day of door drills like a teenager hiding sin in a textbook and my exits are criminally good and no one but me knows why.

On the day we jump as Jumpmasters for the first time, my bones feel like they wore their good clothes. The air is the same air and the plane is the same plane and yet everything is in another key and the song is clean. The soldiers in the chairs look like a deck of cards that has agreed to be dealt to. I move down the line and check equipment with the indifference you must learn to wear, not arrogance but a kind of borrowed authority that suggests you know what will save someone and will not explain until you need to. The first jumper is a kid who looks like he should be standing on a cafeteria line asking if there is extra rice and he calls me “ma’am” in a tone his mother would recognize. The last jumper is a woman with two kids and a haircut she chose with intention and she romances the static line with her fingertips like a person grateful for an old reliable lover. I say the words. I say them like a door opening and like a door closing and like a window in summer. When the green light hits, I feel something in my chest that is not mine but was entrusted to me for sixty seconds and for exactly sixty seconds I am clean and responsible and enough.

After, when the steps are checked and the logs are signed and we have scolded the kid who tried to bring his nervous joke into the wrong part of the plane, I find a corner of the hangar and breathe like a person learning the instrument she is made out of. The sergeant who sent my name looks at me like you look at a solution that finally agreed to be found and says nothing because sometimes praise is a way of spending a person’s energy for them. I write to my mother and tell her that directing people into the sky feels like cooking with other people’s hunger, that it is a joy that pretends not to be joy because joy and power look bad together if photographed. She writes back that she will beat me with a spoon if I forget to feed myself first, and draws a bird riding a buffalo’s back like a small king who knows it cannot ride forever. I hide her drawing in the cover of the notebook where I write numbers and try to keep them from turning into poems.

We return to the rigging bay and it feels like confession. The nets have their own domestic odor, slightly damp dignity, the rubber bands begrudge us with a snap that makes everyone cuss in the same language. I am quieter and the chief rigger sniffs me like a dog of rank and lets me be. Dove shows me a scar I had not seen, the kind under the cuff where a watch would be if her life allowed watches, and tells me she got it on a night jump in a state with too much sky. She asks me what I will do when I am done being useful and I tell her a lie first because I am trying it out, and then I tell her I want to make a thing so useful the world mistakes it for art. We fold a canopy the way you fold a problem you have finally learned to live with instead of solve.

On a day that is all glare we lose a line of chalk on the drop zone boundary because the wind refuses to be the straight man in anyone’s joke. The DZ safety wanders in circles like a man hunting his dignity and I am given a marking panel the size of a small window and told to pretend I am a flag. The heat climbs my spine; the light plays tricks that would work in any theater. Out beyond, toward the ridge we decide is a horizon only because everyone says so, a shepherd tends animals that might be goats and might be something more poetic that I have no word for. He watches us for a while and then does not, and I envy his ability to let spectacle move through him unmoved. When the jump is over, he walks toward me with the measured courtesy of someone approaching a neighbor he doesn’t know if he likes. He points to the sky and then to my chest and says something the interpreter translates as, “You call that bird.” I say, “Sometimes it calls me,” and the interpreter frowns because her religion does not include metaphor. The shepherd watches the metal bird leave and then nods like we have both done our jobs to everyone’s satisfaction.

The worst thing that happens does not happen to me, which is why it is so hard to talk about in a story I’m making from my mouth. It happens at the edge of the unit’s mission, where the part with our names on it meets the part with no names, and it happens in such a way that when they come to tell us, the telling falls apart halfway through the sentence. We line up our dread in order of rank and it doesn’t matter. We sit on crates because chairs feel like thieves. Someone starts to make coffee that nobody drinks. The chaplain puts his hands in his pockets and takes them out and puts them in his pockets and takes them out and then remembers to look like he believes in something specific. Later there will be paperwork and the hollow ceremony that insists on itself like a legal holiday. Later there will be photos in frames and four hands that do laundry every week with the knowledge a boy’s socks will not come home. Now there is the rigging bay with a net draped like a veil, and Gordy’s knuckles, and Dove’s jaw, and the chief rigger calling roll in a voice that would rather be breaking. I write nothing that night because the words under my pen want to be a complaint and I am trying to be gentle with the people who think they don’t believe in poems.

The day after a death we fly more than we planned, which is the military’s way of saying yes to the only bargaining chip it has. We load the pallets like communion, and the loadmaster makes a joke about weight tapes that nobody laughs at and which saves all of us anyway. On the flight, the cargo shakes like a horse you are reminding of your weight, and the pilot is precise in ways that make the plane feel unashamed of its physics. The drop is good. The air doesn’t play around. The ground does what it always does. On the ramp, the crew chief slaps my shoulder without looking at me and his palm leaves a heat that becomes a kind of blessing until we’re back and the chief rigger looks at me and says, “Don’t you dare try to make this holy,” and I say, “I won’t,” and we both know I will.

That evening, the sky remembers how to offer purple without committing to sentimentality. The base is quiet in the way kitchens are quiet after the guests leave and before the family allows itself to be tired. I take my strip of silk from Alyx’s package out to the berm at the edge of the world we’re allowed to have, and tie it to the chain-link like a prayer I’m willing to let the wind see. It snaps and flutters and then lies with the fence like a secret meeting that ended without a plan. I talk aloud because people here pretend not to notice when other people talk to nothing. I tell the air about the show on the roof, about the girl with the French knots, about my mother’s spoon and her threats and her love which is a hurricane with a grocery list. I tell the fence about the boy who liked frogs and the man with the lemon tree and the shepherd who nodded at my job like he wanted to borrow it. I tell the strip of silk that when I come home I will hang it in the window like a tongue and wait for the cranes to decide if they approve. Then I go back to the bay and we pack three more parachutes because this is what makes the days line up instead of fall apart.

When we jump at dawn for the last time that month, the light is so new it forgets what colors are for and just gives us honesty. The load is our bodies and the wind is a negotiator who didn’t get enough sleep. I stand in the door with my new voice and make my throat do its job, which is to be undeniable. The first three go like coins into a machine that does not cheat. The fourth hesitates the way a foot does when a brain has been loyal to ground for too long, and I lean in with a hand that is not a push but a fact. Out he goes, and I want to kiss the air for being such a menace and such a partner. My own exit is somewhere in the middle, lost under the paperwork of everyone else’s, and when my canopy opens it is the sentence my grandmother forgave me with, the long consonant I didn’t know would make me softer. The drop zone is a mouth again and I land in it like a word it knows how to say. Up on the berm, the strip of red defies the fence by remembering how to look like a river. I pack my parachute with my hands and my knees and my small, ordinary faith, and try not to memorize the moment so hard that I cannot bear to live any other ones.

On leave, if you can call a weekend that takes place three tents away leave, I help Dove hang a sheet for a movie with so many versions that describing it would be a betrayal. The projector wheezes and does the holy work anyway, and the men who swore not to cry are safe because the film is in black and white and nobody admits to feeling when the palette is unreasonable. We sit on the ground and share oranges that taste like home if your home is a place that makes you work for it, and we talk in the way of people who have decided to treat this not as an interlude but as a room. Dove says when she gets out she is going to build a library in the back of a truck and only go to towns that claim they don’t read. I tell her I am going to make a stage on the pier where the wind cannot throw its voice without telling us first. We agree to believe each other until proven otherwise, and I tuck those plans into the same pocket as the charm and the letter and the folded drawing and let them keep each other company. Somewhere, Rizzo calls me “Bird” under her breath and I answer “Buffalo” like a password we invented in a dream and made real because if you say anything often enough in this world, the world will eventually pretend it thought of it first.

When the next set of orders come, they are not a surprise so much as a door I’ve been listening to for an hour and that finally opens. We’re going to a place with hills like shoulders and a sky that insists on telling us secrets in a language we don’t have time for. The sergeant points at the map and uses his thumb, which means there is urgency and also an attempt at comfort. The chaplain circles the tent with his guitar and does not intrude, which is a skill he had to learn and we had to let him. The chief rigger tosses me the clipboard with the confidence of a person who would let me hold her child if she had a child, and Dove tells me a joke that is not very good and saves me from myself anyway. I fold the strip of silk into my pocket because it has been outside long enough to acquire its own weather, and the knife charm clicks against it the way cousins bump shoulders at a funeral. We go because going is what makes the air stop sniffing around our door.

The plane is the same and also not, the way a face is the same and also not when it has been told a thing. The loadmasters run their hands over nets like mothers who have taught their fingers to count without letting the eyes get jealous. I touch the lines one more time because I have never been someone who thinks the last time is smaller than the first. The door opens and the air climbs in and lays down. The light performs its party trick. I say the words. I say them into a room that agrees to believe me. I think of Alyx and her drawings that make angles look like choices and choices look like geography. I think of my mother and the way she will pretend she knew this was coming and forgive me for not knowing the right recipe earlier. I think of cranes and knives and goats and frogs and men with lemon trees and women with jars of cake, and then I think of nothing because nothing is what you think when the count is the only prayer that works. We go. We are caught. We fall. We are named and unnamed. We land and the ground tells its old joke, the one about staying, and we laugh because it is a good joke and we are still the kind of people who can laugh.
