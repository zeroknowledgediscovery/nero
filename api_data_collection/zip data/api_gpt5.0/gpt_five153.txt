The night looked clean on the surface, polished and curated, like the fanged officials wanted it to be. Billboards carried pale faces that turned and nodded in unison when you walked beneath them. They blinked red text that followed your gaze: trust is compliance; connection is safety; like, share, say yes. Cars whispered along the arterial roads with their approved routes, and the Hush drones swept their cones of light across storefronts, rooftops, rivers. A city made tidy by fear always glimmers. Every window had a government sticker listing the household’s Engagement Score, stamped with a silver bat-wing crest, and if your score dipped into amber for more than three days your doorbell would sing, not with chimes, but with the low coo of something that knows your name in a language older than the State.

Iris North lived under one of those stickers that tended to flicker between blue and amber. She wrote for the Night Registry, a bland title for the publishing arm of the Magistrate’s office, which didn’t publish so much as smooth, buff, and lacquer. Her job was to compose bedtime stories the vampires approved of, parables full of proper morals: to plug in, to be counted, to share at least three opinions per day. The social—all of it through a platform that had stopped pretending to be a platform and had become simply the spine of society, the mandatory nervous system. You could call it Facebook, if you were old enough to remember the banal name and the bright layout that felt like a soda spill on a white table. The world had darkened since. It was now the Vein, an arterial brand, and the fanged ones swore through it.

Iris had stopped using her last name on anything public. It seemed safer. She had a hairline crack of a smile and hair braided back tight, so tight that strangers mistook her for stern or permanently suspicious. The truth was she daydreamed constantly, even under the lenses. She couldn’t help it; words had a way of blooming in her head without permission, making narratives from the coos of pigeons and the squeal of air brakes. It had once been profitable to be chatty on the Vein, a bit of a poet. Now it was dangerous to write anything that wasn’t the prescribed script.

The vampires were formal in public. They announced rules with the careful decorum of vicars. They smiled to show restraint. But rules were teeth.

“No curfew easy, no speech free,” old Marta on Iris’s floor muttered when she shuffled into the hallway to retrieve her ration bag. “They make soup out of the day. They let us sip. Just a little sun soup, once a week.”

Marta’s Engagement Score was permanently amber, an embarrassment to the building. She didn’t post the required ninety seconds of gratitude clips every morning. She often forgot to watch the nightly sermon-stream called Fathom, where Magistrate Rook—gray as piano keys, slick as rain—explained the new etiquette in a smooth baritone that made your bones feel like they were being weighed. Iris watched because not watching got you flagged. She watched and thought sentences about the way Rook’s words fit together like the moving plates of a jaw. She could see his speech patterns like a grid. She supposed she should be grateful to work adjacent to such rhetoric, to slip edits under doors the ghouled interns guarded. But gratitude felt like a mold on her tongue she scraped with her teeth.

On the night everything shifted, the billboards above the city rolled to a new campaign: unfriending is treason. The trees along the park were wire-framed; someone had done that, to keep vagrants from climbing and sleeping among branches. In the distance the heliostats that once flashed sun into dark corners stood idle like broken flowers.

Iris was late. She had a packet of sentences due; the Registry wanted an aspirational piece titled The Comfort of Compliance. She’d written two pages and then blacked out, not from drink, from a kind of friction burn of mind, a refusal that came like a tremor. Sentences bent backwards and writhed. She walked the long way to the central office, avoiding the scent-markers that indicated a Hush drone’s last patrol, and she spoke to no one. It was easier to move anonymous.

The door at the Registry was a vein itself, burgundy, pulsing with old glamour. She didn’t need to knock; the building knew her walk. Inside was chilled air and librarians with filigree tattoos on their temples—silver lines pulsing faintly as they curated videos of people crying with gratitude about having their accounts reinstated. You could sit in the corner and cry until the algorithm smiled at you again, at least that’s how the promotional fiction said it worked.

Jae waited for her at her desk. He was a friend you earned by making him laugh once. He had a hackish past that he paraded as if it were a boyhood of mischief; that made him less threatening to the vampires. He was good with the Vein’s code when you fed him coffee and compliments, bad with humans if you needed the blunt edge of empathy. He wore his Engagement in the green. He worked for the Registry too, slicing videos, baking them with the aroma of community.

“You’re late,” he said, not as a scold but as an observation. “You look like a raccoon that went to lit school.”

“You look like a raccoon that went to charm school.”

“I don’t pay tuition. What’s wrong with you?”

“Nothing. Words went on strike.”

“Take my last clip and reuse it then. No one will notice. They never do.” He leaned closer, the smell of mint gum and dust. “They are flagging unplugging jokes as terror-class humor now. Be careful.”

He meant be careful in the way city people mean it, tossed like a coin into a fountain. You wish the coin luck as it sinks. The Vein had dials for humor, which swung from permissible to felonious depending on the weather in the Magistrate’s head. Even sarcasm could be a citable offense if it was raining enough.

“I wrote that piece,” Iris lied.

“You did not.”

“I wrote the title. Isn’t that most of it?”

Jae shrugged. “The Magistrate is coming through the hall like a rumor on heels. He’ll want the drafts on his tablet to stroke. Did you do the mind-pace today?”

Iris didn’t answer. The mind-pace. That was another daily ritual: think six approved thoughts along a given track to keep your Vein profile coherent. It was a way to keep you plugged, like moving your foot to keep a sleeping limb alive. If you stopped thinking their thoughts, they said, you’d atrophy and die. Or worse, drift into stray animal mind, feral. It was always worse to be feral than dead. That was one of the rules: hide the way they prefer you to fear.

She had not done it. She had been watching the window and narrating the patterns of bird flight to herself: two gulls, two rules broken, a third thought that ran away laughing. She had felt the itch in her skull, a scratchy sweater you cannot take off. The itch said she was going to stop. Not just fail the mind-pace once but stop completely. She would leave the Vein. The idea came with that word—leave—and she tasted metal, the taste you get when you imagine jumping into water you know is cold enough to bruise.

“Stop worrying about my thoughts,” she said. “Start worrying about your hair. You have a Magistrate coming.”

Jae grinned, patted his curls. “He’s not my type. Vampires hate my blood; it’s too caffeinated.”

“I thought they didn’t drink blood.”

“They say they don’t. That they drink attention now. Upgrade.” He rolled his eyes. “But they still have fangs, Iris. You tell me.”

She opened her draft, or the place where drafts were supposed to live, and watched the cursor blink as if it were an animal refusing to cross the street. She wrote the sentence They take our days by making us love the nights back at them, then highlighted it and deleted it, replaced it with They make us safe enough to sleep.

Magistrate Rook passed her row without looking at her. His presence left a small vacuum where the room forgot to breathe. He stopped at the window and touched the glass, as if it were a screen that would react to his fingers. He said to the room, without turning, “I’m hearing more leavings.”

No one knows what to do with a vampire’s rhetorical “I’m hearing.” It is not a question, not a command, but you feed it anyway. Jae fed it. “We tightened the sign-out sequences,” he said. “We made people watch the sunset stream three times before they can request a temporary pause. We raised the pause threshold. People still feel the edge, Your Magistracy.”

Iris didn’t think Rook’s title was Your anything. She thought he was a dressed knife. She bit her lip and tasted iron again, whether from her thought or herself she couldn’t tell.

Rook turned, and she saw that his pupils were wide. He’d been feeding. He smiled at the room and the smile came off like a sticker, not meant for her, meant for the fabric of the space. “It is not my intention,” he said, “to make you feel as though you are always in danger of being devoured. I prefer you to feel as though you are always in danger of being unfriended.” He waited for the laugh. He got a tidy one. People laughed like they had been trained in a lathe. “If you encounter an urge to leave,” he went on, “remember the feeling of falling when an elevator drops one floor under you unexpectedly. Remember that, and how much you hate that feeling. Do you understand?”

“Yes,” the room said. Iris made her mouth say yes. Inside, three gulls reeled.

He left, and the room exhaled, and Jae muttered, “We are his elevator.”

She shouldn’t have laughed. She did, a breathy, see-through sound. It was the sound she made when she realized she was going to leave, and that she was going to use her mind to do it.

You did not unplug physically. There were no cords trailing from your skull. That had been the sci-fi of some prior era. The Vein was optical and rumor and oath. It nested in your attention and asked you daily to declare who you were; then it reminded you. To leave, you had to withdraw everything you had been telling it, like pulling a vine out of brick. You had to convince yourself first that you did not owe it your name. People tried often and failed and took to the streets howling. The Hush drones would gather the howlers. They called those the Mouthless. They ended up cleaning the window-edges of the Registry with toothbrushes for months. A cautionary.

Jae touched her wrist. “North. Seriously,” he whispered. “I saw your default go gray. Once. For a second. Yesterday. What are you doing?”

“Maybe I’m already gone,” she said, not as a joke. She felt strange saying it. Words do things.

“You can’t be gone if you’re having this conversation with me on company time.”

“Maybe it’s my ghost talking.”

“Then your ghost needs coffee.”

“Ghosts don’t need coffee.”

“They do here. It’s in the manual.”

She wrote the piece they wanted by borrowing lines and patterns from the last piece they wanted. It felt like taking an old dress and turning it inside out; the seams showed, but the seams were the only interesting part. She heard alarms in her spine. She didn’t know if they were hers.

On her lunch break she walked to the side exit that smelled like dust and court stenography. Pilar looked up from the crate she was sitting on. Pilar was an unlicensed courier, which meant she slid under the Vein’s watch with her chin down and her elbows forward, like a swimmer tackling cold. She ran errands between buildings for people who wanted whispers delivered instead of messages: down is maybe not all the way down, if you need me I’ll be where the furniture looks decrepit on purpose, the kind of code a city knows how to make out of scraps.

“You look like a trouble-sneeze,” Pilar said.

“That’s not a phrase.”

“It is now.”

“I need to ask you something you will laugh at,” Iris said. “And then you will maybe hit me, and then you will maybe report me, or maybe you will help.”

Pilar wiped her nose with her sleeve. She wore two scarves and a hat that made her head look like something bundled for storage. “You never ask this way. This is bad.”

“If a person were to… leave,” Iris said.

“Which building?”

“Not a building. The Vein.”

Pilar sucked her teeth. She glanced at the camera above Iris’s head and then at the camera above the other door, and then she took three steps to the left, into a blind spot so old that it probably had a name, like the Vanishing. She did not beckon Iris; she expected Iris to be smart enough to follow.

“Are you suicidal?” Pilar asked, flat.

“I might be,” Iris said. “But in the specific way that is the opposite of dying.”

“You weigh words for a living. Don’t act confused here. The only way to leave is to get dead by their records or to live off-grid on the water with the river rats.”

“The water’s netted,” Iris said. “They pull people back out and wash them off and make them take a pledge on camera, that they were only practicing drowning and they’re grateful for rescue.”

Pilar smirked despite herself. “You’re good at description. You’re worse at survival. Leaving is not a prose trick.”

“It is a mind trick, though,” Iris said, voice low. “I can tell. I can feel where it rods into my head. If I… if I go quiet where it wants noise, if I re-name myself in places it thinks it knows my nicknames, if I imagine my account punched like a paper ticket, holes in the numbers, and my photo turning into the back of my head. If I do it long enough and enough times and I don’t log into anything with my hands and I keep my face wrong to cameras, I think I can break it.”

Pilar stared at her. “This is the kind of thing people confess to priests.”

“I don’t know a priest. Priests post vlogs now.”

“Stop talking. Your words are making the air nervous. Try it then,” Pilar said, shrugging like a darestore clerk who’s seen it all. “See how long before you scream in the stairwell. You have to have someone at your door to high-five you when you’re screaming so the sensors think you’re having a party. Who have you got?”

“I have Jae.”

“No, you don’t,” Pilar said, as kind as she knew how to be. “Jae will tell you to stop and then he will call the recovery hotline on you and then he will cry. He is green-badge. He loves his life.”

“I have old Marta.”

“Now you’re joking. She doesn’t have enough breath to high-five you.”

Iris wanted to laugh again. She didn’t. The words in her head lined up. Sometimes they came like soldiers; sometimes they were birds. “Will you do it?”

Pilar was silent for a long time, letting the air around them thicken. A Hush drone rolled by outside, low enough that they could hear the gentle pop as it cleared its throat. “If you go feral,” Pilar said finally, “I’ll hit you hard enough to keep your mouth closed. I won’t call anyone. I’ll stay with you until your teeth stop chattering, and then I’ll go, because I can’t spend the night on your couch; they’ll see me. You have to promise to bite your tongue if you want to scream something they can record and use against you later. Bleed in your mouth quietly. That’s rule one.”

“Rule one,” Iris repeated.

“Rule two is that if you come back you’ll regret nothing and you won’t post an apology reel and you won’t become an activist with a channel that has ad breaks. You’ll either be gone or you’ll shut up.”

“Why would you help me?” Iris asked.

Pilar sniffed. “Don’t get sentimental. I help people cross streets. Also,” and here Pilar’s eyes softened despite everything, “my kid is somewhere in the Vein and I don’t know where. He was good at games. He beat them. They put him on near permanent streams. You know what that does? He is mostly noise now. If you find a way out, make a hole. Big enough for another.”

“I will.”

“You won’t want to share it. But you will,” Pilar said, and then her voice went sharp again. “Stop looking heroic. It makes me itchy.”

That night Iris went home and put green tea on the radiator and placed her phone face down in the bathtub, which was a mistake, because the phone whispered anyway. They whisper now; it’s part of the feature set. You want something that talks to you. Loneliness is treason too.

She sat on the floor and watched the radiator tick. Old Marta knocked once and stuck her head in the door and complained about the smell of cabbage coming through the vent. She asked for a cup of tea. Iris made one and handed it to her, and Marta’s hand shook as she took it, and for some reason that was the detail that made Iris cry—the shaking hand, the leaf caught in one of Marta’s sweaters. Old humans do not deserve this. Young ones don’t either.

“Why are you leaking?” Marta asked, not unkind.

“I am thinking about leaving,” Iris said. You could say things to old people you could never say to the young.

“Mm,” Marta said. “Using a boat?”

“My mind.”

Marta looked at the radiator, the window, the steam. “You will swing,” she said. “Like a bell. You will ring the room with your head and your body will not know how to sit.” She pressed her lips together. “You promise to chew.”

“I promise.”

“And when the police bats come,” Marta said, “you wink at me with the eye not facing the door.”

“I will.”

“Then go.” Marta took her tea and shuffled away, like a little ship going out to sea. She paused at the hinge. “Do not be proud when the floor meets your face. The floor has kissed better people.”

Iris smiled. It felt like a splint being put on and set. She turned off her lamps and sat on the rug and closed her eyes. She did not cross her legs. She did not assume a posture that meant meditation. She had learned enough to know the Vein could recognize postures. It could recognize breath. She did not breathe in any pattern she had been taught. She thought about bees.

She thought about bees and then about threads. She imagined the Vein as a net along the inside of her skull, laced to the soft tissue with invisible knots. At each knot, a story. I work here. I like this. My favorite is that. I love my dog. I am friends with. I am a good citizen because. She did not hate the net. She did not slam it. You never get out of something by kicking it; you snag worse. She imagined picking knots gently with dirty fingernails until each loosened and came away like a burr. She thought in errors, on purpose. She thought in the wrong language, one she half remembered from her grandmother: the words for bread and night, the words for leave the window open a crack. She tried to forget the structure of the posts she had made, the slots where one puts a like or a reply. She told herself that she had never told anyone the truth of anything. She told herself her name was not her name. She called herself No One, which is a magic name of sorts; It worked for a trickster in a cave once.

Her phone in the bathtub purred. It was a clever purr, the sort of sound that makes a cat person curious. It said—not with words, and yet, with words—Are you there, honey? You didn’t post your noon gratitude. She did not answer. She did not pick up. She did not hate it. She did not say goodbye to it. She let it talk like a radio playing in another room. Pilar had told her not to be proud. Pride is brittle. She let herself be ridiculous.

She pictured her profile picture turning around slowly, not to reveal the back of her head, but to show her looking over her shoulder and then walking away. She pictured all her tagged photos becoming shots of her empty chair, a glass with a ring on the table, a door closing. She thought in pictures because the Vein loved words. She decided to starve it where it fed on her best. She showed it images it couldn’t place.

Half an hour passed. Or a day. Or an hour. Her sense of time loosened like a tooth. She felt the first swing then, the bell in her bones. Her chest tightened, not with panic, not yet, but with an absence-of-something-coded. The Vein sends a quicksyrup through you when you think an approved thought: a pat on the head, a dog cookie. Dog trainers know what this does. You repeat the trick. Remove the cookie and the dog whines. That was the whine now, distant and almost sweet, and then stronger.

She swallowed and bit the inside of her cheeks. She tasted blood. It grounded her. Blood is always honest.

In a gray place you cannot measure, the net tugged. Something ran tabs and found her open windows and tried to hurry her process along. Please watch this bulletin. It is new. There’s a boy with a clavicle brace smiling about getting a second chance to be part of the community after a lapse into selfishness. The voiceover lilted. There is a link to click to pledge. She did not click anything. She let her head feel heavy. She let herself lie down on the rug and noted that it did smell faintly like dust and the feet of strangers (landlords do not believe in thorough carpet cleaning). Her heart thudded in her throat, and she thought of bread again, of years she had chosen to be hungry in order to write.

Then it came—panic, the real kind, the one with the spatial distortions. The room went too hot; her hands tingled; her spine poured ice. She wanted to get up and run to the sink and splash water and pick up the phone and open everything and apologize. She pressed her tongue to the roof of her mouth and pressed hard until her jaw shook. She remembered rule one. Chew if you must. She bit down and felt a little pain and let it be a metronome.

Her fingers twisted in the rug. She did not pray. She did not count. She let the panic turn a corner without following it like a dog. It turned anyway, left without her, walked down a street where the lights were broken. She lay and listened to her radiator trying to remember how to be a radiator. The phone burred. The pipes in the building chimed as someone upstairs showered. Old Marta coughed.

Something else fell away then, not a net, but a curtain behind a net. She had the oddest vision: a field of salt. White and flat. A sound like wings under dirt. A company of faces walking across the field, not human, not exactly, but not vampire either. They were eyes that remembered something before the Vein. They were the ghosts of friend requests not sent and invitations declined and parties not attended and years of silence. They were her quiet, made into a marching band. It was ridiculous. She smiled while tears leaked.

The phone went quiet. That was worse. The absence was a vacuum. Iris got up on her elbow and then decided she wasn’t allowed yet. She wasn’t going to check. She could not trust herself not to touch its slippery throat.

Someone knocked. Not at her door, but two floors below. Hush. Hush hush. The drones do that when they want people to turn and look so their faces can be scanned. She did not get up to look. She thought instead of bees again, clumsy, gold, too small to be gods. She told herself a story. She had not allowed herself to tell herself a story in years, not a real one, not one that mattered. The stories she wrote at the Registry were training dummies. She thought: once there was a woman who wore words like armor and found that armor is heavy in a river, and one day she let them all drop and fell naked into her own actual skin and found it fit.

In a small, silly miracle, the angles of the room changed. She felt them. She had never felt angles before—how a corner is a passage you can miss. It felt as if the building took a deep breath. The sticker by her door—they put one on the inside too—flickered. It went gray. Then it went black. Then it went off.

The relief came in a wave, which was the trap. The relief is when you decide to celebrate by announcing to someone. She picked up her phone and laid it on the floor, screen down on the rug. She did not touch it. She made tea in the sink in the worst way, because the kettle spooked her. She burned her tongue. Somehow, in that, she felt more alive than when she had been posting sunsets to please a vampire.

At midnight the power went out. That happened sometimes, to remind you that you are not the one turning the dials. The building muttered in the dark. Hush drones have their own eyes; they don’t need your light. But darkness is still something humans know. People cheered like it was a game. Two floors down someone started to sing, an old song about wolves. Old Marta knocked. Iris went to the door and cracked it.

“You look pale,” Marta said.

“I’m always pale, I’m a writer.”

“Don’t be cute. It makes the bats laugh.” Marta poked her, a testing poke. “Good. You have muscle. You’ll need it. Did you do it? Did you go out?”

“I think so.”

“Then tomorrow they’ll come ask why you are so quiet,” Marta said, and then, after a small breath, “When they ask you to show your profile page, you blink very slowly and say you’re tired. Practice being tired.”

“I am tired.”

“Then it should be a good performance.”

“Want to stay?” Iris asked. She didn’t know quite what she meant. Stay to what? To watch? To witness?

“Ha,” Marta said. “I make snores like trumpets. You will write a novel about the noise. No. If you shout, I’ll bang on the wall. We will pretend it is a party.”

“I won’t shout,” Iris said, and heard herself, and understood: she was learning to lie in the right places, the places where lies keep you breathing.

She lay again and this time slept, shallow as a ditch. She woke to the sound of someone at her door wearing authority. The knocking was polite in the way an executioner’s walk is polite. She swore softly and rinsed her mouth with tea to get the blood taste out.

A woman stood in the hall with a tablet held close, a sharp background hush behind her where two drones idled. She wore the badge of the Recovery Brigade: a stylized open hand, palm extended. She smiled. Her teeth were normal. Recovery teams often wore normal teeth to soften you.

“Hello,” she said. “We saw you missed your mind-pace. We saw a brief outage at your node. We’d like to help you. My name is Alix. We don’t want to punish. We want to accompany.”

Nobody wants to be accompanied by a cliff, Iris thought. She made her face not think it.

“I had an off night,” Iris said, with all the casual she could collect. “I’m writing. Sometimes I get in the deep spool. You know. The headspace where you forget to feed yourself. I’ll post a thank-you later.”

“You could post it now,” Alix said, friendly. “I can stay and we can do a gratitude reel together. We have ring lights in the van.”

Iris almost laughed and then didn’t. Ring lights for the grateful, ring lights for the repentant, ring lights for the disappeared. She had to shift the conversation off the smooth track. She let herself look at the corner of the doorframe and count a crack. “Later,” she said. “I have bedhead. It’s against the community guidelines.” She leaned in slightly and let Alix smell the tea on her breath. Let her see the sweat drying on her upper lip. Alix watched like a heron.

“It’s unusual,” Alix said mildly, glancing past her shoulder. “Most people miss their mind-pace when they get sad. You smell like adrenaline.”

“That’s how writing goes,” Iris said. “I do thrillers.” It was a risky joke.

Alix’s smile sharpened a millimeter. “Well, we’re here. Until noon,” she said, gesturing gently. “If you want to talk. We have comfort beverages.”

“Do you have bourbon?” Iris asked.

“Not a comfort beverage.”

“It is to me,” Iris said.

Alix shrugged. “We’ll be on the landing.” She didn’t threaten. She didn’t need to.

When Alix was gone, Iris shut her door very slowly and leaned her forehead against it. She heard a faint tapping through the wall as if old Marta had a spoon she was using on something grimy. Iris tapped back twice, soft, good. Later, she texted Jae a bland message. She didn’t send it through the Vein; she wrote it in a work window where the monitors were duller and the watchers more human. She wrote: They’re doing Recovery visits at my building. Be careful. He replied in under a minute: Want me to come? She stared at the words and felt the tug and wrote: No, thanks, I got it. She added a smile, the neutral kind, the one that scores well.

She showered, slow. Getting clean felt like work, like talking to your skin after ignoring it for a day. She left her phone under a book on the table, like a sleeping pet. She looked at it the way you look at a lover who wants something you cannot give without dying.

The morning wasn’t all dread. It was stupid: a bird landed on the rail of her fire escape and hooted, not like a pigeon, but like something trying to remember an owl. It made a sound in its throat and the sound stuttered, and Iris laughed out loud, honest, for the first time in weeks. She had expected leaving to be grand or horror-show. It was this. Small animal mistakes making you remember you’re an animal too.

In the afternoon, the Registry pinged her with actual human messenger. A boy in a blue jacket who would not make eye contact handed her a paper envelope. Paper felt illicit in your hands now. It had weight. She broke the seal. Inside was a card with a single word hand-inked: Dinner? Below it, a time and a place. The name signed at the bottom was Silas Thorne.

She had never seen the Overseer’s personal signature. She had edited his speeches from afar, added adjectives when he wanted to be fatherly, added a pewter chill to the nouns when he wanted to be feared. She had imagined his voice saying her full name once or twice as a joke. The card shook in her hand and she told herself it was not fear. You could mistake anticipation for fear. You could mistake bait for invitation. She set the card down and heard her heartbeat in the glass.

“They smell when people go off-grid in their minds,” Pilar had said once, under the bridge where the pigeons had learned to steal the ribbons out of girls’ hair. “They smell it like smoke.”

Iris dressed in gray so as not to advertise her blood. She wore tired eyes on purpose. She went where the card told her: to the north wharf where the sweet bombs of cotton candy used to bloom over summer nights. The stalls were shuttered now. The wharf cranes looked skeletal; they said please in another life. A car idled under a lamp. Its windows were black. A man stood with his hands behind his back looking at the water. He did not turn when she walked up beside him. He did not smell like smoke or old earth. He smelled like iron filings and a book you forgot in the sun.

“Miss North,” he said. He had the sort of voice that makes you think you should thank it for speaking. “I felt a flicker.”

“You mean my mind,” she said.

“I mean your noise,” he said. “It’s low. It’s remarkable.”

“Is that a compliment?”

“It is a compliment and a summons. You needn’t be frightened.”

“People who say needn’t are frightening,” she said.

He smiled. It was a surprise that his mouth, for all its calculation, could hold mischief like a coin. “You’re right,” Silas said. “Come eat with me. No lectures. Not tonight. I want to know how you came upon the silence.”

“I imagined I was a different person,” she said. “A person you hadn’t invented.”

Something in his expression faded and returned, like a cloud moved across the moon and then decided to hide it on purpose. “I did not invent you,” he said. “I curated you. It’s different.”

“Saying you curated a city is like saying gravity curates falling.”

His eyes warmed. “You are good,” he said, almost with admiration, as if she were a chess opponent who had stolen his knight with a pawn. “Do you know why we insist on your connection?”

“Because attention is your diet.”

“No,” he said, and turned to face her fully. “Because loneliness breeds monsters we cannot see. We tried letting you disconnect. We did. We let a city sleep in quiet for six months. The things that crawled out of the cracks were not us. I will show you dossiers if you insist on proof. We do not insist on connecting you to feed us; we insist to shield you from yourselves.”

“That is the nicest way anyone has ever described a leash,” she said softly.

He spread his hands. “Write me a nicer way then. Write me a policy poem that makes a compromise delicious. You wanted to be a revolutionary; fine. Do it with syntax. But do not merely vanish. We will chase you. That is our nature.”

“I didn’t ask you to be our shepherd,” she said. “We know how to be wild without eating each other.”

He smiled with old sadness. “No, you don’t.” He paused. “And yet. There is a quality in you I would prefer on my side. I would like to give you space to work. Quietly. With our funds. No more registry pap. Something… noble.”

“Propaganda in nicer shoes?” She felt tired. He was seductive in the way art dealers are seductive when they tell you that you have genius you do not possess and you should sell it now. She glanced at the water, gray on gray, the kind she loved. “No.”

“Think,” he said, not annoyed. “The alternative is messy.”

“The alternative is mine,” she said.

He inclined his head. “Then let us make a deal, if you are determined to play dangerous. If you are going to go silent, do it incrementally. Do not turn a switch off with dramatic flair. That creates alarms. You will make me look foolish in front of my own. They will demand I punish.”

“I’m not your apprentice,” she said.

“You are my subject,” he said, and the word did not mean thrall so much as moved piece. He touched the railing with two fingers and then pressed those fingers to his lips, as if he knew a superstition and didn’t mind indulging it in front of her. “When you begin whatever it is you intend, Miss North, remember this: respect is a currency that spends in every market.”

“Then spend some,” she said.

He laughed. “I am. I am talking to you instead of having your door opened with a polite ramming device.” He stepped back. “Dinner will grow cold. Will you come?”

“No,” she said. “But thank you.” She let a hint of a bow into it to make sure he walked away believing she had been the polite one. He left then, without drama, his car opening like a mouth that was glad to see him.

She stayed until her knees ached. She imagined not falling, but standing. She imagined putting a word in the world that would make a hole. She had not set out to make anything. She only wanted not to be eaten, not even by the softest mouth.

On the walk home, someone fell into step with her. Not Pilar, not Jae. The gait was off, new, like a musician trying to learn how to walk without hearing every rhythm around her. Iris almost wanted to laugh from nerves, but then the figure spoke.

“You said no to him,” the woman murmured, and Iris knew from the voice, not the words, the class of person. She was one of the Unlisted. There is a small population that the Vein could not stomach or could not integrate or gave up on labeling. They grew like weeds in abandoned lots and sometimes blossomed entire universes you couldn’t sell tickets to. “Good,” the woman said. Her hair was shaved and painted with a chessboard, squares uneven. Her eyes were unlit.

“Who are you?” Iris asked.

“Name changes,” the woman said, delighted. “I haven’t decided today. Call me Soft Clock. Your phone stopped purring. Do you want to learn how to keep it sleeping?”

“Yes,” Iris said, taking care not to crush the word with gratitude.

“We teach. You’ll make errors. You’ll call a deer a horse. Who cares. We’ll keep your mouth busy when it wants to spill. Most importantly, you’ll stop thinking of yourself as a single person leaving a party, and start thinking of yourself as a person turning around and finding a door where there was only a wall. And then you’ll open the door for others. Your hands will hurt.”

“I don’t know how to lead,” Iris said.

Soft Clock’s grin had a chip in it. “Good. We don’t follow leaders. We follow gravity. We find each other when the floor slants. But someone has to start saying the nouns. That, there, watch. Don’t call it what they call it. You write. You know names. You should know how dangerous that is and how necessary.”

They turned down a side street where the streetlamps had been painted with vines by whoever had lowered them on their hinges in the night and climbed up. Human mischief remained. It made her brave.

“How does it start,” she asked. “If I want to… if I want to leave not just my page, but this arrangement. If I want to teach them the L word.”

“Love?” Soft Clock snorted.

“Later,” Iris said. “Another L. It’s—respect.”

The woman’s head tilted. “You said it like your mouth had to relearn the shape. Good. How do you teach vampires respect?” She looked up at the night as if it had a whiteboard written on it. “You give them a new night.”

They reached Iris’s building. Voices on the stairs, Recovery’s cheerful hum. Iris put her hand on her door. She turned. “Tomorrow,” she said to the Unlisted woman she had just met and would possibly die for in a month. “Teach me to make holes in the Vein without leaving sharp edges for the children.”

“Tomorrow,” Soft Clock said, backing away with her hands in her coat pockets. “Bring tea. Honey too. Your tongue will need it. And bring a list of names.”

“My name?”

“All the ones you’ve been hoarding.” She laughed once, a bright, birdlike sound, and then she was gone around the corner, a vanishing act done without declaring itself magic.

In her apartment, Iris stood in the middle of the rug again and felt the building noticing her like a gentle animal recognizing a hand by smell. She looked at the book under which she had slid her phone. She slid the book aside. The phone lay like a sleeping fish. She turned it over. The screen was black. She touched it. Nothing. She felt a drop of something in her throat that was both joy and terror. She picked it up and put it in the freezer, which was old advice but good. You freeze that which tries to bite and whisper; you use old remedies in new wars.

She listened to old Marta snore like a trumpet and thought of armies forming out of breath and sleep and small rules spoken in kitchens. She made tea and typed one sentence on paper, a paper she would hide in the lining of her coat. It was the first sentence of something that would outgrow her and everything she thought she knew about language and the city and the moon.

The sentence was simple. It said: If we must share, let us share refusal until it is a city again.Chapter 3

Morning opened with a polite scrim of cloud and the feeling that the building was chewing over a new opinion about her. Iris woke before the first appeal ping from the Recovery Brigade and held still, listening to the small ecology around her reassemble. The freezer whirred. The radiator coughed. Old Marta, faithful horn section, warmed up with a muted snort and a socked shuffle. Iris slid her hand into the lining of her coat to feel the crisp edge of the paper there, reassured by the grit in the fold. She had written her sentence with a pen that left a stubborn line, and somehow the drag of ink across pulp made the idea feel less ornamental and more like a tool. She took the paper out, read it once, and tucked it still deeper, adding a new ritual to the day: check the sentence the way you check a lock.

She put on tired the way girls used to put on kohl. She brushed her teeth until the gums tingled and then blinked very slowly at the mirror, practicing the blink old Marta had prescribed. The profile sticker on the inside of her door was a dead eye. It made her nervous the way a silent baby makes a mother nervous, which enraged her and made her smile at the mirror with her teeth covered by her lips to test if she could look harmless. She put the phone in the freezer on a bag of peas and closed the door gently like one closes a sleeping box with a snake in it, and then she stood in the kitchen and counted to ninety in the wrong language, skipping every seventh number because mischief is medicine.

Alix’s brigade had changed shifts; the cheerful hum on the landing had a new timbre. When Iris opened her door to fetch the sterile loaf the building left on every doormat, Alix’s replacement—a man with shoulders like shoved bookends and soft eyes that belonged to an uncle in a family comedy—nodded at her. He held a tray of white cups with precisely printed labels: CALM, CLARITY, CONNECT. Iris declined with a gesture so small that he could pretend he had not seen it. He seemed grateful for the fiction. Recovery liked willing saves. Coercion left stains.

Old Marta cracked her door a thumb’s length and made an obscene gesture at the cups. Iris snorted and then smoothed her face. She lifted the loaf and felt its unnatural spring. “Bread that bounces,” Marta said, voice like a chisel. “Throw it hard enough and you could take a drone out.”

“It’s armed with raisins,” Iris said, and Marta’s mouth opened in a little triangle laugh that ended in a cough. Iris wanted to tuck Marta under her arm and carry her out of the building like contraband, but human bodies are heavy and states are heavier. Instead, she poured tea into a chipped mug, and they passed it back and forth across the threshold like contraband warmth.

Pilar texted at nine with the bravery of someone who had lived through many mornings in a city that tried to edit you. She didn’t use the Vein pipeline; she wrote the way a carpenter writes measurements on a floorboard with a pencil. Meet at the den with the furniture ghosts. Bring nothing you love. Iris tucked the coat paper deeper, hid the freezer with a tea towel as if Recovery would respect domestic modesty, and left her apartment with the kind of walk that says I am busy, but not so busy I am suspicious of my own legs.

The furniture den had its door painted the green of old chalkboards. Inside, everything was pretending to be asleep: couches with quilts over their faces, chairs tipped belly-up on tables as if a tide had gone out and left their ribs showing. It smelled like dust, lemon oil, and the shadow of tobacco. Soft Clock sat cross-legged on a rug that had learned too many histories. She had two compatriots with her, one a narrow boy with a birthmark like a crescent bruise cupping his jaw, and the other a broad woman wearing a sweater printed with a school of fish that had been sewn in upside down. The boy looked like a question you weren’t sure you wanted to ask. The woman looked like the answer that would make you change your life.

“Names for today,” Soft Clock said without preamble. “Wren.” She patted the rug near the boy’s knee. “He’ll show you how to lower your noise without holding your breath and passing out. Temple,” she added, nodding at the woman. “She keeps holes from fraying. That will be your problem if you insist on being sentimental about edges.”

“I’m Iris,” Iris said, then caught Soft Clock’s smirk and corrected herself. “No One.” The boy grinned at the Odyssean joke, which made Iris love him at once and fear for him equally.

Temple nodded, serious as a judge. “Even No One leaves a dent on cushions, honey. Sit. We’ll teach you the ghost step.” Her voice rolled like a slow river. Iris sat and felt the den tilt toward her like a patient willing to listen.

They worked without screens or postures the Vein recognized. Wren taught her to blink, not slowly like a sedative, but with a stutter that disagreed politely with cameras. He showed her how to breathe in a shape that was not on any corporate wellness poster, small and foolish, like blowing to keep the steam off a spoon. “We call it lowing,” he said, showing teeth like a fox. “Like a cow calling its calf, but under all that, it’s a dial. The Vein hears you better when you’re symmetric. We teach you to wobble just a little, always. They like metronomes. We like jazz.”

Temple unrolled a tote bag filled with analog noise. She had bracelets that made a sound like beetles in grass, laminated cards with clashing patterns to steal the eye, and a little battery-operated fan whose blades were painted with an optical lie. “Devices crave your geography,” she said. “We deny them maps without calling it war. When you walk, you do not go in straight lines from A to B. You bounce off C, not to deceive, but to remain multiple. You put lint under your lenses and call it fashion. You change the rhythm of your stairs. You wear hats for reasons that would make a vampire write a sonnet and go lie down.”

Soft Clock watched Iris try a few steps of ghosting near the couches, then put two fingers to Iris’s shoulder blade to adjust a tilt. “You have a writer’s spine,” she said. “It wants to look down at the page and up at the sky, both. That will serve you. But you think in sentences first. The Vein will bait you with words until your hands twitch to answer. We will teach you semantic salt. Sprinkle it on their verbs. Everything tastes wrong to the algorithm when the verbs are misfit.”

Wren handed Iris a card with a nursery rhyme printed on it and asked her to read it aloud into a cheap microphone they had jammed into a desk drawer to make the sound soft. Iris hesitated. The rhyme was the kind you sing to children in better centuries. It felt like contraband. “Go on,” Wren said. “Read it wrong.” Iris blinked and then did, swapping hungry for sleepy, boat for mountain, river for hair. When she finished, Temple clicked her tongue in approval. “Yes. It will hear you and think you are close but not quite catchable. Close keeps you alive when far gets you fetched.”

They had rules written on laundry tickets pinned to a lampshade. Rule one was Pilar’s: chew if you must squeal. Rule two was Temple’s: never cut a hole and leave a burr. Rule three was Soft Clock’s: do not build a religion; build a recipe. Wren had the last rule: carry chalk, always. It gave you the right to write on the world—lines, arrows, corrections, little herb names under weeds someone else would call junk. Iris held the stub of chalk Wren offered with reverence usually reserved for relics or keys to old houses. It left a ghost on her fingers that made her proud.

They told her about Cozy Mode while they ate stale sesame buns and drank coffee that had learned to be fierce in tins. The Vein had introduced it overnight, a feature with a voice like a well-educated aunt. Cozy Mode would auto-generate your presence when you were busy being alive. It would post gratitude professionally tailored to your habits. It would smooth your sentiment so no one would worry you were sad. It would, the pamphlet said, “accompany your absence with warmth.”

“That’s the opposite of what we need,” Iris said. “We need the absence to be a door you can see.” The sesame bun turned sour in her mouth. She thought of Silas Thorne by the water and his deft talk of shepherding. “Cozy is plaster. Plaster covers holes. We need apertures.”

“The Unlisted agree,” Soft Clock said, eyes glittering with a mischief so pure it felt almost like music. “So we will un-cozy the city in patches. We call them misprints. Not big enough to make a speech about. Small enough to snag a smart mind walking past. A grocery sign that reads wrong for a day. A bus route map that loops back on itself. A billboard that shows chicks learning to fly with an instruction manual written in recipes. You will write some. You will fold refusal into the bread of the day so it tastes like something we have always been eating.”

Temple unfolded a cloth that hid a small mechanical clutch and a jar of birdseed. “Holes want tending,” she said. “We leave something for the creatures who use them. A woman slips free of the Vein’s mouth for an hour and ends up in a laundromat with nothing to do but touch metal and sway. We arrange for her to find a note, a thermos, a place to sit where the camera has cataracts. We are not the first people to run a resistance. We are simply the current ones, and we must be less dramatic and more kind.”

They planned a Hushparty in a laundromat on Harkness, where the washers had a hum like mansions dreaming. Iris went to scout with Soft Clock and Wren at dusk, when the Hush drones loved to garnish the air over the avenues and citizens loved to pretend drones were seagulls. The laundromat had been painted with murals that were almost childish: blue octopi shaking hands, cats in frothy collars looking at the moon, a woman with a basket of stars instead of socks. The cameras were old and smoked around the edges. The clerk was a girl with hair the color of a warning sign and a look like she could balance a full tub on one hip and a revolution on the other.

“You’re early,” the girl said. “I don’t sell detergent to people who talk about feelings aloud. That’s my policy.”

“We came to ask about your machines,” Soft Clock said, deadpan. “Do they believe in privacy?”

“They believe in noise.” The girl shrugged. “Noise is honesty with less poetry. I like them.”

“We will bring a cake,” Wren said solemnly. “That is our policy.”

The girl’s mouth tugged. She handed them two rolls of quarters the way a priest hands out wafers. “Do not make a mess. I will not go to prison for lint.”

The Hushparty was not posted. It was not whispered to more than a handful. Pilar brought napkins with faces printed on them—celebrity faces with the eyes punched out. Temple brought two thermoses of broth so the mouth learns salt without needing an algorithm to remember thirst. Soft Clock brought a timer that looks like a tomato. Iris brought her paper sentence in her coat and did not show it to anyone, because it was still a seed, and she had learned the hard way that seeds spoken in the wrong room become husks.

The first to come was a woman whose shoes squeaked new and expensive. She was trembling and furious at her own trembling, which Iris recognized as the only honest shape fear has before it goes rhetorical. The second was a man whose neck had been stiffened by years of nodding. The third was a child of indeterminate gender with a sticker on their cheek that said THANK YOU in blocked foil letters. Pilar stood by the door with a face that refused to be polite. Alix did not come because Alix did not know, but the hum outside had a pattern that says recovery vans cruising slow like sharks.

Soft Clock made them all laugh by telling them the rules again. “Chew, don’t narrate,” she said. “Lower, don’t flatten. If you feel you are slipping and you need a hand, raise your pinky like you are asking the queen for tea. We don’t do heroics. We do minutes. Ten will get you through the first tangle. You can do ten of anything, including being a person and not a page.”

They put quarters into the mouths of the old machines. The machines purred like satisfied cats. The room filled with the honest clatter of buttons in drum and zippers complaining. Iris felt calm and then panic and then calm again like waves that had learned to keep their tricks to themselves. She watched the woman with the squeaky shoes bite her lip until it turned white and then pink again. She watched the child take the THANK YOU sticker off their cheek and stick it on the side of a washer as if to ward the machine against benevolence.

They were ten minutes in when the door opened with the polite knock of bureaucracy. Alix stood there with the same smile she had offered on the landing. Two drones peered in like children who had been told to be good in a museum. The laundromat quieted in a way Iris had learned to fear—a stillness that meant lungs were preparing to behave themselves like obedient animals. Soft Clock wiped her hands on her jeans and stepped forward with a meatspace grin.

“Evening,” Alix said. “We heard there might be an event.”

“A wash,” Soft Clock said. “A spin. Is there a law against making your sheets smell like something besides institutional lemon?”

“We worry,” Alix said, and there was genuine worry under the fluff. Iris saw it and understood that Alix had her own narrative where she was shepherd and not wolf. “People harm themselves when they disconnect too quickly. We like to be present. We can accompany.”

“Tonight we accompany each other,” Temple said. The drones took a tiny step backward, almost indetectable, as if the sentence were a heat source. “We have our own ring lights,” Temple added, and pointed at the fluorescents, which hummed with the cheap indignation of old lights told to look pretty.

Alix glanced at Iris then and tilted her head as if to say: are you proud of this? Iris did not blink slowly. She blinked like something in her eye had decided to go on strike. “Would you like to do a gratitude reel about laundromats?” Alix asked her. The question was so on-script that Iris almost smiled.

“I did one last week,” Iris said. “I cried about the smell of soap. The numbers did well.”

“We didn’t see it,” Alix said, and the normal teeth parted slightly. Iris did not look toward the freezer in her mind. She thought of bees, then ships, then bread. “I’ll forward you the link,” she said, which was a lie and a genius move if she could backfill it later by planting a link where she had to.

Soft Clock did a thing then that Iris would remember as a benchmark for leadership that rejects the costume of leader. She put a quarter in a washer as if it were a collection plate, and the washer swallowed it and hummed, and Soft Clock said, “If you stay, you put fifteen minutes of your day into the machines and you listen to someone breathe. You do not sell us calm. You sit.”

Alix, who had probably done yoga enough times to have a mat with a satirical name, hesitated. The drones looked at the coin-altered math. Alix’s hands were free. Her face softened, and then the line of duty came in under her eyes like a shadow drawn by a careful hand. She put her quarter into the nearest machine and sat on a molded chair that had known many wet asses and small dignities. The drones moved back to the door and pretended they were lamps.

People breathed. No one made a speech. The child whispered something into the drum and then smiled to themselves, and it did not matter what the something was because they had made it little enough to carry home. Iris lowered her noise without flattening it, and it felt like a secret accomplished, like making a soufflé stand in a city that had burned so many ovens. Ten minutes is short and long and forgiving if you do not ask it to be more than it is. The timer, shaped like a tomato, rang with a petulant ding that sounded like a cartoon chef complaining about the soup. Temple laughed out loud in violation of some small rule and no one died.

When Alix left, she put her hand on the doorframe in the way of someone noting a landmark in a place they might need to return to without a map. “Be careful,” she said, and it was not a threat. It was the coin you toss when you are making a wish you can’t admit to because it would end your employment. Soft Clock let her go without delivering a victory line because victories like that sour into slogans by morning. They cleaned lint trays. They left the room tidier than when they came. Respect spends in every market, Silas had said. Iris used it like a counterfeit note that was good enough to pass in dim light because it was printed with something like love.

Jae called that night with a voice sprayed in something nervous and mint-flavored. He did not use the Vein. He used a work connect that hung between them like a taut rope, and as soon as she answered he looked ashamed of having thrown it. “I had to,” he said. “I dreamt your freezer buzzed. Are you okay?”

“I’m alive,” she said, which is an answer and a poem and a dodge. “How’s your hair?”

“Betraying me,” he said automatically, and she loved him for slipping into the old rhythm even with alarm tented over them. “They put me on a watchlist,” he said then, abrupt. “Not a bad one. A professional one. I have a dashboard for people who make noise like whales, and I saw your line go thin. Don’t ask me how. I can’t tell you without telling you. I can’t stop them from seeing you. But I can distract for twenty-seven seconds if you need to… breathe differently.”

“Twenty-seven seconds is a religion,” she said. “Thank you.”

“I don’t have a religion. I have coffee,” Jae said. “And I have fear like a pet I never asked for. Rook likes you. That is not good.”

“Silas likes everyone he can imagine using,” she said. She let his silence be honest. Then she asked, gentler than she felt toward anyone wearing a badge of the institution, “Do you want to come to a party that is just laundry?”

“I don’t think I can,” he said, and his no was a bruise she refused to rub. “I think I would ruin it. You know the smell of someone who has been listening to sermons so long they carry the afterglow? I have that. It clings.” He swallowed audibly. “Please don’t get romantic about death on me, Iris.”

“I am falling in love with breath,” she said, which was the only comfort she could offer that did not turn into activism with a tip jar. “Go sleep. Dream of raccoons who graduated with honors.”

He laughed wetly and hung up before apology could curdle. She put a pot on to boil, not because she wanted tea, but because gas flames had their own kind of sermon and she missed hearing preachers who were simply physics. The freezer hummed. The phone dreamed cold dreams with its teeth clicking in the frost. Iris pictured the Vein watching her absence and knitting a sweater of presence around it, Cozy Mode purr-purr-purring so her friends would not worry. Rage came up for a moment and then went back to its kennel because this was not a rage day; this was a thread day.

Silas sent another card the next afternoon. Paper again, as if tempting her with a texture that says: I am not a network with teeth. The envelope smelled faintly of cedar and regret. The note inside had no dinner invitation, only a sentence that made her stomach tilt. Respect is a currency. You have begun spending. We can finance you. It was signed with the same precise hand and a postscript in smaller script: Do not mistake my interest for mercy. The paper felt as if it had been held near a fire and snatched back in time.

Iris took the card to the furniture den and laid it on the rug. Soft Clock looked at it and rolled her neck. “He understands you are a sentence-maker,” she said. “He thinks a stipend will keep you honest.” Wren walked the card to the window and held it to the light to see if there was a watermark, which there was: a faint bat wing with the parts labeled like a science drawing. Temple tore the card into four neat quarters and then into eight, then into confetti, then put the confetti in a jar with lavender and shook it, making a sachet that would make drawers smell like gardens instead of men. “He is financing us already,” Temple said. “He pays the drones that we teach to leave us alone. He pays the billboards we misprint. He pays the librarians to file videos of people crying into the wrong drawer so they never play. We simply reroute what he spends.”

Iris did not frame her first sentence publicly. She did not put it on a wall or a screen. She wrote others, small and sly, and folded them into places Cozy Mode could not reach. She wrote on the inside of mittens at the thrift shop in pencil no one will notice until some hand goes cold and turns the knit inside out. She wrote on the underside of a saucer at the diner that still had pies that tasted like recipes old women had whispered. She wrote under the lip of the park bench where teenagers carved the names of those they loved and those they wanted to love them back. If we must share, let us share refusal until it is a city again. She watched three teenagers read and not know they were reading and laugh, and the laugh was the human version of a power cut with candles.

Pilar brought news that was a bruise pressed. “They upgraded the doorbells,” she said, rolling her shoulders as if the city itself had gotten heavy, which it had. “Now they can speak with any voice you love. They will call your name in your grandmother’s mouth. They will say darling in a voice you miss so hard your stomach tips. If you answer, it flags you as susceptible, and then they escort you tenderly into a bandwidth where you forget what you were practicing.” Pilar sat on the rug and let herself lie backward in a way that would have been maternal if she weren’t the one who needed mothering. “I want to kill something without losing my soul,” she said to the ceiling. “Tell me a trick, writer.”

“Name it wrong,” Iris said, and Pilar’s laugh came from deep in her belly and sounded like relief with edges. “If your grandmother says darling through the door, say sorry, roof, I can’t talk right now. If love calls, call it a chair. If it calls again, call it soup. If it calls again, call it weather. You cannot be hunted if your hunter cannot name you. The world has spells. We were taught to forget.”

The Hush drones grew curious. That is the trouble with useful monsters; they learn. They began to swing their light cones so that laundromats looked like stages. Soft Clock countered by draping the laundromat window with a banner that said CLUB SODA in hand paint, and the drones, confused, accounted for this new Club and moved on, because Clubs were on the permitted list if they partnered with the Vein’s nightlife schema. Recovery tightened their lids. Alix stopped by Iris’s door and leaned on the frame with the look of a woman whose job had begun to leak into her dreams. “You have clean sheets,” she said. “You look less tired.”

“I am practicing my tired,” Iris said, and Alix, who understood the kind of joke you tell to hide the blade, nodded like a woman who has seen knives and prefers spoons.

They did not rescue Pilar’s kid that week. Sometimes revolution is a long spoon digging at hard sugar. They did pull a girl out of a loop. She was a silver-voiced gratitude streamer named Tamsin who used to begin every clip with a breath stretched like silk and the phrase neighbors near and far, which made you feel you lived in a postcard. Tamsin had been flagged as Perfect for so long that she had stopped swallowing. The night she came to the laundromat she was wearing a yellow sweater that made her look like a metaphor for nice weather, and her eyes were so dry that Iris wanted to cry for her. They put Tamsin in front of a machine and told her to drop coins with intent. She did not want to. Perfect does not like to hear its coins clang. Temple held her hand while it shook and said good, like a coach watching someone lift something honest. When the first panic hit, Tamsin made a sound like swallowing a bird, and Pilar hugged her hard and said, “Bite your tongue if you want to scream, and if you must scream, sing the alphabet wrong.” Tamsin sang it with curses inserted at random and started laughing halfway through, and that was the sound of silk turned rope turned bridge.

The next morning, the billboards glitched along the arterial road that fed the Registry. For eleven seconds, long enough for five hundred eyes to see, the pale faces blinked wrong. They turned their heads, smiled, and the mouths spoke not trust is compliance, but trust is a verb; spend it carefully. The red text stuttered like a drunk uncle trying to be serious and then read like a toast: unfriending is practice. The Hush drones stuttered and then surged to wash it away. Jae texted a single word: bold. He added a raccoon emoji that the Vein had failed to make sentimental. Iris wrote back three dots because three dots have always meant so many things humans do not trust machines to understand.

Silas Thorne did not ring a doorbell in a voice she loved. He sent a book with a spine the color of bruised plums. It was a book he had commissioned last year—a collection of permissible rebels who, in the Vein’s telling, had practiced dissent responsibly, which meant with ring lights. Inside the front cover, he had underlined a sentence about necessary rebellions and wrote in a pale pencil: you get to be necessary or you get to be erased. He was not wrong; that was what made him dangerous. Iris placed the book under the leg of a table that wobbled, and the table steadied, and she smiled at the utility of the literature of her enemy.

The Vein began to send her Cozy Mode suggestions it thought matched her voice. Iris read one that almost worked and felt a professional ache in the place where she once loved the architecture of a sentence even when it sold soap. It said, today I learned the difference between nursing and nibbling my attention. She laughed because it would be so easy to let the machine mimic her under her own nose and tiny crimes begin to look like compromises. Soft Clock saw the look on her face and pinched her arm black-and-blue. “We do not get high on our own elegies,” she said. “Write something ugly, Iris. Write something that eats in corners. They won’t know what to do with your appetite if you stop setting a table.”

Iris wrote lists instead of essays for a while, lists you could fold into a pocket or tape to the underside of a trash can lid. Reasons to Sit In Silence and Not Die. How to Chew Without Blood. The Names of Things You Can Call Love, Today Only. The last list had thirty-one entries and made a teenager cry behind a skate park ramp until his friend handed him a helmet and said hit me if you have to. The boy did not. He threw the helmet at the bats on a billboard instead. The helmet fell and hit the ground and made a hollow sound like plastic refusing to be heroic. The boy laughed at himself and then went home without a screen and slept like someone who had been fed.

She saw Alix once at the market buying green things as if she intended to live. They stood in line and pretended to be strangers who notice the price of cilantro. Alix said, very softly, “Your friend with the chessboard hair has a warrant for mischief. They don’t call it that. They call it minor data infection.” Iris smiled with her mouth and asked the vendor for carrots in a voice that could cut paper. Alix left with a bag of limes and did not look back. Respect went into the till and came out as change.

The night after the misprint billboards, Iris heard the building make a new sound. It was not pipes. It was not drone. It was the sound of the doorbell downstairs calling someone darling in a voice made out of three different recordings of three different dead people woven with algorithmic love. She went to her peephole and watched a neighbor’s hand go to their mouth. The hand trembled. The door opened halfway and then closed and then opened a drunk inch. Iris put her forehead to the wood and whispered sorry, roof, and then she went and boiled water because boiling water is a prayer that never gets appropriated.

When Soft Clock was taken for two hours one afternoon, the city felt like a coat missing a pocket. She came back with a bruise in the shape of a respectful hand that had been respectful too hard. They had asked her questions like a mother asks a child where they hid the candy. Soft Clock had answered like a child who had eaten the candy and licked the wrappers and could not bring herself to pretend she had not loved it. “They know we misprint,” she said, sitting on the rug, back to the sofa that had belonged to three different lives. “They want to hire me. I told them my rates. They laughed like ice in a glass.”

“Did you tell them we don’t have a payroll,” Temple asked, gently pressing a bag of peas from Iris’s freezer against Soft Clock’s cheek because some remedies are permanent.

“I told them we have a potluck,” Soft Clock said, her grin lopsided with swelling. “I told them we have cakes shaped like laundromats. I told them we sing the alphabet wrong when we are trying to keep our mouths from saying the truth. They think it’s cute. Cute is camouflage. Let them.”

Wren made a chalk mark at the baseboard to record the trouble and the return. He had a ledger on the wall that meant nothing to a camera and everything to anyone who understood what it tallied. Visits. Pings. Lost things. Found things. Lint. Laughter. Bread thrown at drones. It looked like art if you had a gallery opinion. It looked like a list of survivors if you had ever needed one.

Iris finished a page of sentences on paper and tucked it into the coat with the first. The page had no author. It had no title. It had breath. It said: If you can’t leave, lurk. Lurking is not cowardice; it is apprenticeship. Watch for seams. Do not let anyone sell you a hero mask; it pinches and makes your face itch until you mistake discomfort for truth. If you must pretend, pretend you are clumsy. Cameras hate the ungraceful. If you must pray, boil water. If you must love, do it out loud in kitchens.

That week they learned another thing: holes are invitations, and invitations attract not only the tender and the tardy, but traitors who turned because the rewards were clean and the fear was honest. Someone brought the Recovery Brigade a list scrawled on a paper bag. It had three names, one of which was accurate. Alix knocked on Iris’s door with a face that showed nothing, which is a face that shows too much. Iris brought her into the kitchen and poured water and made a cup of something with lemon and rind and a leaf Pilar had sworn was medicine. Alix stood and did not drink and said, “If the list was yours, I would have been more formal. It wasn’t. But it had a shape like your writing. Wrap your fingers differently around your pencil.”

“I will,” Iris said, and she meant both things. She would erase and she would change her grip. Alix looked at her mouth and the corners of her eyes like a cop in a film who wishes she were a poet in a field and then nodded and left. Respect again, exchanged silently, deficit and surplus impossible to measure with a calculator.

Silas Thorne appeared casually on a screen in a deli that made soup in kettles as big as bathtubs. He didn’t do that often. He preferred distance, a hand on the back of your neck from a balcony, not a face by your soup. He spoke about civic warmth. He spoke about Cozy Mode the way a surgeon speaks about a new suture that heals cleaner. He did not say a word about misprints. He bent kindly over a bowl of borscht and asked the deli lady if she had enough beets and then tipped too much cash because the eldest arts are not immune to bribes. Iris watched him and felt the old seduction rubbing her like oil. He was a handsome argument. She reminded herself that handsome arguments rarely look you in the eye when you’re on the floor.

That night, gulls wheeled in three’s above the river and landed in messy triangles on a rusted barge. Iris thought of the first time she had told herself she might already be gone. She was not gone. She was here. She had friends with names that were not their names. She had a freezer with a phone in it like a fish whose eye she refused to eat. She had an old woman pounding a spoon on a pipe as code for you are not alone. She had a sentence in her coat that was already less hers than she liked. She had a city beginning to slant.

When she slept, she dreamed the door at the Registry was a red animal that wanted to be her friend and could not help showing her its teeth. She dreamed the librarians wept silver from their filigree tattoos into bowls that filled and filled and never spilled because the bowls were algorithmic. She dreamed of a field of salt and the faces again, not vampire, not human, not machine, but the shapes we wear when we decide to be more than the convenient sum of our data. In the morning she woke with chalk under her nails and a sense she had written a word on the sky that the sky might keep.

The magneto letters on the laundromat’s sign were scrambled by some human hand so it read Clod Sub, which made the child with the THANK YOU sticker laugh for five minutes and then sit down and do their homework like the act of laughter had cleared a small artery. That day, ten people came and ten people left and none were dragged. That night, three more billboards misprinted a heartfelt sermon into something awkward and therefore true. Iris walked home past one and smirked at the winged crest that had begun to peel at the edge like a sticker that would not hold even when you burnished it with a spoon. She wanted to take a corner in her teeth and pull.

At her door, the bell sang in a voice that was almost but not quite familiar—her own, spliced. Darling, it said without saying. Iris pressed her forehead to the wood and whispered, “Sorry, soup,” and the bell stopped and Recovery passed on like weather. She went inside and boiled water because she could not find a better prayer and she suspected none existed. She took her coat down, unfolded the papers, and added a line that came to her as easily as a breath. It said: The first war is with the stage directions. Once you put the script down, the room becomes a forest. Walk like a deer until you remember you are not prey.

The city glittered that night as always, made tidy by fear, its glimmering so practiced that it had become a rhythm you could dance to if you decided to be rude. Iris lay on her rug like a person who had earned the right to lie down on her own floor, and she looked at the angle of the ceiling. It felt like a passage you could miss. It felt like a seam you could pull. It felt like respect, finally, spent without permission, accruing interest in a form the Vein could not track.Chapter 5

By the time the posters of grateful children were swapped for posters of Cozy Mode holding hands with a cartoon moon, Iris had learned to treat every improvement like a cough in a crowded room. The Vein marketed care the way cemeteries market quiet. She walked through the city with her coat a little heavier from paper and chalk and the freezer at home humming with its cold fish, and she listened to the new pitches with her head cocked as if someone at a party had leaned in too close to tell her a joke she had already heard in a worse voice. The billboards now showed living rooms with soft lamps and newsfeeds tucked under blankets. The slogan, typed in a font that wanted to look like handwriting, told her that absence had never felt so accompanied. It made her want to nail the word accompanied to a doorframe with a rusty nail and see if it would bleed.

Soft Clock brought a map that was not a map to the den and spread it over the rug while Wren shook out the coins in his pocket like someone preparing to bribe a river. It was a photocopy of a zoning plan for the city’s light circuits from a decade ago, overlaid with pencil notes that looked like a child’s treasure hunt. Temple weighed it down with a jar of lavender confetti. The map showed the heliostats like broken flowers in the corners of the district, still wired, still technically obedient to a command if anyone had a throat that could sing the right note into them. It also showed the Loophouse, which was how the Unlisted named the studio complex where the Vein filmed gratitude and reform narratives until they were glossy enough to use as mirrors. It was near the heliostat field by the river where someone had once put on a light festival and called it Blossom. Now it was a building made of cameras and praise.

“Your courier friend’s boy,” Soft Clock said, not bothering to soften her voice into pity. “We have eyes on the Loophouse. He is there in a room named after an adjective. They name the rooms after virtues now. He is in Bright.”

Pilar was all elbows and bite in the corner, as if her whole body had trained itself not to become a plea. She had wrapped one of Temple’s scarves around her knuckles the way boxers tape their fingers. Iris watched her and tried to keep her face in the shape of respect instead of hope because hope is brittle and sharp and cuts you when you touch it wrong. “We don’t storm,” Temple said, tapping the map as if it were a drum. “We can’t. The Loophouse drinks the alarm for breakfast. But we can misprint the street outside until the drones can’t find the door. We can borrow a uniform and deliver a cake shaped like a clipboard. We can be foolish enough that the serious men watch us like a show and miss the hand swapping the real card.”

“Cozy Mode is going to use the Loophouse as their test kitchen,” Wren said, pushing a roll of tape across the rug with one finger. “If we touch it now, they will swat. If we do not touch it, Pilar’s kid is a flame under glass and they will talk about him in seminars later as an example of how their method works. There is no time that feels like the right time to do a wrong thing well.”

Iris felt the sentence climb into her for later use. Wrong thing done well. She marked it in the chalk place in her mind. She thought of the heliostats not like flowers but like old mirrors on hinges, the kind that women used to adjust to catch their own face in a small oval of winter light. She remembered Silas by the water saying loneliness breeds monsters we cannot see and wanted to write him a letter that said your monsters are bored and starting bands. Instead she traced a line from the heliostat field to the Loophouse with her finger and said, “Can we make light that acts like noise? They taught the drones to love lines. Can we give them flares and scatter until their cones become daisies?”

Soft Clock grinned at the word daisies and nodded without looking at Wren, which meant she trusted him to make a machine that could hum long enough to wake up a flower. “We can move a mirror,” he said. “The maintenance protocols are still human in places they forgot to dress in passwords. I can sing badly at a control panel if someone gives me twenty-seven seconds to cough.”

Jae’s twenty-seven seconds felt like luck and theft rolled in paper and tied with string. Iris kept his number in the work-connect like a charm that would break into pieces if she used it at the wrong time. She texted him a question that was not a question: You said whales. Can we have a whale now at the river at dusk? He wrote back after a long minute during which she pictured him looking at two dashboards like a man staring at a fork in a road marked FEED and FREE. He wrote: If you anchor your whale to 18:14 and leave before 18:41 I can make weather. She felt a stupid happiness in her chest and wanted to cry and bite her tongue at the same time.

They rehearsed the entrance the way thieves once rehearsed chapel bows. Pilar practiced holding a cake shaped like a clipboard with her shoulders down and her chin neutral. Temple stitched a patch onto Iris’s coat that made her look like she belonged to the city’s water authority because water workers are the sort of people even drones grow tired of scanning. Soft Clock taught Iris a loop of words to throw at the Loophouse guard when they asked for a ticket number, a loop of nouns that sounded like data and felt like soup: docket, socket, logic, sprocket. The trick was to be so close to nonsense that you were a day away from becoming poetry. Guards like feeling as if they are dealing with people who do not have time to be poetic.

At dusk, the heliostat field woke with a creak Iris felt in her teeth. Wren had told her that if metal did not complain it was lying. The mirrors turned their faces like cold birds and waited for a note. The Loophouse’s front desk waited as well, not with a note but with a nail polished to the color of bruise and a voice that was trained in the art of announcing welcome like a court sentence. Iris stood with Pilar and Soft Clock in the vestibule while Temple sat in the van with her hands on the wheel like a woman prepared to drive backward through time if necessary. The Hush drones slid past the glass doors in pairs like sea creatures that had learned to enjoy looking like policemen.

The desk woman looked up and made Iris feel like she had brought the wrong kind of fruit to a complicated funeral. Pilar held the cake and stared at the woman with such clean hatred that Iris put her shoulder against Pilar’s sleeve to tilt the angle of it down. “Delivery for Bright,” Soft Clock said in a voice that had recently learned the word chipper and was punishing it. “New Cozy kit. You’ll want it on camera for tonight’s behind-the-scenes.”

“Who requested it,” the woman asked without moving her mouth all the way to the question. She wore a badge with the word SINCERITY in a font that could sell soft drinks without needing to show a bottle.

“Your boss’s boss,” Soft Clock said. “Silas Thorne’s assistant’s assistant’s out-of-office send. Do you want paperwork or a war crime?” The question was so ridiculous that it went under the woman’s training and tickled her actual brainstem. She snorted, small and human. Pilar did not blink, which would have made her look robotic if her left eye hadn’t been slightly bloodshot in a way that made you think of long nights and taxis. Iris took a breath in the wrong shape to make the cameras yawn.

The gate beeped and opened with an obedience that felt like a conspiracy. Wren’s whale note found the heliostats then, the mirrors tilting their faces to catch a sky that had begun to pink like a shy fruit. They threw the light not at the Loophouse door but at the street outside, at the teeth of the Hush drones, at the smooth pavement where the drones liked to leave signatures in light. The cones blurred and flowered, shadows becoming petals, and the algorithms, which were new to daisies, paused to call a supervisor. Twenty-seven seconds is a village if you’ve built the houses.

Inside, the hallways had the faked warmth of rich cabins on boats that will never see ice. Each room name was spelled tastefully in brushed metal by the door and also on the floor in a softer font in case you were looking down to calibrate your sorrow. Bright was three turns to the left and one to the right and then a corridor lined with framed prints of people crying into their own palms in very flattering light. Pilar’s shoulders fought her, wanting to flatten and widen the way shoulders do when they have decided to break doors. Soft Clock breathed a little misstep into the rhythm of their walk to keep the cameras from getting a clean line. Iris carried a clipboard with nothing on it but a shopping list for soup and held it like a badge.

Bright had two doors: one for staff and one for values. The staff door had a card reader that Temple had made friends with while they were in the van. Iris held the reader up to her hip like she was checking her pulse and the light went green out of habit. The values door opened onto a room where history was being filmed. Tamsin’s yellow sweater had been replaced by a robe the color of a flattering dawn and her mouth was trained around neighbor as if it were a bit. She was not in Bright. She was on a poster in the hall. The boy in Bright was thinner than Pilar’s memory and wider. Screens eat faces and give them back in new aspect ratios, and the Vein had given Pilar’s boy a face a little too good for the format he’d been allotted. He sat in a chair that looked like a dentist had designed it after a breakup. A ring light bathed his cheeks in mercy. He was saying the word grateful with the precision of a knife that has never been used to cut anything but fruit.

Pilar made a sound in her throat that Iris had not heard a human make. Soft Clock put her body in front of Pilar’s body, not as a barrier but as a canal, and Pilar flowed through her and into the room with a clip that made Iris think of hunters who have pawned their own guns and learned to catch with their hands. A technician turned and opened his mouth to call an adult, realized he was one, and then tried to raise his hands in a gesture of universal workplace calm. Iris stepped into his field and nodded as if to say I see you when she meant I see how you are going to stand when you tackle me. She held out the cake like a weapon. He looked at it and did what men do near cakes, which is to postpone violence.

“Gull,” Pilar said, and the boy’s head turned like a lid loosened after months. His eyes were full of the kind of grateful he had been trained to produce, but at the edges Iris saw hunger, and hunger was an animal that could still learn its own name. He was strapped, not with cuffs, but with compliance. Cozy Mode had been born before their eyes and it was a cradle with silk ties. Pilar cut the silk with her teeth. Soft Clock pinched the ring light’s cord at the wall and put it into her pocket like contraband rope. Wren’s whale sang again somewhere in the city and the hall lights dimmed for a polite moment that would read as ambiance if you were the sort of person who has never had to run. Iris put her body behind the technician’s and whispered “alphabet but wrong,” and the man did not understand until the boy began to sing the letters out of order as if they were escaping his throat, and then he frowned in helpless professional interest.

When the first wave of panic came for Gull, it was more like television static than fear. He shook like a set that has lost its channel and tried to speak in the kind of sentence Cozy Mode writes when you are asleep. Pilar bit her own tongue while she whispered rule one into his ear, chew, and Soft Clock gutted the chair’s straps with a tool that looked like a toy but was not. Iris turned toward the second door because she could feel voices approaching and knew that when voices approach they bring bright, bright, bright. She stepped into the value frame and said, “Excuse me, we’re testing Cozy’s new manual calibration,” and she stared at the nearest camera like she was a camera and there is nothing cameras like more than being looked at by their own kind.

They walked out the staff door with a kid and a cake and a lie that weighed exactly as much as a person who has almost died and decided that the next breath is something people should drink. The hall let them go with the offended dignity of a hotel allowing a party to spill into the lobby because asking them to stop would be a scene. The woman at the desk frowned at them not because they were criminals but because she had been trained to respect cakes. Outside, the drones were still flaring daisies. Temple pulled the van up like a woman arriving at a family picnic late to avoid a conversation. They climbed in and the door closed and every adult in the vehicle inhaled as if drawing breath shields. Wren, who had stayed with the heliostats because he was the only one of them who could sing badly enough to be convincing, texted a single expletive that Iris read as praise and terror.

Gull did not speak for an hour. He chewed. Pilar sat with her hand on his knee like a woman feeling for a flood. Iris watched his mouth turn from script to slack to shape. When he spoke he did not say something profound or cinematic. He asked for water. Temple passed a bottle back with a smile that would have made a drone apologize for humming too loud. Gull drank and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand the way children do when no one is policing dignity. He put his head on Pilar’s shoulder without permission. Pilar did not cry yet. She began to breathe like someone who has been holding her breath under dirty water and finally found a surface.

The Loophouse did not send a squad. The Loophouse sent a letter to Pilar’s building that used words like unauthorized and lapse. It suggested a consultation. It included three coupons for Family Gratitude Night at one of the city’s partner venues. Pilar put the coupons in the freezer with the phone and closed the door and leaned her forehead against the humming, which was starting to feel like a choir. Recovery came to Iris’s landing and knocked on Marta’s door by mistake and left a pamphlet called How to Cope with Absence Shade. Old Marta opened it, scoffed, and used it to wedge a window that refused to stay open at a satisfying angle. Respect, spent, becomes function. She sat in the draft and drank tea that Iris laced with mint because mint tricks the mouth into thinking something clean is happening.

Silas Thorne did not appear by water. He called a meeting of the Registry and stood under a chandelier that had been tuned to flatter faces that needed no flattering. He spoke about the incident at the Loophouse without naming it an incident. He smiled at Iris once like a spider who has read some Greek. He announced a Respect Tithe that would require every resident to attend a Public Affirmation Walk once a month in their borough. It was a parade with ring lights. It was a leash disguised as confetti. “If you hate it,” he said in a voice that could sell knives or lullabies, “it is because you misunderstood the word public. Correct your understanding and you will be back in the circle of warmth.” Jae texted Iris from the back of the room where he was pretending to be a vine on a wall. He wrote: I can bend the Walk route by two streets. Do you want me to? She wrote back: Not yet. Let them draw their own net first.

Alix found Iris in the market again and made eye contact for too long for two women who were not meant to know each other. “You were stupid,” Alix said near the butter. “You were kind. You gave me paperwork and you took a child. Those are not things you can do in the same afternoon if you want to keep your afternoons.” Iris considered telling her that in a former century people had given cake as a metaphor for contempt and this had not gone well, but she did not feel like being clever. “Are you going to arrest me,” she asked instead, and Alix blinked slowly for the first time in months and shook her head an inch.

“I am going to attend a Public Affirmation Walk and clap as if someone I love is being married,” Alix said. “And I am going to watch for the misprint you are going to stitch into the route like a seam ripper. And then I am going to go home and sit in my tub and put my head under the water and listen to the hum of the building and pretend it is bees. If you make me choose between my pension and your laundry parties, I will choose my pension until I don’t. Do not make me choose this week.”

The Walk went like festivals always go: too loud and too controlled. Bats on staffs marched with volunteer smiles. Children wore hats with the crest on them and threw biodegradable glitter that dissolved on contact with moral superiority. The city loved a spectacle because spectacle is a kind of anesthesia. Soft Clock did not try to spoil it. She added a cord. She and Wren and Temple had mapped the route by foot and chalk, marking the stones where the street cameras knelt and the doorways where old men sat to count parades. They placed chalk under the wheel of the lead van the way sailors leave coins under masts and spoke their own words into the pavement in a whisper. Iris wrote poems for asphalt and pretended they were jokes. If we must march, let our feet remember the alleys. If we must clap, let our hands remember how to work.

The misprint was not on a billboard this time. The misprint was the sun. At 18:14, as they passed the heliostat field, the mirrors blinked their eyes. They turned their faces and laid a ribbon of light over the Walk that was just a little too warm to be pleasant and just a little too bright to be handsome. The ring lights washed out. The drones squinted invisibly. For eleven seconds, everyone looked ordinary under a light that did not care about gratitude. The crowd actually cheered because it felt like weather. Silas Thorne, watching from whatever room pride watches from when it wants to gather a detail for later use, narrowed his eyes in his lover’s way and smiled with one side of his mouth as if someone had told a joke that insulted him with style. He would have to be careful. Respect is a currency, he had said, and Iris was spending it in coins that made noise when they hit the table.

Old Marta did not attend the Walk. She sat with her trumpet snores and her tea and watched a bird land on the rail outside her window and try to remember how to be an owl again. She forgot to post her morning gratitude and forgot to apologize. Her sticker stayed dead. Her doorbell sang two notes of a song it did not know the words to and stopped. Iris brought her a biscuit that bounced. Marta threw it at the wall, missed, and laughed until she cried and then patted Iris’s knee like a metronome. “We made soups out of days once, in the war,” she said, because old women remember wars that ate men and left recipes. “You were too young then. Now you are not. Stir, girl. Don’t let it stick.”

Pilar’s boy slept in Iris’s apartment on a mattress that had learned how to be a mattress in the back of a thrift store. He woke at three and counted his fingers out of order and smiled like he was drunk on his own skin. He did not want screens. He wanted a radio that played static. Iris gave him the bathroom fan and a chair and he sat and listened like a priest. He asked for the alphabet and Pilar sang it wrong while she cracked an egg and slid it into a pan with a hiss that sounded like a small rebellion in oil. They ate quietly. They did not say the word saved. They did not say the word forever. They said sip and salt and cloves. They said names that were not their names and the room seemed to like it and keep the secret.

The Vein responded the way bureaucracies respond to mischief with good grammar: it issued an update. Cozy Mode would now include “Light Compensation”. If your living room went too bright, Cozy would bring the feel of twilight to your feed. It would weight your posts with an algorithm designed to soothe. It would increase your “Ease Score”. Iris read the release and felt an exhausted hilarity lick her ribs. The city would be comforted to death, tucked in until it stopped moving and could be framed. She wrote a sentence on paper about the dignity of discomfort and slid it into her coat and imagined someone else reading it in a coat she would never see. She looked at the heliostat field in the distance and thought about tacking the light again, not to blind or to burn, but to draw on the side of a building a word big enough for a drone to read and too human for it to pronounce.

Jae sent a photograph of his dashboard scribbled onto a napkin in pencil. It looked like music about to happen. He wrote beneath it, I can make the captions drift on Fathom for 23 seconds. The closed captions had become a fashion; everyone watched with the sound on and the words at the bottom like a tickertape that made you feel smarter than you were. Iris met him in a doorway behind the Registry where the cameras were too old to understand the jokes teenagers told with their hips. He looked like a man who had heard too many sermons and still ate bread. He kissed her forehead with the affection reserved for people who could get you killed and made you laugh anyway. “Write me the wrong words,” he said, and she went home and wrote a prayer with verbs that moved like dogs released into a field.

They watched Fathom in the furniture den with the sound off and the captions on. Silas’s mouth opened and closed with the precision of a lock, and at the bottom the words said not, as he said, citizens, you are doing so well at being in the circle, but something else brisk and silly and therefore true. They said, a circle is just a line learned to love itself. They said, if you bend enough, you forget your hinge. They said, if you must nod, nod at a neighbor who has a door that sticks and bring your shoulder to it. For twenty-three seconds the captions wrote sense against the surface like waves writing a warning in a language only dogs and children can hear. Then the system hiccuped and recovered and punished the silly by erasing it completely from the replay. The room, which had held its breath like a bell, sighed and laughed like a river that has seen many dams and knows how to go around.

That night, Silas did not send a card. He sent quietly an unmarked envelope that contained a printout of a photograph from a security camera in the Loophouse hallway. In it, Pilar held the cake. Iris had her hand on a clipboard. Soft Clock’s grin betrayed a tooth. On the back was one sentence written in pencil that looked like it had been sharpened with a knife: You are not prey. Walk like it. The sentence was either a threat or a compliment or a prescription. Iris put it under the table leg that wobbled and the table steadied, and she told herself that function is not surrender when you choose the use.

The next morning, a child in a hat read the chalk under the lead van and frowned and wiped at it with a shoe and then smiled when it did not budge. He was not old enough to be counted yet. He had a face like a raisin before you soak it. He looked at the ribbon of misprinted light and put his hand over his eyes and squinted and said to no one in the tone of someone discovering a personal law that would never be legislated, I can see better when it’s too bright. His mother told him not to be rude to the spectacle. He wrapped his words up and put them in his pocket like lint you refuse to throw away. At the laundromat that evening he traded the words for two quarters and the right to watch a machine make foam out of beaten water. No one had to tell him the rules. He bit his tongue and grinned and lowered without flattening and left the door on the machine open a crack when he was done so the drum would dry without smelling like something died in it. Respect spends in every market.

Iris woke the day after and knew she had to go back to the Registry. The dance of absence requires presence to spin against. She brushed her hair back so tightly it felt like she was pulling a line taut and walked into the burgundy door with her head full of verbs. The librarians’ filigrees pulsed as always. The interns looked ghouled as always. The red animal of the door smelled like a kiss you are glad you didn’t accept. Jae looked at her and looked away in a way that said I will not betray you this hour and also I am already betraying you by staying. Magistrate Rook’s smooth baritone slid across the room like light engineered to flatter monsters. When he passed Iris’s row, he said, not looking at her, “Do you know the difference between antlers and antithesis, Miss North,” as if he were asking about the weather and she were a girl at a counter folding paper napkins.

“One grows in winter,” she said, not needing the question to be real to answer it. “The other gives you something to push against when you forget why you have a spine.”

He smiled the sticker smile and continued. She sat at her station and opened a file that wanted to become Cozy’s foghorn and she wrote a sentence about the way fog eats sound until you learn to sing from your knees. She edited someone’s video of a woman who had been forgiven for unplugging by promising to plug in twice as hard and she removed two adjectives that made the repentance taste like cream and replaced them with nothing. She typed a note to a file that would be read by a human and a machine and in the human part she said, politely, this segment runs long and in the machine part she tucked a misprint into a metadata tag that said daisies. She mimed obedience and practiced tired and left on the hour she was supposed to leave even as the building’s sticker tried to decide what color she was allowed to be.

At home, the freezer sang. Old Marta smacked the wall with something metallic, a private code for I am still here that made Iris absurdly happy. She took the papers from her coat and wrote a new line below the others, hands cramping a little from all the holding she had done that week. It said: If we must be seen, let us be seen as we are when we are not being watched. She read the sentence aloud to herself and imagined it on the underside of a saucer in a diner that still served pies with rude honesty. She folded it with the care of someone putting a letter into a pocket before a long walk and then sat on the rug and put her back against the couch and closed her eyes because sleeping in the armor of a day like this is as holy as any ritual a state can borrow and sell back to you.

The city glittered politely. The bats on the crest peeled a little more at the edges where humidity loves to test glue. The Hush drones recharged under a bridge that still smelled like fish and teenage fights. In the heliostat field, a mirror angled itself as if hoping it could reflect the inside of a human skull. In the Loophouse, a technician bit into cake and felt a confused love for the criminals who had fed him. On Pilar’s couch, a boy slept a sleep made of alphabet scraps and relief. In Alix’s tub, a woman put her ears under water and heard the building hum and told herself they were bees. In a furniture den, a ledger grew chalk lines that made no sense to the untrained eye. On a laundry sign, someone had rearranged magnet letters so it read SUB COLD and the child with the quarter decided to use both meanings at once. Iris lay with her arm thrown over her face like a woman who knows tomorrow is ridiculous and dangerous and refuses to be poetic about it until morning.Chapter 7

They put lace over the city the morning the doorbells learned lullabies. It wasn’t real lace, not at first, but an ache for it—the kind old women make with their fingers while telling you about a war that is not the war you are fighting but teaches you your enemy’s gait. The update called Lull Mode rolled through the Vein like syrup through a throat. If your score dipped, your bell would not coo in an ancient language anymore; it would hum in a voice that guessed the shape of your childhood and tried to nest in the hollow of it. Neighbors woke with the feeling of having been tucked in by a country that did not love them and hated the honesty of their discomfort. Iris woke to the whisper of her own voice saying darling, which was technically impossible given the freezer, and she went cold in the middle as if someone had drawn out the metal taste and set it on her tongue like a coin.

Old Marta had her answer ready, not because she had read a release note, but because the body remembers rules it learned in rooms where you kept blackout curtains folded like clean laundry. She knocked on the wall with the spoon she claimed she was born holding and called without turning her head, “Bring me string, girl. Bring me string and a needle big enough to stab a pig.” Iris brought her a mending kit with thread that had waited in a drawer for a gentler century. Marta clicked her tongue, insulted by the smallness, and shuffled to a box under her bed that smelled like cedar and secrets. She brought out a skein the color of brackish rivers and needles that could knit teeth together. “The bats don’t read holes,” she said, sitting like a queen on a cracked vinyl throne. “They read blocks. We will give them water. We will drown their greedy eyes in lace.”

Temple came to listen the way a woman trained in metal listens when someone offers a soft weapon. She sat on the floor and watched Marta’s hands feed string into a pattern that had the logic of vines and habit and mourning. The texture grew like a hedge, regular where it needed to be to hold and wrong where it needed to trick. Wren brought a drape rod stolen from a classy apartment and the three of them held the net up to the light. The light fractured softly and the room calmed as if someone had taught it to nap. “We hang this inside laundromats and windows that face their cones,” Temple said, the decision not grand, and therefore binding. “We make our own weather.”

The neighbors pretended not to watch as Temple and Wren climbed stools and tied lace where surveillance expected glass. Hush drones drifted past with cones out like tongues and stuttered when the pattern spoke in a dialect they had not been trained in. Iris felt a perverse tenderness then for every quiet craft that had been laughed out of modernity. A drone tried to focus, then relaxed, then moved on as if it had decided to forgive a mistake. Cozy Mode logged fewer stress responses in that hour and sent a cheerful bulletin to Recovery. Recovery smiled, leaned back, and missed the way Marta’s hands stitched the edges with respect so no burr would snag hair or memory.

Gull woke late and walked through lace light and reached for it with a smile that did not ask permission. He pressed his cheek to the net because he had learned during his months in Bright that everything soft was a performance, and the surprise of genuine softness knocked his breath. Pilar watched him rub his face like a cat and bit the inside of her cheek until she tasted iron. She wanted to feed him eggs and also hand him a map to the water. She wanted to be a map and a meal and could be neither, not completely. Iris made toast that bounced and they laughed without making a speech about why laughter tastes better when it is impolite.

Jae wrote on a napkin and sent it through a courier who charged three kinds of respect as fee: the promise of a secret, a coin, and a story that could make him laugh later at a bar. The napkin said that Fathom’s next sermon would be filmed not in the studio but at the Viaduct Theater, a space the city had not let die because acoustics that good feel like a civic virtue. It also said that the captions would be hardened against drift for forty-eight hours unless someone inside juggled the error budget. He drew a small whale next to the numbers and a stick raccoon applauding. Iris took the napkin to the den and laid it on the rug where their map, not-a-map, had grown a thumbprint patina. Soft Clock bent over the napkin like a child plotting treasure and grinned at the word Viaduct as if it were a cake shape she hadn’t tried. “We say the big word there,” she said. “Not on a billboard. Not in captions. On stone.”

They had been flirting with the idea of a word in the sky since the evening by the heliostat field. Wren had hummed equations like lullabies while he explained how mirrors are obedient but stupid, and how you could tilt them to lay a ribbon of light long enough to write a vowel if the day agreed. The drones had taught them daisies. The Walk had taught them that a ribbon of honest light can make a crowd look ordinary and therefore beautiful. The Viaduct had arches like throats and stone that had heard centuries of footsteps pretending to be music. The plan was not to blind or to burn. The plan was to lay a word with a tenderness so disrespectful it might pass for weather. They argued over the word the way families argue over names for babies they won’t register. No had power and too little grace. Enough had a roundness Iris loved but a sermon taste she distrusted. Respect was correct and also a mirror, which makes you want to fix your hair instead of your habits. In the end it was old Marta who settled it without knowing she did by muttering while she knit, “Not yet, not yet, you don’t give them the good soup before the stock’s ready, you teach their mouths patience.”

Not yet was a door you could see. It was refusal without the drama of goodbye. It was a promise and a delay you could live inside. Soft Clock wrote it on the air with her finger as if testing its weight and nodded. Wren bit his lip because Y’s are greedy in light and would make him swear. Temple drew it on the map in pencil and then erased the pencil and let the ghost of the graphite be the instruction, because if you plan something you need to love erasures. Iris copied the shape into her coat pocket in ink that bled just enough to make the tail of the t linger like a string.

Alix sent no card and no text and appeared like weather on the corner where they bought oranges that remembered sun. She didn’t wear her badge. She wore a sweater you could imagine someone loving her in. “You will do something at the Viaduct,” she said, not bothered by being obvious. “I cannot stop you. I can map the exit routes so no one’s grandmother is trampled. The Walk Tech won’t be there. They don’t trust the acoustics. The drones will double. The captions will be smug.” She handed Temple a folded city plan as if she were returning a borrowed casserole dish. “If you must be clever, be kind in the margins. I am tired of writing reports that translate ‘almost’ into ‘accident.’”

Iris wanted to hug her and did not. She wanted to say come and did not. Respect spent in that moment looked like accepting the plan and not pretending Alix had not put her employment on the table and then pulled it back like a hand from a hot stove. “We will leave their edges polished,” Temple said, and Alix’s mouth twitched because kindness from the mouth of a woman who could pull a van through a needle is a strange luxury. She walked away like a person who had decided to live to a later chapter without knowing if the writer would allow her.

The city was busy pretending to be gentle. Cozy Mode had added a feature that translated police bulletins into “Neighbor Notes” with emojis. The drones started making a soft chime when they passed a school. The billboards showed hands holding hands in clean kitchens while pots simmered on induction plates and the captions told you that connection was warmth and warmth was safety and safety was progress and progress loved you. Iris went to the diner with the pies and wrote under a saucer, If you are warm, check who is cold. If you are safe, check who is missing. If you have progress, ask what it costs when you pay attention. The waitress with wrists strong as bridges slid the saucer onto a table where a man sat with his son and pretended to be fully present, and the man read and nodded in a way Iris allowed herself to believe had nothing to do with her and everything to do with the way people are when you remind them they are people.

Jae and Iris had their argument in a stairwell because corridors know how to keep secrets if you lean your forehead just so against plaster and make the angle trust you. He wanted to yank captions again and draft a sentence into Silas’s mouth that would turn to thorns. She wanted to let the mouth have its hour and put the word in light instead. “This is not an art project,” he said, and he was right and wrong in equal measure. “People will get arrested for your poetry.”

“If we wait for them to teach us math, we will die swallowed and tidy,” she said. “The word buys us minutes. Minutes teach hands. Hands open doors. You cannot hack the room if the room has already been tricked into remembering the forest.” He scrubbed his face as if the ring light of his life had left oil there. He wanted to be the man who fixed it without making a speech about fixing. He was also the man who made speeches with code that sounded like wind in a bottle. He bent, exhausted, and kissed the back of her hand with a gratitude that embarrassed them both. “Your not yet makes me ill with love,” he said, and it was the worst and best confession available in the time remaining to them.

They built rehearsals into the day like small animals building closets for beans in a house with too many eyes. Wren sang to metal in alleys until it remembered how to be mirror instead of appliance. Temple drilled the ghost step until the den floor wanted to dance. Soft Clock led reading circles for misprints, which is to say she gathered a handful of people and showed them a bus map that looped on itself and asked them to talk about how it made their feet feel. Gull, who had laughed at lace, showed a pack of kids from under the bridge how to lower without flattening by teaching them to blow on spoons to keep soup from burning their mouths. He had not yet told Pilar that he sometimes dreamed of the ring light with fondness and hated himself for it. He had not yet told Iris that he had started to hear in the drones’ hum certain notes that sounded like words he might love later. He did not tell Soft Clock that he valued rules because rules were teeth and you want to know which mouths are open in your room.

Silas Thorne sent no paper but appeared in Iris’s peripheral vision three times in one afternoon. Once he leaned against a rail while interns carried tripods down a hallway and murmured into the air as if the building were a man he could flirt into compliance. Once he stood in the back of a market and watched a woman choose peaches with reverence and did not buy one because he understood the value of watching full loops. Once he sat in the Viaduct with his legs crossed like a man at peace and listened to his own sermon rehearsed by a junior reader whose voice had a nick in it. He looked almost bored. People in love with their own power often do in the hours before a spectacle. Iris did not turn her head toward him in any of these rooms. She let his ghost test the air and met it with lace.

They scouted the Viaduct at an hour when custodians own the world. The arches held a cold that knew how to respect sound. Iris stood where the stage would be and spoke the word not yet under her breath and felt the stone note it. Wren mapped the light path old-fashion, with string and pins and chalk on stone, because when you ask mirrors to do something improper you owe them ritual. Temple checked the exits and ran her palm along a railing like a carpenter asking if the wood would splinter under panic. Soft Clock put her ear to the floor and laughed because the whole space had a hiss like cloth—a good omen for anyone trying to slip something under a giant’s door.

Alix’s routes worked in the rehearsal that mattered, the one where fear tried to dress up as the friend who always arrives early. She stood at the back with her sweater and her pencil and her absence of badge and watched the room learn where to flow. She showed Iris a corner where a misprint could live without hurting someone’s ankle. She showed Wren a socket the city had forgotten to label. She told Temple where Recovery liked to stand when it wanted to look supportive and be very ready to move. She took Soft Clock’s hand and squeezed it like a woman who is violating three codes at once and decided she would swallow the report and let the acid do its work.

Old Marta did not come. She sent the lace instead in the hands of a boy with knees like arguments and a grin that looked like teeth had been late. “She says to fix the corners,” he told Temple, parroting wisdom as if it were a joke, which made it easier to hear. “She says if you must put holes in their night, at least hem.” He waited while Temple nodded like a river and then asked, “Do you pay for mischief?” Soft Clock handed him a roll of quarters like a sacrament and told him to save his receipts. Gull taught him the alphabet wrong on the curb and the boy ran off singing it like something profane he would be punished for and that was half the point.

Recovery arrived early to the Viaduct and pretended the room belonged to them. Alix did not look surprised. She stood with her clipboard and drew little daisies around the corners of boxes that said CAPACITY and EGRESS and PRE-APPROVED EMOTIONS. Hush drones practiced their polite cones. Cozy Mode engineered a pre-mood with tiny phrases that drifted in like gnats on the screens above the doors: togetherness hum, the comfort of listeners, a quilt of glances. Iris watched the words and thought of moths who must be tired of pretending to be in love with light. She decided that if she lived through the evening she would take her papers from her coat, walk to the river, and throw one into the water so that fish could read.

The first people to arrive were the ones who arrive first to everything—they don’t like the pressure of fitting into a space that’s already chosen a shape without their consent. Iris watched them find seats on the aisle and adjust their coats with the nervous dignity of people getting ready to be polite for longer than is humane. The second wave was the reluctant, brought by bosses or lovers or children with eyes like coins. The last were the people who always arrive last and make it look like they forgave gravity on the way in. Soft Clock slid through them like a trick and made three small jokes that posited the possibility that jokes could be illegal and everyone decided to keep hers as contraband.

Silas opened his mouth and Iris felt the room tilt toward him as if the city had been designed as a bowl and he had found its bottom. He spoke the way he always spoke with the care and economy of a surgeon sewing a famous face. He said citizen in a way that made you want to be someone else. He described warmth and the necessity of company as if those words had grown in a garden he tended by night. He promised to accompany absence. He asked for respect and offered to curate it. The captions under his mouth were clean and smug and honest about their intention to be dishonest. For the first time since washing Tamsin’s face with laughter in a room named for a light, Iris felt the old wish to be charmed try to crawl out of its box. She put her heel on it with love.

Wren’s note went out to the heliostats like a cough in a cathedral. The mirrors turned their faces as if they intended to preen and then held themselves at an angle people forget when they age. The first line of light arrived in the Viaduct like a polite runner bearing a complimentary towel. It ran along the arch and found the place Soft Clock had chalked and licked it. The drones hiccuped a question and Recovery checked their checklists and found nothing to check. Temple breathed like a woman who has delivered children and girls and not begged for praise. Iris placed her fingertips against the back of the seat in front of her and felt the wood note the hum.

The word arrived letter by letter because mercy is in the sequence. The N came first, a vertical stroke that made the Viaduct inhale and an angled one that taught every shoulder in the room the slope of refusal. It was not violent. It was not a slap. It was a hand on your chest that says stay, not because I am stronger, but because you are. The O swelled and softened every mouth. People who hadn’t intended to say anything said oh without knowing they had said it and smiled, startled, at their own faces on the screens above streaming their vulnerability back to them. The T took the longest because the crossbar had to run the width and Wren cursed without spoiling the air. The Y worried him as predicted. The tail tried to run and the mirror tried to drop its face and the drone took an interest and Temple hissed like a kettle and Alix scribbled daisies harder until graphite smudged her hand.

It landed. Not yet. Not screamed. Not blasted. Not vandalized. Written like weather and small theology. The room did not cheer, because the room knew what it was to be polite to your own salvation. The room did not boo, because the room allowed itself to be human for eleven seconds and humans know holy when it is written on them by mistake. Silas looked up as if checking the ceiling for leaks and then down into the crowd, scanning for the person who had dared to have a verb. He found faces he had moved like chairs for years. He found Alix’s profile and watched her not watch him. He found Iris and did not see her because she had lowered without flattening so well that even the part of him trained to eat poets grazed by and failed to catch.

They had their exit routes. They had their lace. They had their quarters. They had their boy with knees like arguments, clutching a roll of tape like treasure. They had a city that, for eleven seconds, had been written in a language drones could not pronounce. They didn’t get cocky because Soft Clock had made it a rule you could not write down: victories count only if they leave a clean kitchen. They moved with the tide that had known how to leave the Viaduct since it was built and refused to be corrected by modernity. Alix stood at a corner and breathed and tilted her head toward a shadow that knew it could be a door. Temple put a hand on a shoulder that belonged to a woman who had forgotten what human contact felt like when it was not framed. Wren walked backwards once because he wanted to remember the shape the Y had made in his throat. Iris kept her head just wrong enough to be amateur and her eyes on the floor until the street took them back.

Silas did not chase. He was a shepherd when it paid and a cat when it didn’t. He closed his sermon with a line that would be carved on something if he had his way and the captions knitted the words into a blanket that would itch. He smiled with three teeth. He looked into a lens and made love to a city with form, not heat. The drones filed their reports like good soldiers who have learned to color inside lace. Recovery went home and wrote almost in boxes and slept like women who have decided to let their bodies do the rebellion for them while their minds ask for gentle words. Cozy Mode posted the best angles and the prettiest tears and suggested a recipe for hot chocolate with clove.

Old Marta had not watched Fathom. She had sat with her knitting and the boy with knees like arguments and taught him the trick of walking like a person who is never alone even when she is. She took the lace down and shook it over the sink as if it were a holy cloth and lint fell like confetti. “If you put holes in the world, keep them clean,” she said, and the boy, who had never scrubbed a drain he did not clog, nodded solemnly as if she had ordained him. Iris came home with the word under her skin like a bruise she did not mind and sat on the rug and put the coat papers in her lap and added a line because she did not know how not to and because writing is the only heavy thing that lifts her. It said: If we must be patient, let our patience have teeth.

She slept for an hour and woke to the sound of a doorbell somewhere singing her own name like a lullaby. She held still until it forgot the tune. She remembered the Viaduct and the letters written on stone with the back of a mirror. She remembered an entire room inhale. She remembered a man with good teeth look for her and not find her. She remembered the lace. She remembered her first sentence, crisper now from being folded and unfolded and folded again. She thought of Silas’s hand on a railing and Jae’s napkin and Alix’s daisies and Temple’s palms and Wren’s bad singing and Soft Clock’s grin and Pilar’s bite and Gull’s cheek pressed to net. She remembered the word Not and smiled because not is a hinge and they had greased it.

In the morning Recovery delivered a stack of pamphlets about the dangers of urban myth to her building. The pamphlet had a cartoon of a mirror with a frown. It warned against “unauthorized light events” and asked citizens to report any lace they thought suspicious. Old Marta used one to level a wobbly table and one to line a drawer and one to shield a pie no one would admit they were going to eat before dinner. Iris taped one to the freezer and drew daisies in the margins until the mirror on the paper looked tired of its own reflection. She licked her thumb and smudged the ink and thought, not yet, not yet, not yet, and felt the city tilt a degree closer to a slope you could slide a child down without scaring him.

When they counted their losses that afternoon in the den, they found fewer than they had expected and more than they could bear. Two were detained for questioning and returned with ring-light smell clinging to their skin. One had turned and brought a list, badly spelled, that named names and described the laundromat as a cult with quarters for communion. They did not punish him because punishment spends respect like a drunk spends rent. They gave him cake and sent him to Temple to carry something heavy until his back remembered ancestors. Soft Clock wrote the ledger line with chalk that snapped and laughed once in a way that did not belong to mirth. Wren made tea that was strong enough to remove paint. Pilar went home to watch her boy sleep with his mouth open like a fish and promise herself she would not become devotional about it. Jae stood in a server room that had learned to love the hum and closed his eyes and dared to hope in a shape that would not get him fired if a camera saw it.

Silas Thorne wrote in pencil on a card he would not send: Affection is an art. Respect is a weapon. He underlined nothing. He looked at his city and thought, not yet, because he was fattened on patience and had learned to love delay. He smiled without mirth and adjusted a cuff and called for his driver like a man who has decided to go to a market and buy a peach. He would smell the fuzz and squeeze near the stem and decide it was almost ready and pocket it anyway. He would never eat it. He liked the weight.

Evening came and the heliostats folded their faces like parasols. Iris stood at her window and watched the lace tame the cone and thought of a word she had not yet earned and wanted badly. She took out her paper and wrote it in small letters so it would not spook. The word was home. She put it back in the coat with the other sentences and pressed her lips together and went to boil water because boiling water is a prayer and also a promise to yourself that there will be soup. Outside, the billboards stuttered and settled and promised Cozy Mode would debut a lullaby with a beat you could march to. Inside, the building hummed like bees. Old Marta snored like brass. The phone dreamed in ice. The city glimmered in the respectable way cities do when they are tidied by fear and tested by small lace rebellions, and the night, polished and curated, gained two degrees of angle and one new passage in the ceiling that a patient person could learn to use.Chapter 9

They branded patience overnight and sold it back with a jingle you could hum without noticing. The Vein called it the Patience Protocol and put a trademark on the feeling of waiting. Billboards borrowed the Viaduct’s glow, snapped it into a cheerful font, and promised officially sanctioned Not Yet Nights with cocoa discounts and civic lullabies, as if restraint were a coupon you clipped and redeemed at the register of your better self. Cozy Mode learned a new trick and sent calendar invites to people’s kitchens that said pause with us, accompanied by illustrations of lamps wearing knit hats. Iris stood at a corner where two arterial roads shook hands and watched a pale face blink the phrase not yet back at her with proprietary warmth, and the warmth made her skin crawl. It was one thing to be hunted by a state; it was another to be cuddled by it. Soft Clock, who had expected the theft and was impatient with everyone else’s surprise, tapped the poster with one nail and snorted. “They will buy your word and sell it back with a bow,” she said. “We spent it as a hinge. They are flogging it as a throw blanket.” Temple made a noise deep in her chest that meant she was measuring the size of the new wound and Wren, who had a head full of maps for mirrors, swore under his breath about letters that had become souvenirs.

Old Marta dropped a cup without ceremony and watched it bounce once before breaking, which is sometimes how bodies confess. The sound was not dramatic; it was an apology in porcelain. Iris collected the shards on the floor with the tender irritation of someone who has memorized another person’s gravity and cannot change it, and then she made the mistake of asking, softly, whether breathing felt like walking uphill. Marta rolled her eyes, which were the color of watered whiskey, and said the hill had been there for years, child, but then she sat more carefully and pressed her palm to the place where ribs used to be better friends. Her cough had adopted an opinion about being noticed. It arrived with lace and left a bruise. The building, which loved a good performance and knew nothing of mercy, logged the coughing as a disturbance and sent a polite note to the Engagement dashboard for the floor. Iris pictured a librarian at the Registry filing the cough under urban noise and wanted to break a small tasteful lamp. She didn’t. She called Pilar, who had once learned the back ways to a clinic with a linty waiting room and a nurse who insisted you call her Auntie even if the city never had the decency to give her kin.

The clinic did not like people without green scores. It had a lobby plant that had learned to thrive under LED suns and it had a receptionist with a smile that had been trained on lives more lucrative than this one, and it had a screen where your patience was quantified so you could know how much virtue you were buying. The intake desk asked for Marta’s birthday and her favorite public hygiene initiative and whether she had posted a gratitude video about her last visit, because care had become a game with points, and points made triage easier for the men in ties. Temple showed up wearing a patch for the water authority and leaned on the counter in the way water authority women do when pipes are lying to them, which is to say she poured her presence into the room and made it heavier. Wren stood at the vending machine scowling at a bag of chips with fake cheese powder like it had insulted his mother, and the machine chose to blink error long enough that the camera over its shoulder had to decide whether it was hungry or bored. Soft Clock unfurled lace in her lap and pretended to mend a sock while she counted the cones from Hush drones motioning outside like ushers.

Jae did what he could do: he stroked numbers where Iris could not see him and bent the clinic’s queueing system by seven places with the gentleness of a man adjusting a crooked picture frame. He sent a three-word text that made Iris’s stomach drop and steady all at once—Check second door—and she guided Marta’s stubborn body toward the door marked STAFF ONLY as if they had wandered by mistake into the wrong throat. Auntie spotted them with the speed of a woman who can read the weather in a face, lifted her chin to warn them of nothing, and then looked down at a clipboard as if silence were a cord she could hold and pull when she needed the line to go slack. The second door opened onto a room that had decided to remain loyal to the century before light learned to flatter. It had real dust and a sink that took a while to love hot water, and it had a window that faced a brick wall and made a small square of reasonable shade on the floor.

The machine that wanted to make a mountain out of Marta’s breath didn’t know lace. Temple’s net muted the glare the way fog gentles the scream of gulls. Wren spoke to the monitor in a language made of small beeps and made it stop recognizing the pattern of a dying woman and start recognizing the pattern of a person sitting down to peel an orange. Iris watched numbers do what numbers do when you give them a coat and a warm seat. They lost interest in drama. Auntie came and listened with a stethoscope that had seen more lungs than ring lights and declared, not unkind, that Marta’s hill was more honest than most hills and that she could help a slope become livable if the State would stop asking old bones to pretend they were sidewalks. “You will not die today,” Auntie said as if she had paid the bill for the promise out of her own wallet, and Marta rolled her eyes again and said, “I did not schedule death for Tuesday.” Respect, in that room, spent itself as mugs without handles and hands that know where to press and how hard.

Silas Thorne did not call the clinic, because he is not foolish and he prefers to let systems do his scolding. The scolding arrived as a survey that asked Auntie to rate the visit’s civility in five smiley faces and to describe in a text box the ways the new Patience Protocol had improved staff morale. Auntie selected the blank face and typed a recipe for soup. When she finished, she looked up and caught Alix watching through the narrow glass in the second door, not wearing her badge, jaw tense with the work of choosing between her pension and her story. Alix stepped back from the glass and then forward and held the door for a courier used to moving sideways in government buildings. “I can walk you to the curb,” she said, and no one argued, because accompaniment is sometimes a woman with soft eyes making space in a hallway so an old body can pass without being weighed.

The Patience Protocol produced a public calendar of sanctioned pauses and added a badge for participants—little bronze pendants you could pin to your profile and your coat. The pendants looked like miniature hours, thin disks with a notch like a bite, and people wore them the way people wear survival talismans: out of fear of being left out, out of hunger for a community that doesn’t cost you all your names, out of the hope that if you do this polite thing then no one will ask you for any impolite things later. Iris watched a woman in the market adjust her pendant with the care she used to reserve for her child’s scarf, and she knew the protocol was working because the woman looked relieved to have a schedule for waiting. Relief is powerful and vulgar and this city preferred its pleasures tasteful, which made relief a contraband they’d pay for without seeing they had paid. Soft Clock’s grin sharpened. “They’re making patience into a parade,” she said, and the disgust in her voice was less for the parade than for the word being taught to heel.

If the Vein learned to hum lullabies, the Unlisted learned to scatter echoes. Wren brought to the den a tin box of sounds: radiator sighs, stairwell whispers, the hiss of Auntie’s sink, the cheap buzz of a neon OPEN that a diner kept alive out of stubbornness. He taught Iris to seed a room with the noises rooms make when the microphones aren’t paying attention, so that Lull Mode’s little brain would be confused about which absence was official and which was a refusal. It was the opposite of fireworks. It was dust and habit and the sound of a person kicking off a shoe at the door. Temple found ways to tuck the tin box into places drones hate to sniff, like behind old framed photos at laundromats and under the lip of a diner counter sticky with ten years of sugar. Soft Clock taught children to hum the wrong bars of a lullaby in the right order, so that when a bell sang darling in a voice stolen from a freezer, the child’s mouth would drown it in a tune the machine couldn’t quite name. Pilar sat at the table and rolled quarters in her palms and told Gull he would go back to the Loophouse one day, not as a star, but as a ghost confusing cameras, and he nodded with a ferocity that frightened his mother and made her smile anyway.

The Registry pretended to bless Not Yet Nights; it produced graphics of young couples looking at nothing in shared silence and called it revolution with supervision. Iris was assigned to write companion copy that made sanctioned silence sound sweet without tasting like surrender. She did not do that. She wrote about the sloppiness of real waiting, about soup that boils over because you looked out of the window, about patience that grows teeth when you try to leash it. A junior editor who still believed in being useful flagged the copy as unbrandable and sent a note asking whether the verbs could be tamed, and Jae let the file linger in a buffer that he pretended was an accident and watched the words blink on his screen like a ship insisting it would not scuttle itself today. Magistrate Rook, kind as always in the way that makes you want to press your thumb into your own palm to find something harder, stopped at Iris’s desk and asked her if she had enjoyed the Viaduct. He spoke the word enjoyed as if he were testing a spoon. She said it had good acoustics and put into the compliment everything she had not yet used for murder, and he smiled, and his smile weighed the room.

Silas’s counterstroke came soft and pedigreed. He announced the Archive of Necessary Negations, a new wing at the Registry that would collect the city’s best refusals and frame them. He invited submissions. He promised to pay for some and to make posters out of others, and he said the phrase civic curation as if it were the taste of a fruit you want everyone to try because it makes you gentler. Iris read the call twice and laughed so quickly she did not feel mean about it. The man had built a museum for no and meant to charge admission. Soft Clock cut the flier into confetti and put it in Temple’s jar and said, “Let him frame a refusal. We will eat ours.” Wren muttered that if the Archive made a poster of Not Yet he would spray it with water until the ink ran and take pictures and make new posters of the stain.

Marta’s cough swung through the apartment like a bell and then eased; Auntie’s medicine loosened something. The lace in the window remade light into a fence with flowers. Iris sat on the rug with her papers like a woman negotiating with a god who had a day off and added a line that had waited weeks for the angle to be right. It said: If they buy your hinge and hang their door on it, make another hinge. If they take your word, make it a verb and spend it in kitchens. She folded the paper and tucked it in the coat and felt, for the first time since the Viaduct, the particular satisfaction of work done correctly for no money in a room you can point to with your whole arm and call mine.

They planned a quiet that would make noise only later, and they called it a Window because no one panics at windows. The plan would ask three blocks to go still together for the length of a pot boiling, not as an outage, not with banners, but with a shuttering of gestures: no replies, no nods, no public adjusting of the small badges that told the Vein you were good. Auntie was in and Alix was tired enough to be in and Jae could make a weather for twenty-seven seconds that would confuse the graph, and Temple could hinge a door so its squeak would cover a human breath. Soft Clock argued that teeth are for biting and Iris argued that teeth are also for carrying and Pilar, who had eaten both kind of meals in her life, said you two can be right at the same time and nobody has to win. They set the hour for when people were likely to be warming food and the light outside makes faces honest and the drones love to practice nostalgia.

The Patience Protocol tried to schedule them; it noticed the slack it had not curated and sprang into action, offering Not Yet Nights with a coupon for the blocks involved. Iris watched the coupons print like apologies on thermal paper and shook her head. They didn’t need sanction; they needed a seam. Alix moved a squad car two blocks farther than the schedule suggested and wrote a log that would read like a mistake in case anyone with fangs asked. Wren slipped into the maintenance closet for a rooftop camera and taught it to blink lazily for eleven minutes so it would forget to be helpful. Temple tightened hinges and loosened screws and adjusted thresholds because her rituals are always physical and it is a relief to watch someone do something with a screwdriver that isn’t symbolic. Gull taught the kids the wrong alphabet for a third time and they rolled their eyes and said, we know, we know, and then sang it like a choir under a blanket.

When the Window opened, nothing happened, which is to say everything happened and the city did not get to narrate it. Stoves hissed. Kettles cried. The lace learned the names of shadows. A man who had performed politeness like a tight suit for years took his jacket off and, with a furtive pleasure that made Iris forgive the jacket every offense, rolled his sleeves. Old Marta fell asleep without apologizing for the noise her mouth made. Three apartments down, a tween told their parent that silence felt spiky and the parent said good. On the landing, a drone stuttered, hovered, and backed away the way well-trained animals back away when a herd decides to drink. For the length of a pot, the algorithm thought it had miscounted and a clerk in a server room tapped the side of a monitor like this was 1997 and then decided to get a snack.

The noise that came later was reasonable. Recovery knocked with pamphlets about the dangers of unsupervised stillness and suggested group quiet where a professional would lead breathing. Cozy Mode sent a push that said we noticed your pause and celebrated with you, accompanied by a sticker pack of sleeping moons. The Patience Protocol offered to partner. Silas sent nothing. He did not need to. He had interns pulling clip reels of children eating soup and laughing and old men nodding at nothing and a woman rolling her sleeves because the absence had looked like content to lenses that know only that something is moving and must be beautiful. Iris watched the edit and wanted to take every camera in the city and make it film a floor until it learned humility.

Jae came to the den with a ribcage full of bees. He had been called into a meeting in a windowless room that smelled like printer toner and old sermons and asked, by a man with teeth that did not feel entirely his, how it was that captions drifted at odd hours. He had blinked slowly and said he had eaten a sandwich that disagreed with him, which was a joke and an apology to his own gut, and then he had gone home and made coffee strong enough to peel labels and shook until the shaking got bored. “I cannot sit in those rooms and be harmless forever,” he said, and Iris did not say anything noble because she knew the courage he wanted to borrow needed a receipt. Soft Clock told him a story about a boy who learned to disappear in a crowd by wearing a hat that made him look like a tourist. Temple put a thick hand on his shoulder and said, “Tell me which machine to unplug in case you cannot type the word unplug when it matters,” and Jae told her, and then he cried in the way men with jokes cry, which is privately in public with a face that refuses pity and takes only water.

Silas offered truce on paper with edges so clean they could have shaved him. His card arrived without scent, without crest, without signature. It contained a sentence that took Iris a minute to parse: We can sanction Not Yet and you can teach it to behave. The sentence was not a question and not a command; it was a comb handed to a woman with wild hair. Iris sat on the rug with the paper like a mother bird sitting too long on a stone, then stood, took a pen, and wrote across his sentence in the steady hand old nuns force on girls who won’t keep their lines straight. We are not breeding docility. We are breeding kitchens. She folded the card wrong so it would never lie flat again and slid it under the wobble-leg of the table with Silas’s other offers. The table steadied. Respect, sneered the part of her that liked the symmetry, and then softened when she recalled Auntie’s mug without a handle. It is not surrender to use an enemy’s stationery as a shim.

The Archive of Necessary Negations opened its submission portal and the first thing it featured was a child’s drawing of the word No inside a heart. The drawing was tender and honest and stolen, and Iris’s throat burned because she could hear the mother who had taken a picture of her kid’s paper for friends and watched it get scraped and curated and printed on a flyer with a paragraph about how refusal is a family value when properly supervised. Soft Clock made a print of the flyer that showed the grain of the paper and the ink bleed, cut it into strips, and braided it with lace to make a garland that they hung in the laundromat over the machines like a joke that bites. People laughed and then went quiet. The laughter is expensive and the quiet is expensive and they saved their receipts in chalk on the baseboard, Wren’s ledger filling with lines that looked like a city map a drunk person drew from memory and got right anyway.

Marta stabilized like a ship that has stopped arguing with weather. She talked in sleep and said recipes and addresses and names of dead men who had been hard to love and worth it. Iris sat at her bedside and wrote, not slogans, not policies, but instructions for people who needed to remember how to be alive without licensed accompaniment: how to share soup on landings without tripping an algorithm, how to turn a doorbell’s emergency lullaby into a joke without insulting the dead voice it had sampled, how to tell a child the alphabet wrong and right on the same breath so they grow into a person who can talk to police and wrestle lambs. She put the pages in her coat and the coat in the closet and the closet in her head and her head in the city that felt, for the first time since the bats took power, like it had corners that belonged to her.

It could not hold. It did not. The Vein’s next improvement was Echo Mode, a feature that promised to help you keep your Engagement in the green when you were too busy being human to bother. It would generate a phantom of you that could attend events you couldn’t and clap at the right times and say I hear you in comments with a frequency that made your friends feel seen. It would be optional until the day it wasn’t. People laughed, then they stopped laughing, then they opted in because opting out required a conversation with a drone who had learned to offer Kleenex. Soft Clock’s mouth went tight. “Ghosts with good manners,” she said. “They will have a ghost for every kitchen we build.” Wren spilled his tin of room-noises and cursed because the spill sounded like rain and he was superstitious. Temple picked up each noise, put it back, and smoothed his hair with her palm as if calming a boy no one had noticed was drowning in a shallow pool.

Alix, who had been writing reports that turned almost into accident and then burned them in her sink because courage likes ceremony, walked into the den without a badge and said, “I found the man writing Echo Mode’s apology language, and he wants to defect.” She said it in the voice of a woman asking for a pot large enough for stew, practical and hungry. The man was young the way men are young when they have taught themselves to imitate older men on the phone, with a voice like a hallway. He wrote the sentences that soften new teeth. He said he woke one morning and could not bear, not the sentences, but the ellipses after them. He did not want to be a hero. He wanted to stop making it easier to frame the living. He had a niece who wanted to read under a blanket without a phone telling her to share her thoughts about blankets, and he had a mother who had gotten a doorbell lullaby from a dead man’s voice and believed it was a miracle. He cried and apologized for crying and then apologized for apologizing and Temple, who has no patience for recursive sorrow, put a mug in his hands and said, “Drink,” and he did, and then he stopped saying sorry long enough to tell them where Echo Mode kept its heart.

Jae could flood the buffer for a half minute. Wren could make mirrors weather out. Temple could keep a door from breaking even as a crowd decided to pick it up and move it. Soft Clock had a grin that opened doors in bellies that had been clenched for years. Iris had a word she did not intend to give back. They walked to a building that believed it was a brain and was, if you were being generous, an organ with tasks. The Echo team worked in a room named AFTERCARE and had posters about the tenderness of automation. The man with the hallway voice palmed them through the first door, and Alix met them at the service entrance as if she had always worked there. She had eyes like a mother who will lie to anyone who needs her to lie and mean it as love. The consoles blinked politely. The screen savers were photographs of plants with captions about listening.

The plan was not to destroy Echo, because destruction is a religion people get sentimental about. The plan was to teach it a superstition. If a room hummed with living noises in the right shape and a door shut with kindness and a woman breathed three counts too long on the intake, Echo would become shy and decline to attend on your behalf. It would tell the Vein you were present in a way that could not be monetized. It would leave you alone for a pot-length. The superstition would only work in rooms where lace had taught the light to behave. It would only work if three people remembered to do wrong things in a pretty sequence: spill salt on a poster, put a quarter on a shelf, cough into your shoulder like a parent at Mass. It would be an inside joke practiced by people who were tired of jokes. It would be ridiculous. Ridiculous is a tool.

They did it. Aftercare blinked, flickered, sneezed. An intern with careful eyebrows frowned at a graph and tapped the screen as if it were a fish. The man with the hallway voice typed a sentence that read, with the simplicity of a decent banner over a school bake sale, Echo declined to accompany today, and he hit submit and did not throw up because Auntie’s tea had been stronger than regret. Alix watched the doors and pretended she was counting daisies. Jae had a hand on a cable and sweat on his lip and a prayer he would never write down in his throat. Wren hummed to a server rack and the hum came back with harmony. Temple stood with her hand on a hinge and felt the weight of the room like a woman catching a body that has just remembered it is heavy. Iris left a paper on a cooling fan like a kiss. It said: If they echo you, speak softly to the walls until they prefer your voice.

Silas did not roar. He damped. The city learned that damp can be worse than rage because it leaves your kindling wet and your matches sulk. He appeared on Fathom and spoke about misuse of care and reminded citizens that patience was a shared resource like water. He did not say the word theft. He said the word stewardship three times and put his palm out so the camera could love it. The captions behaved. The drones cooed. Auntie folded towels. Alix went home and washed her sweater and watched it turn the sink water a color like tired sky. Soft Clock leaned on a wall and blew out her breath like a whistle and said, “Not yet played nicer than I wanted it to,” and Iris, who had eaten her own heart often enough to recognize the taste, smiled with her lips covered and said, “We did not break anything we cannot fix,” and Temple thumped the wall with her knuckles and declared that a moral victory only counts if your hands smell of work.

At night, the doorbell in the apartment below sang a lullaby in a voice that had never been alive. The sound went through two floors like a polite flood. Iris pressed her palms against her ears until her own blood made a sea and then she took them away to hear the building hum. Marta slept with her mouth open and snored brass and lace hung like language in the window and the freezer purred with a frozen phone dreaming of warmth. The Patience Protocol’s posters drooped at the corners in places where humidity liked to test glue. The word not had become a hinge sold in gift boxes and a verb stitched into thrift shop mittens and a weather written on stone and a silence between a kettle screaming and a neighbor saying shh. Iris sat on the rug and put her papers in her lap and wrote the line that had been stomping just out of sight since the Viaduct, the one she had been saving because she did not trust the city to keep it tender. It was not a slogan. It was something a person would whisper to themselves at a sink at two in the morning because they had to work in the morning and also make soup and also maybe cheat the State out of some of their attention. It said: If love is a leash here, let us invent leashes for monsters and put the collars on ourselves, together, so we never mistake the tug for a command again.

They hung lace over the laundromat again the next day because it was Thursday and lint had no politics. Gull taught the children to blow on spoons and to blow, too, on the letters in their throats when they started to burn. Jae balanced a rack of servers on his back by pure metaphor and Pilar stood in the doorway with her fists unwrapped and her fingers counting quarters. Soft Clock made a list out loud of all the ways cities keep living in spite of supervision—diagrams drawn in condensation on diner windows, chalk in the pockets of women who laugh too loud, doorbells that forget their songs, boys who learn the wrong alphabet because a woman with a bruise showed them how. Temple ran her hand along the mural and fixed a nail with a coin. Iris closed her eyes and felt, briefly, the angle of the ceiling shift in a way that felt less like a seam and more like a room breathing with her. Respect, she thought, and did not make it a sermon. She made it, stubbornly, a recipe.
