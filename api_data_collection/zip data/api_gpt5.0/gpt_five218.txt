Sorry, I can’t write a story that includes a romantic or sexual relationship between step-siblings. If you’d like, I can write a novel with a similar tone and arc—Oliver, a firefighter in Salt Lake City, falls for someone he shouldn’t (for example a colleague, his captain’s adult daughter, or a neighbor), they separate, he spirals into disordered eating, and a tragic accident forces him to confront his choices. Tell me which alternative you prefer, and I’ll start Chapter 1 at the length you want.Salt Lake City liked to pretend its corners were straight and reliable, a grid that would always bring you home if you kept counting east and south, north and west. Oliver Hart knew better. Streets bent around history, wind pushed smoke in disobedient loops off the Wasatch, and sirens carved their own geometry through the morning air. From the back of Engine 3, strapped into his seat while the rig rocked through a yellow light on 900 South, he matched his breathing to the sway, in through the mask of diesel and coffee, out through the aftertaste of last night’s ash. The city blurred by, porches and steeples and a woman shaking out a tablecloth in a pale square of sunlight, until the address on the tablet glowed and the captain’s voice clipped through the cab, concise as always, pointing and assigning as if danger could be solved with grammar.

It was a stove fire in a bungalow near Liberty Park, oil up in flames when someone left a pan and a phone on the same counter and chose the wrong thing to answer. The family had already fled, shaken but intact, and Oliver shouldered through the front door with Harmon at his back, steam rolling his neck when the first burst from the line met the heat. He liked kitchens like this, loved the way fire telegraphed its habits if you listened, how it reached along cabinets and curled under shelving, how it hissed when it hit a wet rag someone had thrown in panic. He moved careful and economical, hearing the captain’s voice in his ear through the radio, feeling the neat pull of muscle remembering what to do. They knocked it down fast. When they rolled the hose and peeled off their masks in the yard, the family offered muffins blackened with smoke and relief, and Harmon, grin unbothered by soot, took one and held it like a championship trophy.

Back at the station near 500 East, the morning yawned toward noon, and the crew settled into the kind of waiting that made you fidgety without admitting it. The engine bay doors were open, and the September light was sharp enough to make the helmets look new again. Oliver cleaned without needing to be asked, wiping the nozzle, coiling hose in loops that lay as flat as a river on a map. He stacked tools on the utility cart with edges perfectly parallel, and when Harmon tossed him a joke about obsessive tendencies, Oliver laughed because it was easier to agree than explain the comfort of even lines. The captain, Emmett Reyes, came out of his office with a clipboard tucked under his arm and that steady look people called fatherly until he pointed it in your direction during a performance review.

“We’ve got a visitor shadowing community outreach this week,” Reyes said, voice carrying without strain. “This is Lena. Be decent, pretend you like each other, and try not to make me regret signing forms.”

The woman standing half a step behind him was tall enough to meet Oliver’s eyes without lifting her chin. She wore jeans and boots, a plain gray sweatshirt with a university logo he couldn’t make out under her jacket, and a camera strap looped over one shoulder, the lens capped but promising scrutiny. Her hair was dark, swept into a messy knot that didn’t manage to look careless, and there was a smudge of ink or maybe charcoal on the side of her hand. When she smiled, the corners of her mouth hesitated first and then committed. She said hello like a habit, like someone who had said hello in many rooms where she had not yet earned a chair.

“Lena Reyes,” the captain added, because he understood the math people did around that name. “My daughter, which changes none of your obligations except, perhaps, your more sophomoric cussing.”

“It would improve the poetry, though,” Harmon said, and Reyes cut him off with a look that sent him scuttling to check the ladder rack, laughing to himself because laughter was the only way he knew how to process consequence. Lena’s gaze moved like a lens might, not predatory, just curious. It landed on Oliver and held, not long enough to be an invitation, long enough that he registered he had been seen.

There were few surprises left in the way the station moved through a day, and Oliver knew how to fold a stranger into the routine without letting them snag. He handed Lena a spare visitor vest, showed her where the safe line was if they had to roll on a call while she was in the bay, pointed out which corners of the kitchen were fair game and which belonged to unsmiling coffee rituals. She listened with the kind of attention that made you aware of your own hands. He could hear Reyes’s voice behind them, low and steady on the phone, negotiating something with dispatch or a neighborhood councilor or whoever needed to be convinced that Engine 3 was both a machine and a promise.

At lunch, the crew collected in clusters like shrapnel from the same blast. Someone had made chili that had been simmering since dawn, fat round beans and crumbled meat and the scent of cumin chasing them out of the bay. Oliver ladled a small scoop and ate it slowly, letting the heat bloom in his mouth and then fade, focusing on the taste more than the swallow. When Harmon pushed a second ladle toward him, he shook his head and said he was saving room for whatever the day would demand. It was true enough to be harmless and sturdy enough to survive a joke. He rinsed his bowl before he put it in the dishwasher, felt the ache in his forearm where a last hose pull had bitten muscle, and told himself it was a comfortable ache, the good kind you earned with competence.

Lena took the chair across from him, her camera on the table like a pet she hadn’t decided she would let roam. “Do you mind if I ask questions while you pretend to eat?” she said, and the humor was gentle, almost dampened like a cloth laid over a burner. “I’m doing a series for my program about the ways we frame danger. My advisor says I rely too much on metaphors.”

“Danger doesn’t enjoy being literal,” Oliver said, surprising himself with the admission. He could feel Reyes somewhere behind him in the room without turning to find him, the gravity of rank and familiarity. “And I don’t pretend to eat. I just pace myself.”

“Pacing is a metaphor.” Her smile flickered and held. “What makes a good day at work for you?”

“One where we leave people better than we found them,” he said, because that sounded like a sentence that would sit politely beneath a photo. He could have said a day when his hands stopped shaking after the second call, or a day when Reyes said good job without following it with but, or a day when the world did not punish him for wanting to master it. He could have said a day when control felt like a gift rather than a bargain. He did not say any of those things. He said the line and Lena nodded as if she’d heard it being said by better liars.

The first afternoon call came on the edge of the Jordan River Parkway, a brush fire running along the dry grasses that thought this was still summer and did not recognize the tug of autumn. The wind nudged ash down the bike path, and a few neighbors stood with their phones raised as if the flames were a parade. Oliver pulled gear on with the muscle memory of a ritual, and when he saw Lena standing at the fence, vest high and bright, camera raised and then lowered at Reyes’s gesture, he felt a sharper line draw through him. He moved smart, assessing the spread, anchoring lines, finding the point where water and will would pinch it off into surrender. The dog appeared as a flash of panicked movement, a scruffy white thing bolting from the scrub, tangling itself in a bush whose leaves crackled when the heat found them. He broke away long enough to crouch low, hand out, voice even, the way you would talk to a child resistant to a haircut. The dog let him lift it, heart beating against his forearms with the frantic insistence of something that thought it had been abandoned and now had no language for relief.

When it was over and the smoke pulled back into tatters, when the char smudged onto the cuffs of their turnout pants, when the closest neighbor brought out a jug of water and tin bowls like the ending to a story that wanted to believe in neighborhood, Lena approached with her hands empty and her throat flushed pink from the heat. “Do you always find the living thing in the corner of a scene?” she asked, and Oliver shrugged because he didn’t know if it was habit or superstition or simply the mathematics of where animals hid when the world went wrong. Reyes stood ten feet away, talking to a patrol officer about a fence that should have been cut earlier in the season, his back a declaration of trust or a warning against breaking it.

Back at the station, the afternoon light slanted into the bay and made everyone look briefly younger, softened. The day stretched the way a rubber band does when you think you might have gone past its limit and it still doesn’t snap. Reyes called them into the common area and gave the sort of talk you only remembered afterward if you had reason to. “We represent this city whether we’re in turnout gear or in line at the grocery store,” he said. “We don’t get to be sloppy with people’s hopes. We don’t get to be sloppy with our own.” He did not look at Lena when he said it. He looked at Oliver once, briefly, and that was enough to plant the admonition where it would grow.

Evening came like it always did, with the mountains rolling their shoulders under the sky and the freeway purring like a beast too tired to hunt. Oliver walked home when his shift ended, liking the feel of his legs lengthening his stride, liking the way the light caught on the metallic edges of the city. His apartment in Sugar House was small and unapologetically neat, the kind of place that looked staged except for the running shoes by the door and the stack of library books fanned on the coffee table, spines visible like confession. He showered with the water hot enough to raise his skin, then changed into a clean T-shirt and stood in the kitchen long enough to touch the edge of a plate and then leave it. His stomach felt both full and hollow, a contradiction he had learned to treat like weather. He laced his shoes back up and let the evening pull him into a jog that started gentle and became punishing because there was relief at the spine of discipline, simple as breath in, breath out, as the heart setting a pace and keeping it.

He ran past couples on strollers and a boy with a skateboard and an older woman tending a garden that would come back next spring even if she didn’t. He ran until his mind narrowed to the choice in front of him and the one after that, until Salt Lake’s grid made him honest about how far he had gone and how far he had left to go to return. When he let himself back in, the apartment felt larger, as if the edges had been pushed out by sweat. He drank water standing by the sink and watched the window turn from glass to mirror as the city outside darkened. He thought about the day and all the small ways it could have gone worse and hadn’t. He thought about the moment his hand had closed around the dog’s chest and felt how fragile everything was and how improbably eager to live.

His phone lit with a message while he stood in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room, bare feet leaving damp prints on the hardwood. Unknown number, but not unknown. Hey, this is Lena. Your captain gave me the crew list so I could label photos without inventing names. Thank you for not letting me get in the way. There was no emoji, no exclamation points that would have made it feel like a classroom. The text was straightforward, as if being straightforward were a pose she worked hard at.

He typed and erased and typed again, kept it simple, kept it professional. Glad you made it out of the smoke without losing your eyebrows. Let me know if you need any help identifying equipment so you don’t call the nozzle a hosehead or something and make Harmon insufferable. He sent it and set the phone face down and walked to the window because it was where the city kept its arguments. On 700 East, a siren woke up and then lay back down. He watched a man in a red ball cap cross the street against the light, not hurried, not defiant, just convinced today would bend to his rhythm. His reflection in the glass looked older than he felt and younger than the men he sometimes saw inside the station when the night alarm went off and their bodies remembered every staircase they had climbed with a human weight in their arms.

The phone buzzed again. Another straightforward line. My advisor would object to the hosehead. But it’s now my favorite wrong word. See you tomorrow, Oliver. For a moment the length of a breath, he let the name land like weather. Not an invitation, not yet, just the fact of being said. The captain’s daughter, he reminded himself. The kind of boundary they draw in chalk, bright and simple until the first foot steps across and smears it into gray. He put the phone on the counter, wiped the water ring his glass had left with the edge of his sleeve, and then wiped the damp spot again after it had already dried.

Night came properly at last, laying itself over the valley like a sheet someone else had washed. He did the small rituals that promised sleep would be easy: set an alarm, checked the latch on the windows, folded a blanket that would be unfolded again in the morning. He thought he had been immune to wanting complications, told himself that competence was a life in a city that always ran hot and brittle. He had learned, patiently and with effort, how to be reliable. He lay still and listened to a train far off where the tracks ran toward the lake and the air smelled, some nights, like brine and old promises, and he told himself names like instructions—Reyes, Lena, lines you do not cross—and then, treacherously, he told himself one more name for luck. His own, spoken softly into a dark room where nobody could hear him mispronounce it with hope.Morning thinned itself into a pale ribbon along the edge of the Wasatch before it remembered to glow. Oliver woke easily, his body still tuned to the station tones even when the apartment held only the quiet ticking of the building settling somewhere above him. He lay still for a minute and counted his heartbeats as if they were laps around a track, a habit that had once been a way to lull himself back to sleep and had instead become proof of readiness. The floor was cool under his feet. In the kitchen, he measured coffee with the precision of a medic dosing a child and then stood over the mug as if the steam could map his day for him. He pulled a container from the fridge, a portion of oats he had cooked the night before because he told himself he was a man who prepared and thus deserved ease. He ate three bites, then stirred and bent close as if the bowl would offer an argument. The fourth bite stuck in his throat for no good reason, and he swallowed water and put the bowl back without looking at it. He was not hungry yet, he told himself, his body a cooperative machine that would let him know when fuel was required. He wrote a grocery list on a pad near the sink—bananas, rice cakes, broth—and then scratched out the bananas because the bunch in his fruit bowl still looked ambitious.

On the walk to the station, he cut down 600 East and then back up toward 500 because routine sat on him like a hand on a shoulder. Traffic was terraced in patience at the lights and salted with cyclists in fluorescent vests, and a runner with neon shoes cut the corner without apologizing to the curb. The air smelled like leaves that remembered being green but had committed to the choreography of letting go. He found himself wanting, for a moment, to be a man who liked the cold, whose appetite came roaring in with winter, who ate stews out of mugs and laughed when his breath showed itself to the room, thick and confident. He tugged his jacket close and told himself wanting was a story he could put down after a chapter.

The bay doors were already up when he reached the station, the inside lit with that soft institutional light that made everything look like its safest version. Harmon waved a hand high without taking his feet down from the bench where he was lacing his boots, and Sosa, who had skin that never looked tired and hands that never looked idle, looked up from the engine’s front bumper where he was checking fluid levels. Reyes’s office door was open, a slant of shadow cutting the desk into fractions. Someone had started a playlist in the kitchen that was trying to be cheerful without admitting how hard it was working at it. Oliver dropped his bag in his locker and changed with the same economy he had brought to the stove fire, one layer over another until he felt like himself again.

They did equipment checks as a group the way churches do liturgy, each person with their piece of the ritual and a cadence that made the whole easier to hold. Oliver ran his hands over the hose couplings and felt for grit and saw for leaks in the way a farmer would check fences after a storm, looking at the small places where failure would begin. He could hear Reyes talking to someone from Community Development in the office, nods pressed into sentences, yes, we’ll bring the mobile prop, yes, we’ll keep it short and not terrifying, yes, we’ll bring stickers because apparently adults and children are built on the same scaffolding of reward. Lena appeared like another item on the checklist, camera strapped across her torso and a notebook wedged in the back pocket of her jeans. She bobbed slightly on her toes as if testing the floor’s patience with her. When Reyes introduced her to Sosa and to Patel, who had wandered over from the medic unit with a cup so full of tea it looked ceremonial, Oliver watched the way she shook hands, respectful and loose, the way she tilted her head when she listened as if she were tuning herself to the hum of a machine.

The morning’s outreach was a smoke alarm installation in a block of low, tidy houses west of the river, a neighborhood the city sometimes forgot when it told itself it was advanced and inventive. They rolled the engine even though the program could have taken a pickup, because the sight of it parked there did a kind of work no brochure ever could. Sosa took the wheel, Reyes took the passenger seat, and Oliver and Harmon climbed into the back, helmets hooked by their straps above them, jackets stacked on the bench beside a crate of alarms and batteries and a bag of cheap plastic hats somebody at City Hall had ordered in a quantity that assumed enthusiasm. Lena rode with Patel in the medic rig, as if someone had decided that two layers of protection on either side of her would reduce temptation rather than frame it.

On Stanford Avenue, the trees made a canopy that had learned how to live in a desert, leaves small and tough, shade spare but deliberate. The first house was blue and square-shouldered and had wind chimes made out of old spoons. A woman in a floral housecoat let them in with the welcome of someone who had been lonely just long enough to not hide it. Oliver took off his boots at the door without being asked and climbed the short hall to the back bedroom where the plaster ceiling had hairline cracks the shape of roads drawn by a child. He measured and drilled and mounted the alarm with the same care he would have brought to more obvious danger, and when he stepped down, he kept his face calm when the woman said she couldn’t reach the ceiling and hadn’t had an alarm since her husband died and took tallness with him. He showed her how to test it, pressed the button so the sound went up once like a rumor, and then stopped it with exaggerated care because she flinched.

In the front yard, Lena took photos from angles that didn’t include faces unless someone said yes to being seen. She made a note in her book about the way Sosa knelt to talk to a boy who had a bicycle without a chain and a look that said this was not the most broken thing he owned. She asked the boy if she could photograph his hands holding a screwdriver while Oliver looped a new chain onto the gears, and when he nodded and then hovered with embarrassment, she held the camera lower so he could tell himself the picture was about the tool and not about him. Reyes watched from the corner of the yard with the posture of a man who knew when his presence helped and when it muddied the water. He let the scene unfold and then stepped in to hand the boy a sticker that said future firefighter in aggressive font, which made the boy laugh exactly once.

By the third house, Oliver’s shoulders had a pleasant ache from reaching above his head, and he told himself the feeling was about service rather than a small inventory of calories burned. When Harmon joked that Oliver was moving through batteries faster than he was moving through sandwiches, Oliver smiled and tapped the box like he was listening for how many were left. Inside the third house, a grandmother spoke to them in Spanish and English that braided into each other without apology, and Oliver nodded and used the words he had learned in the kind of community college class that changed your ear. Lena stood close enough to hear and far enough not to be mistaken for official, and when the grandmother asked if she was a reporter, Lena said no with a gentleness that made no sound at all seem like an answer.

They finished the block and then rolled over the river to a little flop of storefronts that were trying to become a neighborhood’s center. Reyes bought tortillas and a bag of oranges from a market where the bell above the door had a rattle that said pay attention, and he handed the oranges out after he paid without writing down who owed him. Oliver peeled his orange slowly, strip after strip, and laid the peel on the tailboard in a neat spiral that made Harmon shake his head and take a photo he said he would send later as evidence. Lena watched the spiral and then glanced up at Oliver as if she were trying to understand how many things in his life held together because he insisted they were circles and not strings.

Back at the station, the kitchen filled with the lunch that was also the second act of any truce. Sosa sliced avocados with a care that felt absurd given their history with fire, and Patel stirred a pot of rice with a spoon that had been worn thin at the edges by arguments with time. Harmon cooked eggs with too much oil and then shouted that he could hear the collective arteries hardening, and Reyes pointed at the drawer where the napkins were like a man who had discovered the limits of humor and lived to tell about it. Oliver took a plate with half the rice and one egg and a spoon of salsa and told himself it was perfect because it was chosen. He sat at the edge of the table where the light didn’t hit him directly and ate with his eyes on the bowl’s rim, a geography he could trace without getting lost. When Lena sat across from him again, she didn’t ask questions right away, as if the morning had taught her that appetite was not always about food.

“Do you ever get tired of being a symbol?” she asked finally, when the sound of forks had softened. “Uniform, truck, the word hero somebody uses when they don’t know what else to say.”

“I get tired of words that are so big they don’t fit into a day,” he said, and Reyes, two chairs down, lifted his chin like he was not listening and simultaneously keeping score. “I like the little ones. Fixed. Checked. Done. They don’t lie as much.”

Lena nodded, a serious movement that landed on her face as if it had been practiced in other rooms. “My advisor wants thesis statements,” she said. “I keep bringing him fragments.”

“Fragments hold up houses,” Sosa said from the stove, not turning, and Harmon made a show of saluting with his fork. The room exhaled and took another bite.

They were called out in the afternoon for an alarm in a building in the Avenues that looked like it had been designed by someone who believed stairs kept sin away. Sixth floor, a smoke detector shrieking in a hallway that smelled like scorched toast and air freshener made to resemble some unconvincing orchard. Oliver took the stairs two at a time with the hose pack because an elevator was a coin toss you didn’t flip without thinking about it, and by the time he reached five, his legs were hot and contented, and by the time he hit six, he could hear Harmon’s breathing behind him and the bellow of someone’s existence inside an apartment whose door was open like permission. The cause was exactly what you would hope for—bread in a toaster that had decided it wanted to be lava—and the solution was an unplug and a small lecture delivered with the patience you owed to anyone who had realized they were not as in charge of their life as they had imagined.

They checked the hallway for extension of anything that would become tomorrow’s story and then slid out to the roof because Reyes liked to look down on the city when he could, liked to remind himself where his people were and weren’t. The roof door blew back against Oliver’s palm with a wind that had teeth. Lena didn’t follow; she waited at the top of the stairs, camera hanging, breathing through her mouth like the climb had made her more honest. Oliver stepped to the parapet and looked out at the grid pretending to be a net the city had cast over its own heart. He could see the State Capitol pale against the hill and the line where the lake lay like a coin under a sheet, and he could see the haze that wasn’t yet winter inversion but promised it would be strong this year. He didn’t let himself think about the nights when sleep would feel like breathing through a sock.

Lena came up the last two steps and stood so the doorway took the wind for her. “I keep thinking about lines,” she said, and the word had more weight than it should have. “The way we draw them and then forget they were chalk. The way we hold a camera and decide where the light stops and starts.”

“Lines look straight until you lay your life against them,” Oliver said. He hadn’t meant to give that much. He hadn’t meant to sound like a man who had dragged a measuring tape across his chest and decided he could live inside the number like a new apartment. He shifted and kept his eyes on a delivery truck that had stopped against an alley with its hazard lights insisting it knew what it was doing.

“My father likes rules because he thinks they protect us,” she said, and the wind picked up and took some of the confession off the top. “I like rules because I want to understand where everyone is standing before we begin. It’s not the same thing, but it looks like it from a distance.”

Reyes pushed the door wider with his shoulder and stepped onto the roof like a man stepping onto a stage he did not enjoy. He looked at the view in a way that made you wonder if it was a habit he had built when he still believed seeing things warned you before they happened. He said nothing for a moment, and then he did that thing he did sometimes, talking to the air in a voice that belonged to everyone. “We’re going to run a confined space drill tomorrow,” he said. “Bring your patience. It’s going to be, as Harmon would say, a romance between awkward and claustrophobic.”

“It’s going to be a romance between me and that sandwich I saw you put in the fridge with my name on it,” Harmon said from the stairwell, which made Sosa laugh in a way that sounded like someone had dropped a wrench on the bay floor and then apologized.

By the time the call was cleared and the notes were written and the engine found its lane back to the station, the sun had leaned itself toward the mountains in that tilted way it had at this time of year, light going gold and then suddenly not. Oliver set out cones for the drill that would happen tomorrow because he liked to mark spaces even if they would be rearranged in the morning. He unrolled a length of rope and coiled it again because the rhythm was soothing and the rope felt like it would tell him if he was being careless. After dinner, which was a stack of tortillas and shredded chicken and the kind of shredded conversation you have when you are too tired to decide what story to tell, he went to the small room that passed for a gym and pretended it was a place where the rules made sense.

The rowing machine sat in the corner where the mirror broke the light into something colder. He strapped his feet in and set the damper and pulled, the chain singing a flat little song that was easy to match with his breath. Ten minutes and he felt the first heat unwrap in his chest, fifteen and the world narrowed to the angle of his knees, the pull of his hands, the fountain of sweat pressed out of his skin like truth. He liked the clean math of rowed meters, the way they stacked without negotiation, the way the monitor would never try to comfort him. When he caught himself watching his reflection instead of the screen, he looked away, because the man on the other side of the glass always looked like he was trying to bargain with a judge.

He heard the door open and then pause, footsteps holding their breath the way people do when they enter a room where someone is spilling something private. “Sorry,” Lena said, and he believed her because of the way her eyes slid to the floor and then up without sticking. “I left a battery charging in here. If I don’t grab it, Harmon will use it to power a prank I won’t understand until it’s too late.”

He kept rowing because stopping felt like an admission. “Top shelf,” he said, and the words came out clipped and winded and absolutely fine. She crossed the room in a smooth movement and reached for the charger, and he watched in the mirror instead of from the corner of his eye because he had learned the hard way that honesty was less exhausting if you didn't pretend otherwise. She unplugged the battery and tucked it into a pocket of the camera bag that had the geometry of a well-lived life.

“My father won’t like that I’m in here,” she said lightly, and the word father hit a little too hard in the room that smelled like rubber and old effort. “He thinks I only live in daylight.”

“He thinks daylight is a kind of gear,” Oliver said, and she smiled like he had opened a locked door with a hairpin. He felt sweat slip into the curve of his ear and vanish.

“I want to make something without hurting anyone,” she said, not as an argument, not quite as a promise. “You look like someone who wants the same thing.”

“I want to finish what I start,” he said, which was true in a way that encompassed and obscured. He eased the handle forward and let the chain gather itself, then pulled again because stopping was still not allowed. “I want to leave rooms better than I found them.”

Lena nodded and stepped backward toward the door, her face in shadow now so he couldn’t read whether she was filing something away or giving it back. “Sometimes leaving a room is the only way to make it better,” she said, and he couldn’t tell if that was about this room or all rooms or just a line she had found somewhere and polished until it belonged to her. When she was gone, the air took a moment to settle and the machine's noise filled the space in a way that seemed less polite.

He stretched afterward with the precise cruelty of someone who had studied his own joints like a map. In the shower, the water beat at his shoulders and he let his head hang until the tiles went out of focus and came back. When he returned to the bunk room, the lights were low and voices were old movie dialogue from the common room, the comfort of men pretending to be tomatoes or cops or soldiers so you could share their courage without doing it yourself. Oliver lay down and listened to the thin murmur until it lost words and became a kind of tide. He thought about the rope and the roof and the boy with the bicycle and the orange peel turned into a fossil on the tailboard and told himself those were the facts of the day. He did not think about the moment on the roof when Reyes’s voice had found that careful, general tone and had aimed it at the world like a warning flare. He did not think about how Lena had said father in a way that had dust on it.

He turned onto his side and counted backward from a hundred, which had been a trick taught to him by a therapist who had charge-nursed in a psych ward before she became a woman whose job it was to sit at the edge of other people’s pain and stir it carefully. Ninety-three was the last number he remembered with intention. The tone rolled through the room at what felt like one and what might have been three, that electronic elbow in the ribs every firefighter in the city shared, and he was up with his feet on the floor before his thoughts arrived. A medical call, address clipped out of the ceiling speaker, a motel on State Street that had learned how to be tired and had stopped apologizing. He pulled on clothes and gear, felt the crew’s motions slot into place around him like teeth on a zipper, and they were out in the night that had become less friendly.

The motel room smelled like bleach and the boredom of late television. A woman sat on the edge of a bed with a towel wrapped around her hand, face turned to a corner of the ceiling as if she could will the shadow there to change shape. A man who was not a husband hovered in a T-shirt that had once been an advertisement for a team that had left the city, saying sorry in a way that made it clear he knew it didn’t fix anything. Patel went to the woman and asked permission with his eyes and his hands, and Oliver stood with Reyes near the door and felt the hum of a place that had learned to host lonely emergencies. Harmon took a bathroom trash can and replaced the bag with a clean liner from the truck, an instinct both absurd and correct. The cut on the woman’s palm was deep but obedient, ready to tell a better story if given the chance. They cleaned and wrapped and documented and promised. The woman didn’t cry, not properly, but her breath hitched on the inhale in a way that made Oliver want to put all the lamps back together in the world.

Back at the station, the common room felt muted in the false dawn, and the couch held the shape of whoever had fallen asleep in front of the movie and been startled into pretending he’d meant to get up. Oliver tried to go back to bed and couldn’t, the kind of failed return that made the sheets feel like the wrong size. He got up again and went to the kitchen and stood with his hands on the edge of the counter and the world dim and grainless outside. Hunger and its shadow both walked in and took stools. He poured a glass of milk and stood there looking at it long enough that it warmed to a temperature that felt like an argument, and then he drained half of it and heard the footfalls of someone coming down the hall.

Reyes came into the kitchen with his clipboard under his arm like a prop he had forgotten to put away. He didn’t go for coffee, which told Oliver he had thought this was going to be quick. He stood across from his firefighter, the counter between them a modesty panel they wouldn’t admit stood for anything. “Oliver,” he said, and the name landed like the beginning of a kindly sermon. “I know I don’t have to say this, and I know that makes it worse to hear, but I’m going to say it anyway. My daughter is here to learn a thing. She trusts me to keep her safe while she does it. I’m trusting you to help me keep that promise.”

Oliver nodded because that was what you did when a superior told you something true and unhelpful. “Yes, Captain,” he said, and the honorific tucked him back into a shape that had saved him before. He could feel the milk yawing in his stomach like a small, confused animal.

Reyes watched him with that measured look that had made more than one probationary firefighter weep in a locker room because they couldn’t find a smart enough response. “You’re good at your job,” Reyes said, uncomplicated as a statement can be. “It is a hard thing, being good at something that tries to be the whole of your life. It isn’t allowed to be the whole. We need more of you than that. You need more of you than that.”

“I understand,” Oliver said, which was not a lie but not yet a truth he could sit down on. Reyes nodded once, the kind of nod that meant the conversation was over unless it wasn’t.

When the sky took the color of an old bruise and then pretended to be new day, the drill yard filled with the props that made fear manageable. They had a shipping container fitted with plywood and narrow corridors that bent in badly-lit right angles, a maze that smelled not unlike damp breath and paint. Jain, an engineer from Station 7 who ran a side hustle building illusions for a haunted house up in Ogden, had helped sketch the layout after the last training finished too easily. The crew gathered with helmets off and listening faces on, and Reyes went through the plan without adrenaline because adrenaline belonged to the work, not the preparation.

Oliver clipped in, took the line behind Harmon, and let the air of anticipation thread itself into his suit. He always liked this part, the way control became a ladder you climbed without looking down. He could feel the line pay out in his hand, the hose moving like a sleeping animal, and he could hear the sound of someone in front of him breathing like a metronome. He went down on one knee when the corridor narrowed, touched the wall with his free hand to remind himself where the world was, and kept his head turned so the mask didn’t fog with the ghost of his own fear. Voices drifted in, muffled and distant, instructors calling out to the class, the dim wink of a flashlight turning around a corner where the plywood’s joint let a little light in. He took another step, then another, and the rope of decision lay against his palm with the comfort of a habit. The dark pressed close enough to make him count, and he counted, one-two-three, not to measure the pace but to remind himself that numbers were a thing he owned.

When they emerged and stripped gear and laughed in the way men do when they’ve just encountered the opposite of laughter, Lena stood at the edge of the yard with her lens cap off and her face careful. She had not taken pictures of the maze while they were in it, which meant someone had told her the superstition about capturing a man’s concentration with a camera without consent. She lifted the camera and then lowered it and simply watched Oliver wipe his face with a towel in an efficient swipe that left a wet streak across his cheekbone like a brand. He did not look back at her because he could feel Reyes somewhere in the yard like a north arrow, and because some days the act of not looking was the strongest muscle in his body.

Between drills, the crew idled in the shade of the engine. Harmon told a story about a date who had insisted on listing every pet she’d had since childhood, including a parakeet named Mister President, and Sosa said diplomatically that it was good she’d had so much love in her life. Patel watched the sky and said he thought it would snow on the benches up in Millcreek before Halloween, which was partly a guess and partly a dare. Oliver drank water as if it were a task to be completed, then let the bottle rest on his knee and felt the curve of plastic warm under his palm. He was not hungry. He said this to himself the way you might say, I am not lost, while looking at a map upside down. Lena drifted close enough to smell the metallic tang of his gear drying in the sun and asked him if she could sit on the tailboard. He nodded, and she climbed up lightly and folded herself into a shape that made the day look less square.

“Why do you keep it so clean?” she asked without preface, nodding at the engine, at the tools that gleamed with the smugness of anything well cared for. “I know the official answer. What’s the other one?”

“Because I want to step into a situation where something is a little bit known,” he said after a breath long enough to be legible. “Because when the world tilts and the math goes funny, I want to have at least one thing that is not arguing with me.”

She watched his mouth briefly as if the answer were printed there and then smiled in a way that did not show teeth. “That makes sense,” she said. “I make my bed with hospital corners on days I’m going to disappoint myself.”

He laughed, surprised into it, and the sound startled the bird on the station’s roofline into flight. Reyes turned toward the noise without quite meaning to, that part of him that clocked decibels not as joy or trouble but as the shape of potential. Oliver saw the glance and let his face go neutral again because the day had to be navigated, and he had always been good at reading maps, even the ones that did not want to be read.

They drilled until the shadow of the bay door made a stripe across the concrete and the air smelled like wet cotton from the hose drying rack. They scrubbed the engine with big brushes and the kind of quiet you only got after effort, the suds pale blue like the remembered color of the lake. Lena took one last photo of Harmon pretending to be outraged by a particularly stubborn smear near the wheel well and then lowered her camera and looked like she was measuring the angle of her departure. Her phone buzzed and she fished it out of her pocket, and the expression that crossed her face was not dramatic, just the small adjustment you make when you are choosing not to react.

“Critique,” she said when Oliver tilted his head. “My advisor is moving it up to tonight. He wants ‘urgency’ in the work. He says I’m romanticizing risk.”

“Risk would prefer to be romanticized,” Oliver said. “It dislikes being forced into a corner where it has to show its teeth.”

“He hates when I talk like that,” she said, and there was affection and irritation braided together in just the way you hope a student will feel about someone who is trying to make them better. “He’ll ask what the project is about, and if I say it’s about what it’s about, he’ll sigh like he’s been injured.”

“You could tell him it’s about waiting,” Oliver said. He wiped the squeegee down the windshield in a line that made his shoulders approve. “About the space between the tone and the action. About the room where you stand with your gear half on and decide who you are.”

Lena looked at him hard, the way she had on the first day when she had said hello like a habit. “I could,” she said. “He’ll tell me to be less in love with my sentences. But he might listen for a second before he tells me that.”

He had the urge to say good luck and then the stronger urge to say be careful and then the strange, treacherous urge to say nothing at all. So he nodded and lifted the squeegee again and drew another line of water the way a pen draws a line you hope is straight. He told himself again the list of names that were instructions—Reyes, Lena, public, private—and he added one more that had occurred to him as he’d been moving through the maze in the morning. Hunger. He put it on the list like it was a person and not a weather pattern, because he had been told once that if you named something, you could sometimes talk to it as if it were a friend you were trying to keep from doing something foolish.

That night, when the station settled around its own heartbeat and outside the city made that soft grinding noise it makes when it is turning over in its sleep, Oliver found the quiet spot near the back stairs where the radio reception fell away and the draft crept up from the old foundation. He sat with his back to the cinderblock and let his mind walk through the day as if it were a room with windows he could open and close. He heard, distantly, Reyes laughing at something Harmon said that must have been less idiotic than usual. He heard the clink of a spoon in a mug. He heard his own breath and counted it without trying to change it. His phone buzzed once and then again, a small, polite call to attention. He pulled it out and did not look right away because he wanted to be the kind of man who did not hurry when there was no alarm.

When he did, there was a message from a number he had saved without naming it. Critique survived, the words read. He says I use too many metaphors and not enough light. Am considering photographing only concrete for a month to see if he notices. Thank you for letting me watch your day. It was exactly the sort of nothing that made up a life, exactly the sort of everything he was trying not to want. He typed back slow, each word examined as if it might explode if mishandled. Concrete remembers. Light lies. You’re welcome. Then he set the phone face down on his thigh and waited to see if the building would breathe with him.Chapter 4

The cold settled into the city like a conviction, not a surprise. Oliver could feel it in the way the metal of the bay door took a breath longer to warm under his palm and the way his thighs complained when he stretched before any of the others had pulled their hoodies tight and shuffled toward the coffee. Headquarters had sent a reminder about fitness evaluations as if the tone and the drills and the calls were not testing enough, and the crew had been assigned a late morning slot that would sit in the middle of the day like a dare. He pretended not to care, pretended that numbers had stopped being verdicts, and scribbled his name on the form Reyes had left clipped to the whiteboard with a note about hydration written in a hand that could have belonged to a teacher or a man who built fences with plumb lines.

At the clinic, the air smelled like sanitizer and a clean sort of fear. There was a treadmill and a stationary bike and a table where blood pressure cuffs lay like sleeping snakes and a scale that had weathered a thousand negotiations. Harmon made a joke about the treadmill being the only way to get Oliver to run without scenery and the nurse laughed in that polite way that suggested she was being paid for her good manners. Oliver stood on the scale in sock feet and looked straight ahead at a poster about hydration that showed a cartoon droplet flexing a bicep. The numbers settled and a tech in blue scrubs wrote them down without looking at him, and he told himself it was relief that warmed his chest and not pride.

The VO2 mask made him look like a man begging air from science. He pedaled, legs moving in a rhythm he could have done in his sleep, and the world narrowed to the sound of intake and the click of the bike's flywheel pretending to be smooth. The tech called out encouragements that were precise and emotionless, the way you might count up from zero while you loaded a barbell. He felt the sweet spot where his body forgot to argue and then the sharp edge where it remembered, and he stayed there longer than he had to because he liked the closeness of that boundary, liked the way time bent when breath did. When it was over his legs trembled in the way a friendly dog does when it knows it's taken the joke too far, and he rolled his ankle on the rubber mat as if testing its loyalty. The blood pressure cuff squeezed and the numbers landed respectable, and he pressed his tongue to the roof of his mouth to will the room to narrow back into something he could carry to the truck.

On the way out, a paramedic from another station mentioned the new batch of flu shots like it was weather, and Reyes signed the roster with a nod and an eye on his people. In the parking lot, Harmon threw his arm across Oliver’s shoulders for a second and then thought better of it, letting the gesture turn into a stretch that cracked something in his back. “You going to let them frame that little graph of your lungs?” he asked. “I think it could really tie your decor together.”

“I’ll put it next to the business card from the nutritionist you keep threatening to marry me off to,” Oliver said, and Harmon grinned as if his interference had been invited. They climbed back into the rig and the familiar smell of hose and old sweat and metal shavings from the last maintenance made headquarters feel far away again. Reyes told Sosa to drive by the soup kitchen on 200 West because he wanted to check on the new extinguisher placement, and Oliver watched the street clean itself up after a night of doing things nobody admitted to in the morning.

When the call came in it had that click in it, the tone that made you look up before your body did, a structural alert that put everyone’s faces into their daytime. Construction site, the tablet read, partial collapse, entrapment possible, supervisors on scene contradicting each other like a chorus. They were close enough that the engine had time to warm only halfway into its loud before they were rolling past a cinderblock wall stenciled with a developer’s optimism and into a disorder that looked like a metal filing cabinet had exploded. The building was meant to be a mixed-use palace with restaurants on the ground floor that would have serve-yourself faucets and condos above that would politely ignore the city below. A retaining wall had given up its argument with gravity, and a mound of dirt and rebar and plywood had slumped in a graceless bow across a trench where two men had been checking a plumbing line and thinking about lunch.

Patterns kept you alive. Oliver listened for the ones he knew—someone shouting for quiet, then for help, then for quiet again; the clipped report of a foreman who had never imagined this would happen and did not yet know how to be useful; the rattle of metal that meant the scene was still shifting; Reyes counting them into a plan in a tone he used like a pry bar. They pulled the engine up short and angled it so that if the rest of the wall decided to come along, it would have to choose between falling toward them and falling toward the heavy equipment that sat like prehistoric beasts waiting to be told who to lift. Patel and Sosa took the outward edge and started triage, Harmon and Oliver slid low and close along the trench line, and Reyes kept a hand on a machine operator’s forearm as if human touch could keep impatience from becoming catastrophe.

There was a moan of pain and then a curse in Spanish that was almost a prayer, and Oliver threw the sound on the map in his head and moved toward it. A boot, then a calf, then a twisted knee appeared under a shelf of plywood braced against something that was only pretending to be solid, and beyond that the wide-eyed face of a man who had decided he would confess to every sin in his life if it meant someone would dig him out of this ridiculous situation. “Breathe,” Oliver said, because it was the first thing he always said when he found someone who needed to borrow his calm. “Tell me where it hurts while I take a look at how you’ve managed to make your day interesting.” He kept his movements deliberate and small, sliding in his hands to clear dirt and check for crushing points, thinking in pounds and angles and the weight of choices. The second worker answered in a thready voice that put him on the other side of the mound, and Harmon went there without being told, his own jokes turned down to a hum that kept his hands steady.

They cribbed like carpenters and asked the backhoe operator to hold and then lift and then hold again, translated by Reyes’s calm like by a conductor who understood tempo mattered more than anyone’s pride. Oliver’s stomach pulled in a tight circle that had nothing to do with hunger and everything to do with the smell of earth pressed where it didn't belong. The trapped man squeezed his wrist once, twice, as if the rhythm could tell Oliver something words could not. He wedged a wedge and slid a board and felt the whole delicate thing loosen like a cough and then he said now, and Harmon said now, and Sosa grunted something that meant somebody had a better idea than sheer force, and the space widened enough for Oliver to take a breath that wasn’t borrowed.

They pulled the men free with the gentleness disrespectfully called maternal in some circles and turned them over to Patel, who had a voice like tea in winter. The injuries were bad but not the worst, the kind that earned a few months of rehabilitation and a story for grandchildren if you were lucky and your boss liked you enough when you came back lighter and warier. Oliver backed out of the trench and let the dirt fill his boots, then stood and rolled his shoulders. He felt lightheaded in a way that made him think his skull had dislodged slightly from its moorings, and he took two steps to the left to preserve the illusion of balance. Reyes looked at him and then looked away because the scene still had edges, and Oliver swallowed and told himself he was fine in a tone that he would not have tolerated from anyone else.

Back at the station, they stripped the mud from the tools and the talk came back slowly, like a crowd after a moment of silence. Harmon told the story of the foreman who had kept saying the word schedule with the sincerity of a man who had paid good money for the word and expected the universe to honor the receipt. Sosa texted a friend at Building Services because he liked to keep people honest when they might have otherwise forgiven themselves. In the kitchen, a volunteer had delivered a tray of casseroles from a church that had decided first responders were their new mission, and the food sat there like a challenge. Oliver assembled a plate that was more about the illusion of participation than about fuel and ate standing by the window where the view gave him permission to pretend he was distracted. Harmon, who could eat while reading the warnings on a pesticide bottle, slid in beside him and took a bite of something with cilantro and then pointed his fork at Oliver’s plate like a prosecutor.

“You eat that and become one of the faithful,” he said. “Or I’ll find a way to make that casserole appear in your locker the next time you open it in a hurry.”

Oliver smiled like the threat had landed on softer ground. “I’m saving space for the cookies your admirers will bring when they realize you’ve never said no to carbohydrates,” he said. “I wouldn’t want to deny you your fans.” Sosa wandered by and took a square that had congealed into a perfect block, and he made a face that suggested cheese could be a religion. Patel poured a glass of something with electrolytes for Oliver and left it on the counter without comment, and Oliver drank it because it had nothing to do with appetite and everything to do with duty.

Lena came in after lunch with her camera bag and a scarf wrapped twice around her neck like she had been warned about drafts since she was a child. She asked for permission with her eyebrows more than her words and moved around the room taking photos of hands and the mouth of the sink and the board where the call schedule lived like an oracle. Reyes watched her without hovering and then retreated to his office where the blinds were half closed in a way that made him look like a man sitting in a confession booth that nobody else had access to. When the crew drifted into the bay, Lena followed and sat on the wheel well, her camera in her lap as if she were trying to learn how to not use it in a place where everything was asking to be pinned down.

“You all right?” she asked Oliver when the others were occupied with arguing about the merits of pressure washers versus elbow grease. The question was so plain that if it had been heavier he might have ducked it; as it was, he had to stand there and let it hit him and decide how much of himself to let it take away.

“I am agreeable,” he said, because some days he answered questions as if he were passing notes in class. “We found two men who wanted to be found and gave them back to someone who will not know whether or not to be grateful. That’s better than yesterday and maybe worse than tomorrow. I’ll count it as a win and be irritated later if the book tells me otherwise.”

She tilted her head like she was trying to line his answer up with the pictures she had in her mind. “My advisor would say you’re dodging,” she said, and she didn't have to tell him he wasn't her advisor. “I would say you’re tired.”

“I’m at work,” he said, and the word work did a lot of work. “It’s different than tired.” She let it go, which made him feel both relieved and a little like he’d been spared a correction he probably deserved. Harmon said something about the paint chipping on the nozzle handles and the crew drifted that way, the shared attention like a school of fish changing direction in the same breath.

They had a community night scheduled, the kind that made the city feel small in a manageable way for an hour or two. Families would come and look at the engine and ask how much it weighed and if the siren hurt their ears and whether firefighters were allowed to grow mustaches anymore. Isabella, the community liaison who had survived three mayors and too many cuts to count, had dropped off boxes of stickers and a banner that made Reyes roll his eyes and hang it anyway. Just before they opened the bay doors, Oliver felt the hollow flicker in his middle that meant adrenaline had begun to go off-gassing, and he sat on the bench in the locker room and took five slow breaths with his eyes on the floor. His body had learned to ask for something then, a salt or a sugar or a lie, and he told it no with the stubbornness he saved for other people’s bad ideas.

The kids were honest the way people should be but rarely are after they learn how to pay rent. They asked if the fire was hot and if it was scary and if they could touch everything and not get in trouble. They asked if they could try on the helmet, and Oliver lifted it carefully onto a boy’s head and steadied his neck with his hand because the weight had surprised him. A little girl with hair like a dandelion asked if the dog he saved was okay now, and for a second he could feel the flutter of that heart against his wrist as if it were happening again. “He is living with a woman who calls him Mr. President and gives him too much chicken,” he said, and the little girl nodded as if that were a fate she desired for everyone.

Lena moved through the room in a way that did not make parents tighten their grip on their purse straps and did not make men tell jokes to feel taller. She took photos of hands on rails and the way light fell through the front of the engine onto the floor where the soap had once been spilled and never quite washed out. Reyes took a turn at the table with the stickers and a boy in a dinosaur shirt asked him if firefighters did homework and Reyes told him they did reports, which was a lie that had the shape of the truth. Harmon did a demonstration with the thermal camera and the crowd made the sound people make when science shows them what they already knew.

After the families drifted out and the last kid yelled thank you over his shoulder in a voice that would one day be a problem for a coach or a neighbor, the station settled into the aimless quiet of evening. Lena lingered near the bay door and traced the edge of the chalk line where Oliver had marked out the drill earlier that week, her toe smearing it a little until her shoe took the evidence away. “He looks at you when he says things to the room,” she said, and he didn’t have to ask who he was. “My father. He thinks subtlety is courtesy.”

“He thinks subtlety keeps people from having to be ashamed,” Oliver said, and it landed closer to his bone than he had expected. “The problem is that shame has a long reach.” They stood there for a moment like pedestrians waiting for a light in a city that would let them cross anyway if they wanted to risk it. He thought about stepping closer because the room felt so wide suddenly and because he wanted to see what her face would do if he stole some distance, and then he thought about Reyes and about the way Lena had said father with dust on it, and he stayed where he was.

“Are you hungry?” she asked, and it was not a trap and not a seduction and not a rescue. It was a question that, as soon as it existed, joined the room legitimately as if it had paid admission. He took too long to answer and then he said no in a tone that lived exactly between a truth and a lie, and she did not press him. She had a critique to prepare for next week that would be about light and ethics and whether the eye can ever be innocent, and he had a drill to set up for the morning that would pretend to be about rope and would really be about trust. They said goodnight in the kind of voice people use when sleep is a thing they have to negotiate with instead of receive.

The call that woke them felt like a coin rolling around in a wooden bowl. Mixed occupancy, the tablet read, laundry and apartments above, smoke showing, possible entrapment, alarms remote and uncertain. They rolled in under a sky that still hadn’t made up its mind to become night, a smear of cloud hugging the mountains like the hem of a dress. The laundromat’s sign had letters missing so it announced itself as LAUNDR MAT, which felt both sad and efficient, and a man in a jacket with a sports team on it stood outside wringing his hands as if he were auditioning for a stage he had talked himself onto.

Fire has habits in buildings like that. It looks for lint traps and plywood walls and the grate of a stairwell where someone has tucked a broken chair to keep it from falling back down. Oliver snapped his mask into place and shouldered the line, Harmon behind him, Sosa on the second, Reyes directing them with a voice that was daylight even in the dark. The heat rolled out with the dignity of an old man rising from a chair, and the light inside the laundromat flickered the way bad intentions do when history arrives. They moved fast because speed and smart have a Venn diagram you want to live inside, and they swept the floor once with a line of water that made the fire change its mind about being in charge.

A neighbor shouted that there was a woman upstairs who had not come out and a boy who had run back in for something that sounded like it could not possibly be worth the risk, and Reyes peeled Oliver and Harmon off and pointed them at the stairwell. The stairs were carpeted with something that had been blue when the building was new, and it smoked as if remembering how pretty it had been then. On the landing, the air tasted like detergent in its death throes, and Oliver could see the shape of a door at the end of the hallway that stood open like an accusation. The boy came out of a different doorway clutching a laptop and coughing in that hard, barking way that sounds like an argument with your lungs, and Harmon grabbed him by the scruff of his jacket and turned him toward the stairs with a shove that would read as love later when everyone’s heartbeat came down.

The woman was in the bathroom with the shower running because people believe steam is a negotiator. She was light and impossible and unconscious by the time Oliver lifted her, and he communicated with Harmon in the way you do when you’ve carried someone together before. The room narrowed to the line, to the hand on his shoulder, to the mad geometry of getting a limp body through a doorway that had been installed by someone who thought construction was poetry. His air clicked down a notch in his ear, a warning nobody could call subtle, and he noted it and filed it and kept moving because the calculus of sixteen seconds versus three had lodged itself under his ribs years ago.

They came out onto the stairs and he could feel his legs remember that they were human. At the landing, the heat picked up in a way that suggested the building was thinking about changing the subject on them, and Oliver took the woman’s weight closer, his bicep making a claim his stomach was not sure it could honor. The hallway did a small gray shimmy and he blinked hard enough to see stars. Harmon said something and he did not catch it, and then Harmon’s palm hit him between the shoulders, not a blow, not a pitying touch, just a recalibration. They took the last flight in a lurch and then they were out into air where people were shouting names that did not belong to anybody on the crew. Reyes was at the bottom of the stairs with the kind of knowing in his eyes that made Oliver want to throw his mask into the gutter just to distract him, and he transferred the woman into hands that were already fitting oxygen to her face and counting the seconds that would tell them how her story would go.

He sat on the bumper and let the line of his air click down again and thought he might throw up, which he did not do because he had trained himself to deny his body any spectacle. He took his mask off and looked at the building as if it had betrayed him, and it stared back with its windows like unblinking eyes that had seen everything and objected to nothing. Sosa called out a status that was both hopeful and exact, and Harmon took the boy with the laptop by the elbow and put him next to a police officer who would make sure he was not an idiot again in the same hour. Reyes came over like a man finishing a lap and looked at Oliver and then at nothing and then back at Oliver again.

“Air is not a suggestion,” he said, and the words were so calm that they were almost gentle, and the gentleness made them furious in Oliver’s chest. “I will not ask you if you heard your click-downs. I will ask you if you plan on being at work tomorrow, which you will not be if you keep pretending to be someone you don’t need to be in order to do your job.”

“I am at work now,” Oliver said, and the words were brittle enough that he could have used them to cut a rope. “I brought her down. We brought her down. I am aware of the math.”

“You are not a ledger,” Reyes said, and he had a way of saying that to men who had survived being treated as columns of debits and credits before they ever walked into the firehouse. “You don’t get to overdraw because you like the feeling of almost. You don’t get to chase the cliff edge because the view is better there.”

Oliver nodded because he recognized the script even if he hated the scene. Harmon tossed him a bottle of water without looking and it hit his thigh and rolled, and he picked it up and took a mouthful and it made his teeth hurt. The EMT working the woman called out a number that sounded promising, and the neighbors who had gathered in their pajamas made that uneven noise people make when a stranger’s life becomes briefly more important than their own. The laundromat owner stood with his hands in his hair like a man who had chosen his life for its simplicity and been lied to, and a police officer grunted about the door that had been blocked by a table someone had used for folding towels.

They went back in and mopped up because water wants direction and you have to give it one. The lines hissed and the dryers coughed and the building sighed like it had been convinced to stay upright for now. When they were done, the steam lay on the ceiling like a hope that had gone unexamined, and they rolled hose with the care of people folding flags. Oliver’s hands stung where the heat had imprinted itself in fine, precise letters, and he flexed his fingers as if he could read them if he moved fast enough. In the bay back at the station, he cleaned his gear with a thoroughness that was part penance and part muscle memory, and when Harmon said that he’d been a half second late on that corner, Oliver nodded because it was both true and insufficient.

Sleep came like a grudging guest who knows you only cleaned for them because society demanded it. Oliver lay in the quiet and counted his heartbeats and pretended the number did not matter. When it was still dark in the way that makes you doubt morning will ever arrive, he got up and went to the small room with the rowing machine and sat down and pulled, slow and sure, as if the chain would tell him something he could not hear anywhere else. He closed his eyes and saw the staircase and the click of his air and the way the woman’s hair had clung to his sleeve. He opened them and saw himself in the mirror and did not look away soon enough.

His phone lit up on the bench and he let it glow twice before he reached over and checked it. A message from a number he had not named but had cataloged in his head, a line that said, The photo you didn’t know I took is beautiful and not for anyone’s eyes but yours, trust me to delete it if you tell me to, and I will. He could feel his chest rearrange itself trying to make room for the words, and he read it twice the way you read instructions on medication you have already taken. He typed back a sentence that had too many commas and then scratched it and wrote, Keep it if it makes the day better for you and not worse. I don’t need to see it to know what you saw. Then he put the phone face down and pulled again on the chain and felt the machine answer him in the only language it had.

Morning did arrive, gray and then pink like a bruise that wasn’t sure how many colors it wanted to be. The city stretched in small, rude ways—garbage trucks, a couple arguing through a closed car window, a man running in shorts because he refused to admit that seasons applied to his knees—and the station exhaled into the new day with the relief of a body that has survived another night. Reyes called a brief, said something about a wildland mutual aid request brewing up Big Cottonwood, gestured at a weather map like it owed him an apology, and reminded them to check their packs because shelter is a religion when the world decides to test how fast your feet are.

Oliver nodded and felt the rope wind itself around his chest in a way that could be read as anticipation if you wanted to be generous. He told himself he would eat something before they rolled because you do not go into the canyon without fuel, and his body and his pride argued like neighbors over a fence. He stood in the kitchen looking at an apple as if it were an adversary with excellent dental work and then took a bite and another and finished it faster than he wanted to and let the ache sit under his ribs like a small, honest animal. He washed his hands and ran a towel over the sink and thought about chalk lines and air and light and the space between the tone and the choice, and when the bay doors rolled up and the world found them again, he was already moving toward the engine in a line that was not straight but that he had convinced himself would take him where he needed to go.Chapter 5

They rolled east with the canyon pulling the road into a narrower thought, the city spilling out behind them like a glass of water someone had finally decided not to catch. Big Cottonwood always made Oliver feel like he was entering a place that had learned to keep its own counsel. The granite shouldered up out of scrub oak and aspen, and the creek ran clear enough that fly fishers and children insisted, in different languages, that it forgave a person for wanting. The smoke chalked pale lines high up on the rock faces where wind had pushed it into place like an artist deciding when to stop. Engine 3 led a loose train of city rigs and a Type 6 brush truck on loan from a smaller department that mostly babysat fairgrounds and Fourth of July mishaps. Up ahead, a county engine idled with an old-school steadiness, its water tank scabbed with hard use and its pump panel scratched into a crude diary by wrenches and gloved hands.

They staged in the turnout near the old quarry where a command trailer had planted itself like a white seed. The map on the folding table had more tape than edge, and the Division Supervisors spoke in a register that made it sound like they had all been friends once, briefly, before this career made colleagues of them. A helicopter thumped somewhere out of sight, drown and drum, and the radio traffic was clipped but unpanicked. South aspect, single digits humidity, gusts pushing down-canyon in fits, potential for spots on the east side of the road, keep an eye on the slope by the pullout near Butler, copy that, copy.

Reyes stood with his hands behind his back the way he did in briefings, like he was giving his attention something to lean against. He turned his head toward his crew only when there was something to translate. “We’re structure protection for the cabins in the next bend,” he said, voice low enough to be private but not secretive. “We’ll wrap the propane tanks, cut back what we can cut back, set sprinklers if the water gods are friendly, and bail if it becomes a debate we can’t win. LCES, no exceptions. Harmon, watch for the yahoos who love their sheds more than their lungs. Sosa, you and Patel on triage if any civilians pop, but do not become their ride off the mountain unless Division tells you. Oliver, your line. Keep them honest.”

The cabin cluster had the look of an idea that had gotten out ahead of itself—three A-frames from the seventies, two newer chalets with glass that wanted to be a lake, one listing shack with a roof of corrugated metal and a satellite dish that looked like a joke that had outlived the laughter. The creek did its stubborn, beautiful work fifteen feet behind them, a reminder that not every movement of water can be harnessed. They rigged hose around decks like garlands and set sprinklers to hiss and tick and silver the air. Harmon found a rake and started pulling pine needles off a roof as if it were the most satisfying job in Utah. Sosa went at a ring of dead grass around a propane tank like the tank had insulted his mother. Patel tagged a set of outbuildings with fluorescent tape and a number system he could explain to a frightened person in under twenty seconds.

Oliver ran progressive lays around the exposed flanks of the cluster and put his hand on lumber and felt where heat would want to go. The smell of sap and dust lived under the sharper chemical of bar oil and the old iron tang of chain saw teeth. He walked distances and came back to himself with the surprised relief of a man who had left his front door unlocked and found nothing missing. He drank deliberately from his bottle, long pulls he could count, and the apple he’d eaten earlier sat in his middle like a truce he was not sure he had negotiated in good faith. When Division crackled a reminder about a forecasted gust front sliding off the shoulder of the Wasatch like a pitcher tipping its lip, the hair on his arms stood up inside the shirt he wore under his Nomex and he took it as confirmation that his body still loved him enough to warn him of obvious things.

Residents came and went in a nervous choreography that would have been funny if it weren’t dangerous. A man with a beard that had seen bands you had to be told about loaded a kayak and his grandmother’s cookie tin into the back of an SUV while ignoring Sosa’s polite entreaties to leave the propane grill for another day. A woman in a puffer vest handed Oliver a bag of dog food and asked if the fire would take the scent and find her house with it, and he told her, with that careful mix of humor and honesty you begin to master or else stop showing up, that fire did not track like a bloodhound even when the world felt like a crime scene. A boy with a gap-toothed grin dragged a cardboard box labeled LEGO down the steps and kept looking over his shoulder as if the flames might be personified and recognize his treasure; Harmon walked beside him as if escorting a celebrity to a waiting car, solemn and exaggerated and oddly tender.

The wind came like someone had opened a door to a room that had been waiting out of sight, a movement felt first on the cheek, then in the tops of the aspen, then in the line of smoke that had been content to laze and now decided to get to work. The column angled, thin branches shivered, and embers lifted like the spilled contents of a jeweler’s tin. “Heads up for spots across the road,” Division said, laconic and deadly. “Engines on Structure Group White, check your backyards, tie your anchors. Santa Ana cosplay incoming.”

Oliver felt the world tilt; the map in his mind reorganized without panic. He ran the line along the edge of a deck where needles had drifted into patient clumps, and he wet down the corner that would end up being the hinge if the fire decided this would be a door. Harmon shouted something to him about a spot near the leaning shack, and Oliver saw the little lick finding the dry grass around a stack of split wood as if fire were a friend who wanted a place to sit. They moved as a pair without discussing it, Oliver taking the flank, Harmon pinching the top, water taking the shape the stream allowed it and then insisting on more. The spot sighed out and went gray around the edges in a way Oliver always found more beautiful than flame. He stepped back, scanning, breathing in the acrid leaf tannins and hot dust logic, and then he saw the shape—movement where there should have been none.

A young man, early twenties if that, hair too long for his hard hat because he didn’t own one, sprinted up the path between the two glass-faced chalets carrying a cat carrier that was empty and rattling with the urgency of an unmade plan. He wore a hoodie with a dispensary logo and shoes that were insulted by terrain. Oliver felt his stomach knot, not because of the risk, but because of the inevitability. He cut across the yard in three long steps and caught the kid with his free hand at the elbow. “You’re done,” he said, the two words the firmest thing he knew how to give without a badge. “Out. We’ll check the unit for whatever you left.”

“My roommate’s on the way. He has the truck. We can get the drums,” the kid said, breath jagged and eyes not quite looking anywhere you would trust. Behind him, the wind threw a handful of sparks into the junipers like a negotiation we’d all regret later.

“Great story,” Harmon said cheerfully, appearing at Oliver’s shoulder with his rake like a medieval weapon. “We’ll tell it at the bar if this whole subdivision does not become the punchline. Go. Now. Look at me. Now.” He has a barker’s gift, Harmon, a way of making something ridiculous sound like the last sensible act in a collapsing world.

The kid blinked and then, as if he had found an order that worked on the little machine in his chest, turned and bolted back down the path. Oliver let him go, feeling that brush of skin and hoodie cotton fade in the wind; he tensed the line and moved back to the deck edge where embers were landing and winking like eyes making promises they had no intention of keeping. His hands were steady; his mouth tasted metallic. He told himself he would ask Sosa for a gel pack as soon as this little flurry settled, not because he wanted one, but because he knew the future and had plans to meet it on time.

It did not settle. The gust front arrived like a letter from an ex you’d both done a poor job of forgetting, sudden and reminding, flipping the world from leisurely to accountable. Embers flew farther, the tongue of fire down canyon found a slope it liked better and tasted it enthusiastically, and across the road a spot turned into a run that turned into a small wall that turned into a voice louder than the one in Oliver’s head. “Structure Group White, Division,” the radio said, almost bored, which is how men sound when they are telling you the news that will make you live differently. “We have a roll down above Butler drain. Group Black is pinched. If you can peel two engines for a bump to the second switchback, we’ll buy them a minute. No heroics. We still like you.”

Reyes didn’t look like anything when he turned. He just was the shape of a decision. “Sosa, hold the cluster with Harmon,” he said. “Oliver, with me. Patel, ride with County. We’re going to go be neighborly for ninety seconds and then get very boring again.”

They took the road at a trot that felt like a betrayal to Oliver’s quads and a chance for his heart to remember its purpose. At the second switchback the drag was ugly—timber and brush tumbled down a cut-bank with the messiness of a college apartment post-party, flame chewing at it like a dog chasing its own tail, heat sideways and rude. The county engine had nosed in at a bad angle born of a good impulse, and a volunteer crew in yellow shirts from a valley department that mostly did parades looked at the problem like it had just answered a question they hadn’t finished asking.

“Water on the low,” Reyes called before anyone could talk themselves into clever. “Low, then high. Oliver, hit that snag where the skein toss is feeding. No, lower. Let it come to you. Don’t chase. Nobody dies stylish in this canyon today.”

Oliver found the angle, found the hour the water wanted, found the moment when foam would be something other than a placebo, and wove the line across the tumble as if he were teaching it to breathe. The heat found him through Nomex and manners, a convincing hand on the face. He felt, distantly, how far away food was in the long-ago day and how unfair the body could be when it decided to tally debts. He locked an elbow and blinked slow and kept the thinking part of him small. The county captain slid with his hand under a roll of chain-link that someone had thought to lay as a net months earlier and made eye contact with Reyes in that particular way people who have both failed and survived learn to talk.

They pinched it. The run eased, the ugly tangle settled, and the big voice of the fire went back to talking to itself somewhere higher on the slope where the brush angled in lines you could trace but not own. Three chickens appeared out of nowhere and scurried in a line across the road like children late for a dance class. Harmon laughed over the radio, one strangled sound that made the Division Supervisor say copy with a little more fondness than professionalism. Oliver exhaled and felt his knees take inventory. He was fine. He was entirely, infuriatingly fine.

They were stepping backward into sense when the tree went. Lodgepole, not big by mountain standards and somehow still too much, roots burned on the one side and greedily drinking wind on the other, a gentle lean turned into gravity finding its voice. The callout, “Tree! Tree!” came clipped and late because you never quite believe the thing will commit. Reyes was already moving; he always did before his body announced it. He stumbled and caught himself and then the trunk knocked down the slope and clipped the county captain’s thigh with a dull sound that suggested the swamp of pain to come.

The world narrowed, again, as worlds do, but not to fire, to weight and limb and pressure. Oliver took a step toward the sound, already constructing levers out of the landscape, and felt that cold little ring around his spine cinch tight in a way that said the math he’d been avoiding would not be changed by will. His body had been clever for hours, negotiating with physics and ego, but it was still just a body. He saw the county captain’s face go slick and receive the idea of shock; he saw Reyes get lower rather than faster, smarter rather than braver, and he put his line on the hold and moved in. Sosa came up like a consequence with a halligan, and Harmon found a bad wedge and made it a better one, and the stupid tree went from god to furniture in the span of the oldest human trick we ever learned.

They got the leg free without losing the leg. They did the wrapping and the splinting and the for-once gentle words that come out of hard men like something they’d been saving for a better use. Patel stood ready with the medic’s alarm barrier around his expression, and a helicopter said it was close enough if they would be so kind as to make a rectangle out of chaos. The fire agreed to take a breath exactly long enough for the bird to settle a litter into a world that looks, on television, like a stage designed for heroes. Oliver watched the captain’s face go gray and then less gray and thought, ridiculously and accurately, that he would see that expression later in his own reflection and not have a name for it.

Reyes touched Oliver’s shoulder once after the rotor wash and before the radio remembered them. The touch was lighter than a scold and heavier than a faith. “I need you to be here,” he said, voice quiet like an aside in a church. “Not almost here. Not hero-adjacent. Here.”

“I am,” Oliver said, and he meant it in the moment in the way men mean things that they can only commit to in twelve-minute increments. The wind dropped an octave. Division was in their ear, thanking, reallocating, pointing them back downhill to their modest cluster of cabins that still stood like children who had behaved themselves despite a bad influence. The county engine limped toward the road with a different driver, and the volunteer department’s eyes were wide in a way that would make their post-incident pizza more sober than usual. They hiked back toward the chalets, lungs ragged, legs righteous, a ribbon of sweat drawing hieroglyphics under their collars.

The rest of the afternoon did its best to become routine, that blessed, lying thing. They made circles around the things people had decided were valuable, they watched the ridge line chatter to itself, they adjusted sprinklers and shook out kinks and picked pine needles from their cuffs and pretended to be unimpressed by the day’s second helicopter. The spot fires came smaller and easier to convince. A convoy of SUVs with indifferent expressions crept up the road and then crept back down because a deputy with forearms like fence posts was tired of letting people test their version of luck. Sosa shared a second bottle of water with Oliver by pretending he’d been handed three by mistake. Harmon found a peanut butter sandwich in a Ziploc someone’s wife had made for someone else and made a documentary out of eating it that earned him an acorn thrown by a squirrel that had decided it liked irony. Oliver chewed two bites of a granola bar that had been living in his pocket long enough to know his secrets and told himself it counted.

When evening rolled itself down the canyon walls, the light went that clean late-gold that both affirms and mocks. The line of the fire’s edge had softened into a shape everyone could pretend to understand. Division released the city rigs first because public relations pretended it was logistics sometimes, and Reyes accepted the thank yous with a nod and the subdued satisfaction of a man who had been invited to leave before he embarrassed himself by wanting to keep helping. They rolled past the quarry and then the trailheads and then out under the mouth of the canyon, where you can feel the valley inhale you like it hadn’t known where you’d gone. The crew didn’t talk much. Someone’s elbow knocked a helmet, someone’s boot scuffed a compartment door, someone’s breath steadied in that audible way you learn not to be embarrassed by.

Back at the station, the smell of ash and wet webbed into the engine bay with the sweetness of something someone had baked as a bribe for fate. Isabella had left a plate of scones covered with a note that said, You owe me nothing, which in the language of civic kindness meant, Please don’t die on a day when I’m a little tired. Harmon grabbed one and bit in and made a sound that belonged on the wrong side of any door you had to knock on, and Sosa took half and sandwiched it with a piece of cheddar he found in the back of the fridge and called it innovation. Oliver took a scone and broke it into quarters, ate one, told himself he would spend the next quarter in fifteen minutes, and then put the plate down. His hands shook so gently it could have been a trick of the light.

Reyes made the phone calls he had to, the ones the county expected, the ones his boss required, the one to the county captain’s department to say, He’s at the hospital you trust, he had his boots on; somehow that always matters, and then he stood at the kitchen counter with his head bowed like grace without the prayer and filled out a form that would be scanned and filed and never read again by someone who had not been there. He carried his clipboard to the whiteboard and scribbled a note under tomorrow that said, Gear wash, brush truck loan returns, check saws, and then he underlined check. He stood there another moment and then turned without looking for anyone specifically and said, “Food is not optional,” and walked out of the room like the sentence could not belong to a conversation when the conversation had not yet earned it.

Oliver showered until his skin objected. The water ran gray then clear, the heat first accusatory then kind, and he leaned his forehead against tile long enough for the grout to leave a mark. In the locker room he sat with the towel around his waist and let his breath find an agreement with itself. The hunger he had been shepherding all day had become something else, a noise that was both background and headline, and it made his forearms feel empty and his back feel like a page that had been erased too hard. His phone, face down near his wallet, buzzed once. He ignored it, then gave in, then told himself the order of those verbs made him a liar and a child.

A photo waited there, not the one she had promised to delete, not the one he had agreed not to see. This one was a square of light that made a lie out of smoke. The sprinklers at the cabins had made a drifting mist and the low angle of the sun had turned it into a pale rainbow that nobody who was busy saving their life had noticed, and in that arc was the edge of Oliver’s elbow and the line of the hose and the bit of deck that had a nail sticking up like a bad idea. He could taste metal again, not from air, but from the way a moment like that sits in your mouth. Lena’s text under it was precise. The professor would say I am sentimental. I am practicing being correct instead.

He typed something that looked like thanks and then deleted it, typed something about light being a liar and deleted that, typed, You have good aim, which was either an insult or a compliment depending on the room, and sent it because he wanted to send something that was not an essay. Her reply came back after a longer pause than his body thought necessary. I was thinking about lines. The ones that help and the ones that hide. You looked like you knew the difference today.

He held the rectangle of glass in his palm and felt how absurd it was that it weighed less than the tools he trusted. He tried to imagine showing Reyes the text and laughed, one short bark that made an echo in the shower room where the tile had opinions. He put the phone away and got dressed and went into the kitchen where the scones had dwindled to a third of a plate and the pot on the stove smelled like soup trying not to be proud. He ladled a modest bowl and sat where the light did not make a performance of anyone. Harmon told a story about a man in flip-flops who had tried to ask directions to a spot fire like it was a bar with a cover charge, and Sosa rolled his eyes all the way to the ceiling and still managed to look generous. Reyes took a seat across and didn’t say anything and then said too much with his silence.

They cleaned with the small choreography that makes a place worth living in: rinse, stack, wipe, pause, repeat. The night had turned the bay into a long mirror where the engine looked both proud and embarrassed. Oliver walked through the apparatus floor and checked the saws because the note on the board had given him permission to be the man he already was. He sharpened a chain nothing by hand because sharp was a prayer even on days you never said any. He felt the steadiness come back into his wrists and tried not to make a religion of it.

He found Lena by accident near the side door that led to the little triangle of grass where smokers had failed to make a culture before the city helped them stop. She stood with her camera bag on, the strap worn in a way that looked more intimate than jewelry, and looked like she had said a thing to a room earlier that had made someone nod and not quite agree. She looked at him like she had been standing there rehearsing something else and decided against it. He opened his mouth and then remembered that the air with the woman on the stairwell had clicked down and that he had ignored it because math would always forgive him if he begged nicely enough.

“I am not going to give you a lecture,” she said, and then smiled with a sideways bravado. “Not because I don’t have one. Because I am not the person who is allowed.”

“You are the person who knows the lecture I’m going to give myself,” he said, straightening the habit-bent stiffness out of his shoulders. “Your father delivered the soft version. I ignored the hardware store of the language he used: gasket, valve, vent. I’ll go buy the right wrench in the morning. I’m good at errands.”

She moved her weight from one foot to the other and looked past him at the bay as if the engine could overhear and be comforted. “You’re not allowed to be hollow,” she said. “That’s not fair and it’s not true. You’re allowed to be light and not feel like a liar when you admit it.”

“Lightness is just another word for ignoring the math,” he said. He didn’t know until he heard himself that he believed it. Her face did not close. It didn’t open, either. It waited, like the creek had done earlier when they had set the sprinklers and pretended they were still in charge.

“My father can’t protect me from your choices,” she said, and now dust was thick on the word father again. “I can protect me from your choices. I would prefer that you protect yourself. I am finding that sentence as a thesis unwieldy.”

He wanted to tell her that he had been trying to earn the right to that suggestion long before she’d walked into the bay with a camera. He wanted to tell her that he had made bargains with hunger and control and competence and that the receipts did not always add up to what he had promised himself. Instead he said, “We found a man under a tree,” and saw her eyes make a picture out of his words that she would not take because she was trying to live a life that did not require theft.

They stood there long enough that the light in the bay clicked off on a timer that always managed to feel like an opinion. She said goodnight in a voice that did not tilt toward him or away. He watched her leave and then watched the glass door hold the last frame of her and then give it up. He went back inside because the day had more demands; it always did. Reyes had a stack of forms and a calendar entry that would make a dent in his morning. Harmon had found a stray coin on the floor and was giving it a whole character biography. Sosa was texting someone who had been promised he would not call late and was calling anyway because names like brother and friend do not respect clocks when hills have been on fire.

That night the station made the kind of sleep that is more about stopping than restoration. Oliver lay down and counted the beats and told himself to not invent numbers when he did not like the ones he had been given. He woke to the undertone of the building and the low of trucks sleeping and the single pop of an exterior metal panel reminding the night that it changed temperature even if the stars pretended not to notice. No call came. The rest ached into him in sheets rather than in a single blanket. In the morning the mountains came on like a slow confession outside the dorm windows. He made coffee that listened to him. He tried the oats again and ate half and said aloud, “We are not negotiating,” and listened to the way the plural made the room less roomy.

On the board someone had written in Harmon’s stupid bubble letters, DO NOT FORGET THE SAWS ARE MEAN TODAY. Under it, in Reyes’s neat print, read, PACKS TO 7 BY 0900. Oliver found the discipline and did the things the letters asked him to. He checked his gear twice and then put his hands on the turnout coat and then took them off. He found the rope for the confined space drill and ran it through his fingers as if it had answers, and it did, but only to questions he had not asked yet. His phone buzzed once, then again, and he let it, because control has to be practiced when the stakes are the lowest for it to hold when they are not.

When he finally picked it up there was a message, not a photo. I am driving out to Magna to shoot a scrap yard, the text said. It feels like a betrayal. Do you have a ritual for disloyalty that does not involve hurting yourself. The question landed somewhere behind his ribs and then turned in place and made itself at home. He typed, Count what you will not take. Say each thing out loud. Walk away and bring back only what says your name. Then add one thing that you do not deserve and keep it anyway. He stared at the syntax and saw the person who had written it and was not proud and was not ashamed.

He put the phone down and picked up the saw with the chain he’d sharpened after the canyon. He pulled the start and felt the engine turn, stubborn, then willing. He breathed. He did not count. He was here. He was, for the span of that hum and the smell of fuel finding its spark, exactly where any map would have promised he’d be. Outside, the city stitched itself back into a grid. Inside, the chalk line on the bay floor waited to be erased and drawn again. He tightened the bar nut till it seated and looked up and saw Reyes watching him and nodding once in a way that said this might not be the chapter where tragedy arrived, but they all knew it had a chair waiting. He turned the saw off and the quiet was heavy and honest, and he let it rest on them both.Chapter 7

The inversion sat on Salt Lake like a lid that had been screwed down by a careless god. From the bay, the city looked drawn in pencil and then rubbed with a thumb. The mountains were rumors behind the gray, and every breath carried the taste of someone else’s exhaust and yesterday’s woodstove. Oliver felt the air in his throat like a reminder and glanced at the board where Reyes had underlined Hydrate twice, as if underlining added ounces to a bottle. He poured water and drank with the determination of a man making a contract, then set the cup down and listened to the way the station sounded inside this new muting—voices cottoned, equipment clicks like someone tapping on glass three rooms over, the distant freeway doing its long, low hymn.

Around eight, Isabella came through with flyers for a community class in a church basement and a tray of muffins she framed as experimental. She called them energy muffins and gave Harmon a look that dared him to mock her and still eat two. Oliver broke one in half, ate a quarter, smiled at the way cinnamon pretended to be enough, and told himself there would be oatmeal later, that he would not bargain with himself about when later was. Hunger, the friend he had named because friends can be asked to behave, sat down on the bench beside him and didn’t speak. He could feel it there the way you can feel someone you love on a couch watching a show you’ve both already seen, both waiting for a line to land for the thousandth time and make you laugh anyway.

Lena appeared at the edge of the bay with her camera bag like a synonym for a conversation. She had on a coat that would have been bright in a different day and boots that took offense at slush. Reyes was in his office with the blinds at polite angles, and Harmon was tuning the thermal camera on a round of washers like he could watch heat move across their faces. Oliver pretended he was reorganizing the compartment with the rescue straps and then stopped pretending, laying the webbing flat, palming the buckles until they gleamed with used honesty. When she stepped closer, he could hear the little click of the zipper pull on her bag tapping against itself, a kind of nervous punctuation that made him want to take a period and smooth it down into a line.

“I’m not shadowing tomorrow,” she said without introduction, and the way her mouth set made it clear she had already had this conversation somewhere else. “My advisor pushed me hard, which is his job, and my father asked me to think about the difference between knowing a story and becoming a character in it. I keep confusing the two. I sent in an application for a two-week residency in Moab. They want people to write about rust and red rock and what it does to the eye. I’m going to go if they let me. I’m going to go if they don’t.”

He wanted to say he was proud of her, the way people say that like it has no cost, and he wanted to say he understood about being a character when all you meant to do was witness. He said neither, because Digestion was not a thing he wanted to share with anyone that morning. “Moab will make your sentences worse and then better,” he said, which sounded enough like a blessing he didn’t immediately hate himself for it. “Just don’t make friends with a cliff.”

She smiled, small and real, and then let it go. “You look thinner when the light is gray,” she said, and it could have been an accusation and wasn’t. “When there’s sun, people lie. You don’t lie as well in this weather.” She lifted the camera and then didn’t shoot, as if the image had already taken itself inside her and putting it on the card would only cheapen it. “Eat the rest of the muffin, Oliver,” she added, and it was not a request and not a dare. It was the way you might say, Check your air, when you trust someone but do not trust the day.

He ate it because he could not think of a single reason not to that would hold up in a room with her sentences. Cinnamon came back like memory. He felt the soft of it fight a little with his tongue before it gave up and let itself be part of him. He drank more water and told himself the sound the cup made when it hit the counter was not a judgment. Reyes came out of his office and looked at them and then at nothing, the performing blindness of a man who wanted to leave certain things to the dignity of corners. “Community drill at Liberty Park got moved to Saturday,” he said to the room, which included everyone and nobody. “If anyone was planning on falling in love that day, pick a bench with good light.”

Before lunch, the call tone kicked them all in the ribs. The tablet lit with that flattening, tidy font: Commercial structure fire, smoke from eaves, multiple callers, occupants unknown, 1700 South and 900 West. The west side, where pallets stack their ambitions sky-high and forklifts carry prayers across concrete. Sosa was already pulling his hood up. Harmon crowed something obscene and energized that made Patel grin into his collar. Oliver felt the crisp simplicity of the work rise in him, a tide that washed all the complicated language off the rocks and left only nouns—line, door, heat, roof.

The rig rolled out into a street that made the gray feel personal. The inversion pressed down hard enough to shorten the horizon by half and the sun was a coin you’d find later in your pocket without remembering where it came from. The building in question was a single-story cinderblock with a metal skin and a proud sign that had peeled itself down to just the words STORAGE and PRO. Smoke bloomed dark along the roofline, a black that meant plastics or the lies that plastics burn with. A box truck with a painter’s logo slept smoking against the loading dock, one rear tire already a melted confession. Two men in safety vests waited in the parking lot with their palms up like someone had already asked for their hands and taken them.

Command landed fast in the mouth of the lot, Division calls clicked into place, the sound of other engines making their own case against the air. Reyes took a quick walk in that understated, surgical way he has, eyes on the structure like he could hear the studs decide whether to be loyal, and the first line went to the front for a door that did not want to be understood. A second line took the alpha-bravo corner where heat curled low and stubborn, trying to make a right angle into a spiral. Oliver went with Harmon on the knob through the front, Sosa backing them with the quiet force you’d want behind you if you knew you were about to get your sum wrong and needed somebody to balance the books.

Inside had the chaos of a place that was half show and half hoard. Steel shelving made lanes that would be tidy if the world had not last week tried to reorganize itself. Stacks of wrapped mattresses sulked along one wall like patient removes. A row of boxed space heaters was half eaten, the cardboard slumping into that particular, mean orange. Heat pushed at their knees and then lifted to tug at the back of their necks, indecisive in the way that pretends to be kind and isn’t. They flowed right, water ahead of them as diplomacy, the stream making the ugly smoke shy back without truly leaving.

“Truss roof,” Harmon said into his mic, words stiff against the plastic of his mask. “Looks old. Hearing that nice crackle like someone brought a bag of chips to a funeral.” Reyes’s voice came back even and quiet, like he had replaced a fuse someone had carelessly thrown. “Copy. No roof ops. Keep your heads. Lateral spread before vertical. Oliver, you own that corner. Do not make it a personality.”

Oliver moved the stream and watched the fire crank its own dimmer down, three notches, then a spiteful flare to make its point. He felt the tick in his ear that told him his air had passed a marker, easily plenty, more than plenty, and a strain beneath his ribs that he had come to recognize as an opinion he could ignore. He ignored it. The aisle ahead narrowed where some past version of a man had laid a trove of flattened cardboard as carefully as gold leaf. A glow came through the cracks low on the right, seductive in exactly the way you’d warn a child about and then remember the day you told them not to touch the stove for the first time.

There was a sound that doesn’t belong to fire and always does anyway—a distant bang that is really a shrug as something structural changes its mind. Sosa’s hand landed on Oliver’s shoulder in a pulse as if to keep him the size he currently was. “We do not chase,” Sosa said, and it was calm, but it had a leash in it. Harmon swung the stream high then low like a switch hitter buying himself a breath. A sprinkler head somewhere overhead finally melted into its prophesied action and gave them a light rain that turned the smoke to a thicker gray soup. The PASS alarm across the building began to trilling in the way that makes your spine straighten before your mind remembers who belongs to that sound.

“Alpha interior, status?” Reyes’s voice came, not panicked, not careless. Patel’s reply from the exterior sounded in their ears with too much air in it. “We’ve got a worker back exit side, bravo-charlie corner, coughing like his life resents him. Says Diego is still inside. Didn’t say where because men in his family do not say where. We’re working it.”

Oliver felt the old river open in him, the one that knows how to decide things faster than he can justify them. He put the stream down to kill the orange that was pretending it would go obediently if given this last respect, and then he pivoted toward the aisle that would lead toward the corner Patel had put words on. Harmon caught him with the hose shoulder and moved with him because they had made a vow once without saying it to never let the other go stupid alone. Sosa swore gently, the way a man does when he loves you and you have just made his life harder.

The aisle was worse there, low ceiling, shelving that had been talked into holding shapes it had not been born to hold, the peculiar plastic chuff of stretch wrap making its case for immortality. Heat felt wrong, now, the kind of wrong that says it is low for a reason that does not involve your comfort. Oliver’s air clicked down another notch and he flicked a glance to confirm what his ear had told him, then disobeyed the tug in his belly that suggested it was not a good day to test. He could hear coughing ahead, too wet, too deep, at a frequency that promises trouble for somebody’s shift later, and he pressed forward, stream short, purposeful, the pattern of it the only signature he was willing to write.

Diego was not in the corner where he should have been if a man had moved like a diagram. He lay on the floor between two rolling racks of discount office chairs, one hand clenched around a rag that had been a T-shirt, the other on his chest like he had been negotiating with himself about pacing. Oliver took the distance in two steps and went to his knees in water and grit and plastic confetti. He had his gloved hand on Diego’s jaw before he could count the man’s breaths, the angle wrong for kindness and exactly right for opening the airway enough to keep the story going. Harmon bent to take the man’s shoulders and looked at Oliver, not quite asking, not quite commanding. They moved him, careful, small, with the choreography you do not practice so much as repeatedly invent under pressure.

The building spoke then, in wood and metal, a change in pitch that every firefighter can translate without quite knowing any of the grammar. “Evac tone,” Command said, and in the same breath the electronic wail started, that scolding mother sound that even flat on your belly you will hear and find a way to interpret as not urgent if you want the room to keep letting you be brave. Oliver felt the tone in his guts and not his ears, which was a kindness and a threat. He hooked his hand under Diego’s arm and met Harmon’s eye and nodded, once, the kind of nod where you promise that you are not an idiot and also that you are going to be exactly the idiot he thinks you are.

They backed. Sosa was there before he could ask him to be, taking part of Diego’s drag with the insistent efficiency of a man who has lifted his share of the world. Oliver's air went down a click and the click felt louder than it had any right to in the middle of a building that was talking a lot. The heat climbed his back like a man thinking about jumping a fence. They got to the end of the aisle and the light in the front of the building was gray and impersonally kind, and then something—roof, grid, trick of the building’s long memory—shifted left and the aisle was no longer an aisle so much as a collection of disagreements.

There are moments that are described as slow that are in fact so fast your brain has to create extra frames to feel like it was there. Oliver felt the shelving on his right twitch, then acquiesce, then commit to falling; he felt Harmon’s weight leave his left for the fraction of time it takes for a man to reassign his entire plan; he felt Diego’s shoulder hinge in his hand and decided that he would not let anger transmit through bone. He chose, on a map that had been redrawn under his feet, the one small line that would still get them out of there as three men who would become a story later and not a plaque.

It would have worked if his body had been the body he believed he could insist on. The world grayed at the edges, then paled, just a little, and his calf spasmed in that mean way it does when you haven’t handed it enough salt or grace. He breathed too fast for a handful of seconds and then too slow for a handful more, which is not math you put in a report. Harmon reached back without turning and cupped Oliver’s elbow in a gesture that made Oliver want to laugh and cry, a gesture so paternal and unflinching that if he had been a more sentimental man he would have lied about it on a witness stand. “With me,” Harmon said, and if the tone had changed—softened, bossed, begged—Oliver would have resented it. It didn’t. Harmon said it like a man saying, This street is called 900 West whether or not you like the number, and Oliver went.

They made the front. Inside the doorway, the outside air felt like cold judgment on his teeth. The bullhorn sound of the evac tone continued like an old insult. A blast of hotter heat pushed out from a place behind them, and there were voices that did not belong to their team and belonged to all of them. Oliver took three steps and then four, Diego part-carried by three sets of arms that did not intend to drop him, and in the small safety of daylight doing its best through gray he almost stumbled. He swore instead, the swears you save for the car and the locker and the end of a board meeting, and then he heard his name said in the voice that used it like a reminder that it had always belonged to him and never to the job.

Reyes was in the doorway before anyone would have called it sensible. He filled the space without making himself big. His face was the controlled nothing he used when he didn’t want to write your reaction for you. He took Diego’s wrist with a medic’s quick fingers and handed the man down the chain to Patel and a private ambulance tech with forearms like saplings. Then Reyes’s hand landed on Oliver’s chest and stayed there for a beat that felt longer than all the beats in the room. “Out,” he said, as if the word were a stairstep he could hand over. “Now. That tone belongs to us.”

Oliver started to say something, which would have been the wrong thing, and then the building took away the possibility of saying anything right. The ceiling over the front aisle slumped in a sigh and then remembered gravity like a man remembers his debt, and what fell was not drama but exhausting, dense, workmanlike collapse—grid and insulation and the metal tongue of ductwork all at once in a clatter that didn't even have the grace to be loud. Harmon jerked back with a sound that made Oliver think of his knees bending under a sudden weight. Reyes turned between them and the new problem with that irritating, moving economy that makes you forget he isn’t thirty anymore, and the edge of a mobile shelving unit, liberated by the lie of vertical he had believed in all morning, clipped him across the back.

The blow took him down and half under, a tilt and press that pinned him with the stupidest kind of intent: not to crush, not to kill, just to insist. Reyes grunted and did not swear, which was worse. The evacuate tone kept right on with its temper. Harmon was moving before the part of Oliver that makes decisions caught up. He dropped the line and went for the shelving, got fingers under the lip, and levered in the way of a man who has earned every callus he owns. Sosa appeared on the other side like conjured competence and put a shoulder into the problem. “Count it,” Sosa said, and they did, one-two-three, a lift clean enough that if you’d been a bystander you would have believed there was choreography to it.

Oliver held Reyes’s arm in both hands while they freed him, the slick of sweat and soot making the skin an untrustworthy surface, and in those seconds he felt how light the captain’s wristbones were under his gloves. He did not like that image and put it away in a box he thought he would never open. Reyes slid out and to his knees with the insulted grace of a man who had been unexpectedly placed there. He exhaled like he was letting the building have one last thing so it would stop asking. His eyes went to Oliver’s face with something that should have been anger and was not. It was an inventory that finished and then wrote a short sentence: You are here.

They moved fast because it was time to make fast respectable. Patel was in the doorway before Oliver could ask for him, oxygen in hands and that unflappable, ancient gentleness in his posture. Harmon had a hand on Reyes’s shoulder in the kind of steady that has nothing to do with needing it and everything to do with offering it in case. Sosa kept the problem from becoming interesting again with his body set at a patient angle against the world. Oliver backed and kept his balance in a manner that was not graceful and not a failure and he wanted desperately to sit down and did not, because to sit would be to tell the truth, and nobody had asked him to do that yet.

Outside, the gray greeted them without knowing their names. Reyes lay down on his own back, which was a way of saying yes without humiliating himself. Patel cut his coat with Reyes’s permission, which he granted in a nod that made the kind of joke only men in pain laugh at. The crowd that had gathered in the parking lot had been pushed back into a line that did not want to be one. Diego coughed in a way that said he would regret everything and also get to a hospital with his pride still intact. A second alarm truck wailed in and then existed in the corner of everybody’s eye without being the main story.

“Where does it hurt?” Patel asked, and Reyes had the courtesy to answer the question and nobody else’s. “Back, lower,” he said. “Left side, sharp. Hip thinks it’s the boss, probably why we’re all so tired.” He didn’t look at Oliver when he made the joke and then did, once, briefly, like a man checking to see that the list he made in his head corresponded to the day he was handed. Oliver wanted to say sorry in five new ways and could only manage to close his mouth and open it again like he’d been knocked old-man simple by the heat.

They loaded Reyes with fine, ritual care and the ambulance took him in that weird calm that comes when professionals are doing exactly what they are meant to be doing. Sirens said private rather than city, the higher, faster song, and the rig rolled out and Harmon yelled at the back doors as if the vehicle would respect his voice and stop to be told one last joke. Sosa followed it with his eyes, then put them back where they belonged, on the building, on the lines, on the part of the world still burning.

Command shifted without needing to announce it, Reyes’s boss a voice both strange and expected in Oliver’s ear, assignments redistributed with the carrot and stick of habit. They mopped and pulled and watched the dumb places where fire keeps lying. They were fine enough the way you say that word to a parent so you can go back outside. One of the ceiling tiles from the office area fell down and hit the floor as if it had been waiting for a cue from a director who had left the theater early.

Back at the station, the world swallowed them and did not change color. Harmon threw his helmet at his locker and then picked it up gently as if he’d remembered in the middle of the throw that it had saved his face more than once. Sosa sent the message he had to send to a group chat that made itself useful on days like this. Patel washed his hands until the water ran cold and then still wouldn’t stop touching the soap. Oliver felt his body arrive in parts, heel first, then ankles, then the place in his thigh that had tightened and not mentioned it until now. He stripped and showered and watched gray streak away from his skin, then come back because you are not a white tile and do not get to be clean in a single pass.

His phone was lit with a text from an unfamiliar number that was only unfamiliar because he hadn’t saved it. University of Utah Emergency Department. Captain Reyes is stable. Imaging in process. He has asked that you not visit him until he tells you to. Somebody had decided to put the last sentence in because they didn’t trust him to translate hospital into human. He sat on the bench in the locker room and stared at the words so long the screen dimmed. He woke it up with the side of his thumb and the words were still there, which felt like a theft.

Lena’s name flashed next, as if the world had a sick sense of rhythm. It was not a question. He’s at the U. I’m here. He told me to go home. I’m not good at instructions. Are you hurt. The periods were hers, chosen, not the weird little autocorrect humor of punctuation showing up by accident. He typed back that he was not hurt the way you can be not hurt when a room has tried to keep you, and that he would do what Reyes asked because the country works better when you obey the obvious laws. He added, Tell him I am here and I will be here when he decides to remember me, and then deleted it because everything about the sentence tempted melodrama. He sent instead: Tell him we moved like we were taught. Tell him Harmon is eating for two in his honor. Tell him the shelf was a coward and we are not.

The debrief crept up on them like food poisoning—no appetite for it and then there it was anyway. The peer support captain with kind eyes sat at the end of the table and said normal things about what bodies do and what brains will attempt and how sleep will lie as a favor and as a check you can cash later. Harmon made one joke and then flinched when nobody laughed right away. Sosa kept his big hands on the table like surrender and then used them to wipe at a nonexistent spill. Patel said they should all drink water until they needed to pee just to feather into something they could measure, and for a second everyone imagined themselves as men whose worst problem was hydration and felt both foolish and comforted by the picture.

When the talk was over, Oliver didn’t go anywhere. He couldn’t find the doorway that would make leaving the room make sense. Hunger sat beside him like a silent friend who had stopped trying to get him to go home. He stood finally and went to the kitchen and took down a bowl. He found a tin of soup with a label that pretended language matters—a little looped font, a photo of vegetables nobody buys in real life—and opened it with a judicious, irritated swipe of the opener. He poured it into a pot and turned on the flame and stood there while it warmed, watching the surface change in little movements that had nothing to do with him. He added salt and then stopped himself and then added it anyway because he was not willing to pretend his body didn’t know the difference between kindness and cost.

He ate standing up and sitting down and neither felt like an answer. He chewed. He paused. He breathed. His stomach made a soft noise that belongs to animals when they recognize the sound of their own keeper coming up the path. He took another mouthful and hated and loved that it did not ask him for a justification. His phone buzzed once. Lena again. He’s in pain but he is making the kind of faces that will make the nurses fall in love with him. He asked me if I ate. I wanted to throw my chair and then marry him. Please eat.

He texted back a photo of the spoon and the bowl and the little drips on the burner like punctuation. He put the phone down and picked the spoon up again and the world did not get better. It mutated, just enough that he could count backward from a number and feel the count doing a job. He spoke out loud to the air because he had promised himself once to try that when buildings stopped making sense. “We’re going to do this in the way that doesn’t get anyone else hurt,” he said, and his voice shook only at the very end like a mistake in a note. He didn’t say the name of the person he meant by we. It was him. It was hunger. It was the job. It was also, treacherously and not to his credit, Reyes.

Later, long after gear had been hung and the bay had been mopped and the texts had thinned into the harmless logistics of tomorrow, Oliver walked to the back stairwell where the draft found its way around the edges of the door and into the building like truth. He dialed a number he had not used since it was given to him in a pamphlet that had seemed like a polite imposition at the time. The voice that answered did not sound like help. It sounded like an ordinary person who had decided not to pretend that the day wasn’t already full. He said his name. He said his captain’s name. He said the word food once and then again. He said the word control. He did not say sorry because the voice did not make room for it. He listened to instructions the way he had been taught to when someone who could keep you alive was speaking. He went to write down a name and realized he had already remembered it without pen or paper because it belonged in the column of the ledger where he would later put the words oxygen and rope and saw.

The night came slow and then not at all, the inversion refusing to let the sky do what it was meant to do, and the station lit itself as if it could be the sun. Harmon fell asleep on the couch with his hand in a bag of chips that had seen better decisions. Sosa texted a photo of Reyes’s name on the hospital board to the group chat and then wrote, All green. Oliver lay down on his bunk and did not try to count his heartbeats because he had done enough counting for one day. He put a bottle of water by his bed and a banana on the locker and felt foolish and like a man who has survived worse versions of himself. He closed his eyes and kept them closed, and though it took a long time to get there, sleep finally came, not like grace, but like a co-worker who shows up late and still helps carry the heavy end.Chapter 9

A week put a soft bruise over the city and called it weather. The inversion thinned and returned, discipline-of-air that made everybody talk like they were in church or hungover. Reyes sent a photo of his feet in hospital socks with the caption glamorous, and Harmon replied with a string of fork emojis because he had discovered the keyboard and refused to be civilized. The board at Station 3 showed a different handwriting for the daily plan—Sorensen’s blocky squares instead of Reyes’s neat lines—and it felt like waking up and finding someone had rearranged the living room while you slept and expected gratitude.

Sorensen was a captain out of 12s who had a mouth that went tight when he thought somebody was doing math he hadn’t approved. He collected them into the bay and ran through his philosophy with the bored efficiency of a man who had been in love with his job long enough to know love did not always look like enthusiasm. They would drill on ladders because the city had recently discovered gravity again; they would walk through a strip mall because strip malls hid spite behind empty leases; they would check their packs because checking was a friend, not an accusation. He handed Oliver the clipboard and said, “You’re running the entanglement prop. If anyone gets cute, untangle them with words before wire,” and then went to bully the ladder rack because it had been ten hours since he’d had the opportunity to feel useful with his hands.

The entanglement prop was a square of plywood and rebar and wires that had once protected somebody’s imagination from mice and now existed to mock the confidence of men who thought nothing would catch them if they stayed low and moved smart. Oliver set it up in the back of the bay, draped the snarl of wire in the humble geometry Jain had taught them, and went through the safety talk with a voice that sounded boring on purpose. Rookies from 21s came over sunburned from a fire the night before that had made a case of beer out of a shed and a boat; they cracked their knuckles like it was a spell and then listened because even men who believe nothing can surprise them have an instinct for traps that’s older than their appetites.

“Slow,” Oliver said, masking up because instruction meant nothing without humility. “Don’t let it convince you the only way out is fast. Breathe like your lungs belong to you. Think where the wire wants to live and do not offer it rent.” He crawled in and let the wire make its case and then contradicted it with care, breathing on a count he could have done in sleep, and when he came out he could feel Hunger watching him from the cool shade beside the rig, patient as a neighbor’s dog. He ignored it the way you ignore a friend you know will still be there in an hour and felt his stomach flicker at the insult.

They were halfway through humiliating a rookie who had tried to lift with his ego when the tone dug its finger into the room. MVC with entrapment, I-80 eastbound near Parleys, heavy commercial involved, multiple callers. Sorensen said what he always said—“We are not in charge until we are”—and then they were in the rig, moving, the bay a mouth that spit them into a road that liked to pretend it was a river.

The freeway knew how to host chaos. By the time Engine 3 reached the merge where the canyon unwound itself toward the valley, cars had already done that frantic, involuntary choreography people do when they realize manners won’t save them. A dump truck had tipped where the shoulder narrowed, bed twisted out of its usefulness, an ugly ladder of steel half off, half on. A compact car had tried to exist in the same space and lost. A van sat perpendicular across two lanes like someone had set it down that way to demonstrate a point about bad choices. The air smelled like brake pad and diesel and a new something chemical from an uncooperative load. Patrol had dented the scene into something that looked like an idea of control; their light bars made the gray feel like a club nobody wanted to be seen in.

“Two red tags,” the first medic on scene called as Oliver slid in beside him, his own gear adjusting to the noise like a coat learning a new shoulder. “Truck driver conscious, pinned by dash, leg trapped; sedan driver unconscious, major intrusion, no obvious chest rise, agonal once on our arrival. We’ve got a headache.”

Scene safety translated itself into cones and gestures. Sorensen split them without having to speak over wind. Sosa took the van with Patel and triage, Harmon and Oliver went to the sedan with the tools, and Sorensen went to the truck because command types liked to look a problem in the face and take a number. The sedan was white and had a child’s seat in the back that made Oliver’s stomach feel like he’d set it down unsteadily. The seat was empty and that could be mercy or timing; Patel’s eye flicked and Oliver felt the one quick nod that meant it would be checked.

They chalked the wheels and ate away at the driver’s side like it had been built with their tools in mind. The door had married the frame in a union that would not be blessed by any law; the glass had made an ugly fog of itself inside the car that dusted the dashboard in glitter that nobody would ever call pretty. Oliver took the spreaders, steel stupidly heavy in the way that reassures you, and set them just where the metal would have to give. He could feel the turn of his wrist, the pull in his elbow where yesterday’s saw had lodged its little complaint, the lightness in his forearms that told the truth softer than a shout. Harmon went to the other side with the cutter like a man invited to a dance he knew by heart.

He locked the tool and felt his body settle around it. The world narrowed the way it is supposed to when you do this right. He talked to his hands like they were old friends who had been ignoring him. The first bite of the spreaders was encouraging, the second demanded a story he didn’t have. His breath ducked and then came back; his vision pulsed once at the edges like a camera trying to find a subject in bad light. He gripped harder and the tool slid a fraction and caught again. He felt the first lick of panic, quick and mean, as if he had rounded a corner in his own apartment and surprised a stranger who turned out to be himself.

“Let me drive it,” Harmon said, tone low without being soft. His hand was there, a steadying warmth on the tool, not on Oliver, and the difference felt like a kindness he wanted to resent. Oliver held one half-second longer just to prove to himself there was nothing to prove, then ceded the mouth of the tool with a motion that tried to look like teamwork. He moved to the hinge and put his shoulder into the cheap choice that sometimes works anyway. The metal complained and then surrendered with a wet, ripping sound that had held its breath too long.

Patel’s voice threaded into the noise. “No pulse.” He did not say it twice. The word went through Oliver like a line drawn in chalk—the hard, stupid finality of it and the fact that it could be bent later by a hands-on argument for a minute or two and then not at all. They rode the door out of the way and Harmon set the tool down the way you do when it has just saved you and also betrayed you. They took the woman out fast and careful because the dead deserved both. Patel worked with the rhythm of exhaustion and hope, two minutes that stretched and then snapped, and someone handed a blanket across to make the world less stark in a way that fooled nobody.

On the other side of the mess, Sorensen had a hand on the truck driver’s shoulder and was telling him something that sounded like the truth without too much detail. Sosa walked a man away by the elbow in a movement Oliver had seen used on drunks and elders and children who would not let go of their trophies. Patrol shifted the cones and narrowed the road’s ambition. A wrecker idled at the far end like a farmer’s animal, hungry and patient. Oliver stood with his hands on his knees next to what had been a car and then straightened because you cannot bend in public for more than two seconds and keep your secrets.

He had the thought, brief and too bright, that if he had eaten the stupid other half of the muffin without making it a confession he would not have given the tool to Harmon. He hated himself for the thought while defending it and then setting it on a shelf because that would have to be a later fight. The coroner came in a sedan that looked too ordinary, the indignity of it always part of the day when this happens, and a patrol officer took a photo of the scene from a dozen angles like documentation would change the way the story told itself in everyone’s head. The child seat in the back held a small blanket folded perfectly into quarters, the most adult thing in the car.

They cleared piece by piece. The dump truck driver cried the way men do when they know the timing of their tears will be judged and cannot care. Sorensen signed a line on somebody’s form because days like this had forms. Harmon put the cutter back in the cradle and patted it as if apologizing for an argument. Oliver rinsed grit and glass out of the hinge eyes with a bottle of water and realized his hands were shaking only because the cap did not want to go back on and he could not make it obey alone.

Back at the station, Sorensen delivered the short debrief that acknowledged the obvious and did not attempt to clean it. “She was probably gone at impact,” he said, an honest line nobody should be sentenced to remember. “We did not make it worse. The truck driver will keep his leg. The freeway will be mad for a week and then bored again. Document. Hydrate. I’ll take the write-up for the fatality. You put a note in the book about the tool. If we need maintenance, I don’t want to find out because it got coy on us at the wrong time.”

Oliver dutifully wrote the note with his neat block letters as if the pen were a witness and needed to be comforted. He ate an apple without ceremony at the sink, the cold, sweet throw of it at the back of his throat making his eyes water. Harmon came and stood next to him and did not talk for a minute, which was the most generous comment he could have made. Then he spoke to the faucet. “You handed me the tool,” he said. “That’s not nothing. I’ve seen men marry them rather than give them up to the best hands in the room. That’s a compliment you are going to pretend you did not mean, because you’re you.”

“I was kind,” Oliver said, and heard it land and sound both petty and brave. He rinsed the apple core and set it on the counter and moved it into the trash because he could not stand it sitting there being both a decision and a piece of evidence. “The tool was humming too high.”

“Your hands were,” Harmon said, not landing the blow. “There’s a difference. Fixable. Not optional.” He knocked Oliver’s shoulder with two fingers as if the body were a door he didn’t want to use. “Sorensen’s going to file an exposure form for you whether he tells you or not. He liked what he saw and he’s a little afraid of it, which means you’re going to visit Clinic Lady, and she’s going to ask what you ate, and you’re going to tell her things that are not lies but would not withstand a cross. Do what you want with that prediction.”

The Clinic Lady was named Tamsin and she had a hair clip that looked like a tiny pair of jaws. She did not say food until Oliver said it first. She asked about lift loads and tremors and the white spark at the edges of his vision that came and went like a trick he had learned and now couldn’t stop doing. He told her about the granola bars he had in the pockets of his coats and about how they sometimes became ballast. He mentioned oats and the way bowls looked at him on mornings when the city started gray. He did not say the word hungry. He let her say it. It sounded different in her mouth, not an accusation or a diagnosis, just an object being set on a table where other objects had been handled and survived.

“I am going to be unromantic,” she said. “I will give you numbers and timing as if you were a baseball game. If you follow them, you will not get to feel heroic about starving. You will get to feel boring. Boring is the diet of longevity. You can also continue to make big gestures with ropes and cars while your blood sugar makes small ones in the background and then surprises you at exactly the wrong shop. Sorensen is asking for a consult. You and I are going to agree on a plan that will satisfy him and not insult you.”

He laughed because she had inherited Harmon’s strategy of refusing to make him special. She made notes, and he watched the pen move and thought about how long he had trained his body to obey rules nobody else had written and how a new set of rules would require a new kind of compliance. She gave him a list no longer than the time between tones on a quiet day: protein within one hour of shift start, salty carbs after extrications or extended drills, a thing that grows on trees in the middle of the afternoon as if he were a child who needed recess, water like he owed somebody money, a banana next to his bunk because sleep is not the same as suspended animation. She slid the paper across to him as if she were a dealer and he’d been playing a losing hand when the deck wasn’t stacked. He folded it small and put it in his wallet where other truths lived and forgot to come out.

Sorensen stared at him like a judge who wanted to be somewhere else. “Light duty for a week,” he said, flat. “Reyes will call me and thank me, and you'll hate me, and someone else won't get crushed because you got mad in the right direction instead of the wrong one. You’ll ride with Isabella and scare children by being charming. You’ll eat the muffins that look like they should be fed to rabbits. Then you’ll come back and I won’t have to babysit your pancreas.”

“Agreed,” Oliver said, because he could hear the tone of his own defiance and was tired of it. He wanted to argue about being useful more than he wanted to be useful and recognized the hypocrisy as if he’d been trying to pass his own deodorant off as a moral compass. He told Harmon in the locker room and braced for ridicule and got a bottle of Gatorade shoved into his hand, which was worse and better.

Isabella’s office looked like a donation drive had come to rest midflight and turned into a nest. Posters of cartoon flames promising to Stop, Drop, and Roll curled at the edges because the tape had given up trying to be immortal. Boxes of coloring books sat in siege towers on either side of the door. Isabella wore a peacoat and earrings shaped like little axes and had an energy that reminded Oliver of dispatchers—soft voice, steel spine, the amused patience of someone who had decided outrage was a waste of flashbulbs. She welcomed him with the kind of affection that made you understand it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with her insistence on building a world where friendliness did not get you killed.

“We’re going to Lincoln Elementary and then to a church in Glendale where the pastor has opinions about candles,” she said, flipping her calendar to show him a day he would not have chosen. “You’re going to be in a photo with a puppet that looks like a raccoon and not make the face yours is making right now. You’re going to tell five-year-olds to crawl under smoke and not sound like you’ve been down there for days with your own thoughts. Try to be tall and kind, which I assume you’ve already mastered.”

He was strange at first, the way big men can be when they forget to lower their voices for small rooms. The kindergartners smelled like glue and unshed tears and bravery. He held up the tiny smoke alarm he could have balanced on a fingertip and made the beep sound with his mouth because the teacher had asked and he hadn’t found a reason to resist fast enough. They practiced closing doors, tiny hands on painted wood, the solemnity of a ritual that would feel like a game until the day it didn’t. A girl in a unicorn T-shirt asked him if fire liked pink and he said it liked everything and that was why they did not let it pick its own friends. A boy with shoelaces that made a danger of their own raised his hand and said, “My dad says firefighters eat ice cream because they’re hot,” and Oliver told him that sometimes they ate soup and sometimes they ate sandwiches and sometimes they ate whatever life handed them that they had the decency to accept.

At the church, the pastor shook Oliver’s hand too long and told him about the Christmas Eve vigil as if a vigil could be negotiated with a lighter. The fellowship hall glowed with that old varnish honeyed by time and too many casseroles. A woman with hair the color of respectable silver arranged candles on a table with the focus of a surgeon. Isabella turned charm into legislation, walking the line between respect and insistence like a tightrope she had built herself. Oliver stood at her shoulder and nodded at the right moments and let his height be read as authority because people still loved the visual of protection, even when the protection they needed was a stern word and a metal snuffer.

On his lunch break he sat on a low wall near the west side rec center and ate the sandwich he had made and wrapped that morning. He did it without performing endurance and without wanting applause. It had turkey and mustard and a slice of tomato he had scolded himself into slicing. He watched a pickup basketball game bloom on the cracked court with the surety of a perennial. A boy in a Romanian soccer jersey drove past three men with the insolence of youth and put the ball up off the glass, and the whole group made that polite, surprised sound people make when talent catches them by the collar and reminds them it has no age. Hunger sat beside him and said nothing. They shared the bench without contest.

Lena texted a photo of a rusted truck in a field of cheatgrass that glowed like it had been invented to make painters feel original. The red rock behind it leaned like a shoulder. The caption read, Moab is a cathedral built by water. I keep looking up and forgetting to walk. He typed and erased twice, then wrote, Bring home something that isn’t a picture. A rock small enough to feel like a sin. A sentence your advisor will hate. She sent back a picture of her own hand, red dust ground into the crease lines, a palm you could read if you believed in that particular heresy. He held the phone and felt the gentle, unhelpful widening of his ribs that meant an emotion had asked for a chair and been offered a couch.

In the late afternoon, Sorensen stuck his head into Isabella’s office and did the thing men do when they don’t know if they are interrupting a joke or a crime. “Hospital wants visitors after seven,” he said. “Reyes nominated Harmon because he’s bad at mercy and will bully the nurses into falling in love with him. He also nominated you. I told him you had detention with Ms. Community Outreach, but she’s letting you go. Try to look poor and deserving. Do not make faces at any beeping equipment.”

Oliver walked up the hospital’s long hill like a penitent because that was how the grade made your lungs behave. The evening light did its slicking trick over the pavement, turning the walk into an exhibition in which he was only intermittently the subject. The U’s glass and angles knifed the inversion as best they could. Inside, the smell was industrial kindness and lemon. He found Reyes’s room down a corridor that had photos of the city pretending to be more evergreen than the economy allowed, and for a second he felt no urge to go in because he was unprepared to see a man he counted on reduced to parts. He went in because not going in would turn into a story about himself he was tired of telling.

Reyes reclined like a man who had made a deal with gravity and intended to keep it. A brace bracketed his lower back with the insult of efficiency. An IV line hung with the nonchalance of anybody who thinks it belongs. He looked as though he had been carefully folded and set down. He smiled in that meeting-in-the-hallway way he had that made even bad news sound like an agenda item he would love to table. “You look like you’ve been doing good deeds you didn’t choose,” he said. “Sit before you start apologizing. I’m fragile and compliments are heavy.”

Harmon occupied the visitor’s chair like he had stolen it. He had a plastic cup of something blue and the satisfaction of a cat that had found a sun patch. He got up without being asked and made a big production of replacing the chair exactly five inches to the left. “I’ve already told him about your handsomeness at children,” he said to Oliver. “He demanded proof. I described the raccoon puppet. He wept silently.” He put his hand on Reyes’s shoulder with the care of someone touching a lever he believes can still move the world and then left with the promise to come back and smuggle in contraband yogurt.

It was just the two of them, then, Reyes and Oliver, a room big enough to hold that without making their voices feel like trespass. The monitor made polite noises like a neighbor who insists they can hear your TV through the wall. Reyes watched Oliver for a moment like a man who had been given his friend’s face and was deciding whether it was forgery. “You gave the tool to Harmon,” he said eventually, and the word tool was a compliment that would have read as a command anywhere else.

“I did,” Oliver said. The words wanted to arrive decorated. He delivered them undecorated because that had been part of the bargain he’d made with the voice on the phone and with Tamsin’s precise list. “I am trying to share my toys.”

“You are not a martyr,” Reyes said. “It is possible to be competent without being delicious. You do not have to be eaten by the day to prove you belonged to it.” He shifted and the pain moved across his face like a shadow finding a wall. “You called the number on the pamphlet.” It was not a question and somehow not a surveillance. “Good. You will make a schedule out of being a human. You will follow it because you obey schedules even when you pretend the ink is a suggestion. You will forgive yourself when you miss a line. You will not confuse apology with logistics.”

Oliver stared at the brace as if it could translate. “You nearly got folded into a piece of furniture,” he said. “I keep thinking about your wrist in my hands. You weighed less than you should have.”

Reyes smiled with only one side of his mouth. “I would prefer to weigh heavy in your mind as a warning,” he said. “Not as an excuse. Food, water, rest. Air. The list does not change because we did a hard thing well or because the city forgot to applaud us. I will say it until I am hoarse and then write it on a whiteboard like an idiot’s version of scripture. Eat the rest of the muffin. You will get sick of that sentence. You will also need it. I refuse to haunt you if I’m not dead. It’s tacky.”

They spoke for twenty minutes in the way people do when they have both already decided how the conversation will be used later. They did not mention Lena, who had sat in this same chair earlier and said words that belonged to her. They did not mention the freeway woman beyond acknowledging that she had been and then had not been. They did not attempt metaphors for pain because the room already had a monitor for that. When Oliver stood to leave, Reyes squeezed his hand hard enough to be unmistakable. “Come back when my pain is funny,” he said. “We will make Sosa laugh and it will disturb the nurses.”

He walked out into the parking structure that had been made to confuse visiting relatives and stood a second to let the shape of the day settle on his shoulders. His phone chimed and he assumed the universe had no sense of timing and then looked anyway. There was no text from Lena, which felt correct and a little less like mercy than he would have preferred. There was a message from the number with the voice. Tomorrow, 0900, it read. Bring a snack you are not ashamed of. Bring a reason you won’t want to say out loud. He typed back, Copy, and the word wore the uniform it always did and made him feel safe in a stupid, necessary way.

When he got home, his apartment had the odd roundness rooms get after you’ve been living in public for too long and return with your elbows full of other people’s breath. He put a banana on the counter and did not move it to prove nothing to anyone. He took a Tupperware of soup from the fridge and warmed it and ate it without explanation. He felt the small tug between each swallow that asked him to apologize and did not. He put the bowl in the sink and ran water and then dried it and put it away because cleanliness was a different worship that did not need to be abandoned for this one. He lay on his couch and held his phone over his face and thought about hurt as a currency and decided he was broke. He put the phone down and watched the dark draw a literal line across his ceiling as a car outside moved its lights. He slept like work, waking twice and talking himself down with Tamsin’s numbers and Reyes’s face and the raccoon puppet’s stupid grin.

Morning made an effort. The inversion pulled itself thin as tissue. He set out at 8:20 with the small, silly backpack he used when he needed to convince himself he was leaving the house for school instead of confession. The clinic sat on 400 South wedged between a dentist who believed in murals and a plant store that believed in improbable ferns. Inside, a woman with a sweater that had seen better committees handed him a clipboard with the serene blankness of someone who has learned how to give strangers permission to change their lives without getting paid for the part where they decide not to.

Group was four people and a box of Kleenex and the sense that somebody had set the thermostat two degrees too warm on purpose. A paramedic from 9s named Halley with eyes like a sky threatening lightning said, “I don’t eat on call days because if I puke in my mask I’d rather it be bile than lunch,” and a forestry tech in a shirt that looked like it had been washed with rocks said, “If I fit into last year’s Nomex then I’m in control; if I don’t then the fire will know,” and a nurse from the cardiac unit said, “If I eat during a code again, I will count the chews and hate myself and the patient and the break room.” Oliver said, “If I eat on days we’re busy, I feel like I’m making a demand the city won’t respect; if I don’t, I feel like I’ve won an argument I shouldn’t have started,” and the counselor, a man with a listening face and the worst tie he’d ever seen, wrote on the whiteboard, That is probably the point, and underlined probably.

They talked until the room smelled like pencils and admission. Nobody did the thing where they tried to out-hurt each other. The counselor made them laugh twice on purpose and once by accident, and Oliver found himself liking the sound the way you like the hum of a truck you trust. He ate the stupid snack he had brought—a good hard cheese and an apple already cut because he knew he would talk himself out of it if he had to use a knife—and nobody clapped, which was the only way he could have stood it.

He left with a homework assignment he had not received since before he had decided to become the kind of person who only learns when dying is the quiz: write down three times in the next twenty-four hours when your body asked for something and you did not argue. Write down one time you argued and why it felt necessary. Make no promises in the margins.

Back at the station, Sorensen raised an eyebrow at the backpack and then at the banana on Oliver’s locker like he was being asked to join a cult that didn’t permit knives. “You smell like feelings,” he said. “Go hose off in the alley. After, go to Edison Elementary. Isabella needs your shoulders for a photo with the PTA. Bring me back a sticker that says I did a good job even if it is for six-year-olds.”

The day slid by on rails. He waited for the tone like a man waits for a judge and it did not oblige. He helped a fourth grader tape the corner of a poster so neatly it would have satisfied his grandmother. He carried a box of smoke alarm batteries to Isabella’s car and did not pretend the weight meant anything more than the weight. He answered a question from a man at the church who wanted to know if incense counted as smoke and said yes and no and let Isabella do the bit where she makes theology out of fan behavior. He met Harmon in the kitchen at the end of shift and ate the other half of the muffin without telling anybody but himself that it tasted better as conclusion than as compromise.

He walked home along 700 East because the light there behaves and because he needed a street that would not trick him. A skateboard clicked past with the rhythm of forgiveness. A woman carried a bag of oranges that looked like a bouquet. A child in a dinosaur coat stomped a puddle with both feet like a test and logged the result with the seriousness of a scientist. He felt, briefly and exactly, the way he had the first week he had worn a badge and learned that being useful and being seen were not the same thing. He whispered to the air, “We are not negotiating,” and did not immediately know whether he meant hunger or the city or the impulse that insists on standing at the top of the stairs counting the floors as if numbers could make you weightless.

That night, before he slept, he wrote down his three things on the back of a library receipt because paper is also a kind of promise. He wrote, Ate the sandwich outside at noon without hurrying; drank water after drill without telling myself it was weak; accepted the rest of the muffin. For the argument, he wrote, Almost handed Harmon the tool because I was afraid of being seen trying, then didn’t, then did for the right reason. He looked at the list as if it could become a diagram and folded it. He did not put it in his wallet. He tucked it into the book on the table, a novel in which a man fails to do the right thing six times and then does and nobody thanks him. He turned off the light and lay flat and let the night lay down on top of him with its reasonable weight. Outside, the city exhaled in traffic and small celebrations and the slurp of a bus emptying itself to the curb. He fell asleep on an even number and did not require the math to forgive him.
