The fog came in from the fjord like a careful animal, nosing its way between the low brick buildings and the glass monuments that had replaced the warehouses. It collected on Syd’s eyelashes as he stood on the pavement outside a pale green tenement in Tøyen and watched his breath turn white and disintegrate. He had forgotten gloves again. His hands hurt. He switched the paper folder from left to right and pressed it against his ribs as if the flimsy municipal logo could radiate warmth. He wondered if the woman behind the door would cry or curse or light a cigarette and stare at his badge like it would tell her everything he couldn’t.

“Ready?” Jens said, shifting from foot to foot. Jens’s cheeks were scorch-red over his beard. A smart phone glowed in his palm, reporting time, location, the fact that they were present and professional. The law was always a line on a screen before it was a knock on a door.

“Mm,” Syd said. He lifted his fist and knocked.

From somewhere down the hallway came the long-limbed music of a radio tuned between stations. Footsteps thudded, quick then slow, then the lock snicked and the chain was drawn.

“I know,” the woman said, before they spoke. She had a scarf tied around her hair, a dish towel thrown over her shoulder like a small surrender flag. “You phoned yesterday. And the day before.” She stepped back so they could see the hall and the living room beyond. Stacks of books. A fern that had not been watered in a long time but still clung on. “Do what you have to, boys.”

“Ms. Mathisen,” Syd said. Always the first person plural, always the soft tone that hid the steel tooth. “I’m Syd. This is my colleague, Jens. If you’ve got any last—”

“No.” She placed a hand on the wall and closed her eyes. “No there aren’t.”

They had done this before. And would again. Later, the report would say that Ms. Mathisen vacated the premises of her own accord. That the sheriff’s office was present to ensure order. There would be no line for the way she reached out to touch the doorframe as if wood could comfort, for the way she took one long breath and then another and smiled like a tightrope walker over a black sea.

“I’ve got enough on the trolley,” she said, nodding to a suitcase. “My son will fetch the rest.”

Even as she said it, some part of the future loosened, a thread tugged free. But those parts were invisible unless you believed in them. In the office they laughed off belief. You stuck to statutes and forms. Syd could do that. He could pull on the gloves he kept forgetting and slide knots into the world and call them folded fabric.

“Would you like me to call someone?” he asked, surprising himself. He always said it, but this time he meant it.

“No.” She worried the dish towel. “No, it’s all right. Funny, I thought a place holds you down. It’s really the other way around, isn’t it?”

He thought of his father, of a kitchen of his own childhood where a radio hissed and then the male voice turned a page. He thought of the day the staircase filled with boxes and a new pair of shoes lined up by the door. Not his mother’s. Small, white, careful shoes. His father saying, “We are going to try. We’ll be better together.” How to say yes to a promise that arrived on a Tuesday and smelled like hand cream and fear. How to say yes to a girl peaking from behind a sleeve and then pretending not to watch him watch her.

“It can feel like that,” he said.

They walked Ms. Mathisen down the stairs. Her suitcase wheels talked to the treads. In the courtyard the fog was thicker, as if it had pooled and settled. She turned left instead of right, toward the metro, then pivoted back, embarrassed.

“I’ve lived here twenty years,” she said. “Look at me.”

He smiled. But after she disappeared, the vacant flat’s echo had nothing to smile at, and the cold seeped into the holes people leave behind.

Jens cleared his throat. “Lunch?”

“In a bit,” Syd said. His phone buzzed in his pocket and he glanced at the screen, expecting his father—Stig always called at inopportune times—but found the name he was hoping for, and not hoping for, as if both were equally dangerous. Maren. If he typed I’m working she’d reply with a string of owl emojis, a private joke from a winter ten years ago when they’d thrown two pillows into the air and watched the feathers drift without a word. He didn’t know how to begin to describe how long a decade could be, how it could have the shape of a small city inside it.

He swiped, read. Brunch after your shift? The new place on Thorvald Meyers.

He typed back Yes too quickly and then deleted the word and sent Let me see if I can get free. He watched the dots blink and settle and thought he had become a man who was hungry all the time, and not for food.

At lunch, Jens wanted to talk about the match that night. Bodø/Glimt was a miracle and not a miracle, both at once, a freak run of green luck and a study in systems. They ate fish soup with bread that shredded into the broth like snow. The cashier had dyed orange hair and a nose ring shaped like a small crescent moon. He wanted to ask her if she knew anything about actual moons or actual magic or actual rings and he watched himself, briefly, from a height, a municipal man in a dark jacket with a soup spoon and a wish.

“Sorry,” he said after too many seconds of quiet.

“You’re never sorry,” Jens said. “You’re just listening to a radio I can’t hear.”

There was a story he could tell, how in the cabinet of his father’s living room had been a box of photographs and at the bottom of the box, under the photos, wrapped first in tissue and then in a strip of blue scarf, had been a ring. He could say that it had not been expensive—thin silver, a simple band—yet it had pressed into his palm with the gravity of a coin you throw and that comes back to you. He could say that they had been told not to touch anything, that the cabinet wasn’t theirs, that their new mother, Liv, had brought it with her when she moved from Kongsvinger. He could say that Maren had taken the ring, just for a breath, just to see how it looked, just to understand it. He could say that he had watched the way her eyes had widened and then narrowed as if she had received a small shock. He could say the ring went missing after that. He could admit he had not looked for it. He could say he knew where it was because he had seen the ring again, years later, glinting from a cup on her nightstand like a second moon.

He said none of that. He finished his soup. “I’m meeting Maren after,” he said, not able not to say her name.

Jens’s eyebrows did something that would have fallen under harassment policy if anyone had been keeping score. “Maren? Is she back in town, then? I thought she was going to be in Denmark for a year.”

“She came back early. Museum work. Grants fall through. The university shifts the paper around. You know.” He wanted to say her voice is the rain that brings a city into focus if you stand at the window long enough. He said, “We’re trying to stay friends.”

“Friends,” Jens said, making the word long, as if it could be stretched until it snapped. “Syd. My man. We have worked together five years. There are few facts in the world I know, but one is that you don’t do simple.”

“Thanks,” Syd said, dry. He met Jens’s eyes. “Your beard looks like a fox that died in the snow. You know that, right?”

“How dare you.” Jens laughed. “Okay, lover-boy. Go be friends. Don’t get fired.”

He walked to Grünerløkka. The fog had lifted to a kind of pale haze that made the world look slightly overexposed. On the tram someone had scrawled a crown in black marker on the back of a seat, something a teenager believed in. The doors hissed open and he stepped onto Meyers gate and into the smell of coffee that had made long alliances with memory. When he pushed open the heavy door of the café the bell tinkled a music that threaded itself into his chest like a tiny invasive thing. He flexed his hands.

She had already found a table near the window, her scarf tossed over the back of the chair, her hair pinned in a loose knot at the neck, the way she did when she had just showered and couldn’t be bothered. When she saw him she lifted a hand, half wave, half defense, that elegant shape he had seen in the mirror of his mind so long he could draw it with his eyes closed.

“Hey,” he said.

“Hey,” she replied, and the word did all the work two words like it never could. The remaining vowels between them were everything they pretended not to say. “I ordered for you. Sorry. The thing with the dill and the sour cream.”

“You’re a tyrant,” he said, sitting. “I was going to choose.”

“No,” she said, smiling. “You were going to deliberate until the coffee swooned.”

He looked at her hands. She had tiny nicks on her knuckles where paper had cut skin. A conservator’s wounds. She worked with maps that flaked like fish scales and tiny knives that coaxed stories out of gummed glue. He wanted to ask if stories ever come out whole. If saving a page meant saving the person who wrote it. If the person who found it later belonged to the person who left it behind.

“What?” she said, catching him.

“Nothing. You look—” He stopped himself from saying beautiful because the word had lost its boots, it didn’t walk anymore, it drifted upward and got caught in the wires. “You look like you slept.”

She laughed. “I slept.” After a beat, “I’m still staying with Mum for now. The flat is cold, you know how it gets. The radiators take a tantrum and we all suffer.”

“How is she?” he asked, carefully.

“Liv? Fine. She’s been trying new recipes. You should come. Dad would be—he would want you there,” she said, and smoothed the napkin with her already-smooth hand.

“We’ll see,” he said, because it was easy. He’d see. He always did. He was good at being the man who arrived with wine and left before the coffee.

The food came. It was good, of course. Something with dill. Something with sour cream. He ate and kept his head while hers turned toward the window, where a bike messenger balanced on a pedal at the light, a girl in a red coat leaned into the wind, an older man scolded a dachshund that had no patience for crosswalks. Every moment carried its own small held breath. He thought: if I could gather all of them. The almosts. I could build a bridge over anything.

“Do you ever think about Köpstad?” she asked suddenly, naming the summer village where they had been forced into siblinghood. Red cabins, a beach the color of unvarnished wood, the squeal of pines.

“Sometimes,” he said, with care.

“I keep seeing that night,” she said, and he wondered which night she meant. The moonless one with the bonfire? The afternoon when the four of them—Liv, Stig, her, him—had sat on the porch while it rained and rained and nobody had spoken more than yes and no for hours. The night when the electricity failed and they played cards by candlelight and he realized their hands looked alike across the table, the way they held their thumbs, the way they worried the corners of the paper.

“Which?” he said, soft.

“The storyteller,” she said. “The old guy. On the bank. Hair like a thistle. Mum had bought him waffles and he sat down without asking like the bench belonged to him.”

He laughed. “Håkon? Or Bjørn?”

“Bjørn,” she said, then shook her head. “I don’t know. He told that story about the ring. The one pulled out of the silt after the spring flood. The ring that knows. I’ve been thinking about it because someone brought in a chest last week, a family thing from Bispevika. There were papers. A scrap of velvet. Very old coins. A child’s shoe, if you can imagine. And a… well, not a ring. It was a buckle. Still. It made me think.”

The way the word ring landed on the table between them was like placing a coin and discovering it had a weight beyond the metal. He kept his breath even. The bell over the door tinkled. Laughter somewhere in the back. The scrape of a spoon on a ceramic cup. “Does the ring that knows… what did he say? It knows what you want or what will hurt you?” he asked, feigning lighter than lead.

“Both,” she said. “That if you hold it too long, it chooses. That it remembers your name and attaches itself. If you lie while touching it, it tightens. If you tell the truth, it warms.”

“That would be useful at work,” he said, and she smiled, her mouth making that precise shape he would not memorize again because he didn’t need to, it was already stitched into the lining of him.

“It would be useful everywhere,” she said. “But I’ve been thinking about objects, about how much we ask them to hold. We pin things on them. My old scarf holds a winter. A chipped mug holds a laugh. It’s not fair, to them. It wears them out.”

“People do the same to places,” he said.

She looked at him a long moment, then away. “I just thought it was a silly story when I was a kid. Now I wonder if we didn’t throw away something we needed by calling it silly.”

After coffee, after the logistics of departure were enacted in the ancient ballet known as the splitting of the bill, after she made a joke about him being a public servant and he pretended to be offended, they stepped to the street, into that pallid light that was not sun, not cloud, something in between as if the sky had not yet opened its mail.

“Walk with me,” she said.

“Anywhere,” he said and regretted the word the instant it left, because it was too large and too naked, but it came out seeming like an easy yes. They walked. He did not check his phone. He did not check himself either. Along the river, over little footbridges that made children skip. Past men fishing for vague things in murky water with complete concentration, a patience that would have cured a small illness. A woman pushing a pram and listening to a podcast about war. They stopped on a ledge near the waterfall and watched whipped white water fall as if the city owed a tax to the sea and was paying in foam.

“I missed this,” she said. “Being here. Having no one to ask permission of but me.”

“You always hated asking,” he said, grinning.

“Hate implies a moral stance. Mine is purely practical.”

A tram trundled over the bridge behind them. It sounded like a thought shaking itself awake.

“Do you ever—” she began and then stopped.

“What?”

“I—” She shook her head. “Never mind. I was going to be stupid.”

He waited. Telling her she was never stupid would be the wrong key. She needed silence to turn. She turned.

“I sometimes wonder what we became because of them,” she said, not needing to specify who they were. “The way we formed. It was good. I’m not saying it wasn’t. But we bent. You bent. I did too. Do you ever… want to look at the original shape?”

He thought of the box in the cabinet and the ring that was not a ring, and the way her breath had left her when the silver warmed. He thought of the moment at the lake when they had both held the same oar. He thought of the word step as something people say to avoid stumbling and how it made him want to run fast and not look at his feet.

“I don’t know if I have one,” he said. “An original shape.”

“You do,” she said. “You used to want to be a diver. Remember that?”

“Since when is a diver a shape?”

She laughed and the water found a second channel through stone. “Since always. You wanted to go down. To find things. Come back. Today you go down in other ways, bring back other things.” The laugh fell into quiet. “You were always brave without being dramatic about it,” she said. “That was your shape. I think. Sorry, I know: mush.”

“Mush,” he agreed, to save them both. “Like porridge.”

“Speak for yourself,” she said and turned away and he understood the conversation was over and something had been said in the not-saying that would not be unsaid.

He walked her back to Liv’s. The steps were damp. The brass on the door shone with the requirement of fingertips. He did not follow her in. She had not asked. Before she went she put a hand on his sleeve, a small, not nothing.

“Come to dinner tomorrow,” she said. “Dad would be offended if you didn’t.”

“Since when have we kept score of Dad’s offences?” he said. He wanted to reach up and take her hand and place it on the rail so it had somewhere honest to rest.

“Since always,” she answered. The corners of her mouth. “Seven.”

“What?”

“We were seven. The first bean soup.”

He had to smile. “I remember.” The beans had been on strike, the broth refused to be broth.

“Just come,” she said, quick now, backing away. “We’re making something edible.”

He watched the door until it latched. He stood for a long time outside, for no reason at all. Then he went to his own place, which was small and not unfriendly, with windows that faced a street that did not try to impress him.

That night, his father did call, right on time, and the conversation was a braid of groceries and politics and weather and something else, some friction that would make a sound if you touched your ear to the line carefully.

“You’re coming tomorrow,” Stig said, not asked.

“I’m coming,” Syd said, too tired to fence.

“Good. Liv has been experimenting. She made a cake last week that was… it was a cake.”

“I’m relieved to hear it.”

“Are you well?” Stig asked the way men do, three words packed with what cannot be unpacked in that format.

Syd considered. He had two glasses in the cabinet. He took one down and turned it in his hand like something you could use to see. “I’m well,” he said. “Work is a forest, but I’ve got a compass.”

“You always had a compass,” Stig said. “I borrowed it sometimes. I—” He stopped. “Old men talk too much,” he added, and then the familiar throat-clear. “See you.”

After the call, he sat on the floor and leaned back against the couch and let his legs stretch. He watched his own hands loosen. There was a book open on the table but he would not remember the page. He must have slept because he woke to half-dark and the sound of a car passing and a dream detail that stuck like a burr: a man on a bench, hair like thistle, holding out an empty ring box and laughing and laughing as if the joke was on the sea.

He found himself at the museum the next day, early, like a person who wants to say that something has pulled him without saying it. He called Jens and told him he’d see him later, there was paperwork he could do from the café near Rådhuset. Jens made a noise like a goat and let it go.

The conservators’ offices were bright with lamps and quiet with concentration. He stopped at the threshold and watched hands perform small surgeries on history. The shadow of the past was not romantic. It was dry. It flaked. It needed mending like skin. He understood it better than he had before.

She saw him. Her eyebrows lifted in a question. “I thought you had to…” she gestured vaguely, a half-formed legal term.

“Later,” he said.

“This place is boring,” she warned. “Paper is slow.”

“I’m slow,” he said. “We make a pair.”

They stood by a case that held a map of the old harbour, the outline of the city’s lung before modern lungs were poured and cured. She pointed to a note in cramped, slanted script that spoke of a chest borne up from mud. “People keep their lives in boxes,” she murmured, as if they didn’t both know it.

“What was in it?” he asked.

“A ledger. Buttons. A toy soldier missing an arm. A buckle. Bronze. Curled with verdigris like it grew there. And a letter.”

“A love letter?” he said, making it light again.

“A bribe letter,” she said, unexpectedly. “From someone in the council to someone who could swing a vote. Ah, we were good then, too.”

He laughed, low. “We are always the same, we just dress differently.”

She glanced at him, quick. “When did you get so old?”

“Probably right around the second cup of coffee.”

Later, after he had looked longer than anyone would look who didn’t have business there, he left and walked and kept walking. He took the long way to his father’s. He cut past the school where he and Maren had been strangers in the same building for two years, his father and her mother not yet entangled, their lives as parallel as tram tracks that had not yet curved. He walked through the park where he had watched her teach a borrowed dog to sit, both of them performing obedience with the same cheerful stubbornness. He paused on a bridge and watched the water and a gull that rode it like a commuter bored of his route but doggedly making it anyway.

By the time he reached Stig and Liv’s flat, the building smelled of cumin and patience. The walls held familiar noises. He paused at the door, listening. Someone broke into laughter. Maren. He felt his skin adjust to the ambient temperature of a place he had learned both to love and to survive.

“Come in,” Stig called after the first knock and the second. It had always been like that, as if he had been expected long before he arrived.

They were in the kitchen, of course. Liv in an apron that insisted on stripes. Stig with a wooden spoon like a baton, conducting something that didn’t much care for his tempo. Maren at the counter with a bowl, the precise sweep of a whisk. Three small and the rest large, their inner circles finding their orbits.

“There he is,” Liv said, warm. There was flour on her nose, an old trick. “You look skinny, Syd. Sit. We’ll fix it.”

“I brought wine,” he said, and set it down and received their grateful noises as if they belonged to someone else and he was just borrowing them.

Dinner moved on little rails. The plates arrived. The talk did what talk always does. You set it rolling and it rolled. There were cards and old jokes that had been sanded smooth by repetition. Liv insisted on stories about his childhood appetite. Stig insisted on asking about the football. It was late November and the city had begun to wear lights at its throat.

Maren leaned back in her chair and watched the three of them with an expression he couldn’t interpret. Not resentment. Not exactly. A sort of inventory. As if she was counting bolts before she climbed a wall. When she caught him looking, she made a face and then rolled her eyes for only him.

Later, when they were clearing, she followed him into the hallway. They boxed themselves in between coats that predicated winters and winters. The air smelled of wool.

“Thanks for coming,” she said. She bent to pick up a fallen glove. He watched how she moved, like every time she had to make up her mind to inhabit her own body.

“It’s not a chore,” he said.

“It could be,” she said, practical, then softer. “Do you want to walk? After? Or no.”

“Sure,” he said, then listened to himself and nodded as if to someone else. “Yes.”

They walked the perimeter of the blocks, the way you circle the pasture before you let the horses out. They passed a couple with a stroller and a dog, a teenager on a hoverboard, an older woman dragging a bag of bottles that chimed together like a made-up instrument. The sky had lost the last of its light. The air had the brave feel of cold that had put on its armor.

“I met someone,” she said, without any preparation.

He felt his pulse throw a shoulder against his throat. His feet kept moving. He was pleased with his feet. “Oh,” he said, as if she had told him about a new houseplant.

“It’s new. Stupid to say it out loud. Probably nothing. I just.” She linked and unlinked her fingers, that old habit. “I don’t want to not say it. That’s all.”

“That’s good,” he said. It was like speaking through cloth and expecting the words to make it across. He thought: I will be the good man. I will be him until my teeth crack. “What’s his name?”

She laughed unexpectedly. “You assume it’s a he.”

He left a space for her to correct him. She did not. “He is Sebastian,” she said. “I know. A melodrama of a name. He’s not. He is kind. He works at the pier, with boats, the parts of boats people don’t see. He smells like old rope and the sun. And he talks to people like they deserve to be spoken to.”

He could have said: so do you, at your best. He could have said: I am not those people and I do not know how to be. He could have said: if you love him I will know because the sky will move an inch. He said, the smallest thing. “Okay.”

She stopped. He had to stop. They faced each other under a street lamp that threw their shadows long and lank into a painting nobody would want to buy.

“You’re my favourite,” she said, abruptly, childishly, as if it could ward off a storm. Then, catching herself, she made a sound like no, like never mind, like sorry. “I don’t mean—”

“I know,” he said, and because his hands needed occupation he stuck them in his pockets and found only lint. “I know what you mean.”

She looked up at him and for a moment he saw the version of himself that sat inside her eyes, the one with a compass, the one who dived and surfaced and brought something glinting in his palm. He did not believe in parallel lives, but he believed in parallel rooms where the furniture was almost the same and the air smelled slightly of apples. If he stepped sideways he might arrive. If he opened a door.

But he didn’t. He walked her back. They did not hug. The city gave them a cold pat on the back and sent them to their rooms.

On his way home he passed a flea market still packing away. A woman coiled a string of lights into a bucket. A man folded a table into itself like a trick. There were boxes of books and boxes of silverware and boxes of things that did not belong in any box. He paused at a box with jewelry, mostly junk, the tin and the cheap gold that dulls against fingers that wash dishes without rings.

“Looking?” the woman asked, not unkindly.

“Just,” he said, and then his breath snagged. There was a thin band near the bottom of the box, half-buried under a string of pearls that would stain your throat green. It was not his stepmother’s ring. It was not any ring he knew. It was too simple. Too nothing. But something in it was familiar in the way the shape of a word you can’t place is familiar, like a name that eludes you all morning until it sweeps back long after you need it and stings you with its precision.

“How much for this?” he asked, aiming for casual, missing wide.

She reached for it, dug it out with a thumb and forefinger. “Fifty,” she said, then looked at him and rolled a small shrug. “Forty.”

He turned it in the streetlight. It was not silver. Not gold. Something between. It had a seam like it had been bent and joined again by a hand that couldn’t be bothered to make it seamless. On the inside, faint, as if someone had dreamt it rather than written it, was an etching. A curve and a line that could have been nothing or a rune he had noticed in one of Maren’s books. The sudden idea of calling her tugged like a hook. He pictured his own door. He pictured his own bed. He pictured a pocket with a ring in it that weighed more than its visible metal.

“Okay,” he said, reached for his wallet.

The woman watched him count. “This one’s older than it thinks it is,” she said, and he almost laughed, a bark that would have startled the pigeons under the eaves. “People always come when I put it out. They don’t all buy. You did.”

He held the ring and imagined it saying his name. It didn’t. It sat in his palm like a small moon and kept its counsel.

At home, he put it on the table and turned out the light and then turned it back on and then out again. On. Off. The metal didn’t glow. The inscription didn’t rearrange itself into meaning. There was no warmth except from his own hand.

“You’re a fool,” he said to the kitchen. He hid the ring in the drawer with the rubber bands and receipts and batteries that didn’t fit anything he owned. He brushed his teeth. He lay in bed on his side and listened for the night to tell him something new. It told him the radiator’s old story, the pipes’. He fell asleep and woke to a breath of air on his cheek that he could not explain. He sat up. The room held. The ring was where he put it. He was who he was. For now. He lay back down and slept again, rolled, dreamed of a bench and thistle hair and a voice saying, into his cupped hand, that there are debts that want to be paid in time and debts that want to be paid in truth.

He woke to snow. The city had done that trick it does, the one where it tucks itself under a white sheet and asks you to look again. He made coffee. He walked to the window with a mug and stood and sipped and watched the flakes adjust to the damp. He put his free hand in the drawer and felt for the ring like a person who knows where everyone is in the dark.

Later, on the tram, he held on to the metal pole and thought: you are not the sort of person who believes in rings that know. And yet the small weight in his pocket argued otherwise. He didn’t take it out. He didn’t need to. It was enough, for now, to know that he had made a choice he could not explain. It was enough to know that explanation is overrated. It was enough to hold on to a shape and wait to see what it would become.The snow did that trick where it made the city quieter without having to ask. Syd stood at the window with the mug against his mouth like a small, sensible animal and watched flakes choose their angles. He could name the kinds if he tried—wet ones that pasted, dry ones that skittered—but names didn’t help, they rarely did. He put the mug down and dug in the drawer without looking, his fingers finding rubber bands, a blister pack of batteries that looked all purpose and fit nothing, a scrap of a receipt that had faded to the color of old linen. The ring was exactly where he had left it and not exactly the same. It had acquired the knowledge of a night in his home, as if objects learned us the way we learned them. He put it in his pocket, not ready to put it on. The kettle clicked itself off and then on again, a finicky mood, and when the tram rattled past outside it seemed to rattle through him too.

Jens had dug out a hat that made his head look like a smart mushroom. He transferred a paper cup between hands and talked into the lid. “We’re short again,” he said without preamble, meaning staff and time and sense. The white on his beard gave him the temporary grace of a saint. “Two on the list for morning. One is a lock change in Bispevika, the other a night deposit at a shared office over in Vulkan if you can believe that anyone still does paper there.”

Syd nodded, startled by how adult the snow made everyone. “Bispevika first,” he said. The name put a shape in the air. Between the offices and the harbour, between the old docklands and the new esplanade, there would be cranes and the smell of water pretending to be steel. He said, as he always said when Jens’s eyes did that check-inside-your-head thing, “I slept,” and the metal in his pocket tightened in a way that made him stifle the easy habit of finishing the lie. It wasn’t a crushing, it was a contracting, like a hand remembering to make a fist. He swallowed, and the impulse to say more met the thin edge of his own pride. “Strangest dreams,” he added, and the ring loosened, a breath against his thigh, a small concession to the treaty he didn’t remember signing.

They took the tram east, then south, the sort of route where the city narrates its own progress if you look. New buildings in sheets of glass considered their reflections like people who have gotten the haircut they asked for and aren’t yet sure. Older ashlars sat beside them, not impressed and not offended. The fjord in winter didn’t know if it wanted to be mirror or slate; it practiced both. Syd watched two gray gulls hover at the lip of wind, riding a thing they couldn’t show anyone. He put his hand in his pocket and felt the ring waiting like a question that had been phrased too well.

The person in Bispevika was not the person he had projected when he saw the case file and the address. He had imagined a wealthy delinquent stubborn over principle or a shell company with a PO box that redirected to an empty room. The door opened on a workroom that smelled of tar and damp rope and time. A woman in a navy sweater stood with a fid in her fist, her hands as sure as fishermen and surgeons. She was maybe sixty, her hair in a short, practical cap, her mouth the kind that said the truth and regretted it after. Coils of rope were stacked from floor to shoulder; along one wall were belts and buckles and a few handsome, dangerous hooks like punctuation that could end a sentence if you swung it wrong.

“Aila?” Jens asked, already softening into the voice he used for people who kept knives and didn’t use them unless necessary.

“Aila,” she said, giving him the fact and then looking past both of them to the snow making lace over the window. “You’re here for the lock, then.”

“The landlord filed,” Jens said, showing the screen as if obedience could be softened by transparency. “We have to change. There’s a process.”

“There’s always a process,” Aila said. She set down the fid, a gesture so gentle it had a kind of love in it. “I told him the same thing I’ll tell you. I paid. It was late. I have the receipt. The machine swallowed the number. The bank says wait. He says out.” She smiled in a way that had no heat and did not need it. “I have rope owed to me in four boats outside, but rope doesn’t go to court.”

Syd felt the ring stir, a minor current like the first minute of rain. He met her eyes and everything in him wanted to lie the way a person does who is tired of the rules and the seeing what the rules do. He wanted to say we can wait, we can call it off, we can make this nothing. He had a public service badge and a stomach and they were not always colleagues. “We can call him,” he heard himself say instead, and there was a weight on that we that startled him. “We can ask for a day. Two. The office doesn’t like us to, but the office isn’t here and we are.”

Jens made a noise he turned into a cough. Aila watched both of them like owls watched snow. “Call, then,” she said, and lifted a coil of rope and set it down somewhere else because hands had to have jobs or they would start breaking.

When the landlord’s voice came through the phone, it was the voice of a man who could afford to be tired. He had the vowel smoothing of someone who had gone to the right schools and he used the word unfortunately as if it were a piece of cutlery. Jens did his dance. Syd did his. They played the chords of empathy and extension. The landlord said we’ve done all we can do and the ring in Syd’s pocket slipped and tightened, his body a diagram with one bright line. He put his hand over the phone and looked at Aila, then at Jens. “I can put in a report that suggests a mistake in the bank’s sequencing,” he said, feeling how the word suggests tried to make itself small. “It won’t stop the lock change if he insists, but it will slow it. And we can give you the number of a legal aid who knows the landlord act too well.”

“That’s not what you came to say,” Aila said, not unkindly, not triumphantly.

“It’s what I can do without losing the bit of power I have,” he said, and the ring warmed against his skin as if a hand had been pressed to the outside of his pocket. It wasn’t warmth like a stove. It was warmth like breath. It made the small hairs on his wrist notice themselves.

The call completed its dance badly. The landlord said no, then said maybe, then said he feared setting a precedent. Jens said the ceiling of his office dripped when it rained, which was true and irrelevant and also perfect. In the end, because everyone wants to believe they are a good person and the algorithm of their good requires a variable, the landlord allowed forty-eight hours for a bank to confess. Jens ended the call and put his phone face down on a coil of rope shaped like a sleeping question. “There,” he said. “A miracle on snow.”

Aila grunted. It wasn’t gratitude, exactly, and it wasn’t its opposite. “I can fix the netting on three boats in that time,” she said, calculating. “If any of you fish, I expect a discount.” She paused, eyes narrow. “What’s in your pocket?” she asked Syd, as if the question had a thingness to it she could pick up and splice.

“Lint,” he said, automatically, and the ring bit, a neat, corrective pain like a tack finding a heel. He inhaled, caught, and then did the oddest thing. He told a stranger the truth. “A ring I don’t understand,” he said, and the bit eased as if he had taken his foot off a pedal.

Aila tilted her head and examined his face like you examine a work you didn’t make but would still be held responsible for if it failed. “Then don’t lie to it,” she said, as if she were telling a boy about a boat that would throw him if he tried to pet it the wrong way. She picked up her fid and set its point under the strand she was splitting. “Men have ruined themselves lying to wood and metal. Don’t add your name to that shelf.”

Outside, the fjord made a noise like someone sweeping. The snow didn’t stick on the promenade but it collected in the dips of the old cobbles and brought out the memory of horses in the city’s joints. Jens walked with his hat pulled down and his mouth set in a shape that meant he would tease later and was thinking now. “Since when do we do custom charters?” he asked finally, and there was no bite to it; he had given Syd forty-eight hours and would not count them against him.

“Since always,” Syd said, and surprised himself that it was true. Their job had in it more priest than cop and neither of them had wanted that but here they were, with hands that learned to bless in the guise of filling out a form. He wanted coffee and a simple decision. He got coffee and the ring, heavy and light at once, like a coin he had placed on one of those balances in a museum, the kind where someone else’s coin on the other tray made both sides stand at attention.

They ate a small thing in a place that had figured out how to steam milk into a cloud without the pretension of naming it. Jens did most of the talking and all of the listening in that way he had, which was a talent he pretended was a joke, and nothing they said about the match scheduled or the weather had anything to do with the way Syd’s pocket pulled his attention like a proximal magnet. He excused himself and stood in the bathroom, that humming room where the mirror always suggests the possibility of confession, and took the ring out and looked at it. Under the white light, the seam was more visible, a joining that didn’t pretend to be artistry. The faint mark inside the band wasn’t a letter he knew. If you stared you could make it into many things. He had long practice at staring that turned into a shape he could carry.

On the way back to the office, he sent Maren a message that said, I have a strange thing to show you if you want to be bored in a professional way, and then put his phone away so it couldn’t ask him to watch it. He expected an answer when his hand was busy with something else, and he got it under a street overpass where water made biology on concrete. Bring it. Are you free at three? He typed Yes without deleting it. Some battles didn’t deserve to be fought twice in one week.

The museum in winter was a mammal conserving heat. Doors let people in like breath and kept them like lungs. The conservators’ floor made a person walk quieter without signs. Maren was at a table with a lamp clipped to the edge, a small sun tamed. On the paper in front of her someone two hundred years ago had written a list of amounts with a hand that didn’t know it would be kept. She looked up when he came. She did that thing where she made a smile happen in three places on her face at once and he felt the snow inside him melt and then freeze again.

“You brought the boring,” she said. Her fingers were blue with the short gloves she wore to keep skin oils from interrupting history.

“I brought the boring,” he agreed, and he put the ring on a square of gray foam as if it required the courtesy of a presentation. It was almost silly. It was also inarguably not silly.

She bent. She bent the way she had as a kid to look at a snail, respectful like the snail had a schedule. “Hm,” she said, which was one of her preferred instruments. “Metal is… not precious. But not junk. Alloys sometimes act like people. Stubborn or kind depending.” She turned it with tweezers and he felt a reflex in his fingers to interfere and had to invent a reason not to. “The mark—” She angled the lamp and then pulled a magnifying lens over it until the ring lay like a moon in eclipse. “Could be a bind-rune. Or a maker’s mark leaning toward witchy because it looks better that way.”

“Witchy is a professional term now?” he asked, because his jokes were sometimes bridges over the wrong river.

“It is when I say it is,” she said, and grinned without looking up. “I’m thinking ‘othala’ for heritage, property, that kind of stable. But the cross stroke—it’s slanted. And there’s a hook that looks like ‘laguz’ for water. Someone had fun, or someone wanted a thing to do two jobs, or neither and I’m making stories, which is often the most irresponsible job around here.” She touched the metal with the tip of a gloved finger and drew back a fraction. “It’s warm.”

“It’s been in my pocket,” he started, and then stopped because the ring was warmer than his skin had been. It wasn’t hot. It was awake.

“Mm,” she said, and he watched the word reach around her thoughts. “It’s also—” She exhaled. “You know when you touch paper and it’s been touched too much? There’s a residue of attention. This has that. Like it’s had a job for a long time and no one told it the shop closed.”

He thought about the buckle from the chest and the bribe letter, and the idea that objects were asked to hold more than their share. He would have said something like that if they had been alone in that room. They weren’t. A man stood at the doorway with a box, a man with forearms that had seen sun in months that hadn’t had any, a man who smelled like rope and weather and a little like citrus because people are never their jobs entirely. He was handsome in the way competence is handsome when it isn’t trying to be. He looked at Maren and the room got an extra piece of furniture she didn’t know what to do with.

“Sebastian,” she said, and looked at Syd as if S was a letter he might like to sound out. “You two should know each other, if only so I don’t have to do this thing where I explain you in two directions. This is Syd,” she said to the man, and then to Syd, “this is Sebastian, he helps us not drop the past back into the water because he actually knows how boats work rather than only how to draw them.”

Sebastian put the box on the table with care and made a hand ready to meet Syd’s. They shook like men who didn’t want to hurt each other and could. “Nice to meet you,” Sebastian said, and there was no performance in it at all, which felt like some sort of performance to a brain that had known too many performances.

“You too,” Syd said, and the ring stayed neutral, a Switzerland he had not known it was capable of. He was surprised at the rush of relief he felt over a piece of metal not punishing him for a basic social contract. “What’s in the box?” he asked, because the box contained the possibility of a narrative that was not his.

“Heartwood from an old keel we lifted,” Sebastian said, and the way he said lifted made it both a grace and a theft. “Plus some nails too beautiful to rot. You don’t often get those. And—” He glanced at Maren. “And a child’s shoe that looks like a joke except time doesn’t bother with those.”

“People drop pieces of themselves and expect the water to keep the secret,” Maren said, half to the ring, half to the wood, all to herself. She looked up and the look was like a window shading and the room making itself one degree warmer. “Do you have time? We’re going to the pier to catalog more as it comes. There’s coffee that tastes like someone boiled a boot and pretended it was a bean.”

Syd should have said he had a shift and a colleague and a job that kept finding his hands even when he hid them. He wasn’t wearing the ring, and still he heard himself say yes. The ring answered in his pocket as if it had been invited without asking.

The pier lived a different city under the city. Palettes turned into paths. Men and women in drysuits made the particular jokes of people whose lungs had learned fear and friendship both in the same hour. A gull stood on the corner of a crate and regarded their human fuss without malice. Sebastian slid a coil of rope into a shape and shrugged it over his shoulder; the movement was precise and occurred with no extra words. He and Syd walked awkwardly together in that way where you want very much not to be measuring, and so find a ruler in your hand anyway. They stopped at the edge where the gray water made its shoulder and the world smelled like old wood and new ambition.

A diver was up and peeling herself out of a skin that seemed glued. Her hair was a matte crown from the cap. “You got anything sexy?” Sebastian called, and the diver snorted and lifted a crate and set it down like she could hear their bones. Maren appeared at an angle, her breath making ghosts. She reached for a bag and pulled out something that had been wrapped in cloth so long the cloth had decided to be the thing. She unwound it inch by respectful inch, and when the last layer fell back there was a bangle of metal big enough to be a bracer and too small to be a collar, verdigris like a field on it, a notch like a bite in one side. Syd hadn’t realized he had been holding his breath until the sound of it leaving his body reminded him he had lungs.

“That,” Sebastian murmured, and he didn’t have to finish. It was a ring that had been a ring before rings had been gestures and promises and up-sold romance. This one wanted knuckles and oath-swearing and someone’s hand with a cut on it.

“Oath-brace,” Maren said softly. “Or part of. These were used on altars, the sagas say. Men put hands on them and said words they meant to mean. I love it when we find the part an old story was built out of. It’s a relief. It’s frightening.”

The ring in Syd’s pocket pushed through the fabric with its insistence very gently, like a mind returning to a problem. He put his hand there, and something like a line connected the two metals and made the hairs on his forearm rise into a weather of their own. He had never been a man who believed in the touch of objects. He was starting to wonder if a person could be converted by accumulation.

He did not intend to put his own small ring near the old big one. But proximity had a logic that didn’t consult him. Maren, still unwrapping the last stubborn bit of fabric as if unwrapping was a kind of prayer, looked up and saw the way his pocket had learned a shape. “Syd,” she said, curious rather than alarmed. “Will you?” She held out a hand and he handed what he had found to the person he had found first and it made a kind of grammar you could diagram if you cared to.

She placed the thin, odd ring inside the curve of the oath-brace and the moment had nothing dramatic in it except the human witnesses. There was no click. No sound. There was a sense of alignment that made Syd’s throat remember that sometimes you swallow because your body wants you to be quiet for a second. The smaller ring did not move. The larger did not react. Maren breathed. Sebastian did too, but differently; he had the practiced patience of a man who had waited at the surface staring at a white nothing until a black dot appeared and became a head, then a face, then an old friend.

“It’s nothing,” Maren said first, and then, “it’s something.” She looked at the mark inside the thin ring and then at the notch in the large. “A piece,” she said, maybe, possibly, and then put both hands down on the foam like a person in an old church putting palms to a pew that had been a tree when a different language was spoken. “We should test it,” she added, straightening into the scientist that lived in the same house as the witchy. “Light, metal composition, comparative analysis.”

Sebastian laughed, the sound very small and full of relief. “She means we’ll put it in a machine and think about it for three weeks,” he translated for Syd as if he needed an ally in the face of time. “Which is the correct thing. Correctness is a boat that doesn’t leak.”

“And you like boats that don’t leak,” Syd said, finding the crossbar in a conversation that could have turned to four corners without him. He meant it as kindness and found he meant it as half an apology, which the ring in his pocket acknowledged with a warmth that felt like acceptance and a warning both.

They stood there longer than necessary because necessary had always been a bad clock. When the cold insisted, they returned the things that had survived to boxes lined with materials that would not take more from them. Sebastian’s hand brushed Maren’s wrist once near the tape, and it was nothing, and it was the kind of nothing that could balance a world. Syd put his hands in his pockets and found there was not enough space for them and his thoughts and the object that had decided to live there.

He left them at the museum with their machines and their competence and their unadmitted belief. On the way down the wide steps he thought of how he used to run them three at a time, of a summer he had spilled an ice cream there and cried like someone had insulted his best friend, of the winter he and Maren had walked up those steps together and argued without anger about whether a map was a story or a lie. He wished for a second that he was simple. Then he wished for nothing at all because wishing had begun to feel like bad signage.

Jens had left him three messages composed mostly of muffled hallway sound and the word “report” used like a brick. Syd stopped at a bus shelter that had been sprayed with a stylized raven and told his phone the state of Aila and the state of the landlord and the state of his own soul in a code that read like a form. If the ring could hear it didn’t comment. He wondered what would happen if he said out loud the things he refrained from saying because the grown man in him enjoyed having a job and a bed and a father who thought he might be all right. He pictured the ring tightening, imagined it biting like a dog trained too well. He pictured it warming and tried to imagine what truth would deserve that.

At his father’s door the snow had already melted into middens of blackened edges and a child had stamped his name in it, a kind of claim that melted and was no less a claim for it. Liv answered, flour constellation on her cheek, the apron stripes announcing cheerfulness as policy. “Two dinners in one weekend,” she said, surprised and pleased and already moving toward an extra plate in her mind. “We’re not built for such luxury.”

“I’m not here long,” he said, and then, before it could be thought a weapon, he added, “I wanted to ask about something stupid. Or not, you’ll tell me which.”

“Stupid is dear to us,” she said, and tugged him into the kitchen where everything made more sense. “We’re marinating something that we’re pretending is meat, don’t look at it too hard. Stig!” she called down the hallway, “we have a son and a question.”

Stig emerged wiping his hands, the domestic king with a towel instead of a scepter. He looked at Syd the way he looked at weather reports: with respect and a belief that he could take what came. “You look like you’ve found a thing,” he said, because fathers have to invent omniscience to feel like they might get this done.

“In a box of junk,” Syd said, and saw something cross Stig’s face so quickly that the body would deny it if asked. “Not your junk. A flea market. Do you remember—” He swallowed. “In the cabinet. Years ago. The ring. The silver. Liv’s.”

Liv put the plate down in the exact wrong place and then moved it to the right one as if it had always been going there. “Ah,” she said, the vowel carrying a continent. “I wondered when that would resurface, like a glove you drop off a dock and hope the water takes.”

“I didn’t mean to—” Syd started, and the ring in his pocket warmed so quickly he had to stop to consider whether it was warning him from the way he had chosen to lie to himself about this. “No, I did mean to bring it up. I saw something that made me think of it. I wanted to know if it mattered. If it still matters.”

Stig sat. It was the kind of sitting that was a decision. He rubbed the part of his nose that always itched when he thought about money. “We lost it,” he said. “Or it left us. Liv brought it when she moved, and it came with the box of photographs and the scarf from your aunt that made your mouth itch, and the silly crock with a duck on it. It was her grandmother’s. It wasn’t valuable like the kind you sell and buy a couch with, but it had… it had held promises, I think. I didn’t understand then. The way things can hold what we ask them to hold.”

“I took it out,” Syd said, because he had decided somewhere between the pier and this table that cowardice would not be his coat for the evening. “I showed it to—” He stopped. He could say your daughter and be accurate and untrue. He could say Maren and the ring would decide. “Maren put it on for a second. I thought it looked good on her. And then it went missing, and I didn’t look hard enough.” He waited. Waiting was a new practice. It felt like standing in a snow field with nothing to point at.

Liv, who always took the shortest path to the place no one wanted to be and made them tea when they got there, nodded slowly. “It mattered,” she said, and it hurt no one that her voice did not hurt them. “It mattered because of what I had asked it to hold. Not because of what it cost. I wanted a thing from my mother in a house where I kept nothing else of her. I wanted a ring to be a bridge so I didn’t have to build one from scratch.” She smiled then, crooked. “That’s not fair to bridges. Or to rings.”

Stig had his elbows on the table, his hands clasped in a way that made his knuckles look like small white boulders. “We should have asked you to help look,” he said, and the simplicity of it was indecent in how good it felt. “We acted like it was our house and you were a guest with socks on your feet and that was wrong. That was my shape then. I hope I have a different one now.” He looked at Syd in a way he rarely did, as if his son were not a figure in his story but a story that could unspool and surprise him.

“It turned up,” Syd said and watched the sentence with the kind of horror a man might watch a train he is not on. “Years later. At Maren’s. On her nightstand.” The ring in his pocket warmed and did not tighten and he realized he had cut himself open in a place that had not bled in a long time. “I didn’t say anything. I thought I didn’t have the right.”

Liv sat down across from him slowly, as if she had decided the ground wanted to be made a part of the conversation. She put her hand over his wrist, a thing she did rarely and with reverence. “We swallow the wrong things in a house,” she said, and it was so practical that he could have wept. “We keep quiet to keep peace our invented way and that is foolish peace. I’m not angry with her. I don’t know if I am angry with you. I’m sad for the version of us that thought we had to behave like that. I will ask her about the ring. I will be kind. If you want to be in the room, you can be. If you don’t, I won’t punish you with our presence.”

“She told me a story about a ring that warms when you tell the truth and tightens when you lie,” Syd said, and his father barked a laugh and then fell very quiet, and Liv’s eyes soaked it up the way cloth does when you spill milk and then stand there.

“There are altars with oath rings in the sagas,” Stig said after a beat, the part of him that had collected useless facts all his life producing one that had learned to be useful. “Men swore on them and were believed or they weren’t, and either way the ring didn’t move. But men did.” He rubbed his nose again and exhaled as if each of them were candles he could not decide whether to blow out. “I am too old for magic,” he added, and then ruined his own statement by looking into his son’s pocket as if expecting to see light.

After he left, the evening cored itself out into that particular hollow that follows family talk done okay. He walked in snow that was making gray soup in the gutters and watched his own feet because the city had decided to hide its edges and he had fallen enough in his life to respect cold water that doesn’t look like anything. The flea market was gone, no trace, as if the tables and the people folded themselves back into whatever cupboards they came out of. A boy slid across a patch of ice on purpose and his friend followed and their laughter shot up and pinged the underside of the sky. Syd put his hand around the ring like a man who didn’t yet know his own reflexes.

At home, he put it on the table again and sat in a chair that didn’t know whether to creak and let it be quiet. He was tempted to say something out loud to the metal as if it could negotiate. Instead he took a bottle cap and flipped it, heads meaning nothing, tails meaning nothing else, and when it landed and skittered toward the edge and didn’t fall, he laughed. Then, because experimentation is not always a crime, he slipped the ring on his finger, the left, because the right had a scar he told people was from chopping wood and was actually from being twelve and not wise. It went past the knuckle easily, like a secret entered. He waited. His hands looked like the hands of a man who used them the way he ought, which was not quite true and never would be.

“You don’t do anything,” he told the ring, and then, because he had learned a little, he added, “yet,” and the band tightened fractionally, a reminder that the word yet was a kind of lie and a kind of faith. He felt foolish and then didn’t. He felt like a boy in a room with a candle telling the dark his name and listening.

He tried small things because the large ones had teeth. “I don’t like herring,” he said, and the ring warmed, complicating him with its belief. “I loved her,” he said, not specifying and knowing exactly who he meant, and it warmed again, not more, not less, as if all truth cost the same at this small shop. “I will never interfere,” he said, and the band tightened as if it had been waiting for him to be that stupid. He yanked at it and it did not want to come off, and he felt, very precisely, like a man on a dock with a rope around his waist he had forgotten was attached to a boat that had decided the tide was going. He inhaled through his nose like his father when he didn’t trust his mouth. “I will be careful,” he said, and the ring slackened the smallest bit, as if that was a bargain it had been made to respect.

When he slept he dreamed of a table in a longhouse he had not been to and of a ring too thick for anyone’s hand sitting in a pool of torchlight like something that had learned to wait before men learned to promise. In the dream, the thistle-haired man sat at the edge not touching the ring and grinned at him with a mouth short on teeth. “You can’t get out of a pattern by pretending it isn’t there,” the man said, and pushed across the table a wooden bowl that contained sand. “Draw yours. Then we can talk about erasing.”

He woke with the taste of smoke and old beer in his mouth and another small bruise around his finger where the ring had tightened and then forgiven him. He made coffee not because he needed it but because the ritual wrote the day ahead in a script he could read. On the tram, a teenager with a crown drawn on his bag slept with his mouth open, his dreams in plain view and unknowable. An older woman in a fur hat studied her reflection in the black of the window and moved her mouth around words only she required. At the stop near the office the driver announced that there would be delays and people said the things people say when confronted with systems and their humors, and the city shrugged into its Monday.

At the desk, Jens had brought a doughnut cut into quarters to pretend he had brought many. He ate one quarter and left the rest to fate. “We’re back at Aila’s in the morning,” he said, “and there’s a notice went up on a Populus forum about one of our officers exercising unusual discretion. I think they mean you. I told them to spell unusual with a z.”

Syd smiled and then didn’t, and then did again completely. He read his emails with a finger lifting and falling on the trackpad as if he were playing a small drum, and when his phone pinged with Maren’s name he opened it like a person who has left a window open and expects the weather. The message was a photograph of a page from a book, an oath ring in a church on Iceland, men in wool that looked like clouds holding hands over it. Under it she had typed, Don’t go swearing on household objects. They hold grudges. He typed back, I’ll leave the toaster out of it, and then, after a moment, added, Dinner last night was the past and a decision. Liv was kind. I was clumsy. It balanced. She sent three dots and then, eventually, Okay. I spoke to her. Bring wine next time that isn’t trying so hard. He laughed in his chair and Jens raised his eyebrows like scaffolding and then forgot to be a scaffold because a woman walked in with a plastic folder clutched to her chest and the sort of dignity that made all of them rearrange their faces.

By late afternoon the snow had decided to be rain. The ring had decided to be only a ring until he thought it was not and then it was something else. He walked out into Sinsen and then back again because there is a kind of walking that allows a man to remain still. When he reached the river, the water had turned the shade of coin metal and tiny bits of ice banged themselves into the bank like a conversation that needed a third person. He thought of the binding of the letters inside the ring and the notch in the larger, older one and a word that had slid into his mouth in the night and sat there like a pill you are told to swallow dry. Debt. He wasn’t sure yet whose it was. He had a suspicion that the ring would put him into a room where the question could be asked with doors closed. He wasn’t sure he could stand in that room and say anything at all. He put his hand in his pocket and felt the thin metal wait with the patience of a stupid animal that, left to itself, could start a fire. He stopped on the footbridge and watched a man down on the lower path teaching a boy to resolve a knot, their four hands a small machine. The boy laughed when it came undone and the man, without looking up, laughed too, as if the river had suggested it and they agreed.By the morning the snow had surrendered to water and the city had re-buttoned itself into grey. The gutters hosted a slow parade of street–made continents, the tram wheels cut dark crescents on their routes, and the gulls had returned to their ordinary arguments over nothing that sounded like everything if you were tired. Syd woke to the smell of wet wool even though he had not hung anything to dry, and put his hand on the bedside table as if he had left himself there. The ring had marked his finger faintly, not the indignant red of a rash but the pale collar left by a watch you forget you wear. He checked his phone and it was full of small requirements. He checked his pocket and it was full of one requirement he didn’t know how to name.

At the office, Hanna had placed a memo on his chair in a way that meant it wasn’t quite his yet and she could claim it back if he pretended not to see it. The memo had the tone memos get when someone above someone above Hanna has decided to aim a spotlight at discretion and call it shadow. There were concerns about procedural consistency. There were words that wanted to be cuffs. When he took it to her door she did not look up right away, she let him stand and feel the small heat of the radiator and the slow cold of his own error.

“You exercised judgment in Bispevika,” she said finally, reading from a screen but not reading. “The landlord alleges you spoke beyond remit. There’s a thread on Populus calling you a soft-hearted radical, which I think is an upgrade from fascist bureaucrat, but I’m not sure my contract covers the irony.”

“I did what we do,” he said, and the ring warmed once, a small pulse like a nerve. “Jens was there. We argued for forty-eight hours. It kept a woman working. The statute allows for reasonable delay when a banking error is probable.”

“We don’t define probable,” Hanna said. She had learned to make her glasses perform disappointment, a neat trick that became part of her face over time. “We don’t define reasonable. We administer it.”

“If we don’t define it, someone else will,” he said, and felt exactly the sort of person he used to roll his eyes at on television and very much not sorry. “The law isn’t an oven, Hanna. We don’t set it and walk away.”

For a beat she looked like she would smile, and then the job returned to her like a collar. “Aila called, actually,” she said, and the syllables came out like marbles she hadn’t expected to find in her mouth. “She thanked the office. She said you didn’t lie. That’s her phrase, not mine. It was very pointed and I decided to be flattered on behalf of the institution.”

“I make it a hobby,” he said.

“Don’t,” she said, but it wasn’t a threat. “A warning will live in your file for a period of time both defined and indeterminate. You can write a response. I expect you to. Use the word rationale, not the word heart. Go to Bispevika, finish it. Whatever it is.”

He nodded and left and in the hallway Jens leaned against the filing cabinets as if they were a bar in a club the two of them could not afford. “Is she a person today or a machine?” he asked.

“A person printing,” Syd said. “It’s fine.”

“It’s not fine,” Jens said, and then shrugged at his own reluctance to be noble on a Monday. “You’ll live. I’ll bring ridiculous pastries later so you can perform gratitude.”

At Aila’s the snow had either dissolved or gone underground and the smell of rope was all salt and sleep. The coil stacks had shifted since last time, the careful arithmetic of a tidy mind. Aila herself stood by the window with a mug that could have drowned a mouse, and when she turned her smile came in reluctant and left generous.

“Later today the bank will confess it is a bank,” she said. “Forty-eight hours is forty-eight hours. I can count like a grown woman. But I wanted to say this now so I can do the hard thing later. You told the truth when you didn’t have to. You told it to a man who was practicing being a wall. It won’t save the next person or the next. Do it anyway.”

“We’re supposed to ask you to refrain from making statements that could be construed as direction,” Jens said, looking at his screen to give her fair warning. “I won’t write any of that down because my fingers will fall off.”

Aila lifted the mug in a toast to the regulations that kept people warm. “I made a piece,” she said, and pointed to a length of rope whose splice was so seamless it looked like the tree it once had been had decided to give birth to itself. “It is a trick you can only do if you tell the rope what you’re making. It’s not superstition. It’s respect. You can’t lie to things that hold you up.”

He felt the ring acknowledge her and had the odd urge to put it on the table like you put a dog down to meet another dog, noses and tails and discovery. He didn’t. He watched her hands and thought how many kinds of work taught you the same lesson with different tools.

They changed the lock. The bank had called with a correction and the landlord had allowed himself a little exhale into the phone that wanted to be magnanimity, and the office would later enter it into the ledger of good outcomes as if there were such a ledger and if there was it obeyed math. When Aila turned the key in her own door and then set it in the small dish where keys always go in rooms that have learned a life, she looked at them like she was thinking of saying something that would turn into a joke if they weren’t careful.

“I had a ring once,” she said instead, surprising herself. “A real one. A circle made by a man who said a word and then left the other words unsaid. It was not made from metal. It was made from thinking I was alone in a house built for two. I keep it in the bottom drawer. Sometimes I try to wear it and the day ends badly. That’s not your business. Here we are anyway.” She tapped the dish with her finger and then she went back to the rope because it was a task with answers.

The afternoon limped and then found a stride. The city wiped its nose and pretended to be a place where nothing rotted. Around three, when the light had already begun to audition for evening, he walked to the museum with the ring in his pocket and a feeling like he was outfitted with a piece of equipment he would not be allowed to use in competition. The security guard had the face of a philosopher who had been told to be a gate. He nodded like they were both failing at pretending to be their uniforms.

Maren met him with her hair knotted and a pencil behind her ear, the prop of a profession that had survived the death of pencils. She led him down a corridor where the paint had learned patience and into a room where machines made hums that could have been invocations if anyone believed in that. The ring sat on a black pad under a light that made everything look forensic.

“We did quick,” she said. “Then we did careful. It likes iron more than it ought to. There’s trace silver where there shouldn’t be, unless someone down the line got fanciful. The mark inside is not a simple bind-rune. It’s a footnote. A carver copying a thing he half understood and making it part of the story because that’s what we do. Look.”

She showed him an image on a screen, the inner band magnified until it looked like a road in a country that didn’t exist. The mark was a curve with a cross stroke that tilted, a hook that suggested water, a small nick that might have been accident and might have been intent. The machine had layered the spectrum of its material like an onion that resisted being cut. She pointed at the peaks, the valleys. “Our best guess: a craft shop in the last century making modern affordances out of old shape. Someone had access to older metal. They melted it and mixed it, the way people mix families and think they can keep everyone’s name legible. It’s good work. It’s not nothing.”

“Can not nothing be the thing holding you,” he said, and the ring on the pad had no opinion.

She laughed. “That’s the line the grant committees love. We’ll put it in a brochure under a photograph of the fjord pretending to be glass. The big brace,” she added, pointing to a separate set of images and then at the thing itself lying like a sleeping animal on its foam, “refuses to be dated politely. It’s older than the docks where we found it. It was moved. That happens. You think you know where history sat and then it stands up and takes its stool with it.”

Sebastian came in with a smell she later told him was fish that had seen better days and old varnish and the sweet of wet leather. He was carrying a coil and a grin and he set both down with equal care. “Come see what pretended to be a crate until I tapped it and it confessed to being a door,” he said, not to anyone in particular, and then smiled at the two of them in the way of a man who had decided that four eyes were less trouble than two.

They went. He led them to the back where the newest arrivals lived before they got names. On a table lay a panel of wood thick as a wrist, iron straps fixed across it, a keyhole wide as a coin, edges chewed by water. Maren ran her fingers along the grain without touching it, the way a singer hovers over a note before she decides to own it. “A ship’s locker,” she said. “If I were a contraband in the nineteenth century I would very much like to be locked up in you.”

“It looks like it already was,” Sebastian said, and with a twist of a tool that could have been a flower if you were sentimental he lifted one of the iron straps and an old smell came up into the room like the bottom of a drawer you only open when you move house. They all breathed and regretted it and breathed again because regret isn’t a survival plan.

Inside were compartments and inside the compartments were nothing like treasure unless your treasure chest had broad categories. Bits of glass stopped being bottles. Tooth of a comb. Nail of a door. A coin you would refuse in change. At the bottom a scrap of blue. Maren lifted it with tweezers and a patience that could have built cities. It was silk once, now thread and wishes. She smoothed it against the foam and the room leaned toward her like people in a pew when someone stands.

“I know a scarf like that,” Syd said before his mind had time to be careful, and both of them looked at him with professional interest that spilled into personal because that’s how life and work lay on each other.

“Liv had a scarf like that,” Maren said, the way people say you can see the weather coming in over the ridge, and for a second the museum collapsed into a hallway in a flat with a cabinet full of history and a boy and a girl not yet the names they used. The ring in his pocket warmed the way a stove does when you stand too close. He inhaled and made the air go somewhere useful.

“Blue was cheap in some years,” Sebastian said, gently, and you couldn’t tell whether he was being kind to history or to the two people in the room who knew what this blue meant. “A rag can live a hundred lives. It can be a dress and a flag and a bandage and a promise. We’ll ask the dye if it wants to tell us where it’s from. Some dyes will talk if you put them under a light and offer them a drink.”

They catalogued until their backs told them what time it was. When they were done he followed Maren to the corridor where the air changed from close to ordinary. At the doorway she put her hand on the frame because people did that in older buildings without meaning to.

“Liv asked me about the ring,” she said, not looking at him and looking at him so hard he felt it. “The silver one. I told her I took it. I was sixteen and I thought it made me braver. It didn’t. It made me a thief. I put it back a week later because I wasn’t brave enough to keep feeling like that. It went missing a second time some other day I can’t put my hand on. I did not take it then. I don’t know where it is. That’s a bad explanation and the right one.”

He waited. The ring warmed, once, like a yes.

“I’m sorry,” she said, and there was a tiny smile in it only because apology without humor becomes a knife you point at yourself. “I would have told you if I knew when to tell you. That’s a stupid sentence. There is no when. There’s only the day you decide to do it.”

He nodded because it was what you give someone when they tell you they have been carrying a stone for years and they could use a free hand to set it down. “Thank you,” he said, and he meant it and the ring let him know it believed him. “Liv said she wanted a bridge. It’s not fair to bridges to use them like that. We said the same sentence in two rooms without offering it a chair.”

She made a small noise that contained too many feelings to list. “Sebastian is—” she began, and then, because she had begun, finished. “He is a person I can walk next to without narrating the entire street to myself as if description could keep me safe.” She looked at him as if he were a page she had to decide whether to preserve. “I don’t know what you need me to say here.”

“Nothing,” he said, because he was learning what damage the wrong word did, and his hand closed around the ring in his pocket as if he could hold in place the part of him that wanted to spill. “I need us to be not unkind.”

“I can do not unkind,” she said. “I can do that very well.”

On the tram back he saw his reflection in the window stutter with the pixelation of reflections that don’t seek to flatter. He looked older than he thought and younger in places he didn’t trust. A boy with a crown drawn on his backpack boarded and sat opposite and fell asleep with his chin in his scarf and the faith of children on public transport. Syd felt the ring turn around his finger by nothing but the drag of fabric and realized with a small shock it had climbed there while he had been looking at wood and silk and a woman’s face. He slid it back into his pocket because suddenly he could not bear to wear it like a sentence.

At home the lights outside his window made their low hum. He took off his jacket and stood in the kitchen like men do in kitchens when no one expects them to perform. The toaster looked innocent. He spoke to the ring because silence had grown teeth. “I am not going to be a man who uses metal to make decisions for him,” he said, and the band did not tighten. He waited, and it warmed the way a hand does on your shoulder when it’s telling you to stand up straight because the photograph will last.

Stig called in the way of a man who has learned that the timer on the oven and the phone are cousins. He asked about weather and policy and whether the meat had tasted less like ambition this time. He mentioned the council subcommittee in the tone of someone who wanted to be an informed citizen and had chosen the wrong river to wade in.

“There’s a man on it,” Stig said, “who has opinions about Populus and men like you exercising judgment. He is the nephew of a name in a ledger that made a bit of noise in the seventies when someone found coins in a chest that were meant to be counted somewhere else. It all blew over because everything blows over if enough men in ties stand upwind. Don’t tell Liv I said that. She believes in wind.”

“What’s his name,” Syd said, because the city had started changing when people named things out loud and he wanted to be part of that weather.

“Mathisen,” Stig said, and then said, “no, you look at me like that with the wrong part of your face. He is not your Ms. Mathisen’s relation. We checked once when we were all being better people than we were. This is a different one. They come in flocks.”

“Everyone comes in flocks,” Syd said, but under the joke something aligned. Bribery in a letter pulled from water. A ring quietly insisting. A landlord who said precedent like a man saying the word flood. He put his hand to the glass. It was cold the way it ought to be and he appreciated the consistency.

He slept badly and dreamed a little. The thistle-haired man was on the bench again, his knees making angles. He had the exhausted cheer of a sailor who has told a story too many times and is telling it again because the story wants to live. “Draw your pattern,” the man said, as if they had been mid-conversation all his life, and pushed the bowl with sand toward him. Syd put his finger in it and drew a circle and then a line across the circle like a bar through a letter. “Ah,” the man said, satisfied. “You want out by walking through. That works for men who think doors are better than walls. They are not always. Sometimes you have to learn to be a fish.” He laughed at his own mischief and the laugh had salt in it. “Truth is not a weapon unless you sharpen it. Then it cuts your hand very well.”

He woke with his mouth dry and the ring not on his finger and his arm asleep from being thrown over his head in defeat. He made coffee and wrote the response to Hanna’s memo with words like rationale and discretion and community impact and watched how language tried to put a tie on the parts of himself that refused to wear one. At the bottom he wrote something plain: I do not believe in the cruelty of systems that cannot be bothered to name their own choices. Then he deleted it and then he put it back, because he could live with a bruise.

Populus, that neighborhood of sentences where everyone performed concern in their dialects, had bloomed a thread overnight under a photograph of the oath-brace. Someone had posted a very clean image and a very dirty caption about promises and what it meant to keep them. Underneath a user named Kvast quoted sagas none of them had read and another one named Rune, of all things, wrote: oath-breakers in boardrooms look very handsome in suits. The comments went on, jokes with teeth. Someone brought up the old letter stuck to a ledger that mentioned a vote that had not gone the way it should. Someone else pointed out a family name that reoccurred at parties and on plaques. It was not journalism. It was something else: an old woman’s murmur in a kitchen, a boy’s shout on a frozen pitch, a museum label someone had rewritten with a pencil and a nerve.

In the afternoon, Hanna called him into her office with the peculiar calm of someone who had decided to tell you something you would like and to take credit for it. “The warning is a caution instead,” she said. “External pressure reversed itself because the landlord’s PR person wants to be photographed helping the small, honest trades of the city survive winter. There will be a blog post with a photograph of the rope and a comma used incorrectly under your name. I would like you not to enjoy this.”

“I don’t enjoy blog posts,” he said, and the ring kept its counsel.

When he left, he texted Aila to warn her about publicity and she replied with a three-word poem: put me last. He thought of the order of things in a sentence and in a life, subject and object, verb trying to be brave. The man in his dream had asked him to draw a pattern. He drew a line in his mind between a room with a blue rag on a table and a flat where a woman had needed a hand at a door. It crossed somewhere over water. He suspected he was not the person to make maps.

If he’d been a different person in a different book, he might have stood under Maren’s window like a man in the wrong decade. Instead he did the reasonable thing and brought Liv a loaf of bread from the good bakery because wheat felt like a peace offering older than they were. She let him in with flour on the back of her hand because she had decided to dust the kitchen table like a stage and she insisted it made the dough behave better. Stig had the news on low, the news had everyone on high. There was a recipe on the counter written in a script that had learned to take up less space than the writer wanted.

They drank coffee that had learned kindness and ate slices of the bread that made the knife grateful and talked about nothing until Liv couldn’t any longer. “He told me,” she said, and there were not enough characters in the universe to write all the pronouns that had to carry their age. “You told him. I am equal parts glad and a little ill. Maren says she’s sorry and that she has been a very brave person trying to do brave things with silly tools.”

“That was me before it was her,” Syd said, and Liv laughed in spite of herself, a bubbled sound like water escaping from under a lid that fits too well. “We asked a ring to hold a bridge. We should have hammered the planks ourselves.”

“You were children and we were children carrying paperwork,” Stig said, because he had a talent for indictment with a joke for a handle. “If we get a second go at this I would like to read the instructions and still ignore them.”

Liv went to the cabinet and came back with the blue scarf that made your mouth itch if you bit it on a dare. She held it up against the light and the thin places admitted to their thinness. “I keep it for the hole,” she said. “The hole is the most honest part.”

When he walked back across town the sky had come down until it could share secrets. The river had the slick surface of a lie too easy to tell. He stood on the bridge anyway because it was the sort of place men go when they have something heavy in their pocket and a story that wants to make a shape with their breath. He took the ring out and held it over the water like a person conducting a small, private trial. It warmed and did not tighten. It did nothing a sane person could tabulate. He thought of the bribe letter, and the family name that swung through decades like a bell that refused to crack, and a bracer in a box that made men put their hands down and mean the noise they made, and he understood in a way that was not intellectual why people had needed to put metal into rooms and tell it to hold them to account. We are so poor at it with our own hands, he thought. We are too fond of rehearsing.

The next day, Aila’s name slid through the office like a fish. A camera crew had turned up because the city’s appetite for stories that made it look good had been whetted. She would be on a local site, telling a reporter about rope while the reporter nodded and thought about dinner. Syd stood by in case anyone wanted an official word and only citizens required in the background, captured in the wide shot like spare punctuation. Aila looked into the camera and refused to perform gratitude. “We are all held up by what we make,” she said simply, and the ring warmed and he could have kissed it for its consistency. After, the reporter asked him to describe how it felt to exercise compassion within the constraints of the law and he smiled with seven teeth. “Procedure exists so that we don’t have to invent the rules every morning,” he said. “Human beings exist so that we don’t have to forget why we wrote the rules.”

On Populus, Rune posted a scan of the bribe letter they had bothered to find and a name circled in red. Under it the comments bloomed. Someone wrote oath-breaker, someone else wrote accused, a third wrote descendant, and a fourth wrote give him the same ring. Syd thought of the brace in its foam, of the way the small ring had sat inside it like a child in a grandmother’s lap, of how the bench in his dream had a bowl with sand and the ring with shadow, and knew that if he took what was old and pressed it against the face of what was new his hand would be bitten and it would be his own doing.

In the museum, Maren called him to see a thing the machine had decided to say. The dye in the blue rag had confessed to a certain decade; the silk had whispered of a shop that had existed on a corner that no longer had corners because the street had been widened to allow more cars to forget people. They traced it on a map with their fingers, stupid children in a house that had been leveled, and then drove there like adults pretending they did not care if the past breathed through a crack. Where the shop had been was a pharmacy with a bell that sounded counterfeit and a woman at the counter in a white coat that wanted to be believed. They bought lip balm and asked for nothing else because what would you ask? Do you stock a salve for rings that want something you aren’t sure you own?

Sebastian joined them with a stride that suggested strength was best expressed in the feet. He watched them ask a street for a favor and he did not mock them for it. “Tomorrow they’re lifting a piece of a jetty that’s been pretending to be bedrock,” he said to Maren, and the way he said it was private and plain at once. “If you feel like watching men bring old wood into air it was not designed to meet.”

She said she did and in saying it wrote a sentence in a chapter she had not shown Syd, and watching it made his face feel like he had been out in wind too long and whether or not that was true the ring did not interfere. After Sebastian left she turned and leaned on the car as if standing upright required a wall. “This is a bad way to say the thing,” she began, and he felt the ring notice her careful, “but we are at a preface and I don’t know how long Sebastian wants before he turns the page. I want you there when it’s a book. If you can be that person. If you can’t, I’ll ask you to stand at the window and wave at us as we go to the parade.”

He looked at her and saw the child in the kitchen with the radio hiss and the map-girl with knives the dew of the morning on them and the woman with a ring of her own, invisible and true, and he understood that there are times the form matters. “I can stand,” he said. “I can wave. I can drink the beer after and say the right thing. If I can’t on a day I’ll tell you and we will behave like people who know a bridge when they see one.”

She lifted a hand and made that shape he already had in his bones and let it fall. “You don’t have to punish yourself for the word loved,” she said, almost amused. “It’s not an infection.”

Back at the office, Jens handed him a page printed with names and dates and a small rant in the corner in Hanna’s hand that said watch your mouth. “They’re convening a hearing about procedural drift,” he said, the way you would mention rain. “We will be asked to memorize the language of neutrality and say it back while a man eats his sandwich. I thought you’d like to know so you can either sleep or stop sleeping.”

“Is Aila called?” he asked.

“She is not,” Jens said. “She will turn up anyway and sit in the last row like a cliff. She will not say anything and will be the reason any man in that room tells the truth on accident.”

The hearing was in a room built to look serious. The wood paneling had a shade that someone had chosen after thinking about walnut for eleven days. The chairs made people sit as if their mothers were watching. Hanna performed like a person who had been to the theatre once and learned that pauses matter. The committee’s faces had been taught to prefer tidy sentences. They asked Syd why he had called a landlord and connected that call to the fire alarm on the wall and the exit sign. He answered and did not perform remorse. He mentioned reasonableness and errors and forty-eight hours as a number that existed in the world outside of their policies. He could feel the ring on his finger in the way you feel the reluctance of a glove that doesn’t fit quite right.

One of the men asked if he believed in precedent. He had the sort of mouth that said he liked the word as a hat. Syd said that he did and that the precedents he wanted to set involved human beings remembering that paper had grain and tore. He surprised himself by not bleeding. When the questioning ended, a woman at the end of the table who had been silent cleared her throat and asked a thing no one ever asked. “Would the result have been different if the person had been less likable,” she said. “If the rope had been a different kind of rope?”

Syd looked at her, then past her, at the last row where Aila sat with her hands in her lap like she was containing a sea. “Yes,” he said, because you cannot protect yourself with your own lies and keep a ring on your hand. “We are mammals. We pretend we are machines until the moment a person blinking in the wrong way cracks us open. I try to be fair before I am kind. I do not always succeed.”

The woman nodded like someone had finally admitted to owning a clock. The ring warmed and the warm saved him from the cold he would have felt after those words if he’d been alone. When it was over Jens said a thing he couldn’t repeat and Hanna pretended to look angry and didn’t quite.

He walked home across a city trying to put away winter and not yet allowed. On a bench that he did not mean to pass, a man with hair like a thistle sat in profile and laughed at nothing. The bench had no sea; the laughter did. Syd stopped because he had to. The man turned and his face was no one’s and everyone’s and he held out a ring box the way a child holds a bug to his friend. It was empty and in the empty sat every yes a person has said and regretted and every no a person has said and regretted and a few that had been perfect and still hurt. Syd sat. He felt like a small boy and a man at once, which, he was beginning to suspect, was the only honest way to be.

“You want to know where the debt is,” the man said, not asking. “You think it is in a ledger with neat columns. It is in a woman’s hand on a doorframe and in your foot hovering over the first stair and in the pause between did you sleep and I slept. Put your hand in your pocket, boy. Keep it there when you talk. That’s how to pay. Don’t spend your truth all at once. Coins are heavy and make holes in trousers.”

Syd laughed because laughter disarmed the kind of fear that sits on a stool and watches you. “Who are you,” he said, and the ring tightened the tiniest bit because names in stories are both keys and locks.

“A man who tells the same story until someone sells it to him,” the man said, and grinned in a way that showed how few teeth a person needs to be useful. “Go on. There’s dinner to be botched somewhere and a woman with a map who can find you if you stop trying to hide in rooms with windows. And there’s a boy going to put his hand on a piece of old metal and feel the heat and decide to tell the truth about a letter. You can stand there when he does it or you can read about it later with your mouth full of bread. I am not your father. I will not tell you which is better.”

He got up and the bench got older again and the city returned to the business of marinating its buildings in weather. Syd walked because walking was the only tool he trusted. He had thought the ring was a thing that wanted to bind him. He was starting to suspect it was a thing that wanted to teach him to bind himself to what he already believed and had been pretending not to for the sake of neatness. He sent a message to Maren that said, Will you be at the pier for the jetty, and when she replied with a yes and a picture of a bad coffee he sent a picture of Aila on the hearing bench that made her look like a saint and a threat at once. She wrote, I like her, and he thought: I am learning to like who I am next to the people I like. The ring sat on his finger and did not complain.

The lift went slow in his building. It always had. On the landing the bulbs had that quality of light you forgive because someone is trying. On his doormat lay an envelope without a stamp and his name on it in a hand that his hand recognized from every card he had ever kept. Inside, on a cheap sheet of paper torn from a legal pad, were two sentences in Liv’s neat that leaned in the direction of hope. Found the silver ring under the dish with spent matches. I am not proud of any of us and I am very proud of us. He stood in the hallway and read it twice and then a third time because some mean part of him didn’t want to let joy be quick. He unlocked his door and placed the note on the table next to the ring he had found and stood looking at the two rings like a person in a museum who has stumbled into a display of his own heart.

He slept that night with both on his palm, one cold with the ache of years, one warm with whatever it was, and dreamed of a room full of people who had decided to tell the truth to objects they had made so those objects could tell them to keep going. In the morning the city had become a different city again because it always does. He put on the ring he understood less and slipped the silver into his pocket, and went out to watch men lift wood out of water like they were bringing a body to be named. He went because he had had enough of reading about things. He went because sometimes showing up is the only spell that works. He went because there was a debt that wanted time and a debt that wanted truth, and occasionally they wanted the same kind of coin.7

They lifted the jetty when the light was the color of old bone and the water had the sulk of a child asked to share. The crane arrived disguised as a casual monster and unfolded itself with the babyish patience of huge things, and men in yellow helmets consulted one another with the body language of geese on a lake, agreement arriving in ripples. Maren stood at the rail with her gloved hands in her armpits, the stance of someone who has trained their body to listen to cold without obeying it. Sebastian moved among the crates and slings like a person born to triangles of tension; ropes went slack when he looked at them and taut when he raised his chin. He greeted the crane operator by a nickname the machine seemed to recognize, and Syd watched how competence made small countries around it, how everyone who entered suddenly spoke the same language.

They had already laid out their saints. The foam pads like altars were tidy and expectant. Aila had come early, uninvited, as predicted, and stood with a mug that exhales in winter as much as any human does. She had combed the fringe of her hair with water and her fingers, a styling choice that left dignity intact and explained nothing. When Syd came up beside her she tilted her head toward the water the way a person introduces you to a relative you cannot see. He felt the ring register the line of the crane’s hook and the wood beneath, something like a recognition that wasn’t human and wasn’t not.

“It doesn’t want to come,” Sebastian said, not to be poetic but because the machine sang differently when a thing clung. He signaled with his hand and the diver down on the raft responded with the tiny wave of a swimmer who trusts you and the physics you claim to understand. The hoist cable tightened; the jetty resisted; the fjord had hands you could not account for; and then a bubble of gas like a prehistoric sigh reached the surface, and the water grew a hump as if remembering how to be animal. The dark wood rose, furred with weed and time, iron straps studded along its back like vertebrae, and everyone made the small sound men make when something ancient consents to be seen.

They laid it down on the deck and the deck made the creak of an old house greeting new shoes. Sebastian squatted and pried at the weed with a blade that had the shape of a fin; his forearms bristled with hair that had known sun in other months. He glanced at Maren with the look men give women when they are about to perform a task that requires both strength and deference. She nodded, and he slid the blade under a clot of weed and loosened it from its idea of belonging, revealing a plank face scarred and also exact, score marks where a saw had taught it the first grammar of usefulness.

The ring on Syd’s finger warmed in a way that felt personal without being possessive, and he had the unhelpful thought that if it had a mouth it would be saying his name only to see what happened next. He kept his face plain. A journalist with new boots watched from behind a cordon and adjusted the scarf that did not match his coat, preparing to narrate other people’s purpose to people who would be eating soup while they listened. Aila placed a gloved palm on the wood as if it were a chest and used the same force she would use on a human sternum to determine whether the ribs beneath would give her an answer. “Alive enough to be mistaken,” she murmured, and it was impossible to tell whether she meant the wood or herself.

It was Sebastian who found the iron set into the underside of the jetty where a ladder had once greeted feet. He tapped and heard a sound that distinguished itself from the chorus of iron with a tone that had learned to be listened to. He slid his blade and lifted, and a plate showed itself, an oblong the size of a child’s hand, held by two rivets that had been peened with a pride someone would have gotten in trouble for. The letters on it were a shallow relief, and when the slime had been wiped with a pad and a moment of cruelty, the stamp of a council seal from a century ago looked up with the smug of officialdom that had survived more than one regime of men in good coats.

Maren bent to read the words and kept her breath off the surface without thinking about it. “Rådstuen, 1911,” she sounded out, and then a line that had been hammered with care: property of city; for the public good. The phrase lay with the silt of irony on it and did not apologise. Sebastian laughed through his nose in the friendly way carpenters do when a plan betrays them, and traced the circle of the seal with a fingertip that left a cleaner arc.

Syd felt, absurdly, like the metal in his pocket and the metal under their hands were passing notes. The ring warmed at property and calmed at public good, and he hated and loved that he could tell. He ran his tongue along the back of his teeth to give his face something to do. Aila tilted her head and studied the plate with the same sad ardor she might have used on an old friend’s news. “It was always ever for everyone until someone needed to make rent,” she said, and nobody disagreed because disagreeing would make the day polite and skinny.

A strap cleat came up from the side like a fossil of a knuckle and caught Sebastian’s glove as if a person had put a hand out to shake and then remembered too late that their grip was bad. He swore without heat, tugged, and the glove tore, the iron giving him a delicate slash on the fleshy pad below his thumb. The blood bloomed quick and bright, surprised at itself, and he stood very still in the way men do when they want to give gravity time to reconsider. Maren was already reaching; she had a little roll of tape in her pocket and a square of something that had never met skin and therefore respected it. “Don’t pretend,” she said, and held his hand, steady as a prayer. “You can bleed and still be handsome.”

He grinned because his face obeyed her. He watched her smooth the tape and then flexed. “I need to be able to tie,” he said, and Syd stepped in without thinking, his own hand finding the rope as if it had once been a friend and was now a little offended nobody had called. Sebastian saw and passed him the line with a nod that was not a challenge and not an abdication. “Half hitch to the second loop and then turn it into a clove,” he said, and Syd’s fingers remembered a summer with a Scout leader who had smoked pipe tobacco that smelled like toast, and the rope accepted his effort because he did not try to move it faster than it wanted to go.

They worked like that for a while, three people in a triangle, the crane and the jetty making the fourth, and the world shrank pleasingly, which is one of work’s better lies. When the wood lay in its second bed and the men on the far edge of the pier began to pretend to get in the way of the camera crew so they could be asked to move, Sebastian leaned against a bollard and pretended to be less tired than he was. Maren watched Syd coil a slack tail and shook her head with a fond grimace. “I forgot you could be useful,” she said. “It’s a terrible oversight.”

He let himself grin. He had once been the sort of boy who needed to be told he was good at practical things because he tended to catalog the impractical and thought cataloging itself was a job description. He had not mislabeled the package; he had simply forgot that his hands had learned a language nobody encouraged him to speak. The ring on his finger obliged with a warmth not unlike approval, and he resisted the urge to give it the finger of another century.

Canteen coffee at the pier was as bad as promised, which made their table private because nobody lingered over it. They sat in their damp, the three of them radiating a smell that was not unpleasant if you liked truth. The window made a painting from the cranes and the low sky and the men on the far raft refusing to do physics badly. Aila had refused hospitality and left to feed coil to coil and story to story in her shop. They spoke in the tense after-work voice that keeps the world to its proper size for a few minutes more. Sebastian asked Syd about the hearing in the way people who do not live in rooms with microphones imagine microphones; he imagined theatre and moral clarity and not the grinding punctuality of phrases like “procedural drift” and “remit.” Syd told him what he could and omitted the joke he had made that Hanna had let live.

“And the ring?” Maren said, after the conversation had fought through other underbrush and arrived where it had wanted to be, because her work trained her to admit objects into rooms, and the day had been made of objects that had opinions. She did not say: are you letting it tell you how to behave. She said: is it behaving. He made a face and took a sip of his lukewarm and watched the Gull linger on the water as if indecision itself had been feathered.

“It warms when I tell the truth,” he said, because that had become true enough to say aloud without a couch to lie on. “It tightens when I try to make sentences that protect me. It is ridiculous, and also it is less ridiculous than I expected, and I hate how relieved part of me is to have a thing that punishes me when I’m lazy.”

Sebastian looked at him not as a rival and not as a client for advice, but like a man who could carry weight and just wanted to know the weight’s shape. “Objects are only too honest because we ask them to be when we’re tired,” he said, speaking the theology of rope. “You can lie to yourself for years and not even have to take off your shoes. A knife won’t let you do that. Neither will a line when you’re over water.”

Maren held his look like a small bird she knew would leave if she breathed on it. “We should write our labels in the collection like that,” she said, half amused, half prayerful. “No more of this museum voice. ‘Brace, iron and oath. Known to have made men say out loud who they were and what they meant and to have burned them if they weren’t both at once.’ People would pay extra.”

They laughed, and the laugh was not a bridge to anything complicated, which was a gift. Later, when the jetty had been persuaded to stop sulking and the crane had folded itself back into a well-mannered truck, they walked up along the promenade to the tram like old sailors learning how to use shoes again. Sebastian peeled off to check a thing with a colleague who had the hands of a harpist and the rope habits of a spider, and Maren and Syd found themselves next to the artfully placed boulders that people liked to sit on in summer when the fjord pretended not to want them dead. The water licked the edge like a dog that had not made up its mind about civilization.

“I would like—not now, not with the smell of brine in our hair—to get the silver ring back into the world it came from,” she said. “I mean: to Liv’s hand. Or to a box she chooses. With ceremony, or at least with a promise not to do stupid things that only seem clever from one angle.”

He said he had the same thought, and she nodded as if an agreement had been reached by two governments and would be announced to the press after lunch. He watched her look at the water with the very particular fondness of a person not sure when they will be allowed to come back. “Sebastian is a person who has learned not to narrate the world while he’s in it,” she said, almost as if to herself. “I forgot that was possible. I like the part of me that exists when I’m near that. I like the part of you that stands next to it and doesn’t try to stand in front.”

He took that as it was given and the ring warmed like a stove turned very low, a practical heat you didn’t notice until you missed it. They took the tram and agreed to meet later because the day still had jobs for them both; she had a dye that needed pleading with in the lab and he had a day-long committee harvested from paper and worry.

Liv opened the door with flour on her nose again as if she had decided that would be her brand all winter, and drew him in without asking him whether he had time for coffee, because whether a person has time for coffee is not a real question in a family. He put the loaf on the counter with its brown, ridiculous scent and took the note from his pocket and the silver ring in its small, insufficient box. He had not brought flowers because the city was between seasons of reasonable beauty, and he did not want, in any case, to suggest that this was an apology made medicinal by petals.

They did it clumsily and remembered it for that exact reason. Liv sat at the table and made the kind of square with her two hands on the wood that you use when you measure a piece of fabric without a tape. Stig stood, then sat, then stood, and then found the wall with the back of his head in the way old men pretend is a stretch. Syd told them the ring had been under the dish with the spent matches in his own home for exactly the amount of time that made the story hum with shame and comedy both. Liv listened as if collecting the words into her apron pocket where she kept clothespins. “There is a ceremony that ordinary people perform when they have not been taught how to perform ceremonies,” she said, in her teacher voice that had outlived a career. “It is called honesty with hands.”

She put out her right hand and he placed the ring on her palm and she closed her fingers the way you do when a coin is put there and the world demands you trick a child about where it has gone. “My grandmother wore this ring when she crossed a border with a loaf that had nails in it,” she said, the story arriving as if the ring worried it out of her. “The nails were to keep men in uniforms from deciding it was bread for sale. They had been told to search for profit and not for hunger. She took the nails out on the other side and the bread tasted like blood and like home. She told me that a ring takes names better than a loaf does. I am not sure that’s true. But I have been unkind to this object by asking it to make me a bridge. It is not built for that. It is built for circles.” She looked up, eyes shiny and not broken, and held the ring up in the air like a minor sacrament. “You came back,” she said to it like a person speaking to a dog they love and don’t trust, and slid it on for a second and then took it off and laid it in the box as if tucking a baby and then admitted it was only a baby for show.

Stig poured coffee into cups as if coffee could seal things, and perhaps it can. They sat and the room arranged itself around that small glitter that had never been glitter at all. There was not much to say after that; their gratitude was a quiet creature and unapt for tricks. He left feeling like a button had been pushed through a hole it had been designed for, and marveled at how tiny and huge such satisfactions are.

On the walk back, the city had wiped its eyes with the back of its hand and decided to be damp rather than tragic. Ms. Mathisen’s name, that thread tugged from a morning, hung in fainter air and then arrived as if that air had been careful after all. The call came from an unknown number with the jittery under-music of a new smartphone in a cheap case, and his body answered before his mind could caution it. Her voice was matter-of-fact with the strain left in, a violin carried too far in a cold. “They threw the last of it,” she said with very little ornament. “The landlord said the forty-eight hours were up and then the next forty-eight hours started again for him and not for me. My son went and there was a skip and a man with a cap and his arms said no with their sleeves. He pulled one box. The rest had the weight of cloth. He brought this because it rattled.”

Syd adjusted the strap of his bag because he needed to adjust something. He asked her to meet him at the office because that was where he had the fiction of authority; she said she would because that was where he kept his face. When she arrived she carried the box like a person who has worked with her back for years and has no patience for performative fragility. Her son trailed her at a distance composed of both love and humiliation, the complicated twenty-something’s tether.

They set the box on the table by the window where they take statements that don’t hurt anyone yet. Jens was there and not there, doing the thing people do when they have learned that hovering is a rudeness that can be weaponized. The box was old and laminated and had a playful photograph of a cartoon dog on the side that had aged badly. Inside, the things were shirt-buttons, cheap and cheerful, an ashtray from a pub that had burned and risen again as a different pub, a jar of screws she had inherited from someone else’s father, and a diary with a cover the color of a bruise.

“Your son says it makes the sound of metal,” she said, practical, and poised the jar over the table. She poured the screws out with the smile of a woman who has learned to enjoy the order of such small chaos, and kissed her teeth when a single key showed itself from among the heads and threads. The key was smooth from years in a pocket; the ring part had been bent like a question and bent back like an answer. “Not to the new lock,” she said. “To the small cupboard under the sink the landlord never fixed right. My boy cannot be convinced he is not a detective.”

The boy grinned and then remembered he was supposed to be mad and put his face back on. Syd palmed the key and felt the ring’s hum at the intersection of circle and tooth, and decided to go with the cheap grace of coincidence one more hour. He sent a junior with a flash of badge to ask the skip man to hold off on throwing the rest until a public servant had had his look; the junior went with a new appetite for the job and a new haircut that kept getting in his eyes. Ms. Mathisen and her son and Syd took the tram like real people do when they have a problem and no blue lights. On the step of the building the cold smelled like damp paper and old cooking oil and something else—maybe sorrow, which is never as clean as in books. The key liked the cupboard the way certain keys like to perform being useful. The door swung open on a space where a bottle of bleach had done some of the living. There was a ledger crammed into the back, the way a person hides a present under the bed from themselves so they can be surprised by their own lack of memory.

It was not a thick book. It had been given a cover by a mind that liked to pretend that a thing could be more important if you put it in a jacket. Inside were pages where a man had written numbers and dates as if numbers and dates were a language that could prevent weather. There were notes pinned to the ledger with straight pins a woman had put in with no regard for a thumb. There were receipts and there were scraps and there was, halfway through, a letter as old as the bribe letter but less coy about its task: a man in a city office acknowledging a favor done with a phrase that had not learned to be ashamed yet, his signature a flourish that thought it would never be called to court. The name at the bottom was not the same as the one on Populus that morning, but it nested in the same family tree, a branch that had not been pruned because who prunes power when it gives you shade.

Ms. Mathisen looked at the page in a way that made it clear her life did not contain the energy to enjoy scandal; it contained the energy to boil potatoes without burning them while a person phoned a hotline on speaker behind her. “I don’t want trouble,” she said, and then shook her head at her own mouth. “I want the right person to be the person who gets paid because I paid them. That is not poetry. That is a sentence the world should teach children to write.”

Jens said nothing and took pictures with the app they used when they wanted the electrons to know who they were and where they had stood. Syd felt the ring warm when Ms. Mathisen decided truth did not make her an activist, and he wanted to kiss the stupid band for being not mystical and so very itself. He asked her if they could borrow the ledger long enough to take scans that would satisfy both a judge and an archivist and she said yes because her house had already lost.

Back at the office, Hanna’s eyebrows had a sit-down with one another over the second page. “There’s not enough grammar in this to make a case,” she said, honest like a doctor. “There is enough to annoy a surname. Populus will eat it with sauce.” She was not annoyed with the ledger. She was annoyed at how useful it was not and how much noise it would make anyway. “Do it clean,” she added. “If we do this badly we will be performing indignation for the people who love that kind of theatre. Have a lawyer look at the flaws so we don’t fall into them.”

He walked the ledger across town to the museum because both his worlds had sharpened and he was a creature who carried things between rooms. Maren met him with her sleeves rolled and her mind on three jobs, and when the ledger came out of its bag she put two hands on the table in the way of a person asking the table to behave. She had the scans done by a student in a sweater that had pretensions of history and a job waiting in a better-funded country, and the machine sang happily at paper because it likes being told that something flat is a mountain. They fanned the pages after to let them rest, and Maren’s hair fell out of its knot with the defiance it had learned as a teenager.

“This is going to do what the oath-brace does, only in a modern tone and with worse lighting,” she said. “It’s going to call a few men to come and say their names out loud and it’s going to burn them on the internet and then the city will try to put down sawdust so it can carry on. Sebastian says the jetty is older than the plate on it. He says someone took an old thing and made it bear modern words because those words needed a body. People do that with laws, too. He is un-romantic in his conclusions; perhaps that’s why I trust him.”

Syd watched her look at the ledger with that exact way she looks at wood and silk and the scraped edge of a promise, and felt a soreness in himself that had the clean pain of a bruise you deserve. He told her about the cupboard and the key that liked only one door, and about Ms. Mathisen in her coat that had learned to be both barrier and blanket at the same time, and she made the small noise that is both respect and sadness. “Will you be ‘quoted source within city agency’,” she asked with a smile that unzipped at the corners into worry, “or will you be ‘man who handed over to appropriate authorities and kept his job for once’.”

“Second one,” he said, lying only in the confidence of his tone, and the ring bit his finger like a fish that just wanted him to admit the hook was in, and he amended it in the next breath. “Second if I can. First if I must. Neither if I can get away with standing in the back and making sure the lights stay on.”

They planned the small ceremony for the silver ring the way you plan a joke that could go bad, with practice and a little prayer and a willingness to run away if everyone started coughing. They chose Liv’s kitchen because the kitchen had already decided to be a church in previous decades, and because Stig had an apron now that he wore with the solemnity of a man who knows he does not wear it well and insists all the same. Maren came early and stood with her elbow on the counter reading aloud rules she’d found in a book about farmhouses in Telemark, where people pinned metal to lintels to remind their hearts to behave when the weather did not. Sebastian was late because a rope had forgotten how to be itself at the last minute and needed persuasion. Aila arrived because she was incapable of pretending she did not care whether people told the truth to objects they had made, and took off her coat and folded it in a precise square like she was keeping its secrets safe.

They put the silver ring in the dish with the matches as if to re-enact a crime with consent. Liv took it up and told the nails-in-bread story again, and this time Maren’s mouth did the thing it does when an old detail matches a new fact, and she asked questions about the border that made the border sit up and put its hat on with a small surprise. They all spoke a sentence, because that seemed reasonable; they each had to choose one that began with I and did not steal anyone else’s mouth. Stig said, I wanted this to be easy because I wanted what I wanted and I’m learning the magical thinking that tells me I could have all the good without any of the work is not actually magic. Liv said, I am tired of wanting metal to carry me across spaces other people built with boards and nails, and in the saying looked younger in a way that did not belong to the skin. Aila said, I have been lying to rope for years by telling it I would only ask it to hold up the nice people, and everyone laughed and then didn’t.

When it was his turn, Syd thought he would say something clever because he is the sort of person who has been rewarded for saying clever things. The ring tightened slightly in anticipation of that familiar dodge, and he surprised himself by leaving the clever alone. “I loved you,” he said in Maren’s direction as if naming the weather after the flood mattered, and then added, “I do not require a medal for figuring out how to be decent in the aftermath.” The ring warmed with a chastened approval that felt, absurdly, like a dog thumping its tail under the table where it thinks no one can see. Maren said, very quietly and without operatics, “I loved you, and I love you, and I am building a room where that love lives with other furniture and it is neither a stoning place nor a shrine,” and Sebastian took a breath that looked pained on him for a fragment and then changed his mind and nod-laughed and reached for the bread as if bread is the only safe object in rooms like these.

After, their bodies needed a thing to do so they cooked, because doing a thing with heat is very good for you when you have been truthful and have not died. Aila taught Stig a knot for a roast the roast did not require and Stig performed it with a solemnity that made Liv get flour on his nose by force just to assert the world’s silliness. Maren and Sebastian stood shoulder to shoulder over a pan that hissed like someone had a secret, the ease of their bodies not quite a conversation yet but happily conspiring, and Syd put out plates and cut bread and turned the silver ring in its dish with a single finger like the minute hand of an old clock that only has one good job anymore.

The hearing’s echo did not leave his day, because nothing politicked in daylight is content to stay there. Populus did what Populus does when hunger and wit line up; it served a meal that looked like justice and tasted like drama. A user named Spray typed with the skeptical compassion of a teacher: name names or you are making a performance for people who enjoy noise, and was answered by a user named Hammer with an emoji of a ring and a picture of the oath-brace, and the argument turned into a new neighborhood nobody could afford. A clerk from the committee—the boy who might yet become a man able to look at himself in mirrors with gratitude—sent an anonymous letter to a journalist with a scan of a message in which a certain surname had directed a vote like a wedding dance, and the boy went at lunchtime to the museum with the kind of stomach people had when they’d done a things that would change their day. He stood in front of the oath-brace and did not touch it because he had learned a boundary somewhere that mattered, and put his hand on the glass instead, and the glass fogged with his breath and made a circle where his palm had been, and he nodded to it as if someone had answered a roll call.

Syd watched him from the corner, because he had promised himself he would not meddle and had failed in finer ways. He did not speak to him because some moments are not improved by grown men introducing themselves. He stood in the doorway long enough to see the boy put his hand down at his side and his shoulders do the complicated movement they do when a person has told their truth and the world has not fallen apart. The ring warmed with a professional calm, and he wondered if he would ever be free of wanting a metal thing to behave like a compass and whether that want was itself a kind of laziness he would have to turn into work.

He slept harder than he had in weeks and woke with the particular industrious shame of a person who has overslept by a minute in a life that did not require him to. The thistle-haired man did not come that night, but the bench did, the bench now on a ferry with plastic seats and a vending machine that had learned to be sad about chocolate. In the dream he sat and drew in sand with his finger again and found that his pattern had changed while he had not watched it: the circle he had drawn now came with rope laid over it, the rope making a knot whose name he could almost say and then couldn’t. He tried to pull one end and it tightened and he thought ah, a life, and then he took both ends and did something Aila had shown Stig with a roast that had not needed it, and the knot softened instead of cinching, a generosity he had not expected. The dream smiled at him with the ruthless cheer that is how we admit we love being instructed, and he woke up with the word “bend” in his mouth like a hard candy he could not yet swallow.

By the time the day put on its shoes, Hanna had scheduled another meeting in the room with the walnut pretense. There would be a talk about “object ethics,” her email said, which was the way a bureaucracy tried to bulk up its muscles for a fight it feared was symbolic. Aila was there, as predicted, occupying the last row like a cliff. A man from the council with the nephew’s last name sat two seats from the front and wore a tie the color of money you can’t trace. The woman on the committee who had once asked the impolite good question sharpened her pencil the way she might sharpen a knife. Syd sat where he could see the door because he liked knowing that there was air beyond whatever words came next.

They talked about the oath-brace, as if the iron could sue. They talked about the ledger, as if paper were guilty of harboring shame. They said “cultural responsibility” and “custodial neutrality” and “narrative stewardship,” and somewhere under those phrases was the small, unlovely fact that a boy in a white shirt with a kinship to a man in a blue suit had sent an email in the night that would make a person have to say yes or no rather than maybe. He said his pieces when asked and did not decorate them, because the ring had trained him and because decoration wastes air needed by better things. When the man with the nephew’s name spoke it was in the measured accent of men who expect a microphone at least twice in their lifetime; he spoke of tradition with a slanted affection and people with faults who had served the city of our hearts with such vigor, and in his sentences the word we did labor past its capacity, dragging the sled of implication with it.

After, the boy from the back row stood up on legs that were not interested in him that day and asked to speak, and Hanna’s mouth opened to instruct him about the order of things, and then closed because the room had the rare condition of wanting to hear him. He said, I sent a thing, and no one told me to, and I am not noble and I am not brave and I am not particularly clever, and my grandfather told me a story about a ring in the church on Sólheimar where he put his hand and said a thing and then did it, and while I am not over fond of old men and their maps, I decided to behave like the kind of person who says a thing and then does it. My family will not like me for a while, and that is not the state’s business, and the state does enough of its own not liking to keep itself busy. But I am telling you because every room needs one person who says something honest at the wrong time. He sat down, and his ears went red, and the ring on Syd’s finger warmed so obviously that he put his other hand over it, as if to calm it, and felt the absurd pleasure of being congratulated by a lump of alloy.

After the meeting, Aila did what she had promised and did not do: she waited in the hallway without asking, and when people passed she became the wall until she needed to be the door. She stopped Syd with a half-smile that did not cancel the lines of her fatigue. “Men and boys have said truths with very poor timing since the first rope was braided,” she said. “It’s the good way. It’s the only way the truth knows it’s truth. It cannot grow in well-tended fields. It likes the edges of the path where the city forgets to poison the weeds.”

The day earned a small calm with all that heat and then put it in its pocket. He ate something careless at his desk and had the kind of coffee that punishes you for not walking to the good place, and when Maren texted that she would be at the pier at four to watch Sebastian bully a treacherous winch into kindness he told her he was coming without consulting his calendar. He arrived in time to see Sebastian lean into a handle with a confidence that would have been unbearable if it had pretended to be modest. The winch thought about giving up its little secret and then decided to be flattered by human attention, and the line ran smooth again like sentence after a draft.

They sat on the crate that pretended to be a bench and watched the water deliberately not be ice. Maren had a thermos of tea that had known better days and poured him some and he accepted it as an act of faith between people who could do better but didn’t now because now was fine. Sebastian told a story about a boat that had come in with its pride ahead of its hull and how you have to learn to talk to a vessel that thinks it knows best, and it was not, of course, much about boats. They let the afternoon slide toward night and when they stood to go, someone had left on the pad the oath-brace in its case, visible to no one but them because the light had slunk off and taken any hasty thieves with it.

“Do not,” Maren said, with a smile at Syd that had the particular shape of warnings delivered again without malice. He held up his hands palm-out and then did not obey immediately because there are moments when obedience is cowardice. He placed his hand on the glass and said not a promise and not a speech, but a sentence he could bear to carry without the ring choking his blood. “I will not use old things to get away from the work new things require,” he said. The ring warmed. The glass stayed glass. The iron inside did not move, but if iron could have a face it would have looked at him with the disinterest of a person who has heard every kind of thing and is waiting for someone to turn up tomorrow, sober and with their sleeves rolled.

They parted at the tram, and Sebastian touched the back of Maren’s scarf in a gesture so quick it might have been a joke about static, and Syd felt himself uncapable of the old jealousies for one clean minute. He stood a little away from them, his body learning the shape of a new generosity he could not have been forced into. The tram arrived with the hiss of a thing pleased with its own punctuality and took them away in different directions, and the night blew its stale breath on the windows and then backed off as if it had thought better of it.

On his landing, the light had given up and the sensor pretended not to know him, and he found the keyhole like a person familiar with guessing. There was a second envelope on his mat, this one with a hand he did not recognize and a single sentence inside that had done weights in the gym of being calm. It said: there is a meeting in a back room of a seafood restaurant on Thursday where men will say that Populus is a toy and that boys should not be allowed to speak and that rope is for tying and not for holding, and if you were to bring a person with a camera and a person with a better brain than yours, you might enjoy watching them swallow their fish with difficulty. No signature, no flourish, no throat-clearing. He stood with it in his kitchen and the ring did not heat, which was perhaps the only time that day that had felt like a failure. He called Hanna because that is what you do when you are tired of acting like the only adult in your little planet.

She listened and wrote it down and said the name of the restaurant without needing time to recall it, because power eats in only so many places. “We won’t act like detectives when we are clerks,” she said, and he loved her for making that distinction with grim humor. “But we will send a man with a face that refuses to be ignored by waiters, and we will pass the letter to the people who still believe in the difference between gotcha and record. Also, for the record, bring the better brain. It is not a fireable offense to have friends who can think.”

He didn’t sleep and then he did, and in the time between he discovered that being awake can be a sleep if it is the kind where you watch your thoughts play by themselves without you needing to referee. In his dream that night, the thistle-haired man held the ring box again, and this time there was a ring in it, a stupid brass thing like the kind kids buy from a machine that dispenses balls of plastic and sugar. The man was not laughing now; he was grinning as if he had just told a joke no one would get for a hundred years. “The problem is not that things hold you,” he said. “The problem is that you let them hold you for the wrong distance. You give a ring the job of a bridge and the bridge the job of a map and the map the job of a prayer. Draw a new pattern. You’re allowed. You think you aren’t because it feels like it would be rude to the dead. The dead have plenty of respect stored. You can take some out.”

On Thursday, the back room smelled like yesterday’s lemons and a painting of a sea that had never seen a boat. Hanna’s person with a face sat discreetly with a colleague whose haircut told you both that she was very good at her work and that she would refuse to have a drink with you even if you had earned it. The men filed in with ties that suggested the rich have a memo about color we do not get, and one of them was the one with the nephew’s last name and his mouth did that thing mouths do when they are about to condemn a new method by comparing it to a toy. Syd did not enter, because he would be recognized by one, and because he had learned something about how to make rooms work on your behalf without being in them. He waited across the street with a beer that had been poured by a person who could not be convinced to enjoy their job, and looked around to discover that half the bar was half the city and the other half was the city that pretends not to be one, and that the person with the better brain had arrived.

Maren sat with him like a sibling at a wedding where the bride is beautiful and the groom is acceptable and the chicken will be dry. She had the note with her because she respects paper more than most of us do and hid it under her palm the way people hide coins because they like how it makes them feel. “They will be ordinary and that will make it harder,” she said, and he agreed in his throat because his mouth did not want to have to say it. “They will say we have turned activism into craft and we will have to bear that, and they will think we have made craft into activism and we will ignore that because we know better, and somewhere someone will take a photograph of an oath-brace and a ledger and write a caption that will make me want to change my name and move to a fjord with no signal.”

He told her about his dream and she shook her head and smiled in a way that did not mock him, and then her smile dimmed in a very particular way and he turned without wanting to and saw that Sebastian had come in the door and was looking for them with the body language of a man who is either about to deliver news or to ask for a kindness. He arrived at the table and placed his hands on the wood and the wood recognized him the way wooden things do when you belong to them. “The boy from the committee,” he said, and both of them listened instinctively in the way you listen when a rope is being paid out, “was at the pier. He touched the glass and then he touched the iron when no one was looking because he is not perfect and because you cannot make all hands good. He cried for so short a time that he was almost a man. I told him to sit down with me and we had a coffee and I told him a thing my father told me when I did something out of turn: it is not whether you spoke when you were called that matters most; it is whether you show up when the work is handed out. He said he will. I told him to buy gloves.”

The three of them sat over their beer and their air as the back room filled with voices that believed themselves to be songs and would prove, on tape, to be only voices. The person with the face came out twice to use the bathroom and raised his eyebrows the second time without meaning to in the way of a man satisfied by the arithmetic of one lie too many. When it was done Hanna’s phone vibrated the way a small machine does when it has eaten the right number, and a message walked out of a journalist’s hands into the city through wires like water through sluices, and somewhere a boy put his head down on a desk and slept for ten respectable minutes in an office that should have fired everyone and didn’t.

At home, he spread the note on the table with the other notes he was keeping like a man who feared wind, and the ring lay beside them like a coin the universe had not decided to accept. He wrote on a piece of paper without meaning to and saw that he had made a list with columns: time and truth. Under time he wrote Ms. Mathisen, Aila, the ledger, the boy. Under truth he wrote Maren, the silver ring, the oath-brace, his own mouth at Liv’s table. He laughed at himself because the list looked like prayer disguised as minutes. He put the paper in the drawer with the batteries that did not fit anything and the rubber bands that had learned futility and the receipt that had faded to a pale patience, and he put the ring on his finger and it was quiet as if he had promised to stop asking it to be a god and start letting it be a thing that keeps his hand honest. He slept without the thistle-haired man’s bench, which was either progress or simply a weather pattern, and woke to a city that had found another way to be itself and was eager to show him.10

By morning the city had turned the leak into a weather system and moved on to discussing how best to travel in it. Buses were late. Populus had sewn itself into a roaring banner, each knot a comment threaded through with screenshots and sighs. The paper that still liked to be paper had chosen a photograph of the oath-brace to crown its front, the iron held in a light that made it look like a moon drawn down for questioning. Syd stood at his window, a mug in his hand, the ring quiet against his skin as if it, too, were listening to an argument occurring two streets over. He counted the cyclists who refused to believe in drizzle and the pedestrians who had learned that umbrellas are more honest as flags than they are as roofs. When the kettle clicked its afterthought click, he refilled his cup without remembering the motion that took him there. An ambulance stitched sound along the far road, and the sound made his ribcage briefly ceremonial. The ring did not tighten at the thought he did not fully admit: it would be easier if some object would just tell him when to speak and when to keep his mouth out of other people’s weather.

At the office, Hanna’s door was open and her chin spoke before her mouth did. Behind the glass in her case, the policy manual had been joined by a new binder that had nothing written on its spine yet and therefore owned the room by implication. Jens gave him a paper cup and a look that suggested jokes were being saved for later like candles. “The inspectorate is playing host,” Hanna said when he stood in the doorway, and she made host sound like a synonym for infection. “Your ledger has made itself very popular. The boy is annoyingly photogenic in a way that will keep him safe. The man with the name has issued a statement leaning on the word legacy until it goes flat.”

“The woman with the cupboard has a new lock and an old ledger to tell grandchildren about,” Jens added. He lowered his voice as if gossip were a bird worth coaxing. “They put her in the the article with grocery shelves behind her and made her look like the country itself. She did not smile. I loved that for her.”

“The museum would like someone from the city to stand next to the oath-brace for the news and say something that doesn’t make the object seem complicit,” Hanna continued, and handed him a sheet like a hot plate. “You know what to do with commas. Use fewer than usual. Try not to invent a metaphor on camera. If they ask you to swear on it, tell them the humidity is wrong.”

He took the paper and resisted the urge to slide the ring off into his pocket. On his way back to his desk he paused by the window that made a postcard out of the road works. A man in a neon vest lifted a pallet with a gesture that suggested prayer and sarcasm in equal measure. On Populus a user named HouseboundAunt had posted a memory of putting a hand on an oath ring in a little church when she married a man in ’63 and how the iron had been cold enough to make the truth feel like a frost, and the comments underneath had turned strange and kind. Somewhere between those two climates, Syd’s part sat like a kettle warming for the water other people would pour.

The museum had already turned into an airport. People who had never come on Wednesdays were there on a Wednesday, shushing their own children with delight because they could. The security guard had become a customs officer with a smile. Inside the lab, Maren had tied her hair up in a loose pile that admitted to hours, and the desk wore the day like a tool belt. “There’s a request from a television program to do a segment called ‘Do Rings Remember,’” she said without looking up, the words made dry by the effort of not throwing the request into a bin. “I told them our objects are not golden retrievers. They wrote back asking what time suited.”

“Today the oath-brace is a co-star,” he said, and she glanced up with the quick look that told you she was placing you in the arrangement of lenses and chairs for the next few hours. Sebastian leaned in the doorway with a coil like a shoulder and a grin as politely weary as a train conductor’s. He lifted his hand without committing to anyone’s air and made a little salute with two fingers. “I will keep the cranes from photobombing,” he said. “We will dress the work in its work clothes so it doesn’t look like a saint being asked to wash dishes.”

“We had a thought,” Maren said, pushing a sheet across the table with the specific embarrassment of a person who knows the thought will be misunderstood by someone and is hoping it will not be you. “Visitors keep asking if they can… touch it or say something to it. We won’t let them. It would be unethical and also unhealthy for iron and people. But we could set up a small replica—a band of iron, not ancient, on a pedestal that understands fingerprints, with a label that invites sentences. ‘Tell the object a simple truth you can bear to hear yourself admit.’ Then we collect the cards. People like boxes with slots. People like confessing to furniture.”

“Wouldn’t that turn the museum into a church?” he asked, and she looked down at her own hands and smiled the way a woman smiles when she was raised to refute that and then learned otherwise. “It already is, some days,” she said. “We just don’t let incense in because it upsets the fire alarms. The difference being: our gods are tired and rusty and haven’t eaten anyone.”

Sebastian said that if they were going to ask visitors to speak they had better be prepared to hear what they didn’t want to put on a brochure, and then he listed the kinds of admissions people would slip into a box if you gave them anonymity and an object to aim their attention at. None of them were photogenic. All of them were exactly what a city is made of when it’s too honest for its hair. He touched the bracer’s case with a knuckle, careful as if it were a sleeping dog that didn’t belong to him. “I like that it has outlived all the men who ordered men around,” he said. “It makes me less bored with the species.”

The television crew turned up with soft shoes and soft voices and hard eyes. Syd stood to one side while the presenter made the sentences she had brought with her sound new by saying them near a thing that refused to react. When it was his turn to answer why rings matter, he named paper and rope and the friction it takes to keep any promise from sliding out of a person’s hands. He said ordinary words like fairness and name and how, and the ring on his finger warmed like a little note passed under a desk saying: that will do. When the presenter asked him—cheerful as a cousin at a party—whether he would put his hand into the case if he could, he smiled in the way Hanna had asked him to and said he didn’t need to. Touch was not the only way to be held.

After lunch the world remembered that it needed to be paid for. Aila called with a tone that meant she was beginning at the end. “They ordered twenty meters of rope from me like I was a hardware store,” she said, offense and amusement braided with the carelessness of someone carrying a box down a staircase. “I told them if they wanted rope for a ribbon-cutting, they could cut their own ties. If they wanted rope for a piece of work that would hold weight and weather, I would talk. A boy with a lanyard asked me what I meant by weather.”

“The city wants a public art thing,” Jens reported later, waving an email like a sail. “An installation with knots that the citizens tie to show their commitment to, I don’t know, not breaking pieces of each other. They want it by March. They want it to be ‘interactive’ and ‘healing’ and also easy to sweep up if people complain. They would like your advice on how to make the word accountability look like a ribbon.”

“Tell them rope is for holding,” Syd said, and didn’t catch the joke in time. Jens did the thing where he blew air between his teeth as if cooling a spoon. “We’ll put Aila’s hands on it,” he said. “If they make it ugly, we will say the weather did it.”

Liv called while he was pinning a dull reply to a bright request. Her voice had sleep in it though it was only three. “I did a foolish thing that used to be a reasonable thing,” she said. “I promised a neighbor she could borrow a ring. Not the silver. Another. A circle to carry a hope for an afternoon. The sort of promise our age was built on. Then I remembered the dog ate the ring in ’09. Would you come to dinner and help me lie charmingly to a girl who doesn’t need a ring to be brave.”

He promised the charming lie would be the sort he could live with, and she sniffed and said that would be a first. Stig shouted greetings in a key reserved for men cooking beans, and in the background Maren’s voice appeared as if she had been leaning against a counter and decided to speak at that exact moment, the coincidence a polite hand placed on his day. “I’m staying for supper,” she said without getting on the phone, and then, closer, “if that’s fine,” and Liv made a scoffing noise that could have been translated as please never ask that again as long as we breathe.

The library had squeezed an emergency into a community room because the city had been fed something it could not chew alone. Plastic chairs, tea bags, a woman distributing the wrong biscuits with the ferocity of a saint. A sign taped to the door in a hand that didn’t know it was beautiful: we will listen with our mouths closed. Aila came in smelling of weather and work and sat at the end as if she intended to be the punctuation the meeting needed. Ms. Mathisen had her son with her and the box with the dog face used as a handbag now, which felt right for a victory that had mixed flour with law. Syd stood in a corner and pretended to assist with the extension cord until someone put the microphone in his hand because a man with a tie had failed to make the room trust him.

He said his small truths, the ones that fit into the kinds of sentences that did not require the ring to squeeze the blood out of his finger to keep him honest. He talked about discretion as ballast and how neutrality is not the same as no one getting wet. He mentioned rooms where decisions are made and how, if you are lucky, the door is made of glass. He said a line that made him wince while he was saying it because of how it would scan later—“we are not machines; we decide to be kind”—and accepted the warmth on his hand as the price of sounding like a poster. Ms. Mathisen stood and said that she did not want a poster or a parade; she wanted the kind of rules that kept decent people from having to be brave on Tuesdays. The room breathed in and then out like a lung that had been bribed to keep going. The boy from the committee, recognizably the same and recognizably not, spoke without being given the microphone. He said he did not feel like a hero and did not want to be told he was wrong. The room laughed in that careful way community rooms acquire, a noise that makes sure it will not break anyone delicate. Aila waited until the quiet was solid and then said, “Tell the rope what you’re making,” and three men who had come to disagree with everything found that they had nothing disagreeable left to hold.

After, while people were putting chairs back in the wrong places with a purposeful incompetence that meant they would have to gather again sooner rather than later, a man with hair like broom bristles at rest came and sat on the heating pipes and watched Syd with an expression that could pass for uninterest in a court. He told a story without introduction about a village on a river that had given its oath-ring to a family for safekeeping during a war and then forgotten to ask for it back, and how the family had passed it down like a grudge until someone put it in a drawer beneath the cutlery. He said the fiddle sounded better when played near the drawer, and no one involved believed in magic, which had helped. He looked at Syd’s hand in a way that made the ring feel seen and did not ask anything. “Debts that like singing,” he said as if naming the species of fish he had been after that morning, “don’t like being written down. You are making yours a little tuneful. Don’t sing it so loud you can’t hear it.”

He left before Syd could ask if he had a bench.

The office, the pier, the museum—those three addresses had learned his weight. That week he added a fourth: the public swimming pool that smelled of cheap disinfectant and old happiness. He thought of cold water and the diver he did not become. He thought of the dignity of being unnecessary in a lane while old men with wrinkled backs sang to themselves, mouths closed under the surface. He put the ring in the little plastic locker with his phone and his keys and felt oddly exposed, then laughed at himself because he was in trunks standing next to twelve strangers and why should jewelry change the measure. He slid into the water and found that it took the air he had been too preoccupied to notice he carried. He swam two lengths and then another, badly, because boys who teach themselves are sometimes stubborn in both style and commitment. When he got out, a sun that the architects had allowed in on purpose rested on the far tiles as if claiming its season early. Back at the locker, he held the ring a moment before sliding it back on. There was no trick of metal. Only skin and habit and the sudden thought that perhaps the work was to know the shape of his hand with and without.

By the time the seafood back room’s noise had been turned into sentences, small parts of the city had changed jobs. The man with the nephew’s name wrote a column in which he cast himself as the kind of person who had to choose between loyalty and law and had bravely chosen to misremember the timeline. The boy’s anonymous letter had spawned cousins. The inspectorate liked the word inquiry so much it was forced to use it twice in a headline. Hanna produced a smile so sharp it could have scored glass and took Syd to a corridor to tell him that two resignations committed to the concept of more time with family, and that Populus had discovered a new favorite phrase—oath-breakers in good coats—and would peddle it until the coat season ended. “We will be asked to be better than we are in a meeting,” she said. “We will fail and then fail slightly better. That is the best we can promise short of God, and I have no intention of auditioning.”

Aila’s shop learned to say no to men with clipboards and yes to a girl of eight who wanted to learn a splice. She put up a sheet of paper with a time on it, and a line formed that looked like the city trying to tie itself into something other than anger. The commission for the rope installation arrived with too much money and too many adjectives. Syd asked if he might facilitate the kind of workshop that would result in an object that tied the word public to something you could actually hold. Aila snorted and said he could stand at the side and say nothing if he could manage it. The first afternoon he failed to say nothing and the ring welcomed the failure and he sank into a chair with a satisfaction that had nothing to do with being centered. A boy tied a knot that had no name and refused to be undone; an old woman taught the old trick with the loop that looked like a rabbit and the rabbit somehow learned its way out of the hole without tearing a history. They pinned their efforts to a scaffold like washing and claimed the line felt like a street when it was full of other people’s weather.

Ms. Mathisen invited him to her new flat with the matter-of-fact ceremony of a person giving someone a coat hook. She had a bell by the door because she did not trust the buzzer yet, and her son had mounted a little shelf that the spirit level hated. There was a fern with ambition drooping over a radiator because ambition is drawn to heat. On the counter sat a jar of screws, this one with a lid. She showed him the cupboard under her sink and the way it had a shadow of a ledger where a ledger would never be again. When she said thank you it was not a blessing and not a sentence you drop between people to see if it will leak. It was a screw turned until it caught. He said, clumsily, that she owed him nothing, and she looked at him like a person who knows how to calculate. “We owe only the truth that fits our mouths,” she said. “You speak yours. We’re square.”

The night before the museum launched its replica-ring-and-slot experiment, they allowed themselves a small good wine at Liv and Stig’s because the room needed a new smell to set a fresh layer of memory. Sebastian came with flowers that did not apologize for winter. Maren wore a sweater that had been her mother’s once and had learned to fit two women. They ate something that did not pretend to be ambitious. Aila was late because rope had wrapped itself around a coil in a gesture of self-love and needed untangling; when she arrived she put a small length of line on the table and they all fidgeted with it while pretending to listen to a story Stig told for the thousandth time because it was the story that made him feel like a man that the day had not made into string.

Liv asked if she might borrow the ring, not the one that bit and warmed but the silver that had chosen a drawer under matches as its last known profession. She wanted to pass it through a pair of hands and then back because a neighbor was leaving the country with a man who had sensible shoes and needed to feel like she belonged to a circle not constructed solely of airline miles. Syd nodded and slid the box across the table and watched as a small, make-believe ceremony occurred between the living and the object in a kitchen that had served this purpose for more people than he suspected. He kept his own ring on his finger and did not offer to have it do any work on behalf of this small ritual. It warmed anyway, in that way it had begun to adopt when it approved of his non-interference as if delighting in his good behavior was part of the new treaty.

He slept that night with a heaviness that later felt like preparedness. In the morning he went to the museum with a bag that contained more authority than it had a month ago. The replica band sat on its pedestal like a harmless thing. The slot into which people would feed their sentences had been cut into a wooden box old enough to have been a different box once, and Maren had written a label that would earn her a reprimand from a supervisor in a museum that hadn’t decided to change. “This object does not record your honesty,” it read. “You do. Please do not make the iron do your job.” Sebastian stood slightly to the side with a look that said he had no dog in this fight and cared very much about dogs. The first person to write a truth on a card was a woman with mittens on because she refused to take them off until April as a point of pride, and what she wrote was short and non-photogenic and perfect. “I stole basil from my neighbor’s box last summer and watered it when they were away,” it said. “We are even.”

At noon, Hanna sent a link with no comment. The council chamber looked different in a video frame; its wood took on a menacing intelligence of its own. The man with the nephew’s name had learned a new word—transparency—and used it as if it had a vowel you could chew. The woman on the committee who had asked the impolite question kept asking it in new clothes. The boy, sitting in a row behind like a small ladder, looked exactly as grown as a person can look without having had to carry a sofa. Syd watched the video, paused, watched again, and turned the sound down to watch a third time because faces had a way of telling stories their mouths wanted to edit. The ring was unworried by the news cycle. It was unworried by the pings of friends sending him screenshots of paragraphs where his name had been turned into a function. He felt, unexpectedly, safe in the quiet disdain of a thing that knew exactly what it was for and could not be asked to dance.

Later he went down to the water with no plan that survived his pockets. There was a patch of grit where the river licked the edge like a dog that had learned manners. He used his shoe to write a circle into the damp and then a line and then a second line not cutting through so much as curving along. He stood over the figure and felt the small private relief that children feel when the world looks briefly like a picture they have understood. A gull watched him as if for once its species approved of a human doing something without consumption as its end. The city made its winter howl and then decided it had made enough noise; the cat sitting in a window above him looked at him with suspicion and then forgave him in a blink. He took his hand out of his pocket and put his palm on the cold rail and chose, for a moment, to think of nothing at all.

When the light went, it went decisively. He walked home with the particular grace of a person who has, for a narrow band of time, no appointment with anyone else’s anger. On the landing the motion sensor did its lazy duty and the bulb came on the way an old memory comes, lagging and then suddenly there. There was no envelope under his door. The ring did not tighten. His phone, turned face down, could not persuade him to reverse it. He set the kettle on and took out a piece of paper as if he had been told to by a music teacher who had always been right. He wrote: I am allowed to decide. He looked at the sentence and thought it a poor start and then a decent foundation. He put the paper in the drawer with the rubber bands and the batteries and the old receipt and felt a part of him tilt toward a sleep where no benches waited and no old men with hair like broom laughed at him from the far end of a century. He went to bed, and the city, relieved of the requirement to be spectacular for a night, climbed into its own skin and sighed.
