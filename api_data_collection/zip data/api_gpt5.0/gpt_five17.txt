The day the wind cracked itself against the windows of the station and the dust went rolling down Main like it had somewhere to be, the chief decided he was going to play the drums. It wasn’t a proclamation he voiced in the morning staff briefing or over formal coffee at the back of the bullpen. It happened in the creased quiet between paperwork and lunch, when his pen hit a dull stop halfway through a sentence—regarding, in the blandest way, an inventory loss from Property—and his eye snagged on a flyer for the Norman Antique & Music Swap pinned to the cork board. A cheap print job, bright orange. The kit in the photo was nowhere near antique. In the picture, the guy behind it had this reckless grin, arms held aloft like he’d just lifted two invisible buckets of water, the cymbals shivering.

He didn’t say it out loud. He folded the pen cap into his palm, as if the factory-fitted clicker was a secret switch nobody had told him about. He stood. He lingered long enough to finish his coffee. On the way to the door, he told Deputy Chief Peña he’d be “a half hour off grid,” which was the phrase he used to keep anybody from asking the innocent where-are-you-going. He adjusted his gun belt, like it suddenly had a different gravity.

He’d been Caleb Whitaker forever, but almost everyone in the county called him Cal, except the Mayor who persisted with “Chief” to his face, like the title was something she held between her teeth and he had to take it from her, politely. He was fifty-two, a weathered fifty-two that looked younger and walked older. Twice divorced. He owned two neckties that weren’t navy or black. He loved the way the town’s elm trees reached for each other across the streets in summer and the way the same streets flattened under the iron sky in winter, the wind coming in so clean you could see the edges of everything.

The swap was set up in the parking lot of the old roller rink out on the east edge of town, the one that had closed before the first Reagan administration and reopened fifteen times as something else. Today there were card tables with jars of old buttons and ashtrays and stacks of LPs that smelled like a warm attic. There were five vendors selling guitars. There were two grinding coffee under a tent. There were three people selling, questionably, guns. A black drum kit squatted like a stubborn animal on the asphalt beside a folding chair that had its own dent.

The man selling it was seventy if he was a day, had a white beard that collected crumbs of conversation and something like sawdust. He didn’t stand when Cal came up, but he did lift his eyes. “You look like a man who’s carried a beat in his chest long enough to get in trouble,” he said, and then smiled like he’d told a joke, which he sort of had.

“I don’t play,” Cal said. His mouth stuck on it. “Not yet.”

“There’s a minute between years,” the old man said. “You can put anything in that minute and it’ll hold.”

The drumheads had scuffs in them. The chrome stands were pitted. The hi-hat was stiff. The Yamaha logo on the bass had peeled to a yama. It was ugly in a way that made Cal love it more. He crouched. He felt the pressure in his knees and the slight pop there, like an old dog settling himself on a rug. He tapped the snare with a stick the man pressed into his hand. He didn’t know what he expected—it was a flat sound, like a room’s heart rate. He tapped again, a little harder. The wind pushed under the tent and rattled a banner. The man said, “Go on.”

Cal had thought about this, without saying so even to himself. He’d looked at drummers before, from high school gym bleachers and the edges of stages in bars, the rare summer he had gone to a show like a person and not like an off-duty thing that might turn on him. He’d watched a drummer once on Campus Corner playing behind a kid who couldn’t sing, noticing how the drummer didn’t look at the crowd or the singer or anything but his own hands, this ferocious privacy to him. Watching had been like knowing a secret. He had wanted the secret since then in a low-grade way that felt indecent and sweet.

He let his hands move because otherwise he’d be stuck there forever. The rack tom replied with a tone that felt like coming back to a street you used to drive. The floor tom was lower, water in a barrel. The hi-hat clicked. The plastic tip of the stick told him things maple would not. He breathed. The man said nothing. A little kid passing with a balloon stopped and stared, and the balloon bobbed at the end of its string like it was nodding approval.

“How much?” Cal asked, too fast, like a teenager trying to act cool and therefore failing.

The price the man said was a joke, then it was real. They haggled like people who already liked each other. The man carried the cymbal stands to Cal’s truck and tied them down himself with a complicated knot that didn’t need to be that complicated. When Cal tried to tip him, the man shook his head. “Just play. There’s enough money running around this town. There’s not enough playing.”

Cal drove back to the station with a drum kit in the bed of his city vehicle, his breath gone shallow with a foolish joy he did not want to interrogate. He parked around back where the cameras only got part of the angle and carried the snare up the stairs like it weighed more than it did.
Upstairs, the bullpen smelled like coffee cut with desperation. Deke Harmon, Lieutenant flat-top with forty pounds of permanent sarcasm, looked up and let out a whistle like a cartoon wolf. “Chief ’s starting a band,” he said. “God help us all.”

Peña’s eyebrows arranged themselves as they always did when something unexpected happened inside the perimeter of her faith in order. “You taking the kit home?” she said. Her voice was cautious but not as careful as it could have been. Cal heard the sounds she was keeping back: neighbors, political optics, privacy, stress relief.

“Eventually,” he said. “Just the snare in my office for now.” He was not sure that sentence was true even as he said it, this borrowed quickness at lying to his own people. He could and did lie for a living, sometimes, but he tried not to to his own. He kept walking.

He set the snare on his couch and looked at it for a long minute. His office had two windows, both looking out on parking lots. His couch was brown the way things in public offices are always the wrong brown. The snare gleamed like a mischief. He sat at his desk and finished the inventory loss report. He authorized a case reopen. He called the Mayor back. He stared at the stack of names of applicants for the academy class. Then he stood, closed his office door, picked up two pencils instead of sticks because it felt like less of a betrayal somehow, and played 1-and-2-and against the steel in a quiet that wasn’t as quiet as it seemed. He felt stupid. He felt a strange, small heat in his shoulders, a returning blood.

When the door opened without a knock and Rizzo, big boy with a laugh like a truck tailgate dropped too fast, walked in, Cal kept his hands still and the pencils on the desk. Rizzo’s eyes went from snare to chief to snare. “Sir.”

“Sergeant.”

“Permission to ask if you’re starting a samba school.”

“Denied,” Cal said. He couldn’t help the corner of his mouth. Rizzo grinned, but he didn’t make a joke. It was respect, or acting.

That night he took the kit home to his small rental on Trout Avenue, the one that had a garage whose door stammered when it rose and then thought better of coming down. He wrestled the bass drum out of the bed like a body and felt older than his spine could carry. He set it all up in the garage, arranged the pieces like they were a sentence he knew the grammar for but not the words. He looked up a video and watched a kid half his age explain how to sit. He ignored the video and sat how he wanted, because he’d earned that right by living, and because his knees were bad. The hi-hat pedal squealed. He spread a towel under it like a cheap rug.

He started slow. His hands wanted to do everything at once. His feet wanted to do nothing. He untangled himself a little. He laughed once at the foolishness of it, then stopped laughing because laughter was a thin shield and the feeling that came after it was better. The neighborhood had a modest dignity about nighttime; people hung one more shirt up on a hanger and turned one more light off and that was the thrill of it. Cal played so quiet at first you could have convinced yourself it was a washing machine in the spin cycle. Then he pressed his right foot down and struck the snare and the hi-hat in a ragged, rough thing that was not a groove. It was not a anything yet, but it was not not a thing.

The first complaint came at 8:43 PM, logged by dispatch like any other noise complaint even though the address should have meant she would roll her eyes and let it sit until the hour, which was the city’s line. It rolled instead to Officer Brinkley, who called Cal first, careful as a cat. “Chief, we got a… neighbor called says she’s hearing something like construction.”

“I’ll take care of it,” Cal said. He didn’t say I am the noise. He didn’t say tell her to get used to it, which was beneath him, and also untrue.

He sat again. He fitted his sticks back between his fingers. He tried to do it like the kid on the video, which made him feel crazy in his own bones. He tapped on the rim. He tapped on the head. He moved his left hand over to the hi-hat and then back, let that motion be nothing, and then something, and then the something turned into a doorway. He took a half-step through. He tried to sit on the 2 and the 4. The drum said no, then yes. He felt his shoulders charge with the pleasure of being wrong and then right and then wrong again, like falling and catching yourself on a railing nobody told you was there. The old dog barked two houses down. It was all right.

He’d been a drummer in high school for precisely one month, if you counted the borrowing of a friend's sticks and the sneaking into the band room during lunch to tap on a practice pad that had been chewed by somebody’s anxiety. He’d been told by a band director that his wrists were all wrong. He’d been told by his father that men who drum in Oklahoma end up in Austin and men who end up in Austin come home later to borrow money. Cal had nodded at all of it with the face of a son and then he hadn’t thought about it again except he had thought about it, all the time. He had gone and been a cop instead. How simple that sentence was; how not simple it had been.

He stopped after an hour. He rolled the garage door down, the stammer grateful to be used for something. He made eggs he didn’t want and stood over the stove and ate them with a spoon like he was a thief in his own kitchen. He texted his daughter June, who was nineteen and presently convinced that dads were a complicated idea you could opt out of, unlike gravity. He said: how’s the dorm. She responded with a picture of a terrifying tower of laundry and a caption that said: pray for us. He sent a drum emoji and then immediately regretted it. She didn’t reply to that.

Over the next week, people at the station did that thing where they turned their embarrassment into jokes in order to save everybody from it. Deke said, “Band name, Chief. C’mon. Two syllables, starts with N. Norman N—” and then stopped because he’d almost said something he would have to apologize for in sensitivity training. Rizzo said, “Snared you, didn’t it?” Peña said, “The optics,” and then pinched her nose. Cal smiled and played it all down except when he couldn’t and then he did not.

He hadn’t planned to tell his step-brother. He hadn’t planned to tell anybody who knew everything that hurt him too quickly, which is the list of people who lived with you in a house where a certain smell of a certain dinner meant a certain fight was coming. But Milo called the second Friday of drums, from somewhere in West Texas where the wind never stopped talking. “I got a gig in your general area,” he said, like Oklahoma was northern Mexico he might bump into by accident. “Three weeks. The Red Lion. If it’s still even there.”

“It is,” Cal said. He could hear traffic in Milo’s phone or the sound of something else fast. He could hear the tone Milo used when he wanted to ask for something but thought maybe not asking would be noble. “You staying here,” he said. “If you want.”

Milo laughed, a sound with three syllables and an apology in it. “I’ll take the couch if your couch doesn’t prove me ineligible.”

“It’s brown,” Cal said. “Which is a crime, but not that kind.”

Milo and Cal were the same age, more or less, and had not grown up together even though they had. Their parents had married when they were twelve and thirteen, which meant they had exchanged two years’ worth of blind boyhearted insults and then gone to their separate rooms forever. They had reunited sometimes over grief or beer or the kind of trouble that knocks on both doors at once. Milo could play five instruments with a mercy that made it look like he was forgiving them for being difficult. He wrote songs that didn’t make him one thing or another so much as they made him Milo. He recorded none of them in the old days, because who had money for that? He recorded most of them now, who knew where, on a phone that had more song in it than his first three guitars combined, and sent the demos through the ether to people who said they would call him back. Sometimes they did. Sometimes he hung up first.

The second noise complaint came Saturday afternoon, because Saturday afternoons in Norman were partly for kids playing in the leaf piles and partly for adults honoring the sanctity of naps. Cal had set up the kit in the living room for some reason he could not explain even to himself and was doing that thing where he let the hi-hat keep time like a pacemaker while he learned to split his hands from his feet. The call came from Dispatch again and he wiped his face on his forearm and answered.

“Chief,” said the voice, and then he heard the rest of the sentence before he heard it: “We got a complaint. Another. Just letting you know someone’s on the way so you don’t get surprised.”

“Who’d you send?” he said, dropping the sticks. One rolled under the couch, and he didn’t move because somehow that felt like losing a small battle he could not afford to lose.

“Brinkley again,” she said. He could hear the faint clatter of keys in her background, the ambient panic of a half staff. “He’ll stay in the street. He’s cool.”

“Thank you,” he said. Then he sighed and went outside. Brinkley stayed in his squad with the lights off. He would have gotten out for anyone else, would have hung his hat on the shining fact of being a policeman in his own town. For his chief he stayed in the car and rolled the window down. His face was tender when he said, “I can pull this off the board, sir. The lady on 300 block doesn’t like the sound of anything but Swiffer WetJet commercials. Her husband wrote it in his diary in ’98.”

Cal looked at the house number and at the way the light fell across the top of his own roof and at the way his shadow sat on the lawn. He was tired already. “Do you play anything, Officer?”

“Me? I had a phase where I thought I was a poet,” Brinkley said, with the brave honesty of someone who assumes you’re not going to make a weapon of it. “Didn’t stick.”

“I’m keeping it under,” Cal said. “You can say that in your… radio.” He smiled so the joke softened.

At the station Monday morning, the Mayor leaned over an email printout like it was the Declaration of Independence gone wrong. She was compact and short-haired and wore shoes that made no noise when she moved, which was unsettling. “There’s never the right time for this,” she said, not looking up. “Noise is politics, Chief. It’s always been politics. But when the noise is you—” She glanced at him then. The look was not unkind. “The optics,” she said, and handed it to him.

He read. The letter was written in a voice that had read other letters and learned how to sound like them. The words carefully did not say Chief but used his address in a way that made it obvious anyway. It praised his service, because that is how you start with a man in his fifties. It fretted about the decorum of the office and the sanctity of nights and the impression left on “the children.” It cited a city ordinance as though adding numbers to a sentence made it law in a different way. It was signed with a flourish like the end of a wedding invitation.

“I can tell you I’ll keep it down,” he said. “I can tell you I’ll stop, if that’s what this gets to.” He felt his voice fall a rung and cursed it for that. He stood taller. “But I am not disrespecting anything. I am learning an instrument. Badly.”

“I know how this town thinks,” the Mayor said. “I know how it thinks it thinks. I know how it pretends to think. Play. Just—play in the hours the church ladies aren’t watching.”

He smiled then because she had given him a corridor. “That’s never.”

“That’s midnight to midnight every other Tuesday in a leap year,” she said. She actually smiled then, a small one that made her look her own age instead of older than everyone.

He carried the drum kit back out to the squad garage for a day or two to rest the block. He sat in the driver’s seat with the radio low and his hands on the steering wheel at ten and two and drummed there, a silent practice that looked like worry. The cadets coming in for physicals nodded at him with those bright, eager faces people have before they’re told to disassemble and reassemble their expectations in an order that violates both grammar and good sense. He yelled at no one. He nodded back. He remembered what he looked like when he started and, in a flash, what he had become to himself when he didn’t plan it.

His ex-wife called him that evening, the first one, Tara, who lived up near Edmond with a dentist who wrote her poems on Post-it notes and stuck them to the coffee machine like notes at a crime scene. “Please tell me the rumors are true,” she said, laughter already halfway into her mouth.

“I’m playing the drums,” he said. He might as well have said, I’m learning to garden or I’m trying to cook a soufflé. He fully expected a joke. The one she told surprised him.

“You always had good time,” she said. “You were impossible to live with and you were good at holding time. For a two am colic. For the one car seat we could afford and the one where I had to strap June in with a scarf and a prayer. You counted down from ten better than any doctor. Remember that.”

“It feels stupid.”

“Everything feels stupid until it doesn’t,” she said. “Except yoga, which always feels stupid and is also good for you. Don’t give the drum to the town before you’ve given it to yourself.”

He went to the garage. He played. The rhythm came and then went like a train that wasn’t stopping at this station, not tonight. He drank a beer and then another and then put the bottles down because noise and alcohol go to the same parties and lead each other astray. He slept badly. He woke to a message from Milo that said, simply: wrote something. Might be for you.

He opened it in the lull between a meeting about an overtime grant and a conversation with a retired cop who liked to come in and tell the living how to do their jobs. The file loaded slow. It was recorded in a motel room, you could tell from the echo in the corners and the way the air conditioner’s breath pushed into the right channel. Milo’s voice was lower than it had been when they were boys and had the scratch of having been used. The first line said, “The badge is a drum you never meant to play,” which was both true and too on the nose by half, and then the second line cut diagonally and found a grace in the turn: “But your hands remember before they were trained.” It was a waltz that pretended it wasn’t, then gave up pretending. It was simple and then complicated, not because it had to be, but because life insisted. It was suddenly in his blood, a map unfurling.

He wrote back: You’re a showoff. He wrote back again: It’s good, damn you. He wrote nothing else. He played it again. He listened to where the drums should be. He knew where the drums should be and that knowledge burned him a little with the joy of knowing and the pain of not yet being able to put his hands there.

In the afternoon he walked the floor because he always did when the building got too small for him. He checked the interrogation rooms as if someone had left a chunk of time there. He liked their sterile honesty, which was different than goodness. He liked the way the vents hummed and the way the one window that looked out on the alley framed the sky in a geometry that made it seem like maybe the sky was built by a person. He ran into Harman by the Family Violence detective’s desk and listened to the latest debacle the county was dealing with and felt his rage spool up and then spool down like there was a gear in him somebody had thoughtfully included without telling him. He had taught himself to lower it from eight to two in under a minute. He walked back. He turned the song on again through his phone speaker too low to let the rest of the office hear. He closed his eyes.

The wind had gone kind again. It made the flag at the entrance snap like a tape measure. Someone wheeled a cart of file boxes dead center down the hallway and nearly mowed Cal down. He laughed, sidestepped, put his hand out to steady a box that didn’t need steadying, and the hand that came back and thanked him belonged to an officer from the University PD who had once cried in front of him in a patrol car the morning after, and none of that needed to be said or should be, and wasn’t.

He did not practice that night. He went to see his daughter. She had texted him after lunch: come to the library bring snacks. He brought the wrong snacks and she ate them anyway because she still loved him regardless. They sat at a round table under a light that made the books look wise. She worked calculus. He tried not to think about lines and beats and sequences. She said, while not looking up from her notebook, “I heard you’re playing the drums.”

He said, “Who told you.”

She said, “It’s a small town. The town told me.”

“It’s fine,” he said, and then, because he didn’t want to be fine, he said, “I want to be good.”

She tapped her pencil. He watched the way she moved her fingers and thought about how hands make futures. “You were good at teaching me to ride a bike,” she said. “You didn’t hold on too long.”

“That was mostly you not wanting me to,” he said.

“Don’t hold on too long,” she said, consequence of being nineteen and giving out advice like the world would be smart enough to take it just because it was sound. “If you’re going to fail, fail loud.”

He laughed, too loud for the library. The student in the rolling chair glared at them and then smiled because the glare had been its own theatre. June glanced up then. He saw her face in full and saw his own mother there, and himself too, which was odd and not odd. She touched his wrist, that touch kids discard when they’re twelve and reclaim for other things when they’re adults, and he wanted nothing more than to stay that minute.

Friday, he thought about not going into the station. The thought itself frightened him. He went. He took a call with the DA. He took a tour of the holding cells he’d toured a thousand times, like they were going to do a magic trick for him if only he was patient. He found himself, toward afternoon, standing at the door of the briefing room while the traffic unit did their weekly after-action. He listened to men and women who were twenty and thirty and forty talk about intersections and incident rate and how to make a stop without making an enemy. He wanted to tell them something wise about compassion, and then decided what he wanted to do was shut up and listen. He did. He clapped when they were done because sometimes you should clap even if the reason for the meeting was an ugly one—it tells people we do this together.

There was a giggle behind his back. He turned. Deke had pulled up a drummer meme on his phone, the one where you hit everything and it sounds like nothing, and held it like it was evidence. “You’re not even a little curious about percussion, Chief. You’re a lot-curious.”

“I am,” he said, surprising Deke by saying it. He put his hand on Deke’s shoulder, then took it off because that hand had outrun his sense. “There’s a jam night at Red Lion next week. I might go. You should come with me and laugh when I fall off the stool.”

“I already did that in my head,” Deke said, but the meanness was not real. He was making a seat for the idea he might go, and he did not bash his knee on it getting away. “If you get good we’re making you drum at the Christmas party in the parking garage.”

“Nightstick on a trash can,” Cal said, and Deke rolled his eyes and went away. It was the kind of banter that kept the building from rusting shut.

The night Milo pulled in, it was raining, a gentle, miserly rain that made the pavement smell complicated. He parked a truck that was technically blue the way a bruise is technically a color. He swung his boots out and stood like he was finishing the last sentence of a letter he’d been writing in his head for years. His hug was an assault and then a truce. He took one look at the drum kit set up in the living room like an altar and raised his hands. “I take back every slander I’ve ever thought.”

“Just the thoughts,” Cal said. “Not the words?”

“The words were art,” Milo said, and the grin went away and the face he had when he was asleep came on. He touched the cymbal, this reverent, silly tap, like kissing the top of a child’s head. He took his boots off without being told; some manners don’t leak out even when you try. “Play me what you think you know.”

“What I think I know,” Cal said. “Not what I know.”

“Same difference,” Milo said. “Show me the map you think this town is.”

Cal sat. The sticks complicated themselves in his hands. He set the count in his head. He felt silly counting. He did anyway. He started 1-and-2-and like a man carrying two buckets of water he didn’t want to spill. The hi-hat clicked like civilized conversation. The snare interrupted like a kid at the table. The kick was a dog under the porch. He focused on not losing the hi-hat, on keeping it walking, and when he thought about something else the hi-hat tripped, and when he pulled it up it was the snare that fell. He swore. Milo laughed in the soundless way older brothers laugh when you break a stick throwing it into a tree.

“No,” Milo said softly, then put his fingers on the top of Cal’s shoulders. A simple weight. He did not say relax, which was the word that makes relaxation impossible. He did not tell Cal to stop doing six things with four limbs. He just put that weight there and the sentence that was Cal’s body rearranged itself by a degree or two. “Play. With your bad time and your good intent. Look, the song doesn’t care. It’s just a room you walk in. It’s already a room.”

“I got one complaint last week where I wasn’t playing,” Cal said, halfway through a measure that was failing and a measure that was not. “The lady said she could hear me thinking about it.”

“Everyone can hear everyone thinking,” Milo said. “It’s Oklahoma. The walls made of air and bragging.”

Cal managed four bars without the hi-hat coming apart. He took a breath. He listened the way he was learning to listen, which was different than listening to a confession or a patrol sergeant’s excuse. The difference was he was both perpetrator and witness here, and that jangled, and he liked it, and he would pay for that pleasure later. The kick found it’s way in. The way people talk about groove feels like a lie until it suddenly isn’t. There it was. He chased it and of course lost it, but the losing didn’t matter as much as it would have yesterday.

“Play this,” Milo said, and hummed a pattern in his throat. He had always been able to do that, to translate his wants into a sound that wasn’t a want. Cal tried. “Close enough,” Milo said. “We’ll put you behind a loud singer, nobody will know.”

“Nobody will know,” Cal said, and thought of the letter and the Mayor and the three officers who didn’t want him to walk a beat with them because they said it made people nervous to see the Chief out there. Nobody knows anything except everybody knows everything.

They ate. They drank. Milo played him songs he had no right to play him for free. Cal listened to the one that was maybe his, felt around for the places where the drums would go—the floor tom would live like a pulse under the line about the laundromat at 3 am, the kick would argue kindly with the phrase that went “driving home, lights in the ditch like waiting eyes.” He didn’t say any of it. He went to sleep with the sound in his head, which was not a sound you could make into a diagram.

He was early to the station in the morning. The rain had washed the wind out of the sky. He sat at his desk with a silence that wasn’t. Peña came in with a sheaf of forms and a look that made him wish he were a younger man or an older man, anything but this in-between age that made you never sure if you’d done enough or too much. “We have a problem at Brown Hill,” she said, and it was a problem, one he knew would demand him stand in front of a camera at five and tell the town things in a way that made them want to go make dinner instead of go buy a gun. He couldn’t think about drums when the thing was this. He thought about drums anyway, because that’s how brains are cruel and kind; they keep playing two things at once until you learn how to be both.

At five he stood under hot lights that made the sweat on his lip smart. He said what a man says when a thing happens that is bad but not uncommon, terrible but not novel: condolences, ongoing, we appreciate, we will. He used the right words because the wrong ones are worse even if they feel more human. He answered a question from a blog that wasn’t a blog anymore so much as it was a machine that ate outrage and exhaled it in a shape people could share with their relatives. He said nothing he would regret except a line at the end that came out of him without asking. “We’re people in here,” he said, surprised to hear it too. “We are. We mess up. We try again. Try to give us the dignity of that. And we will try to honor it.” The Mayor looked at him later and said, “I don’t hate that,” which for her was a benediction.

He drove home with the radio off. He thought of the drum as a friend in another room, smoking a cigarette and reading a book, waiting to be asked if it wanted a coffee. He walked in and Milo was on the couch writing with his knees up, the way he had since 1992. He looked up. “You want to play?”

“I want to play and also kill everyone and also sleep,” Cal said, aware he had stepped into a mood he did not quite control.

“Two out of three,” Milo said. “Pick.”

They played softly. One of the neighbors yelled without venom, “Love it!” which is, in some ways, more dangerous than a complaint. They laughed. They stopped. They started again. The night went on with them in it, the two boys who had become these men. Cal hit a measure square and simple and sat in it. Milo let out a noise of approval that was half animal.

“Remember the roller rink,” Milo said out of nowhere, in the pocket of the groove, as if the groove made remembering possible. “The last time they played real disco before someone’s dad walked in with a big switch and changed the song to ‘American Pie.’ That girl with the feathered hair, the way she put her hand in yours.”

“That was you,” Cal said automatically, then remembered it wasn’t. He had watched that girl from a safe distance. It had been Milo who had put a hand, who had done all the putting of hands, who had hung his heart on a hundred hooks and got it back cleaner or dirtier each time. He had become a cop. He had put his hands on people in other ways. It was not the same, and it was what it was.

They kept going until the clock did something interesting and then came back to idle. There it was, a small thing that wanted to be larger. Cal played it again and again, faster and slower, until he learned what his own wrists were willing to do and what they would not. He slept later with the kit in the living room and the window open to let the town in.

Sunday morning he woke to church bells from down the block, which is a thing that happens in a town that hasn’t decided what time is. He made coffee. He considered going to a church not because he needed to, but because churches are sometimes like libraries: they let you sit and think without charging you rent. He didn’t go. He sat on his front step picking paint off the railing. He watched two kids invent a sword fight with sticks that were not swords. He smiled at the neighbor he’d offended with his playing. She smiled back with the kind of smile that says I will forgive you if you bake me a cake. Milo came out barefoot like he was the person you were allowed to be barefoot in front of, and sat, and stared at Oklahoma.

“What’s the real reason,” Milo asked, “you want to play the drums.”

Cal could lie, and sometimes he did. He could shave the truth, and sometimes he did that too. He could say midlife this or stress that or bucket list which is a phrase that had always annoyed him because it felt like agreeing to die one line at a time. He said, “I want to do one thing where the success is not catching a worse man than me. I want to make a noise that doesn’t hurt anyone. I want to feel like the glue, not the hammer.”

“Glue, not hammer,” Milo repeated, because he was a thief of phrases. “Good.”

“And,” Cal said, to his own surprise, “I want to be bad at something and not get fired.”

Milo laughed. “We can arrange both: being bad and not being fired.”

“I already arranged the first,” Cal said. He took a sip of coffee and winced at it and drank it anyway. “You ever think we’re just moving in circles on an old record because we’re too scared to flip it over?”

“It’s the same album on both sides,” Milo said. “Different scratches.”

They went inside. They moved furniture because a carpet wanted to be under the kit, and the kit wanted it too. They measured with their feet. They cursed the couch’s refusal to agree with the angle of the wall. They pressed their palms to the floor and felt the day rising off it like heat. Cal put the song on again. They tried to orbit it, the two of them, one relentless ring and one small moon. It was not good yet, and it was better than it had any right to be. The kit rattled like a car with one bolt missing, which is to say it rattled the way everything rattles in Norman if you listen with the window down.

In the evening, when the town’s light went the color of toast and then gave up, Cal stepped out to get the mail he never wanted. He turned his head toward town, the little saw-edged skyline where the courthouse sat and the grain elevator claimed a vertical space the horizon otherwise didn’t offer, and he thought, not in words and not because he wanted to, of a museum. A gallery. The new one finally open again after the roof fiasco. A place he had been as a policeman and not as a person. The thought passed like a cloud. He went back inside.

Milo was asleep on the couch, pen still in his hand. The drum kit gleamed in the low light like a cousin of a car. There was something in the room now that had not been there before, weightless and heavy at the same time. Cal stood in the doorway and felt a day in him shift its furniture. He did not move. He did not speak. The neighbors did not complain. The wind lifted and set the leaves down like it was finally tired. He stood there until standing was the most honest thing he had done all week. Then he went to bed and dreamed of a metronome the size of a building, swinging against the sky, and himself, very small, keeping time with it, and not for anyone but himself.On Monday he woke before the alarm and lay there long enough to count the four beats between the radiator’s clicks and the train horn far off, a kind of conversation he had never bothered to overhear. The metronome dream clung to the inside of his skull like a sticker he didn’t want to peel all the way off. He made coffee that tried to be strong and landed instead at serviceable. Milo padded in, hair on end like he had been arguing with a pillow, and drank his cup in three unwise swallows, then said nothing for a while, which was one of the gifts of their kinship: the quiet could be a thing you shared, not a thing you apologized for.

At the station the morning tasted like old donuts and printer toner. The inbox had been breeding over the weekend; the subject lines made a kind of gritty poem. Peña tapped the doorjamb with two knuckles and slid in like she was avoiding a tripwire. She laid a manila folder on his desk with a care that suggested either a newborn or a grenade. “I handled most of it,” she said, and the way her mouth handled the word most made him sit up straighter.

The letter inside had city letterhead and a tone that made the paper feel heavier than it was. The ethics commission wanted to know if there had been personal use of a city vehicle in the transporting of personal property, specifically, a drum kit. It was both absurd and correct. Cal felt heat come up the back of his neck like he’d swallowed a match. The thing that irritated him wasn’t the ask; it was the bruise of being seen doing something he had done without a full plan for being seen. He flipped the page over and waited for the second blow. There it was, the copy of a phone photo from someone’s backyard that caught the blue of the city truck and the black circle of the Yamaha bass head—yama—from a mean angle.

“Councilor Ruggles forwarded it,” Peña said. “He added a smiley face at the end of his email, which I’m going to hold a hearing about inside my own soul.”

“What’s the play,” Cal asked, because he had learned a long time ago that the people you hire to be better than you at something deserve to be asked before you decide to be a cowboy.

“I already told them you paid the ten dollars we require when anyone takes a city vehicle home overnight,” she said. “Because I have decided you did. I’ll move it from petty cash if you want to make it literal. I added that you’ve taken the kit home in your own truck since then. I also added three lines about how we want our employees to have healthy outlets that do not involve felony charges.”

He looked at her the way you look at a person who has kept you from bleeding in a way you didn’t know you could bleed. “I did pay,” he said, which was true in the way that mattered, even if it hadn’t happened yet. “I will pay again just to be in the neighborhood of the truth.”

“You’re going to get your picture in the paper anyway,” Peña said, in that voice of hers that put bracing sugar on the rim of a bitter thing. “You can smile or you can scowl. Either way they’ll sell ads around your head. Might as well choose the face.”

He nodded. He put the paper back in the folder, the way you tuck a wild thing back in a box so it won’t startle you all morning. Out of habit he reached for the pen to sign something, anything, the way the hands sometimes ask to do a thing just to prove they are still allowed. The phone rang. It was the Mayor’s assistant, which meant the Mayor had something she needed to say she might regret. He picked up.

“There’s an opening at the museum tonight,” the Mayor said, not asking how his weekend had been, which he respected. “They rehung the local artists gallery. They want a police presence because last time somebody ‘accidentally’ took a sculpture the size of a toddler. Also because this town trusts a badge more than it trusts itself. If you’re there, people behave. If your people are there, it’s fine. If you’re there, they’ll also tell themselves a good story about their tax dollars.”

He did the mental dance where he checked his calendar, checked his stamina, checked the little gauge inside that said how much he could stand being looked at like a painting. “I’ll go,” he said. “I’ll bring someone who can talk about art without sounding like a man describing a transmission.”

“Bring no guns near the Calder knock-off,” she said, and hung up with a click that didn’t feel like the end of something so much as the middle.

He took Harmon with him because Deke had a wife who taught kindergarten and could identify the color teal as a separate entity from green. On the way out Deke said, “The museum, huh. You going to domesticate us with culture? My mom took me there once to see an exhibit on chairs. Chairs. I sat on one and a docent materialized from nowhere and asked me to sit on the floor instead.”

“Sit on the floor, Lieutenant,” Cal said. “I’m asking you as your boss and your friend.”

The museum made a sound only nice buildings make, a shush that was not an order, just a suggestion. The new gallery had white walls pretending not to be walls so much as air that consented to hold things. People in sweaters moved from piece to piece as though passing through agreed-upon weather. There was a trio in the corner making a structure out of small instruments—wine glasses sung with wet fingers, a tambourine with one broken jingle, a wooden crate you hit with the heel of your hand. The room tolerated them without liking them. A student in a black dress stood next to a row of metronomes on a plinth, all ticking with stubborn purpose, each out of phase enough that standing between them was like being in a small, civil storm.

Cal stood there too long. The music they made together and apart scratched a part of his brain that had not been scratched by a piece of art outside of a courtroom exhibit. He found his head swaying a fraction, the way people sway when they decide they will not dance. Deke nudged him. “You’re going to start syncing traffic lights to this, aren’t you.”

A man with a goatee that had read books introduced himself as the curator. He thanked the police department, thanked their presence. He pointed at a photograph of wheat and sky and a single tornado rope that looked, perversely, gentle. “That’s the thing,” he said. “You make something that looks like one thing but it is also the other. Calm and not. That’s where the life is.”

Cal did his short, polite laugh. He turned and found himself face to face with Mrs. Loretta Kemp, who taught sixth-grade English in this town for thirty years and had taught him to diagram sentences and to look for the verb that was hiding its muscles under a cheap shirt. “Caleb Whitaker,” she said, using the whole of him. “You were always beating your pencil on your desk. I should have seen this coming.”

He felt his ears heat. “You took my pencil away once for a whole week,” he said. “I had to learn to think in my head instead of out loud.”

“It didn’t take,” she said, and patted his forearm. “Play loud when you play. The walls of this town can take it. They pretend they can’t.”

He wanted to tell her about the letter, about the way a signature can weigh more than a person. He wanted to tell her about the waltz in his phone and how he was failing the floor tom quietly in his own house. He said instead, “Thank you for making me learn what a preposition was so I could understand when to get under a thing instead of on top of it.”

By the time the two hours of being present in a room full of looking people was done, he had been congratulated for the press conference, admonished for his haircut, asked if the Police Department would please send officers to the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot as though a turkey could violate any ordinance by running. He took it all as if it were weather. On the way out he paused at the metronomes again. One of them had stopped. The student in black reached out without looking and restarted it with a flick that was almost tenderness. He went home with that gesture in his eye.

Milo had made pasta in his kitchen and left the kind of mess in the sink that could make a lesser man change his locks. He looked entirely unrepentant and held a fork out to Cal like an offertory. “Tell me about the art,” he said around his own mouthful. “Did a naked person make you feel like God is real.”

“The art was a lot of clocks that refused to agree,” Cal said, taking the fork and twirling and eating over the sink in an unlovely way. “There was a tornado dressed like a calendar. Mrs. Kemp told me to play loud.”

“She’s right,” Milo said. “You can’t sneak your way into rhythm. It doesn’t respect timidity. Speaking of loud: Wednesday is jam night.”

A knot formed in Cal’s chest in the shape of the Red Lion’s doorway. He had walked in that door fifteen times in uniform and twice without. People fell quiet when the uniform entered. People ignored him and then apologized for ignoring him when he wasn’t in uniform, which was worse. “I could just go and listen the first time,” he said, and heard himself being a version of himself he despised.

“You could,” Milo said, unbothered. “Or you could do something stupid that is also honest. You don’t have to play the whole song. You can sit down for two minutes and then stand up and let your body figure out how badly it wants to do it again. There are no medals.”

“I’ll bring an officer to clap politely in case the crowd is rough,” Cal said. “We’ll put him on the front row like a security blanket.”

“You have a front row at the Red Lion,” Milo said, using his beer bottle to indicate the air. “That’s charming. It’s all stools that wobble and a bartender who will make you feel like you hurt her by ordering a water.”

Tuesday wanted to be a quiet day and failed. He wrote the memo about the Brown Hill follow-up the way you write a letter to a family you will never meet. He sat in with the training unit and listened to the part where they taught a thing called Tactical Breathing, which struck him as the closest the department could come to admitting that sometimes what saves you isn’t your weapon or your partner, it’s counting to four on the inhale and six on the exhale. In the afternoon a call came in from a street he knew too well, one of those duplexes that soak up despair like a sponge and squeeze it out on a schedule. He went because sometimes he still did and because the younger ones look different when the chief shows up and you can change the temperature with your presence.

It was a domestic with the volume turned up, the kind of scared that gets loud instead of quiet. A woman with her hair up in a clip that was losing its battle had a red streak down her cheek and a man with a busted lip had the posture men adopt when they are trying to look like they don’t know how to make their hands behave. Cal stood in the doorway and felt the urge to knock on his own way of being. He lowered his voice and slowed it and found himself counting without counting, his words landing on twos and fours, leaving the ones alone for the breath to do the heavy lifting. He could see the man’s shoulders drop a fraction when the beat became something you could rest in, not fight. “Sit,” he said, a simple, useful verb, and the two of them sat because it was less humiliating than the alternatives. He left the house later with a promise to call, which felt like one of the lies the job taught you to tell with your whole heart. In the car he laughed once at nothing, a bark that startled the radio, and then he took the long way back and drummed the heel of his palm on the steering wheel in a pattern that didn’t have a name but kept him from returning too quickly to the building where paper pretended to be action.

At home that night he and Milo played the waltz badly and then less badly. At one point the kick drum and the word “never” in the second verse got tangled up like two dogs walking in opposite directions with a leash between them, and Milo stopped singing and laughed into his wrist and said, “We should sell tickets to this disaster because it’s good television.” Cal felt the embarrassment flare and then he let it be, did not try to push it down or explain it away. He let it sit like an unfriendly guest at his table and then, like many unfriendly guests, it got bored and left. He found the two-and again. The song held.

Wednesday he wore jeans and a shirt with buttons that weren’t official. Peña looked at him like she was measuring the distance between duty and personhood with her teeth. “You heading somewhere,” she asked. She knew where.

“I am going to a bar to humiliate myself in front of taxpayers,” he said.

“Humiliate yourself for yourself, Chief,” she said. “Let the taxpayers pay for the lights.”

He thought of asking her to come, in the way you think of leaping off a good bridge into water you are fairly sure will catch you. She would not come; that was not the relationship they had or the one this town permitted. She gave him a paper anyway as if she had come. It recommended changes to the overtime assignments for football weekends. He took it like a talisman.

The Red Lion’s sign made the lion look like it had eaten something it regretted. The bar itself smelled like nostalgia’s armpit, which was oddly comforting. A chalkboard announced jam night with a chalk that had faded from white to eulogy. People who knew how to pretend to be indifferent stood in little clumps, their instruments collapsed against their bodies like beloved problems. The stage was a low rectangle decorated with a rug that had seen more bottoms of shoes than a road. The bartender nodded at Milo like he was a bill that had been paid promptly fifteen years in a row.

Brinkley showed up, hands jammed in his jacket, and took a seat where he could see the door because cops are not creative. Deke came in late and pretended to be cool, which meant he was not. June was not there because June was nineteen and had rules; but as he was uncoiling his own cheap guitar cable to feel like he belonged, his phone vibrated. A text. A clip from one of June’s friends’ feeds. The inside of the Red Lion, shaky. The caption: Chief Watch. He felt the blood leave his ears and then return. He looked around and could not find the camera that filmed him; he raised one hand anyway, halfway to a wave like a surrender. He put the phone face down.

They didn’t call names. They went by impulse and under-the-breath arrangement. A boy with a trumpet that didn’t look old enough to have survived a bus ride counted off a blues and then refused to play blues with it, wandering the notes like a person unsure of their groceries in a strange store. A woman with wrist tattoos played guitar with a delicacy that made the hecklers swallow their heckles. The drummer for the house—older, with wrists that had learned humility—sat like a confidant and kept everything from falling off the table. Cal watched the drummer’s left hand do a thing that woke envy in him, this subtle ghosting, little pressures between the ones that made the groove slink instead of stomp. He filed it away like a tip whispered in a locker room.

Milo leaned in and said, “We’ll ask for a waltz. The bar will forgive us because they already forgave me a thousand times for worse sins.” Cal’s mouth dried. His right foot went absent the way loyal dogs sometimes hide during fireworks. He looked at the ceiling. He looked at Brinkley. Brinkley did the smallest fist, like he was not actually cheering, who would do that, not a grown man.

“Any three,” the drummer said into the mic, bored and kind, and Milo raised his guitar and nodded. The drummer looked at Cal then. His eyes did the fast math: older guy, cop, not here to take anybody’s spot, carrying a hunger in his shoulders like serious men do when they let themselves want something. He tipped his head toward the seat.

The stool was taller than it needed to be. The snare was tuned higher than his at home, a tight talker. The sticks were a little heavier. He could feel the room push its air at him. He counted one-two-three, one-two-three in his head and then said not out loud, for god’s sake do not lose the one. Milo started his first line without dramatics. Cal put the hi-hat on two and three with a polite kiss and let the kick say hello on the one and then keep itself from barging. He put the snare on two like a soft door. The first four bars were delirium, the kind that feels like falling but is just your body remembering gravity. The fifth bar asked him to prove he had not just gotten lucky. He got it wrong, but only a little, like a kid putting a shoe on the wrong foot. The room did not punish him for it. The bartender tilted her head and cleaned a glass with a rag that had seen too much and nodded a fraction.

By the second verse his foot came home. By the bridge the kick and Milo’s “lights in the ditch” line found each other and smiled. He felt the inside of his chest settle like a building finally noticing the wind had dropped. A guy at a side table clapped on two and four with the reckless enthusiasm of a person who had never once been shamed for clapping. It helped. It hurt, then helped again. Cal let himself make the fill Milo had hummed in the kitchen, just once, just the simple one, tom-tom-snare like a sentence you do not garnish. He hit it a hair late and then the next measure a hair early and he rode between those hairs until the end.

When it was over, the applause was not charity. It wasn’t a thunder either. It was the doppler swell of a room that had not expected to forgive someone and did anyway. He stood like a man who had just realized his legs were attached. He wanted to bow and then laughed at himself for wanting it and he did not bow. He let the sticks sit on the snare and seat themselves. The house drummer clapped him on the back with a hand that had calmed many a fool. “Not bad, Chief,” he said, no sarcasm. “You spent some time listening before you came up.”

“I spent a lifetime listening to different kinds of noise,” Cal said, and surprised himself with the truth of it.

Milo did two more songs, one of them one Cal did not play and watched instead, hands flat on his thighs. Deke, who had started the evening prepared to make the kind of joke Baldwin might have appreciated if Baldwin had ever had beer with Deke, kept his mouth in order and only said, “Well, you didn’t drop your stick, which is what I was waiting for,” and then, more quietly, “You looked like you wanted to be there.”

Outside the air had that cleaned-slate feeling bar air has, like getting out of a car that has been playing the same radio station too loud. A man in a hat you could have knocked a nail in with came up to Cal, and for a moment Cal braced his shoulders for a complaint. The man stuck his hand out. Cal shook it on reflex and almost ordered him to put his other hand where he could see it, the old muscle memory. The man’s palm was callused in a way that said his softness took work. “I wrote that letter,” he said without ceremony.

“What letter,” Cal said, and then felt the one lie roll off him like a cheap coat. “The letter,” he corrected.

“I don’t like noise,” the man said. “I don’t like a lot of things I can’t control. My wife says I built a house out of quiet and then I decided the neighborhood had to match. I still don’t like noise. But that thing you did in there—that wasn’t noise. That was a—” He searched for it like it might be under the table. “It was a good racket.”

Cal looked at his face and found what people always said was there only if you gave it a second to rise, the boy he had been. “I’ll keep it in the hours,” he said.

“You will,” the man said. He looked like he wanted to apologize in a way he did not have the muscle for. He settled for “You looked happy, which I don’t think anyone has looked like in there since 2009.”

Milo packed his guitar the way you tuck in a child you know will kick the blanket off anyway. “He’s going to quit his job and go on tour,” he said to the air, loud enough so Cal would have to contradict him.

“I am going to go home and fill out forms until my hands forget they have bones,” Cal said. “And then I am going to sleep like a person who tried.”

At home they ate peanut butter on saltines with the reverence that sometimes attaches to unremarkable food at unremarkable hours. The house felt looser, as though the walls had learned how not to eavesdrop. His phone lit the counter a soft blue. June again. A screenshot. The clip of his hands on the drums had been captured and captioned by a stranger: Chief has chops; who knew. June’s text under it said: I did. He put the phone down because he did not want to cry in his own kitchen over text like a teenager, and then he did anyway, just a ridiculous two tears, one for each eye, symmetrical like he was showing off.

Thursday Julyed itself into the middle of the week even though it was months away. He handled a budget argument like a drummer handles a bad room—move a little, find the sweet spot, try not to hit the cymbal that makes the ugly sound more than you have to. The letter from the ethics commission found a home in Peña’s outbox with a response that would sit in their stomach like a carb. The Mayor walked through the bullpen and said, “I saw a video,” in that tone that could cut either way. “Your snare is tuned a hair tight,” she added, and kept walking. He did not know whether to be charmed or afraid.

He practiced that night without it being practice. He stirred onions in a pan and kept time with the wooden spoon. He turned on the tap and listened to the way it drummed the sink in a triplet, adjusted the handle so it didn’t. He turned the engine of his truck and counted the delay before it caught and decided the battery would need attention before the cold came in honest. He sat at the kit only after he had finished being a person for the day. He set the metronome on his phone to a tempo that felt like a walk you could have a conversation over. He tried the ghost notes he had seen. They sounded like nothing until suddenly they made the something sound like more of itself. He kept going until his right shoulder objected, not with pain but with the kind of fatigue that says, you are not twenty and you do not need to prove you are.

The neighbor who had complained knocked at eight forty-five. He went to the door ready to say his hour lines and found her holding a loaf pan with a dish towel over it like a magic trick about to be performed. “Banana bread,” she said. “If you play that thing after nine to eleven on weeknights I will file paperwork that will make your head ache for a month. Before that, I can tolerate it like I tolerate my husband’s woodworking videos, which is to say not with joy but with a certain resigned civility.”

“That’s the best bargain I’ve been offered this week,” he said. He took the bread. It was still warm, this ridiculous human thing.

She peered around him. The drum kit sat with its ridiculous dignity in the lamplight, all circles and sticks. “Why not guitar like a normal man,” she said, not unkindly.

“I wanted something I had to sit down to do,” he said, which was not an answer but it was true.

Friday threw weather and paperwork and a call from a reporter who wanted to ask why the department didn’t have officers on bicycles like Portland. He answered with the patience of a geography teacher. The day had a jam in it—two hours where nothing would move. He got up from his desk and walked it away. He ran into Rizzo, who had that look on his face that means a child has said something startling and we are trying to decide whether to laugh or call a priest. “My kid asked if you were going to be in a parade,” Rizzo said. “Like on the back of a truck, drumming, with a sash.”

“Only if the sash says Felonious Noise,” Cal said. “We can throw drumsticks instead of candy. Lawsuits as confetti.”

He drove to the old roller rink parking lot because the brain likes to close circles even when your calendar does not have time. There was no swap meeting today, only a wind that had been laundered and the tall weeds doing their slow dance at the edges. He parked where he’d parked and stepped out and felt the sensation of standing on the spot where a decision happened, which is a different kind of sacred even if no one else would light a candle there. He wasn’t hoping for the old man with the white beard to manifest like a story giving itself a sequel. He looked anyway because hope is rude like that.

He was leaving when a truck eased in, paint the kind of red you can never match again. The man who got out had the beard. It had collected more sawdust. He smiled without surprise as if they had agreed to meet here and simply both forgotten. “You playing,” he asked.

“Some,” Cal said. The word had humility hanging off it like a tin can tied to a bumper.

“I heard,” the man said. “The town tells on you faster than a little sister. You need a muffler pad?” He held one up—a square of black the texture of a closed mouth.

“I need about seven years,” Cal said. “And maybe a different head.”

“You got that look,” the old man said, half admiring, half worried. “The one where a man has admitted to himself he wants something and is pretending he hasn’t. Dangerous look. It gets you into church or into trouble.”

Cal bought the pad to appease both the neighbor and himself. He put it under his arm like a book he promised to read. He drove back with the window down and the radio off. Norman lay around him like a score he had spent his whole life misreading, only now he could see where the rests went and why you put them there. He thought, unbidden, of June at the library table under the light that makes books look wise. He decided to ask her to the museum on Sunday, to stand in front of the metronomes and let their ticks fall on them like a gentle hail and to be the kind of father who puts his kids in rooms where time is a proposition instead of a threat.

Friday night he practiced without the drums again. He made his steps in the kitchen on two and four. He spoke to the cat that had adopted Milo for the week on the one. He slept, and in the dream the metronome was smaller, the building its size had been replaced by a telephone pole with a woodpecker who had the good sense to land only when the breeze stilled. He woke in the half light Saturday and the sound inside him had settled into something like habit. He had bought himself a minute between years and put something in it, and it held. He was not finished deserving it. He would have to keep deserving it every time his foot found the one. He made coffee that was better than serviceable and then, because he could, because no one had told him he could not, he texted June too early for nineteen and wrote: museum with me tomorrow? She sent back a thumbs-up and then, a minute later, a second text: play loud. He laughed, then looked at the clock and realized he was exactly on time.Chapter 5

Sunday made a show of itself in the way Oklahoma Sundays do—quiet at the edges and busy in the middle, like a polite person with too many secrets. Cal picked June up outside her dorm because he had insisted, and she allowed it because a free ride is a free ride even for the righteous. She came down with her hair caught up in one of those careless ways that take three products and youth to accomplish. She slid into the passenger seat and put her backpack between her knees like it might bite. He wanted to say something smart about art or time or how glad he was she said yes. He pointed at the windshield instead and said, “Wipers are getting old,” and she said, “Everything is,” and they both laughed at their own laziness and the smallness of the joke.

The museum was the same building pretending to be new again; the batteries in its calm had been swapped out overnight. The parking lot had the same constellation of reliable cars and a single astonishing machine that looked like it had eaten two salaries. Inside, the metronomes ticked their minor storm, less intimidating at noon than they had been under the glamour of opening night. The student in the black dress had been replaced by a young man with hair that looked like it had been combed with his fingers, which it probably had. He checked their angles like a shepherd. June drifted to them without instruction, the way some people lean toward what’s counting without even knowing it.

“They’re not actually the same tempo,” she said, head cocked, doing math in the air. “If they were, they’d eventually sync. But this—this is like lissajous curves you hear. It’s interference. Constructive, destructive. We did this in physics. Or we would have if Dr. Patel had liked fun.”

“You just said something I’m going to pretend I understood,” he said. He took some pleasure in how the sounds tripped across her words, the way her brain could carry two rhythms at once and not panic. He pointed at the smallest metronome, which had developed a sullen lean. “That one is me,” he said. “Stubborn and needing a little push.”

She reached out as the student had and flicked it without staring down the docent, a risk assessment she had learned on other field trips. It began again like a runner after tying a shoe. She turned to him. “Did you know that in orchestra they make the drummers sit in the back because the heartbeat is dangerous if it’s too close?”

“I believe it. Drummers move furniture without lifting it.” He wanted to tell her about the jam night but he didn’t want to put it on her like a trophy she had to pretend to like. He wanted nothing from her but the use of her time. “Tell me your week,” he said, which is the sentence parents say when they want their kids to locate themselves on the map.

She told him pieces, as you do in an echoey room. A professor who had a crush on his own voice. A roommate who collected ceramic frogs like someone had told her they were going to go extinct and she was responsible. The calculus assignment with an answer that seemed to change when you looked at it with different light. She waved it off and he didn’t chase it. The docents had been taught a new phrase for the rehung gallery and used it like an anointing: site-responsive. Cal nodded at things that were squares on the wall pretending they were more than squares, at photographs of sky that were sky and then not, at a sculpture of bent wood that made him rethink the cheap chair at his desk and its weary dignity. He had never learned to appreciate art in the way people say they do, by naming schools and eras, but he had learned to recognize when someone had paid attention hard enough to make it transferable.

They stood in front of a painting where a man had laid a grid over a field and then let the paint disobey the grid, gently. It looked like a joke on order and also a love letter to it. “This is you,” June said finally, and when he cocked his head she shrugged. “This is you making a plan and then life not sticking to it and you pretending you planned that too.”

“Flattering,” he said, and meant it, because she had seen the part where he could improvise and had sometimes had to. They moved to the room where the local photographers had hung the town as if it were a person they loved in a complicated way. Someone had taken a long exposure of the highway curve south of I-35, red and white lines unwinding like yarn. “That’s a measure,” she said, and he looked at it until it became one.

He bought her a lemonade in the museum café with their weirdly earnest sandwiches. They sat with their cups of ice and a cookie that had been optimistic when it cooled. She drew the heel of her sneaker along the underside of the bench in a way that made the bench consider complaining. “I saw the video,” she said, casual, as if she were reporting a sighting of something expected.

“I saw that you saw it,” he said. “I saw your I did.”

She kept her eyes on the condensation ring her lemonade was leaving, as if it were a problem set she might be able to finish if she paced herself. “You looked like you were breathing,” she said. “Which is not the same as being at work. It was nice. You get eyes when you’re on a podium.” She paused. “They’re very shiny. Like you’re trying to be lacquered. Those weren’t in the video.”

“I’m considering having them surgically dulled,” he said. He reached over and pushed one of the napkins toward her because people like to have something to put between themselves and the wood of a table when they’re saying an important thing. “I’m trying not to ruin it,” he said in a voice that tasted like he was telling the weather his name. “Trying to keep it mine and not the town’s, for a minute.”

“Then don’t,” she said with nineteen’s clean certainty. “Play when you want. And don’t invite people who make you talk about it like you’re running for office. Invite Milo and the cat and… me when I can. Don’t turn it into a charity for their boredom.”

He felt a tiny ache in his sternum he recognized as relief. “Do I get to come to one of your things and stand at the back like a respectful ghost,” he said.

“If I ever have a thing where not knowing who is behind me is a comfort, yes,” she said. “Finals, maybe. You can stand behind the proctor and make them nervous.”

They walked through the gift shop without buying anything on principle. He looked at a small metronome the size of a two-bite brownie and made a face at the price. June tempted him with a pair of socks printed with clocks. He pretended to consider. He bought her a postcard of the tornado photograph and handed it to her like a promise. “Put it where it can look at your laundry pile,” he said. “A reminder to rotate.”

Outside the sky had that washed-out compliance of afternoons that want to be naps. He drove her back slow, stitched into traffic with the other people who had built Sunday around themselves like a fort. She let the postcard bend in her hands, flipping it, then flipping it back. “Come to the gig Friday,” he said at the light, doing the bravery while staring ahead. “You can leave whenever. You can not come. Both are legal.”

“I might,” she said, which in June’s mouth was a half-yes and honestly better than a full one from other people. “Text me if you’re going to do the thing where you go onstage so I can pretend to be surprised while already having filmed it.”

Monday was waiting when he got to the station with its stack of things nobody had volunteered to hold. The ethics commission had sent an email thank you in answer to Peña’s imaginative ten dollars and its cousins; she brought it in like a cat carries a mouse. “We are temporarily uninteresting to them,” she said. “If we can keep it boring for ninety days, they will forget our names and commit their energy to someone else who will break a more interesting rule.”

“That’s my management style,” he said. “Uninteresting enough to keep your job. Interesting enough to keep yourself.”

Harmon had discovered a cache of practice pads on a clearance site and sent a link with ten exclamation marks as if it were a bomb. Cal ordered three because the number felt like he was doing something without having to sign a purchase order for a full set of timpani. When they came, disks of gray rubber on wood, he set one in the bullpen near the coffee pot like a pet you’re not sure the landlord will notice. Officers put their cups down on it until someone flicked its surface with a pen and discovered the way it gave back. By Friday noon, there was a pencil next to it on purpose, and the building had acquired a sound like a heart that had remembered how to laugh at itself.

On Tuesday he rode with Brinkley for an hour, the way he did sometimes to remind himself he still liked the roads. They trawled the neighborhoods where every third house had a trampoline tilted at an angle like a question. A call came in about a kid making a ruckus; the air in Dispatch had the resigned tone of a report filed by a very tired neighbor. They pulled up in front of a home with a Ranger flag and a bicycle on its side like a calamity. In the backyard a boy of eight had assembled a drum set from two five-gallon buckets, a wheelbarrow, and the metal lid of a grill his father had given up on three summers ago. He was working a pattern with the focus of a surgeon. The neighbor peered through a fence slat with wicked dedication.

“Sir,” Brinkley said, and Cal held a hand up like a conductor asking for the oboes to wait. He listened. The boy was on the one without knowing that was what it was called. The left hand was talking to the right in a language the grown world was going to try to translate and probably fail. Cal walked to the fence gate instead of unlatching it. The father appeared with that walk men have when they’re calculating whether they should apologize or get mad. It was maybe three in the afternoon, which is the hour you can still be a child in a yard without owing anybody anything.

“We can ask him to keep it down after five,” Cal said, making a vowel of his voice. “Right now I’m tempted to ask him for lessons.”

The man’s face reassembled into a person. “He’s got a cousin in a band,” he said. “It’s been a week since we gave him the buckets. He hasn’t asked for his Nintendo once and I don’t know whether to praise Jesus or hide.”

“Praising Jesus and hiding are not mutually exclusive,” Cal said. He turned to the fence. “Buddy,” he called gently, and the boy paused as if he had come to the end of a long sentence and was willing to consider punctuation. “You’re good. At four thirty we’re going to put a towel on the bucket for the neighbor. At four fifty-five we’re going to take the towel off. That way everyone gets to be a citizen.”

The boy nodded with an adult’s gravity he had stolen from one of the adults in his life. He started again, careful, then not careful, which is how it goes. The neighbor vanished from the slat like a prairie dog who’d been written up for loitering. Brinkley wrote a note he had no one to give, which is a skill you develop in this line. Cal left the sound behind with a reluctance he disguised by being professional when he got back in the car.

He put the muffler pad on his snare that night and listened to the difference it made—the thump turning into a bump that was easier on the walls. The neighbor’s husband waved from the driveway two houses down as if to say the treaty had been renewed for another ninety days. Milo’s cat, who had refused to admit it had been Milo’s before it moved in and who had deigned to become a regular presence on the back of the couch, watched the proceedings with that morbid curiosity usually assigned to journalists. Milo himself came in with the day on his shoulders the way people wear backpacks they forgot to take off. He put the straps down with a sigh you hear from men who have made a life out of low wages and high lyrics.

“Friday lineup is solid,” Milo said. “They put us second so people will still be awake. I told Reese the drummer I’m bringing my own percussionist who is willing to work for crackers.”

“I prefer saltines to ritz,” Cal said, testing a buzz roll that sounded like someone rubbing sandpaper on a remembered apology. “And I bill in banana bread.”

Milo nodded toward the pad on the coffee table like it was a museum piece. “The house kit at Red Lion is sulky and rude,” he said. “You’ll have to sweet-talk it. The hi-hat squeaks like it’s telling on you to God. The snare smirks. The floor tom believes in nothing.”

“I get along with skeptics,” Cal said. He tried the ghosted notes he had seen at jam night and felt the way they made the main hits look better, like unflattering friends bring out the charm in you. “I am nervous in the way that suggests I should be grateful my life gives me good reasons to be nervous.”

“Dangerous,” Milo said. “You’re going to get addicted to it and then you will make unwise choices like quitting and going to Tulsa to play for twenty dollars a night and a plate of spaghetti. Do not come to Tulsa. Tulsa is already full.”

Wednesday night the rain returned with theatrical timing and then realized it was an understudy and retreated. Cal took a call that required him to stand in a living room that had been marinated in cigarettes since 1987 and talk to a mother about a boy who had been caught at the skatepark with a bag of something in the family of harmless; harmless which is not the same as legal. He kept his voice on two and four and let the boy look everywhere but at him and let the boy’s mother focus all her horsepower on the carpet. He wrote the citation like a man writing his own name over and over to make sure he remembered it. Outside, on the porch, the boy’s hands did that adolescent flex of not yet knowing where to be. “You play,” Cal said, a stupid question and therefore the right one.

“Guitar,” the boy said, like it was an indictment.

“Practice,” Cal said. “It’ll make you very poor and very hard to kill.” The boy laughed despite himself and the rain attempted again and failed again to commit to its bit.

Friday came with the particular adrenaline of small-town nights where five kinds of normal decide to leave the house at once. Cal spent the first half of it in a meeting about winter staffing where nobody wanted to say out loud that three people had put in for medical leave and two for early retirement because once you said it, it became more true. He let Peña run the numbers because watching her drive a calculator was like watching someone parallel park a ship. He left at eight with a bag under his arm that held nothing but sticks and the instruction not to be an idiot.

The Red Lion had shaved nothing since Wednesday. The stage light was still the color of a bruise. The bartender gave him a nod he might have withheld a week ago. The crowd had organized itself into zones: men with memories at the bar; women in jackets assessing the jackets; a cluster of students with their phones cocked like they were birds with long necks ready to strike. Brinkley had brought a poet because he couldn’t help himself; the poet looked the room over as if it were a form he had to fill out with unusual honesty. Deke arrived last and took up a posture he thought went unnoticed—loudly casual, deeply attentive.

Reese the drummer put out his cigarette and held his sticks like he was preparing to cross-examine them. He and Cal shook hands like people at a family reunion who aren’t sure if they’re on the same side. “You want it tight?” Reese asked, which was really a question about philosophy.

“Not marching band,” Cal said. “Not soup. Somewhere between ‘I can hear you think’ and ‘I can’t hear my beer.’”

“Okay, cop,” Reese said without malice, and went around the kit, loosening a thing here, tightening a thing there, like a chiropractor who had a grudge. Milo tuned his guitar with that old tender face he had when he tuned anything. He looked down at a set list that had acquired hieroglyphs over the years. “We’ll do the waltz,” he said, almost under his breath, because the name of the song now had a job.

Cal sat in for the second number, not the first, because men like him prefer to sneak into the pool mid-conversation. The house kit greeted his backside with familiarity that wasn’t intimacy. The hi-hat did squeak. He aimed his foot at it like you aim at a dog who refuses to come in from the yard—firm, kind, employing guilt. The room made its own weather and they entered it. Milo gave him the eye that meant, “don’t be impressive; be in time,” and he tried to be the smaller version of the thing he’d liked being Wednesday. He placed the one like you set a lamp down where you want it. He let the ghost notes nudge the room into animating itself. He made the fill he’d decided he’d earned, nothing more, one syllable in the right place.

Halfway through a man at the bar said something low and dumb to a woman who had moved one stool away twice already. Cal watched the way her face shifted from polite to a geometry where every angle was tired. He felt his back ask him to stand up with his badge on and tell the man to find a hole and get in it. He kept his sticks on his own work. He watched the bartender do hers instead—she made a motion with two fingers that summoned a bouncer with a body that had memorized how to be large without being unkind. The man left with a shrug and a tree ring of apologies that made no sound because he had never learned how to send them outward. The song did not falter. The beat ran a protective circle around it. Cal felt, with a relief that startled him, that there were other adults here and he did not have to be all of them.

They played three. On the third, a song Milo had been smuggling around since Amarillo, Cal got ahead of himself and then deliberately took half a step back and the rest of him followed. Reese heard it and tossed him a little push with his left hand the way you shoulder your friend through a door. The room, which knows more than it should about forgiveness, forgave. When they got off the stage Reese said, “You count honest,” an insult in some circles, a benediction in others. Cal took it like good bread. He didn’t want to stay for the part of the night when nostalgia turns mean. He pointed at his watch in the air where Milo could see it. Milo nodded like men nod when they have had practice being brothers without sharing a roof.

Outside the air had cooled while nobody was looking. June was there on the curb, legs crossed like a bookend, a hoodie zipped halfway because that is the distance that makes you look like you aren’t trying. She had the look of someone pretending to be casual about their own father. “I liked the one with the line about laundromats,” she said by way of hello. “It made me want to buy a roll of quarters and call someone I don’t like to tell them I’m fine.”

“That is the reaction we were going for,” he said, and she rolled her eyes like a girl who refuses to let you be clever too often and in the same way. He put his hand on her shoulder a second longer than necessary and then took it back as if he’d borrowed the weight and it was due back at the library.

They got tacos once the grease had been declared legal by the night. They ate them in the parking lot of a pharmacy because the parking lot had a light that lied and said it was the day. “Are you going to put a drum in the station like a plant,” June said. “Like morale. ‘Please water and/or practice daily.’”

“I put a practice pad near the coffee,” he said. “It already has a social life. Peña is pretending to despise it. Deke is pretending he invented it. Rizzo has tapped out one hundred and forty-seven versions of ‘We Will Rock You’ and is currently at war with himself over whether to attempt ‘Rosanna.’”

She took a bite that would have been messy if she hadn’t learned from a very young age how to handle street food like a gentleman. “You’re building a cult,” she said. “Call it percussion, sell it to HR, get wellness dollars. Don’t tell them about the part where sometimes joy is a side effect.”

Saturday tried to go sideways and then remembered itself. He drove out to Brown Hill for the community meeting he had been putting between himself and sleep since the first briefing. He stood in a gym under fluorescent lights that had memories of dodgeball and told people what he could tell them about the incident, which was too much and not enough. Someone asked him to promise and he did not. Someone demanded and he did not. Someone cried and he nodded in that way that says I am storing this somewhere useful even if you never see the day it comes back out. He kept his speech on the beat. The applause at the end was the loudest polite kind, which is better than the small sincere kind that sometimes rises after a disaster and feels like a trick. On the way out, Councilor Ruggles shook his hand and looked at the drum kit parts he could see on Cal’s person even when they were not there. “You’re trending,” Ruggles said, and Cal had learned enough from his daughter to say, “God help us,” and no more.

The neighbor brought the loaf pan back with a note inside that said, “Heard you through the wall. Not mad. Consider curtains.” He laughed at the economy of it and then went online and bought the curtains she wanted him to consider because sometimes civic harmony is a charge on your credit card. He practiced with the window closed and the light on and the pad under the snare and the idea in his head growing into something that would survive winter.

On Sunday he did something that would have embarrassed him a year ago. He texted the training sergeant and asked if he could borrow fifteen minutes of the Monday block to talk about breathing and timing and attention. “You’ll make them do yoga,” the sergeant replied like an accusation. “We’ll lose twenty percent to the fire department.”

“No yoga,” he said. “Counting. The thing we already do when we keep from becoming animals.”

Monday morning the recruits stood in their laudable postures and allowed him to be ridiculous. He put a metronome app on the projector and made the room tick. He asked them, one by one, to walk across the room and say their names on the two and the four. They could not at first and then they could and then they laughed because what else do you do when something simple takes all of your attention. He told them about Tactical Breathing without naming it as such because if he labeled it they would flinch. He let them count in their heads to four and threw them questions about what coffee they drank and what street they’d grown up on and what they were afraid of. Some of them answered in rhythm without realizing it. Some of them put their fear on the one and looked surprised when it didn’t fall apart.

Peña watched from the back with a disposition that said she was filing it under Possibly Useful, Possibly Dumb. After, when the recruits had clattered themselves down the hall, she stepped into the aisle and stood where he could see her but the city could not. “That was either the silliest or the smartest thing I’ve seen a chief do,” she said. “You made them breathe on purpose. That could keep someone alive on an August afternoon.” She looked for a beat like she was going to say something else and then did not. He took the gift as if it were heavy.

A letter came in from somebody’s grandmother written on paper that belonged to a different century, cursive like climbing vines. It said, in essence, that noise is part of living and would he please consider joining the community band on Sundays after church because they need a drummer who can count and take direction and is not afraid of the sousaphone player who has been there since statehood. He laughed until he had to put the letter down because laughter has its own limits. He put it on the corkboard above his desk with the other artifacts that keep men from turning into their jobs entirely. He looked at the corner of orange from the antique swap flyer still pinned there, its cheap ink fading with dignity.

At home that night Milo had opened his laptop and his mouth like a person who had made a promise to himself and was going to break it gently. “I got an offer,” he said, eyes not on Cal, which is how you tell the truth without making it a duel. “Two weeks. Amarillo to Santa Fe to Albuquerque to a place that might be an Indian casino or an elaborate furniture store. Don’t ask me which. I take it, I leave Thursday. I don’t, I sit on your couch and pretend I’m not bored and eat your pickles and leave next month resenting you for letting me stay.”

Cal felt an old muscle wake up, the one that says you should hold people down for their own good. He let it sit and shake itself and then go back to sleep. “Go,” he said. “Bring me back the thing people bring back from Santa Fe that isn’t a poncho. Come back when the couch has missed you enough to make it seem like you’re doing it a favor by sitting on it.”

Milo looked up then, a relief that was not small passing over his face. “You can keep my practice pad,” he said. “Treat it like a plant.”

“Water daily,” Cal said. He looked at the kit in the corner the way you look at a dog that has finally started to believe it lives here. He hit the hi-hat with the tip of his stick, a closemouthed kiss. The town breathed through the vents. The building’s big metronome—the one that swung over all of them whether they wanted it or not—kept its story. He had a minute between years. He had put something in it. It was not a miracle. It was not a tragedy. It was a noise that did not hurt. He counted it off again, quietly, as if the house itself were listening for whether he could keep a promise no one had made him make.Chapter 6 began with the kind of goodbye that pretends it’s paperwork. Milo’s offer became a departure date written in dry-erase marker on the side of a cardboard box, and then, by the alchemy of logistics, a suitcase yawning on the couch like a mouth resisting the dentist. They didn’t make a ceremony of it because ceremonies turn simple leaving into a mausoleum with napkins. Cal drove him to the edge of town in the blue truck with the radio off on purpose, both of them contributing weather and small advice—the state of the radiator, the map of a back road between Amarillo and Tucumcari, the fact that the peanut brittle at a particular gas station is actually good if you don’t make a personality out of it. At the exit for the highway Milo said, “Don’t let the town make a balloon animal out of you,” and Cal said, “Don’t let the road pretend to be a personality test,” and they hugged with the efficient love of men who don’t need to prove they know what the hug is for. Milo’s taillights became two punctuation marks at the end of a sentence the wind edited with dust; then they were gone, and the cab of the truck had the acoustic of an empty room you suddenly respect. Cal went home and discovered that a house will add five degrees of silence when you remove one person who laughs at the right time.

The first hour alone he tried not to touch the kit the way you try not to touch a scab because touching it makes it the center of your day. He did the dishes and came up with three better ways to do the dishes he had not tried in twenty years. He set the muffler pad just so and then moved it half an inch because faith is, at its root, about alignment. He put on a metronome he’d found that was less a click and more a breath, a soft thup that sounded like a person nodding from the next room. He didn’t practice fills because fills turn into peacocking; he practiced staying, which is the drum’s real sermon if you’re not lying to yourself. The neighbor’s new curtains were cheerful in a way he had not earned, and they ate some of the higher frequencies he didn’t love about the snare; he sent a silent thank you in the direction of banana bread and bureaucracy. When he finally let the sticks touch down, the sound felt like a letter to himself with no return address, and for a minute he resisted the reflex to read it aloud to somebody else.

At the station the week had the quality of a floor that needed buffing and would not get it. The Brown Hill follow-up nibbled at him from three different angles—the DA’s friendly menace about timelines, the Mayor’s precise notes on language like a violinist correcting bow hold, and the reality that no amount of words could make a family’s house feel properly shaped again. In the middle of that, the little practice pad by the coffee pot had evolved into what anthropologists would have called a ritual site, were there grant money in it. Officers passed, tapped, rolled an anxious paradiddle while waiting for the Keurig to commit; the administrative assistant from Records, who had marched ten years ago in a band she refused to name because the uniform had included a cape, executed a crisp flam that made three men look up as if someone had said their names in a chapel. Peña pretended to hate the pad, then pretended less, then admitted she could play a clean three over four and did, without smiling, as if the polyrhythm were a sandwich eaten alone in a parked car. Cal tossed one of the pads into an empty briefing room and found it occupied later by a sergeant who had always barked instead of spoke; the man was making a mess of a swing pattern and grinning like he had been handed a different interior.

By midweek Councilor Ruggles had done the thing councilors do when they are bored by their own importance; he scheduled a subcommittee meeting with a title that could lull a toddler—Public Asset Usage Clarification Session. The email came with bullet points sharp enough to pick your teeth with. Cal wore the tie that was not black or navy and sat in a room where the climate control was set to keep dairy. Ruggles did the smile that feels like a small dog being nice to your ankle and asked, for the record, about ten-dollar forms and muffler pads and whether the chief’s drums were personal property or belonging now to the tax-integrated spirit of the municipality. Cal answered cleanly because clean answers are a kindness to all involved, and then he let himself say a thing that wasn’t on the index card in his pocket. He said that you don’t ask men and women to soak up the town’s fear and heat and then act surprised when they wring it out somewhere, and that it had been either drums or a hobby with more antique firearms and late nights attached to it. The stenographer’s face did a small thing like a person trying not to nod, and Ruggles made a note that might have been a joke for his wife later. The motion ended up tabled, which is Oklahoma for we’re tired of this and want a sandwich, and Peña, who had accompanied him with a poker face she had cultivated in graduate school and county courtrooms, bought him a coffee afterward without comment and handed him a napkin like a medal.

Thursday delivered a weather advisory that slapped the whole county like a rude cousin. The sky darkened with a theater kid’s commitment, and somewhere west a siren practice became not-practice. Radios came alive in a way that made the hair on Cal’s arms vote for more training. He moved through the building talking quieter the louder the room got, touched three shoulders on purpose, peered into Dispatch to watch the new kid ride the board like a skittish horse and then catch it, which is a pleasure to witness you can’t put in a report. When the wall of rain arrived, it did it like a drummer dropping the one on purpose, a communal flinch and then a relief that the thing had been named. They put the neighborhood at the end of Frost and Ayers on a slow roll, and Cal was not above superstition—he found himself tapping the side of the radio with an idle two and four as if to say to the storm, we will keep time if you will not behave like an artist. A transformer complained on Berry; a tree made a politics of a power line; the usual rooster tail of small emergencies fanned out. He hated that nights like this charged him with the godlike and the ridiculous; he loved, in a way that made him wary, the rare, righteous choreography of a team that knew itself.

He went home past midnight to a house that had briefly reconsidered its allegiance to electricity and then rejoined the grid with a sigh like a recently reconciled couple. The kit sat in the corner with the patient expression of something that will wait as long as it takes. He touched the hi-hat with his shoe as if greeting a dog that had learned not to jump. He played three minutes to tell his hands he was still in there, then stopped before his neighbor could exercise her treaty rights. He slept the deep, black sleep of men who have spent their day inventing calm, and dreamed of the practice pad thudding in rooms he was not in—coffee room, briefing room, copy room—each one setting a little steady in the places paper usually takes over.

Sunday after church time—not his church, not a church he had ever belonged to but a low, brick building that had discovered the county’s appetite for multipurpose—he took the grandmother’s letter from the corkboard and said yes to the community band. He carried his sticks in the inside pocket of his jacket like contraband and walked into a gym that had been temporarily convinced it was an auditorium by the addition of a hundred folding chairs and a podium that had seen everything. The conductor wore the certainty of retired authority like a scarf; she had the hair of someone who had led children in twelve Christmas concerts without losing her soul. The sousaphone player had the gunslinger’s squint of an old boy who had survived wheat harvests and divorces by doing everything slower than his enemies. People looked up as he entered the way small towns look when a man who signs certain papers sits down among them in his civilian clothes, curiosity trimmed with manners. He took the back row, as tradition demanded of drummers, and found a kit that was the age of his first marriage—chrome flaking, cymbals telling long stories, throne stubborn in the up position.

Reading music was like remembering a language he had quit in sophomore year out of spite. The page said “Lightly” in a font that looked like it had been written by a nice aunt. It said “mp” and “mf” and “don’t be an idiot” in a grammar he made himself respect. The conductor tapped her baton, which was a pencil, because budgets and charm are always roommates. “We will begin with our national debt to Sousa,” she said, dry as pie crust. “Please play with joy. Please count like you can.” Cal lowered his eyes as if to say, I will not show off in this church, and then he began the simple, martial thing with his left hand finding grace notes the chart had not authorized. There is an art to keeping marches from turning into arguments; he discovered his foot felt more patriotic than his hands and he had to coax it into a middle school civics class. The first trumpet came in early because trumpets are born that way and the clarinets frowned with a power that deserved its own parking permit. By the end of the first run the room smelled like sheet music and perseverance.

The break was a bake sale without the sale. A table materialized with lemon bars and a coffee that had aged in a urn. An older woman in a sweater with a cat that had been embroidered with love and insufficient thread came up to Cal and said, “My sister says you’re the drum chief,” and when he tried to untie that she patted his shoulder and handed him a napkin as though napkins could save us. The sousaphone player addressed him with the particular bonhomie men reserve for other men they suspect might be compromised by dignity. “You do the left foot,” he said, as if telling him a family secret. “Don’t let them rush you after the break. These clarinet girls get together and talk about tempo like it’s a boyfriend.” The conductor clapped with the peculiar crispness that can hush a committee. “Back,” she said, “from our sugar choices,” and they sat.

If jam night had been a fast river with glossy stones, community band was a gravel road you take because there is no better way to the lake. The second piece was something sentimental and American, flags in the chords and a yearning that, on the right day, could be forgiven. Cal had to count rests for thirty-two bars and discovered in the counting a meditation he had not anticipated. He felt his elbows ask to make a meal out of the quiet, his shoulders remind him that sometimes being glue means resisting the itch to flex. When the mallets came out for the glockenspiel he tried not to sigh with longing and then remembered he was fifty-two and allowed to have absurd preferences. At one point the conductor stopped the piece not because of pitch or posture but because the whole enterprise had, she explained, begun to feel like a sermon delivered by a man who had not read the text. “Smile,” she said to all of them, “with your wrists. It will keep you from going to hell.”

He left the rehearsal with a half-eaten lemon bar he hadn’t wanted and a sense that the back of his brain had been combed. Outside, under the low clouds that never make a decision, a boy with a trumpet case big enough to count as luggage stared at Cal’s sticks peeking from his jacket. “My teacher says if I learn paradiddles my math will get better,” the boy declared. “I hate both.” Cal told him the truth, which is that sometimes you have to continue hating something while you learn it and that the hate is not a reliable metric. The boy shrugged with the disdain of ten and then stared at the rain like it owed him six dollars. Cal drove away feeling a clearer distinction between the kind of rhythm that makes you feel big and the kind that makes you feel held.

At home he discovered the muffler pad had stuck itself to the snare head in a small romance; he peeled it off as gently as a bandage on a child you only half know. The neighbor’s husband waved from his driveway in a gesture that had settled into something like friendship. The cat, which had decided in Milo’s absence to become politically active, demanded salmon with a look that said without saying, I remember who fed me. He practiced for twenty minutes, then twenty-two as penance for wanting twenty, and in the spaces between hits he heard the house breathing like it had been instructed by a meditation app to be its best self.

Tuesday produced a call he did not want to take and took anyway, to a woman whose son had not been home in two nights, which is the exact number of nights a mother uses to cook her heart into something edible. He sat in her kitchen and let the clock be ridiculous while he asked his meticulously soft questions. He watched her hands manage napkin after napkin like lawyers pretending to be birds. He counted for himself in quarters, because in that counting a man can lower his temperature enough to keep from breaking. When he got back to the station he went to the practice pad for thirty seconds and executed a sloppy press roll; Harmon, passing, said, “You look like a man making gravy,” and Cal said, “I am,” and Harmon said, “Make enough for the table,” and kept walking with the cheer of a person who has given away the only advice he could afford.

That night June sent him a link to a lecture that wasn’t a lecture, a video with a scientist in a sweater explaining beats and interference with two tiny metronomes on a board and a trick that made them line up like obedient children if the board could move under them. Underneath she wrote: told you, and he wrote back: you were right, and she wrote back: say it again, and he wrote it again because fathers are not above humiliation when it buys them a laugh. He set two metronome apps on two phones on a cutting board because he was not above cliche and watched them drift apart and back while he boiled pasta and thought about how the job is sometimes just that—letting the surface under the chaos be flexible enough to bring the chaos into accord. He ate standing up because sitting down felt like surrender.

The second jam night he went without Milo, which is how you tell whether you want a thing because it was a person or because it was itself. The Red Lion had not developed an affection for him; bars don’t love you, they loan you a room. Reese nodded like a doorman. A young drummer had the kit and the air of a young drummer—stick twirls as punctuation, fills like apologies he didn’t owe. Cal stood by the lamp that made everyone look briefly cinematic and waited until Reese looked over and did the two-fingers, you-in? Cal took the seat for one song that was more complicated than he’d have chosen; he kept his head on the two and four like someone told him there was a reward there. He made fewer mistakes because he was trying less hard to be right and more hard to be useful. After, the bartender put a water down with a little ceremony as if he’d graduated into a program that had no certificate. “You’re better,” she said, mercilessly observational. “You were dulled last week by your brother’s eyes. You’re shiny dull now. It works with the room.”

There were still calls that week: a kid with a sprained wrist who refused to admit he’d been trying to skateboard off his roof; a man who had decided to build a bonfire out of his taxes; a shoplifter who needed to be told with all the grace the language allowed that she was not the first person to think you could put three steaks under a winter coat and walk out into the sun unscrutinized. Cal did the thing he’d taught the recruits—he let his sentences land on twos and fours even when he was selling a no. Once, in the middle of a mess in a cul-de-sac where three cars had kissed without consent, he found himself counting aloud under his breath while everyone barked their versions of the truth, and a woman with the good sense of forty said, “Are you saying grace,” and he said, “Kind of,” and they all laughed at exactly the same time, which is rare.

The Mayor, who had the appetite of a hawk for opportunities to fold chaos into messaging, pulled him into a breakfast where the eggs had been whipped into compliance and said they were launching a Community Calm initiative because alliteration sells easier than nuance. “We will not call it drums,” she said, jabbing a blueberry with a fork in a way that would have disturbed the blueberry had it been alive. “We will call it rhythm. Rhythm reads like virtue and does not scare the donors. You, Chief, will lead a workshop for neighborhood associations on counting without losing your dignity.” He said he would because sometimes policy is a theater you can use for good. He went back to the station and wrote on a legal pad in block letters the things he knew: count out loud; your lungs are smarter than your fear; most rooms will agree to one if you make it worth their while.

On Saturday afternoon the community band played at a retirement community that had named itself Laurel Meadows with an optimism that made the elderly residents laugh into their hands. Cal wore a white shirt with sleeves rolled because it felt honest. The conductor made a speech to a hundred people whose life’s metronomes had been wound many times and not broken. They played the sentimental one and the march and a medley of television themes that condensed three decades of America into a politely nostalgic hash. During “Moon River,” a man in a wheelchair cried in a way that did not ask to be noticed, and the woodwinds became physicians for a measure. After, a woman in an oxygen cannula told Cal he kept time like her Frank and then blinked hard at her own foolishness and patted the back of his hand as if to erase the small embarrassment. On the way out, he stood in the lobby under a plastic ficus and answered a question about the noise ordinance with the same attention he gave to tempos; the two were cousins whether anyone admitted it.

He installed the curtains the neighbor had suggested, which should have been a thirty-minute task and became, by the logic of small domestic battles, a three-hour saga, and when he was done he stood back and laughed because the street had become a little softer around the edges and he had spent twenty dollars to buy goodwill he could never have legislated. That evening he prepared for the neighborhood workshop by typing the word Beat three times and deleting it because he refused to be that person. He assembled a playlist made of breaths, soft clicks, a train passing, a washing machine, a cat purring recorded too close to the phone mic, and the least offensive metronome he could find. He printed sign-in sheets with intentional cruelty to the penmanship of the citizens. He promised himself to be generous with the first person who tried to turn a question about counting into a complaint about litter.

The workshop attracted twelve people if you counted the one who came for the cookies and left with a brochure on catalytic converter theft. They gathered in a community room whose carpet had lost the argument for its original color and now resembled boiled vegetables. He did not talk about the drums until the end because drums would have made the few who arrived on the brink of mockery settle in with better insults. He made them stand. He made them clap on the two and the four until their faces arranged themselves in surprise—how the first ten seconds were impossible and then the next ten were a kind of relief. He had them breathe in for four and out for six while he asked them to say their names to the person next to them because you can hide a lot of medicine in neighborliness. He watched a man who had worn a gun on his ankle for twenty years—he could tell by the gait—begin to sway in the way men do when they have been given permission to permit themselves to be less. He closed by saying that the town itself had a beat and maybe the job of everyone in the room was to keep it from going feral, and the snarkiest of the bunch, a woman with a haircut that said she had insufficient patience for anyone’s incompetence including her own, lifted her chin and said, “Fine. Teach me how not to clap on one,” and he did, and she laughed, and somebody walked out with a rhythm they hadn’t brought in.

Milo texted from Santa Fe with a picture of a ceiling that had beams like ribs and a caption that said: your song made a woman dance with a man she did not come with, and Cal, who did not need details to understand the currents in a room, wrote back: don’t ruin a marriage, and Milo replied: too late; they married their phones years ago, and Cal knew the tone of that city night even from his quiet Oklahoma living room. Later Milo sent him a voice memo recorded in a hallway that might have been a motel, the words half-whispered because the walls were thin: “You are not a drummer because you drum,” he said. “You are one because you choose the two and the four when the one and the three feel easier. Don’t let the politics make you choose the wrong ones.” Cal saved it in a folder named with a word he would have made fun of twenty years ago: practice.

Monday morning bled into itself. Brown Hill’s paperwork settled into layers like sediment that could tell time if you knew how to read dirt. The recruits from his breathing lesson nodded at him in the hallway with the specific warmth of people who were surprised to have been changed by something small. The practice pad next to the coffee had acquired sticks with duct tape flags on their ends; someone had put an index card next to it that read: Do Not Attempt “Wipeout.” Violators Will Be Thrown Into The Alley, which had Peña’s handwriting disguised to look like nobody’s. Cal wrote one more email to the man whose son hadn’t come home, an email made of nothing useful and all the regard he could fit between margins. He stepped into his office and closed the door and, in the interval before the first meeting, took his pencils and played on the edge of the desk, quiet as weather, one-and-two-and, remembering the small promise he had made himself—glue, not hammer—and what it felt like, for the first time in a long time, to be in charge of a beat that did not demand blood.Chapter 8 began with a phone call that mistook dawn for a business hour and pulled him upright into the thin gray, and it was not even an emergency, which is the kind of insult mornings like to deliver. A marching band director from the high school had found his number the same way water finds the lowest place and asked, with the politeness of a person who remembers buying cookies from a kid in a uniform with a sash, if the Chief might speak to twenty teenagers about time. Cal said yes before his coffee had argued its case. He arrived at the practice field while the sky was still making up its mind and found kids in hoodies arranged in a formation that had been explained to them and defied by their bodies. The drumline, five strong and at war with their own impatience, made a sound like a ceiling fan you didn’t trust. The director, a slender man with a hairline that had negotiated a truce years ago, shook Cal’s hand with the gratitude of someone who had asked for help and not been made to feel small for it.

“You told me my wrists were wrong,” Cal said after two minutes, because sometimes it is a pleasure to finally locate the ghost who lived under an idea for thirty years. The director blinked and then laughed with the relief of a mistaken man. He had been teaching here only a decade; the man who had corrected adolescent Cal’s wrists was retired to Arizona and a diet of moral superiority and golf. “That is a great sin to lay at my door,” the director said. “I will atone anyway. Kids, this is the Chief. He would like to talk to you about the one.”

He did not give them a speech. He took a pad from his pocket the way a magician might produce a coin and set it on a drumhead to kill the echo. He told them the thing he had told recruits and the thing he told himself when the room wanted to run out of his hands—keep the two and the four like you’d keep a dog from bolting. He put his stick down on his knee and made a pattern that was stupid and therefore useful, and the five drummers watched his knee as if it had secret authority. He took their snare parts and found the part of them that was a walk instead of a sprint, and a girl with a jaw that promised future leadership smiled with the ferocity of someone seeing a trick in a mirror. The director nodded as if someone had returned a tool he’d left on a fence post. When it was done, one of the trombones—who had been pretending not to pay attention—said, “You’re the drum cop,” and Cal, repeating a line he hadn't asked for and now owned, said, “I’m the glue cop,” which made no sense to a teenager and all the sense he needed.

On Thursday, a counselor from the juvenile facility called with a voice that had to fight her own building. She had heard about the neighborhood workshop from a woman who ran a book club that was eighty percent brownies and twenty percent argument about sentences, and she asked if he could bring his quiet trick to a room of boys who did not own their evenings. The rules were seven kinds of strict and three kinds of arbitrary. He left his radio in a locker and his belt in a box and carried only pads and sticks like a harmless door-to-door salesman. The boys—five black, four white, one uncounted by such mathematics because he had learned to be climate instead of a person—slouched into the chairs with a physics that said gravity was an enemy. He did not say Chief because Chief in there sounded like a warrant. He said, “My name is Cal,” and flinched at hearing himself called that in a room that smelled like lunch and bleach.

He put the pads in a circle and watched their eyes go everywhere but the center because the center in a place like that is the dangerous part. He said, “I’m not going to preach at you,” which is what a preacher would say if he were good at the job, and then he tapped the pad with a pencil in a sound that felt like advice trying not to get noticed. A boy with a scar curving his eyebrow raised his chin the way boys do when they want to hide their interest behind their bones. Another boy took the stick like it was a weapon he had agreed to call a stick for an hour. They were bad together, then less bad, then, in a moment where the air trembled with something like surrender, they found a common one and stayed there for three measures. One of them laughed without permission, bright and quick, and another shushed him because joy is contraband in some economies. Cal told them about ghost notes like he was passing a secret note in a class he shouldn’t be in, and a lanky kid who had mastered the theatrics of not caring betrayed himself with a small, involuntary nod. The counselor stood with her hands pressed to the back of a chair like a person watching her garden sprout all on the same day. On his way out, a boy who had said nothing lifted his eyes and asked, “You ever forget how to count when it gets hot?” and Cal said, “All the time,” and the kid gave him a look that acknowledged they were talking about two things and one.

In the middle of that week, the weather stepped out in a coat of cold and made people talk about their radiators like family members. The Mayor staged a press conference with a name that deserved better sandwiches—Community Calm activation—and used Cal like a metronome, calling on him when the room got the wobbles. He stood in front of a wall of logos that had agreed to love each other for five minutes and talked about breath and beat, and Councilor Ruggles watched him like a man calculating whether goodwill could be taxed. After the camera lights cooled, the Mayor walked with him down the hall, her shoes making that expensive hush. “You’re becoming a brand,” she said, always more honest off-camera. “We could sell you for parts.”

“I’ll put it on the inventory under Specialty Items,” he said. She smiled with her eyes only, a concession she kept for men who had not embarrassed her that week. “Watch Ruggles,” she added. “He doesn’t like anything he can’t author.” Cal filed it next to the many small notes about how to move through a city that thinks it knows itself.

Milo called from somewhere where the road had changed its vowels and his voice had concrete in it. He had managed to be arrested in Tucumcari for an ancient unpaid ticket—seatbelt or loitering or existing with a guitar after midnight—and was mostly calling to preempt the story finding its way back through a less friendly mouth. “I’m fine,” he said, that refrain of men in their fifties that covers both triumph and disaster. “They like my voice here. The deputy asked me to sign a Burger King receipt. I told him to arrest me again after the show so I can get a bigger crowd.”

“Pay the fine and don’t flirt with the booking camera,” Cal said. He called a state chief he knew three handshakes over, the way men in uniforms invoke favors like they are one more tool on the belt. The chief laughed and said, “Your brother’s an idiot,” which was affectionate in the dialect of law. By morning the matter had been converted into a story to be told at bars: the singer who sang the deputy into lowering the fee by forty dollars because he rhymed it with daughters. Milo texted a photo of the citation with a caption that read, “I married the road and the road wants a divorce,” and Cal texted back a picture of his muffler pad like an engagement ring.

Thanksgiving came like a drum roll that ended in pie. The Turkey Trot needed uniforms at corners and a band loud enough to make the early miles look noble. The community conductor, wielding her pencil baton with revolutionary zeal, had asked him to strap on a snare and march because her usual drummer had been compromised by travel, which in Oklahoma is a religion. He put on a jacket that had remembered other Novembers and a pair of gloves that had a war to wage with sticks. The morning air held itself taut like a bed your grandmother made. He found the other band members arranging their hats against vanity and wind, and he took his position at the edge because that’s where drumlines live when the world is moving.

They stepped off under a sky that had already eaten most of its light. The runners poured past in their costumes of merit—shorts, tutus, ancient sweatshirts that had achieved relic status. The beat they were offered was simple because simple in cold is mercy. He found the cadence that made a jog feel like a decision instead of a punishment. At Mile One, the complaining neighbor stood with a travel mug and a scarf big enough to suggest defense; she lifted it like a toast and shouted, “You’re in key,” which is nonsense and also exactly right. He could feel the way the snare added spine to the kids who had already discovered their lungs, the way the trumpets turned corners into fanfare. June appeared with two friends and the carefully bored posture of youth indulging town ritual; she filmed him without making a show of filming him, a grace he did not miss. He missed one beat because he was looking at her, and the tuba scolded him in a key that needed oil, and he found his footing and let himself grin in a way he would never have while making a statement to a camera.

At the halfway mark a man went down—not dramatic, not theatrically, but in that quiet way that says something has slipped in the machine. Cal stopped playing by instinct before his sense justified it and was there at the man’s elbow in three strides, the drum suddenly ridiculous against his ribs. Other hands had already arrived because this is a town where the patrol car isn’t the only adult in a room. The paramedic on the bike, whose calves deserved their own union, knelt and spoke in the calm of a person who has seen worse and dislikes it every time. Cal held the man’s hand on the two and the four, squeezing without making a ceremony of it, and the man counted without meaning to and breathed in time with a drum no one was playing. When the ambulance pulled and the band resumed and the street filled again with shoes, Cal slid back into the cadence, a half measure late, and no one punished him for it. Later, the paramedic texted his department phone a single thumbs-up, and for once that icon did not feel like laziness.

The council subcommittee about noise regrouped the week after, galvanized by a developer who had decided to sell quiet like it was a view. The chambers were too warm, because power likes its rooms to be hospitable to its own endurance. Ruggles made remarks shaped like seized opportunities and then, in a move that surprised no one, asked Cal to explain the department’s position on the sounds of living. Cal had written a memo so boring it deserved a prize. He read none of it. He talked instead about the woman in Laurel Meadows who had told him his time felt like her Frank and about the boy in the juvenile facility who wanted to know if counting worked in heat. He made no metaphors about drums because metaphor is gasoline in that hall. He said the ordinance as written was a net that caught the right fish only half the time and if they wanted the other half they would have to admit they were making value judgments disguised as decibels. Ruggles attempted to make a face that said “I am moved” and instead made one that said “I have indigestion in public.” After, in the parking lot, the Mayor lit a cigarette she did not intend to finish and said, “You made boredom look like leadership,” which was her highest praise.

December threatened in textures—wind bristles, light caught in bare branches, the radio cycling carols with the desperation of a DJ held at sleigh-point. Cal bought new heads for the kit because the old ones had accumulated his mistakes in rings and he was ready to write on a fresh chalkboard. The old man from the swap sold him a set for less than any market would endorse and threw in a pair of brushes like you might slip a kid a candy he didn’t strictly earn. “For the nights that need less,” the old man said. Cal put the heads on the way you tuck anger away politely, tightening, tapping, sneaking toward consonance. The first strike on the new snare sounded like a good promise. He played with brushes and felt the sound pull him inward, quieter and somehow more precise, and he thought of the metronomes at the museum, their stubborn, polite weather. The cat approved by not leaving the room.

He drove out one afternoon to the ranch road past Robinson where the wind prints itself into the prairie with long, repeating fingers. A kid with buckets—the same boy whose neighbor had wanted to jail October—had upgraded to a pawnshop snare, and his father had put up a tarp with bungees that would lose the argument come March. They were practicing call-and-response without calling it anything, the father in a folding chair, the boy perched on an upturned milk crate because the hardware budget had gone to groceries. Cal stood at the fence and swapped patterns with the boy, ten measures each, the kind of barter that uses no money. The neighbor who had peered through the slat months ago leaned on his rake and didn't call Dispatch. He tapped his rake on the two and the four very quietly and then he actually smiled at his own betrayal. When Cal left, the boy threw him a salute that would have been ridiculous anywhere else; here it was simply currency.

The next jam night at the Red Lion had less of the ceremony of his earlier bravery and more of the texture of routine. Reese was late, a singer was early, the bartender was familiar in the way of a person who knows your order and your worst line and forgives both. Cal took the stage for a tune in a key that was more about attitude than notes and kept himself small, which is a trick in a room that wants you to bloom. He felt the band behind him like a wall that has agreed to hold. He let the ghost notes shoulder the floor instead of his ego. He looked out and saw Brinkley with the poet and Deke with a new haircut he’d pretend he’d always had and, in the back, Peña, who had decided to risk the optics by being a civilian in public. She clapped on the two and the four without looking at anyone to see if she was right. He did not acknowledge her because acknowledgment can turn a gift into a performative gesture. When the song ended, he put the sticks down the way you set a baby in a crib and moved back into the room like nothing had happened. Peña lifted her chin at him later as if to say, I saw you not have to be in charge, and he lifted his cup, water, like a man who had not earned anything more intoxicating yet.

Brown Hill didn’t stop existing just because December put lights on the courthouse. There was a vigil in the cold with hats and candles that refused to behave. Cal went and said nothing and counted breaths he did not own, making himself into one more shoulder. A woman took his hand the way you take a railing in the dark and said, “You have a metronome in there,” tapping his chest with two fingers, and he said, “It likes to wander,” and she said, “So do we,” and then cried in a way that didn’t ask for an audience.

When finals week hit, June sent a text made entirely of keyboard smash and then later, at one in the morning, a picture of a whiteboard with a schedule that looked like a crossword puzzle and the caption: “remind me to inhale.” He told her to take her exam to a pace she could live with, and she sent him a photo of her shoes under a library table, feet crossed, and he could see that she was breathing. He brought her coffee that had an honest relationship with bitterness and left it at the desk with a note that said, two and four, and she wrote back, nerd, and he felt the particular gratitude of being allowed to be a joke in your own child’s mouth.

The Community Calm workshop turned into a series against his will, which is the best kind. A church basement with a table that had seen casseroles became a place where twelve became twenty-three and the woman with the impatience haircut brought cookies and contrition. They started to bring their own metronomes—apps on phones, the old pyramids that look like houses, a watch face that made a hungry little tick. He made them do the ridiculous thing where you walk and clap and say your own name on the offbeats, and a man who had run three businesses badly and knew it laughed like a boy getting away with something. He let them talk about the racket their neighbors made and steered them back to the idea that maybe rhythm is the best you can ask of a street. A retired nurse raised her hand and said, “What about when your heart is always on the one,” and he told her the truth, which is that on those days you choose to count other people instead.

On the last Thursday before Christmas, the station threw the ugly sweater party in the garage the way a family does their makeshift holidays, with a patience for nonsense. Deke erected a string of lights that would have violated code anywhere else and hung a sign that read: “No Drum Solos Without Permit.” Someone had stolen the practice pad from the coffee station and made it the centerpiece of a table strewn with cookies decorated in a way that suggested trauma. Rizzo banged out a “We Will Rock You” that finally matured into something like funk and then bowed as if to say, the court acknowledges its own performance. Peña wore a sweater with a tree that blinked in a cycle only she could tolerate and, when no one was watching, executed a paradiddle against her hipbone with her index fingers, a small, satisfying betrayal. Cal stood with a paper plate of nothing in particular and watched his people perform their version of ordinary. He kept time in his foot and didn’t need to announce it.

Later, when the garage was cold and the cake had been reduced to a map of frosting decisions, he went home and sat at the kit with the brushes. The neighbor’s curtains breathed against their own rods in the draft and consented to forgive him another hour. He played lightly, whispers on skin, a sound that allowed you to think. The house felt inhabited by something better than tiredness. A train horn in the distance agreed to be in the band. The cat, who had made a life of pretending to be unimpressed, arranged himself on the couch and purred at exactly sixty-eight beats per minute, and Cal found it without making it obvious. His phone lit with Milo’s name and a voice memo began without hello, a riff on the theme of two and four, a line about a man who learned to do nothing loudly and something quietly, and then at the end a raw laugh. When it ended, the room held the echo like a bookstore holds heat.

He texted June, against his own rule about leaving her alone during finals, a picture of the brushes lying like small surrender on the snare. She sent back a check mark and then, after a minute that felt like a rest, the words: proud of you, which is a sentence that has more weight per letter than it seems. He did not cry because his body had used its allotment that month at the kitchen counter over a screenshot. He counted once through and then again. He put the sticks away because putting them away sometimes is the point. He took his own advice and sat in the quiet as if it were a word he was trying out for the first time, and the room did not punish him for it. The wind went past, not a complaint for once but a suggestion. Somewhere a metronome was ticking on a mantelpiece no one dusted enough and it did not need him. He was allowed to be off duty and on time at the same moment, which is the kind of miracle you can live with.Chapter 9

Winter settled in with the patience of a bureaucrat and the flair of one, too, a slow accrual of cold that filled the corners first and then the middle, a gray that made the world look like a photograph even when you were in it. The station resurrected its winter ops binder from the drawer where the ghosts of past Januaries lived, and Peña walked into his office with a roll of contractor bags and a schedule for who would sleep on cots if the grid gave up. Harmon put studs on his tires and swaggered as if he had invented weather. The practice pad by the coffee pot kept its heartbeat in spite of the draft that made the seal on the back door complain. Cal read emails like he was clearing snow off a windshield with the wrong end of a scraper. He kept the brushes in his bag because the house had decided to ring with every note that wasn’t velvet.

A box from Santa Fe arrived with tape that had seen things and a return address written in a hand that looked like it had been taught by a guitar pick. Inside was a small shaker carved like a bird and a note on motel stationery that said, stole this fair and square from a market where the dust knows my name. Use when the room is a library. Under it, as if Milo had been morally obligated to hedge his own tenderness, lay a postcard of a turquoise sky and red rock jumbled like a language about to attach itself to a person. Cal shook the bird once and heard the soft sand sound of a thought that had decided not to interrupt. He put it on his desk where pens go to be judged, and he put the note in his wallet because things vanish on you when you don’t give them a second home.

The courthouse lit its tree on a night so clear it felt impolite, the stars making a public display of their availability. The community band had drawn the slot between the mayor’s remarks—max two minutes, she had told herself and then ignored—and the hundred phones pretending to be candles. Cal wore a hat he could keep without looking like a man who had given up. He warmed his hands on the snare head as if it had been designed for that purpose and counted the children whose parents had welded them into coats. The march went off without a scandal. He kept his left hand polite and his kick foot on its best behavior. The sousaphone made jokes you had to have grown up here to get. When the Mayor leaned toward the podium as if it might try to run, she smiled in the direction of the band, which is as much credit as anyone ever gets after they’ve played every fight song since the Reagan administration.

Councilor Ruggles stood on the periphery with his scarf knotted in a way that implied taste. He watched the band like a man watching an investment grow and approached just as the conductor was telling the flutes to pretend there was joy in vandalism. “Chief,” he said, making Chief a word with angles, “the Chamber’s talking about your community classes. There’s talk of moving them under our umbrella so we can scale. Branding. Reach. Deliverables.” He said deliverables as if it were an expensive dessert.

“I’m content with twelve people and a folding table,” Cal said. He knew the dance Ruggles was rehearsing. You gather something authentic, then you put a logo on it and slowly it becomes a spill you mop rather than a cup you drink. “You’ll get bored with serenity, Councilor. It doesn’t poll well.”

Ruggles did that small shrug men do when they want to seem like they can afford to let the boat drift. “Think on it,” he said. “We could do pillows with slogans. ‘Keep the Beat Norman.’ The grandmothers will trample one another.” He smiled, which may have been humor. When he left, the band began in earnest the hymn to the shopping season, and Cal felt the tension he always felt between playing a thing and endorsing it. He put the two and four where they belonged and left his opinion to the wind.

The thefts started small and silly enough to shrug at, if you were not the one who lost the thing. A saw from a garage, a set of sockets that could have been mislaid, a trumpet case from the backseat of a car that had been locked except for the one door that never really was. Then a man on Hastings woke to find the side door of his shed broken by someone who had done this a while, and the list of what was gone could have furnished a workshop and half a living. When the reports came—the sound of dispatch in his ear smoothing out names into addresses, a cadence that had become a hymn in its own right—he felt the tug to go himself, because there is a kind of quiet left by theft that the crime scene photos do not catch. He showed up at the house on Hastings where a woman with hair in a bandana had lifted the broken lock onto a chair like it had a temperature. Her husband, a man whose hands were a CV, pointed at the empty where his tools had been with a grace that annoyed him. “I was up,” he said. “You can’t watch the whole world.”

“No,” Cal said, and wrote that sentence down in the space where you officially write model numbers. He stood in the doorway of the shed and listened to the way the cold made the absence more articulate. It is one thing to have a thing stolen; it is another to have the room that held it turned into a witness. He walked the fence line because sometimes that makes your blood believe it can find something the eye missed. The neighbor—the very same neighbor of banana bread and bullet-pointed treaties—stepped out in a fleece that forgave no body. “Tell me you’re going to shoot somebody,” she said, and then flinched at her own silly. “Tell me you’re going to at least call their mother.”

“I will do everything that looks like the law and one thing that looks like kindness,” he said, which was the truth and also, on some days, a hedge. She lifted her chin so the cold would not get the satisfaction of closing her throat. “They took his father’s drill,” she said. “Which is less valuable than a breath of air and also the whole world.” The husband did not look up. He pointed at the empty again, not because the empty needed help, but because his body had to do something besides make a fist.

He ran the visits the old-fashioned way. Pawnshop to pawnshop with a face you put on for people who have learned to read faces. The wooden counter at Abel’s had been polished by hands that counted cash and hung on questions. The old man from the swap was there like a figure in a painting, his beard a climate. “Somebody brought in a wrench set with initials carved in case,” he said by way of hello, because he had always believed that the best starting point was the middle. “Not those initials,” he added, as if saving Cal a trip to an emotion. “But people get ideas in the cold.” Abel himself leaned on the counter and introduced his suspicion without apology. “Every winter somebody feeds a heater with a thing that belongs to someone who sleeps next door,” he said. “I try to buy the story and sell back the tools where I can. I do not always succeed.”

Cal flipped the pawn slips like a man shuffling the last deck in town. He took copies because formalities keep the wolves honest. He asked the old man to call if a trumpet walked in with a sticker peeling at the bell. The old man agreed by not saying no. On the way out, Abel watched him. “I hear you’re the drum chief,” he said, and the label had spread farther than he preferred. “If you see a cymbal with initials BC scratched in wrong side, it ain’t mine, but tell me. I want to know where BC learned his manners.”

In the afternoon the weather decided to turn a nuisance into a personality trait. The ice moved in without drama and with malice, a slow glaze that made everything look candied. The first fall was a woman whose dog had betrayed her by suddenly remembering it was part wolf. The second was a young man on a bike who had welded himself to the crosswalk with his pride. By four o’clock the radio sounded like a house band that knew only one song: fender-bender in a bad spot. Cal took the wheel because he missed the way the town reveals itself when it’s being foolish, and because the rookies had guessed their day and he wanted to pull their hours out of the red where he could. He drummed on the steering wheel like the father of a child trying to nap. In the intersection at Lindsey and Berry, a truck had taken a turn like a drunk trying to dance, and the two drivers had gotten out on an icy stage and bowed to each other with that particular anger that winter complicates. Cal stepped between them and kept his voice on its rhythm and watched two chins climb down from their ladders, and the quiet afterward tasted like a good apology.

The warming center idea came into the room like a dog no one had fed but everyone had named. The museum wanted to be the place because its heating worked and because it had couches that make people forget to perform poverty. The Mayor, who was allergic to the words state of emergency unless they could be turned into an editorial, said yes with two caveats and a contact list. Cal walked the galleries that first evening as the doors opened to a trickle of people who had houses that had decided to behave like caves. The metronomes were gone from their plinth and in their place a video looped in black and white, a dancer moving like a bird in a slow storm. He guided volunteers toward coffee and boxes of blankets that still remembered the place they had been shipped from. He put June to work because she had the holiday ease of a college student who wanted to be useful and a patience for forms when forms were what kept people from being told no. She asked a man his name and he gave her the name he’d been called in the eighth grade, and she wrote it down quietly because sometimes you don’t argue with a person’s choice of self.

The neighbor who had thunked her cake pan at his door came in with a stack of quilts she had liberated from her own house. “Don’t you dare fold them like military,” she told a boy who was folding them like military, and then she did a better job with less resentment. A counselor from the juvenile facility came with two of her boys to move cots and he saw one of them, the lanky one who had learned how to nod without giving away merchandise, spot him and perform the calculus of whether to be spotted back. Cal gave him the nod men give when they are issuing a license to be human. He took a pad from his bag and let a few of the restless youths—there are always restless youths in any room—tap out their heat. The beat they built was sloppy and therefore good, because it kept the part of the room that wanted to escalate tethered like a dog that has learned to heel.

Later, a man in a coat that had been designed to survive Wyoming but had failed at that task asked him, with the pure indignation of hunger, why the police were running a hotel. Cal told him the truth that had made him unpopular in some circles and respectable in others: because there is no job under the city’s roof that is not ours eventually, and because there are nights when you make your enemies by the way you close a door. “You can complain later,” he said calmly. “Tonight you can sleep.” The man squinted at him like someone who has never trusted a deal that cheap. He took the blanket anyway and arranged his belongings around his cot in a geometry that said he had done this dance before.

The generator deaths announced themselves with a cruelty so matter-of-fact it ruined a man’s appetite. A family in a duplex on Acres started theirs in the garage because someone had told someone once that air is air. The neighbor called because her carbon monoxide alarm had become a character in a bad play. Fire got there and did the real work and Cal arrived in time to do the other kind, the kind that doesn’t get hung on a wall. He talked to the cousin on the curb who kept waiting for a script. He counted for himself on the quiet beats so his sentences did not get away from him. He went home and sat on the floor by the kit and did not play and then he did, with the brushes, barely enough to name the noise and not enough to make the neighbors hate him. He slept as if he had learned nothing from years of training on how to sleep well; he woke knowing that every workshop he had taught on calm would need to be taught again to himself.

The thefts did not stop just because people were cold. They became sharper in their choices. A set of toms walked out of a church basement during the hour between community meal and prayer. A green toolbox that had belonged to a grandfather left a truck bed and made someone feel like the hinge on him had been stolen too. Cal worked the angles. He pushed photos of serial numbers and funny scratches onto the desk of a county investigator who had the decency to pretend to be grateful. June set up a side search on forums where instruments go to weep, and the trumpet with the peeling sticker showed up on a listing that tried too hard to write sentences. They set a meeting at a gas station that had learned not to care what you bought; he went along when he should not have, for the simple reason that he had a face that turned rooms honest faster. When the seller arrived in a hoodie that had been dragged through every dorm hallway in town, he looked at the horn and then at Cal’s posture and then at the way the snow collected itself on the curb and decided to tell the truth badly.

He was not an architect of theft, he said; he was a delivery system. A man at a motel had a room full of things that had not arrived honestly. The hoodie had emptied his car of its last decent things to keep a heater fed, then had found this work easier until it suddenly felt harder. He did not expect the town’s sympathy; he did expect the town’s wrath; he had learned a lot of things about people and one of them was that they get louder when you don’t look at them. Cal did not make an enemy of him. He made a note of the motel and the room and the shape of the boy’s fear. He retrieved the trumpet and put it back into the hands of a teacher who had played his grief in a closet so the school would not see it. He wrote a report with sentences long enough to make someone in the DA’s office chew.

The motel room was what motel rooms always are when they are about to make everyone involved feel predictable: stale air performing as neutral, the smell of smoke arguing with soap, a television that had decided years ago it would be a window only if you insisted. They knocked with the knuckles you use when you know the door is going to end up confused about its job anyway. The man who opened had a face with a world map on it—lines for roads and rivers, dead-ends, an ocean’s worth of gives—a father if you wanted to be generous and a thief if you wanted to be lawful. He tried the thing where you compliment the badge as if it were a hat, and Cal let the compliment pass as if it had been well-earned. They stepped in and the story the room told was simple. Tools and instruments and insulated jackets made a fort for someone’s hunger. Receipts for gas and groceries lay on the dresser. The man kept saying just until and the boys in blue kept writing down the last time a person thought a season could be a solution.

They took him because you cannot not take a man sometimes, even when you want to make a different point. Cal put a note on the file that suggested a path for the DA where restitution could be the word you put in the headline instead of incarceration. He called the woman whose husband had lost his father’s drill and asked her if she wanted to be angry or paid or both. She said both, and he said he would do his best, and he could hear in her voice the particular fatigue of a person navigating how to maintain her own temperature without losing her humanity. He went home with the shaker in his pocket and shook it once in the kitchen like a broken promise. The cat watched with eyes that had voted for neither outcome.

The Red Lion canceled jam night under duress from a county that had been embarrassed by its own roads. Reese texted him a photo of the kit sitting there like a stranded animal and added a sad face that Reese would pretend later he had not sent. Cal spent the time he would have been making a fool of himself in front of young geniuses standing in the museum gym listening to the heater make the sound of a dragon deciding not to wake. A boy from juvie played his pad in the corner with the care of a person folding a flag. A grandmother from the workshop arrived with a bag of oranges like a fable and arranged them with a precision that could be read from high windows. A man whose business it was to yell about the failings of the city asked him why the police had scrambled cots instead of arresting the clouds, and Cal told him gently to get a blanket before the blankets were gone and perhaps to put the yelling off until Tuesday.

Milo called in from the road somewhere past Tucumcari where the horizon becomes a habit. He spoke the way men speak when highway has taught them tempo. He had almost slid off into the thoughtful ditch, he admitted, and had sung at the truck as if that would matter. He had learned to put weight on the downbeats in a way that kept him alive. He had traded a story for a motel room. He had found a diner where the pie had the aroma of old decisions. Cal listened the way you listen when the person on the other end is measuring himself against a yardstick he has invented. He told him about the motel and the father and the tools and the way the town had once again assembled itself as a jury without being asked. Milo told him a line he had not earned and he wrote it down anyway because it burned good: sometimes the only time we keep is the time we refuse to steal. They sat in the silence of connection that old phones cannot get and new phones do not recognize, and then they hung up and went on being who they had been before the call.

June finished her finals with the inarticulate grace of young people who believe there are too many hours in a night until there are none. She came home and stood in the kitchen in socks and watched him stir soup like it had a secret. She put the shaker bird in her hand and shook it quietly and smiled because it behaved like a good idea: present, soft, not asking to be applauded. They ate soup that had not earned its richness and made the day smaller by naming it. “You look like you’re carrying a couch,” she said, and he confessed to the generator and the thefts and the way the town had demanded he be both judge and concierge. She reached for his wrist with that familial economy that has saved more than one man from a bad tidy. “Glue,” she said, dry as a librarian. “Not hammer.” He exhaled a laugh and let the steam from the soup argue with the window. The cat threw itself on the floor as if to say, everything that is warm belongs to me.

The neighborhood workshop had its biggest turnout the night after the ice made the town discover how brave it could pretend to be. There were sixteen people in the church basement and two of them had never meant to come until their daughter or their husband told them not to be foolish. He made them walk the slow circle and clap on the offbeats and breathe like it was free. He made the man who sold insurance speak his own name to the rhythm of a song he would never admit to loving, and when the man said the name he softened it and made himself nearly handsome. He asked them what noise they hated and what noise they could not live without, and a woman who worked nights at the hospital said, “The monitor beep that means someone is stubborn and staying,” and then she looked like she had said too much and he thanked her by not making a joke. He did not say drums until the end, and then he said them loud enough to let the word scrape the ceiling and not apologize for the scratch.

When the power finally remembered the town, it came on in sections like a bad symphony deciding it was, after all, not a rehearsal. The neighborhood exhaled in waves you could almost hear. In the house two over, a string of lights had been plugged into a philosophy that said all colors are welcome even when you don’t agree with them. The neighbor with the treaties stood on her porch and watched the lights come back to life like stubborn flowers. She raised her mug in a toast to no one and to everyone and to the man who had knocked at nine and not at ten. Cal stood at his window and watched as if the scene had been written for him, which of course it had not. He sat down at the kit not to be impressive but to be honest. He used the brushes like an apology. He found the two and the four and let the one and the three belong to the day that had just ended. The shaker sat on the table like a promise that didn’t demand fulfillment. He thought of the boy with the buckets, of the man with the motel, of the grandmother with the oranges, of the sousaphone player’s left foot. He thought of the museum’s metronomes and their storm of disagreement that still made a kind of order. He played for the length of a train passing and then another measure after because he could, because no ordinance forbids the sound of a person becoming a person in his own house. Outside, the wind remembered where to go and stopped trying doors. Inside, the cat purred at sixty-eight and the house kept time.
