The kettle clicked off and shuddered, as if it had just remembered something terrible. Arjun Patel—called Ari by most people except the bank and his mother—paced the small galley kitchen, whisking eggs in a chipped bowl with a fork whose tines were slightly bent. Wembley mornings have a certain shrunken quiet, or maybe it’s just the council estate’s habit of keeping its breath, waiting for news. Outside, a gull cried out at nothing, wheeled back toward the stadium, and lost itself in the white ribs of the arch. The radio on top of the fridge muttered through the traffic report, the presenter’s voice gentled by a rain forecast. He had the feeling, as he so often did, that life was something overheard—a conversation through the wall.

He realized he was humming along without thinking, a melody that didn’t belong to the radio. His mouth formed vowels. It wasn’t even a proper tune, just the shape of one, climbing a little and then backing down. He could almost see it in the steam rising from the kettle: a line that ran thin, then thicker, and would have a point if he pushed it. Ari glanced at the clock. The minutes had a particular speed in this place, a weary swiftness.

"Stop that," he told himself. The eggs slipped into the frying pan like a pale, flat blur, and he turned the flame down. Breakfast was a ritual of not wasting things: the heel of bread toasted long, beans steeped from the tin without fanfare. He kept thinking of the shape of the tune anyway, of moving it somewhere other than the kitchen tiles, but the thought was embarrassing, so he rubbed it out with jam on toast.

He ate standing up, the laptop propped open with a message to confirm a meeting about debtors, the strategies they had for making them feel like they were not being hunted. His job at H. Harcourt & Co. Chartered Accountants had weathered several changes, but even in a dull wind it still smelled like ink and sweat and old carpet. Numbers were kinder than people; they were honest about where they broke.

He put on his coat, checked for umbrella, keys, the small container of steamed rice and mixed veg that he carried every day like a conscientious pilgrim. In the hallway mirror, his face looked like a sensible answer, neat beard, hair not exactly receding but going somewhere. Dark circles like commas, never the end of the sentence. He opened the door and the building breathed. Somebody had left a box of leaflets in the lobby, a local councillor’s face pleading with its smile. The lift juddered and he took the stairs.

On the High Road, he passed the halal butcher and the sari shop with its window full of bright rainfall. Two schoolboys galloped past, one trailing the other with a sock in his hand. At the bus stop, a woman in a purple hijab examined a bag of clementines with the concentration of a scientist. Ari’s bus slid into view, its windows crowded with faces that had done this a thousand times. He got on and found a place to stand. Somewhere toward the back, someone was playing music on their phone, the bass an impatient finger tapping at the bones of the bus.

At the next stop a busker climbed on—no guitar case, nothing to signal it except his battered jacket and the way he braced his feet. He wasn’t begging so much as announcing. He’d done it before; you could tell by the way he held his throat as if it were a fragile instrument someone else had lent him. He started singing, a tune everybody knew, and then not quite. He was almost good.

Ari felt something go hot under his ribs.

We do not sing, he thought, and the thought mocked him. His family sang: Mum at weddings under the heavy garlands, his aunties in kitchens with wooden spoons, his stepfather Gareth in loud scraps at football grounds. But they sang as event, as a riot of being alive, and Ari hadn’t been loud with joy in years.

The busker made eye contact, the kind that is less a look than a toe shoved under a door. "Your turn, mate," he said, half joking. A few passengers snorted, but there was a gap there, a space where things that shouldn’t happen suddenly were possible. The bus juddered. Ari felt his mouth open.

"Sorry," he said. The busker shrugged and went back to what he was doing. Ari clutched his lunchbox and watched the stadium arch pinch and widen between buildings until it was gone.

Work was a nice shade of beige. The office had those partitions that stopped short at the ceiling, apologetically. In the break room, the boiler had opinions about when water should boil. In the back, a ficus sprinkled its leaves as if to keep its hand in. Anita from payroll had brought in a box of mini cupcakes, each with a swirl of icing that looked like a mistake repeated until it became intentional. Ari took one with lemon frosting and tried not to make contact with the extras on Anita’s nails.

"Big weekend?" Anita asked.

"Forecast is spreadsheets," he said. "Chance of pastries."

She sighed. "Don’t you ever do the karaoke with us? Green Man on Fridays. We always say, ‘We’ll get Ari up,’ and then you run away like a fox."

The fox image made him smile. He looked at his calendar. Friday had nothing on it but a small note to check the Harding accounts. "Maybe," he said. "Maybe I’ll do one song."

"Get in," she said, pointing at him with a cupcake. "Don’t say ‘Wonderwall.’ That’s for the men who don’t know how to tell their wives they’re sad."

He laughed, felt the sound catch on something. It wasn’t funny but he laughed anyway, like a man making sure his engine starts. Back at his desk, Mr. Harcourt passed by like a dark cloud with a handkerchief. He had a habit of clearing his throat as if he was politely asking the air to make room.

"Mr. Patel," he said, barely moving his lips. "Our friends at Fellis & Sons have an issue with outstanding invoicing. Run an aged debtor analysis. And make it sing."

The word did something to Ari. He caught himself nodding as if Mr. Harcourt had made a joke. His fingers went to the keyboard the way you approach the surface of a pond, toes first. He liked the dance of spreadsheeting, the way sums could be coaxed into knowing themselves. He built a pivot table and watched the misery sort itself. In the laminate reflection of his monitor, his face looked like it was floating, or auditioning.

At lunch he ate at his desk because the staff room had a television and televisions made lunch too loud. He clicked through videos with the sound off, subtitles doing a hopeless impression of human speech. He googled "how to improve singing" and then closed the tab with a guilty twitch. He reopened it. A bold-faced paragraph: breathe from your diaphragm, like you’re filling a balloon. He pressed his palm under his ribs. If I had a diaphragm I’d have known by now, he thought.

That evening he stopped at the Green Man anyway, though he’d told Anita he wasn’t sure. The pub was starting its weekly transformation, the ordinary drinkers shifting slightly to make room for the bright-shoed hopefuls. There was a sign-up sheet by the stage, a short queue of names in various handwritings that looked like different ways of saying the same thing: please. The karaoke host was a woman in her forties with hair the color of packet noodles, heavy eyeliner, a confidence that made the microphone tilt toward her like a rose to the sun.

"New blood," she said when he hovered, and tapped the board with a pen. "Put it down there. Doesn’t have to be something you’d admit to your mother."

He scribbled in a careful hand: Ari P – Don’t Stop Me Now. The letters looked too neat, like a schoolboy’s permission slip. Anita and three others from the office had squeezed into a corner table and were conducting some kind of cheer with beer mats. They whooped when they saw him, fingers pointing, eyes bright with possibility or mischief, sometimes they’re the same.

He waited. The pub did that thing where one person’s bravery becomes a lantern and then suddenly everyone wants to walk in that little circle of light. A man with a tattoo of a koi fish did a murder to "Use Somebody" and received the ovation given to soldiers—brave best efforts are still brave. A girl who might have been sixteen if this were a film but who was in fact twenty-six sang "Back to Black" so fiercely that the jukebox bowed to her on its dark wooden legs.

"And next up we have..." the host consulted her clipboard, put on her radio voice, "Ari, giving us a bit of Freddie Mercury. Go on my son."

He stood. His legs were there, a relief. He felt like he was carrying a tray with a bowl of water in it. Don’t spill. The microphone was not cold, but it made his hand colder. The first piano chords came chunky and high. His mouth remembered the words before he did.

"Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time..."

It came out thinner than in his kitchen, but the shape was right. The way you draw a horse, you could tell it was supposed to be a horse. He wobbled on the high bits, smiled at himself because laughing was the only way not to look terrified. Some people started clapping along, others tried and failed. In the corner a man frowned into his gin, as if Ari had wandered onto his lawn and announced a picnic.

He could feel a line of warmth down his spine, a drip of embarrassment or joy—there isn’t always a difference. When he got to "Don’t stop me now," his voice met itself, and for a second—just a second—it opened up, and he felt the air lift under his ribs as if there were a space there he hadn’t previously rented. It wasn’t perfect. He mangled "have a ball" into something like "halve a bowl," and on "Supersonic man" his mouth took a detour but found its way back.

He finished. The noise that came toward him was real. It wasn’t a stadium, but it was more than he had expected and less than he had feared. Anita shouted something that might have been "Legend" and might have been "Lemon." He stepped down and found his legs agreeable. The host gave him a look that said: now you know.

Back at the table, they made room for him like a prize. "I didn’t know you could do that," Anita said, breathless.

"Me either," he said, and realized that was true, and that the surprise made him happy in a way he couldn’t put away.

"Shame about that 'ball' thing," said Paul from compliance, not unkindly. "But you looked like you were... what’s the word... enjoying yourself."

"I was," Ari said, and tasted the word enjoy like it was something fizzy.

He left at ten and walked home under a sky that had decided not to rain after all. The stadium arch was a ghost thing, a cradle, something that holds up nothing. He felt light and also very heavy. On the corner near the estate gate, a man in a tracksuit balanced a takeaway and a beer in one hand and made a short, devoted series of whistles. Ari returned one out of habit, the Wembley dialect of saying I see you.

At home the flat hummed. His mother Meera had retreated to the sofa with a shawl and a book, her feet folded under her in a way that made her look like a girl. Gareth’s shoes were in the hall like two declarations. TV noise came from the bedroom, a low roar of men in a field.

"Back so late?" Meera asked, taking his coat as if it weighed less because she held it. She kissed him with a flurry. "You look like you’ve been caught in a good wind."

"I sang," he said. He couldn’t bring himself to soften it. "At the pub. Karaoke."

Meera made a pleased sound and covered it with her hand. "Oh ho. Like your Nani. She would sing even if the rice is burning."

"In public?" Gareth appeared, drying his hands on a football towel, the Chelsea crest wearing a smirk. He was broad in the way of men who’ve never seen the point of bending. He took the air in with a snort. "What’d you sing? Nothing too poncey?"

"Queen," Ari said, braced. He didn’t expect Gareth to flinch. Gareth did not flinch.

"Good lad," he said. Then: "Don’t quit your day job. There’s bills. And your brother’s football reg fees aren’t going to pay themselves, are they? We’re all ears but we’re not fools."

Here he comes. The brother. Not really brother, but family the way London makes it: a second marriage with its stitching in view. Lewis was seven years younger and had fallen into the house and stayed exactly the same, a storm in a track jacket with the hood up till May. He came in now with that restless bounce, like the floor owed him money.

"Did I hear you say ‘Queen’?" he said, grabbing a handful of crisps from the bowl and ignoring Meera's warning look about his shoes. "Freddie. Boy could give a show."

"He did it in front of strangers," Meera told him, proud and worried. "The pub. He went."

Lewis put his head on one side and looked Ari up and down, as if measuring for a suit of jokes. "Sing me something then."

"No," Ari said, laughter and a small blade in it. "I’m not a radio."

Lewis shrugged, that loose-limbed dismissal he did. "Bet you sounded like a fish on a bicycle."

"That’s not even—" Ari started, and stopped. Meera shot him a look. The family’s pieced-together edges held. Gareth clapped Lewis on the shoulder enough to rattle him and then, under cover of that jolt, squeezed once, the way fathers do when love and control are the same gesture.

They ate leftover curry and rice and silent salad. Gareth offered opinions about men who couldn’t trap the ball if it begged. Ari washed up and sang under his breath, quiet, so quiet, like smuggling. In his room he googled "singing lessons Wembley" and found a listing for the Community Arts Centre off Ealing Road, next to the place that sold Bollywood DVDs and phone cases, an address he could draw with his eyes closed. The instructor’s name was Ola Adebayo. He clicked on her bio. A picture of a woman with clear eyes, no nonsense. She’d worked on West End shows he'd never seen, taught choirs in Hackney, consulted for children who couldn’t sit still.

On a weekend that smelled of fried things, he walked down Ealing Road with his trainers bending rain into odd shapes. The Community Arts Centre had a noticeboard that sagged under the weight of lost cats and tai chi. In room six, Ola was winding a cord around a mic stand, her movements efficient, like she was doing the room a favor.

"You’re Ari," she said, as if she’d decided his name before he could say it. Her voice had the kind of warm in it that shouldn’t be mistaken for softness. "You sing?"

He hesitated and then nodded, and then shook his head. "Karaoke. In the pub. I almost threw up but didn’t, which I think qualifies as a triumph."

She smiled. "Most of the work is not throwing up. Breathe."

He tried not to grin. "Like a balloon, yes? From the diaphragm."

"Show me your breath then," Ola said, not unkindly at all, but he could already feel the markings of the conversation she had had a hundred times. "Put your hands here. No, lower. Good. Now fill me up."

He put his hands under his ribs. He breathed wrong on purpose and she caught him at it.

"You’re lifting your shoulders," she said. "You’re telling us you’re nervous. Don’t. The air will be there whether you’re good or not. The air is not judging you."

"That’s a relief," Ari said.

She had him slide through vowel sounds. "Mee, may, mah, moh, moo," she said, and they did it until it felt like they were in a ridiculous cult. He found himself sitting as straight as he had in school. He was an accountant; he could do a scale. It held still when math made it, it wandered when music did.

"Is this crazy?" he asked at one point, aware that the question was as old as any instrument. "I’m thirty-one. I have a desk. I have... you know."

"You have breath," she said, and in this moment, a grace that made the room larger. "And the inconvenient voice you brought in with it. If you’re crazy, it’s because you can’t stop being alive."

He half-laughed, half-coughed. "I think my family would say I can stop. On a good day I should stop, probably."

"We know how to be useful. We mistrust joy," Ola said. "It doesn’t add up. And yet here you are. Sing."

He sang "Don’t Stop Me Now" and it sounded like he was doing an impression of himself doing an impression. He knew it, she knew it. She made him sing it again, slower. Again. "That 'have a ball' line," she said, and he groaned. "We’ll fix it."

After, he sat on the stairs outside the room because his feet felt unwilling. The hallway smelled faintly of glue. A child somewhere cried at the wrong pitch. He had the sensation of being simultaneously too old and too early. He texted Anita: survived first singing lesson. She sent back a string of clapping emojis and the gif of a penguin falling down and getting back up.

On Monday, the office had become a little bit sharper, as if it had been honed on the weekend. Mr. Harcourt was in a tie that remembered a better year. Ari dug into Fellis & Sons and found out where they hid their debt, no malice, just bad habits. He called them and spoke in the voice he used for clients, the one that had different edges than his regular voice. "If we initiate a plan," he said, "you’ll recover eighty percent of what’s ageing. Let’s not throw good after bad. Or bad after worse."

"You’ve got a nice way of saying ‘pay up’," the woman at Fellis & Sons said. "You ever think about going into diplomacy?"

"Daily," Ari said, and she laughed, the kind that made a person smell like tea.

He practiced breathing at the photocopier. He did lip trills while making coffee, a ridiculous bee hovering over the kettle. Anita sent him a message: you’re buzzing mate. Paul rolled his chair over and said, "What’s all this about singing? You’re not going to leave us, are you? We need your... calm."

"I’m not going anywhere," Ari said. He realized that wasn’t what he felt but it was what he could say.

That evening he took his mother’s advice and went to temple. Not because he was particularly faithful but because the music there wasn’t a performance, it was an offering. He stood at the back, the scent of incense like the interior of an old story, and he sang words he barely understood, vowels that had been shaped by mouths that came before him. The harmonium’s breath was a cousin of his. He felt for the first time that singing wasn’t trying to be something; it was remembering something.

On Friday, a week after his first karaoke, Anita cornered him and said, "Another go, eh? People have been talking."

"People?" He lifted his eyebrows. "Is this a motley crew?"

"Only Brenda from accounts and she doesn’t count," Anita said. "She said you made a face on the 'call me a cab' line like you actually wanted to be a cab. Come on. I need someone to go before me because I get less nervous if someone’s already embarrassed the room."

He went. The pub felt smaller this time, more crowded with his own expectations. He didn’t want to do Queen again. He wrote "Sam Cooke – Bring It On Home to Me" and felt like he was making a confession. When he got up there the room had shifted, it was not for him this time, but not against him either. A bloke by the dartboard said, too loudly, "If he does it like the 2010 guy I’m leaving." Ari opened his mouth and the first line fell out like something that had been waiting on his tongue a while.

"If you ever change your mind..." He had never been near Sam Cooke and suddenly he was holding his shoulder, shaky. He bent the note where he could. He didn’t do vibrato, it did him. On "I’ll give you jewelry, and money too" he angled his weight and something in the room took a small step toward him. Anita put a hand to her mouth. The host mouthed "Yes," a quiet little prayer to the god of pitch and time.

He finished to a clatter of glasses and about twenty six different claps. A man with a face like a kindly potato said, "That’s not half bad," and Ari thanked him as if he’d delivered the weather.

After, a guy with a tiny fedora that should have had its own postcode came and said, "Mate, open mic night at The Cinder Box. Kilburn. Sundays. Come."

"Who are you?" Ari asked, not quite joking.

"Nadia," said the host, stepping over with her clipboard like a shield. "She runs it. Listens first, judges later. Which is rare, I might add."

The fedora woman grinned. "I’ll put you in early so you can escape if you want to. Fed up of blokes who think they’re Ed Sheeran. We need someone who looks like they’ve done their taxes."

"I do do my taxes," Ari said, and she cackled, which felt like a blessing and a dare.

Sunday came soft and mean. He woke with that particular stomach roil that comes when you have agreed to something brave. At breakfast, Meera put poha in front of him and said, "Where are you going?"

"Kilburn," he said. "An open mic. It’s like karaoke but someone in charge cares."

"Don’t stay late," she said, like a zero-pressure threat. "Your brother’s got a game in the morning and we’ll have to get up with the chickens."

Lewis came in with his kit bag, the smell of old sweat and talc in his wake. "You coming to my match? Kicking off at nine. Broadcasting live to nobody."

Ari looked up and nodded. "Of course. I’ll be there and I’ll bring oranges."

"Bring a bed too," Lewis said. He snatched a piece of poha with his fingers, ignoring Meera’s gasp. "Break a leg," he added, and then laughed. "That’s a theatre thing, right? It’s mad to wish for that."

"Don’t," Meera said quickly, superstitious fear skittering across her face. "Don’t say that."

"It’s just a sayin," Lewis said, not sorry at all.

The Cinder Box was one of those pubs that wanted to be a bar. Red brick, black chalkboard with a menu of drinks that were named like small dogs. Nadia’s fedora winked at him from the back; she had traded it for a baseball cap that said NO, PLEASE. The room had a stage grudgingly given; someone had put fairy lights around a mic stand to apologize. The other acts had guitars or tight trousers or both. Ari had neither. He hoped there would be mercy for that.

He signed up. Nadia wrote his name and then underlined it twice. "You’ll be good," she said, as if telling him what would happen makes it truer. "Or you’ll be bad. But either way you’ll keep breathing."

He waited. A man sang a song he’d written about the Jubilee Line. It had a line about the light on people’s faces when they come out of the tunnels that made Ari’s throat sting. A woman with a voice like cracked glass sang about a mother who left and came back. Ari felt too full of other people for a moment.

When it was his name, he went and the lights were less forgiving than the pub’s. They said: we see you. He tried to sing the Sam Cooke again. The room wasn’t there for it. He lost the note and then found it two metres later. Someone by the bar murmured. He could feel his cheek twitching. He got through the song and then was done and felt the peculiar shame of having been honest without reward. The claps were decent. Nadia was generous. "It’s a different beast," she said afterward. "No telly in the corner. Your voice looks bigger when it’s just you and the room, so you notice every wobble. You’ll come back, yeah?"

"I don’t know," he said, because he was trying not to hide from the person who had just walked through him. "Maybe."

He went home huddled under an umbrella that didn’t believe in itself. Wembley glared in the wet. He passed a couple fighting under a bus shelter and said, "Evening," and they both stopped fighting to say, "Evening," and then carried on. In his room he sat on his bed and looked at his hands. They were still his hands.

In the morning, he put on two coats and brought oranges as promised. Sunday league gathered like a minor weather event on a muddy patch behind a school. The men were in varying states of youth and delusion, but they were there, God bless them, bodies trying to remember. Gareth shouted from the touchline with that hoarse authority that made it seem as if he had been given a whistle at birth. Meera had a flask the size of hope. Ari held the oranges and felt like an extra in a film about something else.

"Go on Lew!" Gareth bellowed, and he did: he went, and came back, and chopped at the ball like it owed him rent, and then slid too hard into a defender and there was a tangle of legs and yell of words and then the world held its breath for a second that felt like a long afternoon. The player got up with that stiff dignity of men who think being hurt is a crime. "Watch it," he spat.

"Don’t start," Lewis said. He had the kind of voice men get when they’re trying not to start.

"Apologise," Gareth said to no one in particular.

Ari watched the next minutes like a guard seeing shadows move. He had not thought of his stepbrother as dangerous, exactly, but he had thought of him as a match near the edge of the box. Not yet, he thought, not this.

The match ended in a draw that tasted like defeat. Back at the flat, Gareth held a running commentary for a spectating empty room. "If he’d been sharper on that flank," he said, "if if if."

Lewis sulked and then shrugged it off and then had a second bowl of cereal. "You coming round tonight?" he asked Ari. "Couple of the lads are watching the fight."

"Can’t," Ari said. He had lesson number two with Ola. He didn’t say that. He said: "Work."

"Snooze," Lewis said, in a voice that almost had affection in it.

Ari’s second lesson was about vowels. "You have to open them," Ola said. "There’s a space behind your face that you haven’t met yet."

"Behind my face is where I live," he said.

She smiled, too kind to tell him he got in his own way. They sang a line of "Bring It On Home," and she made him notice how he closed his mouth when he should widen. He felt stupid and then he felt smart and then he felt like a human being with a bone structure designed for music. He left with exercises and the feeling that his breath had been introduced to the idea of being useful.

He practiced in his room while the TV spilled sports. He went to the park and sang into the cold, small songs that didn’t draw attention until someone walking a dog smiled and didn’t look away. He recorded a thirty-second clip of himself singing the Sam Cooke line into his phone. It made him look like a cretin, but his eyes didn’t hate him in it. He made an account on an app with a turquoise logo and uploaded the clip with the caption: be gentle. It got twelve views and one comment from someone called uagoddess77 that said: your eyes look sad. He considered deleting the app then didn’t because pride can be quieter than shame if you let it.

At work, Mr. Harcourt asked him to talk to the auditors from a chain of hair salons, and he found himself explaining to a woman with a notebook how cash-in-hand ruins the arithmetic of living. "It just... it doesn’t line up," he said.

"Don’t I know it," she said, and then the two of them laughed for no reason that would make sense written down.

Anita dragged him to the Green Man again and he sang "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," as if he were winking. It played to his over-cautiousness, which actually looked like charm if the light hit him right. The room snapped along. After, a man with a debt of a nose came up to him and said, "You should sing at my cousin's wedding. There’ll be chicken if you do, and too much auntie. We’ll pay you in curries."

"Let me learn how not to swallow my breath first," Ari said, but he said it in a way that only meant not yet.

Not everybody loved this new sound. Brenda in accounts made a face like she’d smelled something not unpleasant but unexpected. "You’re not like that, are you," she said, tilting her head. "The ones who get up and perform. Feels like showing off. My ex did that. It never ended well, you know."

"I’m still an accountant," he said, and she sniffed as if to say we’ll see about that. Anita told him not to worry. "Brenda’s got a cousin who plays drums for a punk band in Worcester and she’s mad she never did. That’s the whole thing. We are all mourning our other selves. She’ll come round when you’re on telly."

He snorted. "I won’t be on telly."

"Then she’ll be right and we’ll all be stuck with her," Anita said.

At home, he put the kettle on and heard a thump from the hallway. "You got a key," Gareth barked, and the laugh in his voice said: my house, my rules. It was Lewis, of course, bringing in the night. He tossed his keys in a bowl and they ricocheted into a potted plant.

"Watch it," Meera scolded, but she did it with that softness she hadn’t taught herself to kill. "There’s curry if you’re hungry."

"Always," Lewis said, and slung himself into a chair as if he were trying to break it. "How’s the singing, then, Mariah?" He was trying to be nasty but the corners of his mouth weren’t working. Something else was making them twitch.

"It’s going," Ari said. He poured tea. The kettle could have been a drum, it was so loud.

"You could come," he said, surprising himself, surprising the room. "If you wanted to. Not to sing. Just to hear it. There’s this one woman who sounds like an ankle breaking, in a good way."

"What?" Lewis said, laughing despite himself.

"You know when something snaps but it’s satisfying," Ari said. "Like when you crack your back and you stand up taller. She does that but with notes."

"I don’t know that feeling," Lewis said, and for a second his face did something unguarded. It was gone fast.

"Nah," he added, "I’ll leave you to your arty lot. I’ve got things to do. People to... see." The pause made it sound like the sentence had other versions of itself that they weren’t allowed to meet.

"Keep your head down," Gareth said, not looking up from his phone. It was a command or a plea. Both.

Later, Ari lay in bed and listened to the house. Someone in the flat above had a fit of laughter, like they were being tickled by a ghost. An ambulance siren tested itself on the road and decided against it. He tried to sleep and failed and looked at videos of singers whose faces looked like his and some whose faces looked like nobody. He found one of a man on a staircase singing to a building and it made him cry in a way that didn’t leave him ashamed, only clean. He slept like a bruise.

The next week, the world noticed him in small ways, as if he had changed the angle of his head slightly and the light had found him. The woman at the corner shop said, "You sing?" and when he looked startled she added, "I saw you on Nadia’s page. She posted your bit. Your eyebrows are famous." He bought milk and a chocolate bar he didn’t need and took them home feeling like a balloon that had remembered it had a string attached.

He took three more lessons with Ola, who refused to let him dislike himself for longer than a minute at a time. "You get sixty seconds of self-pity," she said. "Then you are bored of yourself. Then you sing." They worked on the way he lifted the back of his soft palate, a phrase that sounded like a construction site in your mouth. They worked on breathing with quiet; inhaling as if "you’re not trying to frighten the note away," she said, and he put that in his pocket.

He told nobody about the thing he felt when he sang in the quiet room, the way it made the day hold still. You don’t say such things out loud in Wembley. Not unless you want to step outside, mate, and talk about it with your hands. But he started saving money differently, not for a house or a car, but for a microphone that was not the cheapest, for train fare to places where people would listen, for a pair of shoes that would make him feel like his feet were not apologizing for being there. He filed numbers under Singing and didn’t mention it in conversation. He bought a secondhand mic online from a guy in Harrow that smelled like cigarettes and a job done with half love, and he took it home like a pet.

Someone in the building complained about noise. Legend says it was Mrs. Patel three doors down who complains about everything including the shape of clouds. Ari put a note on the noticeboard that said: I live in 3B. I am trying not to be unbearable. If I am unbearable between 8 and 10 pm, tell me and I will become bearable. Someone else wrote underneath in blue ink: we believe in you. Then another person added: but stop doing the "yeah" bit like that.

He went back to the Cinder Box. Nadia rolled her eyes at him affectionately. "Thought we’d scared you off," she said. "Get up there and scare us back." He went early. He sang something that wasn’t Sam Cooke, something that made him island himself, a Punjabi folk song his grandmother had taught him and which he had not wanted to remember but had anyway. The room was softer than it had a right to be. Someone in the corner cried openly; no one shushed them. He came off the stage and Nadia held his shoulder and whispered, "There you are," in a way that made him understand she’d been waiting for him not as a singer, but as a person.

"Back by eleven," he promised Meera on the phone, because promises are the only currency that keep the domestic world from collapse.

"Take a cab," she said. "You’re precious. Even if you don’t think it."

He did not take a cab. He took the night bus. It rattled under him like a gentle earthquake. A group of kids sang along to something tinny. In the reflection of the window he saw his face looking less ordinary than he knew it to be, shadows making him someone you’d ask for directions. He missed his stop and laughed, and then got off into rain that had been waiting for him personally.

On Monday, gossip runs faster than water downhill. Anita whispered that Brenda had told everyone Ari had said no to being on the office team for trivia night because "he’s got the singing now," and there was a murmur of jealousy or admiration or fear—he couldn’t tell them apart. Someone stuck a post-it on his monitor that said: Mr. A "the Voice" Patel. He took it off and put it inside his notebook, where his ordinary heart beat.

He liked that some people were not supportive. It kept him honest, he told himself. It meant he had to be sure he wasn’t doing the thing to be clapped at, that he wasn’t making noise just to be heard. He had not told that to anyone because then they would definitely think he was performing. Quiet is sometimes the only true applause you give yourself.

One night he came back from the community centre and found Lewis on the stairs, eyes blazing with the kind of energy that makes objects in a room think about whether they want to be broken. "Where were you?" Lewis said, as if Ari had borrowed his shoes.

"Singing," Ari said, not giving the lie space.

Lewis looked at him like he was a puzzle with missing pieces. "You know Monty from the pitch? The big one. He mouthed off about me to the lads. I said I’d sort it. I nearly sorted it, but I didn’t, because I don’t want Gareth on my back all week so I used words, me with words, can you imagine?" He laughed harshly. "I could have snapped him like a breadstick."

"Don’t snap anyone," Ari said, his voice smaller than he meant, but also bigger. "The world is full. No one needs to leak more."

Lewis’s chest rose and fell like it was telling time. "You think you know because you sing and numbers behave for you. But out there..." He gestured vaguely to the dark. "Out there, being a lad is all I’ve got. You wouldn’t—"

He stopped and looked ashamed of saying too much.

"We have the same mother," Ari said gently. "Don’t pretend we don’t have anything in common. We both bruise. We both make noise in rooms and hope someone hears us."

Lewis blinked. The harsh in his face softened, just slightly, like butter almost giving way. "You’re all right, you," he muttered, and then ruined it by adding, "For a nerd."

A fleeting peace. Ari watched him go and felt a tenderness that almost hurt. He found himself humming without knowing what it was, and his mother’s voice drifted from the kitchen like the smell of spice. "You and your brother," she called. "Two sides of the same coin. Spend yourselves carefully."

He laughed, and it came out as a single note that hung in the hall and would not quite resolve. He couldn’t shake the feeling that somewhere, in a pub, in a back street, under the arch, something had started that was not finished. He didn’t know that when it came it would come in the shape of a leg and a crack and silence that wanted to be a scream. He adjusted the mic stand in his room to the right height and sang one more line before bed, just to know he could still make a sound when all the quiet was waiting.The morning it happened did not bring a warning. It was not the kind of sky that looks like a bad idea. It was the ordinary grey of a Sunday that planned to hold coats and warm flasks, the kind of grey that London does with muscle memory. Ari cut oranges in the kitchen with a serrated knife, his thumb remembering that last week it had learned the curve of pith like it was Braille. Meera had made sandwiches and wrapped them in foil with a tender aggression that meant she was trying to control the future. Gareth paced between the hallway and the living room like a short commute he was proud to make. Lewis came in at the last minute smelling of deodorant that thought it was a plan, boots thudding, laces trailing like promises.

They drove in silence that was not a sulk but a bundle of concentration. The pitch was as it always is in that little park behind the school—mud thinking about becoming character, lines chalked with the optimism of men who have never met rain. The men did their rituals: touching shins, spitting politely, telling jokes that had been born in changing rooms and refused to die anywhere else. Kids on scooters went past like punctuation. A dog watched with the suspicion of someone who had once been tackled by a man in shorts.

Gareth took his place at the touchline with his arms folded into a square. He shook the coach’s hand with more ceremony than necessary. Meera distributed sandwiches as if the men would eat them during the game, which they would not, but she needed to be useful or she would start praying in Punjabi and English and then start calling on gods by their nicknames. Ari held the bag of oranges like an offering and tried not to watch his stepbrother in a way that would spook him. He caught Lewis’s eye once; they exchanged a clipped nod that meant more than they could afford to say.

The whistle went and the game unwound itself like string from a cheap jumper. It was not elegant. It was legs and breath and the miracle of adults remembering speed. Lewis started well—he had that lean to him that says I know where this goes. He made a run that bent space, cut inside, failed to pass, got yelled at by a man with a tattoo of a crown that had never been anywhere near royalty. He took it. He swore back, light, the swear that men use to say I am here.

It happened in the second half, when the park had relaxed into its own small weather. The ball sat up for Lewis in a way that invited temptation. He went for it with a body that trusted itself. Another boy—boy in the sense of men calling each other boys until they die—came in late and wrong, studs up, because the body trusts itself and the brain forgets what could happen. There was a sound. It was not the crack of a movie bat on a movie skull. It was smaller, woodsier, like a pencil snapping in a quiet classroom where you are not allowed to speak. In the silence after, the world decided what to do with this new information.

Lewis did not scream. He made a noise like a sentence that had nowhere to go and then ran out of road. He went down and clutched his leg and the referee blew the whistle as if it could reverse time. Someone shouted "Jesus Christ" with a conviction that could not move the bones. Gareth was already on the pitch by the time Ari remembered his feet. Meera covered her mouth and then uncovered it as if she could catch the broken thing with her hands.

Ari knelt. He had never been on this kind of grass with someone he loved making the sound you make when your body surprises you with its limits. The leg was wrong. It was wrong in a way that the mind refuses at first. His own stomach rose in protest and he made it sit down with the authority of an older brother he had never been. He took Lewis’s hand and said his name and then, because there was nothing else to say, he said, "Breathe."

The ridiculousness of it—telling a person in pain to breathe—should have embarrassed him. It didn’t. Ola’s voice came up in his mind as if it had been waiting at the bottom of a stairwell. The air will be there whether you’re good or not. The air is not judging you. He said it again, "Breathe," and then he did it with Lewis: in, two, three, four, out, two, three, four, trying to make a small raft on which they both could float for a second. Lewis’s eyes were slick with furious tears. He squeezed Ari’s hand like he was wringing out a shirt.

The ambulance took longer than it should have, because this was not a stadium and there were only so many machines available to ferry broken promise and broken bone. The other lad stood at the edge of the cluster with a look on his face that said he wanted to be the kind of person who said sorry and had forgotten the logistics. Gareth looked at him once in a way that could have replaced the ambulance and then turned back to his son, because there are different kinds of damage and you cannot do them all in one day.

"Don’t look," Meera said to herself, and then looked. She stroked Lewis’s hair with the desperation of mothers who try to smooth pain into obedience. "They’ll fix it," she said, to the mud, to the men, to the sky. "It will be fixed."

The paramedics made the circle of people widen with the professionalism of those who have practiced moving grief into a van. They splinted and lifted and said things like "sharp scratch" and "nearly there," which are small lies told in the service of truth. Ari climbed in because he was nearest and because Meera had made herself into a small sun of worry that could not leave the ground. Gareth stayed outside with his hands making fists and then persuading them not to be fists. The doors shut with that ambulance finality that makes you feel like an extra in your own life.

Northwick Park Hospital was a combination of fluorescent light and patience. The waiting room had the bland charity of institutions that see everything and call it Tuesday. A television in the corner told half a story about weather and then someone changed it to a wildlife programme and then someone else turned it off because lions felt obscene while pain had its hands up. They triaged Lewis with a kindness that made the business of bureaucracy seem benevolent. In a corridor that smelled like cleaning products and something indefinably human, Ari sat on the edge of a chair and watched his stepbrother’s face drift and clench at intervals.

"You all right, love?" a nurse asked Ari at one point, because he had been holding himself like a note.

"We’re borrowing air," he said, and she looked at him as if he had said something both true and inconvenient. She put a paper cup of water in his hand and told him to drink it as if it were medicine and he did, grateful for instruction.

Gareth paced the corridor like a man who had misplaced a century. He argued with a vending machine, then apologised to it. He gave the other lad’s name to the air as if recording it formally. Meera sat with her shawl drawn around her shoulders tightly and counted prayers. The family made a small, weathered island in a sea of people who were also islands. A child howled after a vaccination and then giggled as if both noises were a set. An old man slept with his mouth open, dreaming of trains. The particular democracy of illness laid its hand on everyone’s head and said, you are all the same for a minute.

They set the leg. Ari was not allowed in to watch, and he did not want to be, not because he could not stand it but because he wanted Lewis to be surrounded, for once, by a world that knew exactly what it was doing. He walked to the end of the corridor and back, calibrating his breath to the rhythm of the automatic doors opening and closing. He found himself humming, a vowel shape with nowhere to be, and caught the sound before it got him in trouble with someone’s idea of appropriate behaviour. He pressed his knuckles to his lips and stood with his forehead against a window that looked out onto a car park and a sliver of sky.

You sing when you can’t say. The thought arrived like a bird he didn’t own. He pushed it away and then let it sit on the sill inside his head.

When they brought Lewis back, he was in a plaster palace. His face had the slack, post-adrenaline handsomeness of the recently damaged. He blinked like a newborn owl. Meera stood and put her hand on his chest as if to check it was still a chest. Gareth asked a question that wasn’t a question: "Fix it then?"

The doctor had the voice of a man who had said the sentence enough times to have sanded all the phrases down to gentle. "We’ve aligned the fracture and immobilised it. It’s a clean break." He looked at the little group and saw too much need in the shape of it. "It will heal," he said, as if he had been given authority by someone more important than himself. "He’ll need to be careful. There’ll be physio. The usual. It will heal."

Gareth nodded and nodded again as if to encourage the words to be true. Meera made her own small nods, the nods of a person trying to shepherd a blessing into the room. Ari watched Lewis’s eyes, and in them saw the place where a boy takes a sudden step into being a man and then wonders if he has done it too fast. It was not just pain. It was the accounting of a self who led with his body and now had to renegotiate the rest.

They went home with instructions, a wheelchair that squeaked its opinions, and a bag of medicine that looked like sweets for a giant. The flat had not been designed for plaster. Doors were narrower, corners sharper. Lewis swore at a chair and then apologised to it because he was not a monster. Meera fussed until fussing became the whole day. Gareth retold the tackle to three different people on the phone, each time making it less an accident and more a parable of what the world does if you let it. Ari made tea and then forgot he had made tea and made more.

The first night was a geography lesson. Where does the pain go. Where does the water go. Where does the anger go. It spread itself around the flat like a guest that stayed. Ari found a rhythm only because there are only so many things you can do in such circumstances: the turning and lifting, the pill at the right hour, the hoofbeat of the crutch on tile. He took to saying "on the breath" in his head when he moved Lewis, as if the air could be a partner in this small choreography. He sang under his breath once, and Lewis shot him a look that said absolutely not, and then ten minutes later said, grudging, "That thing you do. The hum. Do it. Not like a show. Just—do it."

So he did, quiet, vowels without consonants, as if to avoid alarming the pain. Meera looked up once with tears on her cheek that had not asked her permission. Gareth pretended the television had said something funny and laughed at that.

Ari called in to work and left a message because the moment for direct speech had passed him on the stairs. Mr. Harcourt returned the call with the deep courtesy of a man who cannot believe other people’s lives insist on their own emergencies. "Of course, Mr. Patel," he said, throat cleared twice. "Family. We cannot resent that. Only—see if you can send across the Fellis analysis by end of day. And if you must be unavailable, be unavailable in an organised fashion." Ari promised with the neatness of someone signing for a package they had not ordered.

He worked at the kitchen table with Lewis’s groan travelling down the corridor in small boats. Numbers did their clean click into place while the rest of the house refused arithmetic. Anita texted: Heard about Lew. Is he okay? Do you need anything? I make a soup that cures even the worst bad decisions. He replied with a thank you that did not say please. Later she sent a photo of a Tupperware on his desk with his name on it and the note: do not let Paul take this, he is a raccoon.

Ola wrote: breathe the way I showed you. It calms things that aren’t voices. Ari smiled at the phone and then sighed because who has time to smile when the kettle is boiling and the medication schedule looks like a choir arrangement. Nadia posted in her open mic group: Life happens. Bring what you can. He liked the post and said nothing because he had nothing to bring that would not feel like the wrong offering.

The days rearranged themselves into a strange little parade. Physio came into them with a name tag and a smile that held its own line. The physiotherapist was a woman called Maya who had calves like the kind of person who rides a bicycle on purpose and eyes that took in the whole person even when she was looking at a leg. She made Lewis move his foot in circles he called insulting. She coaxed him past his anger as if she were drawing out a splinter with honey.

"Lots of lads get stuck right here," she said conversationally as she measured his range of motion. "Somewhere between the pain and the idea of themselves. But you’re not lots of lads, Lewis. You’re you. Let’s get the foot moving like a foot again. It used to know how, it can relearn." He rolled his eyes and did as he was told because she made doing what you were told feel like an act of agency.

Ari liked Maya immediately not because she was kind, though she was, but because she spoke to his brother in a way that didn’t make him either precious or a problem. She turned to Ari once and said, "You sing?" as if she had been assigned that line. He blinked.

"A bit," he said, and immediately wanted to take the sentence back and fold it into a smaller shape.

"I thought so," she said, like a detective spotting the shimmer of a clue. "Breathe with him. Use counts. It’s better than telling him he’s brave. Brave is not useful." After she left, Ari wrote that down on the back of an electricity bill that had been waiting for its own kind of bravery.

Gareth softened at odd angles. He still ranted about the tackle and then caught himself mid-story, mid-gesture, and instead asked Lewis if he wanted the good cushion. He snapped at Ari about leaving the milk out and then brought him a cup of tea without comment that had exactly the right amount of sugar. Men in this house sometimes apologised with appliances. Meera grew a new layer of tenderness like skin forming over a wound, and then snapped at everyone for existing in the hall at the same time because the kettle was in danger and some standards must be held.

In the cracks of the day, Ari sang. It was never a song all the way through. It was pieces in the bathroom, a rosemary plant on the sill as his only audience. It was a phrase in the stairwell, which the stairwell loved because stairwells will always amplify what is not supposed to be there. It was an old folk song under his breath while he put on shoes. He did it not because he was practising but because it had become a reflex the way some people mutter a prayer when the bus leans too hard.

One evening, the Green Man texted him through Nadia with that odd modern intimacy where pubs now had personalities. You come when you can. We’ll save the good microphone. He typed a reply and deleted it, and then sent a little heart because a heart is the laziest and bravest thing sometimes.

Brenda from accounts did not know how to be nice about a fracture. "I broke my wrist in ’98," she told him on the phone when he checked in about some numbers. "Terrible business. You never get the same you back, is the thing. Anyway, are you going to sing at the summer BBQ still or is that not appropriate, what with all the bones. People do say it’s good for morale. Not the bones. The singing." He said something neutral and then muted the phone and made a face at the ceiling that made the ceiling feel seen.

At night, when the house had agreed to sleep in instalments, Ari sat in the half-light of the living room with a cup of tea cooling to its grief and scrolled through videos like a thief. He found a clip of an old singer in a community centre that looked like a cousin of his own. The woman was not young and the sound that came out of her made the audience look like they had been given a new word for their mother. The comments under the video were mostly about the colour of her dress and the impossibility of that note, and he thought, nobody writes down the time you needed air and found it.

He went back to see Ola when the house could spare him for an hour and handed over his apology with his face. She waved it away. "What are you carrying in your shoulders?" she asked instead, and he knew she was not asking about muscles. "Breathe like you are not a corridor for other people’s noise," she added, and he wanted to cry at the idea of it. They worked on a song that wanted more of him than he wanted to give. He sang it messily and then less messily, and then she made him sing it with his hands by his side like a person who believes they are allowed to take up air. He left with his throat feeling like a window had been opened and the weather had changed and he had somehow predicted it.

Money pressed in. Extra physio that the NHS would not rush. A brace that cost more because it was better. Bus fares multiplied like rabbits. Ari looked at his spreadsheet, the quiet one he kept for the family, and moved things around with the guiltless efficiency that comes from necessity. He did the mathematics of care and found that numbers bend if you ask them not unkindly. The man from the wedding—the debt of a nose—called again, all affability and poultry promises, and this time Ari said, "When is it," in a voice that left room for yes.

"It’s next month," the man said. "Cousin. Big affair. She likes Sam Cooke and also that song from that film, you know the one, with the men and the women."

"That narrows it down," Ari said, and the man laughed like they were conspirators. They agreed a small fee that would make a difference and would not mortgage his soul. He hung up and told no one because he had not earned bragging rights; he had earned a folding chair and a microphone with someone else’s saliva on it and that would be enough.

Lewis had good days and days he called not days. On the good ones, he could turn his anger into jokes and his jokes into a version of himself that had mercy. On the not-days he sat with the curtains half-drawn and played FIFA like a rosary, fingers counting out a belief he wasn’t sure he held. Once, in a rare unprovoked tenderness, he said to Ari, "I watched that video of you. On the thing. The turquoisey one. You looked all right. Not embarrassing. The bit where you went sore on the top note was funny but also… not bad."

"I prefer to call it 'expressive vulnerability'," Ari said, and Lewis grinned and then grimaced when his leg reminded him who was boss. "Thanks," Ari added, quietly, because the world is saved by small thanks that do not demand a scene.

They argued too. You cannot put two men raised in different weather in a small space with a broken bone and not expect thunder. Gareth did his heavy sighs and doors became opinions. Meera cried once because she had forgotten to add salt to the dal and it stood in that pot like a symbol. Ari went out for a walk in the rain that had made a pact with the pavements and hummed a part of a prayer tune because it was what he had. He stopped under the stadium arch, which had the decency to be invisible in that light, and realised that he had stopped asking if he was allowed to call himself a singer. He was not yet; he was also not not. He was in the middle, the corridor you stand in with a cup in your hand while deciding whether to enter the room.

On a Thursday that had no business being difficult, the boy who had done the tackle turned up at the flat with his mother holding his sleeve. They stood awkwardly in the doorway with a bouquet that looked like it had been stolen from a nicer life. The mother spoke in urgent apologies that tumbled over one another like shoes in a hallway. "We are so sorry, so sorry," she said. "He is stupid sometimes. He is not… he is not bad."

Gareth had a look on his face like a clenched fist loosening but not decided about it. Meera took the flowers because she would take even poorly executed olive branches and find oil in them. Lewis, from the sofa throne, said nothing at first, then said, "All right," and then, after a beat, "It happens." The boy stood straighter as if allowed back into the human club. Ari made tea because this was England and there were rules about bridges.

After they left, Gareth sat heavily and said, "You see, see," as if the saying had achieved anything. Lewis shrugged. Later, alone in the kitchen drying cups, Gareth said to Ari without meeting his eyes, "He’s yours, you know. Not by blood but he is." He frowned at his own tenderness, as if his face were not yet used to it. "You did right. With the breath and that. I would’ve shouted. I did shout. I shout."

Ari wiped a cup as if it needed polishing and nodded. He didn’t say, I am learning to make noise that does not bruise. He didn’t say, thank you. He put the cup in the cupboard and the cupboard received it like a secret.

When the call came from Nadia about a showcase she was putting together—"little lineup, nothing fancy, local artists, bring your stubbornness"—he looked at the calendar on the wall where Meera kept track of the medication times with little suns drawn around them. The date was the same as Lewis’s first longer physio session. There was no choice, and yet he felt the old ache that comes when something you want bumps into something you love. He told Nadia no and she said, "That’s all right, man. There’ll be others. The thing will wait. The thing has patience for you whether you deserve it or not," and he laughed because who talks like her and then he put the phone down and stood for a moment in the doorway of his own life.

That night, when the flat was finally quiet, he took his secondhand microphone from its box and held it in his hand like an answer he didn’t know the question for. He plugged it into the cheap amp that fizzed like a sherbet sweet and sang not to practise, not to move forward, but because the day had to be sung out of his body or it would grow moss. He sang something small and then something old and then something that sounded like a prayer if you weren’t listening closely. He kept it low because of the neighbours and because the house was sleeping and because not all songs want to be large. The sound felt like a hand inside his chest moving furniture, making space.

In bed, he lay with the familiar weight of London on the ceiling and thought about legs and breath and the way some things break and make you. He didn’t know a person could measure days not in hours but in repetitions of being good to someone. He turned on his side and let sleep come as if sleep were a bus he had finally learned to flag down without looking like he was pleading.

Morning arrived with its cheap drumroll of bin lorries and arguments. The kettle clicked its apology for the noise it was about to make. Ari put two slices of bread in the toaster and watched them the way people watch fireworks, hopeful and faintly ridiculous. Meera came in with her shawl and a question about turmeric. Gareth rubbed his jaw and asked if there was more milk. Lewis shouted from the other room for somebody, anybody, to bring him his patience. The house answered as much as it could and the rest was left to the day.

On the bus to work, Ari stood in that sway that had become a muscle memory. A boy played music on his phone loud enough to make old women think about cursing. A woman in a purple hijab looked out of the window with that peculiar privacy London grants you when you are among people. He looked down at his hands and saw that they had become useful in new ways. He closed his eyes for a second, breathed in, breathed out, and, without meaning to, found the centre note of himself and held it for a beat before the stop bell dinged and the world demanded its change.Chapter five began on a Tuesday disguised as a Monday, the sort of day that has already eaten its own lunch before eleven. Ari reached the office earlier than he meant to and found it tastefully deserted, as if the furniture had come in to think without them. The ficus had done a small shedding, proof of life by way of loss. He put his bag down, opened his laptop, and felt the familiar relief of numbers lining themselves up to be told what to do. He had learned, lately, to inhale before the first keystroke as if the day were a song and he had to land on the right note or spend the rest of the hours apologising.

By ten Mr. Harcourt was circling, his handkerchief already on its second outing. He tapped Ari’s partition with one bony knuckle in a way that suggested he wanted to scare dust rather than people. "Patel," he said, voice like a folded map. "Would you be so good as to join me in the small boardroom at eleven. Re: Fellis & Sons, and our new friends from Belmarsh Hair Consortium. Bring your graphs. And bring that calm of yours. It unsettles me, but it settles them."

Ari smiled with two corners of his mouth, which is the most you can give a man like that without starting a rumour. He glanced at the time and felt that peculiar pinch of being needed by two different worlds. He texted Meera to check the physio time, texted Lewis a cartoon leg with a superhero cape, and got back an emoji of a man lifting weights with his face. Numbers, humans, breath; a sibylline trio. He adjusted the font on his charts until the percentages looked friendly but firm. He found himself humming under his breath—"mee, may, mah" disguised as office noise—and laughing, quietly, when he caught it, because who does scales in Arial.

In the small boardroom the air smelled faintly of toner and disappointed sandwiches. Mr. Harcourt arranged his tie with the reverence of someone setting a table for a deity. Two representatives from the hair consortium sat on the other side of the glass, a woman with green nails who broke a biro and didn’t apologise, and a man whose hair had been told sternly to look like it woke up like that. Ari walked them through the aged debtors as if it were a park he took his mother to, pointing out where the path narrowed, where the pond lay. He noticed, mid-flow, that he was breathing in the way Ola had taught him, unimaginatively, like a person who had decided to live another fifteen minutes. He modulated without thinking, made room in his voice for their worries. When he finished the woman with the nails tipped her head and said, "I like the way you make it not sound like a threat," and Ari said, "That is our house style," and Mr. Harcourt made a noise that could have been approval or a bit of biscuit going down the wrong tube.

Back at his desk, Anita messaged him a photo of a plastic container on his chair. Soup. Yellow and promising. A note stuck to the lid: use spoon not straw, i asked paul and he said the straw was more efficient and he is wrong. He held the tub like a present and reminded himself he was still the sort of person who accepted gifts without making a speech. Brenda pottered past, her frown as busy as ever. "I suppose you’re too famous for quiz night now," she said, in the tone of someone finding fault with a blue sky. "I suppose you’ll be doing duets with Lorraine from reception instead of knowing who won the FA Cup in 1972."

"Aren’t you the one who won’t play unless you can bring your own pen?" Anita called from the kitchenette, nails a public service announcement. "Let the man have a hobby that doesn’t involve guessing the names of Scandinavian capital cities."

"I like pen hygiene," Brenda retorted, and flounced in a way that was less flounce and more sturdy repositioning. Ari ate the soup with an inch of gratitude. Turmeric and ginger; it tasted like someone scolding him into wellness and hugging him at the same time.

That evening, after he had done the physio shift and the washing up and the complicated dance of persuading a cast and a shower to coexist, he walked to the community centre without telling anybody. The building breathed people in and out as it always did, its noticeboard more aspirational than ever. In room six Ola had an a capella group doing something to an old pop song that made it sound like a hymn. She clocked him in the doorway and finished her bar before she came to mock-scowl at him. "You deserted me," she said without heat. "For an emergency, I know. I’m not unreasonable. Come, don’t stand there like an apology in trousers."

He went in. The group, mostly women of the kind of age that terrifies the world by seeing through it, gave him the cheerful appraisal reserved for new puppies and lost men in haberdashery. Ola finished with them by making them flap their arms and elongate their vowels like geese doing yoga. When they left, smelling of rain and competence, she turned to Ari. "How is the house with a broken thing in it?" she asked.

"Every object has an opinion," he said. "The kettle is a philosopher. The sofa is a confessional. The crutches are angry stick insects. Also, the physio is a saint. Maya. She does miracles with scolding."

Ola smiled. "Women like that are the true infrastructure of the city. Breathe for me. No, properly. Think of your ribs like blinds. Open. Yes. Now sing that Punjabi thing you sang at the Box. Make it the size it wants to be, not the size of your courage."

He sang. He did not remember deciding to. It came out of him with that ancient familiarity that embarrassed him and yet made his body stop arguing with itself. He watched her face as he sang and saw her head tip minutely at the place where he usually flinched. "There," she said after, unnecessary word floating in air. "That 'there' is yours. You can carry that to a pub and to a wedding and to a hospital corridor. Bring it to the wedding. Don’t just give them Sam."

"I haven’t told you I said yes," he said, and realised he already had, somewhere, not with his mouth. He told her the fee and she didn’t wince but she did tilt her mouth. "You’ll take a man with you," she said. "A guitarist. I don’t want you alone with a backing track and a room of people who will not listen like students. People who eat while you sing don’t deserve to be given chords by an invisible band."

"I don’t know a guitarist," he said, and Ola had already turned to her phone. "You know Nadia. She knows everyone. She knows Ayo. He plays like he’s late for church. He will keep you upright. Pay him, don’t insult him. He’ll say yes if he has nothing better to do. Most of us never have anything better to do than saving each other’s evenings."

Ayo turned out to be a tall man with a collection of hats that competed with Nadia’s and a way of smiling that involved his whole day. They met on a Wednesday inside The Cinder Box before the bar opened, the air full of last night and the promise of tonight. Ayo tuned with a seriousness that made Ari want to tidy up. "What do you want to do?" Ayo asked, and Ari said, "Sam Cooke and a Punjabi folk thing my Nani stamped into my head. Also maybe one Queen if the room demands a sing-along and we must be mercenaries."

Ayo laughed and did that musician thing of making you sound like yourself by accident. He found Ari’s keys with unceremonious kindness. They tried "Bring It On Home to Me" and Ari felt the music change shape under the weight of wood and strings, the way a sentence changes when someone who understands you repeats it back in their own voice. They slid into the folk song and Ayo did not pretend to know what the words meant; he built a road under it anyway. They played with the space between the two, not a mash-up, not even a medley, more like handing a glass of water from one hand to another. Ari learned to count Ayo in like a person who belongs on a stage. He learned that he likes the key of A like a person likes a certain bus stop; he knows what happens after.

On the way home he bought milk and stood in the aisle looking at the red tops and blue tops like they might decide his future. The corner shop woman winked at him and put a packet of biscuits on the counter without scanning them. "On the house," she said conspiratorially. "For the singer. Don’t tell my boss. He’s me but he’s stricter." He protested and then took them, and thought, this city is the kind that slips you a biscuit when you tell it a story and maybe that is reason enough to forgive it for everything else.

At home, Meera had turned the living room into a nest of cushions and curative teas. Gareth had his laptop open and an expression like someone learning a new language against his will. "Work’s got me sat in on a leadership webinar," he said, in a tone that made leadership and webinar sound like crimes. "There’s a man on there who keeps saying ‘circle back’ and I want to circle his back with my fist." Lewis snorted and then hissed when the snort jiggled the wrong bits. He watched Ayo’s hat on Ari’s phone and gave a grudging respect noise. "Proper that," he said. "Better than your karaoke."

"It is still karaoke, only with fewer sticky floors," Ari said. He told them about the wedding and Meera’s eyes did a thing like the flash on a camera; it made the moment look brighter and more permanent than it was. Gareth did his sums out loud. "Small fee," he said, pretending disapproval so he didn’t have to reveal his pride. "Better be more than the price of your shoes and a naan bread."

Lewis was a weathervane. On Thursday he was a small hurricane with a blanket. "The lads are going pub and I get to go from sofa to bed like an elderly potato," he said. "They sent a snap of three pints and a plate of chips, the cruelty. Monty’s there and I cannot even dislike him in person." Ari sat on the edge of the sofa and made his voice like the first hour of a workday, functional. "Come to the soundcheck if you can stand it," he said. "You can sit at the back and make faces. There’ll be aunties in sequins. It’s like going to the zoo but with more handwashing."

Lewis toyed with the suggestion like a cat with a cable tie. "Maybe," he said, which meant no, then later, after a peeved FIFA session and a chicken sandwich, he said, "All right. If I can get in a car without crying and if there’s a chair that doesn’t look like it hates me." Meera read this out as victory and set about preparing a car bag with snacks as if they were going to Birmingham.

At work, the wedding was an open secret. Anita wanted to come and cheer as if he were scoring a penalty but he shook his head so hard she nearly reached out to steady it. "Not yet," he said. "If this goes badly I need witnesses who will pretend it didn’t happen. Your kindness is too loud." Paul from compliance asked, deadly serious, if Ari had registered as a sole trader for the gig, and Ari had never loved him more. "I’ll issue myself an invoice and then chase me for late payment," he said, and Paul wrote that down as if it were an actual plan.

The night before the wedding Ari could not sleep and therefore he cleaned. He tidied the drawer of take-away menus and threw away the ghost of a pizza from 2017. He ironed slowly, which is to say he ironed like a person trying to learn patience by way of shirts. He packed set lists, spare strings for Ayo, a bottle of water like a talisman, throat lozenges he had never believed in and now did. He put his small secondhand mic stand in a bag and then took it out because the venue would have one and his was an embarrassment in this context. He walked into Lewis’s room with the quiet of a cat and found him watching old football clips on mute, the men darting silent and graceful like a nature documentary lying about intention.

"You awake?" he asked, and Lewis said, "No," without looking away. Ari sat anyway. He showed him a video of Sam Cooke on television, the grain making it look like it had been filmed through fog. Lewis watched, wary at first, ready to clown it. He didn’t. He tipped his head at the chorus and said, "He makes it look like he’s just talking but on a nice day," and Ari wanted to write that down and put it in a frame.

The wedding was in a community hall that had never recovered from its past as a church. The floor was a polished argument. The smell was food and anticipation and hair product. A banner hung with the couple’s names at an angle that showed a war had been fought over it and peace declared in the shape of sellotape. Kitchens in such places are always stages, and the aunties were on them in glorious rotation, sleeves up, bangles clacking, oil negotiating with onions. The men fiddled with wiring as if it made them necessary. Children were already in a state by three o’clock.

Ayo arrived with his guitar in a case that had lived other lives. He set up without drama. The man with the debt of a nose, whose name turned out to be Imran, did introductions with the gravitas usually reserved for politicians. "This is the singer," he told everyone within a fifteen-foot radius, as if it were breaking news. "And this is the guitarist. Professional. No messing about. We will keep them fed so they sing from their heart, not from their stomach." He looked over Ari’s shoulder to say, loudly, "No plates on the speakers this time," and three teenage boys jumped guiltily as if it had only just occurred to them that a speaker is not a shelf.

Soundcheck is always hell in miniature. The room insisted on making its own echo and the microphone tried to inhale. Ayo asked for the monitors to be turned toward the past and a man in a red tie informed him the monitors only have two moods: on or being repaired by Tony, who is at his cousin’s birthday until six. Ari swallowed the portion of panic he had packed for later and sang into the cavern. A child at the back clapped after the first line, more from surprise than approval, and Ari loved him as if he were his own.

Meera arrived in a sari the colour of nicely jealous grass, dragging a tray of laddoos like a comet bringing its own orbit. She introduced herself to Ayo as if he were a suitor and Ayo bore it with the amused respect of a man who has let many mothers inspect him for magic. Gareth wore a blazer that had been to two weddings and a funeral and liked the funerals best. He kissed Ari’s cheek in a way that hurt neither of them. Lewis had negotiated the entrance with gritted teeth and now sat in a chair like a sceptre, his leg propped on another chair, his face doing that thing where it refuses pain a seat but gives it a drink.

The MC was an uncle with his own microphone and a deep relationship to his own voice. He did an opening speech that was an anthology. He thanked people you cannot thank, such as the concept of hospitality, and promised things that could not be delivered, like punctuality. He mispronounced Ayo’s name with flair and made a joke about guitarists that had been born in 1984. Ayo nodded as if receiving a benediction. Ari stood to one side and counted to eight in his head because that does not fix anything but it fills the space.

They were due to do three small sets between the food and the dancing and the speeches that threaten to be about one thing and then are about everything else. The first one was theirs and not theirs. Ayo leaned into the guitar and found the staircase down. Ari sang the Sam Cooke like a person pegging out washing in a wind that could go either way. He saw the room look and then not look, which is its right. He saw an uncle weep into a napkin on the second chorus and a teenager film ten seconds and then look at himself. He felt the song at the back of his mouth where the truth sits when you are not sure if it should come out. On "I’ll give you jewelry, and money too," he heard himself unselfconsciously use the London in his tongue, and liked it, and did not correct it. Ayo’s eyes flicked up once at the exact place in the bridge where Ari’s voice had previously wobbled and Ari did not wobble and they moved on like men daring a dog not to bark.

The second song was for the aunties. Ayo changed the guitar’s mood and Ari went into the folk song like stepping onto a floorboards he knew, which is to say with caution and joy. The aunties, who had listened to the Sam Cooke with the benevolent tolerance of people who have seen many Sam Cookes come and go, lifted their heads like birds hearing home in a thicket. They sang back without asking permission and for a minute the hall was a village square that nobody had to pretend to be ashamed of. Ari felt his eyes prick and felt fine with it. The aunties made the sound into something bigger than either of them and Ayo’s guitar found a drone under it as if his fingers had lived other lives too. Meera had her hand on her mouth and Lewis was smirking in the way he does when he is trying not to show that he is proud because that would topple the delicate architecture of his boyhood.

At the break, the couple’s younger cousin, a girl with eyeliner that could start a small war, came up and said, "Can you do ‘At Last’ but, like, not boring?" and Ayo choked on a crisp and Ari said, "I can try it without murdering it," and the girl nodded as if she had managed a good hire. Imran piled plates for them like an engineer building a bridge. "Eat," he ordered. "We don’t want you falling over and the aunties saying it was my fault." Ari ate a lamb chop that had its own love story and a piece of naan that made him question his allegiance to rice.

During the speeches a cousin spoke of the groom’s ability to turn up on time and everybody laughed because it was a gallant lie. The bride’s father cried and made it look like he was humouring himself. A small child slept under a table with his bottom in the air, that universal posture of trust. The hall’s acoustics turned the clinking of glasses into a polite hailstorm. Ari sat with Ayo on a stage step and felt something settle in him, not certainty, but the small click that tells you the door is at least on its hinges.

Then came the bit where someone wanted Queen and was subtle as a brick about it. "You lot," shouted a man in an affectionate shirt. "G’wan. Give us ‘Don’t Stop Me Now’ and do it proper, not like those geezers on Tuesday night." Ayo raised an eyebrow. Ari looked at the floor and saw his kitchen, saw the kettle, saw a bus, saw the roof of his mouth. He could have said no. He did not. The room would sing with him. He would not be alone in the chorus. Ayo found the chords that fit the room rather than the record and they went.

The first verse was fine, the kind of fine that means you won’t die of it. The room took the chorus to its bosom and shook it. Ari heard his own voice stretch to be heard not above, but inside, and the old fear tried a knuckle at his throat and found the way barred by a practice that had not looked like courage when he had done it in a stairwell. On "have a ball," he landed it, almost beautifully, which is the only way to do that line. He let himself grin at Ayo and the room saw and grinned back and that was a kind of covenant. At the middle eight he made a choice he would not have made two months ago; he dropped out for one bar and let the ladies in the corner sing the line with their ferocity and then came back in under them, and it felt like sharing a cake you baked and discovering the joy was not diminished.

Between sets, Lewis beckoned him with a jerk of his head. "You’re all right," he said, grudging, which in his language is a standing ovation. "Don’t get cocky. Your ‘supersonic’ was a bit like you were ordering a sandwich. But—yeah. Not embarrassing. And they—" He gestured at the sea of relatives and almost-relatives and necessary strangers. "They looked happy like the way football looks when nobody’s getting paid."

Ari wanted to frame that as well. He wanted to frame the whole night and hang it in a hall that would not flood. He helped Meera find a lost earring under a chair that had witnessed too much dancing. He watched Gareth do that tall walk men do when they need to feel useful and end up carrying a box. He saw Ayo rescue a microphone from a child who was about to lick it as if it were a cold metal pole. He fielded two requests for numbers that did not exist and one for "something from Bridgerton" which made him realise he was old in a very specific way. He sang "At Last" not boring and found the middle ground between homage and theft. He closed the final set with a little Punjabi refrain that faded the room down like good lighting. He didn’t cry. He filed the urge away under Later.

After, when the chairs were starting to stack themselves into south-facing flats and the floor had become a document of the evening underfoot, Imran pressed an envelope into his hand and said, "You made my cousin’s mum dance and she has not danced since 2004," with an awe that felt like praise paid in proper currency. Meera hugged Ayo and told him to tell his mother he eats enough and to come over for parathas if he is ever lonely, which is to say, if he ever exists. Gareth shook Ayo’s hand like a man congratulating another man on a joint escape. Lewis did a handshake with Ayo that Ari was fairly sure was pure theatre. The aunties patted Ari and called him beta with the proprietary warmth that makes strangers family for five minutes.

They left into a night that smelled honest. The sky was the exact colour of relief. The Wembley arch was a faint ribcage in the distance. They got Lewis into the car with only minimal swearing and a lot of choreography. At home, they put the envelope on the kitchen table like an altar piece. They did not open it until the kettle had done its piece and the cushions had been redistributed. It was more than Ayo had asked and a little more than Ari had been promised. It dazzled the spreadsheet in Ari’s mind with its possibilities: physio, a better brace, a paid bill that would sit down and stop looking at him with that face. He took out Ayo’s share and some extra, because in that room Ayo had been an instrument and a friend and an anchor; he was not a bargain.

Sleep dodged him like a bus he should have chased. He lay listening to the house do its inventory. He thought of the odd braid of his days now: numbers that behaved for him and notes that sometimes did, a family in the middle of a change they had not applied for, a city that shouted and then at four in the morning remembered how to whisper. He thought of Ola telling him to breathe like he was not a corridor. He thought of a hallway at Northwick Park, of a hall in a church that had given up and become a canteen of joy. He thought of the way Ayo’s guitar had held his breath for him at one point when he needed to rescue a word. He thought of the boy on the bus playing music that bled into the metal and he wondered if he was angry with him or for him or with him for himself.

He woke with a throat that felt like it had done work and wanted to be paid and a face that had smiled more in one evening than it had in certain months. The city had not waited for him to feel well. There was a bin lorry outside doing percussion and a fox on the wall committing a crime of curiosity against the neighbour’s recycling. Meera was already simmering something because her kitchen believed in beginnings even the day after a celebration. Gareth was watching a clip from last night that someone had already posted with a caption that made Ari blush into the kettle. Lewis was asleep in the front room with his mouth open a little, the look of men who have fought and are being granted a temporary reprieve. Ari went to his room, set the used set lists on his desk, and pulled out his notebook where he kept ridiculous things such as lyrics he would never write and lists he would never show anyone. He wrote down a line: We sing so the day can hear us arrive. He underlined it and put the book away as if a small animal lived in it and needed a nap.

On the bus to work, he stood in the bendy bit and swayed like a man who has chosen to trust physics and strangers. The woman in the purple hijab got on, the same one with the clementines, and this time she looked at him as if she knew him from somewhere and he could not decide if this was vanity or the truth. A busker got on at the next stop with a guitar that had seen rain; he was not the earlier bloke, but a cousin in the great family of London who turn breath into courage between Bow and Brent. He sang something new and something old and something stolen and nobody gave him more than change but Ari watched as a line of children looked up from their screens for one bar and that bar looked to Ari like a kind of cathedral. He closed his eyes, held a note in his chest like a hand resting on a doorframe, and then let the bell for the stop ring him back into the day, which is to say, into the next thing that would ask him who he was and wait for him to answer without panic.Chapter six began with the ghost of a song caught in a spreadsheet; it had slipped in with the conditional formatting and sat there, humming under the totals. Ari exhaled and the cells looked less aggressive. The office had acquired a temporary seriousness after the weekend, as if all the desks had agreed to be more desk-like. Anita had a bandaid on her thumb the colour of an apology. Paul had compiled a list called Things People Owe Us That Are Not Money, and had written only Respect and then crossed it out. Mr. Harcourt’s door was ajar, which in the theatre of this place meant both come in and don’t you dare.

At eleven there was a client breakfast in the big boardroom that never managed to smell of anything except biscuits and laminate. Ari poured orange juice for a man who said app-tizer as if tasting his own tongue. He stood up to do the small talk speech he’d promised—five minutes on why paying on time is not merely virtuous but efficient—and as he spoke he felt his ribs do that quiet expansion that had come to him by way of Ola’s hands. He kept an eye on the corners of the room where attention goes to die and caught it before it did. He didn’t perform, not in the glitter sense; he did what he had always done: explained a thing in a voice that did not pretend to be less human than a voice. The hair consortium woman laughed at his line about twenty-eight-day terms being a suggestion, not a fate, and Mr. Harcourt gave him a look like a ledger being pleasantly balanced.

After, in the break room, Anita flicked the bandaid with her other thumbnail and said, "You held them like pigeons." He blinked. "Gentle," she explained. "Firm, but gentle. Like a person who has both bread and boundaries."

"I will put that on my CV," he said. "Bread and boundaries. Proficient in Excel."

Brenda hovered at the microwave with a Tupperware full of things that had lost their right to have separate names. "I don’t like all this performing in the workplace," she said, not to anyone, which is the most dangerous kind of statement. "It leads to improv games and those terrible away days where we have to pretend to be a raft."

"Nobody is asking you to raft," Anita said cheerfully. "Although now I want to see that."

"I can be two things," Ari said, more to himself than to Brenda. "Useful and—" He fished for the word and it swam away. "Loud," he finished, and then amended it. "Useful and audible."

At home, Maya stood in the hallway with her clipboard like a passport. She had come to coax the ankle into remembering, and to see whether Lewis still understood the difference between his patience and his pride. The crutches were propped against the wall at an angle that suggested argument. "Today we try stairs," she announced, and Meera made the sign with her hand that wards off trouble and then asked if she should make tea. Gareth lurked in the kitchen door as if the necessary thing he brought to this was bulk.

Lewis scowled in advance. "I know how to fall down stairs. Been doing it since I was two."

"We’re learning the other way," Maya said. "Up is good. Down is careful. You only get to be clever after you’re safe." She placed a hand on his shoulder with the matter-of-fact compassion of someone who had managed men who think pain is an insult for many years. Ari stood at the bottom step, counting under his breath because numbers are a way to make time do what you want. "On the breath," he said quietly, and got a look from his brother that contained both do not tell me how to breathe and also please don’t stop telling me how to breathe.

The first step was defiance; the second was disbelief; the third was a small miracle disguised as a stair. Lewis gritted it out, his jaw doing work that only teeth know about, and then paused to swear at an inanimate bannister which accepted the abuse with dignity. At the top he exhaled the way men do when they’ve been told to be brave and have managed to achieve something else instead. Meera clapped once and then turned the clap into smoothing her sari because she had embarrassed herself and the stair. Gareth cleared his throat so his eyes didn’t have to admit to anything. Ari felt a small, ridiculous tear arrive and pretended it was dust. Maya nodded to herself, made a note, and then turned to Ari as if he were part of the invention too. "Good," she said. "You can count. Count him down when he gets cocky. Cockiness loves a staircase."

In the late afternoon the Community Arts Centre sent out an email that did not wish to be noticed and then demanded it. Funding Review, it said, as if this were something that had been scheduled by God. Ola forwarded it with the subject line If We Don’t Fight For This, It Will Become Flats. Ari read the words with that particular dread that comes when structure is threatened; his life felt lately like an arrangement of furniture that had finally stopped wobbling and now someone wanted to take a table away. There was to be a council consultation in a room at the Civic Centre with carpet that knew things. The councillor on the leaflet in the lobby—the one who had been pleading with his smile—was to chair it.

"Come," Ola messaged, brief as a door-knock. "Bring numbers. Bring that voice you use when you’re trying not to frighten the kettle."

The Civic Centre believed it was a planet. It had the echo of a place built to contain a world and the lighting to deny it. People gathered in chairs that had done too much listening. The Community Arts Centre contingent sat together in a way that made them look organised and friendly at the same time, which is a trick. Parents with children too lively for evening politics balanced snacks with dignity. A man from a badminton club wore an expression of permanent mild outrage. Nadia had put on her NO, PLEASE cap for diplomacy. Ayo sat with his hat in his lap and his guitar asleep in its case at his feet, as if anyone asked he would explain everything with a chord.

The councillor smiled like a person who knows where the money went even if he cannot tell you. He thanked everybody for their engagement and their civic-mindedness, and said the word difficult in three different ways. The officer in charge of numbers resembled an accountant in a chavvy suit, which Ari took personally. He held up slides that did not want to be held up. The gist was simple enough to make you angry: there was less, and so other things would be asked to be less, and perhaps the arts centre could become more efficient by seizing some efficiencies and offering more rentable spaces and fewer things that did not generate what could be counted.

Ola caught Ari’s eye and tilted her head. He stood up in the small queue for questions and felt that he was moving toward the thing he had been avoiding for two decades: speaking in a room not because he had to but because he was needed. When it was his turn he said his name and his address as if he were a person on a list. He did not raise his voice. He tried not to make it something his singing self would be ashamed of.

"I’m an accountant," he began, and in the row ahead someone made a small approving noise because an accountant in a meeting is a little like a doctor on a plane. "I look at numbers all day and then I go to the arts centre to do the thing numbers can’t do. You can get your rents and your efficiencies. You should. But if you only count what is easy to count you will end up with a building that is full and a city that is empty." He paused because the sentence had come out bigger than he’d expected and he had to see whether it would topple.

The councillor’s eyebrow made a note of the line. The officer looked down at his slides as if they had betrayed him. Ari carried on, finding that the rhythm of a song’s middle eight was there for him if he wanted it. "You get kids in rooms where their breath has to go somewhere that isn’t trouble. You get aunties who can be loud in a way that doesn’t scare them. You get men who work all day at being practical who find out they have a throat that does other things. And then those people go back to the numbers and the buses and the tills and the classrooms and they do those jobs better because they remember they are not only jobs. There isn’t a graph for that. There’s just a city that doesn’t eat itself."

Nadia’s cap tipped forward as if bowing. Ola did not smile; she watched the councillor like a lioness considering the distance to a watering hole. A mother in a pink coat put a hand on her child’s head and breathed out. Ayo scratched his jaw and looked grateful in the way of men who have learned not to clap in meetings. The badminton man harrumphed for tradition’s sake. The councillor said, "Thank you, Mr. Patel," as if he were tasting the name of a person who might cause him pleasantly small problems. He said the words we hear you in the manner of people who are aware of their own hearing. He could promise nothing. A promise would be a kind of song and this was not a concert. But a week later an email came—interim funding extension, further review, community consultation to be properly weighted—and Ola sent Ari three clapping hands, two knives and a pigeon, which was her way of saying, don’t you dare think this is over, but also bravo.

The laundrette gig happened because Nadia knew a woman who knew a man who had a bookshop with a functional tumble dryer. It was called Spin & Spine because London cannot help itself. They cleared a space between the biographies and the machine that always takes your pound and your hopes. A guy on a cajón made the room behave by sitting down on it. Ayo stood with his guitar and looked like a sentence with a proper verb. The audience stood in that bookshop way, polite but ready for a fight with a blurb. Ari felt almost foolish standing there without the protection of a wedding’s chaos or a pub’s deflecting arms. He tried to take the size of his voice down to hold the room’s hand instead of its throat.

He sang "At Last" like a whisper that had learned to read. He sang the Punjabi lullaby his Nani used when the monsoon wanted to get inside your bones and she did not wish to let it. At one point a spin cycle whirred into being and he and Ayo adjusted, wove the noise into their measure until the room laughed, and he realised that was the point: you don’t wait for the world to shut up; you sing inside it. After, at the tea table by till, he met the busker from the 98, the one who had once been almost good. His name was Kian. He had eyes that tried to be flippant and failed and settled for the truth.

"You did that quiet, like you were keeping a secret together," Kian said. "That’s hard. I always end up shouting because shouting is the only thing that knows it’s arrived."

"I practise not being a corridor," Ari said, and Kian looked at him like this was both nonsense and helpful. They went outside and split a cigarette neither of them wanted because sometimes a cigarette is a break that will be believed by the street. Kian told him about a sister in Slough and a flat above a takeaway that smelled like decision-making. Ari told him about numbers and breath and a woman with packet-noodle hair who held a microphone the way sun holds water. They were not friends yet, but they had swapped unembarrassed pieces of the day, which is how it starts.

The Cinder Box, capricious and dear, learned it would be something else by autumn. Rent had come up like a tide and the owner had discovered an appetite for concept burgers. Nadia organised a funeral disguised as a fortnight of showcases, this person and then that one, the poster covered in names that looked like a city remembering itself. Ayo was down to play four nights and wanted Ari on two because they wanted to be greedy. It clashed in the most predictable way with the firm’s annual Summer Social, a phrase that made everyone in the office perspire from the shins. It was to be held in a place with picnic tables and a woman making small plates of something smoked. There would be a quiz and Mr. Harcourt would tell a story that ended with the words and then of course we had the auditors in.

"Sing for us," Anita begged, as if he were a jukebox you kicked for luck. "Do the quaint one. Everyone on the last page of a spreadsheet loves to sway."

"Do not make me be the fun one for accountants," he said, with a horror that was only half joking. Yet when Mr. Harcourt, in a rare show of human awareness, said, "If you were to bring your… gift to the evening, it would not go amiss," he heard himself say, "All right," because he had been raised to bring something to a gathering or else do the washing up and there would be no taps at this field.

On the day, the sky did that hopeful British thing of thinking about being blue. The firm was a field of white shirts and outsourced laughter. People played rounders like the last thirty years had never happened. There was a Bulls-Eye inflatable in the shape of Management. Ari stood behind a trestle table trying to look like a person who had not arranged his evening like a train timetable. He had Ayo’s set to make; he had the farewell to a room.

He sang two songs for Harcourt & Co., gentle, non-threatening, the kind you could sing at beige. He did "Stand By Me" in a key that made no one panic, and a slice of the Punjabi thing for Meera by way of the couple from HR who had discovered Dilliwalas last winter and now pronounced it with embarrassing confidence. The partners behaved as if the money was singing, which in their minds it always had been. Paul cried a little because he was a person in hiding and drunk and owed nobody an apology. Brenda found a way to disapprove of "Stand By Me," saying it was too sentimental for a workplace environment and that one ought to stand by oneself. Ari bowed as if she had complimented him on his posture. He checked his watch the way lovers do, and the second the quiz ended he made a break for the bus with his shoes in his hand and Anita yelling, "Run, Forrest, run," in a way that would have got her cancelled in three boroughs if anyone else said it.

He got to the Cinder Box as Ayo was about to pretend to play both parts. The chalkboard out front said Raise a Glass, Not the Rent. Inside, the air had been distilled and kept. The room looked at him when he should have been on time and then forgave him because Nadia had her baseball cap on backwards and that means grace abounds. He walked up like a man coming late to his own wedding, which is to say, he came up humble. The first note Ayo gave him was a hand. He took it.

He sang like the place had taught him to sing: to the people who were listening, not to the idea of people. He did not shout to drown out worry. He let the auntie song loose in a room that had never had aunties in it and watched the men at the back straighten in their chairs like something had reached into their grandfather and brought out a chair. He brought in Sam Cooke and the room, ridiculous and generous as Leicester Road on a Saturday, did the oohs without being asked. He did one more, a little blues because Ayo wanted it, and then a line that should have been a cliché but instead made a woman by the payphone dab at her eye with a napkin. The applause was less rowdy than kind. Nadia lifted her clipboard as if in salute, then used it to shoo a boy off a speaker.

Outside, under the pale reach of the arch, he stood with Ayo and Kian and a woman who’d sung a song about the Northern Line and had people sighing on the off-beats because she knew where the platform ended. They smoked each other’s cigarettes like an exchange of vows and told each other stupid jokes and made big plans that would only partly survive the morning. It was the kind of after where the evening doesn’t want to leave you alone and you have to walk it home and tuck it in.

At the flat there was a box on the dining table with a cassette player inside that had done its time and still had mercy. On top was a cassette with a sticker on it that said in Meera’s handwriting Ari 1997. He picked it up the way some people pick up a seashell and then hold it to their ear as if expecting to hear a whole ocean. Meera came out of the kitchen with turmeric on her fingers and a face that wanted to be brave at something small. "I found it," she said, a little casual and a little proud. "Your Nani kept everything. I kept the everything. We don’t throw out noise."

He put the tape in and pressed down on the button so deliberately he felt the mechanism thank him. There was the click; there was that whir that time used to make. Then there was a child’s voice, his, unmistakable, that clear bell children have before shame puts a hand over it. He sang a Gujarati bhajan all the way through and then, at the end, said in a small crisp English voice, "Again," and someone—his mother? his grandmother?—laughed in a way that was not tired yet. Over it, faint, another voice appeared, masculine, newer in his memory. It was there and inside it was a shape not unlike his own, older and careless and lovely. He looked at Meera and she had the look of a woman who knew a scene when it had finally arrived.

"That was your father," she said, as if she were telling him the weather from long ago. "He sang at you because you cried when he didn’t. He was not all bad. He was not all anything." She sat. It was not a story; it was a room, and they had to sit in it. "He worked nights for a bit at the airport, not officially. He had hands and a smile. He liked to pick the song and then not sing it all the way. He left before you were finished. That is the truth. We don’t say it to be cruel. He has a sister in Leicester who still sends a card at Diwali to nobody. He sent money sometimes and one time he sent a shirt with a bad tiger on it that you loved like you’d been born to love it. He had a laugh like he’d swallowed a coin. He made us tired. He made you sing."

Ari breathed in as if he had been underwater and had come up to find the air exactly where he left it. He could not decide if this was new or if it had been there waiting for his ears to be old enough to hear. Gareth came into the doorway as if he had been in the other room practising not to intrude. He did not say, ah, him. He did not say, if I had been here sooner. He leaned on the doorframe like it needed the leaning and said, "He gives you nothing now. You take what you want from the tape and we chuck the rest," and Meera gave him a look like a medal.

Later, alone in his room, Ari rewound the bit where the child-him said "Again" until the tape squealed gently as if protesting being asked to relive the past more than three times. He put his hand on his chest and found his breath sitting docile as a housecat. He sang a line into the room and the room, which had witnessed all kinds of growing, sent it back unspooked. He did not know if he was the kind of person who would go looking for a man shaped like an absence. He suspected it would not be now; now was already full.

The next morning the city put its hand back on his head and told him to walk. He went to work with the cassette inside his bag like an extra organ. He watched the High Road throw itself open shop by shop. He stopped in the temple doorway long enough to be blessed by old women who see the past even when they are not looking for it. He bought jalebis he didn’t need because sometimes sweetness is a plan. He got a message from Nadia with the schedule for the Last Box—Ayo & Ari on Saturday at eight, then a woman with a voice like stolen silver, then Kian at eleven with his new song, then the rest of it the bar would have to hold. He got another from Ola that said simply Don’t let the room close without making a noise it cannot forget.

Work did its work. Numbers lined up and lied to him less than people did. Anita cornered him by the staplers and demanded tape gossip and then told him, in exchange, about the time she sang "I Will Always Love You" at her cousin’s divorce party and made three aunties reconsider karaoke as a weapon. Paul discovered a discrepancy in an invoice from a gym in Harlesden that was either a crime or a rounding error and behaved as if he had discovered penicillin. Brenda brought in a tray of flapjacks that, despite everything, healed.

That night, because he could, because he had said he would, because he had promised himself to make smaller, quieter, private acts of courage as well as the big ones, he went to the car park outside Northwick Park and sang one scale into the cold, then another, until it became a song, and then he stopped when a security guard coughed in the way of men who have strictly limited capacities for Art on their shift. On the way home he texted Ayo: Are you ready to hold me up if I decide to stand weird at the Box. Ayo sent back a video of his hat nodding yes all by itself.

Saturday came brazen and then pretended it was shy. The Box filled with people who looked like sorrow had made them early and joy had told them to stay. Nadia moved through the room with the relief of someone whose plan is not going to fall down. She put a hand on Ari’s shoulder and didn’t take it away. "This is it," she said. "London is a bus that keeps coming and leaving and sometimes you catch it and sometimes you don’t. But you have to stand at the stop."

Ayo tuned and the room got ready without being told to. Ari thought of the tape and the child and the crack on a Sunday and the laugh that never stopped belonging to Gareth even when he had to pretend it did. He thought of the counting in physio and the counting at work and the counting in his own breath that he could now do without counting. He thought of the cheap mic stand he had bought from a man who showed mercy. He did not think of being good; he thought of being true at the right volume.

And then he sang, and the room, which had been a thousand things for a thousand people, joined him in that fold between sound and being that London is better at than it admits. He did Sam and it tasted different now, like food you eat after the storm. He did the auntie song and the man at the back who never sings sang. He did one he had not planned, because Kian had asked, a thing about buses and corridors and breath, half-written in his notebook between an electricity bill and a list of physio appointments, and when he got to the line he had not written down but had carried instead—We sing so the day can hear us arrive—the room did a thing he had not expected of it; it went quiet not like a silence but like a prayer, which is to say, it took its hat off and made space.

After, the room rose, not like a stadium, not like a church, but like a kitchen where someone has brought news that will make dinner taste better. He stood for a second longer than was polite and then stood less and then stepped back to let the next person climb onto the tiny square of permission with their own mouth. He went outside and the air did not take his heat away immediately; it let him keep it a moment. He looked at the arch and it was not an arch; it was the rib of a thing he could not see, holding up nothing and everything, the way breath does, even when you think you don’t deserve it. He went home and opened the door and the building breathed and behind it his mother and his not-father and his brother and his city and his job and his numbers and his vowel-shaped future all made their noises in the rooms and he thought, the thing is happening, and then he boiled the kettle because life is only ever going to be this grand and this domestic at the same time.Chapter eight began with a silence that tried to pretend it was ordinary. The morning after the Last Box, the city put itself on as usual, a quick zip, a tug at sleeves, buses clearing throats at the curb. Ari woke to the specific weight of a day that no longer had a place in it he could go at eight and sing into brick. He lay and listened to the flat make breakfast noises without him: his mother taking lids off things that did not need lids, Gareth moving chairs the way men declare sovereignty, the kettle giving its reliable sermon. He had dreamed a door that opened onto a staircase that opened onto another door that opened onto a field that was actually carpet, and woke with the feeling of having remembered something that did not exist. He got up, washed his face, and found his voice doing that shy thing where it waited at the back until he asked nicely. He hummed one scale under his breath, the smallest of small revolutions, and it came, obedient as a cat pretending it didn’t care.

He walked past the Cinder Box on his way to the bus because grief, even for places, sometimes needs to be counted with steps. The chalkboard that had been a manifesto was now a black square, unhelpful. The windows had taken on that immediate absence gloss, like eyes after crying. Inside, shapes had been shifted just enough to be insulting. Fairy lights were down and coiled on a table; Nadia was on a ladder wrestling with a banner that refused to understand it was no longer a fact; Ayo stood on the little stage unscrewing a clamp with that care reserved for weapons or instruments. Kian leaned against the bar pretending to be nothing, a stance he had perfected.

“You’re early,” Nadia called, which was her way of saying thank you for coming to the funeral after the funeral. “Help me make this sign go quietly.”

Ari held one end and she unpinned the other with the pin in her hair and then put the pin back in her hair like a woman who refuses to end the show. “We’ll find a room,” she said, matter-of-fact, as if rooms were birds that could be coaxed onto the hand. “There are rooms in this city that have forgotten what they’re for. We’ll remind them.”

Ayo came down off the stage with a small screwdriver like a surgeon after a successful operation. “There’s a church hall near Dollis Hill,” he said. “It’s got a weird smell but good corners. The vicar owes me because I played a harvest festival where the mic didn’t work and I smiled anyway.”

Kian made a face. “I’ve got the underpass at Kilburn,” he said. “It’s avant-garde. The acoustics favour men who have wronged their girlfriends.”

They laughed, and Ari felt the laugh ease some hinge in him. He picked up a coil of cable and wrapped it the way Ayo had taught him, around the elbow, not twisting, respectful. He took down a poster with his own name on it and folded it into his pocket too carefully for rubbish. The room had that bleak relief of places that have survived the worst part of leaving. They stood at the door before they locked it and sang one line each, a broken garland: Nadia did a bar of a disco chorus that made the dust consider dancing; Ayo put a chord under it without thinking; Kian murmured the beginning of something he’d written on a bus; Ari added a vowel that had nowhere to be, and the four lines crossed exactly once like birds migrating, then carried on.

In the office, life had the gall to go on being numeric. The firm sent an email about a restructure that used calming blues and verbs that pretended to be pillows. Anita sat on the edge of his desk with her lunch like she wasn’t hungry but wanted to be ready. “If they move payroll to the back office in Slough,” she said, “you’ll have to come to Slough to teach them not to be tragic and I will have to learn how to drive a car that is always on the A4.”

“They won’t,” he said, because he had learned the use of a sentence delivered with a stable voice, and she nodded as if he had access to a power she didn’t, and went to microwave her soup with righteous purpose. Mr. Harcourt called an all-hands that lasted exactly as long as it took him to say the word lean twice and the word family not at all. He asked Ari, after, to present at a breakfast for small businesses on the topic of “Cash Flow Behaviours,” a title that sounded like a lion tamer’s memoir. “You have a way of making our advice sound like advice rather than doom,” Harcourt added, in a tone that could be mistaken for affection if you squinted. Ari said yes because bread and boundaries, because he liked the way people looked when a thing that troubled them became a thing they could do.

After work, he walked Lewis to the physio like a man walking a racehorse to the paddock, both of them dignified and faintly ridiculous. Lewis had traded the cast for a brace that made him look like he’d been outfitted by a cautious superhero. Maya greeted them in trainers that had seen more action than the average promise. “We graduate today,” she said, pencil at the ready. “Ankle alphabet. Spell your name, then spell something you don’t know how to win.”

Lewis rolled his eyes but he did it, calf trembling, face set toward somewhere he refused to ask the way to. “This is insulting,” he announced, halfway through the letter R. “My foot knows how to be a foot. It does not need to go to school.”

“Your ego knows how to be a foot,” Maya said, which was the kind of sentence that made Ari want to take notes. “Your foot needs instruction. Up, down, round. Breathe. Don’t make the breath a ceremony. It’s a tool.”

After, in the hospital café that spilt sugar like it was a currency, Ari bought them tea because he had overheard an argument at the till and felt obliged to balance the room. Lewis lifted his cup with both hands the way the newly humbled do. “The lads were on about Saturday,” he said. “They went to McD’s after the match and I stayed home and ate lies. They sent pictures of chips and lies. Monty says the new winger’s a show-off, which is rich.”

“You’ll go watch,” Ari said. “Talk nonsense from the touchline. It counts.”

“Maybe,” Lewis said, trying on the word for size and finding it almost wearable. “You doing your radio thing?”

“What radio thing,” Ari said, failing to sound nonchalant in a way that made Lewis grin.

“The one Nadia messaged you about at three in the morning, you melon,” Lewis said. “She put it in the family chat because your phone hates you. Some bloke called Teilhard or Telford wants you on that late show on Radio London where people phone in to confess to lentils.”

Ari checked his phone. The message had indeed slid past him in the soup of the day. Nadia: Got you five minutes on West End Late. You and Ayo. Talk about losing a room and finding another. Sing one line if the man is brave. He felt his ribs widen before he told them to. He felt a prickle at the back of his neck that was not fear and not joy but something that wanted a seat.

That evening he walked home through a bit of dusk that had decided to be kind. The corner shop had jalebis that looked like questions. He bought three and took them home in a paper bag that tried to be serious. Meera was in the kitchen peeling the skin off ginger with a spoon like a surgeon. “Your aunt called,” she said, casual failing very slightly to cover blood. “Sunita. Leicester. She saw the video on the WhatsApp”—she said the WhatsApp like it was a district—“your cousin Rishi is now my favourite nephew because he sends things. She says if you come up we will feed you like you are worth saving.”

Ari leaned on the doorframe, a posture he had inherited from people who needed frames. He had not imagined the tape would knock on the door; he had imagined it would sit in a drawer like a relic. “When?”

“She said Sunday next,” Meera replied, stirring turmeric into a pan as if the answer lay in colour. “She has a spare room that used to be your Uncle Dilip’s when they fell out and then fell in. We will go and not pretend we are not nervous. Gareth is suspicious of Leicester but he will not tell you that because he is being brave.”

Gareth put his head in, wiped his hands on a tea towel as if he needed the prop. “I’ll drive,” he said, which in his book outranked any poem. “You’re not going to put your mother on a train with a bag and a boy with a brace. We will arrive with aplomb. I will complain about the M1 and then I will eat everything they hand me and say it’s not as good as Meera’s and then I will apologise and ask for seconds.”

The week was a temporary bridge. Ari did numbers in the morning and breathing in the evening and occasionally both at once. He practised for the radio in his kitchen, not the singing—he had accepted he would sing exactly one line and that line would be chosen by someone else—but the talking. He tried to say Cinder Box without making it sound like a plea. He wrote down memory in bullet points and then refused to read them because he did not want to be a man who turned himself into a brochure. Ayo sent him voice notes with chords in them and the sound of a bus going past. Nadia sent him a recording of the host exaggerating vowels the way men do when they have a city to flatter. Ola sent him: breathe like the phone is a person who is frightened of you and needs to be persuaded to stay.

When Sunday came, the sky peeled back to show motorway. Gareth drove like a man who had inherited a map, a steady sixty-nine with a conspiracy of indicators. Meera had made bhajias for the journey in a Tupperware that had seen the inner life of six picnics and a funeral. Lewis lay lengthways across the back seat with his leg propped on a pillow and ate with the voracious guilt of a convalescent. The car had the sound of people who have agreed to be quiet and then decided not to. Ari watched the green roll by in strips and tried to decide if he was going to Leicester to meet a story or to dismantle one. He sang one line under his breath to the M1 and the M1 did not object.

Leicester smelled like family. Sunita’s house was red brick promisingly modest on a street that made all the same promises. She opened the door with the look of a woman who has no time for suspense. She folded Ari into her in a way that made him understand he had been missing something without knowing it. She kissed Meera’s cheeks with a ferocity that made Meera sudden and young. She shook Gareth’s hand and called him beta and then corrected herself and called him bhai and he tried both on and found he liked them. Rishi hovered in the hall wearing a T-shirt with a band on it that looked like a reasoning attempt. Somewhere in the house, a pressure cooker exhaled like a tired saint.

Sunita had his father’s eyes only in the exact sense that genetics occasionally politely insist on symmetry. “You are him in the mouth,” she said, and then made a pained face as if sorry the sentence had committed itself. “Not his trouble. His vowels. You came in like he used to come in when he had money and a joke. He had other ways of coming in too.”

They ate, because this house operated on the principle that nothing should be understood on an empty stomach. The food tasted like Meera’s childhood and Ari’s guesswork. After, Sunita put a hand on a cupboard door that had been opened so many times it knew what to do without being asked. She took out a shoebox with Bank of Baroda written on it in black marker and put it on the table with the reverence of people who keep holiness in practical containers. Inside were pictures that did not know they would be excavated, and a small notebook with a cheap cover that was half sunshine, half accounting ledger.

“This was his,” Sunita said, tapping the notebook. “He kept lists even when he didn’t. Songs. Pubs. Debts. People who laughed. People who didn’t laugh. He loved a list. He loved whatever was in front of him, which sounds like a virtue until you realise it makes nothing sacred. He went to Dubai and came back and went again and then the letters slowed and then the letters stopped. I have one with an oil stain that smells like petrol and hope. He sent a tape for you and Meera wouldn’t play it when he came round angry, and then when he went soft, she played it out of spite. Humans.”

Ari opened the notebook and the handwriting was a stranger’s trying to be legible. On one page, half a verse in Gujarati with the English translation underneath that got it wrong in a way that was briefly lovely; on another, a list of pub names that read like a poem of regret: The Two Brewers, The Volunteer, The Donkey, The King’s Head, The Star and Garter, The Bittersweet. There was a phone number with missing digits and a sketch of a tiger that would, if given a chance, look terrible on a shirt.

“Did he sing,” Ari asked, and Sunita laughed with flint in it.

“He sang like a man who thought the world owed him quiet,” she said. “He had a tone, you know, that lazy little sugar men like that have. You’ve got a spine he never had. Don’t be offended. It doesn’t make you better, it just makes you steadier. He didn’t have someone to say do the washing up now and don’t be a fool. He had my father saying come home. He had me saying stop charming and start making the rice. He didn’t know how to be a person unless someone was clapping. He’s probably dead.” She said it with a terrible kindness. “Or not. There are men who live a long time on one joke.”

Lewis shifted his leg carefully and said, in a boy’s blunt, “If I ever meet him I’ll say thanks for your chords and then I’ll take Ari home.” Sunita put a hand on his hair and smoothed it like she had been given permission by the gods. Meera sat with her eyes fixed on a place in middle distance women are given at birth. Gareth stood at the window with the look of a man guarding a perimeter he could not see.

After tea they went to the park because there are rules about being indoors too long. The grass did that English compromise with mud. A boy on a bait bike wheeled by with a grin that made the police in two counties suspicious. In a corner near a climbing frame, someone was doing handstands for the benefit of a girl who was ignoring them entirely. Ari sat with Sunita on a bench that had accepted many confidences. “You had to have music,” she said, in the tone of a person delivering an obvious fact. “Else you’d have grown sharp and mean. It comes out somewhere. Better the mouth. No offence to the fists.”

“I put it in spreadsheets for a bit,” he said. “Spreadsheets don’t clap. They don’t boo either.”

“You’ll bring your mum up again,” she said, not a question. “You’ll call me on Thursdays when the food shops get their aubergines in. You’ll send me that video of you doing the auntie song so I can frighten Rishi’s girlfriend. You’ll do both things. You can do both things. Don’t get funny about it and decide you have to be all one thing or another just to make other people more comfortable. You weren’t raised for other people’s comfort.”

On the drive back, Leicester shrank in the rearview mirror without losing anything. They took the slow lane for a while because the fast one was full of men who were making points. Lewis fell asleep with his mouth open, that vulnerable theatre of boys who pretend they hate naps. Meera sat with the shoebox on her lap like a pilgrim with a relic. Gareth drove the way you do when the car is carrying something breakable, as if this day were a pane of glass he refused to let potholes bully. Ari thought about his father’s list—the pubs like punctuation, the tiger drawn with false confidence, the half-translation that got the word for longing wrong and somehow, bizarrely, right. He did not feel compelled toward a search. He felt, instead, the odd satisfaction of owning a small, flawed piece of a bigger, flawed person and not having to tell it what to do.

The radio show happened at 11:05 p.m., which is a time that looks bigger on a clock than it feels in the throat. Ayo met him outside Broadcasting House with two coffees and a grin that made the architecture more bearable. The security guard took their names like it was an old story. The producer who came to collect them had dyed black hair and a patience you only learn on jobs that require convincing strangers to speak into machines. “We’re doing the modern masculinity hour,” she said, as if these words were an everyday weather. “Men, noise, politeness. Be yourself and if yourself swears, we have a button.”

In the studio, the host was a man with a voice that made you want to tell the truth even if it was none of his business. He shook their hands as if he was thanking them for having them. The red light came on and Ari felt his jaw relax the way it does when you’ve decided not to pretend. They talked about the Cinder Box without mourning it to death. They talked about rooms. Ayo said a thing about wood vibrating that made listeners in their kitchens put hands on tables. The host asked Ari when he knew he could sing and Ari chose a smaller answer so it would fit. “When I found out I didn’t have to be loud to be heard,” he said, and the host hummed a little noise that meant yes.

“Give us a line,” the host asked later, breaking his own rule because that is what men with good voices do when they want more. Ayo lifted a hand a centimeter and Ari landed on it. He sang two bars of the auntie song because no one could own it and two bars of the Sam because he was in a building that liked English and then stopped the way you stop when the taste is right. The producer’s face did that private gleam. The phone lines blinked and a woman from Croydon said her ex-husband had sung that Sam Cooke the night before their wedding and she had forgiven it and him and they were, ridiculously, friends now. A man from Neasden called to say he had done his first physio after a knee replacement and the part where the breath didn’t hurt was because someone on the radio had told him to pretend the air was not judging him. The host smiled at them like someone had let him be part of something instead of the witness, and Ari realised he had been wrong about radio; it wasn’t about talking to a room that wasn’t there. It was about talking to a thousand kitchens as if you’d nudged a door with your toe and been allowed to enter.

After, they went into the kind of night that makes the city look as if it has been boiled down to its essence. Kian, who had come up and sat on the stairs eating crisps during the show because stairs were his habitat and crisps his sacrament, joined them, his grin a pale moon. “You sounded like a confession that remembered to laugh,” he said, which is not a thing people usually say, and yet.

On Tuesday, as if to honour radio’s magic with an indignity, Kian texted a picture of a yellow notice slapped on his guitar case: £100 fine for obstructing yadda yadda and playing without an authorised permit. He sent another of his own face giving the sign the look people give weather when it misbehaves. Ari Googled busking in Brent with the intensity of a man trying to save a cat from bureaucracy. He discovered forms that had been designed to discourage art at twelve separate stages. He made a list. He filled Kian’s details in where Kian would have put jokes. He called a number and held for eight minutes listening to a fluting tune that sounded like a flute wishing to die and then a woman said, “Enforcement,” as if she had been interrupted mid-epiphany. He explained in the voice he used for tax offices and egos. He said the words community and regulation and safety and then he said the words discretion and mistake and first offence. He set an appointment with a man called Clive in a room near the Stadium where consent was issued like ration cards and he went with Kian to sit on plastic chairs watching laminated posters as if it were the theatre.

Clive turned out to be a person and not an instrument of deity, which was encouraging. He looked at Kian’s hat and decided to forego patronising him. He looked at Ari’s spreadsheet of times and places and decibels and decided to be charmed. He reduced the fine to a lecture and a permit fee that could be paid in instalments if Kian promised to learn when the Oxford Street traders have their day off. “Don’t be a nuisance,” Clive said at the end, and Kian nodded as if receiving sacred instruction. Outside, Kian hugged Ari with the desperate economy of men who hate to be seen needing anything. “You saved my week,” he said. “I was going to spend it entertaining bailiffs.”

The Community Arts Centre, nimble and stubborn, decided to hold an open day that was part celebration, part trap for councillors. Ola orchestrated it with the authority of a woman who had done weddings in fields and saved a rehearsal room from damp with a hairdryer. “We will teach them how to clap in time,” she said. “And then we will tell them to fund clapping.” The noticeboard bowed under the weight of flyers. Maya volunteered to run a session called Breath and Body for People Who Think They Hate Stretching. Nadia, temporarily roomless, ran a panel in a circle of chairs about the economics of listening which was slightly deranged and absolutely necessary. Ayo taught teenage boys who were worried that guitars might bruise their masculinity to tune by ear and win bets later. Kian took a room with a carpet that smelled faintly of sugar and showed kids how to sing into a wall and hear themselves be large without scaring their throats.

Ari, who had no talent for pretending not to be organising something even when he wasn’t, was handed a group labelled Beginners and Unapologetic. The circle was a mess of ages and reasons. There was a man whose wife had died last year and who had been told by a friend to “get out,” as if grief were a car; there was a girl with a shaved head and a cardigan and the kind of gaze that hurts you if you don’t respect it; there was a grandmother with a handbag that could house a bird; there was a boy who had come because his mother had told him to and who spent the first ten minutes sulking and the next ten daring himself to need it. Ari made them do the ridiculous lip trills and the vowel slides and then he made them sing “Lean On Me” which is the kind of song that can be an insult if you use it wrong and a medicine if you don’t. They did not sing it beautifully. They sang it in a way that made the room sturdier. He watched the woman from the council with sensible shoes at the back and saw her shoulders drop half an inch and knew that half an inch pays bills.

After the open day the councillor came up to Ola and said the words if and possibility and engagement and Ola nodded as if she were accepting tribute and then turned to Ari and said, “We are not safe but we are safer, and nobody safe ever made a noise worth hearing.” He found himself laughing and tired and the kind of hungry you get when work has been blessed. He walked home with a hand on the notebook in his pocket like it was a talisman.

The audition came in the form of a message from Ola that read, in its entirety: wear black, bring water, London Community Chorus is choosing men who can count. He went to a rehearsal room behind a theatre that smelled like twenty years of ambition and dust. The music director had a fringe that could count down in 5/4. There were twenty-five men in various stages of nerves. They stood on risers and sight-read a medley of songs that had no business being together and yet did, because budgets and optimism. Ari found the line where his voice could fit without disappearing. He counted other men in with his eyebrow. He did not try to teach anybody anything. After, the director called numbers and stopped at his and said, “Third row, left, don’t swan,” and he laughed because it had been a long time since someone had assumed he might swan.

He met a woman there called Tash who had a laugh like a chalk line and a pair of boots that had seen activism. She stood in the alto section with the unflappable air of someone who can tune any room with an eyeroll. “That bit where you almost swallowed the E vowel and then reconsidered,” she said after, apropos of nothing, “that was the smartest thing anyone did tonight.” He thanked her and then failed to say a second sentence because this was not his arena. She rescued him. “We go to the pub after this,” she said. “We drink half pints and complain about the difference between ‘stage black’ and black. Join us. Or at least come and watch us prove our point about blend.”

Lewis walked without the crutch for five steps that evening and then sat down triumphantly as if he had run a training montage. Gareth recorded it like a documentary and sent it to the family chat with fourteen bicep emojis, which is the working-class emoji for love. Meera put sandalwood paste on the doorframe and apologized to it for past neglect. Ari stood with a hand on the back of the chair and felt his insides go warm as if someone had put a lamp there.

That night, when the house had rolled itself up and tucked the day in, Ari put the tape in the machine again, and then the notebook next to it, and sang one of the half-written songs on the page into the air as if he were offering it back to where it had come from. He kept the vowels the way the page wanted and allowed his mouth to be a cousin of a stranger’s. He could feel his own voice disagree and then agree in a way that felt less like betrayal than like a handshake across time. He did not make a decision about fathers; decisions about fathers are jokes the universe plays on children. He decided about breath, though. He decided that in rooms with public carpet and in rooms with private windows he would do the thing that turned noise into use.

The letter arrived on a Thursday that had already completed a surprising amount of admin by nine. It was from the council again, but this time the envelope had that reassuring cheapness government uses when it wants you to think it is not about to disappoint you. He opened it with a butter knife because if you use knives for their intended purposes all day you forget they can do other things. The words were sharper than the paper. Interim funding extended, a pilot programme for off-peak free rehearsal space, a catchment redefinition that meant the centre could claim people who had previously thought it wasn’t theirs. Ola sent an emoji of a pigeon with a crown. Nadia sent three flame emojis and a picture of a basement with mould captioned This will be music by October. Ayo sent a voice note of his guitar playing two notes that sounded like a door opening and closing. Kian sent a selfie from the underpass with his new permit tucked in his hat. Anita, not to be outdone, sent a photo of Brenda trying to clap on the two and the four.

On Saturday, as agreed and feared, Ari joined the chorus in a church off the Strand to back two stars in a fundraiser. He stood on the third row left and did not swan. He watched Tash roll her eyes and fix intonation without moving a muscle below the nose. He watched the audience think their money could buy them that feeling and he did not resent them. He watched the way hundreds of voices denied the city’s emptiness and made it a bowl instead. He sang words he’d never say in conversation and meant them. He texted Ayo a line from the hymn because that’s the kind of blasphemy they’d agreed on.

On the way home the bus was full of people who had chosen to be out instead of in. He stood by the bend and rocked with the city. He heard a ringtone that used to be a song and then remembered the song. He got off two stops early to walk under the arch because the arch had become the wrong thing to love and he loved it anyway. He hummed a phrase into the underpass and got it back fat and true and felt the ridiculous relief that comes when you are still in the same city you woke up in. At home the building breathed. He put the kettled on. He practised counting gratitude in four and then in seven, because there was more of it lately than felt content with common time. He ate toast. He sat at the table and wrote a list of places that would have him and people he needed to thank and things that could pay for physio not covered by the delicate kindness of strangers. He wrote: Spin & Spine, Auntie group, Dollis Hill hall, radio again? He wrote: call Sunita about the aubergines. He wrote: practice not being frightened of joy in public. He underlined the last one because joy in public had a way of picking a fight with whatever you had organised for yourself.

Around midnight, when you can hear the foxes discussing politics, there was a knock at the door that did not belong to people who know you. It was not urgent, but it was not polite. Gareth did the slow walk down the hallway that doubles as warning and welcome. Ari followed because that is what you do when there are knocks. On the other side of the wood was a man slightly older than Ari with a face that had been sitting in the rain and decided against it. He had a card in his hand he wasn’t offering yet and a stance that suggested he had practised saying difficult things in other doorways. “Sorry,” the man said, in a voice that made the apology not cheap. “I’m looking for Arjun Patel. I’ve got something that might belong to him. Or to someone who made him. We found it in a storage unit in Alperton that’s due to be emptied. The name on it is Patel, and a tape with a tiger.” He looked mis-shelved and sorry. “Are you that Patel?” he asked, and Ari, who was both and sometimes neither, said yes because saying no has never stopped a thing from arriving.Chapter ten began with the kind of knock that insists on surviving the conversation it starts. The man on the threshold had the posture of somebody playing courier in the story of other people’s lives. He held his card as if it were proof he didn’t come to sell anything belonging to God. The card said his name was Martin and underneath it, in smaller letters, Clearance and Storage Solutions, which sounded like therapy for objects. His jacket smelt faintly of rain and rubber mats. Up close, his eyes were the colour of patience.

“Alperton,” he said, as if he were introducing a character. “We’ve got a unit comes up when we run the ledger. Overdue three months. Name on the booking is Patel. No first name, but the list inside—there’s a tape with a tiger on it. The lad down there heard your name on the radio. He put two and two together and I told him not to do maths with people’s lives, and then I thought maybe I would come to the door and ask instead. We do an auction Monday if nobody shows. Thought I’d give you the weekend. If it isn’t yours, tell me to go away and I’ll be gone before your kettle boils.”

Meera appeared behind Gareth with the eerie quiet mothers have when they move without the house noticing. She didn’t say the name she had spent years not saying; she tightened her shawl and looked at the card like it might melt in her hands. Gareth narrowed his eyes in that way he does when he’s testing a man for strength and decency, found both, and stepped aside without making it an approval scene.

“It’s ours,” Ari heard himself say, and immediately wondered at the generosity of that claim. He took the card with both hands like a delicate envelope. “We’ll come in the morning,” he added, to the man, to the room, to his own breath, which had risen as if it had been called on stage when it wanted a seat.

Alperton the next day was an alphabet of orange doors in an industrial estate that had lost a bet with design. The corridors held that tinny echo you get when a place was built to be forgotten quickly. The storage manager had a moustache that remembered other moustaches. He ran them through the rules with a tired kindness. “No smoking, no lingering, no filming for telly,” he said, as if that had been attempted, perhaps successfully, last month. “Unit thirty-seven. You’re all right to take things today if you settle the arrears at the desk. Not much. Coffee money compared to some. My name’s Hitesh. My wife thinks I live here. She isn’t wrong.”

Lewis insisted on coming, brace and all, on the principle that if your family is about to open a box that might rearrange the room, you don’t sit at home and watch a programme about antiques. He clumped down the corridor with that careful swagger of men negotiating dignity with plastic. Meera held her handbag armoured tight. Gareth walked with his hands ready for lifting, which had always been one of the ways he said I am here.

The padlock on thirty-seven was the small stubborn kind. Martin produced a bolt cutter like a magician resigned to his own trick. “I could make a ceremony,” he said, already cutting, “but there’s no sense in pretending the past listens to process.” The lock gave with a sigh that sounded like relief or exhaustion. They rolled the door up and the smell that came out was dust and old paper and a hint of something sweet, like stale jalebi—regret with sugar.

Inside, the unit was an unkind archive. Plastic crates with their lids half on, a battered harmonium with a cracked reed peering like a broken tooth, a milk crate full of cassette tapes labeled in three different hands—Gujarati, English, and the universal script of men writing in a hurry. A cheap PA speaker with gaffer tape wounds. A mic stand that had been upright too long. A suitcase with a sticker that said Dubai in a font that believed in the nineties. A cardboard poster rolled on itself like a sunburnt map. In one corner, a pair of shoes with a good heel and dirt caked on them from a city that wasn’t this one.

Meera stood very still for a second and then moved in with a swift, ruthless tenderness. She touched objects the way you touch a sleeping dog you don’t trust and then the way you touch a child you do. She ran a finger along the harmonium and then wiped the dust on her shawl without wincing. Gareth picked up the PA with the economy of a man who can tell by the weight whether it’s worth mending. Lewis sat on an upturned crate like a king in exile and used one hand to open another, because independence was a muscle that needed showing off.

Ari lifted the lid on the cassette crate. The top one was a TDK with a tiger sticker on it, peeling at one corner, the same amateur tiger his aunt had laughed at in Leicester, the same tiger that had invaded a shirt and a memory. Underneath, more: “Bittersweet – Thurs – set 2,” “Nani’s bhajans,” “AJP Demo,” “Airport Nights,” “Sam C?” scrawled with the arrogance of men who expect to recognise their own shorthand forever. On the back of one, in careful Gujarati, “Arjun sings, age 4,” and Ari had to sit down, not because his legs had given up but because his breath had rushed in fast and then, obedient to instruction, slowed.

The rolled poster had a rubber band that snapped like a decision when he took it off. It unfurled itself into an advert for The Bittersweet, Salusbury Road, Thursday Open Mic, Special Guest This Week: RJ “Tiger” Patel. The photograph was a man’s smile made of sugar and nerve. There is a way a mouth can be your inheritance whether you signed for it or not. Ari found the line of it in his own face and then put the poster down gently because he didn’t trust himself to be fair.

“What’s the damage?” Gareth asked, practical because somebody had to count while the rest of them stood inside the storm. Hitesh named a number that would not bankrupt their month and would slightly bruise it. Ari handed his card over at the desk as if paying for a bus he’d been waiting for since before he’d learned to run. Hitesh tapped the till, then added, almost offhand, “I listened to your radio the other night. My daughter had it on. You said something about breath not being a ceremony. I liked that. If anyone complains you took more than is reasonable from this unit, tell them I told you to take it. Sometimes the reasonable thing is a theft.”

They loaded the car and a borrowed trolley and the borrowed strength of one another. A man with a forklift watched them with the ready empathy of people whose work is moving other people’s weight. Back at the flat the objects refused to line up and be understood. They lay on the floor and made a new map of the living room. Meera wiped each cassette as if excusing it. The tape deck from the unit came alive reluctantly, whirring and clicking like an old auntie getting herself down into a chair with both dignity and commentary.

They put in the tiger tape and listened to its beginning twice because the first time they were not ready. The sound of a room, first, that unmistakable pub hum that exists in every language: glasses arguing about whether to clink, chairs objecting to the shape of themselves, a voice at the bar doing a joke that should not have survived its birth. Then a scrape, the marvel of a cheap mic settling into its duty, and then a breath taken by a man who believed that breath owed him something. He sang “Bring It On Home to Me” like a dare and a promise, lazy sugar exactly as Sunita had warned, a wobble on a word that would in another man be the beginning of charm and in him might have been the beginning of trouble. He had a softness that wanted to be forgiven in advance. He had a way of turning vowels into invitations. He had her name in his mouth sometimes without saying it. He stopped halfway through a line to say, “Again,” and laughed like he’d tripped and expected the floor to apologise.

Meera stood with her hand over her eyes, fingers splayed, looking and not looking, a woman who had learned how to absorb noise without letting it rearrange her furniture. Gareth leaned back against the kitchen doorframe with the set of a man who has learned to stand between the past and the sink. Lewis listened like he listens to commentary—sceptical, fixated, halfway to a fight with a silhouette. Ari listened like you listen when a story grows a new chapter in your pocket against your will. He could hear the ways in which he was not this man. He could hear the ways in which he would never escape his mouth.

“Put the next,” Meera said, when the applause on the tape was done being polite. The next was quieter. A bhajan in a room that wasn’t a pub, reedy harmonium wheezing old kinship, a child’s voice on top of a man’s like a sparrow perched on a line, a woman somewhere in the middle humming with the kind of tune that housekeeping teaches you. The child did his vowels like a boy building a bridge with his breath. The man was showier than the hymn wanted. He couldn’t help himself. Meera made a sound like a kettle not boiling yet and then sat down because sitting is the only answer sometimes.

After a while Ari took the tape out and put the lid on the deck as if it were a sleepy thing. He wanted to let the past get some air before he asked it for more. They divided the contents of the unit without saying the words divide or contents. Meera took the harmonium because it would know where to sit in her kitchen without knocking elbows. Gareth took the PA down to the community centre with the affectionate scorn of a man who will coerce life out of old electrics if only to win a fight with entropy. Lewis put the Bittersweet poster on his wall despite himself, because there are some jokes even pride can’t resist. Ari took the notebooks, the cassettes, the broken mic stand that had a surprisingly sturdy base. He took the suitcase with the sticker because something inside it made a tiny sound like a laugh.

Inside the suitcase were shirts that had lost their argument with style and a plastic wallet of papers that made paper into a biography—airport access cards, a payslip from a night shift that called him Anthony because the payroll software was in a mood, a letter from Sunita dated 2003 asking him to stop taking money from their mother and start bringing onions, a receipt from a pub where somebody had scrawled on the back “Tues, DJ says you can close. Don’t be late. Don’t be you.” Tucked at the bottom, folded into weariness, a photograph of Meera with a sari the colour of late afternoon, laughing at someone off-camera, holding a baby whose eyebrows were a prophecy. Ari held the photo and did not ask anyone to explain it.

There was also, surprising him by the weight of its silence, a cassette with the word Sorry on it in Gujarati. He put it aside like a bowl too hot to pick up, then picked it up because curiosity is often pain in a velvet coat. He waited until the flat had done what flats do—plates put away, television murmuring, the small tired rituals of British evenings. He waited until he could be alone and then could not bear to be and called Ayo anyway.

Ayo came with his hat and an expression like late-night competence. He sat with him on the floor among cassettes, a kind of awards ceremony for stubborn plastic. They put the Sorry tape in. The click, the whir, the clearing of a throat that had not learned to apologise properly. The voice of a man speaking Gujarati that had been simplified for a household where English had moved in. He said Meera’s name like he had tried it on without earning the right to it. He said “beta” and the tape warbled as if the word had weight. He said, “I can’t come today,” and “I am trying,” and “Listen, I paid Hitesh at the unit,” and “Tell him I will come Saturday.” He said, “I am not a bad man,” with a conviction that made the sentence a bit ridiculous. He said, “I sang in a church yesterday and God did not throw me out,” and “You shouldn’t laugh at me, Meera,” and, finally, soft, “Arjun, you sang louder than me. That’s good. Be louder,” and then the tape ended as if it had been interrupted by a kettle and never resumed.

Ari rewound and listened again not because he thought the words would change but because he had altered slightly and wanted to see if the listening would too. He didn’t feel forgiveness arrive like a parcel. He didn’t feel rage the way some people want you to perform it, as a service to narrative. He felt an old house become a new house without being demolished. Ayo put a hand on his shoulder and left it there for a minute, which is often more useful than opinions.

“Come to the hall Friday,” Nadia texted the next morning, as if the sentimental archaeology of the weekend had been an admin task, ticked. “Dollis Hill. We’re christening it. Bring the sad songs and the happy ones and your ridiculous mic stand. Bring your mother if she’ll come. Bring anyone who’ll clap in time or try.”

Meera, when asked, raised an eyebrow and negotiated tea into the deal without speaking. Gareth both grumbled and polished his shoes, a combination so familiar it only counts as love. Lewis announced he might stand at the back and make faces at the harmonies and then asked if there would be samosas, which is the male negotiating position between apathy and hope.

The Dollis Hill church hall had the smell of underheated optimism and the acoustics of a place that had always wanted to be used for something better than meetings. Nadia had strung a line of lights that took the edge off the fluorescent honesty. She had a clipboard that bore the scars of a good life. The vicar had put out chairs in nervous rows. Ayo tuned in the corner, hat at a pensive angle. Kian had a permit stuck in his pocket that he flashed at anyone who pretended not to be interested. Ola was there with a plastic container of cut fruit and the eyes of someone who had fought something invisible earlier and won.

The room filled the way rooms do in London when they have not yet earned the right to be loved—suspiciously, generously, with coats. Aunties came because they had been promised a place to be loud without apology. Boys came because they had been told there would be something to lean on. Girls came because the city had told them a hundred times their noise was an inconvenience and they wanted to inconvenience a room on purpose. The first act was nervous and charming and sang a song about baking bread that made a man in the second row cry as if gluten had done him wrong. The second act was angry in six-eight and demanded the rent write back.

Ari stood side-stage—a fairy lights pretence of an actual stage—with his ridiculous mic stand that suddenly looked like an ancestor among other ridiculous stands. He had brought the harmonium, because Meera had insisted and because it had sulked in the corner of her kitchen like it was jealous of kettles. He had Ayo’s guitar. He had a set list that was mostly a suggestion. When Nadia nodded at him with that combination of affection and menace she has perfected, he stepped forward and decided not to address the room as an enemy to be conquered or a friend to be milked. He greeted it like a bus you’ve decided to forgive for being late, because it is our nature to forgive buses.

He began with the thing he could do in his sleep now and chose not to sleep through: the Sam Cooke, spare and owned and yours without being stolen. He watched the room take its first step toward him and he took one back to meet it in the middle. He moved into the auntie song with the harmonium sighing its old sigh and a small choir of ladies in the third row assuming, correctly, that they were permitted to run away with it. He let them and then came in under, the way Ayo had wanted him to learn so badly—join, don’t compete, your breath is not a weapon.

And then he did something he had not warned anyone about. He put the harmonium aside and asked the room if it minded if he learned a new song in front of them. The noise they made was the noise of London when it pretends to be blasé so it can be kind without losing face. He told them, not the story, not the politics of storage or forgiveness, but the factual boredom of boxes and cassettes and a tiger with a bad face. He said he had found a melody with not enough words yet. He said some of the words were not his. He said he would try not to waste their time. He put his hands by his sides the way Ola had made him, like a promise to his own lungs.

He sang the tune from the “Sorry” tape without the sorry. He had changed the way three notes fell so that they landed on his tongue rather than the man’s who had left a room before he was finished living in it. He kept one lazy sugar turn because he was allowed to keep sweets if he promised to eat dinner. He put a Gujarati line from the notebook where his father had got the translation wrong and put it wrong on purpose, the same wrong, because wrong sometimes is how family is measured. He put English under it because English pays rent in this city and should do some other work. Ayo found the chord not yet invented and put it under like a plank over wet grass. The room breathed out in one piece.

Meera sat in the front, hands clasped, face an administrative miracle. She did not cry because she had done that at the kitchen sink for soapier reasons. Gareth made the sound men make when they are proud and wish to disguise it as discomfort. Lewis stood at the back, foot propped, grin doing violent overtime. Ola tilted her head at the bar where he was usually weak and he did not wobble. Nadia’s cap said NO on the front and PLEASE on the back and she turned it for the verses and for the chorus. Kian leaned against the wall counting beat with his jaw.

After, the room gave back what they had. A woman he didn’t know touched his arm in that older-woman way that can make you be ten and thirty at once. “We used to put our grief in our throats and spit it,” she said, in a Punjabi Ari’s ear had to run after. “You made it stay. Good. Not always, but sometimes.” A boy of twelve asked Ayo how much a guitar cost and if the price included the bit that makes your mum stop shouting. Someone from the council took Nadia’s hand too firmly and promised a meeting. A vicar stacked chairs with the calm of a man who had seen weddings go wrong and funerals get rowdy.

On the way home they walked along a bit of road that had decided to keep quiet for once. The Wembley arch did its faint ribcage act, permission to live lodged in structural engineering. Gareth carried the harmonium like a man doing penance and pretending it was a workout. Meera held the shoebox under one arm because that had been agreed now: Leicester would send the rest when ready and in return London would send jalebi and not too many opinions. Lewis held the Bittersweet poster rolled tight like a threat to a future wall. Ari walked with the tiger tape in his pocket and felt it warm from his body and from the notion that sometimes we inherit what we can use and leave the rest on the verge for other gods.

He slept badly because full hearts are rude. He woke to a message from Tash that said simply: that vowel on the second line was indecent; thank you, and a photo of a rehearsal schedule with his name on it printed properly for once. He woke to a message from Sunita that said, in her sun-dry voice, Send me that song, I will forgive it if it is good, and if it is bad I will forgive you because your mother made me promise. He woke to a message from Mr. Harcourt saying there had been a request for him to repeat his talk at the breakfast, “and the part about ‘graphs and emptiness’ that had the hair people nodding at their own reflections,” which he read twice because God puts jokes inside your inbox when you least expect it.

Later that week, in a room with neutral carpet and a bad clock, he called a number written on a scrap in the notebook, not because he wanted to but because his breath sat quietly until he did, and a man answered with the voice of a DJ who had retired and survived and was now fixing coffee machines for a living. “Tony,” the man said suspiciously, and then warmed when Ari said Bittersweet. Tony remembered everything, and nothing you’d want in a court, and enough for Ari to breathe in and out in a new shape. “Your old man,” Tony said, and the phrase didn’t make Ari flinch. “He sang like he’d been owed something. He knocked off his shift, came in with oil on his fingers, sometimes smelled like plane trolleys, sometimes smelled like bad news. Men like him, they can turn a room and they can break one. He did a bit of both. He used to get to the line and then leave it.” Tony paused, lighter catching not quite catching. “You turned the line last night,” he said, surprising Ari into laughter. “Nadia posted it. My daughter sent it to me because she thinks I’m failing at being modern. Don’t tell her I already saw. You sound like a man who knows where to put his hands.”

The week rolled on and did that thing where bravery gets bored and sits down, and you have to stand without it. Lewis tried his first jog, a foolish four steps that threatened to become a sprint and then sensibly became a stop. He lay on the grass and let the sky tell him obvious truths. “You’ll play again,” Ari said, not a promise, a companion sentence. “Or you won’t and you’ll do the other thing you were meant to do and it’ll be annoying because it will be great.” Lewis threw grass at him with his left hand and then sat up because he hated lying down in public when people weren’t being paid to watch.

Ari stood at a photocopier and did lip trills under the bellow of a machine. Anita put a cup of tea on his desk and a note that read: Brenda says your song at the field day was too “sincere”. I told her sincerity is a public health measure. He sent Nadia a photo of the ridiculous mic stand repaired with Gareth’s tape and she sent back a picture of a room with damp and hope and the caption: ours for Thursdays, bring chairs.

At night he put a blank page next to the notebook with the errors he loved. He wrote a line shaped like the arch and one shaped like a breath and one shaped like his mother’s rice and then crossed them all out because crossing out is also writing. He played the tiger tape low and tried to be fair. He took the “sorry” and put it somewhere it could not bite, and then he picked it up again because there is no point in domesticating snakes if you are not going to learn their names. He breathed in, out, wholly ungracefully, and thought, the storage of a life is the life. The boxes are only boxes until you carry them up the stairs. The unit is only a unit until you remember to sing inside it. He slept eventually. The city snored. The arch held up nothing and everything. The morning came with an unearned optimism and a bus that arrived on time and the unphotographable quiet joy of getting on it without thinking you might have to justify your seat.
