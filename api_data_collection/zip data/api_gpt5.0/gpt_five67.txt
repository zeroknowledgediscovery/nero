Marek heard the city breathing before he saw the river. Bratislava exhaled along the Danube in a fog that smelled faintly of malt and wet stone, and the trams ticked their blue tongues on the tracks, and pigeons shuffled like gossiping old men on the ledge outside his window. He sat in the frame of that window in his undershirt, bare feet on the radiator, a chipped enamel mug warming his hands. The mug had been a stranger once; he had found it in a box at a flea market near Miletičova, lidless, lip bent. He had put it between his palms, listened to the dull ache in its porcelain, and whispered its shape back into itself. The crack had drawn together like a memory closing.

He could do that. He could take what frayed, what broke, what fell into the wrong pile, and coax it toward wholeness. There were words for such work in old books—enchantment, restoration, repair—but Marek preferred the small humility of his own term. Suturing. He sutured the city from behind its seams so that the beautiful face of it, the café windows and the hush of yellow streets, never had to admit it had bled.

“Dobré ráno,” he said aloud to the empty kitchen, and the mug answered by not leaking.

His shop was on Kapucínska, under the castle’s shadow. If you didn’t know it, you would pass it. The sign was hand-carved, lettered in a script so modest it practically apologized for existing: Košík & Co. Repairs. The other word below had worn away under rain and sun until only its scent remained: Magic.

When he unlocked the grate that morning, the bells of St. Martin were still yawning off the hill. He pushed the grate up, shoulder working, and his left hand, the one with the crescent scar that either meant good luck or old foolishness depending on the hour, touched the wood of the door. He felt the grain greet him, the slow chorus of rings in the tree saying hello. He smiled. In the glass reflection he looked like a taller younger version of his father—long jaw, shoulders a bit too narrow for his coat, hair that would curl if given any encouragement. He didn’t give it any. The curled things in his life were inside objects, under glue, in memory.

The shop smelled of varnish and linen threads and the particular peppery note of dust that comes from old papers. On the back wall were cubbies filled with labeled jars: porcelain shavings, bronze filings, glass dust sorted by color—emerald in one, cobalt in another. Marek could lift the lid of the cobalt jar and hear the hum of everything those tiny particles had once been—wine bottles smashed in summers, blue apothecary jars from a pharmacist on Laurinská, a costume gem cheap as a lie. If you listened long enough, you could tell the difference. Not that many people listened. He did. That was his particular set of skills, as Pani Běla liked to tell him when she brought in something new to be rescued. He listened until the world forgot it had been broken.

Just then, the bell on the door jangled. It never rang like the same bell twice; the metal had moods. Sabina slipped in on a comma of cold air, cheeks pink. She wore a scarf striped like the tram lines and carried a canvas bag that had printed on it in three languages that the earth would not forgive us. Her hair was up in a knot that looked like a small, angry bun.

“You’re late,” he said, because he always said that, and because he loved to hear her answer.

“I’m on time in relative terms,” she said, unwinding her scarf until she was composed of elbows and energy. “Einstein would back me up. Also I brought rožky.”

He took the bag and peeked. “You may live another day.”

She hopped up to sit on the high stool behind the counter, swung her legs, made the stool squeak its disapproval. Sabina had been his apprentice for eight months. He still hadn’t decided whether she was going to be better at suturing than he was and whether that would make him very proud or a tiny bit salty. She was studying environmental science at Comenius and came in afternoons, mornings, whenever she could, on days when the river was low and the university seemed to her like a white hospital where time got set in jars and labeled.

“What do we have?” she asked, already tying her hair tighter. “Any drama?”

“Drama?” he repeated, opening his ledger. “This is a respectable establishment. The only drama here is whether Pán Karol’s cuckoo will learn to mind its cuckoo again. It has stages.”

“He cursed at it last time. The man cursed at a bird trapped in a clock.”

“This is a country of poets,” Marek said dryly, “and we are not above aiming our poetry at wood.”

Outside, a tram screamed a curve, and the scream fell to purr. The morning walked itself forward. People came, as they always did, with old things that hurt more than new things, with a teapot that had belonged to a mother who had said too many goodbyes, with a jewelry box that had jumbled the earrings of three sisters and then gone silent. Marek’s hands went their slow, unshowy dance. Sabina sanded, glued, filed, girdled a tiny crack with a thread of gold that would show when it was done. Not hidden. Shown. The old woman who picked it up cried just like a kettle sighing. “Ďakujem, chlapci,” she said, though Sabina made a face at chlapci. Boys. Marek winked. “Prosím.”

In between the bell’s comings and goings, Marek let himself listen to the city’s more private sounds. Down at the Danube, the gulls were mad at the river for being stingy with fish. Up on the hill, the castle was pretending it had always been there and did not remember the demolitions and rebuilds, the scaffolds, the way tourists touched the stone like an altar. Across the street, a man in a suit argued into his phone about contracts and then hung up and petted a dog so tenderly the phones apologized. The bins by the curb shivered. He glanced. The blue-lidded one, plastics and metal, had been moved. He could tell because the paint on the curb had one scuff where the wheel caught. It hadn’t been moved by wind. It had been moved by someone who believed that bins were suggestions.

“Sabina,” he said. “Do you see—”

“Hmm?” She had a magnifying lens in one eye like a pirate and was frowning at a hairline in porcelain.

“Never mind,” he said. “Nothing.” And that was true and not true. He did not like the way the blue bin sat. Like a chair pulled half out. Like a pause inserted for someone else’s breath.

At eleven, Pani Běla arrived. The doorbell did something like a metallic curtsy, and she came in with her back straight and her coat like a flag. She worked at the secondhand bookshop farther down the street, and her hair was a poem about clouds. She set on the counter a square wooden frame, its corners cracked, its glass intact, and tapped the glass with a nail. Back in 1989, in the winter, she had stood in a square with strangers and keys had rung. The photo inside the frame was of that square, the faces not quite clear, the hands up with keys that looked like singing insects. “My granddaughter wants this on her wall,” she said, not quite looking at it. “I told her it can’t hang, not like this.”

Marek lifted it. Usually frames were not about wood. They were about what the wood had dared to hold. He put his fingertips on the glass, and the glass remembered the heat of the photographer, the fog of a breath that had made a little oval on one patch as the picture had slid into place. The wood remembered a hammer too heavy for the nails it had been given. It had borne a small pain inside itself for thirty years. He said, softly: “You were brave.”

“Not brave,” she said. “Tired of being told to be quiet.”

He shook his head. “That is a form of bravery.”

Sabina reached to take it, gentle as someone handling a sleeping thing, and the photograph turned a fraction and settled. The frame sighed. Sometimes that happened, an object accepting its own weight. Sabina flushed, delighted, because he had taught her that feeling a sigh felt like taking a secret into your hands and not breaking it.

When Pani Běla had gone, and the bell had curtseyed and laughed, Sabina said, in a voice pitched low so that it could slip under Marek’s awareness like a thread under skin: “You’re hearing it, aren’t you?”

“Hearing what?”

“The bins,” she said. “The way the blue one slides and the green one sulks. The way the lids are never closed fully. The way someone keeps putting things in the wrong mouths.”

He gave her a look over the top of his reading glasses. “I hear many things,” he said. “Mostly you talking.”

“The city’s recycling schedule is a living document,” she said primly, and he smiled despite himself because she said schedule like scherzo.

“Someone new moved in around the corner,” he said, which was true, because the corner’s mood had changed. “They are not yet literate in the language of bins. We will give them time.”

“They also left a bag of chips on top of the yellow lid. Half-full. Like a bribe.”

“Then we will give them a pamphlet,” he said, “and a firm stare.”

She made a face. “You and your firm stare.”

It could have remained a day like that, the kind you only feel later when it’s dark and your hands are clean and you say to yourself, That was a good day, quiet as a dog by a fire. It might have. But the city shifts its mood like a cat deciding the spot is no longer warm enough. At two, a man in a municipal vest came in. His face had the color of someone who had spent years out in the weather, which is to say it had a lot of weather in it. He took off his hat and did not look like he was here for a broken handle.

“Pán Košík?” he said. His voice placed him from the east. “I’m Ondrej. From OLO.” He gestured vaguely toward Outside. Odvoz a Likvidácia Odpadu. They were the ones who came in the very early mornings and made the city forget it had had the impulse to rot.

Marek shook his hand. “Coffee?”

“No, thank you. I hear you’re good with—” He flapped fingers, as if he were trying to gesture without making a sign. “With—”

“Broken things,” Marek supplied.

“Strange things.” Ondrej looked at Sabina and then away and then back with the suspicion that youths might be better at strange than adults. “We have something at the Petržalka collection point. Not right. I thought, maybe, you’d look.”

“We?” Sabina said, brightening. She had not yet lost the belief that a day without a field trip was a day wasted.

Ondrej hesitated. “It would be better to go soon.”

“Now?” Marek asked.

“If possible.”

Marek glanced at his ledger. At the shelf with the cuckoo. At the frame drying. The bins along the street held their breath. “Sabina, put the sign.”

She flipped the little placard in the window from open to späť zanedlho—back soon—and stuck her arms into her coat, which was the color of mold if mold were fashionable. They followed Ondrej out into the gilt light that hangs on autumn afternoons like nostalgia and walked toward the bridge, past the facades that pretended they didn’t know when they were built, around a tourist photographing the sideways glare of the castle. They crossed the SNP most—the UFO’s green disc was an eye pretending to sleep—and the wind picked up the edges of Marek’s coat and looked for coins in his pockets.

“Here,” Ondrej said, when the ground turned from cobbles to asphalt to the brown of bare dirt. The collection point was a choreography of skips and bins and the long truck Bay where the compactor gaped its metal tongue. Marek could smell iron and a ghost of orange peel and the sharp breath of plastic, which smells like a dragon that has eaten a choir.

It was quiet in the wrong way. The crows were not speaking. The men in vests had gathered at a distance with the carefulness of people discussing someone else’s misfortune. Ondrej led them around the line of containers to a patch of concrete near the back fence where the shadow of a poplar tree kept still like a held thought. On the concrete lay a mosaic. No. Not something that had been made to be looked at. Something that had assembled itself in secret and then sat there waiting, not to be seen, but to be tripped.

Glass bottles, dozens of them, in a spiral. Green beer bottles, clear water bottles, a single blue that had once been an expensive vodka but had fallen from grace. Caps, too, arranged in arcs, the numbers on them turned away. The plastic bags had been braided into a cord. It had an ugliness that was meticulous. It had intention.

Sabina squatted, eyes wide. “Who did this?”

“Not us,” Ondrej said unnecessarily.

Marek crouched. The spiral was not a spiral. It had been designed to be looked at by someone above it, someone who understood how lines could be read like sentences if you took two steps to your left and tilted your head to the right. He tilted his head. He felt the small hairs rise along his right forearm. The bottles were humming in an almost-inaudible key. The caps held a tension, like kids with secrets in their mouths. He touched the thread of bags and felt the tug toward the center of the circle, where a ring of glass dust lay, blue and green and clear like ground-up dreams.

“Don’t move,” he said.

“Not moving,” Sabina said, which was an admission that she had thought of moving.

“Someone made a funnel,” Marek said softly. “For what?”

Behind him, something clonked. Instinct moved him faster than habit; he reached out as the bottle nearest Sabina tipped. It didn’t tip because of wind. It tipped because the spiral had been set like a row of dominoes and you can only hold back the first one, after which the second will push the third and the third will push the fourth and the whole logic comes down singing.

He knocked the first bottle away. It shattered against his knuckles; pain blossomed electric. Glass carried a secret that it only sometimes shared with him—it remembered sand. It remembered pressure. It remembered when it had been transparent and then hardened and then thought it was done and then shattered and then spread itself into the air like sugar. The taste of it in his mouth made his tongue go dumb.

He threw the broken part toward the fence, a quick, ugly motion. The spiral’s hum suffocated. Sabina had not moved. The glittering center lay quiet, nearly chastened. Marek breathed. Ondrej swore in a language that had a lot of r’s.

“What was it?” Ondrej said.

“A trap,” Marek said. “Not for feet. For listening.”

Sabina, whispering because her own voice sounded too big: “For people like us.”

“Someone who doesn’t sort,” Marek said. “Someone who doesn’t give anything back.”

“That’s dramatic,” Sabina said, because she was still young enough to believe that if you named a thing dramatic it might stop being dangerous.

Marek stood and let the cut bleed a moment. Blood likes its stage time. Then he pressed his palm against his coat and looked around. There were tracks. Everyone always believed the city never noticed them, but the city noticed everything. There was a drag mark where a bag had been pulled, a heel that pivoted too sharply, a smear of something sticky that was not sugar. He put two fingers into the smear and smelled. Petroleum, sweet, with a note of newness. Gluing agent. Whoever had braided the bags had used synthetic. Bolder than that, he had done it here. He knew he would not be stopped.

“Ondrej,” Marek said. “Do your cameras work?”

Ondrej shrugged with a despair that had built a small home in his shoulder. “They work when they want. Like my cousin. We’ll pull the feeds.”

“Pull everything since this morning,” Marek said. “No. Since yesterday evening.”

“You think he came at night?” Sabina asked.

“He has a perverse sense of timing,” Marek said, and did not know yet why he knew that like truth.

On their way back, they stopped at the foot of the bridge to watch a boat push the river aside. The light on the water made broken math. Sabina tied a handkerchief around his knuckles, not because he needed it—his skin was already closing, the glass whispering: sorry, sorry—but because she wanted to do something that ached like being helpful.

“Whoever did that,” she said, “they knew stuff.”

“They know how to read the stream under the street,” Marek said. “But they dislike the stream.”

“You mean—?”

“They don’t recycle,” he said, and smiled without humor. “They don’t put things back where they belong.”

“That’s a stupid reason to be evil.”

“It’s not stupidity. It’s contempt.”

By evening the rumor had climbed up Kapucínska like ivy: someone had set a thing at the waste site, a trap made of glass, an art that was not art. Two older men argued about patterns in the subway tiles and whether kids these days could tie a knot. A teenager rolled by on a skateboard the color of bruise and said, “It’s probably that wizard that moved into Františkánske.” Marek pricked an ear. There had been whispers, already, about a new man. Handsome. Tall. He wore a coat the way a story wears a beginning, and he did not put bottles into bins, he dropped them beside the curb as if the curb were a mouth that would swallow them. People noticed. People always notice elegance. They notice contempt less and then later they tell themselves they hadn’t.

In the shop, just at close, the door opened and a young man, too cleanly cut to be trouble and too carefully polite to be anything but, stepped in, holding a clock.

“Please,” he said. “This belonged to my aunt. The spring is tired.”

Marek took the clock, turned it, listened. The spring was not tired. The spring was hiding. “Leave it,” he said. “Tomorrow.”

The young man smiled his thanks. He had the sort of smile that believes it can pay with interest. He left. Afterward, the clock in Marek’s hands seemed to be beating faintly off, one-two, pause, three-four, breathing between beats. Strange. He took it to the bench anyway, because you don’t suspect every stranger of bringing a snake in a basket. You’d tire. He opened the back and set the small mechanism on felt. A bit of grit had lodged near the tooth of a gear. He lifted it with tweezers. The grit nipped his fingertip, playful-sharp. He drew back. Then he laughed aloud, at himself, at how witches’ tales teach us more than we know.

“Don’t work late,” Sabina said, coat on, half out the door. “I have a test tomorrow.”

“Go sleep.”

“I’ll dream in triangles.”

“Dream in circles,” he suggested. “They come back to you in the morning.”

When she was gone and the street had grown its dusk face, he locked the front door and sat in the back room, where the jars on the shelves glowed faintly with their old loves. He put his finger against the cut and felt his skin being careful. He was going to go home, to the small flat above a butcher where the ghost of meat lived in the floorboards, and he was going to eat something unambitious and read a chapter and fall asleep in a chair like an old man. He was about to stand when the back door—it gave onto an alley narrow as gossip—squealed a sound like a coin to a beggar. He froze. Rats used the alley. Cats did too, and they got along like two poems in one book.

Then a voice. From the alley. A man’s voice, warmer than it should have been for November, with an accent that had traveled. “Marek!” it called, as if he were already a friend. “Marek Košík!”

Marek walked to the door, put his palm flat against it, listened. The wood did not tell him fear. He opened it a crack.

The man in the alley was tall, ridiculous coat, dark hair, a smile that took things without you noticing. He had the sort of face you saw in a mirror when you wanted to deceive yourself: symmetrical, suggestible. He was holding a wine bottle by its neck the way you might hold a rabbit by the scruff. He took a step forward, a courtly little bow. “I wanted to bring over a welcome. We are nearly neighbors.”

Marek said nothing. He looked at the bottle. It was green. It had a white label with a set of deliberate stains. Again: intention.

“I heard you’re a good hand with broken things,” the man said. “I am a breaking sort of man. We could help each other.”

“Who are you?” Marek asked.

The man smiled wider. “You can call me Viliam,” he said. “My friends call me Vim. And my enemies call me worse.”

“Viliam what?”

He told him a surname that had teeth in it. Zúb. Tooth. It might have been a joke. Marek tucked the sound of it away. He extended his hand because he had been raised on Karpatská by a grandmother who believed you greet everyone and then decide later what you think.

Viliam did not take his hand. He tilted the bottle toward him invitingly. “I thought we could share,” he said. “Get to know how our work intersects.”

“You don’t recycle,” Marek said, not a question.

Viliam’s face went briefly complicated, then smoothed. He had a way of letting shadows pass over him and then deciding whether to keep one. “I find the current obsession with sorting tedious,” he said mildly. “I like directness.”

“You mean you like throwing things away,” Marek said.

“Everything is thrown away,” Viliam said softly. “Everything ends eventually. It is the vain that pretend otherwise.” He looked up at the slice of sky like a thin flag over the alley. “Entropy is honest.”

“I make things whole,” Marek said.

Viliam leaned in. Marek could smell something like mint cut with metal. “You make people feel like the ending is not really an ending,” he said. “You smooth the edges so they won’t cut their fingers on the truth. You’re a liar, Marek. A kind liar. But still.”

Marek felt a flare of anger that was old and childish and wanted to throw something. He didn’t. He crossed his arms. “Have a good night,” he said pleasantly, and closed the door.

It did not latch. Viliam put the toe of his shoe in, polite as a guest who didn’t want to be left on the stoop. “Be careful,” he said. “Where you put your bins. Where you put your hands.”

“Are you warning me, or threatening me?”

“Warning,” Viliam said, and his smile was almost sweet. “Tomorrow the city will hold you to a standard you cannot meet.”

“Because?”

“Because I will help it remember the rules,” he said. “Good night.”

Marek put his shoulder against the door and made it close on the wedge of Viliam’s shoe. He and the door shared a lovely solidarity for a second—wood and flesh both deciding to insist. Viliam withdrew, laughter like a glass settling into a cupboard. Silence, then. The alley’s particular rat resumed its small work. Marek stood very still, pulse in his hands, and hated how that man had stepped toward him like a question he didn’t want to answer.

He slept badly. He dreamed of widowed spoons. He woke with a start at three to the sound of a truck braking, the long sigh of air, a bag tearing, a bottle rolling. He went to the window and looked down. The street lay under its sodium blanket. Someone had left a pizza box on the curb. Shadows moved without the generosity of bodies.

The morning came the way it always does, with bread smell, with Adam on the corner warming his hands on a paper cup and giving news as if he were a radio. Marek washed, dressed, fed the tiny thing in his chest that needs tea. He went down early to the shop because it felt right to work under the front of the day when its face was fresh. He unlocked and stepped in, and something in his foot found something on the floor near the counter. He looked down. Shards. Blue shards. Scoop of them, under the bench. His lungs did a small, idiotic jump.

He looked at the shelves. The cobalt jar was open, its lid askew, the fine dust of it along the lip like a small drought. He kept the jars sorted like one keeps prayers in a rosary. His gran had taught him that: “Keep your beads in order, Mareček,” she’d told him, “or the prayers will tangle and you won’t know which God you’ve called.” He checked the other jars. The green glass had flecks of brown. The bronze had steel filings like a cold star spilled into it. Someone had tugged one label half off, and under it, a hand—he could see the carefulness, the way someone does badness elegantly—had written in pencil: same.

His mouth tasted like unsaid words. He went to the back door. It was locked. The front had been locked. The alley’s cat, the black one with the one white toe, looked up from a puddle and scowled. He went back to the bench. The clock from the young man sat there, innocent as a witness. He opened it again, though he had corrected it already, just to look, just to feel. A fold of paper had been tucked under the spring. It smelled of a glove.

He unfolded it. It looked blank at first. Then, slowly, under the light, faint grey letters rose like bruises. The ink had been written with a solvent, thin as breath, that had dried under heat. The solvent had been made from something you didn’t put in green or yellow or blue bins. The letters spelled: Entropy is honest. The lower right corner had a small symbol. Not Viliam’s initials. Something like a bin with its lid cracked open.

“Sabina,” he said, though she wasn’t there. The bell on the door chimed, right then, because the city likes drama more than he pretends. She stood on the threshold, wind to her, scarf in her mouth, about to say hello and then the word died because her eyes were already on his shelves and the grammar of labels.

“What happened?” she said.

“Someone mixed the prayers,” he said, and felt—the way you can feel the heart of a violin when you hold it under your chin—how the city’s system slid a notch out of true and did not yet decide whether to complain.

She put her bag down carefully, like she thought the floor might open if she dropped it. “We’ll sort it.”

“We can,” he said. He put his hand into the cobalt jar and lifted a pinch of blue, let it fall back like colored sand. “But it takes time. It takes attention. And he knows that.”

“Who?”

He looked at the alley door. “A man with a neat coat and no bins in his future.”

She opened her mouth to swear. She didn’t. She pulled the small stool to the shelf and climbed it and started to sort, her fingers quick and exact. He wanted to protect her from the tedium of it, which is to say he wanted to protect her from how the enemy had known this would humiliate him. The work of suturing was not glamorous. It required time. It asked you to not resent time. Viliam had turned his work into punishment. That is what a dirty trick looks like in a shop like this.

At ten, two men in city suits arrived. Not vests. Suits. They had official courtesy like a sterile utensil. One of them held a clipboard. The other had a badge like a polite threat.

“Pán Košík,” the clipboard said. “We have had a report. There is contamination in your storage. A citizen has expressed concern.”

“What citizen?” Sabina asked fiercely.

“An anonymous citizen,” Clipboard said, with a small smile that admitted he hated that phrase as much as anyone.

“Come in,” Marek said, because refusing is worse. He stood aside. They looked. They took notes. They did not look for long. They had known what they would find. One of them lifted the lid of the cobalt jar as if lids were not commitments. “There is mixing,” he said. “We have strict regulations.” His eyes said: I am sorry. His mouth said: The rules today are very strict.

“I can sort it,” Marek said. He heard his own voice and disliked it for how it sounded like a plea. “It will be clean in an hour.”

“In the meantime,” Clipboard said, “we must ask you to close. Temporary suspension. We will return.” He gave a paper the color of laws. On it were boxes with ticks in them. He could smell the toner.

Sabina said a word that had a wolf in it. The men ignored her, which is how you make a young person believe in revolution.

“Who complained?” Marek asked again. He did not get an answer, which is how you make an old person quiet down.

They left with that carefulness again of people who have done what they were told and aren’t sure if it makes them clean. The bell made no musical comment.

Sabina looked at him. If you live long enough, you get used to certain qualities of gaze. This one was like a lit match. “So,” she said. “War.”

“Something like that.”

“I can call people. Petition. Email. There are forms.”

“We will sort this,” he said. “Both the jars and the men.”

“How?”

“By doing what we do,” he said. “By being annoying and patient.”

She snorted. “Annoyingly patient.”

He smiled. The smile felt like a splint on something cracked. He closed the front, turned the sign, and the shop, for the first time since his father had shown him its first shelf, held its breath in the daytime. Outside, the bins along the curb all had their lids closed, resting in a line like soldiers at ease. The blue one had been rolled to a new spot. It was almost, but not quite, in the wrong place. He looked at the gap it left, the thin outline of dust where it had lived yesterday, and he felt the geography of his street tilt a half-degree.

He called Ondrej. There had been footage. In pixel mud, between midnight and dawn, a figure in a long coat had carried a bag into the waste site and one by one set down bottles by the light of his phone. He moved like someone dancing alone. He moved like he believed he had an audience. He moved like he believed the audience was stupid.

“He didn’t care if he was seen,” Ondrej said.

“He cared,” Marek said. “He wanted to be seen by the right eyes.”

“And you saw him.”

“I did,” Marek said. “And he came to my door and told me so.” He touched his knuckles. The cut had sealed over in a thin silver mood. He thought of Viliam’s smile like a ring on a finger that does not belong to you. Honest, he had said. Entropy is honest. Marek wanted to disagree. But there is a weight to truth even when it is hateful. Ends are honest. The trick is whether you join them. Or if you stitch. Or if you call a stitch a lie and walk away.

At noon, Pani Běla knocked, saw the sign, saw his face, and pushed her way in anyway. She set a paper bag on the counter. The bag had in it two bowls, still warm.

“You will eat,” she said. “And then you will fight.”

“I am fine,” he started, but the smell untied his mash of petty pride; cabbage, smoked meat, potatoes. She tapped the orders on the shelf with her knuckle. “They want to tell you where to put your bits,” she said. “We have survived worse. They should tell this Viliam person where to put his bottles.”

“His name has already grown a shadow,” Marek said.

She made a face. “He is the sort of man who takes. He took a book from me yesterday, in my shop, and pressed money into my hand in a way that said: do not make me count change.”

“What book?”

“The Old Ways of the River,” she said. “That old fool Ján’s diaries. He claims he is a collector.”

“He is,” Marek said. “He collects ends.”

“This will end him,” she said, with the cheer of someone who has smoked long and intends to die of something else. She touched his arm. “Eat.”

He ate. The food was warm and democratic. It reminded him that taking care is a verb that needs breakfast and lunch. After, he washed the bowls, put them on the shelf, and began re-sorting the jars. Thousand grains of blue into blue. Sabina hummed, which meant she was angry. The afternoon slipped its shoes off and sat cross-legged.

At four, the clock on the bench—aunt’s, tired spring—ticked too loudly and then stopped. He went to it and listened. The silence inside had a shape. He opened it again, angry at whoever had used an object as a courier for petty insults. The paper had been removed, but something else remained. At the bottom of the case, under the felt, a thin line of sand. No. Not sand. Polystyrene shaved so fine it behaved like sand if sand had forgotten water. He lifted one grain. It stuck to his finger with a cling that made his mouth go dry. A word swam up from a long-ago book. Atra. Residue. What is left when you burn things you shouldn’t. The word tastes like char.

He thought of the blue bin. He thought of his shelves. He thought of men in suits with neat boxes and of Viliam in the alley with his bottle and his smile. He thought of the spiral on the concrete. He went to the drawer where he kept the small brush he used for mosaics. He took it and a jar with a lid and he brushed the grains into the jar like a man collecting insects to prove they exist. He labeled the jar: V. Residue. He didn’t like giving the man a letter. But names have uses too.

He stepped back, wiped his hands, and looked at the shop. It had not changed. Except of course it had. He had to allow that. He had to allow that the story, which had been a simple one—repair; return; repeat—now had an antagonist. Heroes are made not by their skills but by their enemies. He hated that. He wanted to be nobody’s hero. He wanted to be an old craftsman with neat thumbnails.

The sun pushed itself down behind the castle and the lamps came on with their astonished sound. Sabina tied her scarf. “Do you want me to stay?”

“No,” he said. “Go, do your triangles. If I need you I’ll call. And keep the glass you find. Even the little bits.”

“I always do,” she said, and then, at the door, because she was young and kind, she turned and added: “We’ll win.” She said it with the faith of someone who hadn’t yet learned that winning sometimes means enduring. But it lit something in him anyway.

Alone, he turned the sign again. He stood by the window. He watched the blue bin. The wind didn’t move it. The night pivoted on its hinge. Somewhere not far away, a bottle rolled a little and stopped, and the sound didn’t feel like chance. It felt like a man making a small elegant gesture that could not be politely called by the word it deserved.

Marek gathered the jars. He put the cobalt into a drawer, the green into another. He locked them. He put the clock mechanism into a tin. He wrote a note to himself as if he were someone else and might forget: Not honest. Honest ends are what we make them. He smiled at that, because it was stupid and he liked it. He blew out the candle whose smell he preferred to the overhead lights’ hum. He went to the back door to check the bolt again, because checking bolts makes certain personalities feel they have put a shoulder against the day.

When he put his palm to the door, he felt a pulse from the wood. Not fear. Not a rat. Something had leaned on the other side, briefly. Someone. He put his ear to it. As if in answer, a voice—a whisper that had been made to be a whisper by magic, not by distance—spoke right where his ear was. It said his name, twice, so low it almost asked to be forgiven. Then it said: “Tomorrow.” And then, more amused: “Check your bins.”

He didn’t sleep that night either. He lay on his back and stared at the ceiling and counted the cracks. He expected fear to come. It didn’t. What came instead was a feeling he hadn’t let in since a man with a gun at the square had been too close to his father at the wrong time: the outrage you feel when someone tries to rearrange what you love while you are watching. The outrage that is also dawn.

Morning brought police tape, not for him but for the space around the bins at the end of the street. Someone had rearranged them in the night as if they were chess pieces. The blue stood where the green had been. The green was on the curb. The yellow had been tilted into a ridiculous angle, its lid wedged open with a single bottle. On the side of the yellow, scrawled neatly in a hand that tried to be anonymous and failed, someone had written: UNSORT YOURSELF.

“Very funny,” Sabina said when she arrived. “Very, very original.”

He was about to joke, to lighten the ugly little wish inside her for righteous arson, when a city car pulled up and a woman with short hair and too much stress in her long neck got out. “Pán Košík?” she called. “You’ll have to come with me.”

“What for?” he asked, already knowing.

“There’s a fire,” she said. “At the Petržalka site. And your name is on a note.”

He swallowed. Bile tastes like old coins. He nodded. He picked up his coat, his keys, and the jar labeled V. Residue. He put it in his pocket. He locked his door with the exactness of someone closing one book and opening another too quickly. He followed the woman to the car. She drove like someone who has had to reverse often in bad places. He watched the city slide, chapterless, out of the corner of his eye. The UFO bridge wore its stupid grin. The river pretended nothing had happened.

The fire was already mostly out when they arrived. Smoke is a kind of memory. It holds shapes badly. The black patch on the ground was exactly where the spiral had been. Ondrej stood there, face older than yesterday. He held a plastic tag in his hand, the kind you clip to bags. On it, neat letters. KOŠÍK. There was a little smile drawn next to it, a circle with lines like a sun. The smile was a thumbprint. Marek would have known the arrogance of that thumb anywhere now.

“Dirty trick,” he said. His voice didn’t shake. It took the small step forward that brings you into the next page. “So be it.”The fire left a taste in the air like nails. Even hours after the hoses had hissed and coughed and the last petulant flames had sulked out under boots, the Petržalka collection point smelled like someone had tried to burn a law and the law had smoked. Ondrej stood with his hands on his hips and his hat crumpled under one elbow, and when he saw Marek he looked ashamed, as if fires were personal failures when they happened on his watch. The woman with the tight shoulders introduced herself as Zuzana, Environment, and spoke like a person used to asking people to hold their breath and sign things.

“This was not a big burn,” she said, as if minimizing would move the heat out of the picture. “Contained. But it is enough to make us write reports. There was a note.”

She handed him the tag with his name, and Marek thought: if you were a child and wanted to make a bad joke, you would write your brother’s name on the wall and hope your mother would scold in that direction. But this wasn’t childish. It was precise. The edges of the tag were scorched in a pattern that suggested someone had held a flame to each corner in turn, letting the black creep and then blowing it out. The little sun-smile inked in one corner wore a ring of ash like a saint.

“May I?” he asked, and when Zuzana nodded he took the tag between his fingers, closed his eyes, and inclined his head. The plastic remembered friction. Not fire first. The scrape of a glove. A hinge. The click it had been made for. It remembered being pulled snug through a little slot and the momentary satisfaction of being locked. Viliam had danced his hands around this like a musician tuning. He could hear, faintly, the cadence of someone humming under his breath. The tune meant nothing. Or perhaps it meant Everything ends.

He crouched by the blackened patch and touched the concrete. Concrete is a consensus of stones and cement and water that requires agreement to become itself. It does not like to be altered after it has set its mind. Under his palm he could feel the rough of aggregate and, in the first millimeter, the way the heat had altered the surface. Grass that had grown in the crack to the left had whipped, then knelt. The burn had not reached it. It had not wanted to. This was not an angry fire. It was a pointing finger.

He let his fingertips collect what they could: a smear, some gritty gleam, a smell that had once been citrus and then been made ill by chemical relatives. He took out the little jar from his pocket and tipped the fine, deceptive sand into it. Sabina would have said: it is absurd, collecting sand from a place where the ground is nothing else. But this was not ground. This was dust pretending.

Zuzana crouched too, less gracefully, her trousers tight at the knees. “They will ask you questions,” she said. “I will have to ask you questions. You have enemies?” The way she said enemies was practical. She had dealt with neighbor feuds, with fences, with smoke from illegal barrels.

“I have a man who dislikes me,” he said. “It is not yet enough to make me call him enemy.”

“And this man put your name here?”

“He would call it a correction,” Marek said, and thought of Viliam’s mouth making the word honest into a key to any lock.

Ondrej cleared his throat. “We pulled the camera footage. We will print it on paper if that makes the right people kinder to it. You can see the figure. Tall. He moves like he thinks he owns the way his body fits through space.” Ondrej’s contempt made a small comfort in the cold. “Here.” He handed Marek a plastic sleeve with stills that had printed their pixellated doubt onto cheap office paper. The figure could have been any man in a long coat with good shoulders. If Marek had wanted to, he could have seen himself.

“No face,” Zuzana said. “But the shoe is distinctive.” She pointed. The heel of the figure’s left shoe had a V-shape scuff where leather had met cobble badly. “I will send this to the city police. They will tell me we are being dramatic.”

“Let them,” Marek said. “Meanwhile, I can do a thing they cannot.” He dipped his finger into the black, lifted it. “I can ask the place to remember.”

He closed his eyes. The trick with listening is always the quiet afterward. You ask, and then you shut up. The concrete had been made in a batch that morning someone’s radio had played a country song from not this country at all, a tune about trucks that had made the mixing man roll his eyes. The men at the site stamped their feet. Later, much later, a man’s breath gathered itself and slipped like a rope through his teeth. He hummed. He set down glass in a spiral and paused and moved and paused and each pause had the quality of a step for applause. He took from his pocket a little vial. He sprinkled. He spoke a word. The word had the flavor of Latin but had been made in a century that liked lasers. The spiral woke. The place flinched. The nearest bottle quivered with the eagerness of catching and passing along.

Then Marek, with his knuckles, with his impatience, with the part of himself that refused to let other people’s games finish, had broken the first piece and the hum had been broken like a string.

Heat later. Controlled, efficient. A lighter with a wide, pretty flame, the kind that makes a man feel like an elegant villain in a film. The heat licked the center and lay down. This was not a fire that wanted mouths to cough. It wanted someone to show up with a clipboard.

He opened his eyes. “He wanted the blame to be tidy,” he said. “He is tidy, my friend.”

“You speak like a poet,” Zuzana said, but not unkindly. “The hearing is at two tomorrow. You will come. If you do not come they will come to you.”

“Two,” he repeated. He stared at the black and thought of time as a loop that pretends to be a line. “I will bring you something by then.”

“What?” she asked, weary and curious all at once.

“A story the ground agrees to tell,” he said. “And a little jar of his pride.”

Zuzana’s mouth softened. “Bring a lawyer too.”

“I am poor,” he said, and meant he was poor in the wrong currency.

They drove back along the river, the UFO pretending it hadn’t seen any of this. Petržalka’s boxes watched themselves be ugly and endured it with a fatalism Marek had always found strangely moving. In the back seat, the jar of residue ticked against the glass of the window with each bump. He imagined Sabina’s face when he put it on the bench. She would call it gross and then she would be very tender with it. He thought of the clock with the little folded insult, of his shelves, of the neat labels that had been tugged crooked. He did not want to give Viliam the gift of being grateful for a worthy adversary. He wanted to be ridiculous and declare this all beneath him. He wanted to go home and mend an umbrella and be alone with hinges. He pressed his tongue against the back of his teeth and tasted the metallic persistence of action instead.

Sabina was waiting outside the shop like a small storm leaning on a lamppost. When she spotted the car she straightened and stared, reading Zuzana’s body like she’d read a weather map. She met them at the door and took the jar without being told not to shake it. She didn’t shake it. When listeners become partners, their hands become exact.

“What now?” she said, sprinting ahead of Zuzana’s slower, official pace. “Do we call the newspapers? I know a girl in my class whose brother runs a site. He publishes whistleblowers and conspiracy theories and photos of cats with broomsticks.”

“Let’s not make cartoons out of ourselves yet,” Marek said. “We will make a list instead.”

“Of what?”

“Of everything he has already touched.” He pointed at the jars. “These. The clock. The bins on Kapucínska. The spiral. The tag with my name. The book he bought from Pani Běla.” He saw her eyebrows jump at that. Sabina adored patterns, and there are few better moments in a pattern than when a previously trivial item lights up.

“What book?”

“Old river diaries.”

“The ones from the man who built little dams in places he shouldn’t? The weir obsession guy?” She pronounced weir with a reverent curiosity.

“The same,” he said. “The sort of man who thinks that if you tuck water, it will stay tucked.”

She laughed, then sobered. “He will read it and find old tools to build new traps.”

“Which means he is not original,” Marek said mildly. “Which means he can be predicted. Which means he can be interrupted.”

Zuzana had paused at the threshold, as if she did not want to track municipal worry onto the shop’s wooden floor. “I should go,” she said. “I am already at the end of my day. I will send you the notice in the morning. There will be talk of fines. I do not know if my director is the kind of person who can be convinced with a story about… about the way concrete keeps a diary.” Her mouth made the shape of a smile and could not convince her cheeks to join in.

“Bring her a jar,” Sabina suggested. “People like to hold evidence.”

Zuzana looked down at her hands. They were clean in the way that means many things had been washed off. “People also like to hold onto their jobs,” she said wryly. Then, as if she had to get something right today: “I will try. I am very good at being annoying and patient.”

They both liked her better for that and showed it in their faces, which is, in the end, a kind of luck.

After she left, the shop felt briefly like a church where a prayer had just been said and now everyone wanted to stand without seeming to hurry. Sabina set the jar on the bench and drew the blinds halfway, not to hide but to make the light a little softer for thinking. Marek took the Old Ways volume down from the shelf where returns and loans sat waiting. It was not there. He looked where he had not put it. He looked on the chair where Pani Běla had once left a hat and forgotten it. He looked under the stool to satisfy the logic of narrative. No book. He fished his phone out of his pocket and called the bookshop.

“Košík,” Pani Běla answered, because she did not believe in hello as a necessary fiction. “Tell me you have eaten the rest of your lunch, it breaks my heart to feed men who leave half.”

“The diary,” he said. “He bought it from you. Do you have a second copy? A cousin? A cousin of a cousin?”

“I have seven cousins,” she said. “None of them are books.”

“Anything like it?”

“I have a ledger from a man who measured ice on the Danube for thirty years and never admitted he liked poetry. Why?”

“Because he is reading it,” Marek said. “And he is the sort of boy who will remember a knot and use it to tie up a bin.”

“He will not have my ledger,” she said, with an old woman’s casual murderousness. “I locked it in a drawer with a spoon. He cannot open a spoon.”

“Do you have time to come by?”

“I am not idle, Mareček,” she said, but he could hear already the rustle of her coat and the small protest of the bell over her door as she decided yes, she did, because deciding to be useful is a habit with its own calendar. “Five minutes,” she said. “You make the tea.”

He made the tea. While it steeped, he and Sabina poured the contents of the jar onto a piece of white paper just big enough to make the tiny grains look like a map. Up close, the paillasse shimmer of polystyrene was nauseously pretty. It clung to the hairs of his wrist and then, chastened, let itself be brushed back onto the page. The smell was wrong in a way the nose recognizes before the mind puts a name to it. He leaned in, not to sniff but to listen, because even the residue of burning has narrative. This had been shaved from something cheap, then shaved again from something smaller. Viliam had wanted powder. Not too much. Enough to make a circle that would hold a whisper. Enough to call a specific sort of attention. He heard the scrape of a blade with serrations too small for kitchen use. He heard once, faintly, a huff of frustration when a clump stayed clumped. He heard humming. The same non-song.

Sabina, watching his face the way a good student watches a seam, said, “He hums when he works.”

“He hums because he wants a witness,” Marek said. “He hums for the cameras.”

“And for himself.”

“And for the ghosts of whatever teacher in his life told him his hands were clever,” Marek added, and felt unaccountably sorry for a moment for the boy Viliam had been, which irritated him.

Pani Běla arrived, the bell doing a comic little quaver for the pleasure of pleasing her. She took off her gloves, put her flat hands around the tea glass like warming a decision, and listened to the bits of the story they gave her without interruption.

“Who tells the city to move its bins?” she asked when they were done.

“A person with a neat coat and a smile and an ability to make people who like rules feel purposeful in the wrong direction,” Sabina said. “Also, apparently, a lighter.”

“We all like to feel useful,” Běla said, sighing. “That is the problem. They have made a religion out of it. You”—she tapped one nail on the table, then Marek’s collarbone—“you do things quietly. People like the noise better.”

“Noise is easier to sell,” Marek said, and wondered if bitterness would help him with anything. It would not. It soothed nothing. It was sugar for people who don’t like their tea.

“What will you do,” she asked, “other than stew like cabbage and make your apprentice knit nets around the bins?”

“Knitting nets around the bins is not a bad plan,” Sabina began, and Marek, because he has tenderness for youthful extremes, let her have the idea for a full three seconds.

“We will do three things,” he said. “One, we will make a public thing that is ours. Something beautiful with glass that says: we see. Two, we will set a watch. Not just here. Ondrej can help us at his sites. We will recruit the old men who sit on benches and the women with dogs and the teenagers who know how to watch without being noticed. Three, we will go to him.”

“You know where?” Běla asked.

“Františkánske,” he said. “There is a flat there that has made itself invisible to my attention. It is too perfect. That is a sign. Men like this like to live in well-cut shadows. Also he told me we are nearly neighbors, which was a lie, but not by much.”

“You will knock on his door and he will invite you in and offer you something to drink,” she said. “Do not drink it.”

“I am not a child,” he said, and all three of them laughed at his vanity.

Sabina had her phone already in her hand, her thumbs doing a quick, small dance. “Group chat is up,” she said. “Name?”

“Bins Watch,” Marek suggested, and she made a face.

“We can do better. Sutúrna,” she said, spelling it to herself, “but make it sound like a band. Sutúrna Patrol. No. Too much. Sutúrna will do. I’m adding Adam, Ondrej, my cousin in Petržalka, the boy on the purple skateboard—he told me you fixed his mother’s ring; he owes us—and three pensioners who do tai chi in the square at eight. They see everything at knee height.”

“You are dangerous,” Pani Běla said, admiring. “Be dangerous for me too. Remind me to bring my ugly blue vase. I am ready to love its ugliness, but I want you to stitch it with gold so I don’t have to pretend.”

“You are an aesthete and a socialist,” Marek told her, and went to put on his coat.

The building on Františkánske had been renovated into sleekness, the sort of sleekness that pretends it is not expensive by being white. The door downstairs had a keypad that someone had covered with a polite square of plastic so that the rain would not distemper it. The numbers were smudged in a way that told you which ones people liked to press together. Marek did not need to guess. He was, after all, in a country that had once loved the number one like a hymn. The door opened with a soft electronics purr that didn’t belong to the bones of the building.

The corridor smelled faintly of lemon and absence. He went up two flights, his hand running along the banister out of habit, letting the wood tell him the short history of all those who had moved in with large hopes and too many boxes. Outside the door with the new brass numbers—8, as innocent as any number unless you are a superstitious musician—he paused, his mouth tasting the sort of decision that either gets you stories to tell or sends you home with your pockets turned out. He knocked.

A pause, the sort that has a smile in it. The door opened. It was not Viliam there but a woman in a T-shirt that said in perfect English: Everything Goes Somewhere. Her eyebrows declared she was weary of being right. She had a tattoo of a waterline on her inner forearm. She took in Marek’s face, the way his coat sat on him like he’d slept in it, and tilted her head.

“Hi,” she said, with a Polish-tinged English. “He is not here.”

“You know who I am visiting?” he asked, surprised in a way he tried to hide with the old European trick of narrowing his eyes.

“You are the man with the jars,” she said. “He told me. He asked me to give you back your manners if you forgot them at the door.”

“I brought my manners and my knuckles,” Marek said. “I will use one and then the other if I must.”

She laughed, and the laugh was a much better sound than anyone had a right to expect in that building. “Come,” she said. “I am Marta. I clean. I clean for men who like to have no dust on their stupid ideas. I also clean for old women who smell like good soup and say thank you. He pays more. They break my heart less.”

Inside, Viliam’s flat was exactly what Marek had expected it to be and therefore worse: bare surfaces, the carefully displayed object here and there like a white lie—an antique level on the shelf, a bottle with a plant clipping that would never be allowed to grow roots long enough to ask for a pot. The windows were big, and the light that came through them looked like it had filed its teeth. On the coffee table lay The Old Ways of the River, open, facedown to protect its spine more than its contents. A pencil lay across it with no bite marks.

“He left very early,” Marta said. “He told me not to mix his… how do you say… piles.” She glanced at the table. Marek followed her gaze. Three stacks of objects, not books. Tags, lids, bits of twine, receipts. One stack had been sorted by color. One by length. One by some logic that was not immediately legible. His fingertips itched.

“May I?” he asked, and Marta shrugged in the generous way of people who have weighed which of their employers would give them trouble and decided to back the one who might save their daughter from making the same mistakes.

He approached the stacks second. He went to the table first and lifted the diary. It fell open to a page where a man with meticulous spite had drawn a weir and then, below, written in a hand like rain: The river wants to sort us if we let it. You can hear her. The gloss that had been added recently was in pencil and was harder and faster. It read: If you sort the river for her, she will be grateful and quiet. Marek did not care for that. Gratitude has a way of being demanded from the wrong sources. He closed the book and then opened it again three pages further where a word had a tick in the margin. Skracovač. Shortener. A creature men had once blamed for floods by claiming he went along the streams with a knife and cut off the pieces the river didn’t like and then threw them back in somewhere else. Men had invented many names for the weather and then pretended the names meant they had power.

Marta, watching him read his own breath, walked to the bookshelf and took down something from behind a row of tall, boring magazines. She handed him a folded paper. “This was in the bin,” she said. “Not the bin he puts out. The bin in the cupboard. He hid it badly.”

Marek unfolded it. It was a plan for the layout of the collection point. A copy of a municipal diagram. In red, a spiral sketched. In blue, notes about camera angles, what they could see, what they could not. In the margin, a little smile with lines like a sun. The thumbprint again, thoughtless show-off. He felt rage come up in him, the stupid kind that wants to tear paper, and he let it wash his cheeks and then pass, because he liked his hands better whole.

“We will take this,” he said, and realized he had used the plural without thinking. “And we will take the old man’s book, which does not belong to him.”

Marta shook her head. “Take the copies. I made them when he was out, because I grew up with a mother who told me that men who care very much about where you put your shoes will one day tell you where to put your life. He will notice if his book is gone. He will punish me with his little silence.”

“You are clever,” Marek said. “And you are not on his side.”

“I am on my own side,” she said, simply, and he loved her for it a little. “Also, your apprentice came to my house once to tell my neighbor to put the right trash in the right bag without making her feel stupid. I owe you both a favor.”

He put the copied plan and the diary copy under his coat and then, because he believed in returning something to a room when you take something out of it, he drew a small slip of paper from his pocket and placed it on the table under the pencil. On it he had written, with a calm he had forged like a little blade, the words: My work mends. Yours cuts. Even gods prefer mending. It was petty. He did not mind being petty one time.

“Be careful,” Marta said, as he turned to go. “He is charming when he wants to be. I was a girl who liked men who talk. He has that look in a different season.”

“I am a man who likes women who see,” he said. “We will bring you back the room he wants to steal from you.” He didn't know what he meant exactly by room, but Marta nodded as if he had said something practical about a shelf.

Down on the street, he stood on the pavement and exhaled. Sabina texted him three pictures in quick succession: a man with a dog tying the green lid with a scrap of string and smirking at his own rebellion; a teenager in a hoodie leaning on a bin like a bodyguard; Adam on the corner holding up a hand-lettered sign that said: Put your bottle in. The group chat was already thick with small victories. A photograph of a child scolding her father gently. A video of someone putting a pizza box in the paper bin and then taking it out again and flattening it because someone off camera said “takto!” and demonstrated. It was both nothing and the sort of thing that keeps a city from thinking it can fail and be forgiven.

He stopped at the bookshop to kiss Běla on both cheeks and give her the copy of the old diary to guard like a relic. She swatted him for the cheek kisses and said she would sleep with it under her pillow and let it tell her if men had always been fools by a larger percentage than women.

Back in the shop, as evening eased itself down, Sabina had reminded the jars who they were. The cobalt lay in a square of light, purely itself again. He felt such a stupid rush of love at the sight that he had to look away and pretend it was because the kettle had just boiled and he had to pour. They worked side by side while the neighborhood turned its lamp eyes on and off and the tram announced each passing with a small gain in knowledge. They did not speak much. There is a joy in work that talk dampens.

At nine, the front door opened without the bell sounding. It did that when certain people didn’t want bells. Marek looked up sharply, hand on the bench as if it were a gun. It was not the man in the coat. It was a policeman from the quarter whose mother had wept when Marek fixed her valise and who had insisted on paying with apples. He took off his cap and pressed it against his thigh as if humility might make his uniform less obtuse.

“Pán Košík,” he said. “I have been told to tell you not to leave the city until the hearing. Because you are a potential… person of interest.”

“I have nowhere else to be,” Marek said, with an irony that did not quite hide the small pain of remembering that in this city, a man like him could be both entirely at home and completely peripheral.

“I did not see the fire,” the policeman said. “I saw a man in a coat I do not like in a place I did not expect him to be. But I cannot prove it to you in writing.” He pulled something from his breast pocket. He unfolded it. It was a napkin. On it, in a careful block hand, an address. “Someone told me that if you were interested in the shoes of that man, you might find evidence of the way he walks at this cobbler’s. The cobbler was too afraid to tell me in a way that would make me comfortable in front of my superior. He thought you might be more adept at being uncomfortable.”

“You are a good son,” Marek said, taking the napkin. “Give your mother my bread.”

“I will steal her bread and not tell her and then go buy an identical loaf,” the policeman said, and left with his dignity arranged like a stack of plates.

“Cobbler,” Sabina said. “Shoes. V-shape scuff. This is the best detective story. Shall I come?”

“Tomorrow we have a hearing,” he said. “Tomorrow you will sit in the back and make faces at people who believe paperwork is a sacrament.” He tucked the napkin into his wallet, where it would whisper to the banknotes about having a purpose. “After, we will go to the cobbler. After, we will go to the river. After, we will ask the city to remember that it is not made of bins but of people who lift lids with respect.”

“You are worse than me for slogans,” she said, delighted. “If you ever run for office I will staple posters but I will not pretend you are tall.”

“I am tall enough to see over a desk,” he said. “And to look a certain man in the eye.”

He slept in his chair that night with his shoes on like a man waiting for something to break. The whisper came again at the back door around three: “Tomorrow,” it said, amused. “Bring your truths. I will bring mine.” He thought: I have more friends than you do. He thought: your truth is a way to get permission to be careless. He thought: if wars are won by supply lines, mine are jars and labels and rope tied to a grandmother’s post.

The morning of the hearing tasted like tin. Zuzana met him on the steps of the municipal building and straightened his collar without touching him, which is a nice trick secrecy teaches you. Inside, a room with a table that had known many elbows. The suits sat like men who wanted very much to be reasonable. The man with the badge. The one with the clipboard. A woman from Legal whose hair had the shellac of ten thousand careful decisions. A representative from OLO with a red tie that said he was trying to be bright. Zuzana sat at the end and folded her hands, palms pressed, as if holding a thought steady so it would not slide off her lap.

“Pán Košík,” the Legal woman began, and he had a brief, disrespectful desire to call her Pani Právnik and see if it gave her a human outline. “We are here to discuss an incident. Fires are serious matters. The site burned. There was a note with your name.”

“I have brought you something,” he said, and put the jar on the table as if it were a vase with a polite flower. “This is what he used to draw his circle. If you like, I can tell you the brand of the lighter he used to set it. I can, if you wish, hum you the tune he hums when he works. I can also show you this.” He laid the copied plan next to the jar. “His plan. The camera angles. He is not careful enough to believe in a secret. He wants witnesses.”

“This is inadmissible,” the legal woman said instinctively, the word ready like a stamp.

“I am not asking you to convict him,” Marek said. “I am asking you not to convict me.”

The man with the red tie looked at the jar. He picked it up. He rolled the grains. They stuck to the side. He looked uncomfortable the way men look when they have found glitter in their eyebrow later and cannot recall where they danced. “Where did you get this?”

“From the ashes of your fire. From his table. From the ground he scuffed with his excellent shoes,” Marek said. He put the napkin on the table last. “Here is the cobbler who will tell you he fixed a V-shape on a heel for a man with money and an accent and a contempt for small talk.”

They did not reach for the napkin. Zuzana did. She read the name, her eyes performing quick arithmetic. The Legal woman had a brief human moment and adjusted a paperclip three unnecessary times.

“What I am,” Marek said, calm, “is a man with a shop that keeps the city from feeling like it has to apologize for surviving. What he is is a man who likes to make diagrams where all the arrows point to him. I repair. He performs. You cannot punish me for not applauding.”

“You have quite a voice,” the badge man said, amused despite himself.

“I have nice jars,” Marek said. “And neighbors. And a woman who cleans for him and saw what he does, and a policeman whose mother knows my mending.”

The Legal woman sighed, and in the sigh was not defeat but the adjustment a mind has to make when a story does not wear its obvious suits. “We will need statements,” she said. “And pieces of paper that say the sorts of things this napkin is trying to say. In the meantime, we can lift the suspension if the evidence you have given us points away. It is not usual. It is what the rules allow when we remember why we wrote them.”

Zuzana looked at him over the jar. She did something with her mouth that was not a smile but was not not one. “See?” she said softly, as if he’d needed a pat from the world.

He left with a promise to bring the cobbler’s words on a thing less vulnerable than a napkin. He left with a temporary lifting. He left with the contact of a reporter he did not want. He left with the knowledge that tonight would be worse. Men like Viliam draw their force from escalation. He would not burn again. He would lay something quieter and meaner. He would make the bins pretend to be wise and then laugh at the people who believed them.

In the afternoon, he and Sabina went to the cobbler. The shop smelled like leather, glue, and a man’s solitude that wasn’t sad. The cobbler had hands you’d give a chair to be touched by. He was nervous until Marek put his own ugly police of the world on the table: kindness, patience, the community of men who keep old things going.

“I can tell you nothing official,” the cobbler said. “But I can tell you that a man came in with a scuff that looked like he had been dancing in a courtyard. The scuff was a V. He did not know how to ask for help. He only knew how to ask for service. He left a smell like peppermint and new battery.”

“Thank you,” Marek said. “We will put your name nowhere.”

“Put my soul nowhere also,” the cobbler said, and smiled apologetically. “I have children who like their father alive.”

They walked from there to the river because Marek needed to see how it held itself in the light. The water had the cold, oily serenity of days when it has decided to keep its warnings to itself. He rested his hands on the rail. He thought of the shorteners. Men who tuck the river. Men who think cutting is a kind of mercy because they like clean edges. He thought of the weirs he had loved as a child, their noise, their lather, the way leaves caught and shivered and then slipped, triumphant. He thought of keys ringing in 1989 and how the city had sat up and breathed. He thought of Sabina next to him texting thirty people a prosím that carried more power than a law.

“We will make a thing,” he said aloud. “Something beautiful. Tonight.”

“What?” she said, warming her fingers on the little life of her phone. “Tell me and I will say it is impossible and then do it.”

“A ribbon,” he said. “From the shop to the bins and back . Glass and wire. Blue and green. Not a trap. A line. We will thread it under their lids so that when he tries to move them, he will have to cut what we make.”

“You want him to have to cut,” she said slowly, catching up, appreciating the ugly cleverness insofar as it made his pride feel less alone. “Because every cut leaves residue.”

“Because every cut is a choice,” he said. “And because the city will see what he cuts.”

“It will also trip old ladies who are not paying attention,” she said dryly, and he loved her for being the practical counsel at the camp of romantic idiots.

“Not a trip,” he corrected. “Low, not at ankle. Eye level for someone meddling. The sort of thing that asks a meddler if he is sure.”

They bought thin wire, the kind jewelers use to pretend metal can be thread. They set out bowls of blue shards and green, and cobbled with patience a thin rope of glass that caught the lamplight and made it deliberate. They anchored it to the shop door and then brought it across to the first bin and to the second, around the hinge, under the lip, not so much as to strangle, but to make holding hands. People stopped. The teenager with the purple skateboard took a photo. Adam from the corner cried, “Pozri!” at a woman who was not looking. Sabina’s tai chi pensioners came and offered knots that would not uglify the wire. Pani Běla arrived and handed around small cups of slivovica as if this were a christening. Men in suits went by and were forced to walk around more slowly than they had intended and learned nothing, but made room.

When they had finished, the ribbon was not functional enough to satisfy the municipal dreams of safety, which meant it was art, and the bins gleamed like drab princesses in borrowed necklaces. Marek stood back, hands on hips, and for the first time in two days felt the small, disobedient lift of joy. It was not much. It was not a law. It was a statement, which is what you call a law when you are nobody.

He did not think it would stop Viliam. He did think it would make him angry. He wanted that. He wanted hard evidence of anger, not cool contempt. Anger left fingerprints you could photograph.

At three in the morning, the whisper came not as a whisper but as the sound of a foot scuffing where no foot had a right to be. He woke as if his bones had alarm clocks in them and slipped into his coat as if it had been waiting. He went down the back stairs, not because he was brave but because sometimes flying stupidly toward the trouble is less unbearable than waiting for it to choose the time. He eased the alley door open. The night had that wet-glassed look cities only have when a tram has just gone by and smoothed the air.

In the front, by the bins, a figure bent. The coat was the right sort of dark. The hair had that clumsy elegance of expensive cuts grown slightly out. The hands were slender and the knife between the fingers looked like a brush about to make a stroke. He was humming. The ribbon caught the light and gave it back, and for the first time in his life, perhaps, Viliam hesitated. Marek watched him decide. He cut.

The sound the wire made when the knife bit it was small. The noise glass made when the cut ran through the line of them was bigger, a quick shiver, like a chorus being told to hush. The knife’s edge collected a smear of blue. It glittered along the blade and made his hand glitter too. He set the knife down and rubbed his fingers together, and the glitter moved to his skin.

“Hello, Viliam,” Marek said, taking the small glory of saying his name aloud in the moment neither of them could pretend they were not there.

Viliam straightened as if his spine were a telescope. He turned his head. He smiled. He had put on a different sort of smile tonight, the kind you wear at the opera when you want to be seen not watching the stage.

“You made jewelry for bins,” he said.

“I made a line you had to break,” Marek said.

“So dramatic,” Viliam murmured, not quite hiding how the glitter discomfited him. “So… ceremonial. The way funerals are.”

“I prefer weddings,” Marek said. “They have better cake.”

“You think you married the street to your sense of order,” Viliam said, and he arched his neck like a swan that has fallen in love with its own shadow. “A romantic move. It will not save you. The city wants me. The city is tired of pretending it can be neat.”

“The city,” Marek said, stepping out into the lamplight, “is tired. That is different from wanting you. It wants rest. I am a good form of rest. You are a hangover.”

Behind them, quietly as breath, four figures rose from the benches, from doorways, from the adopted shadows of familiarity. Adam. A tai chi pensioner whose wrists were still fluid. The teenager with the board. Ondrej, who had exchanged his vest for a jacket but could not leave behind the way he stood as if he were advice and muscle both. Together, not dramatic, they watched.

“Friends,” Viliam said, as if announcing a party. “You do love an audience.”

“You made us one,” Sabina said from where she had made herself part of a doorway, her phone in her hand but her eyes not on it. “Look at your hand.”

He looked. He made a small face. He reached for a handkerchief, realized it would stain, and stopped. He seemed, for that fraction of a second, small. It was beautiful. Marek wanted to keep that image like a pressed leaf.

“You are playing with dust,” Viliam said, regaining his aspect in less than a breath. “While I am playing with the inevitable. Tomorrow the bins downtown will be tipped. The containers on Radničná will be switched. I have friends too. People who are tired. People who enjoy mischief. The city will forget it ever sorted itself. It will relax into its true nature, which is a pile.”

“You,” Marek said, not raising his voice because nothing good lives at the top end of a throat, “are confusing mess with truth. Truth is not a mess. Truth is a clear river that has been given the things it needs to be clear. You are the boy who moves rocks because he cannot bear to think water moves without him.”

“You are the man who imagines you stitch with wires and good intentions,” Viliam said. “We will see which story the city prefers.”

“We will,” Marek said, and stepped forward with his little jar in his hand, the one marked V. Residue. With a motion that was both polite and insulting—like returning a hat you had just seen fall from a horse because the rider had been foolish—he held it out. “You dropped this.”

Viliam’s eyes flicked to the jar. They were truly beautiful, his eyes, and there was nothing he could do about that. Something like a shadow crossed them—annoyance, perhaps; unwillingness to be seen losing. He did not take the jar. He bowed, minutely. “Tomorrow,” he said. “At the river. By the place where tourists go to photograph the propeller and do not know what it once meant. At noon. Bring your jars. Bring your poems. We will see which one floats.”

He turned and walked away, and the glitter on his hand made a trail no camera needed to enhance. The teenager laughed under his breath. Adam whispered: “Kamarát.” Ondrej put his hand briefly on Marek’s shoulder and applied the correct pressure to bring a man back into a body and a street.

Sabina stepped into the space Viliam had vacated and bent to touch the cut glass at the base of the bin. It whispered to her. She smiled, sharp and proud. “He thinks noon will make it dramatic,” she said. “Let’s make it tedious.”

“Tedious,” Marek said, lifting the wire line to keep it from dragging, “is our element.”

They slept a little before dawn, not enough to make sentences, but enough to let the part of a person who is nothing but a quiet animal curl up and shiver less. At ten, they went to the propeller. The propeller sat there by the river like a memory of speed laid on its side. Tourists took photos next to it because someone had told them that they should, and because the river looked like the sort of blue you could take home in a bottle and then be disappointed later when the light did not travel well.

They had brought nothing dramatic. No banners. No jars even, not yet. They brought a bag with sandwiches. They brought a coil of wire and the little bowl of blue. They brought a legal pad. They brought, folded so small it could fit under a coin, the plan he had drawn from the copied plan, but backwards: where he would be if he wanted to be seen by the wrong people. Sabina took out the sandwiches and tore one in half and handed it to Adam, who had insisted on being late because the corner had to be watched. Ondrej stood with his hands in his jacket pockets, a stance that said: I am not on duty, and I am always on duty.

At noon, Viliam arrived. He had chosen a less dramatic coat, which, in some men, is a more dramatic choice. He had a clean handkerchief now. He had polished his shoes. He smiled as if they were all gathered for a christening, which, in some ways, they were.

“Good,” he said. “You are punctual. I appreciate men who respect time.”

“Time is the only thing I have plenty of,” Marek said. “Sometimes the only thing.”

“Let us perform,” Viliam said, as if announcing a duet. He took from his pocket a small object wrapped in tissue. He unwrapped it. It was a glass bottle, tiny, the kind perfume comes in when perfume is a promise in an ad. Inside, a curl of black hair. He rolled it between his fingers. “Do you know this trick?” he asked. “A curse that uses a token. The old ways dressed up for the modern crowd. This one tells the bins to confuse only those who believe in them. It leaves the rest alone. It makes selective chaos. It is elegant. It will make you look like the only man who cannot find his way to the right lid.”

“Hair,” Sabina whispered, close enough for only his ear. “Whose?”

“His own,” Marek guessed, low. “He loves himself enough to be his own talisman.” He stepped forward, and the river caught light like a phrase tossed and caught. “I have a trick too,” he said to Viliam. “It is older and more boring. It is a promise. It is a sentence I make the city say with me.”

He took out nothing. He did not wave his hands. He put his palm flat against the propeller’s cold steel. The steel remembered river, remembered push and churn and the times men had placed it into motion with both reverence and haste. He said, quietly, in his own language and then again in the city’s: “We sort because we love. We separate because we want to be responsible for the putting-back. We do not confuse as a sport.”

The river does not care about ceremonies. It has its own. But it cares about rhythms. It cares about repetition. It cares about men who have put their hands into it to pull a child out. Somewhere along the bank, an old woman threw a piece of bread to a swan and muttered a blessing. Those things collect. They make a quantity that in a mathematics the city knows is nonzero.

Viliam laughed. He uncorked the bottle. He flicked his wrist the way rich boys flick their wrists when they have spent time in front of a mirror practicing not to look weak. The hair fell into the water. It made a small mark, then vanished.

Nothing happened that anyone could sell as a video. The bins along the quay did not dance. A gull cried an opinion. Ondrej sneezed. Adam wiped mustard from his thumb with a leaf and thought about belated dignity.

Then, very slowly, starting not at the bins under their noses but at the corner of Nábrežie where the pensioners liked to sit and be corrected by their own bones, the lids of the glass containers trembled and closed. One after another, a line of courtesy. The blue on Kapucínska settled its little lift. The green on Radničná aligned with its painted square as if obeying a grandmother’s voice. The yellow on the corner, which had been sulking all morning, admitted quietly that it had been dramatic and stopped. It was nothing. It was not enough. It was everything.

Viliam’s mouth tightened. He looked at his knife as if considering whether the knife had failed him or he had failed the knife. He looked at the water with a disdain so clean it would have beveled the edge of a table. “You cannot hold this,” he said. “You cannot hold any of this.”

“I can keep reminding it,” Marek said. “That is my work. That is my boredom. That is my joy.”

“Entropy is honest,” Viliam said, one last time, as if he could bully a truth into liking him.

“Repair is honest too,” Marek said. “It says: I know you will break, and I will be here. It does not pretend to be a god. It is not flashy. It is stubborn. It does not hum.”

He did not expect Viliam to charge, or throw, or cry. He expected him to smile, to leave, to make a call that would inconvenience someone. Men like him rarely break the rules you can see. He was right. Viliam gave a little barman’s nod, the sort you give when you acknowledge you’ve been matched but not beaten. He turned and walked away along the river, his shoulders as if hung on a rod, his left shoe making a little new scuff. He did not look back. The glitter had washed from his fingers.

Sabina exhaled. “That was anticlimactic,” she said, and then realized what she had said and laughed at herself in an affectionate way. “Which is good. I hate climaxes. They make the tidy people cry.”

“Wait for the hearing to become an opera,” Ondrej said. “They will want paperwork to sing.”

“They will get our napkin,” Marek said. “And Marta’s copies. And the cobbler’s quiet. And the jars. And, if necessary, the pensioners’ gossip, which is more accurate than the police most days.”

He sat, suddenly exhausted, on the low wall by the propeller. He let his feet dangle, felt the stone resist his weight the way old stone does—by remembering all the other men and women who have leaned on it out of weariness and been allowed. The city breathed, not more easily, not as a resolution, but in the knowledge that some part of itself had decided to resist contempt. That part was a shop with jars. It was a girl who was not yet resigned. It was a man with a vest who had chosen a side and made it worse for himself and better for everyone else. It was an old woman with a soup spoon as a weapon of choice. It was a policeman who had brought a napkin.

“Tomorrow,” Sabina said, looking at the bright row of bins as if they were her friends at a bus stop, “we fix Pán Karol’s cuckoo. It has been dramatic for too long.”

“Tomorrow,” Marek agreed, and he said it not because he trusted tomorrows but because saying it puts a thin, stubborn thread through the day you are about to enter, and he had found that threads like that do not break as easily as men like Viliam think.

He went back to the shop with a lightness that wasn’t triumph, exactly, but the absence of a certain nausea. He cleaned the glitter from the stoop. He rethreaded the ribbon where it had been cut and tied it with a knot a fisher from Žitný ostrov would have recognized. He wrote in his ledger, in the margin today, and in very small letters: Enemy announced. Allies tend to multiply. He put out the candle he had not lit. He ran his finger along the cobalt and it sang, quietly, like a held glass. He slept, later, in his bed, with his palms up, because there is a way to invite the good weight of sleep, and his grandmother had taught him that too between the names of saints and the best way to make beans forgive you for boiling them.

When he woke, it was to the sound of trams with something like good humor in their scrape and to the blue bin outside, exactly where it should be, doing nothing noticeable at all. It was to a text from Marta that was nothing but a photo of an empty shelf where a plan had been, and under it: He is angrier than you think. It was to a message from Zuzana that said: Fine lifted. Temporarily. Bring the cobbler at four. It was to a scribbled note pushed under the door in a hand that had pressed too hard: My aunt’s clock is ticking like it agreed to live. Thank you.

It was, in other words, to the kind of day that is almost a relief to a man who likes to be bored by beauty. He made tea. He put the mug on the sill. He listened to the river’s old joke. He said, to the kitchen and to the city and to the idea of himself with his hands, “Dobré ráno,” and the mug answered by not leaking. He smiled in the way a man smiles at his own small flamboyances. He opened the door to the shop and he let the bell choose what to sound like, and it chose to sound like something that had always been there and would survive all this, which was the exact sound he needed.By four the municipal building smelled like paper that had learned to put on a suit. Marek climbed the steps with the cobbler beside him, both of them moving in that self-conscious gait men adopt when they know they are bringing something small and true into a room that prefers its truths printed and signed. The cobbler wore his good shirt and had left glue on one knuckle by mistake, which humanized the whole afternoon. Sabina slipped in behind them with her hair tamed into a braid that pretended to be sensible and a tote bag full of everything she imagined a hearing could surprise her with: pens, copies, biscuits, a charger, and a folded square of wire just in case. Zuzana greeted them on the landing with a nod that said she had slept little and had wrung her tiredness into crispness. They filed into the room, which held its fluorescent breath.

The chairs were the kind that squeak when confronted with a conscience. The legal woman with shellacked hair sat at the center and shuffled papers like a card sharp who had renounced sin. The man with the badge and the clipboard man came in a moment later, both performing the government pantomime of being harried and neutral. To one side sat a neat row of empty seats that no one would admit were being saved for the press; the way their emptiness gleamed meant they had been polished that morning with a rag that remembered yesterday’s dust. Marek took his place at the far end, where he could lean his forearms on the table and feel the wood tell him how many elbows had been here before, pleading, protesting, presenting their bits of the world. The cobbler sat and folded his hands, which had more language in them than most mouths.

An observer slid in and made no secret of being a journalist. His pen was the expensive sort that pretends handwriting has a future. He nodded at Zuzana, who returned a look that meant: Please do not turn my day into a headline unless it helps me keep this exact post. Then, as if conjured by a playwright with a poor sense of subtlety, Viliam walked in in a coat that had taught its hem to ignore gravity. He took a seat where he could see everyone and be seen by those who preferred a good jawline to research. He smiled at Marek with a pitiless affection, as if they had shared a summer in a foreign city and were now pretending to be strangers for fun.

The legal woman began in a voice that had been sanded smooth by practice. She laid out the accusation, the fire, the tag with his name, the temporary suspension. She used phrases that wear their official capital letters like hats: Public Safety, Waste Stream Integrity, Enforcement Guidelines. When she was done with the prelude, she lifted her eyes and did the thing she likely prided herself on: she let her voice let some air in. “Pán Košík,” she said, “we have been given certain materials you claim point away from you. Please present your side.”

Marek could have been dramatic. He could have made a little speech about cities and how love is the only real regulation that works. Instead he put the jar on the table gently and placed beside it the copied plan, the printed stills, the napkin with the cobbler’s careful block letters. He spoke like a repairman talking a client through a squeak. He told them about the spiral, the sand that was not sand, the way a lighter’s brand sings to a listener who listens the way he does. He described what he had found in the clock and what his shelves had suffered. He did not say Viliam’s name because he liked the old superstition that names have teeth and he saw no reason to feed this man more breaths with his label in them. When he was done, he let his hands be still.

The legal woman considered the jar as if it might explode. The badge man lifted the plan between finger and thumb and squinted as if the red ink might confess to him personally. Clipboard murmured to himself in the manner of people who adore lists and are trying not to. Zuzana slid the napkin toward herself as if to hide it from bad luck and read it again, though she had already memorized the cobbler’s little shop address.

The cobbler cleared his throat and told them about the V-shaped scuff. He spoke softly and apologized for being a man who kept his head down. He used the word children twice without pathos, which is the only way that word should be used in rooms like this. The journalist’s pen flinched, then kept moving. Sabina, from her seat behind Marek, wrote neatly on her legal pad: We should bake him koláče, and then crossed it out because she knew she would do it anyway and did not need to remind herself to be human.

When it was Viliam’s turn to stand, because of course he would make it his turn, he rose with the grace of a man who knows he looks well from any angle. He did not introduce himself. He spoke as if he were the person in the room who had been told since childhood that his assessment was the room’s diet. “I am a citizen,” he said pleasantly, which is a phrase that can be either a confession or a boast. “I have observed a worrying laxity in our sorting practices. I have also observed a culture of folksy sentimentality around repair that allows certain individuals”—he made a small, regretful gesture that almost included Marek and then withheld him—“to skirt standards. The site burned. There was a name. It is easy to cry conspiracy when confronted by responsibility. I would invite us to be boring instead. The law is clear. Contamination occurred. Suspend. Fine. Then we can all go back to doing our parts.”

“These parts,” Zuzana said, lifting her voice just enough to make the syllables carry to the corners, “include not setting traps at collection points that could have injured staff. You do not need a hearing to know that.” Her eyes did not flinch toward him. She did not give him the kindness of being an opponent. The legal woman wrote something. The journalist’s pen made a satisfying little run of lines like rainfall.

“Traps?” Viliam echoed, and the word was a sweet on his tongue. “We are a superstitious city. A spiral of bottles becomes a curse, a broken jar becomes a trial. It’s charming. It is provincial. I am simply tired of the bins being treated like altar-pieces. They are bins. Put things in. Empty them. Repeat.”

The cobbler, who had not meant to be brave today, said, “Then why do your hands shine blue?” His voice had the clean tone of men who say only necessary things. Viliam glanced down at his palm very briefly and did not give them the courtesy of changing expression. He put both hands flat on the table so they could all admire how beautifully considered they were and then folded them again as if to keep their secrets.

The legal woman did a thing that made Marek like her without wanting to: she asked for a recess. She had them all stand and go drink water in the hall. She sat by herself with the jar, the copies, the napkin, and her neat hair, and did a fast internal arithmetic. Marek went to the window and looked at the old chestnut tree in the courtyard and let his heartbeat settle. Sabina pressed a biscuit into the cobbler’s hand and the cobbler hid it in his pocket because he had grown up poor enough to feel shame at being given sweets. Zuzana checked her phone and typed quietly to someone above her in an office that smelled like toner and sullen carpets: We can lift. We can protect ourselves in writing. We can start watching the sites properly. Please let me be practical and not political. The response, three dots, then: Do it. But do not become a story.

They reconvened. The legal woman said what cities say when they are being their better selves, which is to say, she said they were lifting the suspension provisionally, pending further investigation, pending statements, pending the kind of paperwork that makes timid people brave. She said they would accept the evidence as evidence. She said one sentence that would become a small talisman in Marek’s mouth, rolling there to be tasted on sour days: “We appreciate the difference between repair and deceit.”

The relief that moved through Marek was not theatrical. It was a loosening at the hinge of the jaw and a permission given to his shoulders to drop a fraction the way a bird allows its wings to angle down when it has decided the wind can do the work for two beats. He turned his head and met Viliam’s gaze and let his own be boring, the way patience can be quite insulting if you do it with skill. Viliam’s mouth flexed around an almost-smile that kept its teeth. He tipped his chin a millimeter. He looked at the journalist with the expression of a man ordering a drink he knows will be comped. He left the room first and let the door shut on a draft of coolness.

Outside, in the late afternoon, the street was briefly warmer than the season permitted. People took off their hats foolishly and then put them back on. The cobbler accepted the biscuit at last and bit into it with the solemnity of a man in a religious painting receiving bread. He shook Marek’s hand and Sabina’s and then, because he had learned the right lessons from fear, walked away in a direction that took him three blocks out of his way and saved nothing but face.

They went back to the shop and opened the grate with the extravagant satisfaction of rightness that had been withheld and returned. Adam yelled something at them about news and important people and then laughed because he knew they did not like to be called that. The ribbon of glass still linked bin to bin and caught the light as if it had decided to be a tame piece of river. Someone had tucked a note into the wire above the blue lid. It had been written by an elderly hand in careful block letters and said: THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT PRETTY. WE LIKE PRETTY. WE ARE OLD, NOT DEAD. Sabina held it to her chest like a medal and then taped it behind the counter.

Work came in small, lovable waves. A child with a toy dump truck whose hinge had learned the wrong lesson from life and had begun to sag. A man with a cane that had a secret compartment his wife did not know about in case he decided to surprise her with a ring he had not yet been able to afford to buy. A teapot with a lid that insisted on leaping like a fish. He sutured each with the appropriate combination of wire, epoxy, words, and listening. He told the dump truck that engineers do not mind being outsmarted by toddlers but prefer hinges that keep their promises. He told the cane that secrets and balance are not contradictions. He told the teapot that leaping is for rivers and lids alike, but that kettles like loyalty. He laughed at himself for being ridiculous and did it anyway because ridiculous kindness has a rate of return the city understands.

Just after dusk, as Sabina was writing out instructions for a woman who had brought in a shattered fruit bowl and had left saying she would come back with a cake for them to ruin and then fix, a message hummed into his phone. Marta. It was a photo. The shelf in Viliam’s flat was empty where the plan had been. The caption read: He noticed. Anger is a heavy object. He threw a glass at the wall and apologized to his floor. I am careful. Then a second message: He left in walking-quick coat. To the river. To the small gate. You know the one. He took rope and that stupid book. Marek tasted the old word in his mouth like iron: weir. Shortener. Little gate. He did not even need to speak; Sabina was already shrugging on her coat.

They crossed the square in that not-quite-run that gets you places without frightening pensioners. The river had gone dark and sleek in the cold. Bratislava wears its lights like a necklace it thinks is too much and cannot stop touching, which is to say the reflections trembled on the water with a vanity Marek forgave. The small gate was a place he had known since boyhood, where the Danube sends a thin arm to touch the old teeth of industry. It had ironwork that had been painted thirty seasons over, and under the paint the rust was doing its slow, honest work. Tonight, that gate was awake. He could hear its hinge remembering being forced the wrong way.

They found him in the half-shadow with his coat off and his sleeves rolled like a recipe for charm. He had a rope looped around the gear that lifts the sluice. He had the diary open at a page where the old mourner of rivers had sketched a way to “tame the impatience” of a stream with a half-gate. He hummed and his breath came white. He looked up at them and did not stop tying. He said, brisk and cheerful, “I knew you would come. I brought an audience for my lesson. The city will learn to like me if I educate her.”

“You are going to move water with rope and arrogance,” Sabina said, and did not bother to let her disdain be elegant. “This is exactly the thing we warn schoolchildren against in the science center.”

“This is not science,” he said, which was his whole thesis more than he knew. “This is taste. The river lacks it. I am providing.”

Marek did not step toward him first. He stepped toward the gear and placed his palm on it and greeted it with the respect you pay the stubborn. The iron told him the last man who had cared for it had died and had not been replaced properly. The new man was good at forms and wore gloves too often. The gear remembered one night in 2002 when a boy and a girl had kissed and the boy, dizzy with the power of being kissed, had put his hand on the wheel and spun it one quarter turn and both of them had laughed at how the water answered. It remembered a winter when the ice had bullied it and a summer when the sand had whispered through its teeth. It remembered it did not like being dragged.

“Stop,” Marek said, not to Viliam but to the iron, which is the sort of absurd magic that sometimes works when everything in a scene is tired of being reasonable. He spoke the word in a handful of languages because iron is cosmopolitan. He felt the wheel stiffen under his hand and grow millimeters heavier. He shifted his weight and gave it the weight of a life spent not letting the wrong things turn.

Viliam’s smile went brittle. He tugged the rope and the rope obeyed its desire to be rope and tightened. The wheel obeyed its desire to be a wheel and held. Sabina stepped behind him and took the knife from her pocket. She had put it there because she is a practical girl in a city that asks young women to carry tools. She slid the blade between rope and gear and flicked. The rope hiccuped and slumped in a sulk to the ground. Viliam let out a breath that would have been a growl if he were less committed to elegance.

“You plan to tangle the river in ribbons too?” he asked, and the words were meant to sting, but he had not learned that there are certain insults that only please the insulted.

“We plan to let it do what it likes with less of you in the way,” Sabina said, and because she wanted to ruin him in a way that would bruise his sense of being special, she added: “You are a cliché.”

He laughed and reached into his coat pocket and took out something small, which he dropped. It clinked. Marek bent on instinct and picked it up. A little sliver of metal shaped like a U. Not steel. Not iron. A cheap alloy that had been through enough pockets to smell like everyone's lint. It wanted to be useful. It had not learned how. He put it in his own pocket without asking permission from any gods; not all relics deserve shrines.

“Even if you had turned it,” Marek said, voice low because the dark loves low voices, “the water would have punished someone who does not know how to read its face. Likely not you. Likely a person downstream with a pram and the gift of distraction. Repairmen are not more moral than other men, Viliam. We are simply better at being scolded by consequence.”

“You are full of aphorisms,” he said, stepping closer as if proximity could autopsy them. “It is charming. It is provincial. The difference between us is that I am not in love with the idea of community. I am interested in correct arrangements.”

“The difference is that mine can be taught,” Marek said. “Yours cannot. You make a trick and then go home. We make a habit and then sleep.”

Something in him wanted to tell a story he had not told in twenty years. He did not know why the edge of the gear pressing into his palm felt like the right listener. Maybe because the only way to beat an argument is to tell the truth in a place that will remember it without writing it down wrongly. He said, in one piece like a man who had practiced not thinking between sentences: “I cut my hand when I was twenty because I thought I could suture a bird. A pigeon's wing, broken. I said the words and felt the bones and decided I was kind enough to be allowed. It mended wrong. It was worse pain because it had hope in it. My grandmother made me sit for hours and listen to the pestle in the mortar and not speak. She said: we do not stitch living things unless they ask and unless we are sure that the asking is theirs and not ours. She said: you may put your pride into jars and lock the lids when you are tired of hearing it rattle. I still hear it. I hear it right now. It’s an ugly sound. And I am saying this not for your benefit but to remind the iron what I mean when I say stop.”

Sabina looked at him sideways, not with pity but with the recalibration admiration requires sometimes. Viliam smiled with his mouth and not his eyes and sighed. “You will not let me play with the river,” he said. “You will not let me play with your bins. Fine. Tomorrow I will play with your papers. I will arrange your permits in the wrong drawers. I will move your signage. I will send you inspectors who cannot spell their own department. I will call entropy’s cousin bureaucracy and drink to your boredom.”

He left with his rope like a defeated ribbon. The wheel under Marek’s hand relaxed a fraction as if its own muscles had unclenched. He patted it because he is a foolish man who likes to pet objects when they do well, and Sabina made a noise that meant she would tease him about it for weeks. They stood by the sluice for a while and watched the water take its time. The diary—Marek had tucked it into his coat as easily as men lock a drawer with their hip—warmed against his side. He would read it again tonight and see if the old river man had written anything useful between the lines for a century he had not met.

On the way back, they passed a wall blackened by last winter's graffiti and this summer’s attempt at renovation. Someone had written UNSORT YOURSELF in a rehearsed hand and a different someone had drawn a big arrow under it pointing at a public bin. Under that, in tiny letters, someone had written: Or stay sorted; it is free. Sabina laughed in a way that made her breath look like speech. They turned up Kapucínska and saw the ribbon gleam and the blue lid sitting in its place like a dog on its mat. The city breathed. It did not sing a hymn of unity. It performed its evening choreography with less hesitation than the night before, which is as much as you can ask of any system made of people going home.

He slept on his back like a man who trusts the ceiling to do its job. At dawn he woke to another text from Marta: He stayed up and did not hum. He cut paper. He folded it. He smiled the way men smile when they have discovered a lever. He kissed his mirror. Be careful today with the kind of doors that use printer ink to open. He sent back a thank you that felt insufficient and was the only currency he had to offer at that hour.

At ten, in the shop, a man brought in a suitcase with a handle that wobbled and a sadness that would have flooded the room if sadness had elbows. He explained in broken sentences that the suitcase had belonged to his son, who was now gone to Vienna, to a life where he would marry a person the father had not met. He wanted to send the suitcase after him, but it had the wrong wobble. Could the wrong wobble be corrected. Yes, Marek said, with the gravity wobble deserves. He let his hand rest on the leather and felt all the train platforms it had stood on, and the one bus window where a child had drawn a heart in condensation and then written the first letter of a name next to it and the father had pretended not to see and had seen and had not forgotten. He tightened a screw and whispered a promise to it and set it back in place until the handle remembered what straight felt like.

In the afternoon, as thunder gathered in a scatter of distant remarks and then decided to be coy, Zuzana came with a folder that had an expression. She set it on the counter as if it might jump. Inside was a printed directive from an office higher than hers, an office that likely smelled like a combination of lavender hand sanitizer and fear. It ordered the immediate inspection of all “non-licensed magical repair services,” a phrase that is not a thing until it is printed on a line with a stamp and then becomes a thing that can swallow hours. The list attached was wrong in three places and right in six. It had Marek’s shop, a man in the market who mended umbrellas and swore at them without saying words that frightened children, an old woman who made charms against indigestion in a kitchen that had never ceased to steam in seventy years, and a student who mended bicycle chains in a yard and, according to the list, therefore required compliance certification.

“They sent it to me first,” Zuzana said, and her mouth did a tight, handsome thing. “Which is either a test or a way of giving me a little rope with which to hang myself. I am supposed to put these in motion. I will put some in motion. I will delay others. You will get a visit. You will be annoyed. Do not shout at the person who comes. He will be a child. He will have a form. He will have a mother who believes he is doing something useful.”

“This is his new thing,” Sabina said, and fed her righteous annoyance into the group chat where it could be metabolized into lists and shifts for people to sit politely with clipboards and offer biscuits to inspectors until the inspectors forgot whose idea it had been to bother anyone and just stayed for tea. “If he cannot move bins without cutting his hands, he will move lines on paper.”

“He knows my one vulnerability,” Marek said. “My respect for lines.” He lifted the folder and weighed it as if weight could be a unit of pettiness. “We will meet them with chairs and patience. And we will start something less polite.”

“What?” Sabina asked, which she always did at the right time.

“An evening,” he said. “In the square. Bring your broken things. Watch us fix them. Watch us fail and try again. Watch the way hands work when they are not taking, not arranging, but returning. Call it a sorting of sorts. Put out bowls. Put out ribbon. Put out the old lady who can whisper a charm into a stomach and make it stop telling lies. Let them see how untidy and how necessary this all is.”

“That is an event,” Pani Běla said from the doorway because she always arrived at the part of the story where her lines would be best. She held two posters under her arm, blank and begging. “I will write it on paper people do not know how to throw away. I will put a coffee stain in one corner so it looks like it has already survived something.”

Ondrej came at six with a bag of cable ties and a look of a man who believes he has finally found a use for cable ties that isn’t humiliating. Adam brought a megaphone and the humility to let it sit unused if the evening stayed kind. The teenager with the purple skateboard chalked arrows on the pavement pointing to nowhere in particular because he liked watching people decide to turn. Marta did not come because some kinds of bravery have to be quiet, but she sent a friend who stood by the edge and watched with the concentration of a person learning how to defect from a small, private regime.

They strung lights and put out tables that had never looked so serious. People came with their breakages like gifts. A man with a lamp whose cord had learned to despise being cord and had become, on principle, a snake that bit. A girl with a hair clip her grandmother had worn in a photograph and that had snapped at the hinge the morning of a test. An old man with a radio that had broadcast the hockey in 2002 and had been quiet since. Marek and Sabina and three pensioners with sewing kits and a boy who knew how to solder but not how to make eye contact and a woman who did calligraphy for a living and for therapy and for nothing at all sat and worked under the watching eyes of people who are rarely allowed to see how their systems are repaired.

It was messy. It was slow. Things broke again, in smaller ways. Glue refused to cure when the wind flirted wrong. Someone knocked a jar and glittered their shoes and had to be given a brush. People laughed and then remembered they had been told not to in buildings with hearing rooms and laughed again louder. Viliam did not show up. That was fine. He would hear about it in the way men like him hear about human events: as rumors that must be owned or erased. The press came late and took photographs of hands and tried to make candles look like politics. The legal woman passed through in a coat she used to become her off-duty version and bought a tea from a volunteer and said nothing and left a donation by pretending she had mistaken a jar for a rubbish bin.

When it was over they left the square cleaner than they had found it, but not insultingly so; a scrap of ribbon escaped under a bench and made a child’s evening tomorrow; a man picked up a bolt and put it in his pocket because he believed in hardware. Marek locked the shop with the kind of tired that garners no attention from sleep because sleep recognizes its own.

He woke to rain and to a knock that sounded like two fingers and a bad attitude. The inspector was indeed a child, or might as well have been. He had a name that tried to be bigger than he was and a jacket that belonged to his older brother. He held a form the size of a placemat and a pen that had already failed him three times today. Marek offered him tea. The boy refused because refusing is free. Marek sat him down anyway and explained his jars, his labels, his shelves. He did not perform. He did not charm. He was himself. The boy tried to be bored. He failed. He asked questions. He asked what happens when people bring anger in with their broken chair. He asked if words do anything. He asked what happens to the bits they sweep up.

“They go back into the small river,” Marek said, and explained glass dust and how the city is a composite material and why you do not throw everything away at once or at all. “We keep the bits that remember. We let them tell us how to put similar bits back where they belong. It is listening with your fingers.”

The boy wrote: Listening with fingers. He looked startled at himself and crossed it out and then rewrote it smaller. He stood and shook Marek’s hand, which is not on any form. He left with nothing except a biscuit wrapped in paper that would end up as a story his girlfriend would tell her sister. Zuzana texted an hour later: He listed you as compliant and “peculiar in a good way.” I will frame it for my office. He laughed and then did not because the next text was from Marta and read: He has begun to call City Hall. He is charming in a way that is not expensive for him and expensive for us. He is saying words like fairness and consistency. He has a list and your name wears a ring around it.

He put his hand flat on the counter because that made everything easier to think through. He looked at Sabina, who had ink on her fingers and someone else’s problem written on her forehead, and at his shelves, which knew how to withstand both heat and bureaucracy if asked correctly. He was not a soldier. He was not a politician. He was a suturer with a city’s ear and a stubborn apprentice and a ribbon running from his door to the blue-lidded bin as if to remind him, every time he looked up, that you can link what you love with something that will gleam even when the day does not. He took a breath and let it out slowly, and somewhere down by the river the gulls swore and the old men on the bench nodded at something invisible and the tram said the name of the stop like a blessing.Chapter 8 began with rain that came down like handwriting—confident at first, then hurried, then smudged. It wrote on the streets and the tram roofs and on the blue lid of the bin outside Marek’s shop until the lid shone with a damp that made it look more expensive than it was. He came in holding his umbrella like a well-behaved pet and shook it over the mat, listening to the little drumroll of water on rubber. The shop met the weather the way it met everything else, by adjusting its breath. He lit the kettle because the morning had the taste of paper, and paper tastes better in the company of steam.

By nine, the first person to arrive was not a client but Zuzana, her hair making its own argument with the air. She came in with a folder the way a person afraid of dogs comes into a room with a dog, which is to say prepared to pretend friendship while expecting a sudden move. She did not sit. She stood in front of his counter and held the folder as if it might leak. “We have a problem,” she said, and the words had already been too often in her mouth today. “The city’s stamp is missing.”

Marek put his cup down so gently the saucer applauded. There are objects you can lose and expect to get by with a lie, and there are objects you cannot. The Great Seal of Bratislava—a brass circle with a grip polished by the hands of clerks, a red pad in a tin, a lid that squeaked in a way that warned you to be serious—did not go missing. It stayed, if not where it belonged, then where it had been put, like a decent ancestor. “Stolen?” he asked. He felt foolish the instant he used the simple word for a complicated act. Stolen means fingers, pockets, a man looking left and right. This would have been a theft of a different family.

“Borrowed without the city’s consent,” Zuzana corrected, and he liked her more for the accuracy. “I came in this morning and the box was there, but the weight was wrong. The pad smelled different. There is… a smudge on the blotter. Whoever took it stamped something with it. Maybe twice. Maybe ten times. I do not know yet.”

Sabina, who had a gift for standing in rooms as if there were hidden strings she could make visible by focusing hard enough, leaned in and inhaled. “The ink smells wrong,” she said. “Synthetic. Sharp. Like a marker that thinks it’s a perfume.”

Zuzana nodded. “We will be showered in papers. ‘Official.’ ‘Urgent.’ We have no stamp. He has… a stamp.” Her eyes were underlined by tiredness and by a civic embarrassment she refused to let turn into shame. “And he has friends who like to carry clipboards because it makes them feel safe. He will direct them. They will direct us. The bins will be given orders that pretend to be law.”

Marek took the folder and peeked. Inside lay a blurry photo of the blotter—the ghost of a circle that had been pressed without enough ink and a corner of red fiber caught in a wrinkle. Next to it, a photocopy of a notice that had already begun to appear taped to containers along the promenade: TEMPORARY OUT OF SERVICE. CONSOLIDATE TO NEAREST COLLECTION POINT. In smaller type, a sentence that offended him more than the capitals did: Thank you for your patience as we improve your compliance experience. He hated the word experience on paper. It had no right to be there.

“Who kept the stamp?” he asked. “Who kept it yesterday?”

“Old Hronec used to touch it every day,” Zuzana said. “He retired two summers ago to a flat in Petržalka with a bird named after a footballer. He taught me to press it without smearing. Since he left, it lives in a drawer in a room with too many keys. It is supposed to be signed out. The signatures are correct. The times are wrong.”

“Meaning someone learned to sign the way a stamp would if it had fingers,” Sabina said, as much to savor the phrase as to believe in the mechanism.

“We need to get ahead of this,” Zuzana said. “If he makes a thing official, even if it is nonsense, people will obey. Some out of habit, some out of fear, some out of laziness. A city can survive malice; laziness is the quicker flood.”

“Then we find Hronec,” Marek said. “We ask a man who loved a stamp what the stamp does when it doesn’t love the hand that holds it.”

They took the bus because there is no better way to think about a city than to share a seat with its moist umbrella ghosts and their conversations about nothing that is secretly everything. Petržalka, in rain, looks like a lesson in geometry written in a beautiful hand by a teacher who hates drawings. The blocks rose, repeated, and then admitted their variations to anyone who bothered to look: a balcony with a plant that had grown rebellious; a curtain with a pattern from East Germany; a graffito done by a man who had loved someone with a name that did not survive their fight. They found Hronec’s bell by the way the paint around it had been polished by hopeful fingers over years. He answered with a cough and a hello that had fruit in it. Behind him, on a perch near the kitchen window, a parakeet with the expression of a retired inspector cocked its head.

“You have come to confess you lost what you shouldn’t,” he said, which must be what men who loved stamps consider a greeting.

“We have come so you can tell us how to find it,” Zuzana said, and sat at the little table with decency while he made tea without anyone asking him to.

Hronec had hands that still bore a faint circle from where the stamp’s handle had sat for decades. He held them under the light as if to consult them. “Do you know why we have a seal?” he asked, not to be a professor but to remind himself he was not just a man with a bird.

“To make things real,” Sabina said, then added, “Or to allow us the illusion of reality.”

“To remind paper that it is not alone,” Hronec said, smiling. “That there is a room and a person and a sequence that led to this mark. We used to tie the seal to the ledger with a red ribbon. The ribbon was not to keep anyone from taking it. A ribbon can be cut. It was to remind the seal that it belonged to a sentence. We stopped tying it. We put it in a drawer. So now it belongs to a drawer.”

Marek liked him more every minute. “Can you show me the ribbon knot?” he asked.

Hronec held up his right hand and tied an invisible knot in the air. It was a small loop and a twist, then through, then the tail tucked back along the line. It was the kind of knot that looked unserious but would never betray you if the rope agreed to be rope. “You tie it this way,” he said. “You whisper this very stupid rhyme so your mouth won’t wander. You always press the seal on the ribbon once before you press it on anything else. So it remembers its first commitment.”

“Who taught you that?” Sabina asked, her face saying she already loved the answer.

“My first boss,” he said. “Who learned it from a woman who had survived three sets of rules by never letting the seal go to bed thinking it was a god.”

There are many kinds of magic. Some ask for better candles. Some ask for a bowl of water and a match. Some ask you to tie a knot and say a stupid rhyme because the stupid rhyme keeps you from thinking you’re conducting a symphony when you’re only trying to tell paper it has to wear a hat. Marek let his fingers memorize the knot. He would teach it to Sabina later on a piece of string that had once been part of a parcel from the countryside. For now, he asked, “If you were a seal that had been mishandled, where would you go?”

“I would go to the place where doors open without people,” Hronec said, and the bird, as if to underline his wit, preened elaborately. “The archive. The room with the false shelf. Room Twelve, that is really Ten-and-a-half. You need a key that is not a key, a piece of metal that pretends to be a U. They stopped using it when I was still a boy. If someone found it, they would think it junk or a joke. It opens the glass.”

Marek took from his pocket the little metal U he had picked up at the sluice gate last night. He put it on the table between the teacups. It lay there, not proud, but content to be at least discussed by people who would not throw it away. Hronec looked at it and laughed until the parakeet scolded him. “Yes,” he said, wheezing a little. “Yes. He is not original, your mischief-maker. He is attentive. There is a difference.”

When they left, the rain had slackened into a conscientious drizzle. They went to the municipal building not by the front steps with the idea of republic carved into them, but around the side, where the deliveries come and where the building reveals it has a back and not only a face. Zuzana led them down a corridor lined with framed photographs of men shaking hands with other men, the frames themselves not quite level because whoever had hung them had understood the necessity of the gesture and not the pleasure. Room Twelve’s door had a small label that had been printed by a machine that believed itself an oracle. The keyhole was honest and uninterested. The glass cabinet inside was locked. The lock was not a lock. It was a memory of a lock that required the key to agree not to be a key. Marek slid the U into the slot and felt the mechanism remember its own youth. It opened with a sigh that had held still inside its little throat for thirty years.

The seal was not on its velvet. A faint ring of dust marked where it had sat long enough to impress the glass. The ink pad’s lid lay askew in the way of lids that have been put back by hands that do not care for lids. There was a red fiber in the hinge. There was a note under the blotter that said, in a handwriting he knew well enough to make his teeth clench, Everything is permitted to those who enforce. He put that note in his pocket, not because the court would love it but because his rage wanted something to fold.

They did not find the seal there. They found evidence of its absence, which is one of the few satisfactions bureaucracy ever gives. On their way out, in the hall, a young man with a badge so new it might have still smelled like factory air pretended to check an inventory and pretended not to watch them. Sabina smiled deliberately at his pretense. The young sometimes notice the mercy you give them with the precision of thirst.

By noon, the notices had begun to appear like mushrooms on the city’s surfaces. Dogs and bins are the first to be told what to do in any crusade. White paper with a red circle in the corner and text as bland as milk commanded streets to unlearn their habits. TEMPORARY OUT OF SERVICE meant little hills forming next to lids and the lids developing the tired look they get when used as tables. CONSOLIDATE TO NEAREST COLLECTION POINT meant someone else’s doorstep. He could feel the resentment blooming like damp in the walls.

Marta texted a photograph that had been taken with a phone that knew how to be discreet: Viliam at his kitchen table, a portable printer the size of a large book humming, sheets sliding out like little sins, his hand guiding each page with the tenderness of a man who loves weapons. Under the photo, her message: He printed twenty. He practiced the stamp. He cursed at ink for the first time. He called it messy. He went into the bathroom and came out with a towel he has never used and used it on the stamp. It made a satisfying noise when it lifted. He smiled. He likes things that reward him for being obvious.

“He has it,” Zuzana said, staring at the photo until it could not deny its truth. “He has it and he is stamping like an idiot.”

“He is stamping like a person who believes no one will check where the ribbon is tied,” Marek said. “So we will give the city a ribbon. We will tie it to the bins. We will tie it to the door of your office. We will tie it to the old woman who eats pickled peppers at the corner and yells at cars. We will make a stamp that is not a stamp and we will teach people the word they need in order to recognize fakes.”

“You want to invent a stamp?” Sabina said, delighted. “Blasphemy. I’m in.”

“Not a stamp,” he said. “A counter-mark. Something the city can teach itself. It will be beautiful and slightly unnecessary. That is the only way to make a city love it.”

That afternoon, while Zuzana went to argue with men who had never said the word ribbon without meaning corruption, and while Ondrej put his vest back on and began moving through collection points like a man who has been asked by a friend to stand at her shoulder at a wedding and glower at anyone who coughs during the vows, Marek and Sabina prepared their little blasphemy. They made ink the old way, with soot from a candle, with a drop of vinegar, with a teaspoon of sugar, with a shaving of cobalt like a secret ingredient in a stew a grandmother will never admit to and will never forget to add. They mixed it with water from the jar on the counter that had once held pickles so that the ink would remember what it is to brine and to preserve. They found an old brass die in the back room—part of a logo from before the Velvet Revolution when the shop had been called by his grandfather's name alone and had pretended that the state loved it more than the state loved itself. He polished the brass until it recognized itself. He did not carve the city’s arms, because theft is theft even when done on the side of angels. He carved into the brass something else: a little knot and a tiny lid, a loop with its tail tucked under.

“What is it?” Sabina asked, turning it under the lamp.

“A reminder,” he said. “That a thing is sealed to something besides itself. Seat this on ribbon and touch it to the hinge of a lid, and anyone who knows the knot will know that someone who understands the stupid rhyme put this here. It is not law. It is gossip that intends to become law by behaving better than law.”

They stamped three ribbons and let them dry. They walked down to the bins and tied the first one between blue and green, right at eye height for someone who meddles. Pani Běla appeared as if stirred by a personal sense of trouble and held the knot while he spoke the rhyme under his breath. She made him say it aloud, because grandmothers do not allow you the modesty of quiet when you are in fact doing something respectable. The words were nonsense about lids and loops and how they remember being touched. He stamped the knot and there, in the red circle, the tiny loop and the tiny lid lasted with an authority that did not read as official to the part of the brain that loves hats, but did read as right to the part that loves cupboards and the idea of things being where you left them.

They taught the pensioners the knot by pretending the knot had been their idea in the first place. Two boys on bikes rolled up, laughed, and then got serious, the way boys do when they are allowed to hold string in public. They filmed Marek’s hands, and the video later would make the rounds, not as a viral moment but as the kind of minor, durable practicality that men send each other at midnight when their wives have gone to bed and they are feeling loyal to something for reasons they could not say. The journalist came and tried to make it angrier. It refused. The ribbons looked good in the rain.

By evening, notices with the fake stamp had begun to curl at the corners, the cheaper paper admitting its poverty. People read them and then looked for the knot. If the knot was there, the notice got ignored. If the knot was not there, a hand—Adam’s, Sabina’s, some girl who worked at the post office, an old lady with a cane—went up and pulled the paper down and used it to wrap a cigarette filter and get away with something it did not deserve. The city taught itself to ignore things. That is a skill as dangerous as believing everything, but today it was medicine, and they had no time to write dosage instructions.

That night, the papers arrived anyway, dropped from somewhere higher than a lamppost, cliché as rain. Someone—who other than Viliam would have thought the trick seemed witty instead of exhausted?—had turned a terrace into a mouth and given it leaflets to spit. Thank you for your patience, the papers said, and they made a little sound like insults hitting roofs. Sabina, who had the night in her legs still from the previous night’s sluice, looked up and saw, just for a second, the twiddle of a small mechanical hand tossing the sheets over and over with an obedience that had been paid for in money and not love. “He has built a spitter,” she said, not without reluctant admiration. “He found a toy, and now my whole street is snow.”

Marek put his palms on the brick. Brick keeps grudges longer than concrete. It remembered a drill yesterday, a hole where there had not been one since the wall was rebuilt, a small bracket with no dignity. They found it—Bolted. Wired. A schoolboy’s project done with a surgeon’s attention. Sabina cut the wire with the knife that had been in her pocket since she had decided that a certain man existed in her city and that tools would be necessary. The spitter wheezed and surrendered a last page. They took it out and set it on the counter in the shop as if to forgive it. Marek felt the little gears in his fingertips. They had been made by a man in a factory in the Czech Republic who had hummed, not like Viliam, but like a person who hummed because humming kept his hands from shaking when he thought about his mother and her pills. He apologized to the gears for their involvement. They have nothing to do with any of this, he thought, and he hated a little more the man who brought other men’s work into his games.

Morning made the notices limp. Morning made the ribbons pretty. Morning, for once, forgave them all for loving what they loved. Then, because a city cannot be persuaded to let you have a single day of one kind, a letter arrived with Marek’s name in a ring. The letterhead wanted to be more important than it was, which is a sin paper can sometimes forgive. The language was correct in a way that made it more wrong. INSPECTION OF NON-LICENSED MAGICAL ENTERPRISES, it declared again, in better fonts now, with a date that could be read upside down as something reasonable. He would have had to close for a week while a committee considered what he was, as if a rooster had to wait for a permit before the morning could exist. He put the letter on the shelf between a porcelain dog and a mason’s level and looked at it the way a doctor looks at a wart. Then he called the only person in the building who cared about her hair and her soul with equal precision.

“Bring it,” Pani Právnik said, and when he lifted the counter and went to the municipal building he found her waiting in a white blouse that had resisted all the grub of the day. “Let me see the teeth,” she said, and he enjoyed hearing someone in that building say the word with respect.

She read and snorted, the sound of a beautiful horse refusing a jump. “They have stolen my tone,” she said. “We all have tones. They are tools. I do not lend mine. This is written by someone who knows how to braid a sentence so that it looks harmless and strangles you if you nod while it goes around your neck. He calls me conservative when I am kind. He calls me radical when I am careful. He is a politician’s favorite kind of clerk.”

“A murderer’s favorite kind of law,” Marek said, meaning the sort that thinks its own virtue will keep its hands from finding knives.

“We can respond,” she said, and her voice found the pitch that makes other officials adjust their pens without knowing why. “We can—what is the word your apprentice loves?—crowdsource a counter.” She pulled a form out of nowhere because some women are conjurers and some offices are blessed with them. “This is a memorandum an office sends to itself when it needs to tell itself it is wrong without saying sorry. I will write it. You will bring your ribbons. We will attach them. We will make this whole farce look like a charade. And do not correct me: it is a charade. I do not need your poets to tell me so. I have lived long enough to recognize dresses borrowed from nobility on girls who despise laundry.”

He loved her then in the way you can love a woman in a blouse who knows more about mercy than anyone who has ever lit a candle for a saint with a sword. He helped her choose words that would be too plain to be airbrushed into someone else’s rhetoric. She allowed him to add one phrase that pushed at the line of poetry and then forgave it for not bringing flowers when it came over: Repair is a public good when it shows its stitches. They stamped the memorandum with a stamp that was not the seal. It was a rubber thing with a date and the name of her department, and it wore its lack of grandeur with grace. She tied a ribbon around it, loop through tail, and he stamped the knot. The small loop and the small lid winked at him. He imagined Viliam seeing that wink and needing to knock something off a shelf just to feel superior.

It was not enough. It was never enough. Enough does not exist for people like him. It was, however, sufficient to outlast that day’s onslaught. The inspectors came with their pens, but they were also people who had been children, who had been carried in buses, who had watched a grandfather fix a toaster without throwing it away. They drank Marek’s tea and asked him about his jars and wrote down the stupid rhyme as if it were in their manual. Sabina sat with one and explained tenderness like a metric. She did not use that word; she does not like it when tenderness becomes a noun in a girl’s mouth; she turned it into verbs: wipe, align, forgive, remind. On their way out, two of them took ribbons with stamps on them “for their grandmothers,” which was a phrase that covered everything they wanted and could not quite ask for.

In the afternoon, Ondrej called him to the river not because there was a fire or a trap but because there was a thing that had been made wrongly and could be unmade gently. “Bring your apprentice,” he said. “Bring your stupid rhyme.” They went, carrying string and patience, and found at the small gate a knot that had begun to pull a gear in a way that made the gear angry. It was a knot done with competence and spite. It had no mercy in it, only certainty. It was, Sabina said, the kind of knot a boy learns from a book when he does not have a grandfather to teach him how to tie a boat and talk about potatoes. She put her fingers to it and made a face, as if she had bitten into something respectable and found greed. They loosened it slowly, not because the rope was delicate but because the gear appreciated the courtesy, and courtesy is sometimes the only difference between defeat and a day you can live with. When they had the rope free, the sluice sighed in the way of machinery when someone has touched it right. He had the thought, not original, that sometimes the city was a person you had to hold the shoulder of while you told it the decisions it had already made.

Night came early, as it does when rain has a bureaucracy of its own and comes to you with forms to be filled in. The ribbon between the bins had been touched by twenty hands and now had the look objects get when they have been loved by a neighborhood. It had a stain that would never come out. It had a knot that had been retied by a man with fat fingers and a laugh that had a cough inside it. It had his tiny stamp that did not look like power and therefore had an effect power never achieves, which is to say: it made people kind without asking them to say it aloud.

Marta texted again at midnight, a timestamp that would be impolite if she had been asking for money or attention, but was simply a gift, and you do not scold a woman for delivering a gift at the hour her apartment decides it can hear itself again. He has started to call the newspapers under other names, she wrote. He says the bins are in danger from witches who enchant them to stay closed. He laughs at his own line. He thinks he is charming when he is ugly. He is cutting strips of paper. He is humming again. He looked at himself in the black window and bowed to his own shadow.

In the morning, the paper that sells more ads than truths ran a story about “bin whispers” and included a photograph of the ribbon and the stamp, out of focus enough to be useless, in focus enough to be a target. It called the ribbon superstitious. It called a man with a shop a “self-styled mender.” It used the phrase vigilante sorting without flinching. Marek laughed, because if he did not laugh he would do something that would make Sabina lie for him later. He bought three copies, folded them neatly, and used them under a table leg that had been wobbling since 1998. The table loved the paper’s new purpose. Not all insults are wasted.

At noon, the door opened and Old Pán Karol came in with his cuckoo and his curses. He had timed this visit for a day when men were doing war with paper because he understood, with the delicacy of a man who had once been married a long time, that battles need interruptions if they are to be won by clean means. The cuckoo was behaving like a trumpet at a funeral. It would not stop announcing its own importance. Sabina took it in her arms like an infant that hadn’t learned schedules yet. She opened the case, cooed lies at the mechanism, and began to adjust the spring with the caution of a person who has broken springs before and learned humility in the act. Marek sat and let his knuckles remember how to behave when nothing urgent is required of them. He listened to the city’s deeper noise, the one under the tram bells and the gulls and the paper story. He heard the brass of the Great Seal, wherever it was, arguing with the ink about who mattered in the relationship. He heard the click of a camera held by a man who would make a photograph of ribbon today and caption it with a line he would consider clever at midnight and forget by morning. He heard his grandmother singing. He heard himself say, once in a square, the word enough as if it were a possible thing to put your back against. He heard, through the wall, the blue-lidded bin outside decide to hold its temper one more day.

Toward evening, Zuzana texted a photograph that made him sit down. It was the Great Seal. It lay on a table, tired and a little ashamed, with a red ribbon tied to it in a knot that had been done with precision and contempt. The knot was almost right. Almost. One tail untucked. A tiny contradiction. She had written under it: Found. Someone slipped it into the archive while the older woman on the third floor was feeding her grandson cookies in violation of every rule that saves us from mice. It smells of the wrong ink. We will clean it. We will tie it to the ledger again. Come in the morning. We will press the ribbon first. Bring your rhyme.

He slept like a person who had been allowed to skip an exam and been told it would not be held against him in the book of years. In the morning, he put on a clean shirt, which for him was a strange bravery. He met Zuzana in Room Twelve with Hronec behind her with his bird on his shoulder because the parakeet had developed a taste for bureaucracy and refused to be excluded from a ritual. The seal lay in its place. The ribbon lay along the edge of the ledger in the way of ribbons that have made peace with their duty. Marek tied the knot, loop through tail, tail through loop, tail tucked along the line. He said the rhyme with embarrassing seriousness. He pressed the seal into the red pad. He pressed the seal onto the ribbon. The red took. The brass sang the small bass note metal sings when it is pleased. He pressed it then onto paper that needed pressing, not because the city loves paper, but because paper needs love if it is not to be hateful.

“Done,” Zuzana said, which is a word no one should trust, but it fit the moment. “We will have to write a memo about how to keep men with neat coats from touching things that do not love them.”

“We will write a rhyme in the manual,” Hronec suggested, and laughed until the parakeet pretended to peck his ear.

They walked out into a day that had qualms about itself and changed its mind twice on the way to lunch. The ribbon on Kapucínska had been retied by someone who had not been told the rhyme and had remembered it anyway. The blue lid sat, the green lid breathed, the yellow did its ridiculous angle in a way that was funny now that no one wanted it that way. People threw things into the proper mouths with the exaggerated care of people who had felt mocked for a week and were uncowed. It would not last. It would. Both are true, like weather and people and trams that arrive on time.

The enemy was not gone. He would not be gone. He would find a switch, a train table, a timetable, a water main, a story about witches, a joke about seals. He would call reporters and he would hum and he would fold paper with knives in it. Marta would tell them when he sneezed. Ondrej would move like a man who has found religion in work that refuses all chapels. The legal woman would scold the idea of charades in a memo that would be forwarded to men who do nothing and printed and placed in a file that would never be opened by anyone useful. The boy who inspected them would come by after hours and ask Sabina for the knot again because his grandmother had looked at him after he got it wrong and said: try that again but with respect.

At closing, Marek wrote in his ledger in a hand that has been taught by jars and ropes and one bad pigeon: Stamp returned. Knot learned. Paper pushed. Ribbon held. He underlined held because it pleased him to see the word on the page making a promise it could keep and because underlining makes a man feel like he had done something to hold up the roof. He put the ledger away and leaned on the counter and listened one more time. The city breathed. Its breath carried malt and exhaust and new ink and the river’s old joke about men and their ropes. He whispered back, which is to say he put his ear to the grain of the door and let it tell him which side of it he was on, and for the time being, that side had a kettle and a knot and in the alley a cat that did not stop visiting because the weather had gone wrong. He closed his eyes a moment and allowed the day to tie a small, safe bow behind his heart.

After dinner—bread and radishes and a spread of something he ate because it had been given to him and not because he liked it—he took the long way around the block before bed. He wanted to see the bins without being seen seeing them. You cannot watch everything all the time. You choose your corners. His corner was learning him as much as he was learning it. He touched the ribbon and felt nothing dramatic. You do not always get light from your threads. Sometimes you get the quieter satisfaction of feeling the knot you tied in the morning and knowing it had the decency to remain itself in the dark. A gull scolded a shadow. A bicycle’s light flicked its small eye. Upstairs, in one window, a woman put a plant on a sill and then took it back inside and then put it out again, practicing the only art anyone has ever truly learned, which is to say: how to decide where to put a living thing so that it forgives you for not being a god.

In bed, he slept with his palms up again because his grandmother had said once that the things you do twice become yours if you do not make a speech about them. The whisper did not come and he saw in the gap it left how much he had missed its irritations. He dreamed of stamps that thought they were moons and moons that had been pressed into ribbon and left their shadows there like greasy kisses. He dreamed of the pigeon he had hurt and in the dream it forgave him and in the morning he woke with a wetness at one eye he pretended to blame on a flake of dust that had survived the municipal cleaning schedule.

He went down to the shop. The bin outside wore a ribbon that had frayed a little in the rain. He tightened the knot again without thinking about it. He unlocked the grate, the grate called him by his familiar name in that scratch of iron and habit. The bell did not bow; it nodded. He said “Dobré ráno,” to the room and the room answered by not arguing. He put the kettle on and the kettle decided to do everything it had done for months and considered that an adequate life. He waited for the day like a man waiting for a tram he knows will come because it always does, because the city is sometimes honest in its littlest virtues if you are generous enough with your big ones.

The first client was a woman with a broken mirror frame. It had, she confessed without needing to, been broken in an argument with a man who did not deserve the word, and the mirror had not cracked because it had a better idea of loyalty than most men. He told her he could make the frame hold what it had always held without pretending to erase the moment it had tried to turn into a weapon. He told her he could stitch the crack of the wood with gold. She said yes. He took the wood and listened to it. It complained in the useful way of things that want to be put back. The gold whispered the stupid rhyme to itself because gold is contrary and learns lessons it does not need. He made the stitch. He smoothed the edge. Sabina, across the room, watched with a witch’s disinterest and a student’s love. He felt the city forgive him again for loving objects, and he forgave the city for loving paper, and he thought that perhaps that was the only kind of politics he could live long doing.

At noon, the door opened and a man came in with a hat he did not take off at first because he thought the shop would be impressed by hats. He took it off when the room did not flinch. He smiled. He was or was not handsome depending on whether you like men who believe that every light has been hung for them. He put on the counter a red circular piece of paper with the city’s seal pressed onto it. It was perfect. It was the real one. It had been pressed this morning by a hand that had been made to be careful by someone who had recently learned to fear a parakeet. Under the seal, in handwriting that had practiced until it felt like someone else’s, the words: Comply with kindness. He looked at this as if he had done it. He had not. He would not. He would do it next time and pretend he had been there for the first, because that is how certain men travel through their own lives.

“I see you have your ribbon,” he said, almost sweet. “I see you have your stamp. I see you have your crowd. Tomorrow I will bring a committee.”

“Bring bread,” Marek said. “We will give you soup.”

“Bring a lawyer,” Sabina added without looking up. “We will give her biscuits. She will need them.”

He laughed, because he knew how to swallow a slight and turn it into a gem in his mouth. He left the red circle on the counter. It did not belong to him. It stayed where it had been put and would not be stolen by anyone’s gaze. After he left, Marek put the stamped circle on the wall near the door. He did not pin it straight. He let it tilt five degrees, a posture that would make the city look twice and then forgive him and then look twice again. He pressed the ribbon with his thumb, not because it needed his thumb, but because the day did. He went back to the bench. He lifted a tiny brush and dipped it in gold. He began to stitch. He did not hum. He preferred the room like this, with the rain on the sill, the kettle threatening to sing, the city breathing as if buttering the afternoon with a fat it had earned by not letting itself be unsorted.Chapter 10 began like a window being wiped. The rain had spent the night inventing tricks for gutters and then, by morning, remembered its job was to leave. Kapucínska looked rinsed. The tram did not squeal; it murmured. The ribbon between the bins had dried into a soft gloss that made it look as if it had always been meant for weather. Marek set the kettle on and let the steam find the corners sleep had left untouched. When he lifted the grate, the shop smelled of glue, old wood, and a lemon peel he had left on a saucer yesterday because a grandmother taught him that citrus convinces rooms to behave.

Adam delivered news as if he were paid in nods. “Committee in the annex at two,” he said, hands around his paper cup like a street organ with one tune. “They say they will decide if knots are witchcraft or municipal spirit. I’d sell tickets.” He looked at the ribbon with the kind of pride you take in something you do not own but helped to name. “Also,” he added, lower, “trucks were sent to the wrong mouth in Ružinov. Ondrej is there with his vest like a warning.”

Sabina came in tapping her phone as if pulling a fishing line. “We have eight volunteers with gloves,” she said, the Sutúrna chat spilling across her screen like fast handwriting. “Two masks. One woman with three children and a sense of humor that keeps them from licking the wrong things. We can sort the spill if the site lets us.”

“They will not let you,” Marek said, already reaching for his coat. “But they will be unable to stop you if you arrive with biscuits and rules.” He put the shop’s sign to Back Soon in a hand that managed not to apologize. “We should bring sugar,” he added, as if it were a tool.

At the Ružinov point, the heap had the sullen posture of a problem that had just realized it would not become a scandal. A driver stood with his wrists on his hips in the way of men who know this is not their fault and are afraid someone will teach them how to accept blame anyway. Ondrej’s vest had found its authority again; authority likes vests if they are worn by men who greet by name. He waved Marek and Sabina into the cordoned square and introduced them to a foreman whose eyebrows had been rehearsing disapproval for thirty years and could not improvise. “You can’t be here,” the foreman announced.

“We aren’t,” Sabina said cheerfully, already pulling on gloves. “We are a rumor about civic pride. Don’t worry, we brought our own buckets.”

They divided the heap the way you divide a day when it threatens to overwhelm you: edges first, then the middle, then the parts that want to cut you. The heap yielded. It always does when hands are not trying to prove a point. Someone started humming and then stopped because it was the wrong tune for this; someone else said the wrong name for PET versus HDPE and then laughed and learned; the children were put in charge of paper because children have a genius for shame-free correction. Marek felt the city’s mood tilt a degree toward a solvable problem. Even the foreman softened when Sabina offered him a biscuit with the military dignity of a woman who understands he needs to feel thanked for having considered saying yes.

A young inspector arrived panting, the form still warm from a printer that had learned to ignore panic. It was the boy from the other afternoon, his jacket big enough for two jobs. He began to say words about liability and stopped himself mid-syllable, watching the way one of the pensioners tied a knot in a bag that would not slip. “I can log this as a training exercise,” he said, and it was the kind of little corruption that saves cities and makes no one rich. “For myself,” he added, because some confessions are a kind of armor.

By noon, the heap was no longer a heap. It was a line of things with their names returned, waiting for their appropriate gullets. Ondrej clapped the foreman on the shoulder and the noise was not macho; it was relief striking relief. Marek rinsed his hands at the spigot and thought, as he always did after a mess that becomes less, how much of his life had been lived for the pleasure of this exact before-and-after.

After an hour for soup and the absurd luxury of bread buttered too thick by a woman who insisted you cannot be brave on an empty stomach, they walked to the annex. The building believed itself temporarily important, which all annexes do. It had chairs that wanted to be moral and walls that had, at some point, briefly been fashionable. In the corridor, notices with the genuine red seal sat like well-bred dogs. Comply with kindness, they whispered, and for once the whisper did not offend him. Zuzana stood by the door folding and unfolding a copy of the agenda as if trying to crease it into a better plan. The legal woman—Pani Právnik, who had never agreed to that title and could not avoid it—touched the ribbon at her throat and nodded like a soldier dismissing the idea of death as an out-of-scope event.

The room filled with the usual hands: eager, bored, hostile, trembling. Viliam arrived without theater, which was, in its way, theater. He had on a softer coat today. It signaled contrition in a language only men who want absolution without confession speak. He took a seat as if he had been invited to moderate and would decline out of humility. Marta slid in and took the last chair in the back, face attentive in that way women learn when they have to be present but cannot afford notice. She did not look at Marek. She did not need to. The look had already been delivered and signed for by their long understanding.

The chair of the committee cleared his throat with the little satisfaction of a man about to enjoy his own paragraphs. “We are convened,” he said, and began to say phrases like legislative intent and compatibility with European guidance and public safety in a voice that could not decide whether to be paternal or merely exhausted. He introduced the question: ribbons on bins; unsanctioned rites around public utilities; unauthorized countersigns; the question of whether the city could keep allowing charm to stand in the street pretending to be procedure.

Zuzana spoke first. She took the words the chair had sharpened and dulled their edges with competence. “The ribbons are an internal control for community behavior,” she said. “They provide a check on counterfeit directives. They tie into a physical infrastructure in a way that discourages tampering without creating entanglement hazards.” She slid a folded memorandum across the table that had been stamped in the proper style and ribboned in the proper knot. “We propose adopting the counter-mark as an auxiliary indicator until the seal’s reformatted issuance process is concluded.”

Pani Právnik spoke like a woman pouring clean water into muddy wine and making it drinkable. “The city has always had practices that live in rooms without fluorescent lights,” she said. “We codify them when we must. Until then, we respect them out of pragmatism. Repair—” she glanced at Marek and allowed herself one centimeter of lyric “—is a public good when it shows its stitches. What is proposed is not witchcraft; it is the domestication of a rumor that happens to work.”

Viliam smiled the way men smile when they believe they are about to win by letting everyone exhaust themselves. He rose, because chairs are temptations for him, and addressed the room as if it were a body in need of a diagnosis only he could provide. “We can love menders and insist on the rule of law,” he said, voice a balm he had bought at a shop expensive enough to label it as such. “We can enjoy stories and refuse to let them direct trucks. I invite us to consider cleanliness as an ethic. We cannot have ribbons on bins any more than we can have saints on stop signs.”

He held up one of the fake notices from yesterday and let it flutter like a bird someone had not caught correctly. “People obeyed this because of a stamp. They obeyed because paper told them to. Paper is a seducer. If we allow undisciplined counter-marks in the street, we invite chaos. Either the city speaks or it is spoken over. Honor our seal. Burn the ribbons. And for those who insist on tying knots as a performance of care, let them do it on their own cupboards and not on the city’s.”

Before Marek could decide whether to speak from his chest or from his hands, a chair in the second row clicked. It had been wobbly for years. One leg announced its plan to embarrass its owner in a way that would become a story told at dinner and resented by the man’s wife for months. Without looking up from her notes, Sabina bent, assessed, looped a scrap of ribbon she had pretended not to bring, tied the knot in one smooth motion, and stamped it with the tiny brass lid she carried on a string. The chair stopped its performance and remembered that humility is a furniture’s best virtue. The room laughed: small, involuntary, human. There is nothing like laughter at minor salvation to soften a policy. The chair of the committee almost smiled. Zuzana looked at the knot like a prayer that had decided to go to work.

Marek stood because the moment allowed it. He did not make a speech long enough to become a painting. He said: “I am boring. That is my defense. Knots are boring until you need them. They are habits with memory. Ribbons are not saints; they are reminders. Cut them if you like. But then tell me how you will remember with your hands when the paper is wrong. Also, if you insist on cleanliness as an ethic, I will happily let you sort a heap with me. Today, Ružinov. We were there. We did not hum.” He looked at Viliam then, not as a duel, but as a man might look at a puddle and judge whether his shoe will forgive the splash. “We will be here tomorrow to listen to your committees. We will be here the day after to tie knots if your policy takes naps.”

Public comment is usually a graveyard for patience. This time it was a little theater that decided to be useful. The cobbler spoke four sentences that made the journalist in the back stop pretending his pen was a lens and listen. A woman whose son collected bottle caps like prayers said that the blue bin had kept the boy from thinking the world was senseless. An old man with a cane that had chosen to behave spoke a blessing in the old tongue and then translated it into the kind of Slovak that belongs to shopkeepers and tram drivers. When the chair tried to thank them in the manner of men who consider gratitude a way to conclude, the pensioner with the repaired chair raised his hand and said: “Keep the ribbons one more week. Measure complaints. Also, if you insist on approving things, approve a better broom for the corner by the theater; it is disgraceful.”

They adjourned with a provisional that everyone recognized as victory and called, out loud, merely a pilot. The knot would stand. The counter-mark would circulate with a memo attached like a chaperone. The fake notices would be audited for ink the way a rumor is tested for malice. The chair looked relieved to have something to call prudent. The legal woman allowed herself to say out loud that she would attend the evening sorting if anyone brought good cake.

On the steps, people shook hands with themselves by shaking hands with Marek and each other. A reporter asked him for a quote and he offered him the knot instead. The reporter filmed his hands and then, without warning, asked Sabina what she thought of being called a witch by a newspaper headline. Sabina said she preferred mechanic and that brooms are excellent for sweeping and fools for riding, then waved at the camera as if it were a child peering over a counter.

By dusk, rumors had been replaced by a plan. Zuzana sent a message across the Sutúrna chat that read like a deployment order: tie knots on central bins; stamp them; take photographs; send coordinates; ignore all notices without ribbon. Ondrej sent a photograph of his vest as a joke. The boy inspector sent a picture of his grandmother’s hands practicing the knot on the arm of her chair and wrote: She says the rhyme is bad. She will improve it. Adam sent a voice message that recorded, inadvertently, the article of faith that passes between strangers after they have done a shared unreasonable thing, which is to say: a laughter that recognized itself.

Night, like any adversary with a budget, had hired helpers. Papers fell again, fewer this time, and men in reflective vests who had not been given enough sleep cut ribbons with little, efficient snips. Their hands were clean. They were not malicious; they were obedient. They left the cut ends on the ground, because when you cut without love you forget to pick up your mess. Sabina watched from the shadow of a doorway and recorded none of it because not every insult deserves the oxygen of electricity. When the men turned the corner toward the theater, she stepped out with a spool and tied three knots where there had been two. The city can be redundant in its better ways too. She whispered the rhyme not because she thinks knots listen but because she does.

On his workbench that afternoon, Marek had mixed the ink a different way. Cobalt and sugar again, yes, but also a pinch of a powder Pani Běla had kept from a printer that died in 2006, and a whisper of vinegar, and the rind of an orange that had spent a week in Zuzana’s office learning to forgive men for lying about dates. He painted the thinnest possible line along the interior ridge of ribbon where the blade would naturally pass. He apologized to the ribbon for making it complicit in a petty trick. He explained that the city would not do this always. The ribbon did not answer because it is ribbon and not a person. Sometimes that kind of silence is mercy.

When the knives came at two in the morning, the blades drank that line like a lie told in a hurry. Sugar loves skin. Cobalt loves sugar. Vinegar persuades them to marry. By dawn, the hands of the men who had cut were faintly and undeniably blue. It was not the kind of blue a sink forgives. It clung like rumor, like memory, like ink on a ledger that refuses to wash. Gloves did not help; the blue had already decided to live in the lines. It was harmless and it would fade, but not before the morning shift at the depot and not before coffee at the kiosk and not before they touched their faces on instinct and left a little evidence on the cheekbones pride polishes.

The city laughed, not cruelly, not entirely kindly. Children noticed first, as they always do. Teenagers pointed, which is a public service when it is not a sin. Adam invented a call-and-response that would be rude in church and perfect at the corner. The cobbler repaired a heel for a man with blue palms and said nothing, but his silence was a sentence. The boy inspector had blue smears on his index finger because he could not resist testing, and his grandmother said “tak vidíš” and made him help her peel potatoes with one hand while the other embarrassed him. Marek walked to the corner and did not gloat. Gloating is a luxury for men who do not mind tasting themselves sour later. He nodded at the men with blue hands and offered wipes as if this were not triumph, but hospitality.

At nine, a picture came from Marta with a caption that gave the morning its taste: His sink is blue. He is angry at the sink for remembering. He has sprayed cleanser into it as if it has insulted him. He is humming so much his kettle is jealous. He is leaving the apartment wearing gloves like a surgeon in a bad film. He will make a joke about infection. Do not laugh at the joke; it will feed him. She added, as if she could not help herself: I think he has never had dirty hands on purpose. That makes him dangerous.

By eleven, the committee reconvened for an emergency they had not planned to have. The chair had an ink dot on his cuff that made him privately superstitious. Pani Právnik arrived looking like a woman who could unblue a whole river with a sentence. “It appears,” she said crisply to the room, “that unauthorized tampering with control ribbons will result in reputational dye transfer. Perhaps we should add this to the memo under Best Practices: wear old clothes when misbehaving.” She did not look at Viliam. The legal art of triumph is never looking directly at the mistake that granted you your victory.

The faux notices came down faster than they had gone up. The seal, re-ribboned and chastened, pressed its circles with a dignity that did not ask to be thanked. Zuzana took the afternoon to rewrite a training manual that would teach timid young men and women to distinguish between paper that asked for obedience and paper that asked for thought. She used the word thought twice in sections that would be cut by a humorless superior next year, then reinserted by a secretary with an aunt who fixed radios and an empty house for meetings after seven.

Marek and Sabina took the rare, ridiculous hour to sit in the shop and fix something small and not civic. A woman brought in a music box that refused to be tragic. It had been wound too far by a child who believed in more. The tune inside had jammed and was now sulking. Sabina opened it and leaned over it like a conspirator. “You are allowed to stop,” she told the spring, fingers gently persuading the coil to remember which way was release and which wound pain. “I will not make you perform. I will ask you. You can say no.” The spring said yes, because sometimes being offered no unclenches the fist. The tune crept out into the shop and made the bins outside feel briefly like they could dance without scandal.

“Do you think he will stop at hands?” Sabina asked, later, binding a crack in a fruit bowl with a thin line of gold so greedy it almost blushed. “Or will he feel small and make something big to compensate.”

“He will make something big,” Marek said. “But big things tire faster than small ones. That is our advantage. We can stand here and be boring longer than he can sustain opera. We will get a day of quiet for every chorus he forces, and then we will spend that day making hinged things remember.”

The door opened. The policeman from the quarter held it in one hand as if he were always arriving and never entering. He kept his cap on because the compulsion to remove it in shops had been beaten out of him by twenty doors a day. “Pán Košík,” he said. “We received a complaint.” He paused and let the room enjoy the absurdity. “From a citizen with blue hands. He says the ribbon marks are discriminatory against people engaged in the lawful exercise of cutting things. My captain said I should come here to laugh where no one would see me.”

“Would you like a biscuit,” Sabina asked with the gravity of a minister.

He took two. He took off his cap and looked at his palm as if it had told a joke without his consent. He said to Marek in a lower voice, “My mother said to tell you that your knot kept the lid from biting her today. She is grateful. And also that when you have a minute, she has a pot whose handle bad-mouthed her.”

“We will defend her honor,” Marek said. He liked the thought that someone in the city spent their day scolding a pot about its way of speaking.

By sunset, the blue had begun to fade on some palms and to deepen in the creases of others. Men who had not cut anything made a point of touching ribbons to see if color is contagious, which is how civilizations behave around magic even after they have made good laws. Children, permitted a degree of subversion by mothers who had learned the knot, ran through the square with their hands in the air like saints of inconvenient truth. The ribbon between the bins had been retied five times by five different hands and had acquired the tender ratty look of a favorite towel. On it, the tiny stamp winked in the lamplight when the tram went by, an entirely unimportant signal that nevertheless made someone on every passing car feel mysteriously better.

Marta texted once more, late, and the message was not information but a kind of apology only the brave allow themselves. He is bored with the committees, she wrote. He will make something else. He has a book about timetables and a map with pins in places that control what time looks like. I am not clever enough to understand how he means to break what we cannot see. I am clever enough to tell you that his friend at the printer has no more ink and he is annoyed. Also, I have saved some of the blue from his sink and put it in a jar. I do not know why. It felt like a way of telling the room I live in that it is mine.

Marek replied with a sentence that surprised him with how it felt in his fingers: You are writing your own ribbon. He put the phone down and looked at the shelves and saw, with the small start of men who do not often praise themselves, that he was living inside the sort of day that comes back to you later when the window is dark and you do not know what to do with your mouth. He put his hand on the counter. The wood gave back the weather. The bell gave back the names. The city gave back nothing and then, as if caught being tender, gave back a little, enough to keep the kettle worth boiling.

On the way home he walked the long way, through the square with the ugly fountain that has become beautiful because people eat sandwiches near it, past the woman who sells stones and weedkiller and looks like a saint of contradictory commerce, down the steps where teenagers practice being less afraid of what older people want them to fear. At the bridge he stopped and watched the river put away its light. He thought of timetables as another kind of ribbon. He thought of who ties them and who cuts them and who is made late by men who want to be gods of an hour. He decided to buy an alarm clock with bells tomorrow and put it in the window and let it announce itself every hour for a day and see who came in angry and who came in happy and who came in late and loved him for it.

He slept well enough that the whisper did not insult him with charity. Morning came in with a plate under its arm. Zuzana, hair obeying at last because she had won something small and wanted to show it by looking stern, arrived with coffee in cups that had learned how to companion men who live by their fingers. “We have a week,” she said without preamble. “A week to be sensible before they decide if they want to be stupid again. Use it. Tie knots. Teach children. Write your rhyme on the inside of a lid somewhere it will surprise the right person. And tell your apprentice to stop making jokes about broom licenses on the internet. She is very good. She does not need to encourage people with more followers than reading comprehension.”

Sabina, guilty and pleased, raised her cup like a student told to be less successful at being herself. “There is a rumor,” she said, “that someone has put a clock on the statue at the post office. A big one. It chimes at wrong times. People are using it. The rumor says the wrongness is catching.” She did not have to say the name. Some patterns spell it without letters.

Marek picked up his coat. He left the kettle on because leaving things warm is a way of daring the day to behave. He tied the knot on the ribbon with the small decisiveness of men who have taught their fingers how to think. He and Sabina walked into the hour that was trying to undress itself for a man who thought undressing time would make him handsome, and the bins, modest and a little vain, watched them go with lids lifted just enough to breathe.
