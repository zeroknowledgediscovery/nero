Rain on Donegall Place turns the shopfronts into a parade of ghosts. The city likes to look at itself, slick and doubled—lamps in puddles, faces in windows, all of us our own second selves. I’m one of those faces. If I stop and squint, I can put a name to the man in the glass. Maxwell Kerr, twenty-eight, born on a wet Monday. Industry, patience, a bland smile. It is only in the mirror that I ever come clean.

What I want, today, is very small. The kind of small that fits behind the tongue. I want to stand in a place where there is a voice at the front of the room and everyone’s attention is pointed the same way. It softens them; it makes them glow. The person who owns that room owns me. That is not a metaphor. On the bus down to Botanic, I scrabble for the word that would make it acceptable to admit this.

And it is not madness. Madness is loud. I am quiet. It’s neat, like pockets within pockets. You could sit beside me on the 7A and never notice anything, except that my coat is too dark for daylight. I bought it in a charity shop that used to be a butcher’s and somehow the cold from the old stone slabs has leached into the stitches. That doesn’t trouble me. Cold keeps things.

They say the Lanyon building looks like a wedding cake. To me it looks like a grammar exercise in brick. I’ve always liked rules. That’s why I signed up for the evening course at Queen’s. Communication and Leadership, the brochure says, tonight, 7–9, Room 2.04. The font is brittle; the promises are soft. It isn’t the subject that pulled me, not at first. It was the idea of a place where the light comes down in a cone and a person stands inside it and speaks. Where all the rattle of the city is pushed out and for two hours we pretend time is a room we can tidy.

I’m early. I’m always early. It gives me a chance to choose the seat that sees everything—three back from the front, left central aisle, Paul Klee would approve of the geometry. The window beside me is fogged with the night air already, and on it I sketch a circle with my sleeve and look out at the backs of students crossing under umbrella canopies like jellyfish. Their legs are quick and their mouths all open. I can’t hear them, but I can hear the radiators.

Two people arrive. A woman unspools a scarf the color of roses that never happened; a man checks his phone and stuffs it into the pocket of a tweed waistcoat as though he has already regretted his life choice. A third, somewhere in between. They take the front row as if they’re brave. I watch their hands. People don’t hide their hands.

The door at the front opens again and then it is not the room, not the windows, not the radiator, not even me. It is him. He is not tall. He is not the kind of handsome that would get a bus named after him, but his hair is almost too precise, his jaw too clean. He moves like a man following lines on the floor. His name, on the board in dust-white strokes: Mr Kavanagh. The chalk squeaks. His knuckles are pale, stretched over small bones. His jacket doesn’t crease when he lifts his arm. It’s odd what I notice. There’s a thread near the shoulder that is pulled tight but doesn’t move, as if it learned to hold its breath and never exhaled. The light falls and he stands inside it and the room organizes itself around the angles of his elbows.

“Good evening,” he says, and everything in me that had been flat tips up and pays attention. Good evening. Such a ridiculous phrase. I want him to say it again, and he does, because he smiles and says it to the woman with the scarf, then to me. “Evening. Evening.”

We play the games you play at the beginning of such nights. Introduce yourself, say your favorite place. People pick beaches and pubs, quiet places that pretend to be loud or loud places pretending to be quiet. I say St. George’s Market on a Sunday morning because I watched him walk past a sign advertising a stall there last week and I have learned to aim my likes like a man throwing darts in the dark. He nods, routine approving. “Great coffee,” he says, and looks past me to the man in the waistcoat, as if the approval is something to share out equally. He is fair in that careful, practiced way. He gives the same smile to each person, with a slightly different angle, the way a lighthouse shares itself with every ship.

It is the way his voice rounds out the edges of a sentence that catches my breath and holds it. Some people’s words drop out of their mouths like gravel. His words are shaped. I imagine holding one on my tongue and letting it dissolve.

If you put a name on what I am you will ruin it. The words belong to other people. They always do. They become excuses. When I was twelve, the school counselor watched me as if I might combust into a practical demonstration of something she had read in a textbook. I learned then how to keep my face mannered, to leak a smile like a tap. Now, an age later, I am good at it. People call me charming. It’s a design problem, solved. A script that looks like it was composed on the fly. I can sketch empathy quickly enough to pass as fluent. The only thing that betrays me is the way my right hand does not like to be touched.

But he does not need to touch me. It is not that kind of class. He picks up a marker and underlines ideas on the board. He underlines them twice, sometimes three times, then steps back as though the lines must be admired. I admire them where they fall on his cuff. He laughs at someone’s bad joke and the laugh catches in his throat and comes out a second slow time. And the whole time I am thinking, what kind of house does he live in, with what kind of bowls and spoons? I think of walking to the bus stop with him and making a joke we will both later pretend wasn’t a joke. I think of how I would like to empty his pockets of their small things and set them in a row on my kitchen table so that both of us could hold our hands behind our backs and pretend we do not want to touch them.

When he asks us to pair up and practice listening, I pair with the scarf woman. Her name is Linda and she works in human resources and uses every part of her face to show interest in what I’m saying. I tell her what I always tell people like her. My job in IT support, the callouts, the smell of overheated plastic, the small rolling chair. My flat above the barber’s where the floors still rise and fall like waves when a heavy lorry goes down the Lisburn Road, the way the barber sings in Portuguese in the mornings, soft, like metal does when you polish it with your sleeve. She says, “That’s lovely,” and I remember to smile in a way that has teeth but not threat.

When we swap and I am the listener, I think about him instead. He kneels at the front to fix the lead on the projector. Something about the way his knee and the floor negotiate with each other is wrong. It is too precise, the angle too consistent, the pressure too unchanging. I have an eye for calibrations, it’s a comfort. But it’s nothing. It makes me draw my mouth to the side and narrow my eyes and then relax them and nod at Linda as she explains her sudden love of long-distance hiking, which is mostly about the socks.

He tells us there’ll be a break ten minutes to eight. He says tea and biscuits will appear as if by kindness. He brings out a tin and opens it with both hands like a man showing treasure to a child, and I want to be the child. I want to be given something ordinary, made special by the giving. I take a bourbon biscuit and do not eat it. He moves among us, small conversations sticking to him like burrs. I keep my eyes not quite on him. He will learn the shape of my attention, I think. He will recognize it in time, how it attaches and does not detach.

After class, the air is suddenly tired. People stretch in a way they do not at other times, as if the hours have been a kind of exercise. He stacks the marker pens into a row that looks like a skyline. I stand up. I wait for the line I have chosen from my pocketful, something light as a bird you let go. “Good class.”

His head tilts. His mouth has a faint crease on the left side that I have not yet catalogued, that I will. “Thanks. You seemed to enjoy the exercises.”

“They were tidy.” It isn’t the compliment I meant to give. He smiles anyway. The smile is something that has been trained on a leash, trouble removed.

“See you next week?” he says, already bending to lift the tin of biscuits, the lid balanced against his hip. I should say his name. That is what other people do. But if I say his name I will have to accept that it can be said. I could come to his office hours. He mentioned them, spread out on a Tuesday like china. I add that to a list.

Walking home, the rain changes direction three times. In the alley behind the barber’s, the bins are turned out for the foxes. A cat—a slice of shadow—slits its eyes as I slide the bolt on the back door. My upstairs flat smells like all old stairwells do, damp plus the ghost of someone’s cigarettes from January 2004. I boil water and stand at the sink. There are three bowls in the rack. I have a fourth in the cupboard, with the crack in it like a lightning strike wasting itself on white. The kettle clicks. The kitchen window holds me in its reflection above the sink draining board, and I study the man at the rim. He is careful. He is planning himself into a box.

My mother calls just as I sit with the cup. I watch the name bloom and think about letting it go through to voicemail. I answer.

“Maxi,” she says, using the name only she is allowed to use and only when she is lonely enough to tolerate me. “They’ve opened a new bakery where the old mechanics used to be. Sourdough that tastes like it knows it’s better than you.”

“I already know I’m better than bread,” I say dryly. The smile I give to the phone is something else entirely. It’s a trick of the mouth to make the voice warm. On the other end of the city, she laughs the way she does, with a little cough at the start as if laughter is a decision.

“Are you coming Sunday?”

“I might.”

She knows that when I say might I mean I am still arranging the picture in my head of me in her kitchen pouring tea, and that it must fit inside other pictures. She pauses in the right place. “I made stew last week and your cousin Deirdre turned her nose up, so there’s plenty. I’m freezing some in wee bags with dates on them. Imagine me, organized.”

“You always were,” I say. It is almost the truth. She was organized around my father’s disorganization, which means she taught herself to be a tide that doesn’t pull.

She says, “Good. Good. How’s your course?”

“Fine,” I say, but it comes out with a softness that she notices. There are only two people who really watch my voice from the inside—her and whatever part of me has never grown older than six. “The teacher’s solid. He does the lines on the board with style.”

“He,” she says, and I can hear the smile slide into place like a tray. “Is he handsome?”

“Mammy,” I say, letting the childhood go in my mouth and then catching it as it falls. “He’s tidy.” There is quiet. We have learned not to press on certain doors. “I’ll see you Sunday,” I say, because I have added a carrot to the picture. Something to look forward to that I can pretend is large.

In bed I lie on my back and look at the ceiling. I have never known what to do with dreams, so I treat them like clouds. I do not own a plant; I tried once and it shamed me by living. I live without pictures on the walls, not because I dislike pictures but because I am careful of stories that claim space. This one, now, this story, breathes in the room with me. Mr Kavanagh is between my thoughts like a comma. The comma keeps everything from running into itself.

The next day I work in an office that does not love me but does not know that it does not love me. That is acceptable. I help people control their machines. I tell them to unplug and replug with a voice from the lake district of patience. A woman in Accounts phones and cries because her spreadsheet has eaten numbers she cannot replace. I say things like, “You’re okay. We’ll bring it back.” I bring it back. She thanks me with her throat as if gratitude were a disease that will cough itself out. I hang up and put a tally mark in my head under Useful.

At lunch I walk to Ormeau Park in air that tastes like dimes. A group of teenagers run, their laughter shaped like V’s. I sit on a bench and take out a plastic box with the exact number of carrot sticks. The dog that goes past is small and dense, like a loaf. His owner says, “He’s friendly,” and I say, “I’m not,” with a compliment’s tone. He laughs and goes. I watch him go. I imagine asking Mr Kavanagh if he likes dogs and him saying, “Yes, but I could be persuaded to like anything, really,” to a room that likes to hear itself being considered. I picture him at his desk. Does he have pens that are silver, heavy in that reassuring way? Does he use them to sign forms that don’t require signatures, because he likes to see his name as proof that he exists outside his own body?

It is not obsession. That is too small a word and too big a shape. It is attention, pure as a wire stretched tight, humming. The city is full of wires. Look up when you cross the street, you will see them filled with birds.

On Wednesday I see him. It’s an accident. It must be. The city is only so large. I had told myself I would never do it—look for him in the daylight air, the way daylight makes people honest—and here he is anyway, at the window of a shop near Arthur Street that sells clean objects for people who think clean will save them. He is looking at a line of glass carafes with faces smooth as tired gods. His reflection on the glass is more interesting than he is. He rests his hand against the pane in a way that makes the world and his palm meet like strangers at a bus stop. His hand stays there too long, as if whatever is on the other side is being measured. I stop on the other side of the road, in the shelter of a bus stop where the posted map has been vandalized into a different city.

He moves. He looks down at his watch with a pleased surprise as though it has told him a secret. He is not late. He never looks late, even when he is. I adjust my coat and think of the proper lines for the situation. If I step into this, it will become something that must be remembered. That is a weight.

He goes. I don’t follow him. I am not a cliché, I am a craftsman. I hold the image instead in that good place in the mind where it can turn over by itself. The bus comes and the city pushes me onto it.

On Thursday, a flyer is pushed under our office doors advertising a charity comedy night. The man at the desk across from me pinches it between finger and thumb and complains that all the comedians these days are too angry. I imagine Mr Kavanagh at such a night, laughing appropriately, his head turned a fraction to see if people are seeing him laugh. The thought warms me in a way that I do not trust.

I go to the bar off Botanic on Friday out of habit. It’s where low hum meets place. Irene is behind the counter and her braid is a rope thick enough to climb. “All right, Max?” she says, and it sounds like permission.

“Same,” I say, and she fetches the glass she pretends is always mine. The bar smells of lemon and a history of chlorine. A man at the end with cheeks like stones tells a story about his niece and a bakery; people pretend to listen because the story is a coin that will be handed round and they want to have touched it. I sit at the corner and watch the television with the sound off while captions attempt to pour sense into moving mouths. A documentary about toy collectors with the earnestness of a church group doing yoga. The images are bright, hard. Men in T-shirts hold figures up like time-offered talismans. The word mint appears, over and over. The presenter says something about articulation points. An expert pushes his finger against a elbow joint and shows how it bends. The camera loves the frictionless click.

I look down into my glass and see my face reflected in a crimson that belongs to no fruit known to us. When I look up, he’s in the doorway. Not a ghost. Not a if-only. He’s there, not in his jacket, ordinary in a way that makes him extraordinary. He’s with a woman my brain labels incorrect for him because she is too luminous, and then I correct the label because it is a bad habit of mine to pretend men are better than their choices. Her hair is a perfect geometry. She laughs quickly. He laughs in that way that is almost catching throat again. They move to a table, two down from mine. Irene looks at them and looks at me and now I must slow time enough to make the right decision.

I don’t look at him. That is the only decision that matters. If he sees me I will have to rearrange the room. If he does not see me, I can enjoy the map of their dialogue. The sound comes to me in slices, insulted by other sounds. I drink slowly. I let the sentences wander. He says, “I always liked the way you look at things. It’s like the thing and the look both become better,” and she says, “Don’t you dare,” and he says, “Sorry,” and pronounces the sorry with care, as if he knows where apologies go to die.

She touches his wrist with a finger and he does not flinch. My right hand aches in sympathy. His wrist is narrow; his watch strap is a dark band like a mark a man might put on himself when he wants to remember where he has been. Irene glances at me, a question, then returns to her stack of glasses like a woman building a small cathedral one silliliter at a time.

They are friends, I decide. Colleagues. He is allowed friends. I allow it. He tells her something about the class. She says something about being too busy for nights. He leans forward and the posture of his body folds so evenly it is almost laughable. The woman looks at him with the kind of of attention that says she believes in herself more than in anyone else in the room. I am not jealous of that. I know myself well enough to know the person I want is never equal in the wanting. That’s not how it ranges out in my head. In my head I want to build a place for him to stand in that looks like his, that is his, not like anyone else’s. I want him to look at it and say, “Ah,” as if he has recognized a coastline from the air.

He notices me only at the end, when they stand to leave and she adjusts her hair in the reflection of the bar mirror. His eyes flick. Then they place me. He smiles the trained smile. It is not for me, exactly, but it comes close enough to heat my pocket. “Hi,” he says, and steps a half-step, and I let myself nod. All the scripts in me rustle like papers. I say, “Mr Kavanagh,” and my mouth enjoys the shape of it. He pauses—Mr, that makes him wince—and then he grins, taken by the accident of being known. He says my name. Hearing him say my name is like a key turning in a lock that had never believed it was a lock. It fits with a neatness that disappoints me—nothing is that easy—but still.

They go. The door shudders open into the wet night. Irene returns. “That the teacher fella?” she says, amusement with chalk dust in it.

I look at the door and then at my own hands on the table. “Yes.”

“He’s small.”

“I know.” She leans in. The braid slips forward like a pet snake.

“Small men,” she says, “get away with more, I find. People don’t expect them to reach your throat.”

I laugh. It sits wrong in the room, too tight. “I don’t keep throat on the menu.”

She rolls her eyes. “Have another?” I have learned to say no at the right times. I say no, and she goes, and I finish and leave, and the city outside is an icebox with its light off.

Saturday the sky is a collapsed lung of grey. I clean things that do not need cleaning. I take the toaster apart and put it back together into a toaster. I oil the hinges of the cupboard that never squeaks. I sit at the table with a pen and write lists that start out practical and end up in handwriting I do not use for everything. The list says: classes, bus routes, an accidentally remembered poem, how some shoes squeak on linoleum and then do not again, Mr K’s wrist, the marker pens, the biscuit tin, the way he stepped. I draw a line. It is a good line. It does the job of crossing something.

Halfway through the afternoon I open the wardrobe and look at the shelves that are too empty for a man with a salary. In a shoebox is a set of things that do not belong in a shoebox. I touch the fabric of a tie that I once acquired without permission. It has a small pattern like a question repeated until it gives up. I do not put it on. That feels too on the nose. I am capable of something like restraint. Sometimes.

The shop at the corner has the kind of sour gummy sweets that cut your tongue. I buy a bag because they scream and I want to hold the scream in my mouth and silence it with will. The woman ringing up asks how I am. “Living,” I say, and she laughs like she feels responsible for it. On the walk back I pass a child pushing a pram with a plastic infant in it. The doll’s head lolls in that horrible way that suggests too much trust in gravity. The child hums. A man at a window above watches a football match with the sound up so loud the commentary becomes a law.

I sleep badly Saturday night and dream nothing. Sunday is my mother’s. She lives off the Crumlin, in a house that learned to hold itself steady where the street pitched. In her kitchen everything is the same height as it was in 1999. There are magnets on the fridge that no longer magnet. There is a calendar with X’s through all the past days, as if slaying them. She kisses my cheek and I tolerate it because she has earned the right to forget that I do not like being touched there.

“Lovely,” she says, handing me a mug with steam doing its job. “You’re losing weight. Don’t.”

“Not losing anything,” I say, and sit at the table with its checkered tablecloth. She has made stew. It is the same stew she has made all her life, only now she uses the good salt when she thinks she deserves it. She asks me sensible questions. I answer them with sensibly prepared answers that make her think she knows me. We both find this arrangement kind.

In the living room my father’s chair sits like an apology. He has been gone six years and the chair allows him to assist with the weather. Someone on the radio talks about a fundraiser for a men’s shed and my mother says, “You’d like that,” and I nod and put stew on a spoon and eat it without letting my face tell anyone what it is doing. She looks at me and I pretend to miss her looking. The quiet is not unkind.

When I leave she presses leftovers on me. I take them because she needs to see me with weight in my hands. On the porch she says, “You’re all right, are you?” Not a question I can answer truthfully. I lie like a man smoothing a sheet.

“Good as gold,” I say. She hates that phrase. “Gold is heavy,” she says, as if she is tired of giving me metaphors to smash.

Monday toes me like a cat. At work the spreadsheet woman brings cake to say thank you and I refuse it with a regretful gesture that convinces her that I am at war with sugar. In the afternoon I feel a heat under my skin like a radiator too near a curtain. It is anticipation and there is no use pretending anything else.

Before the class I walk the Botanic gardens with a pace that would be normal if I carried a different face. The glasshouse holds its breath around a tropical dream. Students kiss at the edge of things the way they always have, as if the edge were a promise. I sit for three minutes and imagine the life in which I am the kind of person who reads newspapers on park benches with gloves. My hands do not like gloves unless they are the right weight. I own a pair of exactly right gloves. They are at home. I am not wearing them. I flex my right hand and it complains, and I stroke the thumb with the other and look like a person thinking.

In the room, the people have changed their places. Linda’s scarf is a lesser rose. The waistcoat man is in denim, as if he is something else today. Someone new sits in the chair at the end and looks afraid of all the empty around her. He is there. He is there. It is obvious that he has been there for some time because the pens are lined up already and the marker lid is open and there is the faintest smell of new whiteboard marker ink, which is the smell of the idea of factory more than of a real one.

“Evening,” he says, and no one in the room knows how their evening has been until he tells them. He claps his hands together once, a soft, unambitious clap. “We’re going to get strange,” he says, and the room laughs because they think they are prepared to be strange. He divides us into groups of three and hands each group a card with an exercise that is meant to make the real thing push against the pretend and see which one persists.

My group is Linda and a man who says his name too quietly. Our card says we must negotiate the end of a project with a person who thinks the project is something else entirely. We assign ourselves parts. It goes as well as any performance, which is to say it makes everyone aware of their lack of edges. In the midst of it I catch him looking over, not at me but near me, as if he is checking on an experiment that he forgot he started. I speak and the words come out smoother than I intended. He nods. He says, “Good,” and then later, to the room, “Did you see what Maxwell did there?” and the sound of my name in his mouth makes the air between my ribs move as if it has found a door.

After, during the break, I take a biscuit I do not want, exactly. He pours tea and the kettle does not leak. The lid to the tin makes that particular metal mouth click that happens only when metal says yes to itself. He stands near the window and for a moment in the glass he is a silhouette of himself. I step toward it, not him, not him, I am careful, and he turns and I am there. The words I have chosen line up in a queue and one of them is the wrong one and jumps.

“You said my name like we were friends,” I say, and smile in a way that makes it mostly a joke. His eyes reflex to the left and then back. It is a tic that is almost not a tic.

“Did I?” he says, as if he has been accused of doing something worthy. “Apologies. I have a habit of—”

“Keep the habit,” I say, and this is when I should say something about the exercise, about the way Linda triangulated the discussion back to the end. He says, “Are you enjoying yourself?” and I think about enjoyment like a poorly translated manual. I say, “Too much,” and that is not a joke. There are ways to say I am too much that make people like you. I am good at all of them. Tonight, I want to see what his face does when it meets the end of the leash of comfort.

He laughs. It is soft and something like vulnerable. “That’s good,” he says, and then we are separated by the neat tide of people needing more tea than there is.

On the walk home I carry the biscuit in my pocket like a relic. The city is so exact about its bus times it is almost rude. My flat, when I open the door, smells faintly of stew, faintly of this morning’s coffee, faintly of myself. I put the biscuit on the table and sit down in the chair and consider telling the truth out loud. It is not necessary. Everything important I keep contained can be kept that way if I let it.

I sleep and wake and everything is the same until it isn’t. The difference starts as a smudge. It is in the way he uses his hands on Wednesday, demonstrating the difference between directive and collaborative language. He slicks his palms together and shows us the two halves of his quiet. He lifts his hand to emphasize a point and the cuff rides up to show the wrist bone and—here is the thing that makes my mouth dry—it pauses. Not the movement but the quality of it. It is too even. The joint does not protest in the way skin often does. The line of it is relentless. He sets the hand down on the desk and the lack of soft sound is like a space where the carpet should have sighed.

You could say this is silly. You could say I am making a mountain of a gesture. And yet. I work with machines enough to know the three movements people do with objects they trust. They drop, they pat, they set. He sets. He is careful. But he is careful in the way a person is careful with a thing that belongs to someone else.

After class Linda says, “We should go for a pint,” and I try to imagine myself in a triangle with her and him and quickly close the picture. “Another time,” I say, with regret deployed like perfume. She nods. “You’re a slippery fish,” she says. She means it as a compliment. She tilts her head. “Mind yourself.” She is the kind of person who gives out warnings as if they were vitamins.

I don’t go home. I walk the city until it is unreasonable. The Albert Clock leans. The Cathedral pretends it is made of water. The air is sharp enough to teach manners. At a certain corner I stop. It is not because I see him. It is because I see a version of him, in a shop window display, turned three-quarters away in a posture of invitation. It’s a figure in a suit, but smaller than human, posed mid-speech with a miniature marker in his mini-hand, the elbow bent just so. My body does something wretched. It holds still and then it tries to laugh and all the laugh comes out through my fingers as a tremor.

It’s a toy shop. Of course it’s a toy shop. I have never been inside it. The window is a set-piece of nostalgia done in creams and greys, and in the center is this articulate figure of a man with the exactness of cheek bones I could draw with my eyes shut. The sign beneath says some nonsense about modern professionals and collectibles. There is also a price. The number is absurd, a sign that the world is a joke that isn’t sure who it is making fun of.

I walk away. I walk back. When I walk away the world feels untidy, when I walk back the world becomes a knot I could pick. My rational mind—such as it is—tells me this is nothing but coincidence. The jawline is not a common jawline, but the city is full of cheekbones. This one has a tiny tie that mirrors an ambition. My hand against the glass is my hand against the glass. The plastic is the idea of skin with all the trouble taken out.

Inside, a bell rings in that sweet tinnny way bells in films ring. There’s a man behind the counter with hair that looks like a helmet. He says, “Hiya,” and his eyes are a kind of gleam that would make aficionados weep. Shelves are arranged with more rules than a church. I could close my eyes and not knock a thing because each thing is so solid in itself. I cannot tell you why I feel the peculiar peace I feel, except perhaps that I belong in systems that think they are ungenerous, and here things are given their perfect small frames.

He pulls the figure from the window with the kind of careful that I respect. He lays it in a box lid like a patient who trusts their surgeon. Up close, it is absurd. Up close, it is true. The joints are neat. The elbows promise. The suit is stitched with a kind of satire. The face—if you laugh I cannot blame you—has his mouth. It has that left-crease that refuses to entirely lift. It has the eyes of a person who is watching the room from the center of it.

“It’s new,” the man says. “Just came in. It’s part of a line—they have the doctor, the creative director, this one’s the public speaking guy. Look—” He holds up the box insert, printed with phrases. Inspire. Lead. Resolve Conflict. The paper glows. It is a temple of idiocy. I want to bow.

“Do the joints move?” I ask, as if this is the question. He bends the arm and it obeys him. There’s a click, slick, precise. The elbow aligns at ninety degrees and then at forty-five; the wrist twists two clicks to the right. The hand opens, closes. Noise surprised itself in my throat. How much, I start to ask, but the number on the card is already the number in my mind.

“I’ll take it,” I say. He wraps it. He has a soft tissue that breathes like summer. He places the wrapped thing in a bag with a rope handle. He smiles as if I have done the right thing. When I step outside, the air looks at me and waits to see what I will do next. I don’t make it home fast. I walk slowly, aware of the weight in the bag, which is not weight at all. At red lights the bag hangs and the rope handle warms my fingers.

In the flat I do not turn on the big light. I put the bag on the table and sit and then stand and then sit again, more delicately. I remove the tissue in a way that would make a saint weary. The figure looks like someone asleep, on the newspaper I use to keep the table from its scratches. It is exactly him and not him. It is the right size for a man to hold indefinitely. The right weight. He could stand on the mantelpiece I do not have. He could sit on the desk with his legs a tiny set of separate possibilities.

I lift him by the waist because the manuals all say this is what you do with delicate machinery. The plastic at my touch is the same temperature as the room. When I press my thumb against the ribcage there is a give. The arm raises. It stops at the exact angle that he raised his arm tonight to point out the bullet point about mirroring language. Everything precise, everything undeniable. I put him down. I laugh, loud enough to scare the cat that is occasionally my cat. I laugh until my eyes water because now the map of the city is different. I ate a biscuit I didn’t like and now I am eating the idea of him and it tastes of sugar and salts you only used to wash wounds.

It is late. And then it is not late. I stay up and move the figure through the motions of the ready-made heroics. He raises a marker like a sword. He points. He adjusts his tie. He looks at the room with eyes slightly painted. I put him on top of the biscuit tin and my heart does a trick. I put him by the window where the silly rain can touch him with its light. I move his wrist two clicks to the left. I feel, idiot that I am, tenderness.

I do not sleep. When I close my eyes I can see the line between the person and the object, and it is as thin as a seam of light under a badly fitted door. The city outside murmurs like an old man who needs to tell you where you went wrong. At five-thirty and the first trucks begin to hum, I pick the figure up and hold him in my left hand and look at my right hand as if it were a different person’s. “Good evening,” I whisper, and the plastic does not answer and yet I am answered.

By the time the next class comes, I have been changed by a stupid purchase. Your brain aligns to a shape the way shoes align to feet. I can sit behind my eyes and watch myself acting naturally. I can feel my face be regular. But beneath, a click. A new articulation. If it is madness, then it is my brand. He speaks and I nod and when he writes on the board I count the lines of his palm that show beside the chalk. We do the exercises and Linda says, “You’re in a good mood,” and I say, “I slept,” and she looks at me like she doesn’t believe anyone sleeps anymore.

He says something about feedback. He does the thing with his hands. His laugh is a room you can tiptoe through. After, as people chatter, he picks up the biscuit tin and closes it, and I could write a novel about the sound the lid makes on the way down. He is a person and a possibility and a pose. I do not care which. I would have sworn I didn’t.

The class empties. The windows are black with night. He lingers, and I linger, and etiquette suggests that I say something ordinary and go home. “That shop near Arthur Street,” I say, and stop because I have not decided on the tone, because I am terrible at beginning in the middle of anything.

He looks up. His head tilts. “Yes?” His mouth makes a small half movement that suggests a different version of now.

“They have these ridiculous figures,” I say. He smiles slowly.

“I’ve seen them.” The room contracts. My heart does not so much beat as reorder itself. “Funny,” he says. “Someone gave me one as a joke once, years ago. I think I lost it moving. Strange what people think you want to own. A little you.”

I swallow. It is a dangerous moment. It will depose all future moments if I let it. “Maybe sometimes a little you is better than a lot,” I say, and my voice comes out into the air and stands there watching me.

He nods, as if I have said something that means more than it appears to. His mouth does the crease. He does not step forward. He does not step back. He picks up his bag and sets it on his shoulder in a motion as neat as a hinge. “See you next week, Maxwell,” he says. He looks at me as if he is measuring something in me that he cannot name. He leaves. The room exhales. I remain. The biscuit tin is very quiet.

When I get home I take the figure from the shelf where I have placed him like a votive. I tell him the truth of the evening, and the truth of the way he said my name, and the truth of the way his mouth made the left crease. I articulate his arms in sympathy. I put him on the table and sit and watch him until I can hear the radiator speak.

The city rains. The cat sleeps. The night is a wooden box that closes itself a finger at a time. In the morning I will learn the exact distance between a plastic smile and the original. I will stand in a room again with a man whose job it is to speak and I will believe him, and I will not. I will find the place where the joint stops moving and decide if that matters.

The figure is very still. He is still in the way only an object can be, the way that says, I neither love nor stop, I neither learn nor unlearn. The hand on the miniature marker is a perfect circle. I turn off the light. In the dark I still see him, small, and the larger one imprinted behind my eyelids where I'll keep him soft, for just a little while more.In the morning I take the figure to the sink and wash his hands as if he has been somewhere. The water beads on the plastic like respect. I dry him with the hem of a T-shirt I keep for tasks that require softness and pretense. Under my fingertips he resolves into his degrees: the triceps that exist because a designer wanted them to, the give of the shoulder that promises compliance without complaint, the mouth that will never surprise itself. It is a relief to handle a world that loves intention. On the windowsill the chill tries to climb in, and I let it touch my knuckles until they sting and the right hand flickers, that way it does when it remembers the day years ago a man clapped me hard without warning and my nerves decided to inventory every touch thereafter. I set the figure down on the draining board, where the pattern of scratches looks like a city seen from a long-distance plane. He stands perfectly, ridiculous in his balance. I envy it, and then I forgive myself for that small anger because envy, like everything, needs somewhere to go and this morning it can sit on the edge of the mug with the tea and blow on its fingers.

At lunchtime I open the top drawer of my desk and look at the accurate inventory of pens and cables as if there is a message in the way the USBs lie like fish with their mouths waiting. A man stands by the printer cursing quietly, and the cursing is so reasonable that for once I like him. I fix the thing by asking him to turn it off and back on again and he looks at me with gratitude that makes me wish I were cruel enough to reject it. I keep thinking about office hours and the way those words make a day look like a door with a polite sign on it. If I walk, it will become an appointment; if I write my name on a list, it will turn into a record. If I bring nothing but my face, he will have to deal with the shape of that. I decide to bring a question because people like structures, and questions are small scaffolds that reassure everyone that we are building something real.

The corridor outside his office has soft carpet that is too soft, as if it has learned to keep everyone’s footsteps quiet so that they will stop noticing themselves. His door is half open. I knock on the wood anyway, a measured rhythm that does not sound like me when I hear it. He looks up. His desk has the skyline of pens I expected, but also a mug with a crack that has been mended so neatly it has become decoration. There is a spider plant with two long shoots like arms reaching for a thing that keeps moving. On the wall is a shelf with books lacking their dust jackets, their raw cloth spines in shades of time. There are two photographs. One is a child with a football holding his face in that determined way children do when they suspect laughter is being asked of them. The other is of a coastline. It is not an announcement; it is neither Donegal nor Antrim that I can tell; it is a line between water and rock that has agreed not to say which of them will win.

“Maxwell,” he says, and the name puts the air in order. He gestures to the chair in front of his desk. It is the kind of chair that forgives the fact of sitting. “Come in. What can I do for you?”

“Feedback,” I say, as if I am here because of it. “The way you described it last night—how it is a gift that sometimes feels like a punishment. I wanted to ask about… calibration.” If he hears me saying the word I live by, he does not show it. He touches the edge of the desk with his fingertips like a man consulting a map written on varnish.

“Okay,” he says, smiling in a way that suggests agreement before agreement exists. “Calibration. Tell me what you mean by it.”

“Does the person,” I say, and watch his wrist as it slides, smooth as a decision, from the desk to the pen, “calibrate to you, or do you calibrate to the person?” I lean back one degree, on purpose, because that’s what people who are enjoying themselves do when they are playing with an idea. “You know—are there norms you trust, or is it always bespoke, like a suit cut for someone’s bad posture.”

He laughs. It is a smaller version of the laugh I know. His right eye creases a beat earlier than his left. “Nice,” he says. “I like that. Honestly? A bit of both. You need, at the very least, a floor. Something you won’t drop below. But apart from that, if you’re doing it well, you take the other person seriously enough to borrow their angles. Cheaper than a suit.”

“Cheaper,” I repeat, and we let the word be ridiculous together. I look at his hands because it is better than looking at his mouth. The left rests easy, the right performs competence like a faith. He has a strip of white skin where the watch strap lives. He reaches for the mug and the ring of ceramic clicks on the desk but too cleanly, as if he has practiced not making noise. Something moves up his sleeve like a ripple and disappears. It is probably nothing. It is probably everything. “Do you ever get tired,” I ask, “of being the person who owns the room.”

He leans back now, mirroring without meaning to, or meaning to, which is worse. “Owns,” he says softly, as if the word belongs to people with wider backs than his. “It’s a job. I don’t—own. I rent it for the hour and clean up after.”

“That is the most Belfast thing I’ve heard,” I say, and he smiles the local smile, the one that appears when the city catches its own eye in a mirror and pretends not to be pleased. He glances at the plant as if it has said something to him and then back at me.

“Do you want to own a room?” he asks, and it is a joke and it isn’t. I consider lying. I consider telling him my entire head in a handful of sentences. I settle on a quarter-truth because it will feel like a full one in his office with the soft carpet.

“I want,” I say slowly, letting the verbs behave, “to be in rooms where my attention isn’t wasted.”

“That’s fair.” He nods as if he is putting a small tick beside my name in a ledger. “You have good attention.”

“You haven’t seen it when I’m doing it badly.” The idea of him seeing that thin wire gone slack makes me fractionally ill, which pleases me because nausea means there is a boundary and boundaries are proof I have not entirely dissolved.

He does the professional tilt of the head, the one that says, I know people. “I’ve seen enough to think you have… an engineer’s eye. For behavior, I mean. You spot the load-bearing beams.”

I would like to put the phrase load-bearing beams in a box and keep it on the kitchen shelf where I can see it when I make tea. “I like clean lines,” I say, and his eyes do that reflex left-right that I have only noticed because I cannot help it. “And screws that fit.”

He laughs again, a little helpless this time. “I’m not sure if we’re still talking about feedback.”

“We are if feedback is carpentry,” I say, and listen to us getting along like a well-made drawer.

He looks down to his notebook and flips it open. The motion is too precise for accident; the flip lands exactly three quarters of the way through, the pen sets at the top of the page with its clip aligned to the margin. I consider the possibility that he learned this carefulness from someone who had to. There’s a scar, a pale one, along the knuckle of his right thumb that suggests a door once went wrong.

“Here.” He writes down three bullet points, then adds two, then underlines the title because that is who he is in a room with a surface. He spins the notebook to face me. The pen navigates his fingers in silences too smooth. “These are a few frameworks. Not rules, you know. But, approaches. Outside-in. Inside-out. Feedforward.” He smirks. “I hate that word. But it’s useful. The idea of pointing people toward what they could do rather than circling what they failed at.”

I read and nod and say useful things because they are useful and because he is feeding me and I know how to eat politely. When I leave, I leave too slowly. At the door I are-you-sure myself with a look that would be obvious to anyone trained to hear goodbyes trying to become something else. He says my name again, not because he has to, but because it is a small kindness and he is good at those.

Outside the office the hall smells faintly of toast and the old dust of copied paper. Students swirl past like a new weather. I stand in the stairwell and let the music of many voices run over me the way I used to let waves hit my knees when I was a child and thought I could negotiate with the sea by closing one eye. In my bag the notebook with his handwriting becomes a weight. I will not copy the letters into my own hand because I do not need to own them to know where they live on the page.

On Arthur Street the toy shop bell rings like it remembers me by scent. The man with the helmet hair nods as if we are members of a club with dues. There is a small lectern, of course there is, separate and sold as if there are many tiny speeches that must be made. There are accessories in clear plastic: a series of miniature pens, a water bottle the size of my thumbnail, a neat black bag. He offers me a discount with the satisfied grace of a person who enjoys the economy of repeated faces. I buy more than I mean to because absolutes are only useful if you keep them visible and today I feel like I’ve earned the right to hide one in my coat pocket. Back on the pavement I can feel the little lectern like a second heartbeat against my ribs. I am ridiculous, and I’m not. Across the street a woman in high heels stumbles and swears in a voice that could strip paint and the city forgives her because she wants something badly enough that her shoes insist.

At home I build a room out of paper and habit. On the kitchen table the figure gets his lectern, his bottle of water, the marker that is only a thought of a marker. I put out a circle of coins as an audience because I like the way they sit in rows and glint about it. I pause when I catch myself arranging ten and then two and then adjusting the gap like a man planning a funeral seating chart. There is a point beyond which allegory is a threat, I tell myself. I move the coins into a box and replace them with dried chickpeas because they do not shine.

In class he does the thing with the stories. “Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned,” he says, and everyone in the room obliges him with their curated defeats. Linda talks about a presentation where the slides were the wrong ratio and the words ran off the edge like embarrassed guests at a wedding, and she makes a joke that lands because it is reasonable. I am assigned to a pair with someone new, a man who says his name firmly but keeps his eyes a quarter lowered like he is stingy with himself. I talk about a job where I told the truth to a manager who mistook honesty for insubordination and how I learned to wrap truth in better paper. While I say it, I look at Mr K and watch his body hold the room without holding it too tightly. The movements remind me of the figure, and the figure reminds me of the movements, and the loop is pleasant in my mouth like mint that has made peace with being too bright.

On the way out, in the hall that smells like everything that ever learned anything, the luminous woman appears like a conclusion to a sentence I told myself I wouldn’t finish. She is with a man I have not seen before. He is gray in a way that suggests gentleness, which is trickery. She says his name as if it were a small joke, something like Fergal. They speak with heads leaning in and Mr K stands with his bag on his shoulder again like a sensible wing. I stand beside the noticeboard and pretend to read about a poetry night that will be three people too much for my nerves. I catch a phrase that is a permission slip: physiotherapy. The luminous woman says it like a code for something else. She pats Mr K’s arm with the unselfconscious authority of someone who has patted that arm since he was smaller. Sister, I decide, and then sneer at myself for needing to file it. He replies with a half-grimace that offers itself as modesty. “It’s grand,” he says, and the grand is too soft to be entirely truthful. “It’s better than it was. The exercises help.”

The roof of my mouth goes cold. There are many kinds of exercises. Not just the ones where you rehearse sincerity. Not just the ones where you learn to mirror a room. Somewhere in this city is a person who moves his joints with him, who counts the clicks of a wrist that perhaps was built or rebuilt, who measures how many degrees a knee decides to trust. I think of the click at the elbow of the figure that I loved because it made me feel less alone and I am ashamed of this: that part of my curiosity was laziness dressed like insight. I have built a temple to precision and called it a man when perhaps the man learned precision the way you learn not to touch a hot thing a second time.

The thought doesn’t cure me the way I thought it might. It doesn’t make me moral. It makes me more alert. Morality, I have found, is very dull company when you need to be interesting enough to keep someone in the same room as you. I fold the word physiotherapy into a small square and put it in the pocket where the figure’s lectern could fit. Mr K glances toward the noticeboard with an absent politeness that includes every head in the hall and lands on none. For a heartbeat his eye catches mine and there is the loop, the attention tether between us, the nothing that is not nothing. “Maxwell,” he says, the easiest greeting, and I nod and say his name like a small coin. The luminous woman turns and looks at me without kindness or unkindness. She is measuring whether I am a person who will matter, and she decides I am not. It is such a relief I could sit down.

My mother calls on a night when the sky is the color of the inside of an unripe pear. She wants to tell me that Aunt Sheila’s knee is giving her trouble again and that the man at the corner shop sold her ham that was more story than substance. She also wants, I suspect, to find out whether I am the kind of son who would tell her if he were happy in such a way that she should prepare her house for someone else’s shoes beside the door. “Are you eating properly?” she says, and I say, “I am eating beautifully,” and she laughs and tells me to stop being fancy. I do not tell her about the little man at my table. She would forgive me immediately and buy him a hat.

Friday brings the charity comedy night at the big dull hall off University Road, where the chairs stack their patience and the floor smells of a thousand spilled beers doing their Biblical miracle. I go because I am a craftsman and accident has its limits. He said he might be there on the flyer because sometimes he hosts these things, lends his voice for a cause; that’s how the literature phrased it, a lending, like he can be given by the hour and returned without wear. I put the figure in my coat pocket where my right hand won’t want to be; I decide to let it sit there anyway like a small test of will. The hall fills itself up one person at a time until it hums with the thick contentment of people who expect to be convinced that life is amusing. I sit in the middle because I am greedy and because the edge would make me think about leaving, and then I might leave.

He is not the first. Three well-meaning men make jokes that take longer to explain to themselves than to say. A woman with hair like a mistake saves them by being very exact about what she wants and what she doesn’t. People clap; people whoop; a couple two rows behind me conduct an argument in whispers on the subject of who left the gas on. Then he is there, casual from the side like a second thought that has been rehearsed. He steps into the light without that small stutter the others had, the little pinch where the body remembers it is about to be looked at. The room loosens around the waist.

“Evening,” he says, and the word sets the clocks in a row. He does the business about the charity, light as a bar towel. He makes a joke about a bucket being an old-fashioned way to move money from hand to hand and people laugh because they like a joke that reassures them they are kind. The thing that gets me, that makes my hand curl in the pocket around the ridged plastic of the figure’s tiny water bottle like a threat, is when he tells a story about a time he spoke and the technology failed him. He files off the names and places so as not to embarrass anyone because he has the pastoral tone of someone who will be back in this city again next week. He talks about the microphone dying mid-sentence and what he did with his hands while the sound waited for him to remember that he has a voice without wires. “I used to,” he says, and the used to drops into the room like a small stone that leaves ripples, “freeze when people were looking at me. My whole body would—refuse. You ever see a throw-in at a football match when the player keeps going to take it and, no, not yet? It was like that for me. The physio—God bless her—taught me to break it into joints. One hand here, one breath here, one knee bending like a suggestion, not a command. Sometimes,” and he smiles in a way that displays a private joke he has decided to share, “sometimes the body loves an instruction. Sometimes it needs one.”

The room approves this confession. The comedy continues like a river finding wider water. I cannot tell if what I feel is pity, and I do not care because pity is too simple a word for the thin complicated nothing that expands between us when he says joints and I think of plastic clicked and a hand that would not be touched, mine, and a hand that learned to be touched, his. I do the test I set myself: I reach two fingers into my coat and press the figure’s elbow. It resists the way it should. It yields the way it should. The shape of my want does not change with this new knowledge; it articulates. It becomes more exact.

After, there is milling in the foyer, the polite chaos of people pretending not to be choosing whether to go home or make the night bigger. He is there, talking to a man who runs a youth club. I watch the back of his head the way you watch a museum piece you have no intention of stealing. Irene from the bar appears like an answer to a question I haven’t asked. Her braid is up tonight, serious as a sermon. “You,” she says, poking me in the shoulder with a pen she has no right to make charming. “You look like someone who needs a drink.”

“I look like someone who has had one in his pocket,” I say, tapping my coat where the figure hides, and she snorts as if her day is improved by evidence of my weirdness.

“You’re not wrong,” she says, eyes cutting past me to the room. “Your man’s good. I like him better when he doesn’t try so hard. He always tries so hard. It’s endearing. It’s exhausting.”

“Some of us don’t know how to do anything else,” I say, and she looks at me with an attention she usually saves for the till. “Keep your throat off the menu,” she says, amused with her own prophecy, and she presses a stamp onto the back of my hand, a star with five points, as if I deserve entry to anything.

I go home because home is what you do when the night has more to give than you should take. In the kitchen the little lectern glints like an idea. I place the figure behind it and gesture to him in the way I have seen him gesture to us, palm open, offering a slice of himself like cake. The radiator ticks as if counting off the minutes since I entered the room. I have a tiny screwdriver from a pair of glasses that broke once and could not be reborn, and it becomes an instrument. I press it gently to the hinge of the figure’s wrist and hear the smallest sound as the plastic decides to consider my will. The elbow gives another click and sits now at a position that I did not know was intended for it. I ask myself whether I am cruel. I ask whether, when I stroke with my thumb the place just under the jawline of the little man, I am practicing for something I have no right to. There are questions that are only useful if you want to stop. I am not stopping. I am learning the exact distance between the point you can push and the point you can return, the place where a joint will shiver if you ask too much, the place where it will forgive you because you never meant to.

A storm pretends to assemble itself and then decides to wait for a more dramatic night. Saturday I wake with the figure on the windowsill as if he has stood guard. I buy bread with seeds that scatter like unfaithful plans. The woman in the shop tells me her cat has learned how to open doors and I buy a tin of sardines without remembering doing it. I walk along the Lagan where the river makes a noise that sounds exactly like a river should when it knows you will try to idolize it. On the weir three gulls practice looking meaningful.

On Sunday my mother takes my hands without asking and looks at the backs of them as if they have left me a note. “You’re wound up,” she says, and she always did know how to say complicated truths in a way that made them seem like weather. “I’m working hard,” I say, and she looks past me at the garden she has decided is thyme-heavy now. “Hard isn’t the right word,” she says, and we let the stew stand between us like a referee. She tells me she dreamed of my father again, and in the dream he was in the kitchen making tea and he looked up and said, “You’re late,” to her, and they both laughed like that was their joke. I ask her if she misses him, and she says, “Like I miss my right hand when I sleep on it and wake and it’s gone,” and I have to go to the sink and run water just to have an explanation for the way my eyes changed. I do not tell her about a man in a room who organises sentences the way she used to organise bills, by date, by threat.

In the next class he announces a new shape. We will, he says, give speeches. “Two minutes, about a person who mattered,” he says, and the room tenses because love is easy until your voice has to prove it. He adds, gently, “You can lie. If it makes it easier.” I pick up the card with the prompt and it is so small in my hand that I laugh. When it is my turn, I talk about a man who taught me the difference between polishing something for show and caring for it so that it can be used. I say this happened at a bicycle shop when I was a boy, and maybe it did, maybe it didn’t. I talk about the way grease smells when it is doing its job. I talk about hands that looked like maps of a city I hadn’t yet learned. I do not look at him while I say these things because I’m not a monster, and because metaphors are weapons and I am trying to only wound the air. When I finish he says, “Thank you,” with the extra softness he keeps for the room when it surprises him.

After, when the chairs scrape and the pens are capped and the woman with the nervous laugh at the back tells a story to a person who is not listening, he comes to stand near enough to invite a conversation. It is a simple thing. He tells me he liked the way I left out an ending. He says, “You let us fill it in,” and I say, “I am lazy,” and he says, “You are careful,” and we leave it there. But as he bends to pick up the biscuit tin, something in the angle of his back rearranges the room. It’s the sigh that doesn’t come, where the spine would usually send a note to the lungs to check in. It’s the way the jacket behaves like a promise made to fabric and kept. It’s the small moment where the right hand refuses to help with weight and the left does more than its share, gallant. The biscuit lid finds the rim without his eyes. The click is perfect.

“Pub?” Linda says behind me, insistent as a friend who has decided on a good outcome and will not be shaken off it. “Tonight you’re not allowed to be a slippery fish.”

“I can be a sedentary fish,” I say, and she grabs her coat with the impatience of someone who has never yet missed a bus and felt that absence become a philosophy. I go because refusing too many invitations in a row makes people suspicious of their own likability. We sit under a speaker that believes in itself, and Linda tells me about her mother’s spaniel who looks at her like a person when it wants forgiveness. The waistcoat man, who has become denim man and then cardigan man, says that attention is the rarest thing in a room and he is right and he is wrong. When Mr K arrives half an hour later, late enough to come in clean, he waves in that same small way that suggests the hands have signed a pact to make the world easy. He does not sit with us because he does not know yet that that is what comes next. He stands at the bar and orders a sparkling water like a man who has tasted the drink that dies and decided he prefers life.

I go home sober enough to trust the knife with the apple. The figure is where I left him and I am glad because sometimes I like to give myself the pleasure of being glad about things I already knew. I place the figure’s palm flat on the table and press down until the wrist registers the pressure without hum. I lift and his hand stays where I put it, for a moment, learning the angle of my decision. “Good evening,” I say, and the sentence stands between us like a fence I have built just the right height to climb. Outside, the rain returns to the city with dignity and purpose. In my chest something that is not madness makes a list and checks it twice. I am good when I have a plan. I am better when I make the plan look like an accident. I lie down and the ceiling studies me and I study it back. Somewhere in the building a pipe clicks, and a floor settles, and the night moves its weight from one foot to the other, ready for the question that comes after all the good evenings have been used up.Morning finds me with a spoon in my mouth and no taste for breakfast. The figure stands by the kettle as if about to offer a keynote on boiling. I set him at the edge of the worktop and make tea, my right hand hovering, my left efficient. Steam lifts like a soft argument. On the windowsill the condensation makes a slow map of weather across the glass, and I write a word in it because the child in me is not dead, only negotiated with. The word is hinge. I leave it there to drip itself toward illegibility and watch as the dot over the i fattens and rolls downward like a bead of an idea refusing to stay neat.

By ten I am at my desk pretending the world is fixable. The printer eats a job with a hunger that is almost endearing, and I talk it out of its appetite with the kind of tone usually reserved for small frightened animals. The spreadsheet woman brings me a packet of shortbread as if I have saved her from a war, and I thank her with the grace of a man who is trying to get better at accepting kindness. My right thumb throbs in the predictable rhythm it learned years ago. If I close my eyes I can see the classroom of a different life and the boy with the bright idea of a joke that involved clapping the back of my head, hard, and the way the world tilted the wrong way for a full beat and never quite stopped. In a tab on my screen the search results sit like a polite catalog of excuses. Physiotherapy, upper limb, Belfast. The names are friendly, the logos kind. I pick one near the river because I like the way water behaves when it runs out of things to reflect.

Walking down in the early afternoon, I keep my eyes on the pavements because some days the city is too much face. The clinic smells like a clean that has earned its right to exist. The woman at the desk has eyebrows that communicate full sentences. She takes my name and invents a slot in three days’ time with the skill of someone who knows how to talk bone and calendar into agreement. “It’s mostly the right hand,” I say, holding it as if it were something I’ve been asked to show at customs. “Old thing, doesn’t like surprises.” She nods the way trained people nod when they’re filing information without letting you hear the drawer close. On the wall behind her a poster depicts a bright red cartoon spine looking cheerful. It feels like a lie on my behalf, which is a relief.

Back at work I draw a tiny brace in the margin of a notebook without meaning to. It looks like a child’s drawing of a bridge. The figure waits in the kitchen all afternoon in my imagination like a well-behaved dog. Every now and then I picture him listing, but he is balanced even in thought. On the bus home, two teenagers argue about whether a song is better loud or quiet and I want to tell them that loudness is not the same as attention. I do not tell them anything. The bus breathes me out at my stop. In the alley the bins look weary of their own dramatic lives. I carry bread and sardines and the certainty that I am building something I will later pretend arrived fully formed.

At the table I unspool the tools with ceremony only I can see. The tiny screwdriver again, a piece of sandpaper folded down to a cunning edge, a strip of cloth cut from the inside hem of a shirt I no longer wear. I do not believe in magic but there is an incantation in the order of objects laid just so. The figure’s wrist receives the faintest rasp, not enough to mark, only enough to know the place has been visited. I fashion a cuff from cloth and glue and patience, a suggestion of support. It sits there delicate as a promise. I hold his forearm between my fingers and feel the give that is the truth of him; I think of the clinic and the way the physio will probably take my hand and make it do things the world told it not to, and the ordinary kindness of that makes me unexpectedly breathless. When the glue dries, the cuff looks like it isn’t there, which is when it is doing its best work.

In class that week, the university’s heating remembers itself and the room fogs to the exact degree that makes everyone glow with the same faint halo of sweat and effort. He has a cardigan on, which is a garment that announces itself as sole carer of its buttons. The chalk on the board drifts down and settles in the edge of his hair like winter done in flour. He notices and rakes fingers through it while listening to a man in the back relate a story about a conflict that was mostly two people politely refusing to admit they hated each other. “There’s the content,” he says, “and there’s the relationship,” and the words snap into place like parts of a drawer you had been putting together backwards. I write the sentence, not because I need to remember it, but because I like to own a version of it he hasn’t seen.

At the break Linda presses a biscuit into my hand as if we are in a church and I have sinned sugarless. She is making a habit of testing the edges of me. “You seem different,” she says, soft enough that it can be ignored if it lands poorly. “Happier. Or tighter. It’s hard to tell with you, the difference.” I put the biscuit whole in my mouth because it will force me to take a second before choosing a reply, and she laughs like she knows she’s been staved off in a pleasing way. He crosses the room with two cups, gives one to the new girl who sits like a person waiting to hear if she is a citizen, and looks over at us. It’s the kind of look you give a table you own the legs of. When his eyes move on, the silence between my ribs shakes itself and sits.

I do not go to see him after class. I go home and there is the sound the door makes when it decides you are permitted, and the figure on the kitchen table wearing his new invisible support like a secret medal. I stand him in front of the lectern and speak for him in a voice that is not a joke. We make a vow together not to tell anyone how ridiculous we look in this arrangement. In bed I lie still until the place where the right hand joins the arm begins to pour its old complaint. I breathe the clinic’s smell at the edge of my imagination like a draft from a good corridor and tell the ache that I am taking it somewhere edits can be made.

The clinic on Thursday is busy in the way rooms are busy when they do something useful without spectacle. A radio whispers about traffic. A man of an age that makes everything a little noble sits with his knee obediently elevated, his sock quite white. A teenager in sports kit stretches with the desperation of someone who has not yet learned to be patient with their own body. The physio who calls my name is a woman whose hair remembers being in a ponytail even when it has been released. She takes my hand and her fingers are the right temperature. “Tell me,” she says, and I do. I talk about the clap in the old school corridor and the way a palm on my right shoulder now is the wrong sentence and the way my hand prefers to act alone. She nods in the language of anatomy. She rotates, she palpates, she asks permission with her eyes even when the answer is obvious. Then she sets my hand on the towel and tells me where we’ll begin. “The joints talk to each other,” she says. “We can teach them to say better things.”

The work is small, which is to say it is full and tight and demands respect. She teaches me to roll a ball under my palm with intention rather than hope. She shows me how to bend the wrist not to its drama but to its mild. She asks me to breathe. “Sometimes,” she says, and my body recognizes the phrase from two nights ago and wonders if language travels the city tapping on windows, “sometimes the body loves an instruction.” When she’s done, she loops a band around my fingers and makes me widen and close, widen and close, until the tremor arrives like a letter with my name on it. “There,” she says. “Not bad. You’ll hate me tomorrow. That’s normal.” I like being told what I will hate. It gives me a chance to prepare better sentences for my face.

On my way out, he is on his way in. The chance of it is absurdly fair given that the city is a pocket and we keep being coins. He wears a coat that looks waterproof because he is the kind of person who lets fabric keep its promises. His mouth is in neutral. There is the moment you get in hallways where your trajectory meets someone else’s and both of you make a small adjustment that is like a miniature courtship. He makes room without making it obvious that he is making room. He catches sight of me and surprise opens his face like a drawer. “Maxwell,” he says, and the softness arrives as if he had been saving it for a sentence like this. “Are you—” and he gestures toward the interior world we are about to trust with our moving parts. It is a generous gesture, an invitation not to explain too much. “Hand,” I say, and show it like a passport I am finally comfortable having examined. “You?” He lifts his right elbow a fraction, the sleeve pulling back enough to show a sliver of bandage where skin meets watch. It is not theatrical. It is not a confession. It is a fact hung in the air to dry.

“Boring maintenance,” he says, cheerful in the way people are when they would like you to think they are very boring indeed. “I keep telling it to behave. It keeps negotiating.” The physio with the hair calls his name like a chord played softly. He nods to me once, a neat exact nod, and goes in. I stand for a second in the lobby where the cartoon spine makes faces at us all and feel the knot of me loosen by the smallest measure it can. I am careful about what I call hope; I have to be; it has, historically, overpromised. But there is a strand of it now that is more engineering than wish, and I give it a quiet place to live.

In the office later I roll the little ball under my palm and hide my exercises inside my job. People thank me and I do not use their gratitude as currency; I keep it like a kid keeps smooth stones. In the evening I set the figure on the draining board again and pour a thin stream of water over his forearm so that the cuff darkens and then lightens, the way fabric does when it learns it has survived. I wonder if I am practicing gentleness or inventing a version of it that will pass in public. Then I decide that practice is itself a version and that will do.

He is different the next class in a way no one else could chart. His ease contains a stitch that wasn’t there. When he writes, he writes with his left hand more than before, and the right hovers like a supervisor making sure there is no funny business. We do an exercise that is a small disaster. People are required to stand and ask the room for something inconvenient; to be refused; to ask again with better grace. It is a lesson in doors. I do well because door-handles and I understand each other; because I was taught early that there is a version of No you can balance on your palm until gravity gives up. He watches me do it and the nod he gives me contains a fraction of mischief, and I find myself liking him for the way he lets liking exist where we can both see it without dressing it up as anything else.

After, in the corridor where notices go to be ignored, he steps into my path with the kind of accidental precision I have come to rely on. “Hey,” he says, casual, but the second syllable is a little careful. “Thanks,” I say, because the word thanks is good for general use and causes no allergies. He tips his head toward the outside world, which has produced a fresh rain for us to admire in our coats. “Walk you to the gate?” he says, and manner makes it sound like he is asking me the weather, but my chest hears it the way it hears all invitations, as a calibration problem waiting to be solved. I say yes because you don’t say no to a clean ask. The air outside has decided to be dramatic for no one’s benefit. He zips his coat like a person who understands instructions. We step into the rain at an angle that suggests we think we have an agreement with it.

He talks about the course as if it were something he is borrowing. He mentions a man who once said feedback to him in a tone that could have pickled an onion. He laughs in a way that lets me know he survived and kept the onion. I listen and offer additions that do not look like chips. We reach the gate and he keeps talking, and my inner geometry clicks the situation forward a degree. He gestures with his left hand and then notices he has and looks a fraction amused with himself. “I’m doing the thing,” he says, and shows me the exercises the physio set him: a wrist that rotates, a stretch that makes his forearm become a paragraph. I show him the rubber band the woman gave me, which lives now in my pocket like a snake that has found a cause. “Ah,” he says, delighted with the coincidence that is not unusual enough to be witchcraft. “We’re colleagues now,” he says, and laughs at the ridiculousness of owning any word too big for two people and a piece of elastic. For a moment, it is almost simple; that’s the dangerous part, the manageable simplicity. Then a student runs past yelling someone’s name into a phone and the umbrella they are holding cocks and we both step out of its path with the same movement, two lines on a floor following each other.

I do not do the unkind thing of following him past the gate. I could. It is raining and we could be a pair of people walking in the rain for reasons that do not need explaining, and the city would forgive us as it always does. But there is a line where craft ends and theft begins, and I am not interested in petty theft; if I am to rob anything, it must be time, and I would like to be lawful about that, as lawful as someone like me can be. So I say, “See you,” and he touches the brim of a hat he is not wearing because politeness is muscle memory for him, and he veers right and I left, and the river in my head continues going wherever it is it is going.

When the clinic gives me homework, I do it with a fervor that would embarrass anyone if they were watching. I graduate from ball to putty of the exact shade of sadness. I knead it as if it owes me rent. The physio corrects me without scolding and I am grateful in the way only people who have been properly scolded know how to be. “Don’t chase the pain,” she says. “Invite it. Then ask it to leave.” I think of the small man on my table and the big one in the room and wonder which of them will take an invitation and which needs a train ticket. On Friday I bring the figure a new tie that came mistakenly with an online order and cut it down with ridiculous care. He wears it like it belonged to him all along. I am aware that I am building a shrine. I am also aware that the only difference between a shrine and a desk arrangement is honesty.

Linda insists on a drink again and I allow it because moderation doesn’t have to be joyless. She tells me a story about a man at her office who apologizes in emails before he has done anything wrong, and we both try to decide whether he is dangerous or just in possession of a habit that will ruin his heart. Irene serves us with the grand manner of someone pretending to be bored. “Your man,” she says, nodding toward a corner where he is not, which pleases me, “came in Tuesday with Ms Luminous. Family, it looked like. She told him off about not letting people help.” I laugh because the idea that other people are conductors too is comforting. “He needs told off now and then,” Irene adds, and looks at me the way she looks at a spill: neutral, prepared.

The new exercise in class is a thing with eyes. He makes us look at each other for a measured length of time while saying nothing, the kind of activity that is meant to give people back to themselves and mostly makes them want to look at the floor. He pairs me with the quiet man with the stingy eyes and then, because he is a menace, comes to stand nearby and observe us observing. I let my face be the friendly face I keep for trains. The quiet man shuffles and then steadies and then becomes a person. I can feel Mr K watching not the faces but the piece of room between them where language usually goes, and the attention does the good thing of making me want to deserve it. When the bell on his phone says time, everyone sighs like they were hoping for a letter and got a bill and found it was a mistake in their favor.

At the end, as we drift, he lingers, and I do not know whether that is because he wants to or because lingering is his way of cleaning up after the rented room. “Tea?” he says, as if he has not learned that we are a nation that cannot refuse such a noise. We hover over chipped mugs in the staff kitchenette which is a cathedral to milk of uncertain provenance. He leans against a counter as if it is comfortable for him, which I know now is sometimes not the case. “How’s the hand?” he asks, and I tell him about the putty as if we are discussing a friend with an unfortunate hobby. He smiles as if I have pleased him, which is a ridiculous effect to give a man to have on you, and yet. “You ever think about teaching?” he says, and takes a sip, and the question falls into me like a coin into a fountain you were told not to throw coins into. There is a superstition in me that says if a person like him asks you a question like that and you let it pass, it will go and live somewhere else and not come back. “Sometimes,” I say, and feel the word fit me like a shirt that knew my shoulders. “But I don’t know if I like rooms enough to own them.”

“You don’t have to own them,” he says, smiling over the rim. “Just rent with intent.” He makes a small face at his own phrase because he knows better than to admire himself out loud. “You notice things,” he adds, as if naming what I do is not the same as blessing it but in this case it is. “That helps.” He sets the mug down and the sound is not the sound I expected. It is lighter. He has learned to make noise kinder. The knowledge sits in me like a crumb of bread I decide to call sustenance.

On the way home I buy a plant, which is a betrayal of a promise I made to myself years ago when the last one survived my neglect and made me feel like a bad god. This one is stubborn, a pothos that even YouTube cannot kill. The woman at the till says, “He’ll trail if you let him,” and I think about what I am letting trail behind me these days and whether I want the floor covered. I set it on the windowsill near where the figure stands when he is thinking. In a week it will look like it belongs there. In a month it will soften the room. In a year I will have forgotten that I once hated living things for being proof of time.

Night comes the way it always does here, as if pulled down by a string. I sit at the table and write a list of the names I will give the plant and the figure and the part of myself that learned not to jump when someone says my name. The ordinary day lies down beside the oddness and they pretend to sleep. The radiator makes its clicks as faithfully as ever. Somewhere, in a different room, he lifts his arm to the angle the physio wants and holds it, and somewhere my mother is peeling potatoes with the radio low so she can hear the street. I say good evening with the soft authority of a person who has rehearsed it. Then I say, aloud, very quietly, what I have so far refused to tell the room where he stands: I will borrow the room for an hour too, one day. I will set a lectern down and call something mine until I give it back. The figure blinks in my imagination and then stares, properly, like the little professional he is, and I laugh because the night does not mind me being sentimental when no one is watching.Chapter Six

The plant grows like someone who has been praised and can’t quite remember for what. Each morning there is a new comma of green at the tip of a vine, and in the evening the comma has become a clause. I catch it trailing its sentence toward the cupboard handle and slide the tendril back, gentle bureaucracy. Naming it feels like a small lie I am not obliged to tell. I try names on in my head anyway. Names that suggest vigor. Names that suggest a humbler life. The figure does not want a name, not because he is above it but because to name him would make of him a person, and he is not. He is an arrangement of plastic that makes my chest behave itself. Sometimes that is enough; sometimes it has to be.

An email arrives from a university address that has learned to pronounce my surname correctly on the first try. A list of housekeeping notices and then a line that shifts the light in the room. Volunteers wanted for a short demonstration next week. Two to three minutes on an area of practice you know well. The subject is nothing—no one cares; the point is to stand up and let the room lift or find out that it won’t. It is signed with his name the way he writes it when he is being more himself than Mr, the g leaning a fraction as if it is beginning to run. I stare at the line for long enough that the interface worries about my connection. The yes in me is not loud. It is a felted word. I reply anyway and do not reread the reply because if I reread it I will begin adding apologies and every apology I write comes with a second, ghost apology following it like a bad smell.

The physio uses me as a diagram. She taps lightly along the bones of the wrist as if waking a set of tenants who have both paid their rent and refused to speak to each other for a decade. “This doesn’t have to be dramatic,” she says, and I appreciate the principle. She stands me with my back against the wall and asks me to breathe without lifting my shoulders as if breath were something I can teach my body to do tidily. “You’re preparing for something,” she adds conversationally, which should irritate me—this presuming—but doesn’t. I picture the kettle and the plant and the small lectern on my table. I picture the length of a room with chairs that have been forgiven for squeaking. “A little talk,” I admit. “An arranged trap.”

“Keep your chin where it belongs,” she says, demonstrator calm, as if chin is a flight risk. She places my right hand on a ball and watches the way I move from shoulder because the wrist is sulking. She corrects with two fingers and the world narrows to the exactness of touch. “Think of moving from the center,” she says. “The joints are just the messengers. If the message is good, the way it arrives won’t matter as much.”

At home I lay out the ridiculous: the lectern, the figure, the mug of water that has become a prop because my mouth believes thirst is a performance. I stand where the radiator decides the air and aim my voice at the door in case the door intends to heckle me. The talk is nothing special. It does not need to be. Two minutes on a practice I know well, which suggests honesty as tool, which suggests the exactness of screws. I decide to talk about fixing the specific: the lie people tell themselves about turning things off and on again. I make it about listening, which is cheating. I make it about asking the object what it meant to do before interrupted by the human who wanted from it something illogical and immediate. I do not time myself because time, inside my head, is a room I consider part of my jurisdiction.

The plant gets to be audience because it has earned it. The figure sets his small hand on the edge of the lectern and for a moment I hate myself for arranging him as if he is complicit, and then I forgive the hate because it has other uses. I speak and hear my own voice like the voice of a cousin I only see at funerals. It is familiar and not. When I finish I raise my eyes to the window and the street obliges me with the sound of a bus sighing as though impressed.

On Sunday I go to St George’s Market like a man visiting a sentence he once spoke aloud. It is the market I offered him as a favorite to make myself legible, and in the bright noise I am just another person bearing a tote bag and an opinion. Fish announce themselves with the honesty of ice. Cakes look gratuitous, which is the point. A man stalls coffee as if he invented heat. It’s not stalking because it is noon and the world is holding a general assembly; it is coincidence with manners. He is there by a stall that makes bowls which look like they would float if you asked nicely. He holds one with both hands and knocks it lightly with a knuckle to call up its tone. The sound is a small, round promise. He laughs when he hears it and says something to the stallholder that is standard market wit; the stallholder laughs the laugh that knows how to sell pottery without making anyone feel they have been sold.

His sister—luminous, less so in daylight, still a lamp—arrives at his shoulder bearing two oranges and a catalogue of sincerity. She says his name in a way that tells me I got it right about the family map, and he says hers—Niamh, soft at the edges—as if to balance the scales. They argue a little about color. She wants the blue that is not sea; he wants the cream that is not bready. He picks a bowl because it sits obediently in his hands. It is not cruel to watch this. It is a study in fit. I move on before their conversation turns to something a stranger can’t repay.

At the class, when my name is called for the demonstration, the room does its automatic thing where it makes itself a face, half attention, half patience. I stand in the place the light suggests I ought to stand and say good evening without meaning to. People smile because they have recently been instructed to mind their faces when a speaker begins. I talk about asking machines what they believe they’re for, and I make a small joke about printers as if I am handing round a bowl of sweets. I keep my chin where it belongs. I do not gesture with the right hand because the right hand would not like it; I let the left draw the arc. I watch one person in the back row who is not impressed and I make it my business not to rescue them; that is my present to myself.

He looks pleased at the end in the way a person looks pleased when something they were ninety percent sure would be fine does in fact turn out to be fine. He gives feedback that uses the word texture, which is either nonsense or useful depending on the angle. He says I trusted silence, which earns me a private ribbon in a place I pretend not to keep medals. Linda beams at me with the proprietary joy of a friend who has decided you are collecting experiences rather than people. The denim-cardigan man nods gravely. The new girl claps with her hands in the wrong shape and I find that charming.

Afterward he asks me to carry a box of handouts to a cupboard that lives two corridors away in a little republic of stationery. It is how it begins, I think, this small privileging. He walks ahead, reading a list, because he is a person who likes to pretend he doesn’t remember the code to the cupboard until the last second and then get it right. Inside, the cupboard is an archive of every good intention the department has ever had. We wedge the box between laminates and half-used flipcharts. He leans against a shelf and the metal does not complain. “You’re good at being obvious without telling people everything,” he says, and it is such an odd compliment that it feels like a small door opening, and I am careful, careful not to run through it and wreck the hinges.

“Years of practice,” I say. He glances at my right hand where it rests, innocent, on the edge of a box. “How are you getting on with—”

“With the ball, the elastic, the sermon of the thumb? I’m diligent.” He grins and nods. There is a speck of white on his cuff and I feel the itch to brush it away and do not. “I keep being told not to chase pain,” he says. “Which is difficult, because I am very goal oriented.” He drops his head and laughs under his breath. “Do you think it’s normal to want to be good at physiotherapy?”

“Completely usual,” I say. “When I was six I wanted to be good at not stepping on cracks.”

“And now?” He says it as if I am offering him a version of a man he has almost met. The corridor is quiet in that university way of knowing it is supposed to echo. I stack an extra box for the excuse of looking practical.

“Much the same,” I say. “Just better shoes.” He watches me like a person reading a page he was told would have something underlined and discovering it does not, and then he smiles in a way that admits that not everything has to be a lesson. “Leave the heavy one,” he says, and that is the kind of instruction my right hand loves.

The figure breaks by accident. I knock him with my bag, a stupid, clumsy swing I would like to blame on a noise from the street but cannot. The arm does not come clean off; it loses confidence. The elbow, that click-perfect hinge, becomes decorative. The rage I feel at myself arrives fast and thin and clean, the kind that has a knife to it and no breadth. I set it down beside the sink like a person I have grievously misjudged. The plant trails toward it with curiosity and I push the green back, stern. The tiny screwdriver is no use at the level of this insult. I go to the drawer where tape lives a shabby life and realize the mistake—the wrong kindness. I wait instead, which is a skill I respect in others and rarely practice in myself.

The repair, when it happens, is delicate as the work the physio teaches me. I warm the plastic as if resurrecting it from the idea of itself. I seat the joint until I feel the right small resistance, that whisper where two pieces were engineered to share their lives. The click when it returns is not the original click. A person not me would not hear the difference. I press my thumb into the forearm and imagine the way a tendon records injury and swings a small lantern when it thinks help is needed. “There,” I say to an object like a fool. “There.” It forgives me the way objects do: entirely, because it has no choice.

My mother phones and the conversation begins with cake. “I made a traybake,” she says as if she is confessing to something expensive. “I put too many cherries in because I was distracted, and it will not hold itself together. Your Aunt Sheila says that’s my spiritual problem in a pan.” I tell her I will come on Sunday with Tupperware. I tell her about the plant because that is safe. She says she knew I’d get lonely enough to give something else a job. She asks again, without asking, whether anyone new has taken up the good cups, and I say, “I’m making do,” and she says, “Your whole life,” not unkindly. At the end, before she hangs up, she says, abruptly, “Tell that right hand I’m not impressed,” and my laugh is honest enough I have to sit down.

The charity comedy promoter sends an email that uses three exclamation marks like a man trying to keep balloons from hitting the ceiling. There is a community night at the men’s shed off the Crumlin—yes, that men’s shed—and they want someone from the course to do the warm-up about listening and how to ask. It is as if the city has decided on my behalf. He forwards it with no pressure, which is itself a pressure. I type yes before I remember the scene with my mother describing the exact distance between her kitchen and the shed with a tea towel. When I tell her, she becomes delighted in the way certain animals flatten themselves out on warm tiles. “I’ll come,” she says, and then rescinds. “No, I won’t, you look better when I’m not there.” We agree to collaborate on a flask instead.

On the night, the hall is a collection of chairs that have seen men cry without witnesses. The kettle is a veteran; the biscuits are digestives because anything else feels like showing off. There are hammers on the wall hung as if awaiting choir practice. The men are the kind of men who look like tools put away in the wrong drawers. There are two women in the corner who are there on purpose. Irene appears with a box of polystyrene cups and the small swagger of someone who does this because no one else will. “Another night, another room,” she says, and I do not ask why she knew to come. “I love a shed,” she adds, as if this is a political statement.

He is there to make the ask on behalf of the tiny charity that is trying to make loneliness look less like a personal failing. He does the introduction with less polish than usual, which I trust more; he grins at one joke that refuses to land and the grin makes it land anyway, the way a bird will decide a particular branch is perfect despite the angle. When he says my name there is something like pride in it, or perhaps I am stealing a feeling again and calling it a gift. I stand and the room is not lit like a stage; the light is the smear you get off strip fixtures that have been curing the air for two decades. The men look at me as if I might be a test of their patience. I am.

I do not begin with good evening because that feels like an insult in a room where evening is already accounted for. I begin with a joke about pots of tea, a joke that is only a joke because I love the pot. I talk about making things obvious to save pride. I ask for a volunteer to tell me how to plane wood and a man in a blue jumper tells me firmly he won’t, and then he does, in detail, two minutes later, adjusting his hands to show the way the grain sneaks up on you. I watch my right hand try to hide and bring it to the front, a little, not enough to make it shy. I breathe the way I was taught and the air does not punish me. I say less than I planned because the room is doing half the work. It is the best kind of theft. I look toward him once because I must, and his face has the even, attending kindness of a person who knows he is not the point tonight and is relieved.

After, people thank me in the complicated way men thank strangers for coming into their rooms. The handshake problem arrives and I let my right hand be the one that sits on top of the clasp while my left does the grip. No one notices, or if they do they assign it to some trait that has nothing to do with damage. My mother’s stew tastes better reheated in my head than it will when I spoon it into the Tupperware later. Irene steals three digestives and shoves them into my coat pocket with the flourish of a magician. He claps me on the shoulder with his left hand and the touch doesn’t make me jump and for a second I am so grateful I could embarrass us both. “You’re tidy,” he says, and we laugh like thieves.

By accident, walking home, we align for three streets. The city has turned its lamps to their amber version and the halo they lend to puddles is indecent. He talks about the shed as if it is a person. “It makes more sense than most institutions,” he says. “You can see what you’ve done when you leave.” I say, “There should be receipts for good conversations,” and he nods as if pricing out carbon copies. At the corner he points up toward Botanic as if the gesture could carry him there faster. “I’ve got an early,” he says as if mornings had decided to specialise in him. “Rest the hand,” he adds, and I want to say that resting is sometimes the worst thing for a hand built to solve, but I don’t. Instead I say, “Do as you’re told,” and he makes the face people make when they recognise themselves in a sentence they didn’t expect to be in.

Back at the flat the plant has discovered the cupboard handle again and I pull it free the way you would gently steer a child away from a cliff. The figure stands on the draining board where the scratches make their private city and from the window the rain announces it is prepared to be taken seriously. I wash the cups without meaning to and line them like small, obedient planets. The right hand aches but in the way that suggests a plan. I am reckless enough to be content. I sit at the table and write down what I stole from the room tonight so that I will be able to pretend, later, I learned it myself. You have to name theft something kinder when you intend to keep doing it. Borrowing. Renting with intent. He would approve of the phrase though he would frown at what I do with it.

Two mornings later, the plant has put out a single pale root into the glass of water where I set a cutting to see if I could multiply what I have. The root is translucent and sincere. I hold the figure in my left hand and perform the physio’s exercises with my right and think, absurdly, of applying them to a joint that can only ever be perfect or broken. There is relief in a world where the options are so clean. Then I place the figure on the windowsill next to the baby plant and decide I like mess better after all.

The class collapses and reassembles around a guest speaker with hair that makes everyone nervous. He talks about crisis communication as if he has survived more than one of his own making. He tells us how to say sorry without admitting it and I watch Mr K’s mouth tighten almost imperceptibly as if sorry is a word with rules he prefers to keep. During questions, Linda raises her hand with the moral authority of a person who buys good socks, and asks about sincerity; the man in the hair dodges until he tangles himself and Mr K rescues him with a redirect so smooth it is insulting. After, in the scatter, I watch him lean on the desk, just for a moment, the right hand doing a job it has negotiated rather than inherited. The band at his wrist is new, a subtler color, the shade of compromise. I have the urge to tell him my plant is multiplying, which is not a sentence two people like us should swap, and in lieu of that I say, “Tomorrow’s clinic,” and he nods in that exact degree that says we are now in on each other’s boring maintenance.

“Come early,” he says from the doorway of his office the next week, and the way he says it makes it sound like a favor I am doing him rather than something I want badly. He has a stack of handouts that look like a skyline again. We arrange the room in a different geometry for a new game, and he lets me choose three of the chairs’ angles, which is a silly power and I use it ruthlessly. He puts a marker in my hand as if daring the right to try and it does, and the body loves the instruction, and the board loves the marker. We set two small tasks and watch the room become less of a room and more of a process, which is his trick and the trick I am learning to enjoy. At the break, he leans against the side wall and tilts his head to study me in a way that is almost professional; his lips count something invisible.

“You don’t fidget,” he says, which is not true, but has the feel of truth because the fidget is internal and most people can’t see it. “You edit.” I want to say, I am all editing, but I am not cruel enough to make that into a compliment of myself in his presence. The biscuit tin clicks shut, sincere as a prayer. Linda appears at my elbow like a conspiracy and says, “We are buying you a drink to celebrate you helping. That’s what happens with victories in our culture.” I almost say, I am not sure if I count as our culture, and her look warns me off that kind of self-indulgence, which I respect in her the way I respect a carpenter who tells me not to sand the same corner twice because I enjoy the sound.

Walking home after, the city finds its mirror-self again in every puddle, and all our faces double and refuse to confess. The figure has the dignity of an object that has been repaired near a window. The plant trails like an opinion no one asked for and everyone has. I lift the tiny lecture tie from the figure and set it beside him because tonight he doesn’t need the uniform and neither do I. There’s stew waiting for me that tastes better after it has remembered it was once a plan and now is a comfort. My phone blink-lights and my mother sends a photo of the traybake that did not cohere and a caption that says, “Eat with a spoon,” which is the kind of instruction the whole body can get behind. I think about rooms and the price of a little you and the larger one in the city who keeps turning toward the light whether or not there is anyone to watch. I think about the door that I will knock on tomorrow and the exercise that will make my right hand disobey me in a way that is the beginning of obedience. I say good evening without irony and the room says it back, which is all I wanted when I began this particular small madness, and more.Chapter Seven

It is the week of small precisions. The physio shows me a new thing with a wall and a rubber ball that makes my wrist think for itself in a way that isn’t panic. “Closed chain,” she says, and the phrase pleases me because it sounds like something that could arrest a cascade. I stand with the ball between my palm and the paint and breathe like a reasonable person while she watches the way my shoulder cheats. “It’s not a test,” she adds, because people like me pretend everything is not a test and then live as if it is. I say, “I know,” and feel the joint think in clean lines, not because I am superior to pain but because pain can sometimes be negotiated with if you call it by its name and not by the pet names you gave it when you were twenty and dramatic.

The plant takes this as its cue to throw a leaf shaped like a long-limbed thought into the space above the draining board. I find myself narrating its progress: here it learns a corner, here it forgets to be shy. I do not name it because that would be an intimacy I am hoarding for humans. The figure watches without comment, which is what I need him for. On the windowsill the sediment in the glass where the cutting sits decides to be decorative and I forgive it. I have matched the tiny cuff to the figure’s tiny shirtsleeve with a thread I stole from a packet that says emergency, and in the mornings I touch it to see if it is still there as if it might have learned to leave in the night.

The email arrives Tuesday mid-afternoon and is so ordinary in its tone that it takes me a beat to understand what it is offering. Could you open the first fifteen minutes? it says, easy as buttering bread. I’ll be late back from a staff thing. There’s a script on the desk if you want it, but use your own better judgment. He has written judgment without the second e because he is that kind of man and I love him for how the omission makes the word look balanced. I read it three times and then read my own palm on the desk, the lines that have become just another way to show age. I reply Yes with the dangerous efficiency of someone who thinks saying yes fast will turn it into something permanent. After I send, I stare at the sent folder like a person who has thrown a stone into a lake and would like to know which fish have been offended.

Linda finds me at the coffee machine like a messenger bird that has acquired a fluorescent scarf by mistake. “I heard,” she says in the tone of a person who only hears things once they can be used to cheer someone else with. “He’s roped you in. Good. You’ll be tidy about it.” I tell her it is only fifteen minutes and she says, “Everything important is only fifteen minutes,” and I try to decide whether that sounds like a threat. “Wear something with structure,” she adds, and I glance down at my coat, loyal and too dark, and think of the cold in the stitches from the old butcher’s and think that structure is not always in the fabric.

On the way to Botanic the city decides to be theatrical with its rain again; people step into the road with the resigned grace of extras who know their scene is the one where they get soaked. In the corridor the noticeboard is aggressive with flyers about a film society that refuses to die. His office door sits open on its usual angle, a promise of presence even when he is not inside it. The desk holds the skyline of pens like a small port city preparing to export sincerity. There is indeed a script, courtesy of his tidy hand: two bullet points about an opening exercise, one joke about biscuits that is older than both of us, an encouragement about attention as gift. It is useful and I will ignore it because I have learned that doing a thing exactly the way someone expects is a good way to be invisible, and tonight I would like to be seen as a person who can rent a room without knocking anything over.

The lights in 2.04 hum the way they hum when they think no one will be listening. I set the chairs a shade closer than usual because people are braver when their knees could knock if someone laughs the wrong way. I line the pens like a skyline because why offend the gods. I put the biscuit tin at the front as bait. When people come in they look at me with the guarded politeness that says, Are you the substitute teacher? and I like the feeling of being mistaken for authority. Linda takes a seat and gives me a nod that is a secret handshake. The denim-cardigan man checks his watch theatrically. The new girl—Marta, she had said last week, as if she were selling me the name on a stall—sits near the back like a person who wants to be called on and also not. The radiators begin their sermon on warmth and the windows fog to make everyone feel like they are inside a whale.

“Evening,” I say, and the room accepts the word as a ticket. It is not the way he says it; it is mine, pitched smaller, as if I am afraid of breaking it. The exercise I choose is a theft I have decided to admit in advance. “In the men’s shed,” I say, “they taught me this. Tell your neighbour about a tool you like that has nothing to do with work. If you don’t have a tool, you can lie. Two minutes each. No questions. When you’re listening, keep your hands still.” The room does that thing where it resists for the length of a breath and then someone moves and the rest follow like polite birds. I walk the back and watch hands attempt to tell the truth at their sides. People talk about vegetable peelers and the specific joy of a brush that fits under the tap and a tray that gets a roasting right every time and a pencil that hasn’t been sharpened in two years and still makes a line you can trust. The man with the cuffs too tight on his wrists talks about the small Phillips screwdriver he keeps in his car for seatbelts that decide they’re better as sculptures than as safety.

When we gather the room again, I do not ask for volunteers because volunteers are always the same people. I point at the waistcoat man, now cardigan again, and he obliges with a story about a hammer his grandfather liked to call “the persuader,” and the room laughs because they recognize themselves. I talk about listening as evidence, not flattery. I keep my right hand on the lectern because it calms the wobble and let the left draw two arcs in the air as if those arcs could be plans. When he arrives, he does it without theatre, slipping through the door at the back and standing to watch with a face that does not give away the fact that it is his room and he has come late to it. The heat rises onto my cheeks as if it had been summoned and I decide to keep the exercise going one beat longer than is proper just to prove that I am not the kind of person who collapses into a wall when the owner of the house walks in.

“Perfect,” he says, when the room gives me back and everyone looks for biscuits. The word lands near my shoulder as if he has pinned it there. “I’ll steal that,” he adds, which is the only praise worth collecting, and the lesson continues like a river that has let itself briefly be dammed and now pretends it enjoyed it.

After, when the chairs scrape and the pens lose their skyline and the biscuit tin clicks shut like a satisfied animal, he leans on the desk and watches my face for a detectable percentage of relief. “Thanks,” he says softly, because the soft thanks are the ones he likes to keep for people he has seen do a thing they almost didn’t. “You made it look easy.”

“I did not make it be easy,” I say. “But I am good at performing smoothness. The men in the shed like tools because tools tell you what they do and then they do it. People are more expensive.” He laughs in that caught-in-the-throat way and glances past me to where Linda is interrogating the biscuit tin as if it has cheated her.

“You free after?” he asks, and the after is complicated enough that my heart writes a two-paragraph memo while my face arranges itself politely. “I have another thing,” he adds quickly, seeing the possibility of a misread, and the ghost of embarrassment crosses his temple like a cloud. “Next week. A community group in Derry. I usually take one person to help run the small groups. If you’re interested.”

I do not make the mistake of asking if he is asking me. I look at the ground as if it contains a timetable. “I can be interested,” I say, and he grins because he recognizes the shape of that yes and respects it. “I’ll email,” he says, and then he is pulled away by the waistcoat man who has decisions to make about socks and whether they are aggressive enough for leadership.

In the toy shop the bell remembers my weight. The man with the helmet hair looks up from a magnifying glass that makes him look like a resident of a bubble. “You again,” he says, and we both like how much that makes it sound like a feud. There is a new accessories rack with things no one needs and everyone wants: a tiny laser pointer, a set of preposterous cufflinks, an absurdly minute name badge that says facilitator in a font dignified enough to be satire. I buy the name badge because if I am to be ridiculous I prefer to be precise about it. “We got a complaint about the elbows,” he says, confidentially, like a man whispering gossip about a madness. “Too tight. They’ll loosen them on the next run.” The relief that moves through me is not righteous but it is mine. I walk out into a wind that has discovered its own ambition and put the small badge in my pocket where it sits, a ridiculous weight against the seam.

My mother decides that bearings require her intervention. “If you’re going up to Derry,” she says down the phone, as if the motorway were a boy she once danced with and couldn’t trust, “you’ll take a sandwich. The services don’t taste of anything but someone else’s regrets.” I tell her I am not certain I am going, and she says, “Then I’ll make two sandwiches and throw one out to teach you a lesson,” and we are both pleased with ourselves. Before we hang up she says, abruptly, “Your father’s hands were never good for writing but he could fix anything. You didn’t get that from him. The fixing, yes. The writing, no.” I say, “I can write neat as a judge,” and she says, “Exactly,” as if she has won a point in a game I did not realize we were playing.

The clinic has become a kind of chapel. I arrive early to sit with the cartoon spine and pretend to read. He comes out as I go in, and for a moment we occupy the same patient space, neither of us the person running the room. There is an elastic cuff at his wrist the colour of compromise and it suits him. “You?” he says, and I show him the ball, the band, the willingness. He says, “I know that homework,” and I grin at the way the word makes what we are doing sound like a problem you can get full marks on if you copy carefully enough from the back of the book. “Derry,” he adds, as if it is a country he has to ask me to visit. “It’s light. They’re better than most rooms at being rooms. We’ll be back before you can hate me for the playlist.” I say, “As long as it isn’t a playlist that announces itself,” and he says, “I am not a monster,” and the physio opens the door and we stop being funny.

In the class the next night the heating forgets itself and the windows do not fog and everyone notices one another too cleanly. He runs an exercise with numbers that makes the room become a machine for a minute, each person calling out their digit not in order, trying not to collide. It is the kind of game that reveals the person who wants to own the room and the person who wants to watch it be owned. I do well and pretend to do less well because that makes people like you more. Linda cheats politely; the new girl forgets to speak and then makes up for it by speaking three times at once, which is a talent. At the break he stands with his back to the board and the chalk has made a constellation on the navy of his cardigan. “You’ve chalked yourself,” I say as I pour tea, and he rubs his shoulder like a man who has been told about wings.

After, because people need pints to prove to themselves they’re not fragile, Linda insists and I let the bar receive us. Irene raises an eyebrow and I show her the tiny name badge at the bottom of my pocket and she barks a laugh that startles a pair of men who thought the world was theirs. “Wear it to bed,” she says, and I say, “It’s safer to wear nothing to bed,” and she says, “Who told you that,” and we behave ourselves. There is no sign of him and that is better; sometimes the night needs to be mine so that I do not become a thief with a taste for only one house.

At home I trial scripts for Derry on the kitchen table like a man trying on voices. The figure keeps his position with a dignity I envy. I put the tiny badge on his lapel and the comedy of it is so perfect I feel the urge to take it off immediately in case the joke turns mean. The plant’s new tendril reaches toward the cupboard handle and I redirect it for the third time, gentle as bureaucracy. I catch myself speaking aloud to both of them as if their silence deserved my sentences. “We’re not stalking,” I tell the figure. “We’re collaborating.” I tell the plant, “You’ll trail if I let you,” and then I go to the sink and wash my hands as if my words could reside on them and become visible under running water.

The morning of Derry, my mother rings to ask if I’ve remembered my address in case the guards pull me for trying to be interesting. “It’s not the seventies,” I say, and she says, “It’s always the seventies somewhere.” I take both sandwiches because the lesson would be wasted otherwise. He picks me up at the corner because he is being generous with petrol and because the city has trained him to keep track of who owes what. The car is a small sensible square with a dash that thinks it is modest. His playlist is indeed boring, which is a relief; songs that behave themselves, which is how people describe him when they mean polite. He drives like a person who has memorised the rules so that he can break them elegantly and never once in a way that would cost points. We talk about nothing on purpose. He points out a field that is not actually a field but a memory of a field under a carpark at Toome. I mention the river wreaking its own logic and he tells me a story about being submerged up to his waist once because he misread a path near Prehen. “It taught me to pretend I did it on purpose,” he says, and I want to ask if that is how all the best things in his life began.

The community room in Derry is bright in the way of a space that refuses to be embarrassed by linoleum. A wall of windows shows a car park that looks like a gallery of ordinary decisions. The chairs are yellow with hope. He does his careful thing with introductions as if he is conversing with the walls as well as the people. I take a small group and pretend not to notice that one of the men has the kind of face that tells you jokes are not to be trusted. I talk about listening the way the physio talks about joints: as if there are better messages we can send if we start from the centre. I watch a woman who has spent twenty years being told she is too much take up half the room without asking anyone to forgive her. I say the word calibration like a man lighting a candle. He roams like a person making sure all the cables are plugged in and occasionally stands where I can see him for a fraction longer than courtesy demands.

At lunch I sit on the edge of a low wall and eat my sandwich while the wind decides what direction belongs to it today. He sits two feet away and opens a tub of couscous that looks like a mistake and eats it anyway because he is committed to his choices even when they are grains. We talk about the tone of rooms. “Some rooms want to be forgiven,” I say, and he says, “Some rooms will only learn if you make them laugh first,” and we give each other the look that people give when they have been honest enough for a Tuesday. He asks, as if he has been holding the question like a coin he might spend, how my father would have liked a place like this. “He didn’t like chairs in rows,” I say, and he laughs at the right amount of distance. “Mine did,” he offers, and then he shuts it before it becomes a eulogy.

The afternoon is the kind that looks like it will go wrong and then decides to co-operate. We finish with a circle he hates and I tolerate because circles have a way of making all the wrong people look like saints. When it’s done he does the small magic trick of ending a session without making a meal of it, and people clap not because they have to but because they know how to signify a morning they are willing to remember. The drive back is quieter. The sky makes decisions about colour without consulting us. He takes the long way to avoid a lane he does not trust and I decide to trust him for that as if it were a bigger test than it is.

Somewhere before Antrim he says, without preface, “I had a figure,” and the word sits between us like a confession. “Someone gave it to me, years ago. As a piss take. When I—” He pauses and the pause is a little private corridor. “When I thought I was becoming the sort of person who needed a lectern to speak to people I could have talked to across a table. It was meant to make me less pleased with myself.” He laughs into the windscreen. “It worked. For a bit. I lost it in a move. I used to keep it near the kettle and feel superior to it and then less superior.” He glances at me and the look is not an accusation. It is a measuring of what kind of man I am. I say, carefully, “Sometimes a small you is a way of practicing for the day you have to be the larger one. Without breaking anything that bleeds.” He nods as if I have told him a true thing and then the road insists we pay attention to a junction.

He drops me back at the corner with the same precision he collected me. The city is the kind of wet that makes your face feel like a separate object. We do the ritual exchange—text me when you get in; tell me if the room calls you back—and then he does the thing my right hand has been waiting to test: he reaches like a man who has learned to ask with his eyes, and I give him my left on purpose, and the clasp is soft and exact and my right is spared and I do not have to explain. “Good,” he says, not to the handshake but to the working of a tiny piece of his unseen rubric. “You’re good,” he adds, and the word lands somewhere in the centre of me like an instruction that the body is happy to obey.

Back in my flat the plant has insinuated itself midway across the cupboard door and I laugh out loud because persistence is a joke when it is someone else’s mess to tidy. I move it back with the kindness you are supposed to have for growth and it sulks in green. The figure stands on the draining board with his badge like a priest making a joke about absolution. I tell him about Derry and how the chairs were yellow and how a woman in a cardigan told a story that would have broken me ten years ago and today I put it down gently and left the room intact. I wash the small badge and dry it with the corner of the tea towel like I am cleaning a medal I did not earn. The right hand flares and then falls quiet, persuaded, for the moment, by the promise of a ball and a wall and a woman who believes in teaching tendons to speak more kindly.

At my mother’s on Sunday she hands me the traybake like a verdict. It is as delicious as a collapse can be. Aunt Sheila sits in my father’s chair and glares at the radio for playing a song that refuses to apologize for itself. “Your man on the wireless,” she says, “said that listening is hard and I said, ‘Try shutting up,’ and your mother told me not to shout at inanimate objects,” and my mother says, “If he ever meets you he’ll be sorry he refused a warning,” and we laugh a family laugh that admits nothing and everything. Somewhere between tea and the ritual accusation that I am getting too thin, she asks, pointed but skirting, “Is there someone minding you who is not me?” I say, “Yes,” because it is true in a way that does not require her to buy biscuits, and she hums approval and tells me to take the good Tupperware.

In the class, after Derry, he asks me to hold a thread and I end up weaving more of the cloth than is dignified for someone not being paid. The room has learned the shape of my voice. When I catch myself thinking that, I forgive the vanity because self-knowledge is sometimes a decent meal if you don’t make anyone else eat it. The exercise that fails is my fault. I ask too much from a room that hasn’t decided to be brave. The silence is not the kind that can be trusted. He rescues it with a small, stupid joke that goes over, and when we are alone packing pens back into their skyline, I say, “I asked for an honesty they hadn’t warmed up,” and he says, “I should have laid the floor for you,” and I like that he thinks in floors and not ceilings.

On the way out we stand at the top of the steps and consider whether the rain deserves our bodies. He says, “Come with us on Friday. We’ll do the men’s shed again but in a different shape,” and I say, “You make me sound like a piece of furniture you can bring if the room needs to look finished,” and he grins and says, “Exactly,” and I make a face at him and we do not make more of it than that. Linda catches up and tells me to wear the good socks and I find I own no socks that yet deserve that adjective. Irene texts a photo of a pint next to a book with a title that promises advice and a caption that says, Tell your man to stop pretending he hasn’t read it, and I send a picture of my plant in reply and the words, He’s trailing, and she hearts it in a way that makes me feel thirteen.

Sometimes the city stops to let you notice it. Ormeau Park at lunch is a paper green and the swans have learned not to be splendid for people who don’t earn it. The teenagers are less loud than they are intent; a boy kicks a ball against a wall like he is spelling. The right hand behaves if I ask nicely, which could be a philosophy if I believed in philosophies. On the way back a man outside the church offers me a leaflet that is so sincere I take it and read it and fold it and put it in my pocket so that someone’s effort can live with my fluff for a while. In the office the printer tries to die again in a melodrama and I save it with an instruction spoken like a lover’s name. The spreadsheet woman brings me a new biscuit and a story about a man who apologised to her stapler and I tell her she is the only reason I believe in other people’s competence.

It is Irene who sees it first. “Your right,” she says, gesturing with her chin to the cuff that has become a part of my wardrobe like a lie you forget is not your skin. “You’re different with it. It’s behaving like a tenant that learned the rules.” I tell her about the ball and the wall and the woman who waits for the tremor and congratulates it and she says, “I’ll clap for your sinews if you start preaching in a bar,” and she means it. In the mirror behind the bottles I catch sight of my face and it is not handsome and not poor and looks like a person who is learning a language without the accent. That will do.

The toy shop has a small sale the way churches pass a second collection and hope you will not add up the coins out loud. There is a tiny stool that would fit a figure’s rest. I buy it because at this point there is no sense pretending I am not building a room. Helmet Hair Man says, “You’re curating,” and I want to argue because curation is a way of putting distance between yourself and your preference, and I am not distant. But the word is correct. I am arranging small true things to practice for the day when I might stand in front of larger ones and not flinch.

There is a photograph on his desk that changes without fuss. The child with the football is now a child with a book, caught mid-page, concentrating with all the arrogant sincerity of someone who has not yet learned to pretend they are bored. I do not ask whose child. It could be a nephew, a godson, an old version of himself in a second frame. The coast remains the same and that, too, is a choice. The spider plant has sent a runner down the side of the shelf and I can see the paperclip he used as a stake. He catches me looking and says, “It wants to go somewhere,” and I say, “Everything does,” and his mouth does the crease like it’s finding its job for the day.

The night we take the shed in a different shape the room is warmer and the men are less suspicious, which is to say they tell the truth sooner and then regret it less. He gives me the piece where you ask people to introduce each other instead of themselves and it always goes better than anyone expects because we are kinder describing a person than describing our own mess. He hangs back for once, his right wrist behaving like a boss who has learned to delegate. At the end he says, to me, at the sink where the mugs pretend to be new each time, “You should,” and stops, then begins again in a different key. “If you wanted. Next term. Co-facilitate. Properly. Money.” The word money is a small grin on the end of a sentence he knows I will say yes to without it. I ask for time to pretend to be modest. He gives it to me like a man lending sugar.

On the way home I pass the Lanyon building and for once it does not look like a grammar exercise; it looks like a book with the wrong blurb, read anyway. The rain has managed to make streets into scripts again and the traffic is slow enough to admit that it doesn’t always know what it is doing. In the flat the plant has finally reached the cupboard handle and I give in and leave it, because sometimes you have to let a thing hold on to what it wants so you can see if it meant it. The figure sits on the small stool like a person who has decided not to leave a room just because the light went odd. I take his badge off and place it beside him because tonight he has earned the right to be only himself. I pick up the rubber ball and press it against the wall and listen to my joints talk sense. The radiator ticks its inside joke. The city leans against its window and watches us like it hopes we’ll look back and wave. I do, a little, and the night forgives me my sentiment because I am careful to keep it indoors.

At some point after midnight I wake and find the figure on the floor, on his back in the geometries of moonlight. It is not a ghost, only gravity. The right arm has held. He lies there with the blank practicality of an object doing what objects do. I pick him up and return him to his stool and the smallness of the motion contains everything I have yet to admit. In the morning I will set him by the plant and the two of them will trail and attend, and I will walk to work in a city that likes to double me and refuse confession, and I will say good morning in a voice I have earned. And if the body loves an instruction, as she says—if it learns to obey what is kind when you say it enough times—then perhaps there are versions of me that will do the same trick on command. Perhaps that’s what I have been learning, under the lectures and the biscuit lids and the apparitions on slick glass: to move cleanly toward the part of the room where the light is not a threat.Chapter Nine

The city changes its mind about winter the way a person changes their mind about a joke halfway through telling it. The cold acquires new teeth; the air discovers angles; the light finds reasons to do the old tricks as if they were fresh. I put my hand to the glass in the mornings to let my skin learn the facts. The plant has taken the cupboard handle in both hands and I am letting it, the way you let a child win a small argument so you can keep your strength for the larger ones. The figure sits on his stool with the badge beside him like a medal taken off after a shift, and sometimes, before I leave for work, I straighten his tie even though I have sworn not to make even the smallest human gesture toward an object that cannot refuse it.

Paper arrives with meaning on it: a proper email with a rate that looks like a joke because no one gets rich telling a room to say what it means and then showing it how. There is a university header with its formal Latin; there is the outline for the term; there is my name where it needs to be to make it harder for someone to pretend later that this was a misunderstanding. I pretend I am confused by formality because it lets me enjoy the relief longer. Linda sends five messages that amount to one loud noise. Irene replies with a picture of a champagne flute in front of a wall of gin with the caption, You’ll hate the money but you’ll love the chairs. My mother says, after a pause that is mostly sugar, “Well then. Now I can tell Aunt Sheila to stop saying you fiddle about with computers like a man who never left the garage.”

There is a meeting to sign things that makes me feel like a person other people have decided to believe in for the length of a term. He has a new cardigan the colour of an apology and two pens fatter than my thumb because he has opinions about nibs. The administrator who witnesses our handwriting is brisk in the way that suggests she has learned how to forgive signatures that look like weather. I write neatly because habit should be rewarded; he writes like himself, which is to say with a steadiness that probably took work to acquire. “You’ll do the second halves,” he says, marking the paper with a finger as if he could annotate reality, “so I can do the beginning and then vanish and come back when they’ve decided to like you more than me.” I say, “They’ll like you better for letting them like me,” and he makes a face that is unflattered and not entirely unhappy. On the way out he shows me where the spare markers live, an act of intimacy in his language. “Guard these,” he says, solemn, and I take the cardboard box as if it houses something endangered, which it does.

The physio moves me on to a sequence with a towel ring and the instruction to press and release without performing either as a miracle. “Control,” she says, not in the way of someone who enjoys saying no to people, but in the engineering sense: input, output, reasonable expectations. “Your shoulder wants to do the work of your hand because it believes in the dramatic gesture,” she adds, and I like her for diagnosing me without making it a wound. After I leave I carry the towel ring in my head until it becomes something I examine when waiting at pedestrian crossings. My right hand surprises me twice that week by not trying to run away when it meets a body in a corridor or a bag on a bus; I thank it without telling it that that is what I am doing. He appears in the physio lobby once, hair damp from rain, cuff an understated blue. “I can now open jars,” he announces softly, like a prophet resigned to domestic prophecy, and I say, “Remember us when you become a god,” and the cartoon spine looks disapproving in the way only a red drawing can.

The first paid evening I arrive indecently early and pretend to those who notice that I am tidying when really I am making bargains with other people’s chairs. The room feels like a church that has been asked kindly to become a hall for one night: willing, but with reservations. I place the pens again in a discreet skyline and run my thumb along the ridge of the biscuit tin as if checking for fault. He arrives without ceremony because he doesn’t need it; he puts his bag on the table and takes out the handouts and the ritual gathers itself around this movement. “You’ll be fine,” he says, not the useless fine that deposits people in trouble, but the kind of fine that sustains like bread. “I’ll be here and then I won’t and then I will again,” he adds, and there is the sense in the room of a trapeze being checked for its minor wires.

They are a new mix, the faces: two students whose mouths have not yet learned to hide themselves; a woman who has made the first row her right; a man whose attention looks like a muscle he only uses when he has to; a pair who have arrived together but are pretending to the room that they are not. The exercise that sets everything in motion is one I have come to admire because it respects people’s unease while asking it to move out of the way. He does the first ten minutes like a conductor waking an orchestra up to itself. Then he makes the leaving look like a rearrangement of breath and I am in the light in the way I have always insisted I didn’t want.

When I stand to begin my mind springs a list and I allow it to scatter; I pick three pieces out of the air and let the rest fall, which is a risk I would not have taken a year ago. “Tools that are not tools,” I tell them, smiling at the woman who has brought her scarf as if it were an argument. “What do you pick up when you need something to behave?” They talk about hands, first, as people do, and then about voices and then about the look they make with their mouths when they need someone to be less stubborn. I make marks on the board that pretend to be frameworks; in my pocket the rubber band sits like a quiet friend who knows when not to speak. I forget myself twice and then remember quickly; I show them where to stand when they want to be believed, how to sit when they want to be forgiven, the way a question can be asked with a head rather than a throat. I do it with my left hand doing more than its share because the right is still proud, and in the fourth row a man with a smile like a diverted river leans forward and I have the neat, mean thought that this, this leaning, is a better coin than whatever will arrive in my account on the twentieth.

After, the room becomes the gentle ocean rooms become when they have been asked to be more than chairs and have agreed. He returns cleaner than he left, in that way he has, not breathless, but differently paced, as if he has walked somewhere that made him reconsider his stride. He takes up the biscuit tin the way a person takes up a role and I let him, because it is his to own. “You did not break the room,” he says to me, low, amused, pleased. “Good,” I say. “It’ll need breaking next week,” he adds, and we both understand that this is not about mischief, but about design.

The figure, at home after, receives the report with his usual diplomacy. I set him by the plant because success, even when modest, should not be hoarded on a single shelf. The plant has taken the handle and I cannot now open the cupboard without performing a soft violence. I perform it gently, rearranging vines like sentence halves, and apologise to leaves as if they keep minutes. I tell myself it is not peculiar that the house of a single man can contain a lectern smaller than his palm and a plant that has learned bureaucracy. I sleep well that night and when I wake I mistake the ache in my right hand for an alarm and then discover it is only truth.

In a week the world decides to do snow properly for three hours, the kind that surprises us and makes people tell stories about the last time as if it were a beloved guest you hope not to see too often. The city looks dirty in white, which is an honesty I admire. On Botanic people slide without shame and we all become the same age for a minute, the age where your body is the joke and you are allowed to laugh. The class makes it in wearing wet ankles. He begins with a story about a time he did a presentation in Cork and the heating failed and all anyone could think about was their breath, and the class laughs because we have all survived rooms without air. Halfway through the second exercise the power does the inevitable local theatre and leaves. We stand in a dimness that has the mercy of being universal. He raises his voice by one notch—only one—and the room obeys because it wants to. “We can do it without slides,” he says, as if he had planned to prove this point. There is something in the way his outline takes up the dim corridor of light from the door that makes my mouth want a sentence I don't say. I speak instead to the group I am supposed to be shepherding and we steal a vowel from the hallway and train our ears to care. We finish with a circle we can barely see, and in the low light a man at the back tells a truth that would have looked too earnest under fluorescents. When the power returns like a bashful child, the room does not cheer. The click of the biscuit tin is louder than the building's hum.

I go to his office with his spare markers and find the new photograph on his shelf so familiar that for a second I feel the oddness that happens when the brain insists it put an object down somewhere else. It is a beach I have not walked—flat light and a line of people in the distance who might be birds until you see the way one of them holds their arms. The spider plant is attempting independence again and he has disciplined it with a paperclip and a stern memo. “Do you collect coastlines?” I ask, because that is the kind of question that will not break anything. “They collect me,” he says, and then, a beat later, “My sister has decided to acquire opinions about frames. I made the mistake of praising one and now I must admit that I have tastes.” He smiles the smile of a man awkwardly gay for teak. “Niamh recommends large white borders,” he adds, and there is a softness to the way he says her name that makes me file it under Single Proofs That Matter.

We go to a school gym on a Tuesday afternoon because community work looks like this: faint smell of gym varnish and older rubber; two nets wound against the wall like polite snakes; a caretaker who despises the idea of anyone scraping a chair across his floor. The girls turn up last and then transform the room, the way teenagers do. They are all bite and feign and sleeves. He makes himself smaller and their attention increases, because they are clever animals and know the difference between a person performing authority and a person who intends not to harm them. My role is to run the games, which is a sweetness I do not deserve. I teach them how to ask for what they need without peeling themselves raw; I show them the two centimetres back from the edge where you can still breathe. When one of them cries she does it in a way that scrubs her face with humour, and the others are gentle not because they are good but because they understand precarity. He and I exchange a look across a diagram of cones and chairs and in the look is the practicality of two people supervising a miracle that must be allowed to believe it did itself.

He has a cold for a week that makes his voice a little lower and his eyes a little brighter and me a little worse behaved in my head. He does not cancel anything, because of course he doesn’t. He drinks lemon like repentance. I tell him to rest as if I owned the right to instruction and he grins and nods and then continues to schedule his body as if it were a train line that runs even on bank holidays. In a staff kitchen I find him leaning against a fridge with the aesthetic of a child’s drawing and he looks at me as if he has been waiting to ask me a tiny question that is not small. “Do you ever get bored,” he says, and I love him for offering me the courtesy of latitude. “Of what,” I say, honest, because boredom is a field, not a point. “Of people,” he says, adding quickly with a small hop of politeness, “I mean in rooms. Not… not people.” I consider lying and then offer him the decent version. “Not if I am building something,” I say. “If it’s only maintenance, yes. But there are days when maintenance is a kind of construction.” He nods and looks relieved of a sentence he didn’t want to carry alone.

There is a Saturday where I do something dangerous and useful and entirely mine: I take the figure down and put him in the drawer under the cutlery with the old packets of sauce and the tab from a can I keep meaning to throw away. I do it without ceremony because ceremony would tell on me. I count three heartbeats after the drawer closes and feel both lighter and affronted, like a man who has been handed a smaller coat and told it suits him. The plant takes the news better than I do; it occupies the corner with that accurate, shameless concern for light. After an hour I open the drawer and check, because superstition pretends it is love when left alone too long, and there he is, the plastic perfectly itself, not improved by my attention, not deteriorated by the lack of it. I close him away again and my right hand pulses its opinion and then calms under the ball and the wall.

On a Sunday my mother tells me her left knee gave way on the step and she sat down because she refused to fall. She says it as if this is a story about the weather; it is not. She says, “I’ve made my peace with the good knee doing double shifts,” and I say, “We could go to a person who persuades knees,” and she hums and changes the subject, which is how she says give me time. Aunt Sheila wants to argue with the radio about birds, which is the kind of argument the radio appreciates. I look at the chair and do not sit in it, not because I am haunted and dramatic, but because grief asks you to acknowledge the shape of a thing without touching all its surfaces. Before I leave, my mother presses a Tupperware into my hand as if it were a passport and says, “Tell your man with the voice that if he ever wants to be bored with stew he is welcome,” and I say, “He would eat with a spoon,” and she laughs in the old way and calls me a fancy man.

A small scandal arrives disguised as an email with a subject line that sounds like an apology. Someone complained in a class about being asked to talk to a stranger, and the complaint grew arms and legs in the manner of the modern world. He reads it in my presence and his mouth performs the precise discipline he has practiced for years. “We will, of course, respect discomfort,” he says into the general air, and then he says, “This one will be my reply,” which is not to say he is leaving me out of the work, but that he intends to stand in front of the room if anyone begins throwing chairs. “Do you mind anger?” he asks me as if he were offering a biscuit I could refuse. “I respect it,” I say, which is true and also a way of saying that some kinds go in the box with sharp lids and some kinds you leave open to the air until they forget their tricks. We adjust an exercise that would have been good and becomes better because a person who could not yet bear being seen has taught us another doorway.

In the bar Irene invents a drink to name after the men’s shed and it tastes like wrong decisions made neater. She listens to me explain the complaint with the cheer of a woman who knew this would happen and wanted to know what I would do. “You’ll have to grow a thicker skin,” she says, tossing her braid and a tea towel with the grace of a cavalryman, “but don’t grow it over your hands. I like what your hands do.” I show her the elastic band and she nods as if I have offered her a religious relic. “Keep stealing rooms,” she says, as if theft were the sincerest form of praise. Linda offers an opinion about apologies that makes me want to eat with her in bad cafés for the rest of my life.

We go to a conference at the end of the month because it seems we must, and it is held in a hotel that pretends it is not a hotel by placing books on shelves near the bar. The chairs are too plush to forgive nervousness; the carpets would absorb a confession without leaving a stain. He is scheduled for a panel that will ask him to be both precise and amusing. I have been given a plastic lanyard with my name spelled almost right, which is professionalism’s way of telling me it has noticed. The keynote speaker says very reasonable things about leadership as if we are all responsible for everything, and I take notes in a neat hand and draw a tiny ladder in the margin because the thought requires scaffolding. He sits beside me for ten minutes, fidgeting only with an invisible score in his head, and then stands to go and perform and I imagine for a moment that I follow him like a shadow he has purchased.

When he speaks he gives away his tricks in a way that makes the room feel clever, which is the best trick. He talks about rehearsing sincerity without making it a lie, about eye contact without theft, about the stupid, beautiful labour of building a story you can stand in without catching fire. He does not tell the figure story, not because he is ashamed of having once tempted himself with a small version, but because today the room is not in the mood for toys. He says, “The body loves an instruction,” and I hear the physio’s voice in his and permit myself a private, cheap joy. The panelists pretend to argue and then realise they agree and the moderator tells us we have been a wonderful audience and we all nod like people who know our place in a liturgy.

In the corridor afterward a man with a suit that makes him look more official than his eyes approaches, pleased with himself. “You do the courses,” he says to him, the you too large, the tone too sure. “Had my son in one. Good stuff. Talked more sense for a week after and then became himself again.” He laughs and the laugh is not kind and not unkind; it is a noise that says, I have no truck with transformation. He accepts the compliment and declines the joke and we move on. In the lift, he leans his head against the faux wood and says, “There is a kind of praise that feels like being reminded your rent is due,” and I say, “We pay it with interest,” and he stops the lift with a finger just to see if the feeling goes away. It does not. He starts it again because he is a man committed to resuming motion.

In a week the complaint evaporates, not because we are right, but because the person found a kinder place for their fear to sit. He prints out the final email and puts it in a folder with other small survivals. I like that he keeps paper, the way sailors used to keep dried oranges and knives. We adjust the room again in small ways to permit more civility. I learn to see the moment in someone’s eyes where humour looks like a threat and I step left and offer them sense instead. He watches me do it and afterwards says, “You’re learning to be boring in the right places,” and I say, “You’ll make a teacher of me yet,” and he does not flinch.

The plant begins to yellow at the edges because I have been ferocious with light. I dilute my ferocity and see it forgive me, slow as rightness. The figure stays in the drawer for a fortnight and I feel both disloyal and greatly sane. The house seems bigger without the tiny lectern on the table, as if the object had been performing a small gravity. On a night when the wind performs Swahili outside, I take the figure out for five minutes and tell him what he has missed and he says nothing because that is his gift to me. I set him back gently, making no promises, not even the promise to be ridiculous again tomorrow.

I go to my mother’s without being summoned and she pretends not to notice the novelty because to notice would be to mark it and to mark it would be to loosen it. We walk slowly to the shop and back and she teaches me the geography of the pavement cracks, all the original routes her right knee prefers. She tells me that Aunt Sheila has taken up crosswording competitively and is insufferable, and I tell her that a man in a cardigan cried because he remembered his father’s hands, and she tells me to bring him a traybake because sugar does what tears cannot. In the kitchen we stand on either side of the table and I take the good knife and chop onions because that is what sons do when they remember that grieving can be turned into dinner.

The class becomes comfortable with me and that is a risk, because comfort pretends to be trust and then forgets to do the difficult things. I bring in an exercise that smells like trouble and we do it anyway. He watches from the corner with the quiet of a person who knows exactly how much rope to offer and when to pull. He lets me falter once and I find the edge of the stool with my hip and recover and a man at the back says, “Well,” and I say, “Yes,” and we leave it at that. After, the woman with the scarf—now green, a new season—tells me I should press my voice more when I say the words you want people to steal, and I nod and write it down in a notebook whose pages are more patient than I am.

At the end of the month, on a day with a sky like lace, he sends a message that says simply, Home? and an address, and an apology afterward as if he has invited me to break into his house and would like to minimise the offence. It is for a delivery he cannot be there to receive. “You are entirely allowed to say no,” he adds, which is exactly the sentence required to make me say yes. The house is the right kind of ordinary: a narrow hallway that manages to welcome you without being smug, a staircase that sighs in the right place, a carpet that forgives shoes. The parcel is not a surprise; the shape suggests a lamp or a promise of a lamp. I sign for it with my left hand and place it at the base of a bookshelf that holds more cloth spines, more neat borders. On his desk there is a list with a ticked box for physio and a second box empty where it says Call Niamh re: frames. On the windowsill a small bowl sits with two coins and a note with a child’s handwriting that reads simply Here, Uncle, which is so exactly human that I put my fingers on the edge of the sill and breathe.

I do not trespass. I let my eyes skim the surfaces and leave fingerprints nowhere. I tell the house I am friendly to it and it believes me in the way houses believe cautious men. I text him a picture of the parcel leaning against the wall and the emoji that makes me look more at ease than I am. He replies with a thank you that sits the way his thanks sit: modest, exact, not more than the truth and never less. On the way home the city feels more legible, as if a new street has been added to a map I thought I had completed. I do not tell the figure because some things are too large for plastic; I tell the plant, and it leans as if to smell the door I have walked through.

There is a moment in the men’s shed where he has to leave for a call he cannot avoid and I hold the whole room for twenty minutes and no one notices the seam. It thrills me and I am ashamed of it because the thrill is ego and the shame is a kind of pride. When he returns he does not reclaim the room so much as stand in it and nod, and that is the skill I would like to steal next: the art that says, I do not need to be visible to be present. In the bar after Irene raises the glass she always raises on nights like this and says, “To small gods and useful men,” and we all laugh because it’s blasphemy and it works.

The cold retreats as if embarrassed. The city relaxes its shoulders. The plant goes cardiac with enthusiasm. The right hand forgets twice and flinches; the third time it does not. He buys a new mug with a crack mended in gold, a craft I had only seen on the internet, and when I admire it he tells me its name as if I needed a foreign word for an ordinary skill. “Kintsugi,” he says, careful with the consonants, and I repeat it and we both pretend we have loved it longer than the last minute. He puts the mug on the windowsill to catch the afternoon that the building spares us and I can see his satisfaction rise like steam. “People love a wound turned into decoration,” he adds, and I say, “Sometimes it is not decoration. Sometimes it is a warning sign made pretty so that you will let it stay in the house,” and he says, “Yes,” so softly I pretend I didn’t hear.

In the drawer, the figure lies among the sachets and the string from paper bags I cannot bring myself to throw away. He has not minded, because he cannot. The badge, cleaned and dried, sits in the shallow bowl on my own windowsill next to a coin with a hole in it my father let me keep when I was nine. I roll the elastic band up and down the fingers of my right hand while the kettle opals in the corner, and when I take the ball to the wall I can feel the shift, the small, friendly change, the way joints begin to interpret my requests as sensible rather than panicked. The city the other side of the glass argues with itself in consistent dialects and I forgive it because I have learned how to be consistent and still become someone else.

On a night when the show is nothing and the room is generous, he waits with me outside the university and the rain decides to be theatrical again just to remind us we live under a sky that likes attention. We stand under the tiny shelter and he tells me a story about a first class he ever taught, the panic, the kindness of a woman who asked a question not because she needed the answer but because she wanted to let him inhale. I tell him a story about a boy who slapped the back of my head and how my right hand has been writing essays about him ever since, and he does the move where he pretends to look down to kick a stone and I know it is because he does not want to write his face on mine. We do not touch. We do not. But the space between us becomes the distance between two points that have decided what kind of line they would make if given a ruler.

The invitation to Derry arrives again and this time I do not think to say no. We sit in a car that smells of upholstery and clean and neutrality and listen to the rain write on the roof, and every now and then he narrates the names of the places the way a man would if he were teaching someone else how not to get lost. I watch the road and feel the articulation of us, the clicks and stops, the bend and release, and do not mistake it for something it hasn’t promised to be. If this is a hinge, it is at least one I have consented to. If this is a small piece of a room turning into a home, it is one I am building with screws I know by the feel. The figure in the drawer sleeps. The plant trails. The body loves an instruction and sometimes, if you are lucky, so does a life.
