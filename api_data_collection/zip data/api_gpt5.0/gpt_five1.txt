The first gull of the morning told the hour better than any clock. It skimmed the edge of the cliffs and shrieked at nothing in particular, bits of wind making it suddenly tilt like a paper plane that someone had just remembered to throw. Down below, the town stirred in its old way: buses groaned awake near the square, shutters clattered up along Old Christchurch Road, a handful of silhouettes scuttled to jobs that began before the sun registered its contract. And on the east side of town, lights winked at Bournemouth Airport's perimeter fence as if the night itself had forgotten something and turned back for it.

Tom Hatherley lived three roads up from the sea where the salt crept up the stucco and painted flowers had more luck than the living ones. His flat was the top slice of a Victorian terrace that had pretended to be fashionable for so long that no one could tell the difference anymore. He kept a map of the south coast above his kettle and the kettle's name was Maud because she sighed before she boiled. These were simply facts. That morning he woke with a tune in his head—some stubborn, tinny chorus from the radio that had been chirping about a weekend festival—and lay there counting a string of imaginary runway lights until his mind clicked into the checklist rhythm: coffee; shave; uniform; lunch; a glance at the weather in a language only pilots and fishermen still used.

He said good morning to Maud, to the map, to the photograph of his grandmother beside the sugar jar. She wore an apron in that picture and was leaning on a wooden spoon as though it could be recruited for anything: stirring, pointing, scolding, drumming out a jig. The spoon had the same notch it had always had where it once encountered a stubborn piece of toffee and lost an argument. Maeve Hatherley had taught him the difference between crumbly crust and soggy bottom before the nation had turned it into prime-time entertainment. She’d pinched his elbow when he rolled shortcrust too thin and slapped his wrist when he tried to sneak off with a spoonful of mincemeat at Christmas. He'd adored her for it, and he still kept her recipes in a biscuit tin full of strange clippings: handwritten measures, smear marks of custard that had fossilised, a postcard from Bridport where she'd complained that the sea air ruined meringues.

His phone chimed with something cheerful and ordinary. He had three messages from Izzy, because Izzy never sent one thing when she could send three. Are you really up? Do not wear that tie with the little planes; it makes you look like a tour guide. Also, weather says low cloud over Jersey. The last was a photo of a gull staring balefully at her through the airport café window.

He tapped back, Already up. Proper tie. Hello to your gull.

The gull did not reply. Izzy sent a kiss emoji and then the serious next bit: Ops moved the first leg forward ten minutes. Captain Patel says report at 06:15.

He wrote Thanks, skimming the glass with his thumb as if to smooth out the worry it held. Ten minutes wasn't much but it was enough to make the town feel different as he left. The seafront smelled like damp toast. A single jogger gave him a nod; the nod was shared among early risers, a secret handshake of the reluctantly virtuous.

By the time he crossed into Hurn the sky had turned a colour he never entirely trusted. It was that milky, indecisive light that might be fog and might be nothing, the kind that lied to you halfway across the Channel. His pass beeped green. The security guard yawned and then, as if embarrassed on behalf of his own mouth, said, “Morning, Tom.”

“Morning, Phil.” He smiled, signalled with his empty hands, with his pilot’s particular brand of politeness that always seemed half borrowed from school assemblies. The crew room smelled of uniforms. It always did, somehow, a blend of pressed wool and the faintest ghost of the spray that some of the cabin crew wore when they were brave enough to ignore the no-perfume thing. Captain Ramesh Patel was already there, reading a paper and holding it the way only men brought up by very tidy mothers held newspapers.

“You’re nearly late,” Ramesh said without looking up.

“We start earlier every time just to make me feel that way.”

“You think the world revolves around you?”

“I think it tilts slightly. Toward Bournemouth, at least.”

Ramesh folded the paper and pointed at the weather printout. “Low-ish cloud, but nothing adventurous. QNH 1018. Jersey is pretending to be mysterious but will reveal itself on short final as usual. We’re full.”

Tom glanced over the passenger list. The names meant little—until they did. He’d learned that in enough seasons of flying strangers to places where the plaque on the wall mentioned Victor Hugo. Sometimes you read a name and it rose above the ink: somebody who laughed too loud, someone who cried quietly, someone who needed to tell you about their dog as if you were a barman with wings. He let his eyes drift, caught on a name—M. Greeley—and moved on. Maureen Greeley? No, that was coincidence. Bournemouth had a dozen Greeleys; they were born in a barrel somewhere down on Poole Quay and rolled inland as required.

In the cockpit, the plastic still retained a hint of cool. He ran through the preliminaries with Ramesh, checking the oxygen, the instruments, the transaction of ritual that made this small aluminium tube into a trustworthy thing. When he spoke to the ground on the radio his voice dropped half an octave and borrowed an extra ounce of calm. He didn’t know why. Perhaps the radio ate nerves and required you to feed it a confident voice in exchange.

“Solent Skyways 302 to Jersey, requesting start.”

The reply came with the clipped civility of a person who’d long ago fallen out of love with coffee but kept drinking it out of habit. “Skyways 302, start approved.”

They threaded their way out to the runway as the light decided that, yes, it did intend to be day after all. The take-off was smooth and almost too easy, the turboprops purring as if the air was buttered. Bournemouth slid away. The patchwork of old roofs and new builds, the stubborn line of the pier, the sudden open hunger of the water. He thought of the inland roads—Poole, Ferndown, the bit where the New Forest leaned in and you could feel the change in the trees like a change in the tone of a voice—and felt the old tug of two places at once, the earth and the air.

“You with us, Tom?” Ramesh asked, one hand light on the yoke.

“Just thinking about pies.”

Ramesh turned his head enough to play surprise. “At this hour?”

“It’s never the wrong hour to think about pies. My grandmother approved thinking ahead. ‘Always plan pastry the day before,’ she said. ‘Otherwise it sulks.’”

“Your grandmother had opinions on sulking pastry?”

“Fierce ones. The pastry section was practically politics at our house.”

“Do you take after her?”

“God, I hope so.”

Ramesh smiled and then put the plane to a tiny little bank, as if to show respect to the invisible border where Solent became open sea. “I’m not saying you shouldn’t eat whatever you want,” he added after a moment, “but the way you’ve been going on about this pie thing. Don't let it distract you.”

“It’s a community event. It’s not like I’m running off to join a band.”

“Community events are where people show their worst selves. Little magnifying glasses for mischief. Who runs it?”

“The Wessex Hearty Pies Festival. Mrs Clegg runs it. She looks like a person who would make you tea that would fix your life.”

“Name’s familiar,” Ramesh said, squinting as if he could see the list of Bournemouth’s formidable women printed on the horizon. “Is she the one who told the mayor his chain was vulgar?”

“That was Maureen Greeley.” He laughed. “She used to be in charge of the market. She tried to regulate the number of stalls selling fudge. Said it brought down the tone. She’d be ostracised if it weren’t that every charity thing she touches turns into more money than sense. Anyway, Clegg runs this. But Greeley will be there. She always is. Her hats arrive five minutes ahead of her.”

“That’s it,” Ramesh said. “Greeley. She’s flying today. Saw the name. You’ll be very polite if she comes up to the cockpit.”

“I am always very polite. Look at me.” Tom lifted his chin to demonstrate the existence of his good boy face. It made Ramesh laugh again, and the air was a place for laughter the same way the kitchen was.

They hadn’t much of a climb before they skimmed along that slab of grey-white that maybe wanted to be cloud, maybe wanted to be theatre. Jersey revealed itself in the end the way Ramesh had predicted, the runway gliding out from the cotton of low cloud like a ribbon you only noticed when the wrapping had already begun to fall away. On final, Tom felt his shoulder muscles relax in that way they always did, as if something had personally forgiven him.

Passengers deplaning is a ballet if you tilt your head and squint. They move in choreographed disorder, and you catch the little dramas: the couple arguing in whispers about a hotel booking, the child who refuses to walk and becomes a sack of child that must be hoisted, the lady with the hat that makes neighbours out of anyone within six seats because they have to physically navigate their way around her.

Maureen Greeley did not wear a hat. That was the first surprise. She wore a scarf that looked like it had been set on fire and then forgiven. She had a face built for authority, which is to say every line in it had been earned on purpose. When she stopped at the cockpit door, he stood up because you stand for Maureen Greeley without deciding to.

“Airman,” she said, the word like a salute made of biscuits. “I don’t normally bother the flight deck, but I thought I’d look a friend in the eye. I’m Maureen.”

“I know,” he said, and felt his ears heat with the simplicity of it. “I mean—Tom. Hatherley. Welcome to Jersey.”

“They tell me you’re a local. Used to pop into the market yourself in short trousers.”

“I still do. Pop in, I mean. Not the short trousers.” He trailed off with the dying agony of a joke that knew it was terrible on exit.

She smiled anyway. “You’re the one who won the wildcard. For the contest.”

He blinked. “You know that?”

“I know everything about this town that matters. And a wild card is the thing this festival needed. We can’t always have Carstairs winning because he’s got a jaw like a crocodile and no sense of poetry. What’s your strength? Steak? Chicken? Something obscene with chocolate and cream that is frankly a tart in fancy trousers?”

“Steak and oyster. My grandmother’s.”

“Maeve Hatherley,” she said, as if reading the name off a monument. “You see. I know things. She was a terror and I adored her. Baked all during the winter of seventy-nine, didn’t she, and disappeared under a loaf of bread every Thursday.”

“Every other Thursday,” he said. “Kneading days.” He could smell his grandmother’s kitchen in that second, the kitchen that had been small only to people who didn’t know how the walls moved when you needed more room for laughter. He swallowed something that didn’t want to be swallowed. “You knew her.”

“I know this town. So we’ll see you in the ring next month. Show these boys what a pastry with standards looks like.”

“I’m not sure ‘the ring’ is quite the term,” Ramesh said dryly from his seat.

Maureen flashed him a grin. “Oh, but it is. They gnash and gnaw like it’s the last meal of the last day. Good fun for charitable causes. Tell your colleague not to look at me like I’m a roman general; I pay my taxes and then some.”

“We’ll be good,” Tom said.

“You, Mr Hatherley, will be fast. That’s all you need to worry about. Do not, under any circumstances, eat anybody else’s food unless you saw it made. The things people will do for a ribbon. There’s an ethics workshop to be had some day.”

She vanished down the stairs with an energy that made the exit itself look like part of a performance. Ramesh side-eyed him. “See? Magnifying glass.”

“She was—” He groped for the word.

“A weather condition,” Ramesh supplied. “Fine. Do not eat anybody else’s food unless you saw it made. Good advice for both pilots and pie people.”

On the second leg home he thought of nothing but pastry. Or rather he thought of everything and it all sifted through the sieve of pastry. He thought of how his grandmother would cut fat into flour the way she went at her rose bushes: with tenderness that involved stealthy brutality. He thought of how every July some baked thing would achieve its own texture beyond intention. “The air is wrong for it,” she’d say, mournfully. “The air in August is sloppy.” He thought of the other contestants. He knew Trevor Latchford by reputation and by the specific queue he caused every week at the Saturday market: a swing of the belly and a confidence that made thin men wary. Latchford had won two years running and only once had he thanked the person holding the trophy. He had not, famously, thanked the charity who’d put up the banners. The photographs of his victories showed a face like a loaf bored with being bread.

At the same time as Tom’s plane kissed the runway back at Bournemouth, a coach coming in from Yeovil, with a banner for the Wessex Hearty Pies Festival flapping from its suitcase compartment, ground its gears and hissed into a parking space by the pier. The town did what it always did, trying to decide if it was cosmopolitan or coastal; it failed artfully and nobody minded.

Izzy met him in the arrivals corridor with paperwork and the sort of smile that said she had already triaged crises and beaten two of them to death with a stapler. She had one rebellious curl that always, always escaped, and when she tucked it back he wanted to say: leave it. But you cannot dictate to hair or to people whose hair is making a point.

“You survived,” she said.

“I’m indestructible. Also I promise I didn’t wear the plane tie.”

“Shame. The cabin crew were placing bets.”

“How much would I have won?”

“Oh, I had you down for five-to-one in favour of the tie.”

“Betrayal is in the air.”

“Along with the smell of chips from the snack bar,” she said, wrinkling her nose. “You coming to lunch? Or are you training?”

“Training?”

“For the Discipline of Pies,” she said, solemn, capital letters audible. “Don’t pretend you aren’t thinking about it. The way you look at pastry when we pass Marks & Sparks is borderline indecent.”

“That’s a slander,” he said. “But, yes. Lunch. Though not too much. Got to save room for—”

“For being very serious in front of flour.”

They ate fish and stole each other’s chips. He told her about Maureen, and Izzy performed a Maureen impression that was dangerously good and made the man at the next table laugh through his napkin.

“She warned you,” Izzy said, in the end. “About other people. She always does that. It’s her favourite subject, other people. People are her favourite animal.”

“You make her sound like Attenborough.”

“She should present a show.” Izzy took the last chip and looked unrepentant about it. “So. You actually are going to do this. You’re going to sit under lights like you were built to feed. Doesn’t that put you off? All those eyes.”

“I fly people,” he said. “They look without really seeing. Same thing on the ground. It’s more honest with pies.”

“Everything is more honest with pies.”

He grinned. “Anyway, I’m a wild card. If nobody expects anything, I can do anything. That’s the law.”

“It’s not the law.”

“It’s a cousin of the law.”

“Still not legally binding.”

Later, in his flat, he lay on the couch with the sea ghosting the windows and the radio turning itself down until it was only bass. The biscuit tin was in his lap. He sorted his grandmother’s recipes with an attention he usually reserved for checklists and family photographs. Her notes were bossy, her handwriting extremely clear; it turned a person into a student whether they wanted to be or not. On the page with Steak and Oyster, her pencil had left a firm instruction: Oysters if you can get proper ones. Otherwise, don’t lie to yourself. Use mushrooms and use silence. The silliness of that hurt him a little.

He bought flour and beef and a jar of oysters that a fishmonger on Holdenhurst Road eyed as if it knew secrets. It took him a whole afternoon to turn kitchen into warm weather. He put out an extra spoon and glanced at it sometimes as though the hand that should hold it was late, or would walk in if he waited. He talked to the oven when it begged for patience. He did not answer when his neighbour banged on the wall to tell him anything and everything—music, footsteps, time—was too loud when you had a hangover. He wrote a message back on a Post-it and slid it under their door: My nan made me do it. I’m sorry. It was ridiculous and he knew it.

By evening, he had two pies, one that looked obedient and one that looked as if it had been reared in a loving home and given options in life. He cut into the second and let the steam rise. He tasted it with a degree of seriousness that might have been slightly comic if anyone had been there to witness it.

“Not bad,” he told the air. “Hot, though.”

He wrapped wedges in parchment and carried one across to Izzy, who opened the door in socks and a T-shirt with a cartoon tortoise that looked like it had regrets.

“You’ll be the death of me,” she said, accepting the pie like a person being handed a hazardous material. “Come in. The tortoise is watching opera.”

Inside, her flat was chaos in a very deliberate, curated way. Books were stacked as if they had been auditioning all day; a scarf draped itself over a lampshade as if to make a point about lighting. He left his shoes by the door and took a slice of pie when offered. They ate with forks and stood because chairs made it too formal and they were not that sort of people.

“This is good,” she said with her mouth full. “It is simply good. Your nan was a witch.”

“Don’t let Maureen hear you.”

“She can take it. Maureen can take anything and turn it into a public meeting.”

He had to admit it: he wanted this. Not the festival, not the ribbon. The act of making something that could be eaten, shared, praised without confusion. Flying had a shareable glamour but the presentness of it belonged to him and the machine and the sky. Landing was a quiet triumph when done properly, a loud tragedy when not. There was never applause from people who mattered, and if there was applause, it made him wary. But this—a pie placed on a table—was applause without noise. Or rather it was a noise you could hear: knives against plates, sighs that had no words.

On Sunday he went to the park and ran slowly enough to be lapped by tiny, fierce pensioners. He stopped to catch his breath by the rugby club and stretched badly in a way that would have made professional people scream. Someone’s dog came and sat on his foot as if he’d been given an appointment with it. He thought about practice. Was there such a thing as training for fast eating without exactly becoming an idiot? He’d Googled it, then got spooked by the words expand and strategy, and shut his laptop like a window in a storm. His grandmother looked down at him from his memory. Don’t be a fool, she told him as clearly as if she were standing by the park bench. Eat like a person. Remember there are other years. He nodded to the sky like a lunatic, then realised a woman with a pram had seen him do it and smiled at him as if they shared a secret.

“Morning,” she said.

“Morning.”

“Talking to an imaginary dog?”

“Worse. My grandmother.”

She laughed, and the baby in the pram made a noise that suggested indifference or cosmic wisdom. It was hard to tell.

At the Monday briefing Ramesh started with weather and then put his reading glasses on to peer at him in a mock-profound way. “I’ve done some research.”

“On the aerodynamics of pastries?”

“On your ridiculous festival.”

“You don’t approve.”

“I approve of anything that doesn’t set fire to my plane. But there’s something else. You know the Carstairs fellow? The one the lady was saying had a jaw like a crocodile?”

“Trevor Latchford is the jaw. Carstairs sells combs. He runs the hardware stall that doubled as a romantic counselling service for a while until he said something about spanners that offended the wrong person. He had to issue a caged apology.”

“I stand corrected. Anyway. Latchford. I know him.”

“You do not.”

“My cousin’s daughter married his brother. I went to the wedding. It was in a hall that smelled of cauliflower whether or not there was cauliflower in it. He can drink, he can shout, he can put away three helpings and a custard in under eight minutes. He also thinks he deserves to win as a reward for having a face.”

“Good,” Tom said. “Good to know.”

“I’m saying: usually a man like that has a friend who’d sell both his grandmother and yours for a ribbon. Be careful. People do strange things for prizes. They will come in the night and salt your sugar.”

“That’s a Latin phrase if ever I heard one.”

“I am full of Latin phrases.”

He kept telling himself it was a silly thing. But the lines of tension formed around it all the same, the way cracks form around a house and you keep pointing them out to yourself as if you could keep them from inviting water. The first formal heat—what a ridiculous phrase, the whole town using it without blushing; heat—was Saturday, two weeks away. That gave him enough time to think himself into tangle. He would have to be careful about what he ate, how he slept, how he flew. His body made announcements to him. Hello, we are in our thirties. Please do not attempt to become a circus.

In the meantime, the town did what towns do: spread rumours and bake. Flyers sprouted on lampposts in colours nature would envy. The betting shop on Gervis Place took unofficial odds in the early afternoons while pretending to do nothing of the sort. The bakeries in Southbourne and Boscombe tried to outdo each other with window displays that made pastry into art and art into pastry. Someone filled a phone box with pumpkins. A local poet wrote a poem about sausage rolls and was legitimately proud of it. The radio presenter with excellent teeth began saying the word ‘savoury’ too often. Izzy sent him pictures of a life-size pie sculpture that three teenagers had made out of cardboard; they had scrawled There Is More To Life Than Pie on the side and then, under that in smaller script, Probably.

He took his grandmother’s spoon to the market, for luck. It sat in his inside pocket like a talisman and poked him occasionally where he could feel it and adjust. Mrs Clegg spotted him by the fish stall, pointed at him and then at the sky, and he nodded as if to say that, yes, he bore both responsibilities. She was a barrel-shaped woman whose hair was always in a state of shock and whose voice could cut pastry by itself. When she spoke your name it felt included in a register somewhere. “Wednesday evening,” she said. “St Stephen’s Hall, six o’clock. Don’t be late. We’ll draw lots and measure mouths.”

“Measure—?”

“I’m joking,” she said. “We do not do that until the semi-final.” She thumped his arm and moved on.

There were people he knew and loved in that market and there were people he knew by posture and tone. The old men who sat by the edge with their hands wrapped around cups of coffee. The teenagers who treated a Saturday as a promise. The mothers who looked like a miracle and a fury at the same time. He loved them all, most days. He loved how they gave him back to himself in the crossfire. But when he turned the corner by the jam stall, he ran into someone who coalesced like a storm cloud: Latchford in the wool and flesh. Trevor had a scarf wound round his neck in a way that had to be the work of hands to whom subtlety belonged in a museum. He grinned, which to Trevor meant flattening his mouth in a way that made you worry for his teeth.

“Ah,” Trevor said. “The little airplane boy.”

“Good to meet you too,” Tom said, because politeness was a strategy and also a set of muscles that worked even when other muscles failed.

“That your name in the paper? The wild card?”

“That’s me.”

“You’ll have fun. Nice crowd. Town loves a novelty act.”

“Not a novelty act.”

“No?” Trevor tilted his head as though a fly had landed on his ear and he was being kind to it. “Heard your nan had a good hand with pastry. Shame you don’t bake in the event. That would be something, to watch you cry over soggy bottoms.”

“We don’t need to bring anyone’s grandmother into this.”

Trevor smiled again and said nothing for a second that felt longer. Then he leaned closer and lowered his voice in the way bullies think is parental. “Just remember, little plane. It’s a small town. People are loyal, but they like to see a lad peeled. Don’t go making a fool of yourself.”

Before Tom could respond with any of the well-rehearsed words in his head, someone else slipped between them: a woman about their age with a courier bag and a face that did not ask your permission. “Stop breathing on people,” she told Trevor.

He straightened. “I wasn’t.”

“You were and I am in a public health mood.” She turned to Tom. “You’re Hatherley. You work with my cousin in Ops.”

“Izzy?”

“Different cousin. Everyone’s everyone’s cousin. Bournemouth is basically one big messy wedding.” She stuck out her hand. “Rowan. I run Errand Boy. We fetch things, in case you’re too busy or too embarrassed to fetch them yourself. I’m also on first name terms with the market pigeons. Don’t trust that one.” She nodded at a pigeon that clearly would have stolen a ring if it could.

“Nice to meet you,” he said, dizzy with introductions.

Trevor made a noise like a cough. “Enjoy your training, plane.”

He moved off with a pair of friends whose coats matched the colour of their opinions. Rowan watched him go and then pulled a lemon from her bag and bit into it as if it were an apple. “The trick to this town,” she said, mouth puckered, “is never to be hungry and never to be late.”

“I’ll work on it.”

“You’d better. People are betting on you.”

“Are they?”

“Yeah. The woman at the dry cleaner gave me ten-to-one odds while I was trying to get mustard out of a suit I don’t want to talk about.”

“I don’t want to talk about it either.” He grinned. “How do I train without looking like an idiot?”

“You can’t,” she said. “You either train and look like an idiot or you don’t train and look like an idiot. You may as well develop your idiot craft. I’ll bring you water. We deliver water too. Not just secrets and lemons.”

That evening back at his flat he set out plates and divided things into types: savoury, sweet, everything in between. He made notes with a diligence that would have surprised any teacher who had ever taught him. He did not eat until he was ill, because he was not yet that person—he hoped never to be that person—but he drank water at measured intervals and tried to balance appetite and speed with the grace of a drunk learning ballet. Izzy sat on his kitchen counter with her feet tucked up and timed him with her phone, shouting random facts like a quizmaster to distract him, which mostly made him laugh and choke and then pretend he hadn’t.

“Favourite biscuit,” she yelled in the middle of a mouthful.

“Digestive.”

“Colour of the mayor’s car.”

“Blue. No, black. Blue-black. Politician.” He swallowed, coughed, thumped himself in a fashion that did no good but felt purposeful.

“Name of the first girl you kissed.”

“Lucy in Year Nine, behind the hedges.”

“Excellent,” Izzy said. “You’re going to be a marvel of both trivia and indigestion.”

Later, she washed up with a seriousness that matched his. “You don’t have to prove anything,” she said, handing him a tea towel as if it were a weapon and they were going into battle. “Not to me. Not to the ghost of your nan. Not even to Maureen.”

“I know,” he said. He did. Mostly. But the part of him that had loved Maeve’s laugh wanted to hear it again. He wanted something like applause to stand in for grief because he was a small, human thing and small human things made strange trades when they were only half awake. “It’s just, maybe I can do something here that isn’t about holding steady. Maybe I can be—”

“Messy?”

“Fast.”

“Fast is easy. Kind is the trick.” She hung the tea towel in its proper place because she believed in proper places the way Tom believed in checklists. “Anyway. Wednesday. Don’t be late.”

He wasn’t. He arrived with ten minutes to spare and nearly collided on the steps with a boy of about eighteen whose eyes had that lit fuse look some teenagers carried; they could set the world on fire and would be delighted to do it for you if you asked nicely. The boy held the door for him and Tom said thanks and filed away the face because he felt like a detective on some nights, compiling his own small registry of who had been where when.

St Stephen’s Hall was the kind of place church raffles went to become significant. Obedient rows of chairs had been set out; a table at the far end held pitchers of water and a hamper of apples that looked like they’d been given a little talk before the event. Mrs Clegg stood behind a lectern as if delivering a sermon. Beside her, Maureen’s scarf had chosen to represent fire again. Trevor sat in the third row with his arms spread like a man on a throne. Rowan perched at the back with her lemon.

Tom took a seat at the end of an aisle to give himself a line of escape. In a corner, someone had propped up a hand-painted sign that read THE FINAL, in letters that had to be taken seriously on account of their own enthusiasm.

“Right,” Mrs Clegg said. Her voice did not require amplification; if she’d stood at the top of Old Christchurch Road she could have run the whole town from there. “Ground rules, you scallywags. No drugs—” she paused and added almost tenderly “—of any sort. No performance-enhancing tea. No bribery. No sabotage. If anybody so much as looks at anyone else’s plate with intent, I will personally have them removed and placed in the stocks outside the library, metaphorically speaking. This is for charity. We are not savages. We are saints in silly hats.”

Someone laughed; someone else barked agreement in an accent that had lived on three continents before settling on Dorset.

Maureen leaned forward. “And we are a community. Which means we will be awful to each other in private and defend one another in public. Keep your nonsense to your own kitchens.”

“Now,” Mrs Clegg said. “Lots will be drawn for order. Last year’s champion goes third in the first heat because if we let him go last he will faint from the weight of his own self-importance.” She did not look at Trevor and, because she did not look at him on purpose, the effect was an arrow to the knee.

Rowan waved two fingers in the air, and when Mrs Clegg nodded at her, she said, “Any word on the pies themselves? We got categories or surprises?”

“Local producers,” Mrs Clegg said. “Ethical meat, even more ethical vegetables. Pies will be blind. No one’s going to know who baked them—”

A groan rose from the congregation as if they’d practiced it.

“Don’t be dramatic,” Mrs Clegg said. “Blind to keep us honest. You win what you win. The final will be The People’s Pie. That one we’ll make in-house. Any of you caught hovering around my kitchen door will be told off by me and then by the Lord.”

Tom felt the ridiculous flutter in his stomach at the word final, as if someone had whispered it into an underlit room.

Maureen lifted a paper with names on it and began to call them out. “Hatherley,” she said, on the third name. “You’re in Heat One. First chair.”

Tom stood, nodded awkwardly in the way of a man who suddenly remembers his arms exist, and sat down again. He felt eyes measure him. Mostly kind eyes. Mostly. He breathed through it. He had flown in weather that seemed to want to write his name with lightning. He could do a village hall.

Afterwards, after notes had been handed out and the apples had been moralised out of the hamper, he lingered. He examined the sign. He shook hands with three men named Chris. He told a woman from Christchurch that he admired her earrings and spent seven minutes learning about her niece in Poole. He waited until he could speak to Mrs Clegg without being rude and then did, telling her he was honoured, he was ready, he would not let her down. She smacked him on the arm with the fairness of a coach. “The only thing you can let down is yourself,” she said. “Nobody else cares as much as you think they do. Remember that. This is a silly, serious thing that we do to raise money so a child can read and a man can get to the hospital on time. We will dress it up in nonsense because nonsense is proper. But remember it’s nonsense. And do not make yourself sick for it.”

“I won’t,” he said, though the fib rested on his tongue like a coin. “Thank you.”

On his way home the air felt sharper, somehow, the lights on the pier doing their best to show off. He walked along the promenade long enough that his toes began to mutiny against his shoes. He passed couples holding hands like they were on a raft. He listened to the waves practice their sentences. A boy ran past him with a kite that refused to recognise the concept of ground. He looked at the sky until it was just a shade lighter than ink and tried to locate the part of himself that believed in the glory of eating too fast in public. It was there, warm and small, like the first night light he ever had. He didn't trust it. He wanted not to trust it. He decided, in a moment of adult virtue, to call his mother.

“Thomas,” she said, which is what mothers say when they are about to make you remember having a full name. “How are you?”

“I saw Maureen Greeley.”

“She’s a force for good. Or for something. Don’t let her volunteer you to run anything.”

“She nearly did.”

“And how’s flying? And the—” She cleared her throat. She had agreed to let him talk about pies if she was allowed to call them ‘the thing’ in a tone that suggested they were a winter illness. “—the thing?”

“I’m first in the first heat.”

“You’ll be brilliant. Your grandmother would—I don’t know what she’d do. She’d make sausage rolls with puff pastry so perfect it would make you cry. She wouldn’t tell you that you were brilliant though. She would say ‘hurry up with your mouth’ in the way she used to.”

“She would,” he said. He leaned against the rail and watched a boy throw pebbles like time. “I wish she were here.”

“She is,” his mother said in the unanswerable way of mothers. He closed his eyes; he believed her in the way people believe weather forecasts. Some things you make true by behaving as if they were.

As he hung up, a man brushed past him in a hurry. The man had the scent of cold smoke and the impatient bow of the shoulders that belonged to nurses and thieves. Tom almost lifted his wallet to make sure of it, then laughed at himself for being the sort of person who turned a promenade into a mystery. He looked back once and saw nothing to see. Just a man, the night, and a small town trying on another version of itself.

In the days that followed he learned that training did not stop being ridiculous because you called it training. He kept it private because something in him insisted that public dignity be preserved in small ways. He measured things he would never otherwise have measured. He refrained from late-night curry and early morning bacon. He learned how much water is something and when water is suddenly too much. He went to work, he flew planes, he listened to Ramesh tell stories about a cousin who believed in the healing properties of unripe bananas. He wrote pie lists on Post-its and then put them in his pocket and then forgot about them and then found them again at security in a way that made the guard lift an eyebrow.

He said good morning to Maud, to the map, to his grandmother’s spoon. He said goodnight to the town like it could hear him. He watched Izzy fix things with a stapler and a look. He watched the sky, because he was the sort of person who believed the sky had expressions. He watched his own hunger like it was a creature he could train. He did not yet know that there are hungers older than our cleverness.

On the Thursday before his first heat, he stopped at the Copper Pigeon because he liked the way the place pretended to be older than the concept of beer. The landlord was the kind of man who shook your hand like trust was a thing he carved in wood. There were locals who had gone to the trouble of becoming interesting characters so they could bother less with being real. He didn’t stay long. He drank a soda and lime because he had school in the morning and then he stepped back into the evening, the smell of charcoal from somebody’s grill sneaking around corners.

A message flashed on his phone from an unknown number. A photograph of a pie. Its crust was uneven and beautiful in a human way; somebody had cut slits in it in the shape of a fish. Underneath: For the pilot. Good luck. The sender’s name made a shape he couldn’t immediately place: Caro.

He typed back, Thank you, and then deleted it because replying to unknown pies in a public street made him feel like the sort of person he was not. He put the phone away. He walked home with his hands from childhood in his pockets, fingers moving like they were counting stones. At the corner by the greengrocer’s, he stopped and looked into the sky, and the sky looked back with that unreadable expression he loved. Tomorrow, he told it, half to himself, and the town listened the way towns do: amalgamated, indifferent, caring in the round.The gull that thought it was a town crier came back and did its civic duty, and the morning listened with the resentful obedience of a teenager. Tom lay for a breath longer than he meant to and let the sound make a map in his head: cliffs, buses, the square, the airport’s fence lights, the bit by the pier where something intangible always seemed to be running late. He said good morning to Maud and let her sigh her way toward being useful, and while she muttered he checked his phone in that modern way that feels like taking a pulse that isn’t yours. There was a second message from the unknown Caro, sent at two in the morning, which felt like a time that belonged to fishermen and regret. It wasn’t a photograph this time but words that sounded like they knew how to shrug: Don’t let them rush you. The crust listens to confidence. He stared at it until Maud made the small click that means one more second and the water would complain about cruelty, and then he set the phone facedown as if it were capable of watching him and forming an opinion.

He took his coffee to the map and told Dorset that today he would be reasonable. He promised the map to fly with the part of himself that did not panic and to eat with the part of himself that did not pretend. In the crew room Izzy was already half an hour into everyone else’s morning and had the look of a person who had taken a bureaucracy by the lapels and explained to it how paper worked. She raised her eyebrows at him in a way that implicated sleep, pie, and male foolishness in a single polite question. He told her about the message and did not pretend it had not unsettled him just because it had been kind. She said that he needed to tell Rowan rather than pretend the town was a blanket and the blanket knew his name, and then she stuck a Post-it to his folder that read DRINK WATER, IDIOT, and kissed the air by his ear in the very specific way of people who had agreed on a border and were too fond of one another to test it often.

Ramesh had weather in one hand and a joke in the other, which is how he liked to brief. “You’ll enjoy today,” he said, peering over the rims of his glasses like a man examining a new species of pastry. “Bumpy on climb, smooth at altitude, dramatic clouds that will make the cabin take photographs and ascribe personalities to them. We’re in and out of Alderney if her ladyship decides to be visible enough to land. How’s the stomach? Still in training for the Glorious Folly?”

“Steady,” Tom said. “I have reached detente with bread.”

“Good. Do not attempt detente with weather. That never goes well. Also, a cousin of mine texted from Poole to say her neighbour’s hairdresser’s boyfriend’s mum knows you’re first up in the heat. You are now officially a civic asset and a public liability.”

They flew the short hop and the air did exactly what Ramesh had promised it would do: it huffed at them on the way up like a cross aunt and turned velvet when they were far enough above it to forgive. Alderney sulked behind a veil and then chose, at the critical moment, to behave as if she had company. On approach Tom watched the water change colours in stripes and let the instrument panel steady the tiny impatient animal behind his ribs. He moved in the tightness of rehearsal into the looseness of trust and came away with a landing that felt like a handshake you wanted to repeat. Ramesh nodded in a way that men nod when they know praise is a precious metal and must be used sparingly to retain value. On the way back the radio knit its necessary magic and they found themselves again at home with tyres that whispered instead of shouting. It would have been a good morning to be content if contentment had been a thing the town allowed before nine.

At the edge of the arrivals corridor, while the ground crews were doing their ballet with cones and tug trucks, Tom reached into the inside pocket that had developed a small permanent bulge. He had been doing it habitually since he’d put the spoon there the first time, the way a boy checks his lucky marble even when he has agreed with three separate adults not to be superstitious. His fingers closed on lining and air. He checked again with the kind of methodical denial he could have borrowed from checklists: left pocket, right pocket, bag, useless little pocket by the hip designed for coins and memory. He felt the absence like a sinkhole. He told himself he hadn’t brought it today, that he’d been sensible last night and put it back on the shelf by the biscuit tin. He ran home lunch hour fast in his head and saw himself do no such thing. For a moment he was ten and the thing he wanted was at the bottom of a pond and the water was telling him to be reasonable.

He did the reasonable thing; he went to Rowan. Errand Boy occupied a corner unit that had once housed a shoe repair and before that some version of a draper’s; it kept the smell of leather and dust the way old men keep grudges. Rowan sat on the counter with a clipboard and the face of a woman who had run half a marathon before breakfast and the other half while someone else thought about toast. He told her about the spoon and watched her posture change the way you watch the posture of a cat when it realises a mouse has been gauche enough to exist in its jurisdiction. She asked him, without fuss, when he last touched it and where. He told her about the promenade and the man with the cold smoke smell and the way the evening had felt like it was practising being kind. She pursed her mouth like a person tasting a lemon and trying to decide whether to propose marriage. She slid off the counter, shouted to someone in the back to cover the phone, and began to make calls with the rapid, soft voice of a person ordering an emergency from friends.

Within ten minutes she had woven a net through town with string you couldn’t see. She spoke to the Copper Pigeon, where the landlord remembered a man with a jacket that pretended to be tweed and a watch that had belonged to somebody else. She spoke to the bloke at the key-cutter’s who swore he’d seen a spoon with a notch go across the counter at the pawnbroker’s by the bus station before the shop had decided that the spoon wasn’t a thing and not worth the negotiation. She spoke to the boy from the church hall steps, whose name turned out to be Fin, which was too neat a name for a boy with that much beginning in him, who said he’d seen a man at the end of the pier hold something like a conductor’s baton and smile like the sea had told him a joke. There was a fifth call to someone she called Auntie Mags who wasn’t her aunt and wasn’t called Mags but who knew, through channels the rest of them would distrust if they were not born here, that a man named Fitch had been around the boxes behind the pawn shop and liked to move things that didn’t belong to him between pockets until they felt they did.

By the time she had turned her phone facedown and decided not to look at it again until it needed to be looked at, she had a plan that was not so much a plan as a tone of voice with legs. She told Tom to go to work and to answer his radio without pretending to be a hero. She told him to drink water because Izzy would have wanted her to. She told him to stop looking at the door like the spoon would walk in if only he made it feel welcome. He felt stupid at being this shaken over a piece of wood, and then he felt angrier than he meant to because some things carry more than their own weight and it is not weakness to understand physics.

He flew the early afternoon like he was writing lines with a fountain pen and he came home to find an envelope pushed under his door with the neatness of a person who cared about corners. Inside, there was a clipping from a newspaper so old the letters looked like they had grown there. Maeve Hatherley, pictured with a bun that could have been classified as architecture, holding a plate that had once been a pie and was now a victory. The caption said something about the church fête and the year when the library had first decided to have opinions. There was no note to say who had sent it and why. He sat with it and felt the way you feel when someone else picks up your memory and cleans it for you and leaves it on the step like a parcel. He put it back in the envelope and put the envelope under the biscuit tin because he didn’t know where else to ask it to live.

In the morning the town woke up with the particular eagerness of a Saturday with a thing in it. He had not slept badly but his sleep had not been democratic; it had spent more time with the parts of him that worried and not enough with the parts that planed edges. St Stephen’s wore its best hall smell; the sort of smell that thinks it has something to do with wood polish but is really made of coats and hymn books and the specific sweat of people who take charity personally. Mrs Clegg moved through the space like an icebreaker in a polite sea and addressed an army of volunteers like a general whose soldiers will receive both medals and jam. Maureen’s scarf had changed its mind about fire and declared itself a storm cloud, and Tom thought perhaps she was rationing flame for later.

Ramesh turned up without warning and offered a handful of mints with the semi-seriousness of a man supplying ammunition. He behaved as if he had wandered into this by mistake and then became, when Izzy arrived with coffee and lists and a hairpin between her teeth, the sort of man who stands where he is most useful without being asked. They found a position by the side wall where they could be supportive without becoming scenery. Rowan appeared with a brown paper bag folded at the top and a face that didn’t want to give anything away in case the giving would make the world think it could take more. She handed him the bag and told him not to spoil the moment by apologising before he’d even opened it. The spoon inside had a new scratch and an old dignity and the notch was exactly where his palm knew to expect it. He put his thumb there and felt his chest do something stupid that he forgave immediately. Rowan told him that Auntie Mags had spoken to a man who spoke to the pawn shop owner and Caro had been the one who walked in making a noise that meant don’t. He tucked the spoon into his jacket pocket and told Rowan that he owed her in the sort of currency friends accept; she told him that he owed the town, which he could repay by behaving himself and not making them all look daft.

Caro introduced herself ten minutes later by saying his name as if she knew it already and was trying it on to see how it sat with the rest of her day. She had the sort of face you see on quays in bad weather and the sort of hands that had done enough cut, lift, carry to be useful in an argument with wood. He noticed the small crescent of flour by her knuckle and thought for a moment that he had invented it in a fit of narrative, but it was real and she rubbed at it with her thumb while she spoke. She said that she had seen the spoon in the pawn shop and had recognised the notch because her gran had had a spoon with a notch like it and had smacked her with it for trying to steal dried apricots. She laughed a little and then did not laugh because it is hard to introduce grief to strangers without feeling you have broken a rule. She told him she had got his number from Rowan in a moment of bolshy optimism and had sent the messages without asking because she had the sort of temperament that assumed permission would be granted if you got to asking in time. He said that he had minded and not minded in a way that was more about himself than about her. She told him to mind everything or he’d never know when to stop, and then she passed him a paper cup of water and instructed him to drink it with a gentleness that made his chest warm in a place that didn’t have a proper name.

The table set for Heat One looked like the way a person draws a feast when they are small: repeated, generous, neat. Jugs of water stood between plates like chaperones whose minds were mostly open, and the pies arrived with a solemnity that felt religious and silly at once. They were anonymous in exactly the way Mrs Clegg had promised they would be, stamped only with numbers in a hand that had very clearly been told to behave. Tom watched Trevor take his seat three chairs down and spread his arms as if there were wings under his jacket and he intended to show them later if the lights were adequate. The boy Fin had found a place up by the doorway with a volunteer badge that gave him the right to look important, and he was using that right with the full force of eighteen.

Mrs Clegg did the preamble because that was her job and because nobody else could have made the words charity and pie sit in a sentence with dignity. She laid down rules with the sort of affection that makes rules bearable and included a reminder about licking one’s own spoon in a tone that made every man in the front row check his manners for dust and pretend he’d known them all along. Maureen lifted a hand when it was time and the room’s noise shifted from river to tap. Izzy mouthed something at Tom that looked like breathe and watch your corners, and Ramesh did an impression of a conductor that was undercut by the mints in his palm.

It began with a clap and the soft scrape of knives and forks against crockery. Tom turned the first pie with his knife and tasted the heat at its neck, and years of kitchens and market corners and casual dinners in cold rooms told him how far he could go without scalding his mouth into idiocy. The pastry was short and had been handled by someone who believed in kindness; the filling was beef and carrot and something with pepper that had been allowed to tell its story without being shouted down. He took measured bites because he had trained himself out of the human impulse to rush when eyes are upon you and because his grandmother’s kitchen had taught him to leave room for taste even when time suggested otherwise. He thought of shells and how they lift steam if you open them the way you talk to shy animals. He worked the spoon under the crust and let the heat whisper out before it could burn, and the spoon found its notch in his hand and told his wrist what to do. It was profoundly ridiculous that grief and muscle memory could stand in a hall and make a strategy out of pastry, but ridiculousness had been the point all along.

Trevor, on the other hand, approached the event as if the pies had personally insulted him. He attacked rather than ate, which made the audience do that noise crowds do when they are watching something that might be spectacular or a cautionary tale. There were men in the back who would have bet on the rate his jaw could do a thing if they’d been allowed to take notes. He glanced sideways often enough to make a person think he was counting lives rather than watching plates. He finished his first and raised his chin without raising his hand, which made Mrs Clegg tut loud enough to be considered an adjudication. Two chairs down from Tom, a man with a sweet face and a T-shirt with a cartoon cat that was enjoying chaos took one drink too many of water and went a colour nobody wanted to be; he sat back when Mrs Clegg’s assistant tapped his shoulder and nodded in a way that said he had remembered he was not immortal and that charity would not be helped by him forgetting again.

The second pie on Tom’s plate had a bitterness on the edge that did not belong. It was not the good bitter of stout or the satisfying sharp of onion that has told the truth; it was the sort of bitter that suggests a hand has been heavy in the wrong place or a heart has been too light near a spice rack. He looked up and saw Maureen looking at him as if she had been watching for precisely that expression. He took a breath that owed a debt to his grandmother and he moved his spoon to the seam between pastry and filling and he left the slop where the flavour had gone wrong and stole the better pieces the way a thief steals with noble intentions. He drank when he knew he had to and he did not when the voice in his ear that is his own voice told him to be theatrical. He finished his second while Trevor threw a look that made men step out of fists and into sighs.

He did not win outright and he did not want to. Winning is a taste that, once acquired, makes you put salt on everything and pretend your tongue is honest. He came second to a woman named Farah whose smile belonged in a museum and who patted his arm as if to say that he had been brought up properly. Trevor came third with a performative surprise that fooled nobody old enough to own a radio. Mrs Clegg read out the names who would return for the semi-final with a formality that made them into something they were not and everyone behaved as if they had just been knighted. Tom looked for Izzy and found her doing the kind of clap that makes people near a stairwell glance for the echo. He found Ramesh, who pressed a mint into his palm and told him without saying it that flying and pies had one thing in common and it was not speed.

After the noise had turned shaggy again and the chairs had remembered they were only chairs, Maureen cornered him with the sort of experience that lets you corner without having to perform the corral. She told him that the second pie had had a whisper of something that didn’t belong and that the whisper had been deliberate, and she also told him that he had behaved like a person who knew better than to make a fuss. He wanted to ask her who and why but long practice in small towns tells you that the answers are never given in one breath and are never given before somebody has made tea.

Caro waited until Izzy had done congratulations and Ramesh had told him a story about a cousin’s cousin who had once won a mango-eating contest in Goa and had been miserable for two weeks. She handed him a paper packet with a piece of tart inside that made the air smell of apples and restraint, and he ate a bite and felt his mouth forgive him. She said that she had seen a man at the kitchen door earlier whose jacket thought it was expensive and whose eyes thought everything belonged to him until proven otherwise, and she had told a volunteer to tell Mrs Clegg and Mrs Clegg had moved a chair in front of the door and the man had decided he had urgent business somewhere that did not have rules. She said she had seen the same man at the pawn shop and that he had bought a watch and a lie, and she folded her arms like a person who could be persuaded to wrestle if the people of the town voted on it first.

Rowan materialised the way she did when she had done three things at once and enjoyed only one of them; she looked pleased in a private way and told him that Fitch had been persuaded by Auntie Mags and the landlord of the Copper Pigeon, acting together like unlikely saints, to apologise to a chair and a bar mat and then to hand over three items which did not include the spoon because Caro had already snatched it out of the air like a keeper making a save. She told him that if he was going to keep putting talismans in pockets he should attach bells to them like cats, and that he should not, under any circumstances, accept a drink from a man whose coat had different opinions to his shoes. He promised to accept drinks only from people who would tell Izzy later, and Izzy, who had come up behind without asking the floor’s permission, said that she would be making a list.

The day went long in the way days go long when they have to fit more than they promised to. Tom sat through two more heats in the manner of a person who is not watching so much as taking notes on where people’s eyes go when they are not eating. He saw three strategies repeated and one invented; he saw a teenager with cheeks like apples pace himself into a place in the semi-final and then cry into his mother’s cardigan as if relief were a liquid. He saw Trevor flirt with a camera and the camera flirt back because optics have no shame. He watched Maureen fold her scarf the way a person she loved had once folded a flag, and he felt, just for a second, as if the town might be a caravan and today the caravan had decided not to move.

On the walk home the pier lights did their neat trick of pretending to be a string of statements rather than bulbs. The wind shoved him around like a friend too honest for indoors. He looked into the dark where the sea was busy and let the noise wash the salt off the parts of him that had taken a battering from being observed. His phone buzzed once and then twice, and he thought about ignoring it, and then he thought about being a person who did not ignore messages from people who had returned his life to him in brown paper. The first was from Izzy and it was a photograph of him with his mouth doing a thing he hoped nobody had seen; the caption said heroism is a pie that you eat one bite at a time. The second was from Caro and it said only that there was a man in a tweed-pretending jacket at the far end of the pier again and that she would like him very much not to be there and could he, if he happened to be passing, keep passing.

He put his hands in his pockets because he had always done that when he needed to think. His fingers found the spoon and pressed into the notch like a pilgrim touching stone. He turned toward home and felt eyes on his back that were probably only weather. He told the town out loud to behave its better self and smiled immediately at the absurdity, and then he did the other sensible thing you do in a place like this. He messaged Rowan and told her not to worry but to tell Auntie Mags that there was a jacket that needed a word. The gull that believed in civic duty took one last arc and took itself off to bed, and the night settled on its haunches like a dog that had learned at last, by patient practice, to sit.The morning after the first heat pretended to be ordinary for as long as it could. Tom made himself be fooled by it. He shaved without nicking himself, told Maud to be brave, and read the forecast with the squint of a man who trusted numbers but not the tone they took when printed in tiny font. The town was washing its face; vans snorted behind bakeries; a woman on a bicycle rang her bell at a pigeon with the etiquette of a duchess speaking to a cousin at the tennis. He tried to persuade himself that the message from Caro had been simply a neighbour’s nudge and not a summons, and he did very well at that until he reached the promenade and saw the shape of a man leaning on the rail in the exact spot where boys liked to drop chips to test the moral nature of gulls.

He did not alter speed because altering speed is a form of confession. He kept his hands in his pockets and the rhythm of his walk in the firm line of a man with somewhere to be. The jacket looked like the sort you bought to give your mother the impression you had a plan; it had an aspiration to heritage that the stitching could not quite back up. The man wearing it had shoulders that made decisions independent of any brain and a profile that would forget a promise if something shone in the corner of its eye. He looked out to sea with the forced contemplation of a person trying hard to look as if they belonged to nobody. Tom’s impulse to stop and say something, anything, was almost physical, like a sneeze you have promised yourself you will not have in church. He overruled it. He let the wind make the only conversation and walked on until he could circle back through the town like a man who had remembered the milk.

Rowan opened the Errand Boy door with the briskness of someone who had been awake twelve minutes longer than the rest of the world. She had a pencil behind one ear and the expression of a person whose day had already included both triumph and irritation. When he told her the jacket had returned to its favourite view of the elements, she did not sigh because she had respect for the limits of sighs. She texted Auntie Mags a single word—“Tweedish?”—and got back a message that read “Seen. Choir on it.” He had been in this town all his life and every time he thought he knew the shapes the town could take it found another one. Imagining Maureen’s tenors and altos marshalling themselves at the end of the pier was a species of joy he had not known he needed.

The day’s flying did not argue with him. There is a relief in doing the thing you are built to do even if the world has decided to audition you for a second act. The prop wash sang the known hymn; the controls obeyed the choreography; Ramesh offered him one of those dry nuts that taste of nothing and are peculiarly comforting on days when your body might otherwise consider rebellion. “You were good,” Ramesh said on the descent into Southampton, making it sound like an observation about weather forecasts rather than praise. “Your timing is getting as fussy as mine and I consider that an inheritance gracefully received.”

“It’s the pies,” Tom said. “They’ve turned my brain into a metronome.”

“Do not blame pastry for your growth. That is how villains are made. Also, my cousin texted to say the aunties have taken up positions around the pier like an ancient order of guardian birds. She used the word ‘formation’ as if she were describing swans.”

“Rowan says the choir’s on it.”

“Then we are saved,” Ramesh said, and tapped the altimeter like a man reminding himself that instruments have souls.

On lunch, which he ate at an hour that confused lettuce, he walked down to a strip of shops that had decided they were a village inside a town and stopped at a door he might have missed if his day had not begun with messages from a stranger who had returned a spoon. The sign was hand-lettered and, like all good hand-lettered signs, made you think a person with wrists and patience had meant the letters and not only drawn them. It said Caro, with smaller words that changed because chalk likes moods. Today it declared bread, pies, repairs to your armour if needed. The place was barely bigger than Maud; there were two shelves of loaves that looked like they had opinions about poetry, a counter bearing half a dozen tarts, a pint jug with flowers that might have been weeds until they were invited in, and a table with two chairs that had been painted too many times and were proud of it. Caro herself was behind the counter with flour on the side of her hand and a frown that vanished the moment she looked up, not because she had decided to cover it but because some faces know benevolence as a default.

“You came,” she said, as if they had agreed to something more particular than curiosity. “You look like you haven’t been fed properly. That’s not a criticism. That’s a note from the universe.”

“The universe is bossy today,” he said, and let himself smile.

“It has been consulted by women who sing in three parts,” she said, and slid a plate across to him with a wedge of something that had apples and a quiet to it. “The jacket went away after being sung at from two sides by sopranos of conviction. Fin was there and tried to take a photograph; he was told if he made men into souvenirs he would lose the use of his elbows.”

“He’d survive that,” Tom said. “He’d just invent a life where he didn’t need elbows.”

“He will, and it will make a mess. Sit. Please. I won’t let you leave with your blood made entirely of airport coffee. I feel responsible for your blood at least until your heat is over.”

He sat because saying no would have been a lecture to gravity. The tart was the kind of tart that made a case for restraint being a louder note than richness. It had the pier in it somehow; it had the memory of chill and the promise of sun. She watched him not like a restaurateur stalking reviews but like a person checking a plant has had water. There were photographs pegged to a string along the wall: a woman who had Caro’s cheekbones holding a small girl who was making the kind of face babies make when they find out their fists belong to them; a man with a boat behind him and the sort of beard that is a weather report; a picture of an oven with a caption that read she will not win but she will sing. When he had eaten two thirds of the wedge and convinced himself he had taste because he had left a third on the plate, she poured tea that would not have shamed his grandmother’s tongue.

“You sent me a pie,” he said, because he had not thanked her and it is a poor habit to let gratitude go stale. “And a message.”

“I am bad at leaving well enough alone,” she said. “I see something and then I have to go knock on it to see if it’s hollow.” She was cutting pastry with a knife so sharp it had no interest in his opinion, and she handled it the way you handle a thing that you intend to become a friend. “My gran had a spoon with a notch and she swore that spoons learned hands and stayed loyal. I don’t believe in many inheritable traits beyond cheekbones and the urge to swear at radios, but I believe in that.”

“You got it back,” he said. His hand went to the pocket again, because some habits are as involuntary as gooseflesh. “Thank you feels odd in my mouth when it’s for something larger than the word, but thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” she said. “I am in debt to this town for other things. They keep giving me back to myself and the least I can do is go get spoons out of pawn shops. I will accept payment in the form of not poisoning yourself with other people’s nonsense and not being a martyr for the sake of a ribbon.”

“I came second,” he said, and immediately wondered why he had. “I don’t know why I’m telling you like it’s confession.”

“Because you want me to know you’re not greedy,” she said, smiling without softness. “I already know. I’ve seen greedy men. They are boring in very loud ways. You are not boring. You might be foolish. That is forgivable.”

He stayed until a woman came in needing a loaf for a husband who was difficult about crusts, and Caro told him to go be diligent somewhere else. On his way out he bought a small pie he did not need because it is a good idea to pay where you have sat down your heartbeat for a minute.

The week unfurled like string across corners. There was a staff briefing in which a manager from head office appeared on a screen like a slightly disappointed aunt and told them about a new protocol for something none of them believed happened, and Izzy made notes just to keep her hands from making headlines. There was rain that tried on identities and decided to be mist for most of Thursday, making the runway a suggestion rather than a statement. There was a call from his mother to ask whether the cat had forgiven her for changing her food (the cat had not; the cat had citations) and whether he might come for Sunday if he wasn’t too busy with “the thing.” He said yes because there are weeks when yes is the only honest answer you can give your mother.

There was also, threaded through the week, the feeling of being watched that did not, for once, belong to planes or tourists. He caught sight of the jacket twice from the bus, once outside a betting shop and once on the pavement near the back entrance to St Stephen’s where volunteers had started to carry in boxes marked with permanent marker that had been used so many times the handwriting had evolved. He did what he was meant to do with feeling watched; he told Rowan. Rowan told Auntie Mags. Auntie Mags told a woman in her pilates class who happened to be married to the postman who had a brother who painted the lines down the centre of roads for a living and had opinions about the way men in odd coats stood when they meant harm. A small fleet of uncles adopted corners and polished looks, and Tom remembered the advice fishermen had given him when he was seven: if you have to learn to throw a punch, don’t, because you live in a place where men with their sleeves rolled up will do it for you if it is necessary. He trusted that and he trusted the choir.

On Friday night the Copper Pigeon hosted a quiz and Izzy insisted that they go as a team of four with Rowan and Fin. Fin turned up with hair that had been told to behave and refused, and with a notebook full of diagrams for a bicycle that could make toast as it went. Tom had the peculiar experience of watching Fin be clever; it is a shock the first time you witness someone half your age pull history out of the air like linen. Rowan frowned at the picture round as if the photographs had failed to live up to their side of a contract. Izzy messed up the sports question on purpose to make the men at the table next to them relax into their stereotypes, and then she embarrassed them with a run on literature that made the landlord laugh into his sleeve. On the way home Fin took several steps backwards to keep telling a story and nearly fell off the kerb, and Rowan pulled him back by the back of his collar the way you do with people you love who have not quite learned where pavements end. Tom slept well that night because his brain had been permitted to believe in easy answers for ninety minutes.

When he went to his mother’s on Sunday, the house smelled as if the carpets had opinions. She had put out the good china because the good china had sulked, and she made him go outside to look at the raspberry canes as if raspberries were a matter for national concern. They were, in a way; small red truths his grandmother had trained with one finger. He told her about the spoon and she made a face to suggest that of course the spoon had gone walkabout because spoons were rogues and would be, and of course it had returned because even rogues missed home. As they ate roast chicken that had crispness on the outside you only get from a lifetime of camouflage with salt, she told him again the story of the first time his grandmother had smacked his hand for sticking it into a bowl of sugar and he pretended not to remember just to hear his mother tell it the way she liked to tell it. After lunch she sent him up to the small bedroom where there were two boxes marked Maeve, and he sat cross-legged on the carpet and opened them as if he were unwrapping a season. There were recipe cuttings with edges that had been chewed by decades and patience, a notebook filled with lists of who had brought what to which funeral and which wake had the best ham, a church newsletter from 1978 with a photograph of a fete where a man he recognised only as young was learning how to carry a cake as if it were currency. There was also a photograph of Maeve with Maureen in hats that could have been used to shade small villages, standing shoulder to shoulder like twin varieties of weather. He tucked that into his jacket to show Maureen later because it is good to hand people proof of their own long selves.

The semi-final draw took place on a Wednesday in a back room at the library that smelt of glue and good intentions. Mrs Clegg had made a cake that nobody was allowed to name because the naming would give it a curse and the library had had enough curses for one budget cycle. Maureen had her scarf arranged in a manner that made three teenagers whisper “pirate” and then look afraid of their own courage. Trevor leaned on a shelf in the crime section and managed to look as if all the books were about him and none of them could say it out loud because libel laws are a minefield. Tom drew a card that said Heat Two and tried to imagine, immediately, what that meant about digestion, energy, temperature, destiny, and other things that would mock him behind their hands if he gave them too much importance. Farah drew Heat One, which pleased him because her smile was sympathetic and made the air more breathable for everyone.

There were more rules because semi-finals required them. There would be water on the tables and it would be water from the tap in the side kitchen because that tap had been used to make squash for decades and had learned discretion. There would be a nurse on hand who would not sigh but would convey the idea of sighing with her eyebrows. There would be a man filming, because the town had accepted that it now lived in a time when events did not exist unless captured, and the man would be kept away from certain angles by two ushers whose arms were persuasive. Mrs Clegg added, almost as an afterthought, that if anybody’s water seemed odd, they were permitted to raise their hand and request a jug from her, personally. The way she said the word odd turned it into a species whose habits she had studied.

After the meeting, when people were leaving in clumps that would become conversations on social media before they had become conversations at home, Maureen cornered him in a way that did not require walls. He handed her the photograph from his mother’s box and watched weather cross her face: sun first, then a small bright rain she would deny, then wind to shake it clear. She told him that his grandmother had once stopped a fight in the churchyard with a ladle and a remark about grief being a poor excuse for blood. He told her he had never seen anyone wield a ladle with that much aim. She looked over his shoulder and narrowed her eyes as if the horizon had been misbehaving. “Watch Trevor,” she said, not softly. “Not because he is clever. Because he keeps company with men who are.”

Auntie Mags came into the Errand Boy like a weather front on Friday, told Rowan that the jacket’s name was not Fitch after all but Fiske—“which is the kind of name a man chooses when he is tired of what he started with”—and that Fiske was the sort of person who took ten-pound notes like aspirin. Fiske had a friend from Poole with a buzz cut and the sort of laugh that makes old dogs leave the room, and the friend had been seen in the vicinity of St Stephen’s on Thursday morning talking to a volunteer in a way that made the volunteer find a reason to be somewhere else. The volunteer’s name was Jill; she had elbows that had broken up two fights in a Girl Guides canteen in 1999, and she had told Fiske that if he wanted to find the toilets he should follow the signs like everyone else. Fiske had laughed in a way that suggested he thought himself a charming exception to rules as old as water. Jill had fetched a ladder and put it in his way on the grounds that the world sometimes requires symbolic gestures as much as physical barriers.

Rowan told Tom all of this in the car park behind the leisure centre where there is always one seagull pretending it lives elsewhere. She was chewing a piece of mint with the grave air of a person who disapproved of the leaf but understood its contribution. “Do not make yourself into bait,” she said, pointing at him with a biro as if she could inscribe sense on his shirt. “Do not make yourself into a problem. If you see a jug of water and it smells like the back room of a nightclub, do not drink it to spite whoever hoped you would. If you feel your heart do anything other than heart things, stop. If you see a man in a jacket who looks like he is going to say your name as if he invented it, walk away.”

“That last one is general life advice,” he said.

“That last one is the only thing I want on my grave,” she said. “That and ‘she returned her library books on time’.”

Semi-final Saturday came in white and blue like a postcard that had decided to be truthful. The hall was warmer for the number of bodies in it and cooler for the number of nerves. The volunteers were in high spirits—everyone is when events move from hypothetical to happening—and there was a woman from the paper with hair that wanted to be taken seriously taking notes as if she could capture the smell of pastry with shorthand. Fin had a proper lanyard and an expression that said he had been entrusted with a small rocket and was not yet sure what it did. He had a bruise on his shin that he claimed was from a shelving unit and which Rowan claimed was from arrogance.

Tom’s spoon sat in his pocket where it could comment gently on his choices. Izzy was there with a clipboard that had three clips as if two would not be sufficient to tether administration, and she had, very delicately, brushed his lapel with her fingers as if to take off a speck of nothing. Ramesh turned up late with the excuse that he had been waylaid by a cousin who had a complaint about school dinners and the aubergine, and he brought with him a sense of perspective that he pretended not to own.

Heat One went in like an arrow with a ribbon tied to it. Farah ate with the sort of focus that made people sit back and admire attention as if it were a craft. A man in a rugby shirt forgot that swallowing is a hobby but recovered before anyone had to pat him. A volunteer reached for a jug and then thought better of it and did the inspection of water you do when someone has put ideas in your head about water. When they finished and clapped and the clapping turned into talk, Mrs Clegg moved the jugs herself with a bureaucracy’s tender caution. “Don’t fuss,” she told a woman who had proffered assistance. “If I fuss, it is a pre-approved fuss. Yours is not licensed.”

Tom took his place when called, and the room made that hush that is not silence but the polite version of it. He looked down at the plate and thought about steam and honesty and the part of himself that wanted this not for the ribbon but because people keep a space inside them where a made thing can sit and be loved. He looked along the line and saw Trevor three chairs away with his jaw set as if he were about to argue with a tax inspector. He saw a teenager with hair like a haystack radiate nerves that made his fork sweat. He saw a woman whose T-shirt said run like you stole it and an older man whose hands made slow fists on the table as if he were negotiating with them to be wise.

Mrs Clegg did the little speech she always did, about how this was silly and serious in equal measure, and how anybody who made themselves unwell would be personally visited by a schoolteacher from 1972, and how if the pies tasted of something that was not pie they were to lift their hand and allow the universe to reorganise itself. Maureen stood as if she were the person the universe consulted about these things. Tom took a breath and let it out as if it were a piece of string he was laying down for later.

When he lifted his fork to the first pie the smell was good and the heat was right, and he trusted his tongue to be grown up. He felt the interest of the room without making it into a wind. He did what he had been practising, which was to move without haste and also without the kind of thought that narrates itself into panic. The pastry yielded like manners. The filling was chicken and leek with a pepper that did not shout. He took a drink of water and then, because Rowan’s instruction had lodged itself the way some instructions do, he put the glass down and sniffed the next mouthful not with his nose but with the part of his brain that had learned to recognise runway glare and the sort of smoke that was only a toaster and the sort of smoke that meant leave. The water smelt like water that had been out of a tap for three minutes and had decided it did not need to be dramatic. He drank it and watched the men at the end of the row do the same.

He turned to his second plate and saw, in the reflected curve of the cutlery, a movement three rows back—nothing more than a shoulder and a knowing tilt of a head—and for the first time since he had started this ridiculous, blessed thing the noise in the hall lost shape around him. He looked up and found Caro’s face and fixed himself to it the way you fix to a star when land and sea forget their arrangement. She raised her chin by a fraction the way a person nods to a horse when it is time to ask it to behave, and he asked himself to behave. He cut into the second pie and the scent that came up was so sharp it would have done for furniture polish. He put down his fork as Mrs Clegg had instructed him; he lifted his hand. He did not make it a drama; he simply existed in the matter-of-fact way of a man who has learned to say “unable” on the radio and mean it without apology.

The room did not gasp because the room had been trained not to reward theatre. Mrs Clegg came, took the plate, raised an eyebrow at Maureen, and swapped it for another as if this were a game of patience and she had rearranged the cards for the pleasure of showing that the deck could be made to obey. Trevor, who had been watching the side of the room as much as he had been watching his own chewing, made a face that suggested disappointment without any of the grace of it. The teenager two places down did the same as Tom had done, shyly, almost at the elbow, which is how bravery sometimes appears when it thinks nobody will clap for it, and it made the older man smile as if his hands had been told they could rest.

Tom ate his replacement pie with his head clear and his mouth grateful. When he finished and sat back with the relief of a man who has made an appointment with common sense and kept it, he heard movement by the side door and the sort of polite kerfuffle you get when rules have done what they were meant to do and men have been given a choice between looking foolish and leaving. He did not look round because he had other things to be and because the look would have been a gift to a person who did not deserve it. He let his heart go back to hearting. He let the spoon’s weight be just weight. He let himself imagine for one second his grandmother’s laugh arriving like a pan lid being put down on a table with a thump.

When the heat was over and the clapping had done what clapping does to make breathing easy again, he did not immediately seek out the answer as to who had tried to put a mean taste in his mouth. He let the town do that because the town enjoys nothing more than getting the taste out on behalf of someone it has claimed. He stood by the jug table and found himself shoulder to shoulder with Maureen, who stared at the ceiling tiles like they could be persuaded to develop a sense of narrative. “You remembered to raise your hand,” she said, without looking at him.

“I am trainable,” he said.

“You are stubborn enough to learn. It will save you from more than one thing.” She made a tch noise with her tongue. “The man with the jacket left. He will not come back today. He has been told.” Her mouth did a shape that made mischief look like a cousin of justice. “Do you need to know whether it was him?”

“I don’t know what I need,” he said, which was the truth. “I want to be faithful to the silliness of this. I want to be ridiculous and charitable in equal measure and not get turned into a story about how men are awful.”

“Everything is always also a story about how men are awful,” Maureen said. “We merely attempt to give the other stories space to breathe.” She touched his elbow with one finger. “We’ve arranged a small annoyance for Mr Latchford. Nothing illegal. Merely corrective.”

He found Rowan with Fin and Izzy by the doors where the draft makes programmes flap. Fin had his lanyard wound three times round his hand in a way that a boy winds a string to keep the kite from escaping and was vibrating with the aftershocks of responsibility. “You were good,” he told Tom bluntly, as if good were a currency he was authorized to distribute. “You did the hand thing at the right time. The water is boring.”

“Boring water is the aim,” Rowan said. “Interesting water is for swimming and whisky.” She flicked her eyes towards the side of the hall and he followed the look and saw two of Auntie Mags’s choir brothers politely escorting a man with a tweedy idea of himself through the door. The man wore an expression that said he had been personally wronged by physics. “He’ll get bored of being looked at by women old enough to have invented him,” Rowan said. “He’ll stop being a problem because he will realise he is not a story here.”

Caro arrived with a tray held like an offering and the sort of smile that happens when fear has been asked to leave. She had three small pies that she pressed upon him and the teenager and the older man as if to reassure their mouths that they were observed. “Taste,” she said, with authority. “It’s the only way to remind yourself what you’re for.” He ate a piece of something with fennel so delicately used that it made him want to sit down and write a note to his own palate apologising for years of bluntness.

It was only as the afternoon thinned into the sort of low gold light that makes chairs become sentimental objects that he realised the place on his breastbone that had been clenched all week had let go. He breathed without counting the breath. He watched the last heat go through its comedy and its care. He saw Trevor do just enough of what he does to remain a problem for later. He watched Maureen’s scarf redeclare flame and the choir move, as one, to stack chairs. He let the town be what it was in front of him; old and daft, opportunistic and loyal, County and Market wearing the same coat.

On the walk back along the prom, which had decided to remember its manners and not spit, he felt the sudden emptiness that comes when an event ends and the space it took up in your head closes, leaving only the echo. He did not want to go home yet because home would hold Maud and the map and kindness, and he had the unworthy luck of too much kindness to spend in one day. He turned instead into the narrow run of side streets that had been made before anyone thought about cars, where you have to flatten yourself against a wall to let someone else pass and you always, always look up and see laundry above your head like flags of truce. A boy on a scooter played a game with his balance and the kerb and won. A man smoking out of a window pretended to be uninterested in the affairs below and was the opposite.

His phone buzzed when he did not expect it and he considered not looking and looked. It was his mother, of course, with a photograph of a handwritten note in his grandmother’s hand, which had surfaced from nowhere as handwriting does when it has decided you need a reminder you have not ordered. It said, unceremoniously: “Do not cry into the flour. It makes paste you cannot bake.” He laughed aloud, stopped dead to do it, and the man at the window grinned and lifted his cigarette in salute because joy is a language older than neighbourhoods.

At home he took the spoon out and put it on the shelf where it could look at him. He made himself a very plain plate of food because glory is not helped by spice at night. He sat with the radio on low and let a woman with a voice like a shawl talk about shipping lanes and wind directions. He answered a message from Caro with a photograph of Maud, which he knew was an eccentric thing to do and did anyway because somebody should appreciate Maud’s dignity. He wrote to Ramesh a single line: got through; you were right about boring water, and got back an emoji of a mint and a plane that looked like a bird if you squinted. He lay down thinking of the way steam lifts when you get the angle right, how small things capitulate to patience, how the sky can be trusted to be itself and not yours.

At some point, between the shipping and the music, the town rearranged itself to sleep. The gulls tucked their arguments in for later. The pier lights remembered their quiet version. The man in the jacket was nowhere you could point to and the space where he had been was taken up by dogs on leads and prams and a man running very slowly carrying what might have been a large baguette wrapped in yesterday’s news. In the morning, people would open windows and let air in and gossip out. In the morning, he would do the checks and the call-outs and the part of himself that belongs to the machine would hum in time. In the morning, the festival would step one notch closer to its best and worst selves and he would, again, put his hand in his pocket and touch a piece of wood that had learned his shape and kept learning it like an old song.Chapter 6

The town acted like it had not been gossiping about him since breakfast. It presented him with ordinary pavements and the same cracked paint on the bench by the bus stop, and even the gulls tried, for a full ten seconds, to pretend they were birds and not local councillors with wings. Tom took the lie and walked in it until his phone informed him that Bournemouth Today had put up a photograph in which he was incontrovertibly eating and called it “Pilot Raises Hand.” The headline had the air of a moral, which amused him more than it should have. Izzy forwarded it with no commentary beyond a small sticker that read boring water in bubble letters, and he laughed in his kitchen like a man who has been permitted to see himself as ridiculous and therefore forgivable.

At work, Ramesh tapped the article with a forefinger as if it might bruise. He said that if Tom made a habit of raising his hand at appropriate moments he might one day qualify for sainthood in two parishes and a flight school, and then he looked out of the crew room window and declared a crosswind on the descent into Guernsey that would sort the saints from the merely pious. Tom did his checks as if the paper did not exist and as if the world would be kind to him if he were kind to his instruments, which is the sort of bargain men make with machines when they are unwilling to admit superstition. On approach, the runway slid under them at an angle that would have caused civilians to develop opinions, and he found himself loving the exactness of it in the way a man loves crossword clues when he’s allowed to be clever without having to be charming. “Unable,” he said to the part of himself that wanted to be dramatic, and he moved his hands the small distance that separates competence from luck. When tyres kissed tarmac with the private language they use for peace, Ramesh nodded like a man whose cousin has done well and he is not going to embarrass anyone by making a speech.

News travelled along bakery queues and into taxis. By the time he finished the afternoon rotation, a woman in a tabard at the supermarket had congratulated him on his wrist and three boys had done a mock-solemn salute at the bus stop as if he were a lifeguard their mothers insisted they respect. Fin turned up at Errand Boy with a roll of stickers that said BORING WATER in caps and a grin that could have powered small appliances, and Rowan made him promise solemnly to ask Mrs Clegg before he affixed them to anything with plumbing. She also made a list of hall doors that had been behaving like suggestions and passed it to Auntie Mags, who passed it to two ushers, who passed it to a man named Barry who had the kind of gentle patience that makes doors behave out of shame.

Caro’s queue was longer than it had a right to be for a shop that had only two chairs and a jug of flowers no one could name, but queues are how small towns pay compliments, and Tom stood in it without feeling special. When he reached the counter she already had a paper bag in her hand and the look of a person who had foreseen his need and was not going to allow him to varnish it with disclaimers. The bag contained a pie the size of his palm and a wedge of something that blushed with rhubarb as if it had been caught being affectionate. She informed him that Fin had tried to pay for his pasties with a drawing of a bicycle that made toast and she had refused on the grounds that her oven was not ready to consider new colleagues, and then she told him quietly that a fisherman from Mudeford had been in, and she had claimed a promise from Tom’s afternoon.

“Proper oysters,” she said, with the seriousness of a chemist. “Not a jar making lofty claims. Your gran’s note made me jealous. The air will do what it wants, but the sea—if you ask properly—will share.”

They went at a time of day when the light considers changing its mind, and they arrived at a quay that looked like a child’s drawing: flat water, two boats with faces, a man in a hat that had lived two lives already. Bill, who had a nose with maps on it and hands that had mended rope more than once, showed Tom the crate as if he were introducing him to nephews. The shells were not pretty in the way catalogues tell you things should be pretty; they were cottages for small saints, rough and convincing, and when he lifted one he felt its patience. Caro watched his hands the way a person watches someone else read a book they love. She said that her gran had called oysters honest food because you can tell when they are wrong, and she did not add anything about men because sometimes it is polite not to make the obvious parallel when a friend is behaving like a gentleman.

Bill asked for nothing except exact change and a promise that Tom would not let the town call the sea a view when it is a working thing, and Tom gave both without negotiating because you do not haggle with maps or men with rope on their palms. On the drive back, Caro talked about repair with the kind of affection other people reserve for the first strawberry of June. She had a corner of the shop where broken tins and old pans waited like dogs for their owners to come back to their senses, and she said that everything worth keeping has a hinge somewhere, and if you find it and oil it, you can persuade the thing to be itself again. He nearly told her something about planes and hinges and the way a correctly adjusted rudder feels like a moral decision, but he stopped because metaphors are like good knives and you do not wave them about in front of people you are still getting to know.

The final was a week away and the town dealt with this truth by pretending to be busier than it was. People who had not set foot in St Stephen’s since Julie Andrews had conducted a singalong pretended they had volunteer shifts and wore lanyards like medals for a campaign that had not yet begun. The library displayed a photograph of past winners and politely asked that nobody draw moustaches on anyone without checking first, and the woman at the dry cleaner put a sign in the window that read We do mustard, wine, and glory. Trevor posted a video of himself on the Internet doing something that looked like training and might have been chewing, and Carstairs, who sold combs and had somehow wound himself into the legend of the market like a knot you forget why you tied, used the window of his stall to display a poster that asked the town to vote for “Standards” without naming the candidate. Maureen arrived at the radio station with a tin of biscuits and told the presenter, in exactly the voice you use when you are letting someone feel clever on their own programme, that the festival was not about winning or men with jaws, and that anyone who poisoned a jug would have to deal with a small army of women who did not believe in pity as a first line of defence.

Training without becoming comic is like walking uphill without letting your face acknowledge gravity. Tom did it anyway, in his kitchen with the radio low enough to suggest it might be sleeping. He practised the boring things: cutting steam without losing heat, leaving bad bits without telling his eyes to panic, drinking water like a person who has been to more than one party with unlabelled punch. Izzy sat on his counter and threw complicating thoughts at him because love, in their form, meant helpful sabotage. “If Trevor apologised to you, would you forgive him,” she asked, and he nearly choked on a piece of crust and said yes the way men say yes when they mean no but are embarrassed to make it sound like revenge. She told him that good boys need to stop thinking they can rehabilitate every arsehole who offers them a handshake, and he told her that good girls need to stop confusing honesty with cruelty, and then they both smiled because they had been playing their parts since twelve and it still did not bore them.

Rowan built a rota that would have made a small airport proud. She divided the hall into quadrants and assigned to each quadrant a person with a nose and no interest in being popular. She called the list the Boring Water Brigade and Fin insisted on laminating it because lamination gives even nonsense the dignity of planning. When she took it to Mrs Clegg, Mrs Clegg considered it, scratched out a few names with the flair of an editor, and said that if there was even a whisper of subterfuge the offending person would be invited to hold a church door open for the entire next service and be publicly told thank you every sixth person, which was, in its way, a sentence.

The jacket, having discovered that attention is not the same as power, thinned out around the edges like a man in a coat in a hot room. People saw him and remembered something they had been meaning to do elsewhere. A girl at the newsagent told him loudly to pick up a pen and fill in a change-of-address form for his conscience, and he left with a magazine about boats he did not read. He turned up outside Caro’s at closing time once and stood as if the pavement owed him a favour, and Caro simply brought two chairs out onto the pavement and sat in one with a book and invited Tom to sit in the other with a newspaper, and the waiting changed size until it could not be contained by a single man and went somewhere with more room. After half an hour, a choir alto passed and offered the man a throat lozenge with the absent-minded kindness of a woman who has trained herself to weaponise civility, and he took it because gift-horses embarrass ponies like him. He wandered away while Caro and Tom continued to read in companionable silence that was, to people passing, a good advert for living in a place where two chairs can constitute policy.

Work kept being work, which is a thing to be grateful for. There were checklists and the slow kindness of the morning shift and a conversation on the tarmac with a mechanic about a squeak that had opinions. There was a diversion to Exeter when a flock of birds decided that Alderney’s runway would make an adequate agora for their arguments, and there was the small, smug joy of a coffee in an airport that belonged to someone else, which felt like misbehaving while still being paid. Ramesh told stories about an uncle in Leicester who swore blind that you could tell the character of a man by how he folded a tea towel, and Tom told him that Bournemouth had a woman who would put you in the metaphorical stocks for looking at a jug disrespectfully, and Ramesh said that English civil society was both a marvel and a threat to human dignity. Izzy wrote him a note on an airline napkin that said stop being noble at inanimate objects and tucked it into the pocket with the spoon when he wasn’t looking.

On Wednesday, his mother texted him a photograph of a biscuit tin that had been living at the back of the airing cupboard since the last council had been composed entirely of men with moustaches. Inside there were Christmas cards from years with two in front, and a folded note in Maeve’s hand that read, in that bossy slope he knew, Oyster pie is for cold days and warm people. If there is no oyster and no warm people, make tea and wait. He took it to Caro like a priest taking a relic and she read it aloud with a reverence that did not shade into piety. She told him she had a fisherman who would come in on Friday at dawn with one more crate and would do so only because he had an argument with his brother and did not wish to have breakfast in the same room, and that fate, in the end, is just logistics with a mask.

Friday dawned with a promise of frost that the day did not keep, and Tom found himself on a quay again watching a man in a boat bring an argument to shore. The air had that metallic taste you get when the seasons are changing hands, and he felt, almost superstitiously, that the pie would notice and either behave or not based on the light alone. Caro taught him how to open a shell without offending it, and she did it with the calm of someone who rejects duels and accepts dances. He tried and failed and then tried again and did not fail, and she made a noise that was not quite applause but carried the same social function. They drove back with the crate in the back as if escorting somebody’s grandmother, and he took a photograph at the red light because the shells looked like architecture and he wanted the proof.

In the afternoon, Mrs Clegg held a rehearsal for volunteers because rehearsal is the way people who care keep the rest of us honest. She walked them through water and wiping and where the nurse would stand and what to do should a child run up on stage and decide to help. She reminded men gently that they were not there to be large but to be useful, and she reminded women that eye contact is a resource best deployed like jam. Fin delivered a small speech about how to dispose of plates without making the hall smell like bin day, and he blushed halfway through and then finished anyway because bravery is nearly indistinguishable from embarrassment if you’ve not practised either. At the end, Rowan handed out packets of mints with a message that said for after, not for during, and everyone behaved like the warden of a prison had just handed them weapons and instructions on when not to use them.

Trevor appeared at the rehearsal as a “concerned citizen,” which is how he referred to himself when he wished to take credit divorced from labour. He leaned on a table with his weight distributed in a way that men do when they have been told they have presence, and he asked whether the press would be given appropriate access to the stage. Mrs Clegg told him that the press would be given whatever access did not interfere with the work of charity, and that as far as she was concerned the press were an interesting species that were welcome to observe but not to feed. He laughed with the politeness of a man who had been told a joke he did not understand and did not dare admit it, and he left with a water bottle in his hand that he had been given by a tenor who had insisted he drink because it was a hot day in his own mind and there was no arguing with weather like his.

On the way out, Maureen showed Tom the laminated running order as if it were the Magna Carta. It had his name in bigger letters than suited him and there was a star by The People’s Pie that could only have been put there by someone who had refused to listen to reasonable argument. He asked her if she remembered the year Maeve had stopped a fight in the churchyard and Maureen told him that she had in fact started it by telling two men they were fools, because sometimes a fight is just delayed truth and somebody has to get it over with. She squeezed his forearm in a way that would have been patronising if it had not come from someone whose hand had been on the shoulder of half the town at their worst and their best, and she told him that being first in a final was cowardice or courage depending on who watched. He told her he would be neither and she told him he would fail at that because that is what boys like him do.

The last evening before the final crept in with the velvet of a cat that intends to sit on your lap whether or not you have agreed. Tom didn’t want to be alone with it because he knew the evening would talk too much, and he wandered out under the lamplight to where the town lets the sea borrow its air. The pier had opinions, as usual, but they were quiet ones. He found himself at Caro’s door without performing the miracle of choosing it, and she opened to him with flour on the heel of her hand and the smell of butter and certainty. They ate standing up at her tiny counter because chairs would have made the conversation about endings and neither of them was ready to be tidy. She told him she had made three versions of a gravy in which oysters could hide or declare themselves, and he told her that he had written out his grandmother’s note twice and put one copy in his pocket like a boarding pass. She teased him for overpreparing and then told him she was worse and had pre-measured forgiveness for men who would be insufferable in the morning.

They practised, not eating, but stopping. It seemed odd until it didn’t. She made him take a bite and then put the fork down, and made him talk about something else for three breaths, and then let him take another bite while she watched his mouth as if she could persuade it to be strategic. He taught her a cadence pilots use when they are running the checks before a major departure, and she stole two of the phrases and inserted them into the kitchen with a naturalness that made him think perhaps kitchens and cockpits borrowed from the same ancestor. When she laughed at the bit about mixture rich he forgot, for a second, that the room was a place and not a state, and then he remembered in time and put his hands in his pockets like a boy reprieving himself.

He walked home past the Copper Pigeon where the quiz sheets had been left out on the bar like post-mortems and a man with a fist for a laugh was singing the chorus of a song that everybody knew and nobody admitted to liking. He thought of the spoon, safe on its shelf being domestic and brave, and he thought of the sky, waiting for him as it always did to point out the horizon and ask him to behave. On his doormat there was an envelope with no handwriting at all, just a stamp and the affronted cleanliness of a printer. Inside, there was a postcard of the pier from nineteen seventy-something with the colours misprinted in a way that made the water look like the inside of a bottle. On the back, in black ink that had been pressed down harder than necessary, somebody had written, in capitals: YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL. It should have stung and it didn’t. He found a pen and underneath wrote WE ARE before he tucked it under the biscuit tin, and he did not know whether the answer was petty or holy and did not mind, because both had their place in a town like this.

Sleep did not so much arrive as consent to be negotiated. He lay there and listened to the town settle its shoulder blades. The shipping forecast came in like a relative with a useful hobby and told him what would happen to places he would not go tomorrow, and it calmed something in him he did not know had been outside walking the dog. He told Maud she had done well today and that she would be relieved of duty until he had something to tell her that was not foolish, and he told the map that he had never forgiven it for making all distances a matter of time. He fell asleep with his hand on the pocket where the note from Maeve lived, and woke to the gull deputising the sky with its usual conviction and the world, at least for the length of a kettle, pretending anything could be ordinary if enough of you agreed.Chapter 8

The town woke with its hair done. Even the bus shelters looked like they had decided to be photogenic for the benefit of distant relatives. The gull gave its morning bulletin with extra consonants and the waves, as if agreeing to be a backdrop, tidied their hems along the shingle. Tom told himself not to name the day as if naming would jinx it, and then he named it anyway because humans are ridiculous and words need work. He boiled Maud and let her sigh be the cue for his chest to loosen, and he read the forecast as if the isobars had opinions about pastry. The map above the kettle was factual and unhelpful. The corner by Alderney had a pale smudge that suggested indecision, and his pilot-brain flickered through contingencies before his pie-brain told it, gently, to sit down.

Ops had sent a message the night before that was almost apologetic. Could he cover an early Jersey hop and back? The schedule was tight enough to make a saint breathe shallow, but Ramesh had added a line in his serious handwriting that said: I will take the second leg if needed; leave you time to make a fool of yourself with dignity. Trust me more than you trust the rota. He did. He trusted Ramesh with the dispersed loyalty he had for men who had taught parts of his body how to do their work without shouting.

The flight behaved like a child bribed with sweets. There was one moment on climb when the air had a thought and then decided against it, and on arrival a crosswind offered the sort of rehearsal only a show-off would ignore. He flew the numbers, spoke the calls, watched the stream of little things that can become big things if you take your eyes off them, and when the tyres whispered, he could picture Maureen telling him that competence is a form of charity. Ramesh took the right seat on the way home and made the sort of half-frown you make when a colleague you pretend not to admire has done something that will not embarrass your mother. “Go,” he said, when they rolled to the stand. “Drink your water without adjectives.”

St Stephen’s Hall had given itself to bunting. The colours were the ones the town understood as its own: a blue negotiated by sky and sea, a red only ambitious postboxes pull off, a white borrowed from the edges of waves. The stage was a neat riot; jugs like soldiers at ease; plates in ranks; a nurse by the fire exit with the patience of a tree. Mrs Clegg had a whistle she would never blow because her voice could perform its function better, and she carried a clipboard like it was a policy document submitted to a benevolent dictatorship. Maureen’s scarf had gone back to flame and arranged itself with the smugness of a sunset. Fin had acquired a second lanyard and the gait of a man who had once stopped a chair from falling and been thanked for it in writing.

The Boring Water Brigade were posted at points like commas, and Rowan moved among them with a list that had shed three names and gained three others as the week had taught her who could be relied upon to treat vigilance like a sport. She handed Tom a bottle whose label bore the small sticker Fin had printed and laminated as if he feared water would escape its duties without a certificate. “Don’t sip,” she said. “Drink when your mouth says to, not when your head tries to be clever.” Her eyes were moving in the triangular pattern of someone who has balanced a pub till and a calamity and does not intend to drop either.

“You’re a tyrant,” he said, and the word tasted like gratitude.

“I am a public service announcement with legs,” she said. “Look at you, all full of virtue and nonsense. Eat a banana. No, not that banana—this banana. The other banana is for emergencies.”

Caro appeared like a sensible thought and pressed a small square of bread into his hand. It had butter and a smear of something that might have been mustard if mustard had learned to be polite. “Mouth memory,” she said, in the way a person talks about something older than advice. “There is a mouth that knows steam and a mouth that knows heat and there is a mouth that panics. Give the right one first pick.” She had flour on the thumb she used to gesture, and he had to stop himself reaching for her hand with the astonishing certainty you reach for a book you have not yet read but know will forgive you for the delay.

The hall filled with a sound that kitchens recognise: a dozen conversations binding into a single hum. People who did not go to church adopted the church walk and lowered their voices because old wood has opinions. The woman from the paper had a new notebook and a pen with a feather at the end that suggested she had run out of normal pens and had embraced the theatre of her job. The radio presenter was there with a microphone and a smile that knew how to survive contact with Maureen. Izzy cruised the aisles like a ship with a mission and fixed a ribbon on a toddler with the exactness of a surgeon; the toddler immediately tore it off because toddlers understand that ceremony is a suggestion.

The final promised one departure from habit and the town had agreed to enjoy it in advance. The People’s Pie, valiant and democratically assembled by those few cooks who had won the right to be invisible, had been made in two equal versions to accommodate the town’s dual personality: one meat, one not-meat in a way that was not apology but craft. The rules were stingy with time and generous with sense. There would be no swapping of plates, no halfway theatrics, no commentary from the floor. If a man felt odd, he would raise his hand and the room would treat oddness as what it is—information, not drama.

Running order had been negotiated by lots and an undercurrent of mischief. Fate, which sometimes likes a punchline, had put Tom first. He took his chair with his spoon in his pocket and the feeling that he could hear his grandmother clear her throat. Trevor had been placed fourth by the algorithm and glowered like a man who suspected the algorithm of socialism. Farah sat two chairs down with the calm of a person who knows her hands will not betray her, and the older man with slow fists had earned a seat because the town understands that tenacity is a form of charity too. There was a teenager with hair like a hedgerow who held his fork like a pencil, and a woman with a coaching whistle around her neck who had not blown it in ten years and never in public.

Mrs Clegg called them to order like a harbourmaster talking to boats. “We remember why,” she said, and she did not have to say more. The why shimmered at the edge of everyone’s vision without being solemn about it. The nurse adjusted her watch. Auntie Mags and two baritones took up positions stage left with programmes rolled in their hands like wands. At the back by the doors, three uncles examined hinges in the manner of men whose faith is practical and expressed in oil.

It started in the ordinary way, which is to say the way humans make rituals out of nonsense. Plates lifted and cutlery made the countryside of noise polite. The first mouthful was a declaration. The pastry was shy of flake but sure of shortening; the filling was the sort of mushroom that remembers earth; there was thyme in it like a story told twice. He used his spoon the way he had trained himself—under, lift, expose, breathe—so the steam that had been waiting to scald would think better of it. He took a drink and let the water be exactly what the sticker said it was. If earlier in the week he had imagined the town watching as a single animal, now he felt them alight on him only when he asked them to. He made his mouth do the work and left the rest of him alone.

He was three bites in when he saw the first odd thing that had nothing to do with food. In the aisle to his left, a man pretending to be on his phone selected angles no phone consults. It was not the jacket—Fiske had learned to be elsewhere on days like this, perhaps because the choir had dented the fantasy that attention breeds fate—but it was a cousin in confidence. The man’s shoes were two different browns. Rowan saw him with the part of her face that does not move and made a notation on the list that had boxes instead of lines. By the time he looked again, the man had been offered a seat by a soprano whose charity had teeth.

Tom finished one plate with efficiency that did not advertise itself and moved on. Another smell. Another story. He stationed his breathing on the edge of appetite and let his spoon keep up. He thought, inevitably, of his grandmother’s kitchen, of the instructions in pencil that pretended to be kind and were, in fact, laws. He thought of the line in her note about warm people. He thought of Caro’s hand on the jar, the neat murder of the oyster, the way she had taught him to open without being cruel. He thought, for a second, of planes, because it is often the case that when you intend to be entirely in one world, the other will arrive and stand against the doorjamb to make sure you remember your belongs are distributed.

Trevor went at his plate like an argument he had paid to have. He had the performance down to a brand: the wipe of the mouth with the back of the hand calculated to make women in the third row say “oh, him” with unity, the glance at the camera that would later require a filter, the quick swallow that men make when their pride refuses to consult their esophagus. He finished his first with a flourish and took a drink as if the water had been made for him, and he tried to make the room accept that the “ah” he made afterwards was natural rather than choreographed. The room, having been trained by many women to tell the difference, accepted nothing and waited.

It happened before anybody had time to decide they had seen it. A motion in Trevor’s throat became a halt; the swallow that had been a signature refused to sign the paper. His jaw, that civic landmark, worked once and then again without result. The chair under him, familiar with this sort of bravado, shifted with a small squeal that birth certificates do not account for. His eyes did the particular thing eyes do when men discover their bodies are not sovereign states but federations.

There are rooms that gasp because they have never rehearsed the other option. This room did not. The nurse moved like a thought arriving exactly when needed. Tom stood in a single motion as if someone had lifted a string attached to the base of his spine. He was there, behind Trevor, while Trevor still had breath enough to be offended. He did not think about the contest; he thought about the drill you do on Day One of certain classes. He put one hand across and one under, angled in the taught way that respects ribs and grudges and time. He did not perform heroism; he performed the sensible anatomy of it. The nurse took over because that is what nurses do: reclaim the centre of events from men and return order to its desk. Three firm movements and an introduction to humility later, something that had been too much became not-enough and air returned like a relative who has found a parking space.

Trevor made the noise men make when they intend to insist they’d had it under control. It is a noise composed of dignity and swallowed embarrassment and a sprinkle of gratitude they will deny if asked in front of witnesses. He stood with the help of nobody, which is to say with the help of three women and the knowledge that falling now would turn into a story he would be forced, forever, to laugh about at Christmas. He leaned on the table with one elbow and looked at Tom with an expression so complicated it was almost useful. He did not say thank you because he did not have that tool in the box; he grunted, which in his dialect was either praise or misfire.

Tom stepped back so the nurse could be the person in the light. He sat down because apparently some part of him had calculated the moment and reserved a seat in the aftermath. He looked at his plate and then at Mrs Clegg, who indicated, with the smallest possible tilt of her nose, that time was a river and he should step back into it when he was ready. He did not immediately pick up his fork because sometimes hands have to be told twice. The room adjusted itself around the corrected shape of the event. Farah, who had paused with the good sense of the competent, resumed with the same attention as before. The teenager with the hedgerow hair looked at Tom with the eyes of someone filing a life rule. The older man, who had been waiting for a sign that kindness could take precedence without making him foolish, took a drink and breathed.

Tom ate the remainder like a person doing a job he could respect. He was slower than he had been a minute ago because the body has its own opinions about adrenaline and digestion, and he refused to haggle. He did not win, not in the calculation that would require a ribbon. Farah did, as she deserved to, with a neatness that made admiration easy; she took the applause and turned it outward the way women are trained to broker attention. The teenager came third and cried into a programme as if that had been the plan all along. Trevor finished because those men always do, and when he stood he allowed the nurse to pat his arm in public, which is as close as some fellows ever come to confession.

The ribbons were distributed with the brisk tenderness Mrs Clegg had refined over eight festivals and three separate campaigns against things she considered vulgar. There were speeches that pretended they were not speeches because Dorset likes to sneak sense into jokes. A cheque was hoisted and then lowered as if it were a sail. The photograph that would appear in Bournemouth Today was taken at an angle that made the hall look expansive and the people look good at being people. Maureen took the microphone, which everyone knows is a ceremony, and described the thing they had done as an act of collective sanity dressed as nonsense. She did not, at any point, say the word hero, which is how you praise men without contributing to their sales.

After, when the hall became the back end of the circus and everybody knew where everything went without looking, Trevor came up to Tom with the tentative gait of a man approaching a fence he has previously spat over. He had lost a bit of colour and with it a measure of self-regard. He performed, haltingly, the ritual: a hand extended, a look that avoided eyes long enough to be considered. Tom took the hand because he is the sort of man who cannot pass a test he set for himself. “I had it,” Trevor lied, softly.

“I know,” Tom lied back, with equal politeness.

“A man doesn’t like to be—” Trevor began, and trailed off as Mrs Clegg, passing with a tray of borrowed crockery, made a soft noise that translated as and yet.

Rowan found him near the stack of folded chairs with a report dressed as gossip. Fiske had tried to get in, had been greeted by the new door policy (two altos, one bass, a man named Barry who looked like a bench), and had discovered that there are ways to erase a person without lifting a finger. “He’ll go sniff at Poole,” she said. “He’ll tell a story about being misunderstood, and some men there will nod because it’s cheaper than self-examination. He is not our moral any more.”

“Was he ever?” Tom asked, out of something that might have been curiosity and might have been the last spasm of wanting a villain to be tidy.

“For a minute,” she said, with the justice of a town clerk. “Long enough to teach us the difference between vigilance and paranoia. We have laminated the difference. Fin will present a workshop.” Fin, as if summoned, knocked his knee into a trestle table, apologised to the table, and laughed at himself with the grace of a person who will lead well one day if he does not combust.

Caro brought Tom a glass of something that was mostly apple and a little ginger and called it an argument in favour of continuing. He drank it right down to prove he was persuadable. She looked at him like you look at a wall you intend to put a shelf on—not critically, but with an appreciation for load-bearing. “You can let yourself be second,” she said, which in her language meant many things and all of them fair. “It suits you. You’re made to catch.”

“I wanted to be faster,” he said, because honesty is a muscle and if you do not flex it in front of people who deserve it, it goes to seed.

“You were,” she said. “Fast in the ways that count.” She glanced, not accidentally, at where the nurse was folding a blanket. “I’m told you fly with hands like that. I’m told you say unable when intelligent men would try to be impressive.”

He looked at her and felt laughter move under his ribs like a tide; controlled, inevitable, bigger than him. “Sometimes I pretend I invented unable,” he said. “And sometimes I forget I didn’t.”

“Your gran wrote it down,” she said, with a smile that acknowledged how the dead never stop editing us.

People pressed his hand and put cups of tea he didn’t need near his elbow. He sought out Mrs Clegg to thank her because there is no universe in which you do not thank the general, and she tolerated his gratitude the way a woman who has seen men cry over raffle prizes tolerates sincerity—gruffly, kindly, with the hint that she might set you to stacking chairs if you go on. “Next year,” she said, wagging her pen, “you will join the Brigade for the heats and learn the pleasures of policing water.”

“Next year,” he said, and found he meant it without wincing. In him the giddy energy that events leave behind was settling to something like warmth.

He walked out into the afternoon with its light lowered a notch and the wind having a good day. The pier had put its face on for photographs and was ready to go back to rust. He set off in no exact direction and let his feet think. People he did not know called his name in the way you call a dog you want to pet but don’t want to frighten, and he waved. A boy on a bicycle did a loop round him and then, unembarrassed, said that his mum had cried a little when he did the hand thing because his mum cried at men being decent, which is a burden and an honour. A woman from the library pressed a bookmark on him that had a line from a poem about appetite and restraint and a cartoon of a pie with eyes; he put it in his pocket with the spoon and the folded note from Maeve and thought, with the half-irony that keeps you safe, that he was becoming, inescapably, the sort of man who collects talismans.

He did not intend to stop by Caro’s shop and, of course, stopped. The chalkboard had been wiped and redrawn as if the day required a new verb tense. Inside, the smell was an argument between butter and air that made sense only because both participants were kind. There was a woman at the counter buying a loaf and a sentence about courage, and Tom stood back and looked at the photographs pegged along the wall as if they were a score and he had been permitted to have a try at singing it. When it was his turn, Caro did not ask him what he wanted because he did not have the words ready. She put a plate in front of him with a slice of something that was not sweet and not savoury but an idea, and he ate it and discovered pistachio where he had not expected it and approved.

They stood, later, in the doorway the way you do in a town when lingering is a profession. She told him, because she had promised herself she would, that her father had once been saved on a boat by a man who had not made a fuss and had not accepted a pint because the man had been saving should be a quiet business, and she had been thinking about that ever since the day she had seen him lift his hand over a plate of something wrong. He told her that he had received a postcard telling him he was not special and had written we are on it, and she laughed and said that if he were foolish enough to give it to her she would put it in the window beside the sign about repairs to armour and see if anyone recognised the handwriting.

He walked home in the sweet disorder after community and let his brain do the relaxation it does when the problem of being seen has been temporarily taken away. He cooked nothing and ate bread with ham as if ham had been invented for days like this, and he phoned his mother to tell her the good version of events, in which he had been competent and not sanctimonious, and she told him that men who can be both are rare and ought to be given clean tea towels and the keys to the hall. He went to bed with the map watching him like a patient teacher, and he lay still long enough to hear the town put its chairs up on its tables and sweep.

In the morning there was work, because the world insists upon balance. He took the first leg with Ramesh and the sky presented him with one of those days that would be described by people who don’t fly as “fine” and by pilots as “interesting.” A bank of cloud sat with intent off the west, and the radio was busy with people negotiating the proper degree of caution. He made the call on final that men make who remember the taste of unable and are not ashamed of it; he went around, politely, with no drama, and earned himself and his passengers a landing that belonged on a postcard rather than in a report. He thought, as he eased the yoke, of jugs and hands and Boring Water stickers and the way a town will teach you to make the sensible gesture look like a bold one because it keeps glory cheap and kindness expensive.

Bournemouth Today ran their photograph with a line underneath that was too earnest and therefore forgivable. The radio station played a song with pie in the chorus and everyone pretended not to mind. The betting shop on Gervis Place paid out and lost and shrugged because this had never been about money. Trevor was seen in the Copper Pigeon buying two pints for the nurse and standing just outside the circle of their gratitude, which is about as good as it gets for men like him for a while. Farah accepted flowers and added them, expertly, to a vase that had been waiting for the precise moment. Fin found a new purpose: he started a zine, printed on a photocopier that once ate three dissertations and was therefore owed respect, in which he wrote about being eighteen and useful and put in a diagram of a bicycle that could make toast which he swore he would build. Auntie Mags posted a list on the hall noticeboard: Boring Water Brigade, permanent. Underneath, someone had drawn a small, neat spoon.

Caro mended a loaf tin with a screwdriver so delicate it should have had its own box and told a woman who was leaving town that she could post her tins back for repair if the city she was going to forgot how hinges work. Rowan brokered a petty dispute between the man who painted the centre lines and the woman who ran Pilates over the placement of a cone, and by tea time everyone had agreed that cones are not the hill to die on. Izzy put the napkin with her stop being noble note in a box with other paper reminders and tidied her desk, which is how she tells herself and the world that chaos is both welcome and adjudicated. Ramesh drank a mint tea and sent Tom a message that said simply: unable is a love song to physics.

The anonymous postcard that had told him he was not special sat under the biscuit tin until it had absorbed the sensible smell of years. He retrieved it, looked at the block letters, and thought that whoever had written it had thought they were guarding his soul and had in fact been inviting him to share it around. He propped it on the shelf beside the spoon, and that evening, when the light from the pier remembered the part where it turns each bulb into a coin, he sent a photograph of both to Caro. She replied with a picture of her gran’s ladle and the caption: we inherit the correct weapons if we’re lucky.

He did not imagine that every week would arrange itself with this much meaning. He did not expect the sky to be grateful. He took the quiet where it came and kept a little jar of it on a mental shelf. The festival would be reviewed and become folklore; the town would turn it into a story about itself in which it had been noble and silly and good at chairs. He would go back to the crew room and to the map and to the radio voice that drops half an octave because calm can be borrowed like a jumper. He would walk past St Stephen’s and glance in at the place where fun had happened and somebody would have left a balloon that would still be alive, which is a metaphor so brave it ought to be embarrassed.

On Tuesday of the next week, as he walked home from a shift where the wind had turned on itself and become a sermon, he saw the jacket man not being a jacket man. Fiske was sitting on a bench with his coat folded beside him and a look on his face like a school report he did not enjoy. A child gave him a crisp without being told to because children have anarchic sympathy, and Fiske took it and seemed not to know where to put his hands. Tom did not stop because not every story requires an epilogue and not every man a second chance delivered by a narrator, but he did not harden himself either. He walked on and thought that if the town worked as intended Fiske would find himself redirected into the willing arms of uncles and glances, and if it did not, he would at least know the choir had breath to waste.

He went home and put the kettle on. Maud sighed with the severity of a woman whose job is the whole of civilisation and has been inadequately thanked. He told her she was enough. He lifted the spoon from the shelf and balanced it on his palm and felt, in that small, private, affectionate weight, the sanity of objects that had been taught their work and had met it with good humour. He opened the biscuit tin and a clipping he hadn’t seen before slid to the top, as if the tin, like the town, liked to reveal things on its own timetable. It was a recipe cut out decades ago for a chicken pie that claimed to improve with arguing. Maeve had underlined arguing and written, in her bossy, clear hand: yes, but only up to a point. He laughed at the kitchen like a man who has got away with goodness and expects to be caught, and he poured his tea and looked at the map and let the day fall around him in pieces big enough to see and small enough to forget.Chapter 9

The town, having spent a week patting its own back with one hand and making tea with the other, remembered the usefulness of ordinary. Monday’s bin lorry did its grumbling rounds as if it had personally been asked to tidy the remains of nonsense, and the pier took its lights down two notches like a piano being respectful at a funeral. Tom let himself be seduced by the ritual of it; he talked to Maud with the extra politeness of a man buying time, and he nodded at the map as if it might reach down and smooth a crease in his day with an isobar. The article in Bournemouth Today faded into the strata of other clippings on the fridge under a magnet shaped like an aubergine, and the BORING WATER stickers started popping up in places that had no business being hydrological—the back of the bus driver’s clipboard, a lamppost near the library, the corner of a school trumpet case—because Fin had found a roll of them that nobody had remembered to hide.

The envelope from St Stephen’s arrived with the officious cheerfulness of a school report. Mrs Clegg’s handwriting had the emphatic slant of a woman instructing history to sit correctly. They were, she informed him, beginning a series of Saturday sessions named with unembarrassed pragmatism Safe Hands, in which the town would learn not to be stupid around throats and hearts. The nurse from the final had agreed to teach; Maureen had agreed to shout; what they required of him, and this was written without apology, were his wrists and his face. “You will stand up and say why and then you will sit down and demonstrate without being theatrical,” the letter declared, as if the possibility of theatre had ever occurred to the part of him that considered posture a loan from his grandmother. He put the letter on the shelf beside the spoon and watched as, without being occult about it, the spoon seemed to approve.

Rowan messaged him before he could draft a reply that managed to say yes without consigning himself to any posters. She had already drawn up a rota and a second rota in case the first rota developed opinions, and had set aside the front room of Errand Boy as a staging ground for manikins, mints and tea. Fin was drawing diagrams with arrows so confident you could hear them land. “We’ll do it like a school disco,” she said when he dropped in that afternoon. “You won’t have to speak for long, and the lights will be kinder than they were in 2006.” She had the look of a woman who had sorted three deliveries, four egos and a misunderstanding about cake forks before breakfast and was not actively bored.

The week itself did small acts of weather like a person trying on hats. A thin rain turned pavements into palettes and then thought better of it; a wind from somewhere older than Bournemouth came in and reminded people that coats have a nature of their own. Ramesh flew with a neatness that suggested his hands had had a talk with gravity over a mint and reached an arrangement. “My cousin in Leicester,” he said casually on descent, “says your pie business has now been turned into an acronym by her WhatsApp group. Apparently BWB is something they are going to insist upon at all community events, births to funerals.” He adjusted the throttles with the bored love of a man who had envisioned a world in which sensible acronyms run everything. “Tell them I invented it if it gets me invited to fewer weddings.”

Caro had the kind of week bakers call honest. The dough rose and fell like a tide she had negotiated personally, and the oven made its small, irritable speeches and then delivered on its promises because she had developed the knack of not taking offence. She sent him, on Wednesday, a message that included a photograph of a key that looked older than most local laws. “Do you see this,” she wrote. “It is permission to break into the past. Come after your shift, bring sleeves that don’t mind soot.” When he arrived at the address, he found a door set back into brick like a secret had gone to ground. The sign above it, B. Vaughan & Son, had given up on its own gold paint sometime in 1993 and now wore dignity instead.

Inside, the air had the smell of places that have contained every version of a conversation and retired none of them. It was a long, narrow room with an oven buried in the wall on the left like a sleeping animal; on the right, a run of shelves still holding tins in the shape of loaves with dents that were declarations. Caro stood with her sleeves rolled, hair tied up with an elastic band apparently commandeered from a World War II supply depot, and flour already finding her as if it had been told where to gather. “It’s not mine,” she said, before he could turn reverence into embarrassment. “Yet. But it has been left to be loved by the first person who promises to let it work again, and I am attempting to be that person.”

The oven had a door like a vault and a draft that sulked. Caro knocked on the iron the way you knock on a stubborn friend. “She’s a Scotch oven,” she said, fond and bossy. “She will not forgive you if you are careless about air. We are going to clean her flue and pretend we went on a course that covered soot in depth.” She had done her homework: a brush with a handle long enough to chastise a man in denial; sheets to cover a floor that would never be clean again; a small lamp that took the seriousness out of shadow. He found himself falling into the contentment he gets from a system with parts. There were dampers he could point to and say name; there were hinges that sighed in the same language everywhere; there was the hopeful feeling of a machine being coaxed back into remembering that it exists to be useful and not just picturesque.

They were an odd set of labourers and perfectly matched: Caro in the oven throat with her neat shoulders, soot on her cheek like war paint that had learned to mind its manners, and Tom at the far end persuading the flue to release a decade of stubborn. They did not discuss anything too earnest because earnestness and soot do not make good company; they talked about how the word damper is rude and ought to be replaced and how sometimes an oven requires you to flirt and sometimes to be kind without wooing. When the first grey avalanche presented itself with a thump to the sheet on the floor, they exchanged the sort of look people exchange when something has been named correctly on the first try. When they had finished and she had lit a small, experimental fire of newspaper and the first finger of smoke went up and out rather than back and into their chests, he let himself laugh with satisfaction and she let him see it.

“Do you ever think,” she said, sitting on an upturned milk crate while the oven tried on the idea of being warm, “that we have chosen the same job with different uniforms? You tell air where to go without telling it how to feel, and so do I. You ask heat to behave. You apologise for nothing and for everything.” He handed her a bottle of water that had not been laminated but had been judged and passed, and she drank and arranged her mouth into the shape of a person resisting charm.

He looked around the place and let the smell of old bread and older patience make its case. On a shelf by the till there was a ledger with a leather spine that had seen fingers and found them satisfactory. He opened it because some books only exist to be opened and because Caro had nodded without warning him off. The names went back forty years and forward to ten, a chorus of weddings and wakes and Thursdays. His finger stopped across a line halfway down a page where the ink had a different attitude to itself. Hatherley, it said, and he felt breath behave. Maeve had a credit in a hand that had not attempted beauty because it had been busy. It had, under items supplied, read simply flour, lard, patience. Under remarks someone had written in another hand with an era in it, Paid in pies, you should be so lucky. He showed Caro like you show a person a photograph of the door your past came through. She grinned the grin decent people use when they find a stitch that holds two things together and test it with their fingers.

They left the oven to consider its responsibilities and walked back through the arcades as the shops did their day-end courting of customers with lights and honesty. Outside, a boy kicked a football with the solemnity of an oath. Fin almost ran into them while reading his own zine and then leveraged the accident into a sales pitch without losing his place, which is a skill only certain eighteen-year-olds can call instinct. “I’ve done a section on spotting a jug that doesn’t look trustworthy,” he said with the fervour of a man announcing an expedition. “It’s mostly about eyebrows.”

“Make sure you include a paragraph about men in jackets who call themselves after fish,” Rowan said, appearing like a sentence that improves a paragraph. She had a bag full of string and tape that usually suggests a polemic and today meant she had been tying kindness to corners. “Auntie Mags says he’s been seen apologising to a bin at the bus station, which she interprets as progress.” Her mouth did a thing that either meant pity or an allergy. “Also, Saturday. Bring your wrists. The nurse is promising us the stern version of compassion.”

Safe Hands was exactly what it needed to be: a hall full of people with egos checked at the door by two altos and a poster of diagrams that had been hand-drawn with enough conviction to count as scripture. The manikins had been worn by life and disinfectant, and they stared at the ceiling as if there were better jokes to be found up there. The nurse—Helen, it turned out, with a history of being the calm in rooms where energy panics—stood at the front and translated fear into instruction. She did not make anyone feel small; she made them feel possible. Maureen spoke for exactly forty-five seconds and in that period persuaded three couples who had been pretending not to row to stand closer. Mrs Clegg introduced Tom without adjectives, pointed at him with her pen in a manner that endowed pens with moral purpose, and stepped aside.

He said the thing that needed saying and kept his tone in the range he uses for descent into Guernsey. He did not say hero; he said practice. He did not say save; he said help. He did not show off the problem with Trevor and the nurse because that would have turned a room into a theatre, and the room deserved better than acting. He demonstrated the sensible violence of a manoeuvre named after a man whose name nobody in the room could pronounce the same way, and he let his wrists be visible without being flashy about it. Helen moved among hands and straightened thumbs and corrected angles with a patience that taught you how to keep deliberate in a world fond of speed.

Trevor turned up late and sat in the back with a face composed of apology and sulk. He did not raise his hand when volunteers were called for because it would have required him to admit prior knowledge of choking. After the break—biscuits that had not been out of tins long and tea poured by people who had been trained to fill cups to an appropriate civilised degree—he stood up anyway. “Go on then,” he said to Helen, not to be a man but failing to be anything else, and she allowed him to be demonstrated upon with a competence that erased the need for anybody to be brave. He stood under it without dramatics, put his hands on his own chest like a man hearing a song he’d once danced to, and afterwards he stared at the floor in a way that might have been grief and might have been relief. He did not thank Tom. He nodded at him like a soldier who has decided the general he despises also can count. It was, given the arc of Trevor as a civic fable, quite a good ending for a mid-chapter lesson.

Work, meanwhile, stuck elbows back into his day with cheerful insistence. Tuesday brought a front that had not read the memo about moderation, and the runway had its own views at just the point where you ask it to be bland. Tom talked to the sky in numbers and to Ramesh in glances, and they did the small, rewarding thing that is avoiding drama. “This is all any of it is,” Ramesh said afterwards in the crew room, stirring a tea so weak it might as well have been gossip. “Enough prudence to let luck behave. Also my aunt says she saw you on a poster for something at the hall and wishes to know if you are now a member of the clergy.”

Caro’s oven forgave heat in stages. They went back on Thursday night to feed it a slow diet of fire and more fire until it remembered how to hold warmth without throwing it back like an insult. The first test loaves came out with shoulders and shy bottoms and a willingness to be improved. Caro grinned the grin of a person watching her hand become an instrument and said something dangerously affectionate about the sound crust makes when it cracks exactly where it is meant to. He told her he had never wished to be bread more in his life and she accused him of charm in a tone that suggested forgiveness would be available if lodged correctly.

They planned, in that shorthand people acquire when their days have started to lean towards each other, a Night-Bake. There would be a table in the window and a donation tin with numbers on it that meant something for the library and for Mrs Clegg’s stubborn project of taking boredom out of water and danger out of hands. There would be three pies at midnight—one for the saints who eat, one for the saints who do not, one for the people who have not yet decided—and there would be bread at five in the morning for the lorry drivers who had seen too much and would be grateful for the simple politics of a loaf. He would fly earlier and then come to stand and be useful and not set anything on fire. She would pretend not to be moved by any of it because she had learned, young, to distrust a day that promised milk and honey.

Because the city thrives on best-laid plans the way children thrive on sugar, the weather decided to do a thing on Friday that forced an argument between timetables and virtue. Alderney disappeared under a blanket as if practicing being a rumour. The Jersey hop was on, then maybe, then on if, then postponed with an apology and a cheerful suggestion that passengers might like to reacquaint themselves with patience. Tom chose unable twice, and each time he felt in his bones the muscle memory of a roomful of people lifting their hands for the right reasons. He landed late, with the light doing that trick where it makes everything look like it belongs to postcards, and ran home not because he was behind but because the part of him that stays thirteen whenever ovens are involved wanted to see flame do the thing it does when it approves of a room.

It nearly went wrong in the way that teaches caution more kindly than injury. They had lit early to line the belly of the oven with heat; they had fed the mouth with air because some marriages require ceremony, and Caro had taken that look a captain takes when a boat acquires personality at precisely the point you need it to be a tool. Then the wind shifted outside, small but deliberate, and the draft stuttered. The smoke, impatient and without malice, considered a detour into lungs. He tasted the warning and spoke the checklists like a man retailing a prayer in a borrowed church. Caro cursed in a dialect he did not know she owned and hauled open the back door while he went for the damper like a paramedic—push, angle, not yet, now—and Barry, who had been summoned for hinges and had stayed for biscuits, waded in with a screwdriver the size of a wand. The flue sulked and then remembered duty; the smoke reconsidered its plan; the room did the inhale that says idiots had a good day by accident.

They stood there, the three of them, in a smoky quiet intense enough to grow tomatoes. Caro put her hands on her hips to give them somewhere to be other than shaking. “Boring air,” she said, after a moment, and nobody laughed because respect is not incompatible with happiness. Barry adjusted a hinge that hadn’t asked to be adjusted but had been silently pleading for it from a moral standpoint, and he left, muttering something about men with screwdrivers being a necessary evil offset by cake.

Word spread, because word does, that Vaughan & Son was breathing again and that Caro had coaxed the old iron into remembering its name. People found reasons to pass the door. A woman in running shoes with a hairstyle that meant committee pressed her face to the glass, waved without embarrassment and promised chairs. A man from the council who had heard the word oven and had a list of inspections in his brain arrived, sniffed, in a different sense than Fin had diagrammed, and nodded with the kind of caution that means yes as long as nothing flamboyant occurs. Auntie Mags dispatched two altos and a strap, and within an hour the donation tin had been tethered to the leg of the counter in a way that would make a robber consider his options and cry.

The Night-Bake began with nothing much to commend it except heat and intent, which turned out to be a sufficient recipe for a queue. Caro moved in the concentration that is the opposite of secrecy. Tom took money and smiled the smile he reserves for people who think they are asking nothing of him when they are asking for his time. Izzy came and stood with a coat she had not fastened because she disapproved of buttons that late at night and took a turn at making change as if she had been producing coins in exact denominations since infancy. Rowan patrolled the pavement with a thermos and a list that had acquired scribbles during the day and would acquire more before dawn. Fin collected names for a page he was calling “Who Ate When It Was Sensible To Be Asleep,” which would somehow end up as part of a grant application because he had a surprising mind for bureaucracy when it wore good shoes.

At midnight, when the usual drunks had either found their sofas or fallen out with them, he carried to the window ledge three pies and saw his breath lift with the steam. The meat one was the kind of brown that makes you rethink your opinions about adjectives; the not-meat one had a sheen that made it fit to be a portrait. The third was small and complicated and had oysters in it because the sea had allowed itself to be involved in a private matter. Caro handed him a plate with the seriousness that only attaches to public joy and said, not loudly, “For your gran.” He cut the first slice with attention and put it on a napkin with a pattern of flowers that refused to be demure, and he ate it with the care you offer a memory when you do not want to spook it. He did not cry. He did not perform stoicism either. He let his face be the face of a man who has understood something without entirely being thanked for it, and he did not mind.

Between one and three the city belonged to the trade. Men with vans, women with bags, teenagers with a talent for turning anything into a social occasion, all took bread with the seriousness that attaches to warm food handed across old wood. People put notes in the tin without making theatre and coins in it with theatrical flourish. The radio in the corner sneaked a shipping forecast in because it knew its audience and let the list of sea areas do that thing to the air that language does when it has carried itself for years to the right ears. Tom, who can be faithful in rituals he did not invent, felt his bones unclench another degree.

At half past three, because nature enjoys a cameo, the jacket appeared outside with its owner looking like he had misread several signs. Fiske did not try the door. He stood and watched small, vivid life pass him in both directions and seemed to forget to be a threat. Caro saw him simply and poured a paper cup of tea she did not sweeten because she had remembered in some other part of her life that men who are used to sugar will accept bitterness if it is offered without pity. She passed it to him out of the door as if he were a normal person and said nothing except “Careful,” in that register you use for kettles and hearts. He took it and made the face men make when warmth goes into them faster than narrative. He said, to nobody who deserved to be identified, “I’m moving on.” Rowan, behind him, wrote in the air with her finger an invisible minute taken at an invisible meeting and did not approve it and did not deny it and let the wind decide its fate.

Dawn is a truth-teller most towns try to pretend is an amenity. At five, when the first pink napkin was laid across the top of the sky to make the blue remember itself, bread stopped being an idea and became breakfast. Bill from Mudeford took a loaf away under his arm like a child returned to its mother after an adventure. A council street-cleaner with opinions that could bend a shovel made a remark about the superiority of crust to politics and was rewarded with an end piece. The nurse took two small pies for people who would be waking up at the wrong time with sadness in their mouths, and she made a joke about the hospital’s new poster campaign, which featured a cartoon of a jug that had been anthropomorphised in ways that had caused a stern email.

They cleaned as if their dignity depended on it and perhaps it did. The oven sighed into rest like an animal that has been allowed to run and has remembered its den without prompting. Caro stood with a damp cloth and wiped the counter until it had the look of an object that could tell you what had happened upon it without witnesses. Tom washed trays with the careful repetitions he finds restful, and Izzy counted, double-counted and then refused to count again because at some point numbers should be allowed to be themselves. When they finally sat down, no longer in need of each other’s usefulness and not yet in a place where they would have to perform absence, Caro handed him the ledger without ceremony. There was a new entry in her hand, neat without pedantry, that read Maeve Hatherley’s boy: patience, wrist, an argument with smoke. He did not accuse his face of anything in front of witnesses. He looked at the word boy and found himself without contempt for it.

Sleep took him home like a bus you do not remember boarding. Maud was particularly disdainful when asked to provide tea after dawn, and he apologised to her like an unfaithful spouse asking for the good mugs. He slept with the window open because the air had proved itself boring and been granted privileges, and he woke to a message from his mother that gave him the sort of reprimand that doubles as a blessing. “I have read the paper,” she wrote. “I have spoken to three women at the greengrocer’s. I approve of you, in case you thought not. You will come on Sunday and bring something from that shop which I have decided belongs to me, and you will not argue about the need for sandwiches afterwards.”

The anonymous postcard made its way back into his mind like a cross pigeon finding the balcony it dislikes but needs. In the clear light of a day that had already earned its lunch, he took it down from the shelf and reconsidered its capitals. We are, he had written, and the little pronoun had behaved like a truce. Caro, when he took it to the shop with a bag of screws Barry insisted she would need before Thursday, squinted at the letters and laughed the laugh that comes out when you find a thread and know who spun it. “Carstairs,” she said, with wicked fondness. “He writes like a man telling you to depart his lawn and then remembers he sells combs, which obliges him to smile. He has a way of using capital letters that suggests a relationship with a typewriter that ended badly. He probably thought he was being generous. We will tell him, gently, that we decline to be warned off by men with stationery.”

They told him, gently, in front of his own window. Carstairs took the news with the grace of a man who insists he meant kindness and therefore must be credited with a degree of it. He admitted that he found men who became beloved at speed suspicious on behalf of women whose work had gone unloved for decades, and in doing so he performed, accidentally, a correct critique without the flair to make it cruel. Maureen, who had been buying nails with the judicious air of a person who understands the power inherent in small, sharp things, told him he was right and wrong and both at the same time and that she appreciated civic curmudgeons when they had the decency to make their own tea.

The town gave itself a week off from major plotlines and then failed, as is its habit, to stop inventing smaller ones. A school decided to hold a cake sale and called it an Allergen’s Delight with blithe optimism that was gently corrected by three mothers and a paediatrician. The Copper Pigeon introduced a new quiz round in which you had to identify birds by the way they judged you, and Fin won with a flourish and then wrote an editorial condemning the lack of wigeon representation. The Boring Water Brigade produced a pamphlet with cartoons that turned up in bathrooms like necessary graffiti; it had Rowan’s hand all over it and a drawing of a spoon nobody admitted to having made. The radio presenter tried to start a phone-in about whether pastry is a metaphor and hung up on himself after three calls from people who had misunderstood the question on purpose.

On a Tuesday afternoon that had set its face towards a sulk and then chosen magnanimity instead, Ramesh invited him to his sister’s for Diwali on Saturday with a note that managed to be shy and imperious in the same sentence. “There will be food,” the note said. “You will come and eat it and tell my aunt unable stories because she finds them erotic.” Tom replied with a promise to bring a pie that would make nobody ill and asked, overtly, whether bringing something shaped like home to a table shaped like someone else’s would be a kindness or an imposition. Ramesh replied with patience you reserve for boys you like who overthink bridges. “Bring a thing,” he wrote. “Do not be weird about bringing it.” Caro, when consulted in the way you consult a weather app before deciding whether to wear a coat, offered him a loan of her smallest tin and a jar of spice that would take his mouth to a country he had yet to visit. “Do not show off,” she said. “Be second. It suits you.”

There was, because balance is a tyrant that occasionally brings gifts, one more flight that took a sliver off his attention at exactly the wrong point and thereby proved that attention is a thing that can be put back if you have trained for that as well. The light over Alderney did that thin, handsome thing that makes you think you have read it correctly and then introduces a contrary. He listened to his instruments because they do not flirt and he deferred, again, at exactly the right moment, and when he said unable there was the sense in his chest—unfolding, satisfied—that he had made an offering to physics and had been allowed, in return, to keep his day. He landed at Bournemouth with tyres that spoke in the private patter of machines who have been kept within their vocation and he kissed his own teeth for behaving, which is a small superstition he had not intended to share with anyone.

Saturday was bright on purpose. Ramesh’s sister’s house had a front room that had discovered it could be a temple without asking for funding. Lights pinned themselves along walls that had seen exams and scoldings and cricket on television, and table after table laid out an argument in favour of abundance. Aunties summoned him with the sort of generosity men who have been fed correctly all their lives recognise as a principal. He took off his shoes and was given information about everybody’s slippers, and then he was made to sit and listen to arguments about laddoos that were both affectionate and, depending on how you have been trained to parse tone, doctrinal. He had brought a pie with a filling Caro had coached towards aromatic respect, and it arrived on the table without commentary like a cousin who has married into the family and is attempting to be useful. Ramesh performed introductions with a laziness that had clearly been rehearsed to look effortless and a pride he would pretend not to own. At some point an aunt did, in fact, request unable, and he found himself telling a group of women with bracelets that had opinions about light the story of saying no to a runway and yes to a second try, and the applause that followed was the kind you do not earn with speed.

On his way home, full of sugar he had not intended to consume and lentils that had performed theology, he passed the hall and found the door open and the lights on and Mrs Clegg at a table being exact about paper. He stopped because it is good practice to thank the gods in charge of the chairs. She told him that the cheque from the Night-Bake had caused the woman at the bank to remove her glasses and that this had been counted, in some circles, as a small miracle. He told her that the oven breathed like a cat you have decided to love and that it would be a crime if it did not become a place where the town brought its tired to be bread again. She made a noise that meant committees and then, from the drawer of a filing cabinet that had given up on its self-esteem, she produced a leaflet she had made on her domestic printer entitled The People’s Oven. “If the council will not understand this in their language,” she said briskly, “we will speak it in ours until it becomes their language too.”

He walked the long way home on purpose, let the lamplight spot the pavement like punctuation, counted dogs in coats and considered the moral hazard of small hats on greyhounds. He went up the steps to his flat and at the top, because cities like to end days with a card trick, he saw Fiske sitting on the landing with his coat folded and a look on his face like an apology that had not yet been translated. Fiske stood as if men were watching and said he had a sister in Poole who had a room if he could stop calling in favours and start making them. He did not ask for money. He did not ask for absolution. He asked, with an awkwardness that did not improve itself, whether Tom would tell the choir he was going so that they did not waste their breath on a man who had opted out of the melody. Tom said he would tell them that the town had done its part, and Fiske nodded as if that were a blessing and left in the way men leave when they do not own exits and are practicing. In the morning, Auntie Mags texted him a single word—Gone—and three biscuits, because the church has always had its own emoji.

Sunday was his mother’s, and he turned up with bread that was almost still speaking and a pie that had learned its manners, and she arranged plates with the fussiness of a minor official and then ruined the effect by laughing at herself. They ate, sensibly and with permission, on the good plates, and she said that she had met Caro at the market and had chosen not to tell her that she had smacked him with a wooden spoon once for trying to salt sugar because history ought not to be a public convenience. He told her about the oven and the ledger and Maeve’s credit, and she went quiet the way women go quiet when a detail sits down beside them and refuses to leave. Later he went up to the little room where he had been small and now was large, and he took out the biscuit tin and found that beneath the layer of blunt cards and paper clipped recipes there was a postcard he had not seen. It was of the pier, again, the light wrong, the colours wrong in the way the past insists on being wrong, and on the back in his grandmother’s hand it said, in the clear, bossy script that organised meals and men: Do not try to make a thing special by hurting it. Put your hand where it belongs. He sat on the floor and let the sentence earn him.

Back in his kitchen, he stuck the postcard above the kettle with a magnet shaped like a gull that had resigned from politics. Maud, whose patience had been spent on other men that day, forgave him the early start he was going to give her tomorrow and sighed in a way that suggested she, too, liked being part of a family of objects that had decided on a man. He looked at the map and moved a finger to Alderney and then away and let the shame of that superstition leave before it laid eggs. Outside, the pier rehearsed itself for an evening it would perform without him. Inside, he practiced, briefly and without drama, the movement of a hand towards a spoon and the replacement of it when nothing needed doing. He went to bed with the luxury of everything he has earned being unremarkable and slept, while the town exchanged its gossip with the gulls, the oven cooled like an animal folding itself up, and the choir, satisfied with the state of its vigil, stopped singing for the night and let air finish the last verse by itself.
