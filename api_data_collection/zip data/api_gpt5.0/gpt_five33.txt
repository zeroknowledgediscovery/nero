The first thing he heard each morning was the droning of HVAC units humming over the strip mall opposite his townhouse. It was like the earth clearing its throat. Then the pigeons on the streetlights, softly clucking as if they had discovered a gossip column about the weather. Alessandro lay in the gray breath before sunrise, counting the intervals the units clicked on and off. He liked how the numbers fell into place — three longs, a pause, a short — and turned them into a story no one but him would ever hear.

He had a ritual. He had many rituals, actually, he would admit to no one. On the fridge there was a list in blocky blue pen, faded from time: eggs on Wednesday, black beans on Saturday, one espresso and half a glass of water before leaving, check the stove twice, turn the deadbolt left until it clacks, never right because the lock will sulk and stick. He put on the same gray sweater most fall mornings, a neutral color so the day could write on him. He rechecked his bag three times. He told himself it was efficient. He told himself he would someday be different, looser, barefoot on a beach somewhere, laughing without checking his watch. That someday never came. He didn't mind.

Outside, Richmond Hill yawned. The sidewalk swallowed the halos of streetlights with a damp appetite. Across the way, the windows of the nail salon were dark, the pink cursive neon asleep. His neighbor’s porch light glowed milk-white. He had seen it a thousand times. He had never been invited under it.

Later he would tell himself it had always been about light.

He drove down Yonge Street through the drizzle, wipers muttering. The town slid by: the baker with trays glittering in the pre-dawn, Park Lane with its promise of evergreens on sale, a man in a fluorescent jacket pushing a shopping cart with a stubborn wheel that chirruped against the curb. He felt the warm pull of certain landmarks in his chest: the turn for Major Mackenzie he never took, the used bookstore that was closed on Mondays but smelled like old tea even from the sidewalk, the square, the old theatres with their names like grandparents. He knew the sequence of traffic lights as if they were measures in a song. Green, red, red, green. The morning opened in fours.

At the office, the lobby smelled faintly of lemon cleaner and stale coffee. He exchanged nods with the security guard everyone called Mr. Wayne, who wore a tie patterned with tiny maple leaves. Wayne’s blooming grin made Alessandro feel seen and not entirely ready to be seen.

“Morning, Ale,” Wayne said, and then, in his favorite joke, “Account for yourself.”

“I’ve got receipts,” Alessandro replied. He always said the same thing. It was part of the ritual.

He sat at his desk by the window that looked down at a strip of colorless lawn and a service road where trucks reversed with a peeping that made his jaw twitch. He laid out his day in a grid: numbers lined up like kids waiting for recess. Spreadsheets calmed him. The scroll of transactions, the neat logic of debits and credits, the way a thing could be wild at 9 a.m. and obedient by lunch — it was close to magic. He lost hours here, like socks.

At ten, Karan leaned over the partition, holding a napkin with something wrapped inside that smelled like cumin and warmed sun.

“I brought samosas,” Karan announced. “My wife made them last night, too many, and she said, take them to your friend with the melancholy eyebrows.”

“I do not have melancholy eyebrows,” Alessandro said, then felt them lifting mournfully toward his hairline, the way plants stretch toward a window.

“You absolutely do,” Karan said. “Eat. I need you to live long enough to explain withholding tax to me again.”

They ate perched on the corner of Alessandro’s desk, careful not to oil the files. Karan told him a story about his daughter’s grade two teacher, who kept a pet snail in a glass tank and had named it Sir Hasty, as if naming could undo what a snail was. Alessandro laughed until he coughed, and when he wiped his eyes, he saw his reflection in the black monitor: flushed, a little handsome, devoured by numbers.

At lunch, he walked three blocks to the small park with two stunted spruces that never seemed to grow or die. He ate an apple and fed crumbs to a sparrow who was bold enough to jump onto his shoe. He watched a woman across the path sketching in a notebook, her hand moving like a promise. He wished he were someone who could sketch. He counted the ways he could not. He made a list: wrists too stiff, no sense for shading, fear of the blank page. His mother used to tell him, when he was a child who sorted his Legos by color, that comfort was a tidy box you could rearrange forever. But sometimes, she would say, sometimes you have to pull out the bright mess and walk around in it.

It’s not that he was lonely, he told himself. It’s that he liked the shape of his thoughts when they were alone with him.

In the evening, after the printer refused to print for the third time and the office fell into that tired laugh it reserved for small mechanical betrayals, Alessandro drove home through the good kind of dusk — the one that turns everything into a soft confession. The porch lights were coming on, one by one, across the row of townhouses like a zipper. He parked and heard the scrape of a garage door further down, the sharp bark of a dog with too much heart, the hum of a television laugh track, the world wound up and ready.

As he reached his stoop, he saw her for the first time properly. She was on her knees on the porch next door, coaxing soil into a terracotta pot. Her hair was up and escaping. There was a smudge of dirt on her cheek that looked like a thumbprint. Three native grasses in their plastic sleeves leaned precariously on the steps like shy visitors. The fan of her hands was quick and dexterous, like a pianist’s. He had seen her in glances before, had registered the prime facts — new neighbor, small car with a roof rack, late-night porch light, boxes — but the brain, it turns out, hoards its lightning.

“Evening,” he said, because he could not bear not saying anything.

She looked up, surprised, but not startled. Her face opened like a window. “Hi,” she said. Her voice was low, an alto river. “Do you know if this spot gets morning sun? I’m trying to figure this out, and I have a map, but maps lie, don’t they?”

He tried to remember the path of light on the stoops in June. He had a spreadsheet in his head for that too. He had watched shadows as he drank his espresso on the step, counted their creeping with a pleasant scold. “You’ll get about an hour, maybe two, before Mrs. Delaney’s sugar maple throws a temper tantrum.”

“That’s valuable to know,” she said, and smiled. “I’m Mira.” She wiped her hands on her jeans and held one out, bare, thumb ridged with soil. He took it like it was something fragile he had to sign for.

“Alessandro,” he said, and then, because he always surprised himself by tipping too much suddenly, “I like maps.”

“Me too,” she said. “I love when they surprise you. I’m a landscape designer. It’s all maps and arguing with sunlight. And rabbits. Mostly rabbits, eating the things I think the sun and I have agreed upon.”

“Rabbits,” he said, as if that were the name of a god.

She laughed. “You’ll see. They lurk. They chew the authority out of you.”

They talked about sun and soils. He admitted his basil always died in July. She told him his pot was too shallow, that roots needed room to make their arguments. He listened as if each detail were a clue to a larger code. She told him she had moved from Guelph, grew up near the Speed River, missed the sound of water that didn’t come from a faucet. He told her he grew up in Maple, really, but said Richmond Hill so people could place him, said his mother still lived in the original house with its brick like faded lipstick, said she was good, really, if a little worried about him living alone at his age, a little church on the stained-glass side.

“She sends me lasagna sometimes,” he added, and because he could, he imitated his mother’s accent, a soft Southern Italian anchoring of vowels. Mira laughed, the neighbor beyond them shut a window.

“You’ll need to tell me your mother’s lasagna secrets,” Mira said. “I have an oven but I’ve never cooked anything in it that takes more than twelve minutes.”

“She will insist on telling you in person,” he said. “And also will insist you do not know what to do with garlic.”

“Oh no,” Mira said. “I very much know what to do with garlic. But I’m willing to be corrected.”

They were still there when the light revealed the blue in itself, when the mailman’s last walk at the end of the line became the crunch of footfall that was a kind of lullaby. He went inside feeling like he had put down something heavy he had carried so long he had forgotten it was on his back.

The next morning he found himself inventing reasons to be outside. He tuned the little bicycle bell on his long-forgotten bike, oiled the chain, leaned it back against the fence grinning. He swept his steps though there was nothing on them but wind. Eventually Mira came out in a white T-shirt with a pocket and shorts, her hair a tangle he felt he had seen in a painting. She set her coffee down and checked the pots with a focus that made him want to be a pot. She knelt and pressed soil around the stems.

“Today,” she said, without looking at him, “I take on the front bed. The previous owners had plastic tulips in there. They were very committed to the idea.”

“I… remember,” he said, because he had seen those tulips glint in February with the shamelessness only plastic can possess. “Can I help?”

She looked over. Considered him. “Do you own a shovel?”

“Yes,” he lied, and then went to the garage and stared at the slender garden spade leaning behind the rakes as if it had been there just for him to find.

They pulled, they dug, they laughed when the roots of the fake tulips revealed themselves as pegs that clutched the soil like small fists. They found a piece of blue glass that had been worn to a river softness, a coin so tarnished their faces could not quite see their faces in it, a child’s marble the color of a robin’s egg. He liked that they were excavating someone else’s decisions together. It felt illicit. It felt like a sacrament.

“My mother will be thrilled if she sees me doing manual labor,” Alessandro said. “She will think it means I am becoming a man.”

“Did she think you weren’t one already?” Mira asked, in that way she had of making a question not a trap but a bench you could sit on.

“She thinks I am an accountant. Those are not, to hear her tell it, the same thing.”

“What are you, then, apart from that?” she asked.

He stopped. The soil was dark under his nails. A worm startled him by being worm-like. “Someone who walks,” he said, surprised to hear it.

“That’s something,” she said. “Where do you go?”

“Nowhere special. Around. The streets from Elgin Mills to Major Mackenzie. The long white noise of Yonge. Mill Pond when I want to pretend I am in a postcard. Sometimes I count the streetlights between lights. Sometimes I imagine the houses’ lives.”

“I grew up naming the trees on my street,” she said, “so that must be the same thing. The map of your feet. I’ll come with you sometime.”

He turned and had to look away, as if the sun had flared through the maple at a teamster's stubborn angle. He nodded, and said something cool like, “Okay,” and then turned over a patch of weeds with more enthusiasm than weeds deserve.

A week unwound itself. He saw her in the mornings, the evenings, passing like a rumor. They made the porch a place of sentences. Her work, she said, was with a small firm that designed spaces for schools and clinics — places for small bodies to feel their smallness as strength. She cared about native species, pollinators, about water moving the way water wants to move. She cared about the way children discover gentleness when they put a seed in dirt and watch it struggle and then arrive. He said he admired the word we. He said he had always liked the sound of intent.

“You always sound like you’re correcting a ledger,” she told him, teasing, rolling a small stone between her fingers. “You want everything to be even.”

“Doesn’t everyone?” he asked, and she told him no, some people want to fly, and some people want to dig, and some people only want to look at the sky and say its name properly.

“Blue,” he said.

“Don’t do that,” she murmured, smiling. “Come to the coffee shop later. Around eight?”

He was late. He made himself five minutes late because it seemed like something people did. As he walked, he counted to slow himself, then felt silly and stopped counting and then counted how many times he had decided to stop counting, which was three. The coffee shop, with its mural of a fox in a scarf reading a book, was half full. A kid in a stroller was crying inconsolably into a wad of napkins. Mira sat by the window, watching the round-mouthed kid with a face that was equal parts amused and worried. She looked at him and then out the window and then back at him, and he felt something in him pack its bags as if it were moving house.

“Hi,” she said. “I ordered you a cappuccino because you feel like a cappuccino person. If I am wrong, we can become enemies.”

“You are not wrong,” he said. “And I’m not ready to be your enemy.”

They talked until the barista, a tall woman with hair the color of sugar gone too far, began to stack chairs with a sigh. They left into a night that was pretending to be chillier than it was. They walked toward Mill Pond and watched the geese on the water like punctuation marks. She told him about a professor she adored who had taught them to stand at the edge of a field and wait, and how patience is not waiting but paying attention as the waiting changes shape. He told her about a client who had hidden a small fortune in coins inside a set of encyclopedias because he didn’t trust the banks, and how, when it came to light, the man had stood in the storeroom with tears in his eyes and said he’d always wanted to hear the sound of money moving like a river.

“What did it sound like?” she asked, fascinated.

“Like pennies,” he said, and made a face he didn’t expect and they both laughed.

He became greedy. There is no other word. He wanted more of the particular angle her shoulders took when she was concentrating on a thing, the way she tested a fact by turning it over in her mouth like candy, the sudden blaze of her annoyance at a poorly designed curb cut, the softness in her voice when she said hello to old women on the street as if they were rare books she was reading tenderly. He wrote down phrases she used in a notebook, as if collecting them could ensure there would be more. He began to tell Karan stories, small ones, with a tone he could not control.

“Ah,” Karan said, after the third day of this, “the eyebrows are now romantic. It is a new era.”

“Shut up,” Alessandro said, but he smiled badly and everyone in the office noticed and had the grace, mostly, not to say so.

At night he called his mother. Her voice was a table set for a feast. “Are you eating? Are you sleeping? Do you remember you are my only son and therefore my only chance at grandchildren?” He rolled his eyes and smiled, because this was the dance, because each time he felt both scolded and blessed.

“I met someone,” he said, how he did not know. The words leaped without permission.

“You what?” she said. The sound of pots in the background changed timbre. He could see her, wiping her hands, sitting down with the seriousness of theater.

“I met someone. She’s my neighbor. She’s—” He looked at the ceiling, at the white roughness where a previous owner had patched a crack like a poorly mended wound. “She’s not like anyone I know.”

“What is her name?”

“Mira.”

“Do you love her?” his mother asked, not kindly, not cruelly, like a midwife, like a stopwatch.

“I don’t know her,” he said, which is another way of saying yes but I am still on the first page.

“Then go and know,” she said, returning to her pots, to the orchestra of her stovetop. “The world is not patient, Ale. It does not wait for you to walk to it. Sometimes you can run. Sometimes you should.”

He did not run. He walked, but he amended the pace. He found himself practicing being brave in small ways, like leaving a message when she didn’t answer instead of not leaving one and then pretending he had meant not to. He bought flowers, then put them in a jar in his kitchen and laughed because they were ridiculous there, bright and wrong, as if color were trying to bribe the room into not being beige.

He learned her cadence. She worked early some mornings and late some nights. She ate toast in her car. She bought milk and forgot it on the counter and had to run back from the shower because she smelled it turning. She hummed when she was designing, a piece of music that he couldn’t place and she couldn’t name, something like a lullaby with a crooked tooth. He hummed it at the office and Karan asked him if he was okay. He said he was. He was.

One Sunday they went to the farmer’s market and Mira spoke to every grower as if they were cousins. Alessandro asked quietly about beans and came away with a Benedictine lecture and a handful of free herbs a woman named Dasha insisted he would not be able to kill. They ate strawberries under the lean of a tent and Mira told him about a book she loved, and he told her about a lake he had seen once as a child, the way it had made his chest open like a window. “Maybe it was Lake Simcoe,” he said. She shrugged. “It could have been a glass of water,” she replied. “Childhood makes everything a lake.”

They stood in line for coffee and a child ahead of them turned and stared at them in that way children have of looking straight into the center of a person till the person has to pretend to retie a shoe or cough. “Are you friends?” the child asked. Mira glanced at Alessandro. Something in her face softened and reassembled itself.

“Yes,” she said. “We are.”

He walked home feeling like he had put on a coat that fit, and also discovered that his shoulders were not where he thought they were.

In the small spells of silence between then, he noticed creatures. It was as if her attention, radiating, taught him how to see more of the world with less effort. The squirrels were less random. The blue jays had choreography. He saw, for the first time with a kind of attention, the quickened bob of a rabbit in the near-empty lot behind the used furniture store. It held still, thinking its stillness would make it vanish. It did not. He stood with his bag of groceries and watched it watch him. He thought he had never seen anything so certain about being itself.

That night, on his porch, he told Mira about the rabbit. She leaned forward, lights from the street blistering and popping across her cheek like little dramas. “They’re everywhere,” she said. “Toronto, here, Davenport, Mississauga. They’ve found we make our edges sloppy. They love edges. They read our mess like a book.”

“What do we read?” he asked. He heard, later, the grandness in the question. At the time it felt small, something to toss across like a coin.

She looked down at her hands. “Sometimes I think we read the wrong things on purpose. The sky says storm and we read picnic. The body says rest and we read hustle.” She smiled, quick, to defang the seriousness. “Sorry. The farmer's market always makes me philosophical. Too many pickles.”

“Pickles do that,” he said solemnly and she laughed her alto river.

After that, he saw her differently. He found himself watching for the rabbit when he crossed the lot. He found himself unable to step on a snail by accident without flinching with his whole self. He moved slower near certain hedges. He felt the city’s lights as a kind of soft invasion and loved them anyway. He walked two extra blocks to avoid a spot where a raccoon had been hit — a mess that the rain had quieted but not erased.

On a Wednesday when the sky had the color of a wet sock, Mira knocked on his door. He opened to find her holding a jar full of peonies the color of thinking about a secret. “Client gave me too many,” she said. “They don’t last. They’re like air with ideas.”

He took them and felt something in his throat change position. “Come in,” he said. “I’ll make coffee.”

Her eyes flicked past him into his small living room and he flushed, seeing it with her eyes: the beige couch with the throw that was trying too hard, the picture on the wall his aunt had given him of a boat that had no right to float, the keyboard along the wall he hadn’t played in a year. He panicked a little and loved that he panicked.

“Nice,” she said. “Orderly. You’re orderly.”

“It’s a disease,” he said, but softened the words with a tone he hoped sounded like permission. She walked in with her shoes on, then stopped and asked, “Shoes?” and he waved it off, even though he hated bitumen coming inside. He let her tread little pieces of the city into his rug.

They drank coffee and listened to rain getting ideas on the windows. She picked up the framed photo on the shelf of him and his mother at Canada’s Wonderland, both squinting at the lens as if the future were in there. She asked about a book on the table. He asked about the calluses on the inside of her thumb.

“That’s from a trowel,” she said. “Muscle memory. I can dig in my sleep.”

She sat close without touching and he felt his bones lean in as if they wanted to be in conversation too. He did not kiss her. He did not even think he could. It was enough to have her there, the room rearranging itself around her presence, the edges of his furniture softening, the flicker in the corner no longer a menace but a joke.

When she left, it was still raining. She stood on the porch, looked at the slick street, the leaves stuck like tongues to the sidewalk, and lifted her chin. “Go for a walk with me,” she said.

He did. They walked along Yonge until the lights made ladders on the wet. They did not talk much. At Major Mackenzie, a bus hissed at the corner and a teenager in a hoodie ran and made it by a thread, turning back to grin at a friend who had misjudged and was left. Alessandro felt that in his chest. He didn’t know why. They cut over and walked past a row of old houses that had once been farmhouses before the city reached up like a flood and said mine. The rain thinned to a mist and then stopped, as if embarrassed by its own enthusiasm.

“What are you on the edge of?” she asked him suddenly, not looking at him.

He thought. “A good thing,” he said. “And also the fear of it.”

“I am,” she said, “on the edge of trying to forgive things I haven’t yet figured out how to call mistakes.”

They walked a little longer. They stopped at the lot. There was the rabbit, under the bent chain-link, eyes like beads in a pocket. They stood very still. He could hear her breath approving of his.

“Hello,” she whispered.

It flicked an ear. It was not a miracle, not in the newspaper way. It was a small creature regarding two larger ones with something like suspicion and something like mild interest. Alessandro felt included. He felt responsible.

The week after, he found himself reaching for his phone in the mornings with that itch that is not an itch and is not hunger but is where they live in the body. He texted her jokes about weeds. She sent him pictures of puddles reflecting the sky, and once, a video of a snail making its brave way from one side of a sidewalk to the other while she narrated like the BBC, whispering, “Must he go? Yes he must. But slowly.”

He became protective of the time between the act of leaving the office and turning the key in the lock at home, because she might be there, on the steps, or might be inside, and the not-knowing was electric. Once, he saw a shadow in her window that looked like two people and felt a spike of something like jealousy, then discovered it was her and a lamp and laughed, then felt ashamed of his fear and its speed. He was out of practice at this. He wanted to do it well, as if there were marks.

“You can’t do it well,” Karan told him dryly over lunch, when Alessandro admitted he had written an email and then deleted it after each sentence. “You can only do it. Look at you. You want to be graded. There is no midterm. There is only mess.”

“I like the idea of a midterm,” he said, and Karan sighed dramatically and wrote on a napkin with a dull pencil: ALE: A-. CAN IMPROVE IN BEING.

“Very helpful,” Alessandro said, and stuck it in his pocket like a relic.

He and Mira were walking more now. Not far, not even fast, but on purpose. He told her the names he had for certain corners: The Theatrical Puddle, The Alley That Once Smelled Like Bananas, The Dog Fence, The Place Where You Always Hear Someone Practicing Guitar You Cannot See. She told him the names she used: The Winded Tree, The Laughing Drain, The Street That Always Lies About Being Closed. They entered each other’s lexicons as if crossing borders with a wink at customs.

One evening, with the light that too-transparent late summer light, they sat on the porch and watched the street go by. A boy on a scooter, knees white from a summer of collisions. A woman with a headscarf carrying a bag that said read more. A man biking with grocery bags swinging like pendulums, his jaw set in an equation. The rabbit appeared, quick and nibbling, by the edge of Mira’s newly planted native grasses. It nuzzled a blade, considered, took it. Mira made a little noise like human eating too.

“You can have one,” she told it. “Only one.”

“They can’t hear contracts,” Alessandro said, and she shushed him and the rabbit slowly, slowly chewed.

He wondered what it meant to fall in love. Whether it was that, these small longings, this catalog of habits, the way his heart tripped when he saw her car back into the spot and straightened with that small correction at the end that she always did. He wanted to be less stupid and more honest. He wanted to hold her hand and also to keep his hands to himself because touching seemed like saying hello too loud. He wanted to say love and he wanted to never say it because saying it would make it something he could lose.

One afternoon his mother came by with a casserole and looked around and then at him with eyes that had been practicing for years. “I met her,” she said, as if reporting a weather system. “I like her. She has hands. Good hands.”

“Hands?” he said.

“For making a thing that grows,” his mother said, fierce and soft. “She is for this world.” She shook her head in the way that meant both awe and disbelief. “Do not think so much. It is like salt. Too much, the soup is dead. Too little, it is dead. Enough,” she pinched fingers together, “enough is good.”

“I will try,” he said, which is not a promise, not a not.

He waited for the moment something would shift. He had watched enough doors to know when a hinge is about to give. They were walking their usual, late, after one of those days where nothing happens and at the end your body is tired from the secret labor of being disappointed in a small way. They got coffees at the fox mural place and talked about nothing: the shame of bad hats, the fineness of a good pen, whether a cloud looked like a ship or a ship looked like a cloud. He wanted to take her hand. He did not. He felt his hand buzzing with the absence. At the lot, the rabbit was there. Mira squatted, balanced on the heels of her sneakers. She said something soft that the rabbit didn’t hear. He watched her watch it. He understood suddenly that even if he never touched her, he would have this. He did not know then what would happen. He did not know how quickly the world could be divided into before and after, by fur and panic and the thud a body makes when it meets a stupid, human thing like rubber.

He did not know, and for that, for those days and their long, irregular music, he was grateful in advance, though he would not understand that gratitude for a long time.

He said her name then. Just that. The way people say a blessing over bread. And she looked up, surprised and lit and unafraid, and he thought: I could walk this street forever. He thought: I know the light by heart. He thought: Oh.

There was a long truck down on Yonge with a laugh like iron. Somewhere, a boy dropped a ball and it rolled toward the curb with a seriousness that made Alessandro’s chest hurt. The rabbit paused, and they did too, all three of them, and the world held its breath, deciding nothing yet, because it still could.It happened in a way that, later, he would replay as if his mind were a machine with a broken rewind button, snagging and repeating on the same frames until the film burned. The ball let go of the boy’s palm and found the slope of the curb as if gravity had hired it for a demonstration. The rabbit lifted its head, ears making a V of attention, and then, having studied human language long enough to misread our punctuation, tried for the space between the parked cars. Alessandro opened his mouth and discovered that breath could be an argument. Mira rose so fast she was a hinge letting a door slam. The truck on Yonge shifted its weight and laughed that iron laugh again, a joke too big for its audience. The rabbit’s leap was a bright idea too late. The sound, when it came, was small and indecorous. It was the sound of rubber kissing fur and announcing an intention not to marry. Alessandro felt it in the ache that lives behind the sternum, an ache inherited from when we had gills or trees, wherever the body keeps its old libraries.

For a moment after, the street behaved as if nothing had happened. The boy retrieved his ball with a seriousness that made Alessandro want to sit him down and say kind things about cause and effect and how the world can misbehave even when you don’t. The truck decamped, its laughter dwindling into the steady, world-eating complaint of traffic. Mira was already there, so fast Alessandro felt like a man in a video watching his own delay. She crouched at the ragged edge of the lot where the chain-link made a crooked border and whispered the kind of words you would whisper to a child or a pot about to crack. The rabbit was not crushed but injured, its back legs trying and trying to find a sentence, its heart so visible in the hollow behind the ribs that Alessandro thought he could press his thumb on it and give it punctuation. He did not touch. He remembered somewhere in the back room of his brain that wild things do not take comfort from hands as a rule, that stress can be a second injury more fatal than the first. But Mira, with that ferocious tenderness that had nothing to do with rules, slipped her jacket off and made a cradle that did not feel like a cage. The rabbit, in the way of creatures deciding between fight and leave, chose to close its eyes.

“What do we do?” Alessandro asked, and heard in his voice the child he had been asking his mother where rain went when it was finished.

“Wildlife centre,” she said, already, impossibly, with her phone one-handed and alive. “There’s one in the city. They have an after-hours drop. Or Dr. Singh on Highway 7, he stabilizes and then sends.” She frowned down at the screen, lips moving with numbers, directions. “You drive. I’ll hold.”

He hesitated only long enough to be ashamed. Ritual said to check the stove, to turn the deadbolt left until it clacked, to make sure the list on the fridge had not leapt off in the night and rearranged itself. This was not the night for ritual. He ran. The keys were where they always were, in the blue bowl by the door that had belonged to his grandmother and still smelled faintly of orange peel if you were insane and in love with a memory. He lifted them and felt, with a clarity that would make him laugh later, the weight of the small aluminum rabbit on the keychain a friend had given him in university. He had never much liked it. He would keep it forever now.

In the car, the rabbit lay in Mira’s lap with its body making a question Mark, the curve of it a plea. Mira held it as if not to hold it would be a confession. Alessandro drove as if the lights were orders, as if his obedience could be a bridge. The drizzle returned with the confidence of rain remembering its job. The wipers argued in the language of metronomes. He saw Mr. Wayne in his mind, saying account for yourself, and said aloud, for no one, “I’m trying.” The streets were the same streets he knew in his sleep, but they had put on a new face for the emergency, a serious older cousin’s face. Yonge elongated like a question posed to too-big a table. A police car somewhere yawned its siren and then changed its mind. They passed the late-night pizza place where boys in hats stood shoulder-to-shoulder like a choir and devoured triangles of hot salt. Mira murmured into the rabbit’s ear the kind of story one invents at the edge of a cliff, where the story is not for the listener but for the cliff.

“We should have left it,” he said, because guilt always finds the dimmest hallway and gropes for a light switch.

“We shouldn’t have left it,” she said, calmly, as if they were discussing the price of eggs in July. “It isn’t about should. It’s about doing the thing that is yours to do.” She stroked with two fingertips the space between the rabbit’s eyes, where the fur changes direction like a small wind. “Yours is driving. Mine is holding.”

The place they were looking for was set back in a small, unspectacular plaza that by day sold furniture that wanted to be liked and by night looked like a secret meeting where everyone had forgotten the password. The sign said Animal Care in the indefensible font that you pick when you are trying not to be sad. The door was a rectangle Mira shouldered open with a knee. Inside the waiting room, the lighting was the unforgiving honesty of a church basement. A woman with gray hair in a braid sat behind a counter with a composure that made Alessandro want to confess everything from lying about having a shovel to stealing a chocolate bar in 1997. There were posters on the wall in a palette of earnest blues. Do Not Feed Bread To Ducks. Do Not Try To Raise A Raccoon. There was a kettle and a stack of mismatched mugs and a sign that said Please Pay. There was the smell of antiseptic and wet fur and something else, something like a recent prayer.

“Eastern cottontail,” Mira said, and the woman nodded, as if they had spoken earlier in this life. “Back legs compromised. We don’t know—”

“We’ll see,” the woman said. Her voice had the crispness of someone who keeps her sadness triangulated so it doesn’t flood the floor. She took the jacket with its small, breathing ship and did not coo, did not dramatize, merely made the next thing happen, which is, after a disaster, the only believable magic. “There’s a drop room. After hours we stabilize and then the rehabbers take over at dawn.” She held Mira’s eyes with a tenderness that included the possibility of no good news, and it did not flinch. “You can stay. Or you can go, and we will call.” She slid across a form with boxes: Where Found. Time of Incident. Contact. She handed them a pen that had, inexplicably, tiny ducks swimming in its clear barrel in pale blue liquid. Alessandro found himself watching the ducks as he wrote, as if he could steer the liquid with his attention.

They stayed. They sat on chairs that believed in the possibility of backs. They sipped tea that tasted like an apology. In the small room behind a door that said Staff Only in a stern, motherly way, there was movement and the sound of human murmur and the kind of silence that is not empty but upright. Mira looked at her hands as if she were reading a letter written on them by a friend who only speaks through garden implements. Alessandro stared at the laminated card on the table that explained what to do if you find a bird on the ground: Look for a nest. If naked and eyes closed, a nestling. If feathered, a fledgling. The card had a small drawing of a bird with a speech bubble that said I’m okay! It made him hate the speech bubble and love the bird and hate himself for confusing those loves.

“Once,” Mira said, without looking up, “when I was ten, my father pulled the car over on the side of the road on Bishop and got out and picked up a turtle that was halfway across and carried it to the other side. We were late for something that my mother cared about and she was furious and in the car she didn’t speak for an hour. He didn’t apologize. He just said, as if to himself, ‘They do not understand the way we do.’ I wanted to be someone who did.”

“I once did arithmetic with pebbles,” Alessandro said, surprising himself. “I used to put them in rows and pretend each one had a name and a job. I thought maybe if they all had jobs they’d be less likely to disappear. I think… I think I still do that. With people. With days.”

She smiled without showing her teeth. “You give them a ledger.”

“I think I give them a story,” he said, and then felt the embarrassing largeness of it, like bringing a tuba to a picnic.

The gray-haired woman returned with careful hands. She crouched so she was at eye level in the benevolent way of humans who know you might cry. “We’ve stabilized him. It’s a juvenile male. The back end is complicated. The shock is worse. They…” She glanced at the laminated duck pen, almost smiled. “They’re made of lightning and eggshell. He’s breathing. He’s warm. That is what I can promise. He will go to the rehabber at five. We’ll call you when we know.”

Mira nodded and breathed as if someone had just told her she had permission to use her lungs again. “Thank you,” she said, which in English has to stand in for too much.

They left with the absence of the rabbit occupying a space in the car that was its own furniture. The city was very nearly one o’clock, which is a time that believes its own secrecy. The streetlights were fewer and more honest. The puddles had stopped pretending to be small and had become composeurs, reflecting lampposts like cathedral columns. They drove in the kind of quiet that is not an argument but a truce. At a red light, Mira put her hand palm up on the console as if setting down a clause. Alessandro placed his on top of it without looking, and the click in his chest was not so much love as the sound of a thing sliding into its correct slot. He did not squeeze. He did not test it. He just watched the light change and gave the car permission to move.

Sleep did not behave. He lay in bed with his eyes closed listening to the HVAC units across the strip mall clearing their throats and found himself inventing ways to make that sound benign. He decided it was the ocean, far away, training itself. He decided it was a choir practicing the same note until it forgot it was a note and became a place to stand. He counted again, without wanting to, the intervals between clicks, the way the heaters negotiated a treaty with the damp. He heard the late bus exhale on Yonge like a dragon that had given up on impressing anyone. The dawn that came was a shy thing, embarrassed to be seen arriving, and he was awake before it knew it had been caught. When the phone rang a little after six, he knew it would be the woman with the braid even before he saw the unknown number lighting up his screen like a lighthouse that had decided to text.

He listened. He said thank you. He hung up and lay back down and rested the phone on his ribcage and watched the ceiling. The rabbit had died at dawn, in the way of small, fragile bodies that fight and then decide to do what bodies have always done when the math runs out. Shock, the woman had said, as if the word were a neighbor they both knew and did not much like. He thought of the pen with the ducks. He thought of the boy with the ball. He thought of Mira’s palm under his on the console, the heat of it as persuasive as weather.

He texted her because a voice would have made the words too heavy to carry. One word, which is all that fit. Sorry. The dots appeared and disappeared, a Morse code of indecision, and then came back with a steadiness that felt like someone walking up his porch steps. I’m up. Come have coffee, if you want. He wanted. He put on the gray sweater that believed in neutral and rinsed his face with water that had the mood of a good friend. He checked the stove twice without meaning to and locked the deadbolt left until it clacked with the small satisfaction of a machine that knows it is necessary.

She had propped open her door with a ceramic frog, which was either whimsical or a threat depending on your feelings about frogs. The smell inside was that other kind of morning, the kind that belongs to kitchens with light on their shoulders. Her hair was up in a way that made him think of a dancer halfway through a rehearsal. She had put the peonies he had not managed to keep in his in a low bowl and their scent made the rooms smell like a secret that had decided to become a city. She handed him a mug and he held it with both hands like a pilgrim.

“We did what we could,” she said, because it is important to say out loud the sentences that are trying on their boots.

“I know,” he said, believing it and not believing it in equal measure, which is how most belief travels.

They sat on the couch that was not beige but brave beige. Outside, the street practiced being Saturday. The boy with the ball was not out. A woman walked by with a dog that wore its collar as if it were a medal. Mira’s bare foot tucked itself under her thigh, the arch of it a cup for grief. She looked at her hands and then at him and then at the window where the day was making itself known with the peculiar confidence of days that happen after the bad thing. “It will keep happening,” she said quietly. “Rabbits and trucks and us thinking we can make treaties with physics. It will keep happening and we will keep trying to make it not happen, and sometimes we will manage and sometimes we will not, and the world will not give us points.”

He nodded, not because he agreed but because he recognized the kind of truth she was aiming toward, the one that doesn’t want to be caught in a net. “We could put up a little fence along the lot,” he said, immediately thinking of the derision of rabbits for fences. “We could plant something thick along the edges. We could… I don’t know.” He did not say what he wanted to say, which was that he wanted to close his hands around the world’s edges and smooth them until nothing snagged.

“We’ll plant,” she said, and smiled a smile that had purpose in it like scaffolding. “We’ll plant little prairies and think like rabbits. They like cover. They like clover. We’ll give them reasons to pause before the street and maybe the pause will be enough.”

They spent the next hours in the kind of labor that knows why it is working. They drove to a nursery where the air smelled like damp and possibility and bought trays of things that had names like scherzo and sunrise, though on the labels their names were Latin, serious and old. Little bluestem. Pennsylvania sedge. Canada anemone. They bought clover in a flat that looked like hope and a package of cheap wooden stakes that promised to be as useful as bread tags in a hurricane. They knelt in the lot, which was not theirs and yet had become their evening’s assignment. They cut away the smartweed and the burdock as if pulling burrs from hair. They dug and tamped and watered until the water disappeared the way good listening disappears into a conversation. The soil gave up, in a generous mood, a spoon, a spark plug, a set of keys no car would ever claim. Alessandro found himself talking to each clump as he tucked it in, and if Mira heard, she gave no sign beyond a small, private smile.

The work hunched the day forward into afternoon. When they were done the lot looked less like a shrug and more like a plan. The edge near the chain-link wore a fringe now, a procession of small greens that said quietly let’s reconsider. They stood back with the hose like a ribbon in Mira’s hand. She tipped it so the water arced and fell and the light made itself at home in it. He had never understood people who cried at gardens. He understood, a little, now.

Karan, when he heard the story at lunchtime on Monday, held his samosa in mid-air like a judge about to weigh a delicate case. “You two,” he said, shaking his head but smiling with that long-suffering friend smile that is mostly joy in a bad disguise. “First date at a wildlife emergency room. Very on brand. What’s next, raccoon mediation? Snail arbitration?”

“Don’t,” Alessandro said, because it was easier to be teased than to be believed. He admitted, however, to himself, that he would attend a snail arbitration if invited. He imagined it would be very polite and very slow and everyone would go home feeling that something had been accomplished even if no one could say exactly what.

Mr. Wayne, when he held the lobby door open as Alessandro came in late with the smell of wet earth on his shoes, widened his eyes in a show of scandal. “Account for yourself?”

“I planted a treaty,” Alessandro said before remembering Wayne’s jokes tended to be flares, not openings. Wayne’s grin broadened anyway and he patted Alessandro on the back with the authority of a man who had decided the boy needed a pat and would not be argued with.

His mother, when he told her, made a sound that had a wooden spoon in it. “Rabbits,” she said, as if tasting the word to see if it needed more salt. “When you were little, you cried when your goldfish die and your father took you to the toilet and said we send him to the ocean and I smack your father because what is this, a ship? But you stopped crying and then later you put a rock in the bowl and told me he need a friend. You always think of the edge. It is good. It is dangerous. Both.”

“I put a rock in a bowl?” he said, trying to visualize the physics, the tiny goldfish with its glossy, stuporous face contemplating a rock as if it could be a comrade.

“You did,” she said, with that certainty she had about his childhood that made him wonder if she had hired a stenographer. “Do not put rocks where people should go. But sometimes,” and here she lowered her voice so he had to lean against the phone to hear, “sometimes when there is a hole, you fill it.”

The days after acquired a strange brightness, the brightness of a surface scrubbed too clean. He found himself walking the long way to the mailbox to pass the lot. He found himself seeing small movements with a sharpness that made them almost intolerable: the wind shouldering the grass, the long ear of a rabbit like a leaf pretending to have a job, the lazy march of a slug trailing its heavy punctuation. The boy with the ball returned to the street as if absolved. He dribbled with his mouth set and his shoulders square and the ball made that hollow city sound against the sidewalk, a sound that carries and annoys and is also someone’s joy. Alessandro watched and felt, inconveniently, everything human and unfair.

Mira went with him on his long map of a walk as she had said she would, the evening giving them permission in its soft, forgiving grammar. He showed her the alley that once smelled like bananas, which now smelled like nothing, and he felt like the host of a party where the guest of honor had missed her cue. He took her to the place where the guitar comes from the window you cannot see, and blessedly, the invisible man had chosen that hour to practice a progression that made Mira close her eyes and tilt her head and say, “He’s almost there,” which is the kindest thing that can be said about anyone’s attempt at anything. He named the intersections he’d made up names for and she laughed at The Theatrical Puddle and corrected him gently on The Laughing Drain, which, she said, was in fact The Argumentative Drain and had a lot to say about clogs. They moved through the town like people in a book where the town is also a character, where the bakery has a mouth and the bus a spine. He reached for her hand without making an announcement and she let him have it as if she had been waiting to hand him something she had been carrying too long.

“Tell me something you didn’t tell anyone,” she said as they passed the used bookstore that always closed when you suddenly remembered you needed it.

He thought. It was not the moment for confessions about teenage misdemeanors or the extent of his dependence on lists, which she already could sense. “When I was a kid,” he said, “I used to stand in front of the bathroom mirror and rehearse saying ‘Nice to meet you,’ because I couldn’t get the tone right. I thought it sounded like I didn’t mean it. I thought people would know. I still… sometimes I practice sentences.” He could feel his face flush with the misery of being seen in a way you might not want to be seen and still wanting to be seen that way.

She squeezed his hand in a pattern that felt like a code he would, if allowed, spend the rest of his life trying to solve. “I practice leaving,” she said, the words matter-of-fact as inventory. “I don’t actually do it. But I imagine it. The bag by the door. The note on the table. The click of the lock. I think it’s because we moved a lot when I was little. I think it’s to prove to my nervous system that it can be done without loss. The nervous system is an idiot. It refuses to be trained.”

He wanted to ask her what—who—she had left and why and how the bag had never been more than a rehearsal, but the question, in that moment, would have been like stepping into a fountain with your shoes on to prove a point about water. He filed it where he filed all things about her that he wanted to touch and maybe would never, the left-hand drawer of his mind labeled with a word he had not yet found, something between reverence and curiosity.

They arrived at Mill Pond just as the water remembered the sky again, imitating its early evening, an obedient child surrendering its trick. The geese had arranged themselves in a tableau that was either political or familial. A teenager threw a pebble with the care of a surgeon into the water, and the ripples multiplied like gossip until the whole pond was involved. Mira watched with an expression that made him think of blueprints, finished ones, and he felt the old itch to make the moment make sense and resisted it. They sat on a bench that had been donated by someone whose name on the plaque made Alessandro want to meet him. The name had a lonely kindness in it.

“I have a thing,” Mira said, finally, and took out her phone and showed him a picture. It was, indisputably, a snail. It made its slow declaration across a stone. The light in the image was generous with detail. “Every month, I take a picture of a snail somewhere I don't expect a snail to be. I started doing it after my professor taught us that patience is paying attention as attention changes shape. It keeps me from running with my ideas past the place where they can keep up.”

“They do not understand the way we do,” Alessandro said, thinking of her father and his turtle and the way small things keep our largeness honest.

“They understand differently,” she said, and leaned back on the bench as if giving her spine a compliment. “Sometimes I think the world is a book we forgot to learn the language of and we went around pretending we’re fluent and then got embarrassed and refused to admit it.”

He wanted to kiss her then, in the unoriginal way of people who have just discovered that their hands are full and need something to do with their mouths. He didn’t. He looked at the water doing its studying of the sky and at the sky pretending it hadn’t noticed and thought how lucky it was that reflection isn’t ownership. He touched her on the wrist, just barely, the way you touch a belief to see if it’s made of wood.

When the call came the next day from the woman with the braid, saying that they had not been able to save the rabbit and thanking them for the address where they had found him because data accumulates into guidance, they stood in the lot again in the soft tired of late afternoon. Mira measured the distance with her eyes between the sedge and the street and then widened it by half as if widening distance could once, for once, widen time. They pressed clover seeds into a patch of earth and watered them with the attention usually reserved for first stones of buildings and last stones on graves. It was not burial and it was not nothing and it was as much ceremony as the day would allow. Alessandro said the word sorry out loud this time, not to any god in particular but to the fact of consequence.

They walked back to the porch with the kind of fatigue that is not only in the muscles but the ideas. The small rituals of his evening reassembled themselves, the click of the kettle and the straightening of the coasters, but he noticed his hand on the deadbolt and, just to prove to himself that plague and grace had both come to the house and altered the furniture, he turned it right. It sulked and stuck. He laughed and turned it left till it clacked and the day slid its last bead across the abacus. Mira was on her stoop, barefoot, picking soil from under her nails with the patience of tides. The light did its best work of the day then, getting itself tangled in her hair and in the porch railings and in the glazed edge of the terracotta pots, and for a second the street forgot to be a street and tried on being a stage. He thought of the map of his feet and the map of hers and how the two, overlaying, made a geography he could believe in.

“Do you want to come to the school garden on Thursday?” she asked without preface, as if mentioning a thing she knew he already wanted. “We’re putting in beds. The grade fours are short and opinionated. There will be laughter and the wrong shoes. You can be the person who knows where to put the level. There’s probably a ledger situation for lumber that I’m ignoring.”

He said yes and felt the yes move through him like something medicinal. He pictured small hands holding trowels like oars. He pictured himself measuring and not minding when the measurement was off because a child had chosen to stand where the string wanted to be. He pictured telling his mother and her saying, good, hands, you have them. He pictured telling Karan and Karan drawing a rabbit with melancholy eyebrows in the corner of a spreadsheet and naming it Sir Hasty in honor of the snail.

They sat until the mosquitoes lobbied successfully for attention. The lot across the street, newly fringed, wore its edge like a new haircut that felt too bold and would feel right in a week. He watched for a movement there that did not come. He did not need it to. He rested his forearm on the spindles of the porch and felt their old paint remind his skin of other summers he had been too tidy to admit he wanted. The town made a sound then that he had not noticed before, a cross between settling and rehearsal, and he decided to let it exist without naming it. Mira looked over and he caught the look and kept it in his pocket with the napkin Karan had given him with ALE: A-. CAN IMPROVE IN BEING written on it. It was the kind of look people give when they have decided you are not a stranger. He was not ready to say love. He was ready to call it a slope he would be happy to walk down, a light he knew by heart. He was ready for the boy’s ball to roll exactly as far as it would last time and then stop, and for them to watch it stop, and for the world to take an ordinary breath, the kind that keeps a day going and never makes it into a story but is the entire reason there are stories at all.Chapter 4

The next morning, the machines across the strip mall forgot themselves. It took him a minute to know what was missing; he lay there in a bright quiet that made his ears search the air like hands groping for a railing. The HVAC units had surrendered the dawn to birds and tires and the wet, conversational hush of leaves. He tried to make a story without the hum and discovered that absence has its own grammar. In the unaccustomed silence he could hear his own house settling, the faint tick of metal cooling, the refrigerator's patient throat clearing, a neighbor’s cupboard door. He stared at the ceiling and found he did not want to count. He wanted, dangerously, to let the morning be unmeasured and see if it held.

He put on the gray sweater and made the coffee and, without looking, poured water into his glass until it was the right height by intuition and not the line his eye always used as a ruler. He checked the stove only once and did not apologize to the part of himself that would have liked to check twice. When he locked the door he turned the deadbolt left until it clacked and said aloud to the empty hallway, “Good enough,” and felt, for the first time, that the words might be accurate.

At the office, Wayne's tie was a parade of salmon, their little fins pushing confidently up a woven current. Wayne cocked his head at the outside world as if he had done something to make the late light beautiful and wanted to be thanked for it. “Account for yourself,” he said, all flint and friendliness, and Alessandro considered saying he was in the business of accounting for other people's selves and had only just begun to audit his own. He settled instead for raising his palms in that universal sign for I am unarmed and said he was going to a school later to build boxes for plants with children holding rulers like swords. Wayne put his hand over his heart and said, “Godspeed,” as if the boxes were boats.

The morning numbers behaved. They let him set them in rows and smooth their hair and send them out to recess with their hats on. He finished a reconciliation that had been troublesome and felt the small, disproportionate pleasure of having translated stubbornness into compliance. Karan arrived late, smelling like coriander and traffic, and dropped a paper bag on Alessandro’s desk that let off a scent like an anthem. “Two pakoras,” he said, and then added, “For bravery. Also for grease. Best friends.” When told about the plan to build garden beds, he clucked his tongue, delighted. “Children with hammers. An honest terror. Tell me everything, especially about the one child who decides measuring tape is a snake and must be subdued.”

The school was an older one with a face like a storybook, the bricks a softened red and the windows tall enough that the sky seemed like a guest in every classroom. Mira met him at the side gate pressed open by a rock that had ambitions to be more than a rock. She wore a baseball cap with a faded logo and a T-shirt that had once been white and was now a history of summers. There was dirt in the creases of her elbows and a pencil tucked behind her ear that had been sharpened to a kind of severity. A cluster of children filled the small square of asphalt where the hopscotch grid had been drawn and then redrawn so many times it had become a palimpsest. Their energy was not chaos so much as orchestral tuning; you could sense that, any moment, a baton would rise and the sound would become music.

“This is Alessandro,” she announced, and it was both introduction and invocation. “He is a numbers person who knows that straight doesn’t always mean right.” The teacher standing beside her, a woman with hair the color of pencil shavings and a dress patterned with tiny constellations, stuck out a hand and said she was Ms. Bell. Her handshake made you trust her with scissors. “We’re grateful,” she said, and turned to the children. “Friends, this is Mr. A. He will tell you why levels are not toys.”

He tried to tell them and found, within minutes, that there was no need to explain why a bubble trapped between lines should be centered when a child named Ruby, with shoelaces in exuberant rebellion, had already decided the bubble was a stubborn friend and coaxed it like a small pet. The boards were laid out on the ground like conspirators. The smell of fresh-cut pine flashed him back to a numberless room in his memory where his father sanded planks on sawhorses, radio muttering a baseball game, sawdust in little drifts like yellow weather. He caught the memory and set it down gently where it could watch without demanding anything.

The garden space had been a rectangle of soil the color of impatience. Mira unfurled twine along the places where the beds would sit and the children learned, to their complicated delight, to hold the line taut without strangling it. Someone used the hammer like a drumstick. Someone else called the cordless drill a bee and put their tongue out in concentration the way people do when they’re speaking a language they learned late and want very much to be fluent. A boy in a shirt with dinosaurs arranged in inaccurate eras asked if worms had to wear helmets. A girl with a scab on her knee as proud as a medal told him, solemnly, that her grandma talked to tomatoes and it worked, and could they talk to the screws.

They leveled and squared and then, at a certain point, unimpeachably, let it be. The beds were boxes somewhat rectangular, their corners not marching exactly to the same drum, and yet the effect made a kind of cheerful sense. Mira led a small band to fill wheelbarrows with soil and Alessandro learned again that lifting is easier when someone small is insisting they are helping. Ms. Bell kept appearing with water and Band-Aids and a patience that suggested she had been a plant in a previous life and knew something about growing despite feet. A boy announced that he had found, under a tarp, a snail the size of his thumb nail and asked, with authority, if this was Sir Hasty. Alessandro laughed with something like recognition and listened while the creature was introduced, solemnly, to each new bed like a dignitary given a tour of a town hall.

The sun did that odd October thing of being generous and noncommittal. They paused for the arithmetic of snacks, the exchange of small oranges for granola bars and earnest negotiations over the fairness of apple slices too thin. A girl asked Alessandro if he was Mira’s husband in the devastating present tense of children. He opened his mouth to pick a word and found he did not want to diminish anything with precision. Mira said, “He is my friend,” and the girl nodded as if this were sufficient, which it was and wasn’t, but for the moment it was more than enough.

They sank seeds into the beds as if tucking a row of bright ideas under a blanket. Little hands patted as if burping a baby. The labels with laminated pictures were slid into soil like declarations of intent: milkweed, yarrow, black-eyed Susan. Somebody wrote BLAK-EYED SUZAN, and Ms. Bell did not correct it, because sometimes spelling is not the point. A boy with a cowlick so determined it might have been a philosophy stood very still with a shovel and said he could feel the earth move, which of course he could, because his arms were tired and the planet insists on reminding us that it is not a stone but a slow animal. They washed tools. They lined them up. They stood back for the ceremonial Looking At The Thing We Made and Alessandro felt something in his chest let go the way a knot in a rope realizes it has been a fist for no good reason.

After, in the staff room that smelled like coffee and tape and cake from some earlier celebration, they drank water with lemon slices floating like coins. Ms. Bell told them about the history of the old maple that shadowed one corner of the yard and how the council had once wanted it gone and how the children had written letters in the handwriting particular to people who are not yet embarrassed by their own urgency. Mira listened as if the story were a book she had misplaced and was relieved to find again. Alessandro watched the way she leaned when she listened, an angle that made him think of a stem reaching toward light it trusted.

They left the school with dirt in the cuffs of their pants and that good kind of tired that makes even the ugly buildings seem honest. On the walk back to their end of Yonge, they passed the used bookstore and, for once, it was open. Inside, the air was broken tea and paper, and the man behind the counter had a beard that suggested he had once lost a bet. A cat arranged on a stack of atlases like a queen holding court moved only its eyes to watch them. Mira went straight to a shelf as if her hands knew the geography without sight. Alessandro drifted and discovered, on a tilted table, a battered book of municipal maps, the kind where streets are stubborn squiggles and cul-de-sacs are shy dead ends. A previous owner had circled corners in pencil and written in the margins in a generous, nervous script: good pears, laughing dog, avoid on Tuesdays. He bought it without bargaining because to argue with margins would be a sin.

They stopped at the fox mural coffee shop and the barista, hair like caramel taken one notch too far toward something dramatic, said, “The garden beds, I heard? Ms. Bell came in and told me you made miracles with lumber.” Mira grimaced fondly and said miracles were ambitious, and Alessandro said the bubble in the level had opinions. They carried their cups outside because inside was a chess game and a couple making up in low voices and a man reading the paper with a seriousness that would have made the news behave if the news were the kind of thing that listened. On the sidewalk, the sun found its friendly angle and they let it do what it wanted.

He told her about the maps with the pencil notes and she told him about a client who had asked her to make a path that felt like a secret without being secret, and how she had tried to explain that secrets require consent. They talked about the school, and how one child had whispered to a seed as if it were a cat, and how another had pocketed a pebble the way people pocket a token from a lottery and hope it will change the numbers. He asked her about Ms. Bell and she said teachers are sorcerers mostly underpaid, mostly accused of doing mere tricks.

In the evening, his mother called and asked if Thursday night was an acceptable time for lasagna and reminding a woman about garlic. He said yes because the word arrived before his caution did, and then he told Mira who laughed and then looked a little like a person who has realized she has signed up for a test in a language she only pretends to know. “I will fail successfully,” she said, and he wanted to tell her she would be adored simply for arriving, which was the truth and too large to carry on a weekday.

The day of lasagna became a ritual before it happened. He found himself wiping the already-wiped countertops and picking up threads from the rug that only he could see and moving the picture of the ill-advised boat two inches to the left as if that were the difference between taste and no taste. He texted Mira a picture of the key bowl with the small aluminum rabbit and captioned it, for luck, and she sent back a photo of her hand with soil lines like a map and the words, meeting your mother with clean fingernails would be dishonest. He laughed, alone in the kitchen, and felt not alone, which is one of those domestic miracles no religion has a monopoly on.

His mother arrived with a casserole that was heavier than most arguments and kissed his cheek with authority. She wore her good cardigan and earrings that chose to announce themselves and carried, in her other hand, a paper bag that contained, he was sure, either a dessert or a piece of advice crystallized into pastry. Mira knocked like a friend and stepped in as if the doorway were a stage and she was choosing to be brave. His mother took her hands the way people do when they want to weigh your intentions and then, in one unceremonious breath, said, “You do not know what to do with garlic,” which would have been rude if her eyes hadn’t been joy, and then put her bag down and began to open drawers as if she had always lived there.

They ate too much and then ate the right amount again. The lasagna was rich and persuasive and Mira said something about the silkiness of the sauce that made his mother blot her mouth with her napkin and say, with mock sternness, that silk is for blouses, sauce is for mouths. The conversation hopped in bright little arcs and landed without injury. His mother told stories about the old house in Maple, the way the sump pump had a personality and the basement furnaces had names, and Mira told stories about a client whose dog was jealous of a pergola. They spoke of the school garden and his mother said, hands, yes, you both have them, and then she stood and washed dishes with a competence that would have made an orchestra cry. Mira dried and stacked, and Alessandro, who had always hated the wet squeak of a dish towel on porcelain, did not mind one bit.

After his mother left with leftovers parceled like diplomacy, the apartment felt slightly larger and slightly more itself, a trick he did not know how to reproduce. He and Mira sat with coffee that had cooled because talking had stolen time, and he told her the story of the maps he had found in the used bookstore and how the margin notes had made him feel like he had inherited a friend’s way of seeing. She told him about the list she kept on her fridge of things she had misread and wanted to misread again: a sign that said fair notice that her mind had made into fair notice, a bus route she had believed was an invitation, a weather report she had understood as a flirtation. They laughed and then fell quiet, not because the quiet was required but because it fit.

On a Saturday, the lot’s new fringe had begun to make its particular argument with the wind. The sedge tufted like modest haircuts. The bluestem held itself with an embarrassed authority. He and Mira stood with their coffees, guardians feeling unnecessary in the best way. A rabbit nibbled three lots down and did not come near their edge, which felt like good news and also like a snub. He decided not to take it personally. The boy with the ball rolled it along the sidewalk beside them, slow, as if he had learned something about speed that week. He stopped and looked at the plants and then at Mira and Alessandro with the blank, clear permission of children and said, “Is this for the bunnies?” Mira said, “It’s for everybody,” and the boy nodded as if that were either beyond him or exactly his size.

The week that followed was a rhythm he was not afraid to love. He went to the office and found the scroll of numbers still ready to be tamed. He went home and found the porch a sentence he wanted to finish. He learned to stand in Mira’s doorway and not step in until invited, and to be invited most of the time. He learned the geography of her kitchen where the drawer with the peelers was not the drawer you would think and where a collection of seed packets lived in a bowl with a crack that looked like a coastline. He learned the names of two of her coworkers, Charmaine and Artie, when he stopped by the little firm on a day he had taken a craft of sick leave from his rituals to bring her lunch and found them arguing about whether curves are kinder than angles.

Charmaine was a person who wore her hair in a crown of braids that made Alessandro think of architecture and said hello with a precision that suggested she had inherited hello as an instrument and had practiced. Artie was a trim man in suspenders who had been young a long time and took a pen to the air as if drawing the design there would make a council approve it. They were polite and immediately useful, handing him a chair and a bottle of seltzer as if what he had to say would need carbonation. Mira introduced him as “my neighbor who has opinions about traffic and rabbits” and they nodded gravely, as if he were in fact a consultant on a retainer with the city.

There were moments he did not handle well. One evening her phone buzzed and the name on the screen, visible for a second in the sideways light, made his stomach decide it was a small boat in heavy weather. He felt his face misbehave and went silent and then, after she sent a reply and set the phone carefully face down on the table as if tamping down a campfire, he found himself arranging the cutlery as if the arrangement could cure whatever ancient or recent thing had just made noise in the next room of her life. She looked at him with a preparedness he recognized and said, because they were not yet ready to be brave in every dimension, “Old friend,” and he nodded because nodding was kind and also because he wanted to practice not needing to have everything defined and framed and labeled with acid-free archival tape.

They kept walking. The alley that had once smelled like bananas smelled, improbably, like toast one morning, and they laughed and tried to locate the source and failed and accepted that some mysteries are benevolent and leave no forwarding address. The invisible guitarist switched from blues to something with more sunlight in it and Mira made a face that suggested a missed chord and said, “He’s changing teachers,” with the confidence of someone who reads cities like sheet music. They stood once under rain that had decided against falling and felt their hair lift minutely and looked at each other in that spooked delight that is as close to running through a field as adulthood usually dares.

He found a way to make offerings. He bought a small level shaped like a torpedo and painted the ends with nail polish so it would not disappear into a bag of grown-up toys and gave it to Mira with a card that said, bubble consultant, and she laughed the way people laugh when they’re relieved to be known slightly better than they were before. She left, on his doormat, a packet of clover seeds and a drawing of a rabbit that carried a tiny backpack and a very official expression, and in the backpack she had written tiny words that only revealed themselves if you squinted: snacks, maps, courage.

Sundays got rounder. He went to his mother's house and sat in the kitchen that always felt like a ship and let himself be handed plums and advice and laundry that had decided to stay longer than it should. His mother asked about Mira and he tried to answer in ways that did not hurt the progress by naming it too tightly. He noticed, in the yard, that his mother had planted basil in a pot that was absurdly deep, the kind one reserves for trees, and he laughed out loud and then had to explain, and she sniffed and said, “Roots need room to make their arguments,” as if she had invited Mira into her mouth to deliver the line on cue.

Back at the lot, the clover showed itself surprisingly quickly, soft ears of green that made the dirt look like it had decided to do something with its life. He and Mira knelt and put their faces near the newness and did not talk for a long time, which is a kind of talking. He could feel in his knees the information that he was not ten anymore and did not resent it, which was new. When a rabbit came—lightly, as if to pretend a visit was an accident—and paused at the fringe before the chain-link and stood with its nose processing the world in brilliant, invisible data, it seemed to Alessandro that the small pause contained a year of weather. The creature slipped back into the weeds because it had chosen this time not to test the street, and the relief that graced his body was out of proportion and exactly proportional at once.

It rained the next day and the day after that, that steady rain that makes time uniform. He sat at his desk and the peep-peep-peep of trucks backing up made his molars sing and he imagined, for a salvageable second, that he could subdivide the peeps into useful units. Karan threw a paper clip at him and said, “Stop being a human abacus. Come to lunch,” and he went and they talked about absolutely nothing important—hats again, and the fate of small umbrellas, and the one time Karan had mistaken a tax code for a poem and had a better day for it—because the body sometimes needs to rest from meaning.

The fox mural coffee shop put up a sign for an open mic poetry night and Mira, reading it, made the face of a person who loves poems and hates microphones. He asked her if she had ever read into one and she said yes, once, in university, a poem about a creek that had felt like the opposite of creek and a room full of people who were waiting for the next person, and how afterward her hands had shaken in a way that made her remember how animal the body is about speaking aloud. He told her that when he was twelve he had had to stand and read a paragraph about Confederation and had mispronounced the word and felt the heat of another boy’s laughter like a sunburn. He had practiced saying Confederation in the bathroom mirror for a month after that and, foolishly, still wanted his teacher from that year to call him at home and say, “You got it right.”

On a late afternoon that had the color of a bruise healing, they went to the pond and a heron landed in that mechanical way herons have, as if lowering itself were engineering rather than grace. They stood and watched it watch fish and the air around them did that thing where it collapses distance and lets the near and the far trade places. Mira told him she had a dream in which she walked through a field of lamps and each lamp turned on as she passed and none of them were plugged into anything and she woke laughing, and he told her he had a dream in which he opened his mouth and a coil of measuring tape unspooled in bright yellow and everyone clapped as if he had finally told the truth.

Later, on her porch, where the terracotta pots now had chips that looked like continents and a spider had made a small, ambitious geometry in the upper right corner that neither of them would disturb, he told her about the book with the pencil margins and the circled corner that said good pears. They went to find it because sometimes an errand to honor a stranger’s certainty is the only honest use of an evening. The pears, when they found them at a little market that still used a scale you could read if you squinted, were firm and smelled like the idea of sweetness rather than the announcement, and they bought four and the woman at the till nodded as if recognizing pilgrims.

They ate the pears leaning against her counter. The first bite surprised him by tasting like stone at the edges and then water in the middle, which made no sense and also made so much sense he did not want to fuss with language. He told her that when he was eight he had hidden coins behind the breadbox and then forgot them and found them months later and believed for an afternoon, with an intensity that made him tender to himself even now, that the house had rewarded him for something he had done without knowing. She told him that sometimes she forgot a bulb and found it in a drawer in July and planted it the way one might put a letter into a postbox after the birthday and decide to trust the recipient to know it was written on time.

His mother started sending him photos of rabbits she saw on her street as if they had become a family project, each rabbit a cousin to be noted and praised. Karan began leaving on his desk, once a week, a doodle of Sir Hasty in a new context—Sir Hasty on a bicycle, Sir Hasty conducting an orchestra, Sir Hasty filing a return—with captions that made Alessandro laugh with a ridiculous relief that he had friends. Wayne started taking longer to hand him his visitor pass each morning because Wayne had, without saying it, tabulated something in his head and decided the boy required more time for smiling.

On a Wednesday when the light was thin and steady and the street had made up its mind to be ordinary, he and Mira sat on the porch steps and the air smelled like someone had opened a book and the book had turned out to be about grass. He asked her, careful and not careful, what she practiced leaving. She looked at the street, which behaved itself, and said that sometimes she packed the bag just to un-pack it, that the zipper’s sound made a place in her nervous system lie down like a good dog. She told him she had left a man once, a good man who had been good at being a man and not at being beside her, and that she had discovered the words good and right are often in different rooms of the same house. He listened and did not try to be furniture and did not try to be air. He listened the way one holds a fragile thing with hands that have learned how to be soft on purpose.

When he went to bed that night, the HVAC units had returned to their congregational hum and he felt—this was new—tender toward the noise. It was not the ocean and it was not a choir, it was a herd of machines doing what machines do to make human life possible and, as with all herds, sometimes one bleated out of tune. He counted without numbers, each click a small bead on a string that led, this time, not to sleep, but to the sense that sleep was nearby in the room and would come sit on the edge of the bed and forgive him for what he had not done perfectly that day. He thought of the lot with its whispered fringe and of the school beds full of seeds and of the boy with the ball and the heron and the pen with ducks swimming in pale blue liquid and of his mother saying enough is good. He thought of the word light and how it means both weight and illumination and how, if you are lucky, you get both kinds on the same day and you are permitted to call that day yours without being accused of greed. He turned the deadbolt left until it clacked and slept in a paragraph that was not a single sentence and woke up ready to make a list and also, if necessary, ready to lose it.Chapter 6

By the time the maples flamed and let go, the mornings acquired the crispness of paper that has been folded and unfolded until its creases make their own decisions. The HVAC units across the strip mall still cleared their throats, but cold made their voices cleaner, a brighter engine hum that felt like punctuation rather than a sermon. Alessandro lay in the quilted quiet, the kind that makes sounds travel further inside you, and realized his counting had become seasonal, the way people’s handwriting changes with the month. He thought about how the lot’s fringe at the chain-link had yellowed in places, how the sedge bowed politely, how the clover made a low, stubborn green that ignored announcements. He told himself that it was a good thing to watch a plan go to seed and still feel affection for it, and he tried to picture the rabbits reading the weather and adjusting their routes the way you learn to avoid a street that always lies about being closed.

The invitation to see Mira at work arrived folded into an apology from a contractor. A clinic wanted its courtyard to stop being a recess for cigarette butts and start being a place where someone waiting for news could be seduced into breathing without watching the door. He took the morning off and met her in a space that had, until then, belonged only to wheelie bins and the backs of things that resent having backs. The building rose around them like a polite fortress; the sky was a narrow postcard between brick shoulders. Mira stood in a hard hat and talked to a man named Ivo about the curve of a path that she insisted must be a curve and not a compromise, because curves made the body forgive itself. Ivo, who had the weary good humor of those who lift, nodded, then shook his head, made a phone call, measured the distance between his thumb and forefinger and declared it twenty-two inches, and Mira smiled and showed him twenty-four inches with her hands as if sculpting air. Alessandro watched the choreography and felt awe that a human could walk into an emptiness and talk it out of being an emptiness. He carried pallets of brick with a competence that surprised him, tried not to swallow the grit blowing up in a friendly way, and learned the rhythm of answering questions he did not quite understand with, “Let me find Mira.”

At lunch they sat on upturned buckets under a false sumac that had decided to become extravagant without asking permission and ate sandwiches that mimicked their hands. Mira drew with her finger in the dust the way a river might correct a map, explaining the way benches angled toward each other make conversation possible for people who do not know they are allowed to talk, how a water rill that makes noise on purpose can drown out bad news for one minute at a time, how dead straight lines can be a kindness when someone is learning how to walk again. He chewed and nodded and felt something click, another internal slot engaging, this time a respect for the practical magic of slowing people down with plants and light and weather they already own. When a nurse passed through the courtyard on an errand and paused without admitting she was pausing, when a man in a paper mask looked up at the sky and remembered there was a sky and made his face less defensive, he stored the moments like coins in a drawer he had promised to count someday and knew he would never count.

At the fox mural coffee shop, there was a poster that announced, without blushing, a Thursday open mic. Mira read it and made the agreeable face of a person who will go for the poems and endure the microphones. He watched her reading the schedule and the sign-up sheet and pretended to be casual when he said, “Would you read?” and she said, “I might,” with a tone that meant, I will be ruined if I do and I will be ruined if I do not. He put his name down three lines below hers with the quiet terror of a man who understands that fear leaves bruises only on the inside and that sometimes bruises need air. He had not read aloud since Confederation, since the small apocalypse of an eleven-year-old’s tongue betraying him, and later, in his kitchen, he stood in front of the ill-advised boat and practiced saying a poem’s first line until it stopped sounding like he was impersonating a human.

The night of the open mic had the sonic texture of snow before snow, though no snow fell. The chairs were uncertain and too close, the small stage a rectangle of bravery, the microphone stand a lopsided sentinel that looked like it had once been a coat rack. A teenager with anxiety and a velvet voice read three lines about a train leaving slow enough to change her mind and did not change it. A man with a tattoo of a carp on his forearm read something that wanted to be a joke and was perhaps more important than a joke. The barista with caramel hair read a poem about the exact color of the hour after a storm and Alessandro, trying to be a person who listened properly, could not help thinking of the ways spreadsheets had their own colors and how sometimes he had spent a whole afternoon convincing a number to be honest. When Mira stood, she did not fuss with the microphone as much as he expected. She read about a snail on a brick wall after rain, about the way attention has muscles that you can pull if you try to lift too much too quickly, about her father’s turtle and the apology in a hand placed under a shell. Her voice did that thing it does, the alto river making its own banks, and he felt the room’s nerves align to the piece of air in front of her mouth as if it were listening to something that would, later, become an instruction. He went third after her and felt, with his bones, why poets go first or last.

He read about traffic lights and the order they made of his morning, about Mr. Wayne saying account for yourself and meaning please say you’re okay, about the rabbit and the small kiss of rubber and fur and the treaty they planted afterward. He kept waiting to be exposed as a numbers man cosplaying a feeling, and when his voice shook he let it, because fixing a voice requires tools he did not have in his bag. His mother sat in the back row with her purse on her lap like a sleeping small animal and cried with the self-control of a person who respects other people’s performances. Karan stood against the wall and made the eyebrows that meant You will never live this down and also that he had already memorized a line to use against Alessandro at lunch in a way that would feel like being loved. After, in the burble of compliments that people give strangers for telling the truth near a mic, his mother hugged him too long and said, approving and appalled, “You say Confederation correctly now,” and Mira took his hand under the table, unannounced, and squeezed once, hard, as if lifting a latch.

The name that had lit Mira’s phone in the sideways light turned out to belong to a not-quite-ex, the kind of person you do not know how to name because their representativeness outweighs their particulars. He had moved to Vancouver and found himself begging the ocean for a do-over, and she had been making a practice of not answering. On a Wednesday she handed Alessandro her phone and said, “Read it,” because sometimes the kindness is in not making the person you love narrate aloud the things that hurt them. The words were a softness weaponized: I miss your hands in dirt, I miss the way you make rooms feel like truths, I am near mountains and it is not enough. He handed the phone back and felt a responsible, adult wish to be measured and a less responsible, deeply human wish to throw someone’s phone into Lake Ontario and watch it sink like a lesson. They sat with it, the old friend who was also a shaking door, and did what people with different relationships to leaving do: she packed a bag in her mind and put it down, he made a list of reasons to stay and folded the paper slowly as if to crease the words into permanence. She told him that sometimes reaching for an old hurt was muscle memory, not desire, and he told her that sometimes his hand went to the stove twice because his wrist needed to hear the click, not because the gas needed instruction. They ate pears the color of good decisions and called that their work for the evening.

The blackout arrived on a Thursday with the performative drama of a toddler. The strip mall dimmed in a staggered politeness, the HVAC units sighed like old men, the traffic signals went immediately to confusion and then resigned themselves to flashing yellow, which is a philosophical position. Alessandro was at his desk when the computer made its small death noise and the peeping of the reversing trucks faded to a kind of full-bodied quiet he had not realized he craved and thought would hate. Mr. Wayne appeared at the office door with his tie, today a parade of oranges that had lost their peel, shining in the hallway like a cautionary tale. “Generators will take a minute,” Wayne said, and then, unable to resist himself, “Account for yourself,” and Alessandro held up empty hands that felt less empty than most days and said, “I can do nothing.” He meant it as a complaint and discovered that it was a freedom.

The city, unamplified, took a breath you could hear. He drove home through intersections where humanity attempted choreography without a conductor, smiled at the sight of strangers trading gestures that negotiated right-of-way as if bargaining for a slice of cake. The fox mural coffee shop had propped the door open like a mouth and lit candles and was handing out iced coffee like illicit medicine. The used bookstore had pulled the metal grate down halfway and the cat sat behind it with the majestic confidence of beings who own their own light. He found Mira on the steps, a candle in a jar by her foot, her face practicing being a stranger to electricity and not minding. They looked at each other in an unchallenged light and laughed in relief at the absence of a hundred hums that had always insisted on their importance.

They made a small domestic inventory of improvisations. He gifted a set of batteries that had been waiting for an earthquake, which in Richmond Hill takes the shape of forgetting directions to someone’s house. She unearthed matches that smelled like old churches and used two to light the three because starting things badly is a superstition she refuses to obey. He carried his grandmother’s blue bowl to the porch and it became a holder of wax drips, the flicker making their stoop a stage for neighbors to admire and emulate. Mrs. Delaney, sugar maple general and benevolent gossip, came out with a flashlight and a complaint that held hands with delight, and Alessandro’s mother called to ask in a voice that made weather sound responsible if he had candles and bread and whether she should defrost the freezer because what is the point of keeping things cold for no reason. He told her to keep the doors closed and imagine the fridge as an animal that likes its own dark, and she laughed and told him to stop making metaphors for appliances.

The sky, freed from its urban glare dress rehearsal, tried on a different costume and did not exactly become rural, but it did remember being something different. The stars were not vibrant, but they were present, small insistent freckles, and he found Mira touching his shoulder and then pointing as if a constellation needed his permission. On Yonge, people had come out of their corners and were saying names of stars incorrectly and correctly and without embarrassment, and a man with a portable speaker that had defied the outage by hoarding battery played a song that tried not to be too literal about darkness and light and failed charmingly. They walked in a street that had changed its mind about how fast it wanted its people to be, and someone stood at a crosswalk with a reflective vest and pretended to be authority and was.

At the lot, the chain-link made a shadow that looked like graph paper, and the new fringe made a blur of dark that he found he trusted. A rabbit appeared, then another, their bodies small parentheses, and sniffed the air like readers considering tone. The pause before the street extended like a sentence that had learned its clause. Mira’s hand found his and the silence between their palms felt as articulate as anything either of them had read into a microphone. He wanted to promise the rabbits things he had no right to promise and, uselessly and truthfully, he apologized again. The blackout made everything less tall. The factories hummed away their boredom out of town, the high-rise windows made patchwork declarations, and on the porches people poured soup into thermoses and shared it in the way crises permit and should be embarrassing after but usually are not.

He burned his finger stupidly on the nub of a candle because heroism is mostly not paying attention to inches. He hissed and shook his hand and felt ridiculous, and Mira took his hand and put his finger in her mouth for a second, a childish, mammal trick that nonetheless sent a message to the nerves that they were not alone. He stood very still not because of the pain but because of the conviction moving through him that you can be gentle and still burn and that, sometimes, people lick burns not because saliva cures anything but because attention sometimes does. They ran a bowl with an inch of water from the tap before the pressure died, which felt like beating a system that was not trying to beat them, and stuck his finger in it and sat on the steps and told the kind of stories you tell when lights pretend they will never return and you are permitted to be silly about small griefs.

When the power returned at two in the morning with the graceless enthusiasm of a parade, appliances clearing their throats and clocks flashing their temporal confusion, he lay awake and thought of the small quadrants of his life that had been revealed by the dark. He thought of Wayne’s tie, of Karan’s eyebrows practiced into new shapes, of Ms. Bell’s children with their careful patting, of the cat behind the grate with a kingdom’s dignity. He thought of the contractor measuring air with his fingers and of Mira’s insistence that the path be curved and how he had not always understood that a line can boss you around. He thought of his mother’s perfume in a room with lasagna and a woman who would not be intimidated by garlic, and of the sound a candle makes if you listen for it, which is to say none but also everything.

The morning after the blackout behaved differently, if only because the devices glowed smugly as they waited for him to reassure them about their correctness. He went to the office and found, on his desk, a doodle from Karan of Sir Hasty holding a flashlight and looking unimpressed. He found an email from the clinic with a photo of the courtyard mid-build lit by headlamps, and Mira, a smudge and a pillar, laughing behind her mask at something Ivo had said about the stubbornness of water. He found a postcard in the mail with a drawing of a mountain and a note from Vancouver that had the inarguable right to be beautiful, and he did what is best to do with mountains from far away: he admired them and did not pretend they were hills he had to climb. He turned off the email and walked to the used bookstore because sometimes gratitude needs a small errand.

The man with the beard and unstated bet had put out a new stack of atlases with names in fonts that belonged to countries that had renamed themselves. The cat lay on a Russian river and did not apologize. Alessandro found, in a bin under the table, a book with a split spine called The Human Habitat that was neither scientific nor particularly true but which had in its margins a weather system of notes in a careful, quick hand. The former owner had written, next to a photograph of a plaza from 1976, the words: people sit where the light convinces them they can be seen and not seen. He carried it to the counter and the bearded man nodded as if confirming the choice rather than permitting it, and Alessandro left with the satisfaction of having acquired a sentence he would live with for a long time.

He took the sentence to Mira and she read it and put the book to her forehead in the way of some old cultures that had the better idea and then opened it and said, “Let’s make a room on a sidewalk,” as if that were a reasonable task for a Saturday. They moved a small table from her place to the stoop and set it with a cheap tablecloth that made confidence out of cheap, and put two chairs there and a bowl of pears like an invitation, and within an hour three neighbors had stopped as if intercepted by fate, two had told stories about the month in which the street flooded and how the mayor had been useless, one had asked if they wanted to borrow a better tablecloth and had been gently refused because better would have been worse. The porch had been a sentence for months and now it was a paragraph, and as they added objects—plants, a lamp that would be turned on when the sun forgot its job, a small stack of books you could touch and return—Alessandro understood that he had been wrong about homes. He had assumed they ended at the threshold. He had not accounted for the part of the house that spills down the steps and onto the street and has the audacity to call itself public.

It was on that makeshift sidewalk room that his mother arrived in the late sun with a loaf of bread still warm from an oven he did not think she trusted. She sat and refused the better chair and blessed the plastic table with her elbows and asked Mira if she had ever been to the Speed River in Guelph when the ice breaks, because that is when you understand a river’s politics, and Mira told her she had grown up reading ice like braille and they had, with the swiftness of women inspecting each other’s generosity, decided they knew how to be family. His mother brought up grandchildren like a word she had promised not to say and then did anyway, and Mira smiled in a way that respected the yearning and did not take the bait. They ate bread with cheap oil that tasted like forgiveness and Alessandro found himself telling a story he had not told and did not know he remembered: the way his father had once taken him to the ledge that looked down at the 401 and taught him to marvel not at the speed but at the persistence, how he had taught him to see a stream of cars as a river that has chosen to be a failure at being a river and to love it anyway for trying.

They went walking as the light went theatrical and crept around corners for effect. The invisible guitarist had changed again and was attempting a jazz chord with the wary optimism of a cat trying a new trick. The air smelled like frost imagining itself, and they bought apples from a cart that appeared when you thought about apples as if summoned by longing. Mira told him that her small firm had been asked to present to council about the lot and its edge, not because anyone thought you could prevent rabbits from misreading punctuation but because you could ask the street to meet the creatures halfway. He nodded and tried to imagine himself at a public meeting, the way microphones make truth awkward, and thought of the open mic and his voice and decided that if necessary, he could stand and say, in a public forum, that the pain of a small animal is not small, and that sometimes morality is a matter of clover.

At home, that evening, he did the bravest domestic thing he had done in a year. He pulled the keyboard out from its unplayed exile and set it where it would be in the way rather than out of it. He left it there long enough that it became a fact, like a shoe, and then he sat and touched the keys with the respect owed old conversations. He had learned as a child because someone had told him to, and he played now because someone was sitting on his couch peeling an orange with a competence he found erotic and he wanted her to hear a part of him that had not had a name since he stopped practicing. The sound he made was careful, the way a man steps when a floor tells him it could be rotten, but it was sound, and it filled the room and then went to the lot and then jumped the chain-link and went down Yonge and came back, and he saw Mira look up as if the air had written her a note. He played badly and then better and then badly again, because the world is not a story with an arc, and when he was done she came over and kissed him in the way you kiss a person who has told a truth with their hands.

After, when the lights were all on for no reason and then off because he had learned something about the uses of dark, he lay in bed and the HVAC units across the way negotiated their truce with the weather and he did not count and he did not need to. He thought of edges, of the ones the rabbits read and the ones he had drawn inside himself with rulers because rulers make a person feel like the world will not leak. He thought of Mira’s hand on his at the console during the rabbit errand, and her mouth on his burnt finger for a second like a spell, and of his mother’s hands full of bread and history. He thought of the clinic courtyard, the way a curve can confess a human body better than a straight line, and he imagined the nurse who had paused coming out into that finished space in winter and consenting to be seen and not seen. He turned the deadbolt left until it clacked, whispered good enough to the empty hallway, and fell asleep with a confidence he did not recognize and did not interrogate, because not every good thing needs an audit.

The next day had errands in it like pebbles in a pocket. He went to the hardware store for screws that claimed they would resist both rust and despair and chatted with a man who sold bolts as if recommending novels. He stopped by Mira’s office with soup and found Charmaine wearing her hair like a crown of thunderstorms and declaring that the council meeting would be a theater and that they would wear their good seriousness. Artie had printed out aerial maps with the swagger of a magician about to reveal a mirror. They talked about sightlines and crosswalks and the ethnography of corners, and Alessandro found himself suggesting that the city put up a temporary sign that said Watch For Rabbits in a font that would not be mocked, and the room went soft with the kind of laugh that also means yes. He left with a sense that his life now had rooms he had not expected to have, rooms where people asked him things and he had ideas in exchange.

That afternoon, walking home through a version of Yonge that was temporarily a wind tunnel, he saw the boy with the ball persuading a friend to put hands on it because the ball had stopped feeling like a weapon and started feeling like an instrument. The boy looked up and nodded the way people do when they decide to treat you as fact. The lot’s fringe shook its heads amiably. A rabbit flicked its ear at a story only rabbits could hear. He wished, briefly, for a snow that would write the street in a different script and then melt and erase itself and leave everyone grateful. He arrived at the porch and Mira was there in a sweater that made him make quiet inadmissible noises, and they drank tea and talked about nothing as if nothing were the exact thing they had been meaning to mention. The evening wrapped itself around them like a coat from a closet that you had forgotten you loved and was still your size. He put his hand out and she put her hand in it and they sat until the light went to work elsewhere, which is all light ever does, and the town’s noises shuffled into their late shift and the deadbolt, when he turned it, made its satisfying clack and the house agreed, briefly, with his confidence that inside and outside were a treaty he could honor.

When the council meeting arrived, the chamber had the look of a place that had been worn into a comfort by the friction of opinions. People clutched papers to legitimize their feelings, the way children clutch stuffed animals before being brave. Mira stood at the podium with her drawings and her refusal to be hurried and talked about edges and rabbits in the same breath as sightlines and safety and children on scooters who do not yet know how to be afraid, and she said, because she knows the delicate power of the humble, that clover is not a solution but it is a kindness. A man in a suit asked a question that thought it was a trap and turned out to be a bench. A woman with reading glasses slung around her neck asked for numbers because numbers make certain people forgive anything. Alessandro stood when it was time and said, without a microphone, because the room was the size of a community and not a stadium, that he was a person in favor of making small pauses in a world that punishes stopping, and that he had seen a rabbit make a decision based on whether a shadow felt like a road. He did not tell them about rubber and he did not tell them about breath and he did not tell them about how much he loved the way Mira measured air with her hands and insisted on curves, because this was not the room for that, and yet the room understood something anyway. The motion to plant a more generous edge passed, and the room clapped with the sound people make when they believe their hands matter.

They went home under a sky that had reversed its opinion twice since noon. In the lot, the invisible surveyors of rabbit routes were on shift, laughing their iron laugh at the far end of Yonge. They stood at their chain-link and did not wait for a sign. They held each other the way people do who are beginning to learn the difference between intention and guarantee, and they whispered things of the sort that cannot be put into maps and therefore must be believed. When he turned the deadbolt left and felt the clack, it pleased him but did not define him, which was a progress he had not expected to be smooth. He slept not because the world had offered him reasons to be calm, but because his body had practiced being tired until it found that exhaustion is an argument you can win without being right. He dreamed of a city where the crosswalks sang, quietly, when small things approached, and woke convinced that this was an idea he could take to breakfast and try to make true with a letterhead and a meeting and a friend whose eyebrows had learned romance. He put on his gray sweater, poured water without measuring, and opened his door to a light he knew by heart, which not only illuminated but also did its old, secondary work: it made things, briefly, feel less heavy. He stepped onto the porch and found that the map of his feet had made a new line overnight, and he stepped there, and the day took his weight kindly.Chapter 8

Snow arrived without negotiation, not a performance but a fact, brushed on in the gray hour before the town remembered how to be a town. He woke into the brighter quiet that comes when the world covers its own clatter, lay there and listened to absence wearing a muffler, and felt, oddly, that his counting had been accounted for without him. The HVAC units cleared their throats once and then agreed to speak softly. When he opened the blinds, the lot had grown a white skin and the fringe along the chain-link made the smallest relief map, every sedge a lilt, every clover a whisper. Across the street, a rabbit had written a sentence in the new grammar and then decided it did not need a period, its tracks stopping at the fringe and then doubling back into a thicket of privet. He dressed slower, put the sweater over his hair like a ritual he could do in the dark, and turned the deadbolt left without thinking about it, which, he realized as the door clicked, was its own kind of thinking.

On Yonge the plows were practicing their rudeness with benevolence. Tire noise was a tea kettle far away. He parked near the fox mural coffee shop and the barista, wool hat low enough to argue with his eyebrows, handed over a cappuccino and said, “The world’s friendlier under blankets,” and wiped a circle of window with the palm of his hand in a domestic gesture that made something in Alessandro’s sternum soften. He carried two cups home and found Mira on her stoop in boots with laces that looked like strings in a children’s drawing, her breath proofing in front of her face. They watched the rabbit pause again in the same place as if rehearsing a good decision, and he felt, the way a person feels about a child learning to stop at the curb, that relief can be a kind of prayer.

She told him, with the casualness of a person inviting you for an errand, that she wanted him to come to Guelph on Saturday to see the Speed River when it pretends it doesn’t know how to be a river under ice. She said her father would make soup and point at the water and say things about patience as if he invented it. He said yes with his mouth and then felt his chest perform the choreography of a small panic: unfamiliar bed, unfamiliar clock, unfamiliar sequence of faucets. He put a hand on the top of that panic like you put a lid on a pot, not to stop it but to ask it to simmer, and wrote in his mind a list of things he could leave off the list. When he told his mother he was going she made a pleased noise and then a note of warning about highways in snow and then, unable to resist the oldest impulse, told him which thermos to bring because all thermoses are liars except hers.

Guelph had the posture of a city that had read a book about itself and agreed with most of it. The Speed was a gray folding of light, its surfaces thinking, the edges refusing to choose. Mira walked along the path as if greeting a friend she had gotten along with better when she was small and could afford to fall in. Her father was a tall man with a beard that had learned moderation and a voice that sat down in a chair before it spoke. He smelled faintly of lemon oil and varnish, and his house had the serenity of rooms that have been repaired with patience. He showed Alessandro a drawer of screws sorted by a logic that seemed personal and inevitable, and the two of them stood in a small silence men make when they agree to tell each other nothing and everything at once by choosing to look at a hinge together.

They walked to a bend in the river where the ice made decrees. Her father tapped with a stick at a safe distance and spoke about how thaw is not a pity but a plan, how a river remembers and we don’t. Mira skipped a flat stone onto a patch of air disguised as glass and then laughed at herself when the stone skittered away as if embarrassed. Alessandro stood and let the cold pin his cheeks to his bones and thought of the lot and the clover under snow and how everything he cared for seemed to be practicing invisibility in winter. He realized he had walked around his own life as if it were made of frozen lawn, unwilling to trust that the green would return, and felt the thought settle without drama. Back at the house they sat at a table that had the confidence of an heirloom without the arrogance, and the soup was exactly what soup is supposed to be when the world is a white room, and Mira’s father told him, gently, a story about leaving a job that paid too well because it didn’t believe in his hands. Alessandro listened the way you listen for thin ice—the attention careful and full of respect—and saw in the man’s patience the first blueprint of the woman across from him, and it made him grateful and a little inclined to superstition.

They stayed in a spare room with a quilt that had ambitions to be weather and a clock that ticked in a cadence unfamiliar enough to feel like a song he did not know the words to. He lay awake beside Mira with his hand on the place between her shoulder and her throat that was a good place for hands to learn how to be unimportant. He did not count. He recollected the HVAC hum and found out that a river’s mutter can be counted too if you want to be unforgivable. He decided not to, and in the decision there was something like courage. In the morning, he made the coffee wrong and she drank it with an appreciation that was either love or field research, and he fixed his mistake the second time and pretended he hadn’t cared about getting it right, which is almost the same as not caring.

The clinic courtyard opening arrived on a Monday that wanted to be a Thursday. The path curved as Mira had insisted and the benches, angled toward each other like people mid-confession, looked like good ideas you could sit on. The water rill murmured on purpose, telling the polite lie that life is slow, and no one corrected it. Nurses stood in their green and blue with their tired made neat, and a man in ordinary shoes placed a hand briefly on a wall as if walls had pulses. There was a moment when a wind came down the narrow sky and reminded everyone of gravity, and then a woman in a wheelchair asked to be placed so she could see the bit of tree, not the bit of brick, and Alessandro watched the way Mira moved her, not with efficiency but with a knowledge of angles that has nothing to do with geometry.

He had brought the keyboard with its old guilt and its new purpose and set it where the sound would not scare anyone yet might keep them company. He played the three songs he could play without stopping and the one he could nearly play if he did not look at his hands. He found, oddly, that the curve of the path coached his fingers, that the rill’s insistence on not rushing made his tempo better, and that when he hit a wrong note and did not apologize with his mouth, no one died. Wayne came in his off-hours tie, which had paisleys that were bolder than his work day would allow, and clapped with a precision that made the claps count as permission. Mira leaned against a pillar and watched him with the expression he had seen her reserve for projects that had stopped pretending to be drafts.

He wrote his letter about singing crosswalks in a fit of domestic bravery, three paragraphs that admitted their own ignorance and wore it like a scarf. He sent it to a council inbox addressed To Whom Attention Concerns and copied Artie and Charmaine and even, for reasons he could not articulate, Karan, who responded with a subject line that read SING, CROSSWALK, SING and an attachment of a cartoon rabbit holding a baton. It turned out that the city already had chirps and ticks for eyes that wanted help hearing, and it turned out that a man named Ramesh in a small office had always wanted to put warmth in the sound because the current beep beep was too courthouse, not enough human. He met Ramesh on a Tuesday in a room that smelled like dust willing itself to behave, and together they listened to a selection of possible songs that had been designed not to be songs. Alessandro had never known that his ear wanted to be needed. He closed his eyes and heard the difference between a chirp that scolded and a chirp that welcomed and said as much, and Ramesh, who had the tired of a father and the humor of a man who has fought budget line items, smiled like an invention and said, “You hear it too.”

Snow changed the streets into a machine that prints gentleness on soles. He found that his rituals had been seasonally adjusted. He wiped his boots more thoroughly because the world came in on the edges, and because he did not want slush on Mira’s rug. He counted the squeaks of the rubber at the door and then forgave himself for counting, then forgot the numbers and remembered the way her shoulders rose when she laughed behind her scarf. They walked to the pond in late afternoon and watched a child spit his tongue out to catch flakes as if catching grace, and they let themselves be silly. He put his tongue out too and she kissed him in a quick domestic joke, and it felt like a door opening onto a room he had suspected existed and had not decorated. The invisible guitarist had gone quiet or south and someone else had taken up the job of making air hum, a woman whose scales you could hear through her window like a shopkeeper counting coins.

Karan came over with pakoras and gossip and, uninvited, affection. He stood at the edge of the porch room and kicked the snow off his shoes with the dramatic suffering of a man who loves a season and also resents it. He presented a doodle of Sir Hasty in a wool hat and insisted on being informed about the council’s taste in fonts. He asked, three times and then once more for comedic timing, whether Alessandro had started to write poems in spreadsheets, and Alessandro—who had discovered that he was not entirely safe from such a conversion—lied poorly. They sat and ate while Mira explained the problem of salt to plants, and Karan, who had the calm of people who can make columns add, told a story about how his uncle spreads sand because it makes the street look like it has freckles and makes the day more trustworthy. On his way out he hugged Mira with that cautious awkwardness men have with women they like in ways that are brother and teammate and citizen, and he hugged Alessandro with the confidence of someone who assumes consent and had earned it, and when he left, the porch felt a little more like a room with corners.

Mira’s phone learned how to be quiet without being off. The not-quite-ex wrote, in the way of men who have found a cliff and want to describe it from a safe distance, that snow made him remember things that had not happened. She replied once with decency and then put the device in a drawer where seed packets slept, and when it buzzed and did not get moved, Alessandro felt both proud and a little ashamed for keeping score. He told her, badly but honestly, that he wanted to be trusted with the part of her that still packed a bag in her mind, not to zip it shut but to make sure there was an orange inside in case of hunger, and she said, in the same dialect, that she wanted to be trusted with the part of him that needed to check the stove twice and the lock left until it clacked, not to break the habit but to put her hand on his wrist and call the clicks by their names. They were, it turned out, practicing the strange skill of admitting that their work would always be homework.

His mother learned how to put on boots with a weather report in her hand like a birth certificate. She came by with biscotti that could have been tools and said, standing in the porch room as if elected to it, that the city had put up a small sign near the lot that said LOOK FOR WILDLIFE in a font that thought it was doing something and she would bring a thicker marker. Mira showed her the clover under march ice, pushing its way into the world like a word in the wrong language that everyone decides to keep anyway because it is beautiful. They drank coffee that had almost burned and was forgiven and talked about how garlic is a religion and basil an excuse. His mother left with a loaf of bread and one of Mira’s seed packets sticking out of her good purse, and when she turned and waved from the sidewalk, he saw, not for the first time, how her body had learned to be two sizes at once, one for this season and one for a time when she had to be bigger to carry him.

He went to the used bookstore and the cat, pleased with the snow’s decision to make outside temporarily interesting again, consented to be petted for exactly eight seconds. He found another book with notes in the margins written by the same restless hand, a hand that had circled a good bench and written in the white space, if you sit here you’ll see three conversations and none of them will require you to speak. He bought it as if buying a promise and brought it home and marked a place on the porch for a bench they did not yet own. Mira, when he showed her, kissed him on the cheek and then the mouth and said, “You are building a library out of mistakes other people were generous enough to make and write down.”

The singing crosswalk got its pilot at the corner by the square, and the sound when it began was small and particular, a chirr that was not a scold but a nod. He stood on the corner and watched people listen. A woman with a white cane tipped her head like a bird to align the sound with her body and stepped into the street with a confidence that made his eyes sting in a way he didn’t bother to hide. A boy pressed the button three times because he could and the chirr did not get angry, just patient, and his mother laughed and said, “Okay, maestro,” and held his hand while the light made its opinion clear. A rabbit would not be saved by sound in the human octave, but Alessandro felt, in the selfish way of people who love symbolic victories, that the city had admitted out loud that small lives make choices that matter.

They slept together on a night the snow had decided to soften its insistence. It happened without an aria, the way rain sometimes begins when you are too far from shelter to make a plan and you do not mind because you are already wet. After, they lay with the window slightly open and listened to the world breathe damp and were not afraid of drafts. He kept his hand on the part of her back that makes the hand feel like it belongs to the species and thought of the space between the rabbit’s eyes where the fur changes direction like a small wind and felt, not for the first time, undeserving and happy and persuaded that you can be both and the day will not revoke your right to continue.

The next morning the porch was a catalog of prints. Bird scribbles, cat sentences, the confident long ovals of a dog that did not believe in obstacles, the nervous staccato of a squirrel’s hurry, the careful punctuation of a rabbit. He knelt and read what he could with the literacy of a beginner and made up the rest. Mira laughed at the way he narrated and corrected his grammar once, and then let him have the story because there is a luxury in letting someone else describe your street as if it were a foreign city, and because he had brought her coffee in a mug that matched nothing and therefore matched everything.

When the council invited them back to talk about the permanent planting on a ridiculous Tuesday when the wind could have been rented to cautionary tales, he wore a tie his mother had given him that did not go with his hair and did not apologize. He spoke about pauses again, and Ramesh spoke about sound in public and as public, and a woman who had never met a rabbit told a story about a groundhog, which comforted Alessandro because it meant people cannot resist trying to love what they have at hand. They showed a map that made the fringe generous, and a cost that made the fringe possible, and at the end a man who had only asked questions that were about the next election shook Alessandro’s hand as if his palm had learned something that his mouth could not say without loss. Outside, the wind threw its shoulders against the doors and reassured everyone that you could like people and still prefer weather.

He found himself, in March, practicing the balance between planning and surrender in the small, serious matter of making dinner. He burned onions badly and then saved them with patience and butter, and he discovered that garlic will forgive you if you beg it correctly. Mira made a salad that looked like a map of a city that had decided to take care of itself, and they ate standing at the counter as if chairs were a trap, and he realized that eating standing can be a domestic sacrament when done in concert. He told her about a dream in which the crosswalk sang the wrong melody and everyone danced into traffic and then laughed out loud at his own horror, and she told him about a dream in which the river climbed out of its bed and lay down in a field like a dog and waited for someone to scratch behind its ears, and they agreed that the brain is a theater and the usher is drunk.

When spring took off its coat and hung it on the back of a chair, the clover revealed its second language. The lot greened faster than the promises had suggested, and the fringe at the chain-link made a new kind of shadow. The boy with the ball had become a boy with a bicycle and rang his bell with a courtesy that sounded like flirtation with the future. Rabbits came with their varsity jackets, their bodies more confident than winter allows, and paused and paused and sometimes dared the space between cars, and sometimes did not, and the percentages moved a hair in the right direction. He stood there one evening with Mira, the light manufacturing gold without shame, and thought of everything he had wanted to prevent and could not and everything he had managed to pause for half a breath, and counted nothing and called that his inventory.

He went to the clinic courtyard on a day when grief had moved in like weather you feel in your bones and sat alone on a bench angled toward the possibility of conversation. A woman sat down two benches away and pretended to read a magazine and did not turn the pages, and an orderly pushed a cart with gentleness and decisive wrists. The water said what it always says to people waiting for news, which is not a sentence but a posture. He played nothing. He let the place do its work. He watched a man watching light on brick and saw the moment the man remembered that walls reflect and reflection is not ownership, and he felt himself a low-grade electrician, satisfied by a circuit closing without sparks.

On a Wednesday with no special ambition, Wayne held the lobby door and did not say account for yourself. He just put a hand on Alessandro’s shoulder and kept it there long enough to suggest a longer sentence and then let go without making a point. Later, in the elevator, a stranger adjusted their scarf in the mirror and said to no one, “It’s lighter,” and he decided not to figure out whether the stranger meant the scarf or the air, because both were true and both belonged to him as much as they did not. The day held together with fewer staples than usual. The numbers lined up like children who had learned the trick of pleasing a teacher without resenting the trick, and Karan spun a stapler on his finger and told Alessandro, apropos of nothing, that he had decided to become kind on purpose because it is the only way to be good at it.

At night, when the HVAC units across the strip mall rumbled into their warmer weather negotiations and the hum changed key again, he lay with the window open and a small traffic of moths interested in nothing he could give them. He thought of ink in margins, of the man or woman whose handwriting had made the city's benches legible, of the cat who had judged him and then tolerated him, of the boy with the ball who had learned a pause and kept it like a coin in the pocket of his shorts. He thought of Mira lifting her hands to measure air and of his mother measuring garlic with her heart, of Ramesh agreeing to warmer chirps, of Charmaine choosing a curve over an angle because kindness is sometimes a shape. He turned the deadbolt left until it clacked, said aloud to the house what he had been saying often enough that the walls had adopted the phrase as a second coat of paint, good enough, and fell asleep with the strange, uncounted confidence that he could wake in any light and know where to place his feet.Chapter 9 began with a day that had the itch of a new shirt, the fabric of it asking to be lived in. The maples had gone from prophetic buds to declarations, the clover along the chain-link wrote cursive where before there had been print, and the singing crosswalk at the square had accumulated a small audience of people who pretended to check their phones while timing their steps to its warmer chirr. Alessandro woke with the ordinary bravery of a person who has decided to let the morning make its own argument. He poured water without looking for the line on the glass, left a spoon unstraightened on the counter, and listened for the hum that told him the strip mall across the way had remembered its vocation. It had. He smiled at this proof that both change and perseverance could be true at once and thought, with a little private pride he did not parade, that his counting now had manners.

By the time he reached the porch with two cups from the fox mural place sweating amiably in his hands, the lot had a rabbit already mid-pause at the fringe, an adult with the authority of survived winters. Mira knelt without ceremony to peer at a place where the sedge seemed slightly mussed, the plant equivalent of a couch cushion with an opinion, and he saw her smile widen into the particular grin she reserved for secrets that did not belong to her and would be treated better because of it. “Nest,” she said, not loudly, not as a claim, but as if noting a constellation. He crouched beside her and saw, tucked under a thatch of last year’s grass and this year’s intentions, the faint bowl with its lining of rabbit fur that looked like weather. He felt the ridiculous gratitude of a man whose treaty had been read and signed by a separate government. They made a small fence of stakes and twine, a modest ring that said to human feet and curious dogs: here is a door you will not use, thank you. The boy with the ball arrived as if summoned and accepted, with gravitas, a job: keep an eye out, say so if a mower wanders close, be the voice of rabbits without having to speak rabbit.

At the school garden, miracles were wearing their ugly phase. Shoots confessed themselves with the bravado of teenagers, weeds made their bid for democracy, and Ms. Bell had acquired the expression of a person who has read the last page of a book and is pretending not to know the ending. The grade fours, now with dirt under their nails solidified as identity, arrived with shoelaces still misbehaving and opinions that had only gotten more precise. They pulled up radishes too soon and adored their peppery disappointment. Sir Hasty was spotted making his implacable journey across a watering can and was greeted with a chorus that made Alessandro think of the way stadiums attend to slow sports. He leveled what could be leveled and then, in a gesture that had become beloved to him, let certain unstraightnesses be gifts. A girl with a gap where a front tooth was working on arriving handed him a tiny carrot that had the shape of a question mark and said, “This one is thinking,” and he agreed, grateful to be instructed in edible punctuation.

The used bookstore’s cat had decided the season required new real estate and lay now in the window on a stack of travelogues about rivers with names that wanted to be said slowly. Alessandro had begun to notice, in the marginalia books he brought home, a theme that, like a friend’s handwriting, made itself legible with repetition. The unseen annotator loved benches and edges and places where people believed themselves to be private in public and vice versa. In a book about small cities that forgot to be great and therefore succeeded, the hand had drawn an arrow next to a photograph of an alley hung with laundry and written: the truest theater is the clothesline. He showed Mira and she closed her eyes briefly the way she does when she agrees with something in a way that makes her bones ring. “We should put a clothesline in the porch room,” she said, half as a joke and half as a real plan, and he pictured shirts swaying like flags and the small neighborly politics of socks.

It would have been too neat for the line of Mira’s not-quite-ex to go quiet because the weather had improved. Instead, in the charitable light of April, the name appeared again on her phone with the persistence of a dandelion in expensive grass. She handed it to Alessandro without ceremony and he read the new note’s attempt at sincerity, its inventory of remorse, its weaponized recollection of the way she had made a kitchen feel larger than it was. He felt that two-part ache—one part compassion for an old chapter with corners still sharp, one part possessive wish to move a mountain to the coast—and he set the phone face down on the table like a piece of fruit not yet ripe. “If you want to talk to him, talk,” he said, and meant it almost completely. Mira breathed out through her nose, which was her polite way of banning a meeting in her own heart, and said, “Sometimes I think missing is like a sport certain men train for because it gives them a shape,” and he nodded and did not offer himself as a shape in rebuttal. That night, when she packed and unpacked the imaginary bag with that zipper sound that told her nervous system a bedtime story, he sat on the floor and counted aloud to three and then stopped, not to fix her, but to make a rhythm in the room that did not come from fear.

Ramesh—the city engineer with his quiet orchestra of beeps—invited Alessandro to a room that had nothing to recommend it aesthetically beyond a window that framed a birch so perfectly it seemed contrived. They listened to variations on chirps that had been designed in other places and for other crossings, and Alessandro learned to hear in them accents he had not suspected: Scandinavian caution, American legalism, a Brazilian friendliness he found himself preferring because it made the sidewalk sound like a patio. “Warmth without whimsy,” Ramesh said, and Alessandro laughed because that had become secretly his own project, to refuse the cruel kind of seriousness without falling into unseriousness. They picked three, wrote a memo whose words had to dress themselves in sober clothing, and left the room to men with measuring tapes and bored competence, which is to say: it became real.

At the clinic courtyard, he found himself visiting without an appointment with anyone’s sadness. Sometimes he took the keyboard, sometimes only his hands, which had their own way of failing usefully. He played when it seemed the air wanted notes to lean on and did not when the air was already holding its breath. An older man in a suit that was trying its best sat next to him one afternoon and did not speak until the second song ended. “My wife would have liked that,” the man said, and then, after a careful, bureaucratic pause, “She liked repetitions.” Alessandro nodded and did the most audacious thing he had learned to do lately—he asked, gently, “Which ones?” The man smiled without looking at him and said that his wife had loved the sound of washing machines and had always claimed the last cycle knew something about forgiveness the rest of us should study. He came home and put a cardigan over his shirt because he wanted to feel ridiculous and loved, and told Mira that his new ambition was to build a life full of washing-machine-last-cycle moments.

His mother, emboldened by her own capacity for adjustment and encouraged by Mira’s sincere approval of garlic’s right to be itself, proposed a Sunday lunch that felt like a demonstration of municipal cooperation. She invited Mira’s father as if commanding a river to change course, and when he arrived carrying a loaf and a polite bottle of wine, she greeted him with the heavy sweetness she saves for men who know how to sit and listen to a story with their shoulders. At the table, Mira’s father and Alessandro’s mother conducted an exchange of practical philosophies that made Alessandro want to take notes. “The problem with soup,” said his mother, “is people think it hides mistakes. It is a liar if you let it be. If the broth is wrong, it is all wrong.” “Yes,” said Mira’s father, turning his spoon in admiration, “and the problem with varnish is the same. It can make bad wood look like good wood until the first season tells you the truth.” They laughed like conspirators, and Mira squeezed Alessandro’s knee under the table, which is the kind of communication for which languages evolved and then forgot their origins.

The nest in the lot proved itself with a violence so small it was almost unbearable. One morning, when the light had barely bothered to warm itself, Alessandro and Mira watched from the porch as a patch of fur in the nest trembled and then split into movement. Kits. They were nothing like the cartoonish offspring of spring products. They were beans with ideas, eyes still shut, ears folded like secrets. Mira made the lowest sound her throat could make without being a hum. They kept back like good neighbors pretending not to watch a family through a window, and Alessandro found himself narrating in the smallest words he knew, not for the kits but for his own body, which needed to be told that it was witnessing a success. The boy with the ball took his stewardship seriously and told a dog walker, in a voice he was trying to make older than it was, that the small fence was not an aesthetic choice. The dog walker, a woman who had weather for hair, saluted him gravely and found a different route. At dusk, Mrs. Delaney stood with her arms crossed like a general and announced, to no one in particular and everyone in proximity, that she had called the city about a mower schedule and had once again saved civilization.

Failure did not stay away to reward them. A fledgling appeared under the maple with its wings not yet knowing their job, a ball of quiet with an alarm system. They consulted laminated cards and websites that were either hysterical or passive and did the new, hard thing of leaving it alone. They stood near enough to intervene if a cat declared an intention, far enough to allow a parent to dive in with an insect and a scold. Alessandro felt the ache in his teeth that only helplessness produces and practiced, clumsily, a patience that did not look like apathy. When, after an hour that behaved like a day, the fledgling hop-fluttered to a branch and its mother arrived like an arrow that had forgiven physics, he exhaled in a way that confused the part of his chest that keeps track of exit strategies.

Karan, who had begun to treat Alessandro’s life as a serialized entertainment in which he had invested emotionally and financially (two pakoras per episode), arrived one evening with gossip about fonts at the council and eyebrows that were becoming a language. He told them, with the relish of a man reporting on a war whose casualties were strictly typographic, that a deputy insisted on a sans serif for the LOOK FOR WILDLIFE signs because serifs suggested pretense, and Charmaine had argued with such grace that the compromise to a humanist font had made everyone feel attractive. He asked about the kits and was rewarded with a view of the small fence and the occasional adult disguise of grass moving. He drew, in the margin of a water bill, Sir Hasty wearing a reflective vest and a very serious expression and wrote UNIX FOR SNAILS under it because sometimes a joke doesn’t need an audience to be inevitable.

The night the kits opened their eyes, they also found the courage to test the door of the world, and Alessandro felt the absurd mix of hope and despair that attends all first staircases. One made a wobbling bid for the gap in the twine and discovered that ground is not wall, and he nearly said no aloud, a word intended for physics. The mother—ancient, practical, owner of one of the best educations in Richmond Hill—shouldered it back with a composure that put every council meeting to shame. It was then that Alessandro realized how much of his life had been committed to the project of making the word no unnecessary, an generosity that had sometimes disguised fear as kindness, and he felt, with relief, that no could be a gate, not a wall, and that he could learn to build one carefully for the right reasons.

He moved clothes into her closet without making a speech about it, two shirts first, then a sweater that had betrayed spring and was still needed, then socks which are always declarations no matter how you place them. She left a trowel in his umbrella jar as if introducing two objects to a kind of marriage of use. Domesticity arrived in their rooms not as a ceremony but as a thousand decisions about where spoons slept. He learned the angle of her head when she watched him chop onions, the way she wanted a glass of water nearby as if for the onions more than herself, the way she blessed a pan with heat before committing oil to it. She learned the way he apologized to mugs when he put them down too hard, the way he ran a cloth over the counter with the same mindfulness he used when balancing a column that refused to be polite. He found that his need to turn the deadbolt left until it clacked becoming less of a compulsion and more of a song he could sing or not, and that the house, like a tolerant audience, applauded either way.

They took the train to the city and walked through neighborhoods where curves were a commitment the original surveyors had not made. Mira showed him a pocket park she loved where a fence had learned to disappear and a bench had taught extroverts how to sit quietly. He showed her a bank lobby that had become a basilica by mistake, sunlight caught in its shoulders like a choir’s instruction. They bought mangos from a man on a corner who called everyone cousin and went to a public meeting about a laneway where some wanted cars and some wanted possibility. A woman in a reflective vest asked a question that was not a question and Mira answered it with a sentence that was mostly pronouns and everyone understood anyway. Later, on a street that had become smug with its trees, they saw a woman reading on her stoop and Alessandro felt, viscerally, that the city’s best rooms have bad insulation and good permission.

When his mother called, as she did with the reliability of a friend who likes to arrive exactly when the kettle clicks, she told him that she had seen on her street a man park and then sit in his car for ten minutes looking at his hands. “Do you think he was counting,” she asked, “or praying?” He considered what kindness the answer could carry and told her that both are sometimes the same, and she made the noise she reserves for good synonyms and told him to bring Mira on Saturday because there were peppers that needed to be shown what a flame looks like. He sat on the porch after and looked at his hands until the street became interested in them too, and he counted to five and then back and then said the names of things in his line of sight softly enough that the words did not feel used up: cedar, envelope, hinge, light.

The singing crosswalks multiplied in the way spring does when it decides to be inevitable. Ramesh sent him a link to a video of a crossing in another part of town singing its polite welcome to a woman with a stroller and a man with a cane and a teenager whose shoulders were trying to tell a story his mouth could not yet. He sent back a picture of rabbits at the fringe, kits now with the beginnings of a swagger, and wrote: our citizens are learning to pause. Ramesh wrote: my mother would tell you to put salt on the pause and keep it for winter, and Alessandro laughed and felt the good sensation of belonging to a network of earnest, slightly ridiculous adults building small, decent things.

Anxiety arrived one night like an uninvited uncle at a wedding—boisterous, misplaced, insistent, smelling like something halfway between fear and habit. It woke him, the old heat in the chest and the sweat in the palms, that familiar emergency with no emergency to wear. He lay still and listened to the HVAC across the strip mall make its case and did not count, then did, then forgave himself both ways. Mira, half-asleep, slid a hand up to his neck and put her thumb under his ear the way she had once soothed a frightened puppy and said his name as if it were a verb that meant stay. He told her, because truth had become a routine in their house, that he was afraid of forgetting something important, that his body had become an archivist who had mislaid the key. She breathed with him the way you do for a child laboring after a hill on a bicycle and told him a snail story, one she had not told in a while: a snail crossing a sidewalk where the chalk hopscotch had been drawn and rained on and drawn again, its body writing its own rules across other people’s games. He pictured the trail like a silver thread and followed it out of the panic’s room and into his own, and fell asleep with the sense of having been, briefly, very far and now safely home.

The council approved the permanent planting plan for the lot with a unanimity that would have frightened him once, because unanimity can smell like inattention. This time he trusted it, not because the room had become smarter but because the project had taught the room something about the size of small things. The day the city crew came with their efficient shovels and slow cigarettes, he stood back and watched the way men lean on handles as if considering philosophy. Mira walked the border like a tailor with a pin cushion, checking hems. The boy with the ball, now the boy with the bicycle and a helmet he had decorated with stickers that looked like small planets, announced himself foreman and was given a badge made of masking tape. Mrs. Delaney supervised with dispatch and cookies. By late afternoon, the fringe had doubled, the shadow it made on the sidewalk looked like proof, and a woman who had never noticed rabbits before stopped and said, “Oh,” in the way people say when they believe they have discovered a thing you have placed carefully in their path for exactly that moment.

The invisible guitarist returned by degrees and now, in weather that had decided to be evening-colored for hours at a time, he attempted a standard Alessandro did not have the education to name but could feel. Mira and he sat on the steps with pears that had ripened into their right to exist and the boy with the bicycle rang his bell as if announcing a first act. Across the street, a rabbit paused and then chose the longer route that kept it alive. He put his hand on the wooden spindle of the porch rail and felt under his palm the roughness he had come to trust, and he turned the deadbolt left later without thinking about it at all, which is not to say he did not care, but to say that care had become a room he could leave and return to as needed. He said good enough to the hallway and meant not perfection but affection, not surrender but consent. The light, doing its old job and its new one twice over, fell on their faces and the map of his feet had indeed made a new line that morning and he had followed it here without asking for directions.

The night before the first proper heatwave—the heat that means summer does not need an invitation—he pulled the keyboard away from the wall and played in the porch room because the air in the apartment had decided to be clingy. Neighbors paused, not rudely, and listened to the rill of uncertain notes. A woman he did not know leaned on the fence and hummed harmony under a melody he had not intended, and it fit. Mira watered the pots in a pattern he had come to recognize as her private mathematics and, when he missed a note in a way that made him wince, she smiled without turning and said, as if describing weather, “Not wrong, just earlier than the rest.” He thought of all the ways in which his life had been early or late and decided that, for once, he would not ask for a schedule. A moth battered itself against the lamp with no intention to learn and he cupped it and let it out into a night that had, for the time being, chosen to be gentle. He sat back down and played the wrong note again and this time did not mind at all.

When sleep came, it arrived like a modest guest, not drawing attention to itself, slipping into the room in socks. He dreamed that the crosswalks sang not just at corners but at thresholds, that doors chirped a welcome when small creatures approached, that rabbits wore no backpacks because they did not need supplies beyond the pause. He dreamed that the city put benches exactly where people already sat and signed the decision with a flourish, and that Mr. Wayne, in his tie of migratory salmon, stood at the podium and asked the town to account for itself and was answered with the sound of many small things continuing to live. He woke with a sense that he had been somewhere plausible and good, washed his face without thinking of the glass’s line, and stepped onto the porch to a light he knew by heart that told him, tenderly and without drama, that the day had saved him a seat.
