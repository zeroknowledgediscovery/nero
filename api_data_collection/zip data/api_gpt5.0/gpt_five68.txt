On the third night of the month, with the river slurring slowly under the bridges, a little thing in a long coat slipped along the market’s back passages. The security lights clicked on, clicked off, blinking a fly’s eye of white. Somewhere a metal shutter coughed, a fox knocked over a bin lid. The little thing paused to listen to the clatter and then moved again, faster, his gait a skitter. He wore a coat that had been a coat for someone else first—grey, too large, frayed along the cuffs—yet he carried it with a primness that didn’t match the rails of rust he hopped, the slick algae steps by the canal where he hid when sirens whined past.

He had a name because every monster in the stories did, and he had learned to like stories; the name had been on a sticker on a suitcase he found in a skip one winter, ripped half-off, DOMIN—and he said it in his head until the rest arrived as if conjured: Dominik. Better than the other words people had thrown, foreign sounds sticking to him. Dominik could be said through teeth, softly.

He watched the teenagers skip across the common in their bright shoes, their wild swing of limbs and heedless speech. He watched their kicks and complaints, their music scratching out from a phone speaker, and his shoulders climbed towards his ears, tight. The laughter stung. Joy was a loose thread in his world; he wanted it cut. He remembered the warmth of ovens in the tunnels, the rasp of racks sliding in and out, the way a city smells like damp flour when it’s sleeping. He remembered small hands kneading a dough of fear and hope into something that steamed and vanished. He remembered recipes that were more map than meal, the way hunger bent rules.

Dominik had a journal, kept under a tile in the disused bakery by the river—beneath the cracked glass ceiling where the pigeons shook soot out of their feathers and the old mixers rested like sleeping beasts. He’d written in it with a stub of pencil, writing as if the paper could bite, each line a guess at how to do it better: a recipe of city and winter, of lost and found. He didn’t like to think of it as anything other than work. His work. The world had leeched colour from him and he worked to put it back, into crust and fold and the gloss when the pie comes out well. He was patient. Patience was one of the only clean things left to him.

He left a sprinkle of flour behind wherever he went. Not always on purpose. There was flour in his hair, or what passed for hair; flour in the cuffs of the too-long coat; flour under his nails. A dusting on the sill meant he had come through; a dusting on a sill meant, now and then, that someone would not be coming back.

On the other side of the city, on a road that began in salt and heat if you followed it all the way through memory and sky to Florida, DCI Mara Rollinson ran. She ran with the soft metronome of a person who knows exactly where each foot will hit. She ran past early sandwich shops, steaming, past a woman who watered geraniums with a kettle from her upstairs window, past a little cat who owned the pavement. Tallahassee stitched itself into her stride whether she liked it or not—the sprawl of sun-shot roads, the boil of summer, the track that had been her first real friend. She ran not because she was training for anything. She ran because it made the edges of things less jagged.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket. She didn’t check it until the river’s purple-grey was a little less indifferent and she could slow, breathing a little cloud. It was Keating, always too early, always with the text that made adrenaline gnaw.

You’ll want to see this. Another one. Gas Street Market.

She checked the time; the run had cost her forty-eight minutes; she’d shaved two off that last hill without trying. Okay, she thought, let me be inevitable. She jogged home, cold creeping under her nails, felt the Florida in her bones rebel against another British autumn that began in August and refused to leave.

The market looked different before dawn, all its regular raucousness asleep. Even asleep it had a face. Stalls that by day were bright were now skeletal; the chalkboards had ghost writing; the butcher’s window, empty, reflected the police tape in a trick of blue. There were officers at the edges trying to look like they were holding something back that wasn’t a giant nothingness. Keating stood with his arms crossed, his coat pretending to be warmer than it was.

“You’re up,” he said, as if this were a surprise.

“Out,” she said. “What’ve we got?”

“Missing fifteen hours,” he said. “Last seen nine last night. A boy. Seventeen. Headed this way on foot from his shift at the cinema. Mother rang when he didn’t come home. CCTV… we’re still pulling. But there’s flour.”

Rollinson looked at him. He nodded towards the shutter to the old bakery, the one that had been closed since the flood. The council had posted plans for a pop-up co-working space and never come back. Flour on the bottom lip of the door, pushed up by someone ducking under.

“Flour,” she said. “We’re detectives, aren’t we.”

He rolled his eyes. “Come on.”

Inside the abandoned bakery the air was colder than out, smelled of damp and something underneath you didn’t have to name to know: stale sweetness, the ghost of a burn. The mixers were hulks in the centre, like pale whales just after they beach. There were footprints—most of them in dust, some of them damp—and the cream-coloured powder that might have been flour or might, if you were anxious, have been chalk, or bone, or a city trying to make itself again and failing. The forensics tech, Miu, waved a gloved hand at the floor.

“Watch your trail,” she said, not unkindly. “We’ve got a few good prints. Size six. Maybe six and a half. Very narrow.”

“Six?” Keating made a face. “Tiny lad.”

“The tiny lad might be the wrong assumption,” Miu said. “We’ve had size six grown men.”

“Stop looking at me,” Keating said.

Rollinson crouched with a slow care that felt like a promise. She stared at the footprints. They weren’t quite right. The pressure went odd at the outer edge. Someone who didn’t place weight quite like a human did, or someone with a deformity, or someone who’d learned to walk differently because it was safer, once.

“Any CCTV from outside?” she asked, still half bent.

“Pulling,” Keating said. “The camera by the florist’s might have caught something. The others are either out or were looking exactly the wrong way because it would be too easy otherwise.”

Rollinson stood and breathed again, the cold tasting like a penny. “And the boy?”

“Names Eli Drummond. Sixth form. Works evenings tearing tickets. Plays guitar badly, if we believe his Instagram. No trouble that Mum knows about. Girlfriend says she fell asleep FaceTiming him at ten and woke to an empty call at ten-thirty. He never made it home. Mother says he’s afraid of the dark; I don’t know how that helps.”

“It helps,” she said, because anything you learn about a person before you know if they’re alive or dead helps in exactly the same way.

They found the note under the cooling rack. It wasn’t a note in the way of notes—nothing written, in any case. A circle of pastry, raw, flour dappled like winter sky, with three thumbprints in the centre, arranged like a clover. It had been left where someone would look. Ritual without explanation was a trap for the mind. Rollinson looked away first.

“Don’t touch,” she said, and Miu nodded, as if she had intended to lick it but had been talked down.

They walked the market twice, three times, the map of it in their heads slowly lighting up. Born at the river’s edge, the place had always been a market, even when nobody bought or sold anything except secrets and fish. It had had its strange little criminals, its sweet talkers and knife hands, its list of wrongness written on the underside of every stall. It did not have a goblin. It did not have a monster.

Yet the story had been in the papers two winters ago: a whisper that kids were going missing at the edges of night and that the only link was a smear of milky powder, a scent like bread. The tabloids, lazy and loving fables, had given him a name. Not Dominik. Something simpler. He had learned to listen for it, the way one listens for a tune you hate and can’t stop humming.

At ten they went to see the mother. She lived on the second floor of a building that kept trying to fall into the canal and had been told by scaffolding that it wasn’t allowed. She had a hairline parting through which Rollinson could see the pale line where childhood had sat and then slid away. She poured tea with the blind hands of someone exhausted into bone. Her name was Carmen Drummond, and she had a voice that had once been the weather and was now only the sound after the weather passes.

“He’s never done anything like this,” Carmen said. “He’s a good boy. He plays too loud. He forgets to take the bin out. He buys those drinks with the lights in them.” She gripped the mug. “He wouldn’t run off.”

“We don’t think he ran off,” Rollinson said. She didn’t say they were already using the word boy like an eraser on a map.

“What do you think?” Carmen said. There was no time where Rollinson could have lied. The woman was past gentle misdirection.

“I think someone might have taken him,” Rollinson said. “I think we are going to use every single thing we know how to use to get him home. I need you to tell me absolutely everything that happened in the last week. How he’s been sleeping. Who he’s been talking to. The places he cuts through. The shortcuts he thinks are clever.”

Carmen nodded, and the nod turned to a shake, and then she was crying and apologizing for crying and then apologizing for apologizing. Keating poured the tea that cooled as he poured it. The cat that owned the building wandered in under the door, checked everyone for competence, and left again.

By noon there was footage. Eli with his hood up, though it wasn’t raining. Eli with his hands in his pockets like he thought if he pulled them out somebody would ask him to prove something. Eli glancing at the camera like a magician checking the angle of a trick. Then Eli turning down the narrow lane that ran behind the market, where the bins waited for morning and a whisper of river hung in the air. A minute later, a flicker. Not a person, not really. A twitch in the dark that our eyes wanted to name. Then camera blur, then nothing at all except a fox checking the horizon, its tail a punctuation mark.

“Enhance,” Keating said, cheerfully, and then, seeing Miu’s expression, “I know, I know. I’ve watched telly. Need the satellite off Jupiter.”

“We’ll do what we can,” Miu said. “There’s something crawling under the frames. Could be an animal. Could be a trick of the light. Could be your monster. Do we have a monster, Mara?”

“We have a seventeen-year-old who didn’t make it home and someone who knows how to use the city when it’s asleep,” Rollinson said. “What we have is not magic.”

“Sometimes it helps to pretend,” Miu said, and went back to the screen.

Dominik had three places to sleep. None of them had proper walls. His favourite was under the arches where a little tributary coughed into the river, and the ivy made a curtain most of the year. He had stitched pockets inside his coat with dental floss and there he kept his best things: the journal; a packet of matches that had words from another country on them; a photograph of a child not smiling, edges bent; a bottlecap; a ribbon; a ring that didn’t fit any finger he had. He didn’t sleep long. He slept in slices, waking to listen between. He listened for the heavy steps of men with torches and for the lighter steps of the unafraid. He listened for the hiss of someone striking a match. He listened for songs. He didn’t like songs. The ones from phones were worst—thin, always begging.

He watched Eli walk the lane, his head pulling to the side as if a string had caught his ear. He watched patience serve him. He watched himself step out from behind a bin that was taller than he was and taller than the boy, a bin that had once been green and now was a colour pigeons invent. He had words for this moment he’d practiced, not to soothe the boy—he wasn’t foolish—but to give the world a shape. He said them in a voice that had learned to sit on top of words without really touching them.

“Down there,” he said, and pointed to the slit between the shuttered stalls, where the flour must have been laid like a breadcrumb trail. The boy, poor child, started to say something—maybe I’m late, or there’s nothing down there, or I’m not stupid—but he had a gentleman’s reflex and made space for a smaller figure to pass. A small figure that did not pass, but rose into his space instead, hand like a hook, a coil of something around his wrist. It was quick, yes, but more than quick. It was practiced. Eli’s breath left his chest in a sound like a question. No one answered.

Dominik did not love the hurting part. He did not fear it. He just set it alongside breathing and walking and the way leaves turn their faces up before it rains. He did not think of himself as cruel. He thought of himself as precise. The boy went soft sooner than some, and for a strange second Dominik felt sorry and giddy, and this combination told him that he must already be hungry.

At CID they brought in bus timetables and shoe catalogues. At CID the windows were old glass, rippled, so that the city looked as if it was at the bottom of a clear river. At CID they turned down the radio because a song had come on that somebody loved and it seemed obscene. At CID the wall with string and photographs had been taken down months ago because it made them lazy, and they had all groaned and said what are we, Americans, and then they had gotten used to their digital boards which did the same thing without the romance. Now Miu put a line on that board, danced her finger to bring up linked items, and the flour came back like a ghost. She had to scroll. They had more flour than anyone should.

“Three last winter,” Keating said, tapping the missing posters they had saved in the cloud. “Different ages. Different attitudes. All parts of the city that eat you if you let them. The flour thing got the press in a flap. The mother of one wrote a book.”

“And the one last spring that we thought was him and turned out to be a boyfriend and a bad idea,” Miu said. “What do we do when the story begins to write itself?”

“We push back,” Rollinson said. “We remember the boy is a person, not a chapter heading. We ask the pie shops who comes in buying a hundredweight of flour and won’t say why. We look at cupboards in empty places.”

They did those things. The pie shops were full of women with forearms like sarcasm and men who pretended to know how to boil water. The pie shops did not like the police because the police came in when a fight had happened and made the word pie look like evidence. But Ruiz at the stall by the canal had a story about powder on her sill, not this morning, no, a week ago, that had made her daughter think of ghosts. She had wiped it away with the back of her hand. She could wipe anything away. Except sometimes she would find a small mark left, a smudge that said: you cannot.

At Eli’s school the head teacher practiced compassion like a trick learned from a book. Kids lined the halls whispering in lower-case letters. The art teacher, a kind of exhausted fairy with a scarf, said Eli had invented a comic about a hero who couldn’t save anyone but still put the suit on. The boy’s girlfriend, Saoirse, wore orange nail polish and a face that kept refusing to become adult in the worst possible ways. Her voice came out a whisper, and she let it grow louder as each useful detail collected behind her teeth. He was scared of the underpass on Parson Road. He took selfies with strangers when he could. He liked the way chimneys looked like pencils. He had once tried to bake an apple crumble and set it on fire, truly on fire. He laughed with his head thrown back. She said the last thing he sent her was a photograph of a pigeon that had only one foot. He had captioned it hero.

Rollinson made her notes with the same pen she’d used all year. She went home that night and didn’t run but stretched and then wound herself around a bowl of spaghetti like it could catch her. She called her father in Tallahassee and let two rings go past and then three and then hung up because she didn’t know what she would say about the boy. The city’s sirens were not American sirens and still they made the same shape in the air. She lay on the floor of her living room and felt gravity insist. She dreamed of a kit bag, of a track with white lines, of someone shouting split!, which was how she learned to divide her mind and not drown.

The next morning, flour on the windowsill of a bookshop. The next morning, news of a kid who hadn’t come home the once and then had, who now swore that a small figure had watched him cut across the park. The next morning, a pie left on the fire escape of a block of flats, cooling under frost. Nobody touched it. A fox came and sniffed; the fox flinched, surprised in its own skin, and left. When the police took that pie into custody the lab could say many things. It was expertly made. It contained meat they could name and meat they could not. It contained herbs that do not grow in this climate. It contained a thread.

“Thread?” Keating said. “Like sewing?”

“Cotton. Or something like cotton,” Miu said. “Blue. One end burned. The world is a trash collage. The world is a charity shop. Our man is making it into dinner.”

Dominik rolled the pastry with a bottle he had found that was still faintly redolent of wine and somebody else’s thirty-first birthday. He whispered the steps to himself in the old tongue that had no words for grief and plenty for the weather. He lit the little stove and counted backwards from twenty. He placed his palms together and felt nothing like prayer but remembered that, once, he had seen a church choir spill into the street laughing, because they had decided the hymn would break if they kept it inside. He watched the flames through the slot and saw a moth go too close and curl like paper. He said, gently, because around fire one says gentle things, “Stay back.”

There are stories that tell you the monster is monstrous because the world made him. There are stories that say he was born from a wrong star. Dominik did not think of his origin. He thought of the way his steps changed when he went from cobblestone to mud, of the way the city had more underneath than above, of how the bones of bridges were good bones even when nobody admitted it. He thought of flights. He liked watching planes scratch white scars across the sky. They were too loud; they were awfully bright; and yet they were the only honest thing about the air. Someday, he thought. Not as a holiday. As an exit.

Rollinson walked the river alone that afternoon. She let the path tell her stories and then told them back to herself in a different order. She passed a man with a terrier who lifted its lip at her, apologizing for being alive. She passed a bench on which a woman sat, wearing a hat that was a promise she could not keep, weeping into a paper napkin, the kind they have at bakeries. She didn’t stop the woman. Some sadnesses are so tidy stopping them is an insult. She kept going. The arches widened, bridged, wavered. She ducked under a scaffolding that the woodpeckers had found and made into a percussion instrument. She saw flour. Not much. A pinch, like someone had salted the day.

She texted Miu her location. bring a box. bring gloves.

She waited a second, then another, then listened. She listened until the noise fell away and the city was simply a body asleep. And then she heard it: a little rustle that was not rodent; a very soft scrabble; the delicate sound of someone who knows how to make their presence small and is not quite succeeding.

She said, in the tone one might use with a fox or a child in a cupboard, “You’ll be hurting if you keep doing this.”

Silence settled like a blanket. She didn’t move. She let words break where they wanted to. “We’ve seen your pies. That’s a sentence I never thought I’d say. If you’re listening, you like to be good at things. Doing something again and again doesn’t make it right. It only makes you better at wrong.”

A cough, almost. Then a footstep that did not sound like a human footstep. She thought she might be frightened but found, instead, irritation, a high bright line of it, because she had met so many people who hid. She had been one herself once, when she ran to avoid explanations. She took a slow step under the arch.

“Dominik,” she said, on a whim. She didn’t know why she said it. Names are a risk. Names are a candle offered to a windy room.

A soft sound that might have been a laugh and might have been the city’s old stones resettling. “That is mine,” said a voice.

She could not place that voice—accent like a mirror taken apart, gender a thing someone had borrowed that didn’t fit, age measured in scratches, not years. “It doesn’t have to be,” she said.

Miu’s footsteps on the metal steps were an orchestra. The sound flipped the moment. The voice was gone. Rollinson reached the end of the arch too late to catch anything tidy. She did catch the scent of something like cinnamon, like kitchens on cold mornings, and she caught the more specific absence that someone leaves when they go: a cold in one shape and not others.

Shadows clothed the day. They told themselves that that hadn’t been him, that naming isn’t catching, that monsters don’t talk. They told themselves practical lies because the case needed shoes on concrete and not metaphors.

At home that night Rollinson ate toast because it is what you do when you don’t know what to do. At home that night she folded herself into bed and didn’t sleep because the boy’s face had been handed to her in pixels and she had printed it with the old printer that jams when it is anxious, and she had put the paper on her fridge with the magnet from the taxi company with the dolphin on it, and the boy stared at her as if to say: are you moving? Are you running or are you stuck?

Dominik stitched the last pocket in his coat with his teeth and the blue thread. He thought of a runway in the sky. He whispered, because whispering is a way to ride a thought without it throwing you, “Soon.”

In the morning a jogger found a pie on the steps of St. Leonard’s with steam still rising. The jogger had tasted it before she saw the note tucked under it. It was, she would tell them over and over with repentance bordering on desperation, a kind of instinct, a test of reality, like touching a radiator to see if heat is a story. The note was simple. The letters were careful children, tidy, each one trying not to touch the others.

Every feast is a sacrifice.

Rollinson took the note without gloves because she was tired of layers. She liked to feel the scab of paper under her fingerprints. She read it and wanted to give the city a shaking. She folded the note in half and then into half again and put it somewhere she could feel it against her palm.

“Feast,” Keating said, like he was tasting it and it had gone sour. “A feast of what? No—don’t answer that.”

Miu said, “He thinks he’s a god with a bad god’s sense of humour. Or he thinks he’s got to give back what he takes. Or he read a book.”

“Bring in the book people,” Rollinson said. “Bring in anyone who knows ritual without making me sit through a lecture about comparative mythology that ends in a podcast.”

“I love a podcast,” Keating muttered, and texted a man who wore a scarf year-round and would say things like liminal without choking.

They were in the precinct when the next phone call came, and for a second everything felt like it was happening quickly, like it would all be over by tea, like the world had agreed to a shape and would not wobble. A boy had been seen at the edge of the market walking with a small, slight figure in a wool cap. The boy had smiled. He had waved at the girl he liked two stalls over, who had waved back and mouthed later. He had not looked afraid. The small figure had been mostly shadow because the sun had elected to be petulant that day. The girl had thought, later, that the small figure had something wrong with his hands. The girl had thought, later, that perhaps the small figure had no shadow at all, but at the time she had been telling a joke to a friend about a teacher who used the word problematic like a hammer. The witness statements were honest. They were also useless.

Metadata started to pile. The flour they took from the scenes had a mineral signature that the lab thought might come from a specific old mill. The bus routes formed a ring like some obscene halo. The shoes they thought they were following were not shoes at all but something else: foot coverings, adapted, cut down. Dominik was making a life as he made pies. He was at his most dangerous when he was patient.

At midnight, Rollinson stood on her balcony and watched a plane cut a line. She thought of gates. She thought of exits. She thought of the way, at a meeting she had been too tired to perform at, some child in an office had mentioned private aviation as if it were a weather system. Private planes. People who lived in the air. People who could leave.

“What are you seeing,” she asked the empty air, and the empty air, polite, said nothing.

It rained. The rain tried to be meaningful and failed. The city lapped at their ankles. The police came and went, came and went, a tide of fluorescent jackets. The journalists began to write their adjectives. The families rolled the word missing on their tongues until it cracked and broke.

And through it a small man in a too-long coat, with flour in his hair, moved. If you saw him, you forgot him in the kind way; you thought: odd, and then you thought: shopping, and then you thought: home. He walked with his head down as if the sky had offended him. He watched the way people cut their day into bits and tried to choose the bit where they were least defended, and he made himself a knife for that.

He held one more thing in his coat pocket now, a small key with a leather fob. He had stolen it from a jacket on the back of a chair, and the jacket had belonged to a man who thought he had been set above the rain, a man who would speak to his driver the way someone speaks to a phone. Dominik didn’t know what the key would open. He liked keys that suggested doors.

On her third morning without sleep, Rollinson returned to the river, to the arch, to the place where she had said a name. She wore running shoes and kept her hair down as if that made her more part of the air. She put her hands in her pockets to look like she had given up. She walked like she was thinking of sandwiches. She waited for the click in the dark that meant someone had taken the bait of ordinary. She waited like an athlete at the blocks, listening for the gun she couldn’t see. She waited for a hum from overhead, something like a promise. She waited and thought of Tallahassee under heat, the track a loop of mercy, where when you ran and ran you returned to exactly where you had begun, and somehow this was the point.Chapter 2

By the time the light decided to behave like light again, the river had put back on its ordinary jacket and the arches had become simply arches. Rollinson walked out from under the dripping ivy with her hands already pale from damp stone, and she told herself that the small scrape she had heard was rats, that the small scrape had been herself moving her own breath around her rib cage, that the small scrape had been a thought getting up and leaving quietly so as not to wake the others. Keating waited by the railings and passed her a paper cup of coffee that tasted like a dare. She drank it because there are rituals that make the morning bearable, and among them is accepting something you don’t want from someone who would sit with you in a ditch.

“You look like you didn’t sleep, and then you didn’t sleep again,” he said, which meant he had done the same and wanted to be first with the confession so that she didn’t have to say it.

“The arches have a noise,” she said. “It’s not just water. It’s like the city is learning to breathe through its throat.”

“I’ll put that on the whiteboard,” he said, but his mouth made the shape it made when he admired her and wanted her to stop being as difficult as she was. “Miu’s got something on the flour. It’s not Tesco Basics. There’s a mineral signature. She says if she has to say the words mineral signature to me one more time she’ll quit and start a jam company.”

They walked back the long way, letting the bridges take them. The city was yawning and putting on its noise and its cigarette smoke and its too-loud laughs that said: look how alive I am, I am not frightened. A lorry backed up with the beep that goes straight to the heart of your nerves and sits down there with a lunchbox. Somewhere a bus driver was swearing because a cyclist had shouted at a taxi and the taxi had decided to make it his problem. They were all hot-blooded animals in a maze pretending to be an idea.

In the lab, Miu had drawn circles around the findings not because circles help but because circles are a way to make something feel held. “Old mill,” she said, before they could ask. “Not a brand, not modern processing. Less bleaching. There’s a calcium profile that tells me our baker is buying local, but not from anywhere you can tap your card at. There’s a place upstream, half an hour out, that got turned into a community space with a café that calls everything heritage on the chalkboard. They run classes for toddlers in the mornings where they let them touch things they’ll never be allowed to touch again, and on Thursdays a group of men who don’t like their wives meet there to pretend to refurbish chairs.”

“Men without wives meet everywhere to not refurbish everything,” Keating said. “Tell me the hours. Tell me the deliveries.”

“The mill takes deliveries Mondays and Fridays. There’s a side door that opens onto the towpath. The manager is called Lesley and has decided to be patient with all of us in advance. She’s waiting for you with a biscuit she will say is ‘naughty’ as if the biscuit will blush.”

Rollinson set her palm on the counter as if to steady herself against a next step she already knew would be a step and not a leap. The note lay there too, in a plastic sleeve that made it look like a relic. Every feast is a sacrifice. The careful letters were beginning to be a kind of face. If you stared, you could see where the pencil bit into a stroke a little too hard; you could think of a hand that had paused, thought better of a loop, and begun it again. She thought of school handwriting sheets, lined like prison bars so you learn not to stray. She thought of St. Leonard’s and the way the jogger had pressed her palms together after admitting to eating something that did not belong to her, a little prayer to the god of clean consciences, patron saint of the folk who mean no harm and have lived long enough to find out that meaning no harm is not a bulletproof vest.

The scarf man arrived because Keating always got what he asked for and always regretted it. Dr. Niall Broughton came in already talking, three scarves around his neck like medals, and his eyes lit up when he saw the note as if he’d been handed cake. “St. Leonard,” he said, before they could sit him down. “Patron of captives, of women in labour, of the unjustly imprisoned and the justly imprisoned too, if you ask the right nun. Not the patron of bakers. That would be St. Honoré, who has a halo shaped like a brioche if you look at the right paintings. But our boy leaves his line at a different church. Every feast is a sacrifice. It’s a modern aphorism pretending to be ancient. But it’s got the shape of old things. Feasts in the old world were about being seen. You fed people so they knew you had enough to feed people and still live. You slaughtered something you loved—fat calf, lamb without blemish—and told the sky: see how I offer what hurts to offer. If your man thinks he gives back when he takes, he’s making a very poor bargain in a religion he wrote himself and has no priest for. And if he leaves it at St. Leonard’s he is telling you he knows what it is to be caught or to catch. He is telling you he loves a lock.”

“How much of that is theatre,” Keating said, dry. “How much of that is a man who writes a podcast with the word liminal in it three times per episode.”

“Oh, it’s all theatre,” Broughton said, delighted. “He’s making you look where he wants you to look. But the theatre tells you what props he had access to. People who talk about sacrifice have read enough to be dangerous. Or they had a grandmother who told them stories that were older than the country they happen to find themselves in. Either way, you have a man who likes an audience and would very much like that audience to think of him as old.”

Rollinson let the man’s words run to a pool and then evaporate. Underneath, as always, was the boy. Eli’s open face was beginning to close in her mind, beginning to shy away from being looked at, as if he already knew he would be used for someone else’s shape. She hated the city when it turned into a theatre where the only people allowed to be soft were the ones in photographs. She pinched the bridge of her nose and told herself that she could put the scarf man’s sentences in a drawer in her head and open them later if they were useful, and if they weren’t useful they would make a good story for a party she was never going to go to.

Upstream, the old mill sat in a wet field and pretended it had always been loved. The waterwheel had been bolted in place so the toddlers could be photographed in front of it without losing fingers, and a blackboard announced a workshop on foraging that would, if the weather held, involve eating nettles. Lesley wore an apron that had flour ground into the ties as if someone had tried to scrub it out with a memory. She did indeed call the biscuits naughty and made Rollinson take one and Keating take two. She showed them the side door without being asked.

“Sometimes the door stutters,” she said. “The frame is old and the hinges are more suggestion than hinge. We’re supposed to keep it shut but the men who deliver the sacks prefer to shave their steps off a day wherever they can. We’ve had a rat problem this autumn. I’ve set humane traps because Jim from the council cried when I didn’t. I wipe up. The flour gets everywhere anyway. If you’re looking for footprints, you’ll find none. The whole place is a footprint.”

“There’s talk,” Keating said carefully, because talk was less loaded than crime in places where people read The Observer. “Of someone taking flour from you. Not bags walking out the door, but sweepings. Small amounts. Often enough to add up.”

Lesley nodded, once, like she had known how long it would take for this question to walk up to her and had laid out a chair for it. “There’s a man,” she said. “Small. He comes on Thursdays when the toddlers are leaving and the chair men come. He has a cap he wears even when it’s too hot and he has shoes that look like something you’d make out of something else. He asks for sweepings. He makes his lips thin like he’s embarrassed about asking. He doesn’t smell. I must tell you that. People who come asking sometimes smell of all the ways a person can fall into a hole. He smells like pockets and air. He has a way of keeping still that means you can’t stop looking at him. I gave him a dustpan of what was too far gone to bake with, and he said something in a voice that went too wide for his chest and then narrowed again. It wasn’t English. Might have been Polish. Might have been something that chose to sound like Polish. He said thank you with a care I’ve only heard at wakes. He came back the next week. There was nothing in it for me to say no. I watched him once when he thought I was bagging up sunflower seeds. He tilted his head when he looked at the flour like he was listening to it. Is he your man?”

“We’re not in the habit of saying who our man is before we know ourselves,” Rollinson said, but gently, because Lesley had given them something that was not on any form. “Did you see what he did with the sweepings?”

“Put them in a jar,” Lesley said. “A jam jar. Lid tied with blue thread. Blue like the colour you only see on silk scarves and the backs of jay feathers. He had more of the thread on a card, like the old ladies use. He cut it with his teeth. My mother would have had words about that. I nearly had words with him and then remembered I was a stranger to the man and my words would be for me.”

The blue thread stood up inside Rollinson’s mind and made itself obvious. She watched the jam jar in her head, the sweepings sliding down into it like the first snow. She watched the knot of thread done neat-tight, the way people who have always mended do their knots. She looked at the door and imagined the small figure stepping out, shoulders present before the rest of him, the towpath’s wetness a shining.

“Did he ever pay?” Keating asked, as if money had anything to do with any of this.

Lesley laughed without enjoying herself. “He left a pie on the step the second Thursday,” she said. “It was so fine I thought, I am never going to forgive myself for eating this without anyone to tell about it, so I called my sister and made her talk to me while I ate it. I have eaten in good restaurants that serve you a leaf and a sigh and charge you the price of a winter coat, and this was better than that. I had to sit down. I had to remind myself that food is for living and not for memory. Tell me if he’s killed someone with his pies. I will want to be sick with the right intensity.”

“We don’t know,” Rollinson said. “We don’t say murder until we have to. He left a note at a church. He is using the city like a map only he can read. He’s taken at least one boy and maybe others. If he comes again, don’t give him anything. Tell us instead. But don’t be a hero. If you’ve already given him sweepings enough times to make a habit, the safest thing is to look bored and do it one more time while we stand behind a sack and practice breathing.”

Lesley looked at the door and then at the waterwheel. “He made me think of the boys who used to climb in through the toilet windows and steal our charity tin when I worked at the pub,” she said. “I always wished one of them would come back and ask me for something honest so I could give it and feel the world right itself. Don’t let him make me stupid.”

When they left, the rain had decided to be theatrical again, blowing sideways so that umbrellas were a joke. Keating swore at it and then swore at himself for being surprised by English weather in England. Rollinson thought of the jam jar, of the blue thread. She remembered the lab’s thread, blue, burned at one end, carried all the way to a pie as if he worried it would unravel his day if he didn’t tuck it in. He was careful where he chose to be careful and then careless as a superstition. That was a way into someone, if you could bear the getting lost you had to do first.

Dominik counted his jars twice, then twice again, like numbers could make a fence. He liked the jam jars because they looked like something someone would keep buttons in. He liked buttons. They were small, efficient, polite. He had never owned anything with a button that did not come loose. He stored the jars under the scaffolded walkway behind the old brewery no one would admit to loving because it had killed a man with its bricks the winter of the flood. Older kids smoked there with their backs to the river. They left behind bottles and kisses. They did not see him because he was a habit no one had yet learned. He thought of Lesley with the flour on her fingertips and the way she had given him sweepings the way a woman might give a child’s coat to a charity shop, reluctantly and because the sleeves do not fit anymore. He had tied the thread with his teeth because there were not enough knives in the world, and because sometimes you have to put your own body between you and what the world might do.

The key in his pocket was heavy for its size. The leather fob was cracked and embossed with the name of a company that said its name like a prayer: Skybridge. He had liked the way the man had said it when he took the call, the contempt for distance, the fondness for the idea that you could be above anything if you had enough money to be rude to gravity. The driver had put the jacket on the back of the chair in a bar where the whisky glasses were squares for men who wanted their lips to feel educated. Dominik had stood under the coat rack and looked at the sleeves and thought: this is not a sleeve, it’s a tube for pretending to be human. He had put his hand in the pocket and the key had come out like a fish. He had felt, for a second, watched by something without eyes. He had not put the key back.

He walked to the perimeter fence of the small city airport that believed itself to be grand because once a footballer who cheated on his wife had stood there with his hand to his brow and said to a camera: it’s good to be home. The fence had three padlocked gates and one gate that was seldom used because it opened onto a bit of tarmac where nothing much parked anymore. The key was not for any of these locks, but he liked feeling its face between his fingers, the way the teeth asked to be understood. He walked the fence to where it met water and looked at the slick grey of the runway as if it already had his footprints on it. He imagined the door he would find, low and not the one anyone important used, with a lock that liked this metal better than it liked other kinds. He imagined a plane lit up inside like a lantern. He imagined the first step, not up or down but away, and the thrill that he did not have to strap himself into it forever, just long enough to go.

In CID, the day collected small indignities the way a ship collects barnacles. Reporters called and asked if they could film outside the school and then filmed outside the school when told not to. A man rang with a tip that turned out to be a grievance against a landlord that had simmered long enough to trick him into thinking it was a conspiracy. Carmen Drummond came and stood with her hands on the table and said, “I brought the drawings he did when he was little in case that helps,” and everyone said, “Of course,” and the drawings helped mainly by making everyone hold their breath. Saoirse sent Rollinson a voice note she had recorded three times before sending; in the first two versions she cried, and in the third she did not. “He sent me a message,” the girl said. “It’s not him. I mean, it is his account, but it’s a photo of the bridge like from the deck underneath, like where the skateboarders go, and it says: feast day. He never uses words like that. He uses ‘fit’ for everything. He is not suddenly a monk. And the way he wrote the letters? He doesn’t write like that. It’s careful like a teacher’s pet.”

They pulled the IP, because that is what you do before you get furious. The signal bounced through three routers and then gave them a café on a corner where the sockets don’t work. They pulled the footage and watched a cap and a coat sit in a corner with his back to the wall and his face inside the hood. They watched the careful way the hand moved on the keyboard, not because it was certain but because it was unsure. They watched him leave without looking up, like attention itself could give him away.

Rollinson stood in the doorway of the interview room and watched the tea stain spread on the table and disappear because that is what paper towels do: they participate and then they don’t exist. She thought of the river under the clatter of the café, of the careful letters, of Eli’s name in someone else’s mouth. She wanted to say words you can’t say in uniform. She wanted to break something that would make the right sound.

The plan they made was not clever. Clever gets people dead. They put eyes at the mill on Thursday and eyes at the arches at dusk and eyes at the café from noon until the sockets stopped being sockets and became holes where you put hope and wished. They put a boy-shaped figure where a boy-shape had been taken, because the city isn’t magic but it is lazy, and habits will walk a person back to the place they broke. They put a PCSO in a hoodie and made him talk to his phone as if he loved it. They made sure nobody thought they were listening. They practiced being bad at their jobs publicly so they could be good at them under the table.

Rollinson took the arches. She did not put herself at the centre because the story should not be about her, but she could not resist the way the place sounded inside her chest. She stood with her hands in her pockets and thought about doing nothing. She thought about Tallahassee, the way she had learned that doing nothing on the track is not nothing, it’s waiting for the gun. She let her shoulders drop, and by letting them drop she let the city think she had stopped listening. She did not stop listening. She heard the rattle of a bicycle with a card in the spokes because someone’s father had remembered how to make that sound and wanted his son to know it. She heard the shifted breath of a man about to say the wrong thing on his phone. She heard a fox cough, which is what they do when they are embarrassed by the way they exist.

Then she felt it, not a sound but a subtraction. It was like a pocket being turned inside out. Someone had moved into the space where her shadow was, and her shadow had agreed to be moved. She did not turn her head. She said, in the tone of someone speaking to a person who might decide not to jump if you do not make the jump your business, “You’ve used the boy’s voice. Don’t do that. You have your own.”

“There is nothing of mine that the city did not choose first,” said the little voice behind her. “Even the name you said to the air and thought it was a trick. You do not get to ask me to be anything but a street that goes where it goes.”

“If the city chose you,” she said, “then you’re bad at choosing back.”

He made a small amused sound, the kind someone makes when they find a knife where they expected a spoon. “You are too tall,” he said. “You can never see under things.”

She turned her head, and he was there, nearer than the second before, small enough that he could be at her elbow and not brush it. He was tidy, or thought himself tidy. The coat was a dictionary of other people’s days. The cuffs were a history lesson. His face was one of those faces that refuses to be framed by light, so that you remember a line of a cheek and the flat, careful mouth and the eyes that placed themselves before they were placed. He was younger than the old story and older than the boy’s story. He held himself like a child who has been told to stand in a corner and made the corner an altar.

“You are Dominik,” she said, because if there was any sanctity to a name it would be in using it without an edge.

“It is a word that does not embarrass anyone,” he said. “It is not a thing that men throw. You said it like you found it in your pocket. You keep a lot in your pockets.”

“You keep a lot in your coat,” she said, and watched the flicker in his hand where a key might be. “Give me the boy.”

He made a face that didn’t quite arrive at being human. “I cannot give what you think I have,” he said. “And the things I have are all things the city gave me and then decided I had stolen. Your boy is a song. He will end where he is supposed to end.”

“Don’t talk to me about songs,” she said, with a heat that made the arches breathe differently. “Don’t talk to me like nothing matters and it’s all weather. Say a straight thing.”

“I do not like straight things,” he said. “Straight things are for tracks. I like tunnels.” He tipped his head, listening to something that might have been her pulse. “Do you run to chase or to be chased?”

“Both,” she said. “Give me the boy.”

He blinked, slow, either to be rude or because he had to think. “He is not ready,” he said. “You cannot take a pie out of the oven before it is a pie.”

She moved, then, in a way she had trained into her muscles so that they would do it even if she didn’t believe in her own speed. Her hand went for his elbow and found the empty of air, because he moved like water under a bridge. He was not fast in the way of fast men on tracks; he was fast like a thought you do not like, that slides away even as you try to say: stay still so I can look at you. He slid around her and into the dark of the arch where the ivy thickened and the brick turned to damp. She went after him and found the place he had been and the heat he had risked describing him. He had gone low, not up. She saw the gap under the scaffolding where a child would not fit and a grown man would not think to look. She dropped to her knees and crawled, hood snagging on a nail, palms sliding in the slick of something that might have been old oil or the city’s blood. She came up on the other side bleeding from a dozen honesty cuts and with her hair full of spider.

He was not there. He was not anywhere. He had done the fox’s trick and become a sentence that was finished before it began. She stood and swore and threw her glove at the water and watched it float because latex is a liar. Then she heard the whistle. It was not for her. It was for the boy in the hoodie at the top of the steps, who had become suddenly, conspicuously boy-shaped. The whistle came from Keating, and the boy shrank into a laugh because a detective pretending to be a kid at dusk can only be one thing until he is everything he is and none of it is a boy.

“Gone,” she said, when she reached him. “He is a hole that moves.”

The boy-PCSO, whose name was Aamir and who was brave enough to go home and tell his mother he had sat in a cold place for a daughter who wasn’t hers, said, “He was near you. I could hear it. Like a radio tuned between stations. How old is he? He sounds like he’s all ages at once.”

“Older than the good version of any of this,” she said. “You did fine.”

In the bakery by the river, pigeons moved in their slow gossip and the mixers gleamed with a film that would never come off. Under the tile where the journal had lived, the empty was very clean. Dominik had come the night after she had said his name under the arches and had looked at the tile and thought: nothing holy stays where you can point at it. He had taken the book and moved it twice and then once more for luck and put it in the place where the river tunnels forget to tell you they are tunnels. He had turned one page and read a list of ingredients that were also streets and felt a little foolish, the way anyone would if they saw their own handwriting and knew it for what it is, a spell you convince yourself is a recipe. He kept writing because the work was the work. There was not much else that was honest.

He had gone to St. Leonard’s because he had liked the letter on the sign outside. He had liked the way L is a door if you draw it thicker. He had left the pie because he believed in payment. He had watched from the scaffolding of a building that had never learned its own name as a woman bent and then straightened and then put something in her mouth before she read the words he had left her. He had felt, for a second, as if something gentle had happened in the middle of something that could not be gentle. He had let that feel be there, like a lamp you do not trust.

At the airport perimeter, a man in a neon vest counted keys and told himself the number did not matter. He was tired in the way of people who stand in places where nothing happens until suddenly everything does. He told his supervisor the key had gone missing last week, but he had thought it would show up because things do. He said it had a brown fob and a number stamped on it, and the number meant a door that nobody used except the men who liked to feel useful. He said he would find it. He thought of his son’s school photograph and the way the boy had accidentally made his own hair into an event. He put the thought of the key somewhere he could reach later and went to tell a pilot where to park.

The next pie was left at the base of a statue of a man on a horse who had once done something atrocious and noble in equal measure and had been given this absurd pose as a consolation prize. People fed the pigeons there and got scolded by signs. People took photos of a city that did not deserve them. The pie sat steaming in its own certainty. This time there was no note. This time the crust had a pattern pressed into it with the rim of a jar. This time a girl with glitter on her cheeks took a picture and posted it and wrote: who’s doing the weird pie thing again? The picture got three hundred comments that were about hunger and art and fear dressed as wit. Miu looked at the pattern and said: jar rim, and Keating said: like a signature, like an idiot at a crime scene, and Rollinson thought: he is getting proud, and the pride will kill either him or someone he has not yet chosen.

They found the thread again, a single blue filament like a vein of sky caught in a fold. Miu slid it into a folder as if it could cut itself if she didn’t respect it. “This is cheap cotton,” she said. “It’s pretending to be something better. It’s from a shop where old women buy things to make their curtains look like the curtains they once had when the country made anything.”

“Where do old women buy thread now,” Keating said. “Do they buy it online? Do they go and be told by a teenager: sorry, we don’t stock that, try somewhere that exists only in memory.”

“There are haberdashers yet,” Miu said. “One at the covered market. One on the high road that opens when it feels like it. I’ll ask if anyone has a customer who buys blue in quantities that make them raise an eyebrow.”

Rollinson went home and set her trainers by the door and did not put them on. She leaned against the wall with her forehead because sometimes a wall is a friend that knows how to be quiet. She thought of the kid she’d been when Florida was all air so hot it forgot to be air, when she had run around the track until her coach said to stop because she looked like she loved the pain too much. She thought of splitting, of the way everything could be divided if you cut at the right angle. She thought of the boy’s mother sitting in the interview room with the drawings another day older between her hands. She thought of Dominik’s voice saying tunnels and of the blue thread in her mind like a taut line you must not pluck.

On Friday, the mill delivered flour to three bakeries and one community kitchen and only one man watched the lorry with hunger. He watched because he liked the way sacks sit, like men who know something and will not tell you until you make them a story and then they’ll tell you only to make you wrong. He watched because he did not trust the sky to keep being a sky. He watched because patience is a clean thing and he had so few clean things left. He watched because his coat had a new pocket for the key, and the pocket held the shape of his plan.

At dusk, when the market had decided to pretend to sleep, Ruiz wiped down her counter and told her daughter to stop painting her nails in the shop because the smell makes the pies taste like a salon. She thought of the dusting she kept finding on the sill and of the way she had decided to leave it yesterday, to see if it made a pattern. It had not. That bothered her the way a dream bothers you at lunchtime. She saw a small figure pass and did not see him. She reached for the light and left it off because a piece of her that she did not admit to still liked the dark. She told herself it was because electricity costs what it costs now and not because the dark keeps secrets safe if you smile at it.

Dominik did not go to Ruiz’s door. He went to the shutter of the fishmonger, where the smell carries even through metal. He took a small paper parcel from his pocket and slid it underneath, not because he had anything to say to fish but because he had something to say to the man who would find the parcel in the morning and wonder for half a day whether to throw it away or put it in his jacket and pretend it was for his wife. The parcel contained nothing but flour cut with ash, a filthy thing, a little curse, a small petty prayer. He was not proud of the pettiness. It was a way to make the city talk back to him, and he was tired of speaking into the long hallway of its throat.

Rollinson went without a plan to the church of St. Leonard and sat in the back where the candlesticks shine because someone loves them. She did not put money in the tray. She did not kneel. She listened to a choir warm up in a room she could not see. Their voices made the kind of sound that makes you think of a ceiling learning how to be sky. A woman with hair like a helmet glanced at her and then glanced away because policemen in pews are either here to arrest God or ask Him to do His job. She did neither. She put the note in her pocket on the well-polished wood and pressed on it with her index finger until the edge left a mark. She looked at the stone saints and felt nothing. She looked at the poor box and felt rage because it is always there like a joke. She left without making a noise.

On the way home she passed under a flight path and watched a plane drop into the bowl of the city. For a second, because she was tired, because she had been listening for the wrong sounds, she thought she saw a small figure on the tarmac wave at the belly of the plane. She blinked. It was a man in a high-vis vest asking a mechanic if he fancied a brew. Her mind had done the thing minds do when they are made of too many stories. She swore at herself and at the sky and at the man she could not catch. She swore because it helps, sometimes, to be vulgar into the air that cannot be offended.

At three in the morning, a fox knocked over a bin lid with a violence that made three windows light up like punctuation. Under the bridge, where the graffiti repeats itself with a rash’s insistence, Dominik lay on his side with the key in his palm and rehearsed an exit. In his head, the steps did not involve the boy except as a word he had already finished saying. In his head, the plane door was warm. In his head, the pilot had a face like a saint in a cheap painting and would look at him once and then never again. In his head, the runway became a river and the river became a runway and both meant out. He slept in slices and woke in pieces. He had patience, and patience tastes of ash when you have kept it too long.

On Saturday morning, the city gave him a gift and then tried to take it away. The gift was a man with a yacht club badge on his jacket who put his keys down on the bar and then went to the gents. The keys smelled of leather and ease. The fob said: Mooring 17. The bar smelled of disinfectant and old jokes. The two men in the corner were discussing a petition with the fervour of the deranged. Outside, rain walked sideways up the street and then down again for practice. Dominik stood, touched the keys with his index finger because sometimes you must let the future touch you, and then slid them into his pocket because keys are doors and doors are heaven. He was out the door before the man had time to remember that there was such a thing as later.

In CID the board glowed not with answers but with discipline. The shoes that were not shoes had become a strip of photographs and numbers. The thread had a column all to itself. The words St. Leonard were in a corner like a punishment. Keating drew a circle around the airport on a map and then did not show anyone because he did not want to be laughed at. Miu went to the haberdasher and asked too many questions and was told: blue is for boys’ jumpers in the old way, dear, and she wondered which boys and which old way and whether you could knit a ladder out of the past and climb it. Rollinson put her trainers on and took them off again. She called her father and let it ring and let him answer and then said nothing for so long that he said her name the way someone says your name when you are a child and have fallen and are deciding whether to cry. She said she was fine and he said he believed her and they both knew they were telling the best lie they could manage today.

On the river, a mooring chain shook as if remembering. On the market, a shutter rattled because shutters rattle. On the city, a plane drew a white line like a stitch. On the road, a woman watered geraniums with a kettle and looked up when she had the sensation she had been included in something. On the arches, a woman with a runner’s lungs waited for a sound that was not rats and would not, by being named, get any easier to bear. And under the concrete, in a place where the air kept secrets because no one ever asked it not to, a small person in a coat meant for a bigger life practiced patience like prayer. He said the word Florida once, because he had seen it on a T-shirt in a photograph of the inside of a teenage boy’s phone, and he liked the way the word had sun in it, and he liked to rub his tongue on new shapes. He said it again, softer, and then he put his tongue back where it could not hurt him. He went back to counting the steps between one door and another and how fast a person can be when even the floor wants to keep him.Chapter 5

At low tide the river’s edges showed the city where its ribs were. The mud pulled back and left impressions of small lives—bird feet, a bottle, the suggestion of a chair that had decided not to be a chair anymore. The marina woke before its owners did, a clockwork of halyards knocking and ropes thinking about rubbing through. Mooring 17 took the sky in and gave it back dull. The man who rented it imagined his life as a story with varnish; the boat imagined nothing. The lock box by the gate had the kind of code a person uses for everything, the kind that begins with a date and ends with a hope. The new key slid into the scale of the marina’s day with a confidence that was arrogance pretending it was muscle memory. It turned without complaint. The gate let in a small figure with a coat that had seen seasons and decided not to change with them.

Dominik walked as if someone had taught him not to teach the ground anything. He counted cleats like a rosary. He read names written in paint like bad secrets: Perseverance, Molly B., Skye’s the Limit. He watched his breath and made it slow. He let the held boats see him. He let their indifference do its work. He stepped onto the narrow boards that call themselves pontoons when they are made to be polite and found the rhythm of their give. The boat at 17 had lines that had been tied by someone who had been told they were clever when they were fourteen and could still tie a tie with their eyes shut. The padlock on the stern locker held back nothing of consequence. He could smell diesel and last summer and the particular clean of soap used by men who only wash things they can claim. He felt for the second set of keys in the locker and found them tucked inside a lifejacket that would never be worn; he had already opened a door and was greedy for the next.

He did not take the boat out. Not yet. He was not ready to be watched by the water that way. He placed instead a parcel in the locker and locked it again. He touched the rope ends with his fingertips, not for luck. He watched the reflection of himself bend, split by a duck that passed wearing its own implacable. He whispered the word he had learned the night before because he liked the taste it left, a taste like stale sugar: Tallahassee. The water didn’t answer. Water had better things to do than learn American.

At CID the light did what light does—found the surfaces that would lie for it and ignored the ones that wouldn’t. Keating put down two coffees and took off his scarf and put it back on again because in this building temperature was a kind of religion and he had chosen the wrong sect. Rollinson stood by the board like it had said something rude about someone she loved. The blue thread had its own column. The photograph of a pie looked like a galaxy from a camera too bored to be specific. Miu had put more circles around the flour and then more again because repetition can be a charm, and not all charms need to be pretty.

“Haberdasher,” Miu said, austerely proud, as if she were about to produce a rabbit from the evidence cupboard. “Covered market one, the old one that sells dried beans in jars like you’re somebody’s grandmother. Woman with a voice that could sand furniture. She says she hasn’t sold out of that particular blue in months because no one wants to mend things blue anymore. But she’s ordered a packet once a fortnight for a man who buys two cards and sometimes three, always in cash and always with coins that don’t agree with each other. He stands just so to keep the light off himself. He always asks if she has recycled jam jars, and once she said no to see what he’d do and he looked like he might lick the counter. Next time she gave him a box half full and he paid her like she had sold him a crown.”

“Did she say what he calls himself,” Keating said, and the hope in his voice was a feather from a bird that had fallen out of its tree.

“She says he said thank you with a break in the middle like the word had a hill,” Miu said. “And he said he’d be back Thursday. He was back Thursday. He bought thread and said, in a voice like a speech that forgot it was a speech halfway through, ‘for the pocket,’ and smiled at it like he enjoyed congratulating himself for nearly lying. He had a cap. He is smaller than me. He is not smaller than himself.”

“We can put eyes there,” Keating said. “We can put eyes everywhere. We can stitch the city to him and pull. The thread cannot just be about his bloody hem.”

“It’s not about the hem,” Rollinson said, voice stepped down because if she didn’t step it down it would run. “It’s about the way he thinks things stay put if you knot them enough. It’s about doors, and he’s making them in fabric because wood would be too easy to see.”

She didn’t say what she had written in the small notebook she hadn’t told anyone about, the one that accreted in corners of her bag like silt: He ties up the day so it doesn’t unravel. He speaks to the city like to a dog who isn’t his. He eats patience and calls it bread.

At nine, Ruiz phoned the station not because she had faith in the police but because she was a practical woman and practicality is a kind of love. “There is a thing,” she said to whoever answered, and the thing turned out to be a parcel wrapped in brown paper and tied with—yes—blue thread, left under the lip of her stall’s shutter like a sick joke. Rollinson went with Keating and two other bodies in coats that used to feel authoritative. The parcel sat like it had been told to sit. Miu arrived breathless with a box of the right size and with gloves she’d warmed under her jumper because sometimes it helps, the small thought that your hands won’t suffer. They opened the parcel with a carefulness that was more about courtesy than evidence. Inside, flour had been folded into paper like winter folded into sky. And inside the flour a smaller package, the size of a sandwich you make for a child you love. Inside that, a pie tin with a crust scored with the rim of a jar. Inside that, a pie. She could smell meat and thyme, burnt sugar, the clean of something that had been washed too much. Keating swore under his breath, a short, taut word that said he wished he believed in hexes so he could blame one.

Miu made a sound that was almost a laugh because the trick had been well done, and when things are well done the world is sometimes better briefly no matter how wrong the content is. She put the pie in the second box and the box in the bag and marked the bag with the date and the time and the place like a charm against forgetfulness. A uniform lad with kind, terrible eyes asked if he could have the paper. Rollinson shook her head and then nodded because the paper might carry a print and because the boy’s hands needed to do a thing or they would start patting their own fear. He folded the paper like it could fold his morning.

Carmen Drummond came in carrying a parcel too, small and battered, because the world had decided to make a motif of wrapping. It had been on her doormat when she went out to ask a neighbour for sugar and realized she had no shoes on. The neighbour had stared at her bare feet like they were a kind of crime. Carmen had taken the parcel up with the care of a woman lifting her child the day he is taller than she is. She had brought it here because the last time she opened a thing without a detective in the room she had found receipts for her ex-husband’s trip to Greece hidden under the lambswool jumper she had bought him for the anniversary he forgot. She set the parcel on the table and took a breath like a diver. It held a guitar pick. The pick was orange and had a cartoon ghost on it because Eli thought ghosts were the only dead you could be and still go to school. There was a note. It was not the careful hand that had written the sentence for the church. It was a mess, a scrawl, the letters stepping on each other like kids in a corridor.

hero.

Carmen put her head in her hands, not because she had decided to cry but because sometimes you must let the world become dark in a small way or the big dark sees you and decides to do the rest. Rollinson touched the woman’s elbow and felt the way bone makes a person noble when nothing else does. She thought of the pie in its box. She thought of the blue thread. She thought of the way her own hand had written the boy’s name yesterday and had made the R and the O big, a child’s hand, her hand, betraying her.

In the corner office where they brought in strange men with degrees and scarves, Dr. Broughton pronounced the word threshold and looked pleased with himself when Keating did not groan. “Do you know,” he said, “that the word comes from thresh, from the grain, from the place where a thing is separated from itself. We put thresholds between rooms so you can cross without carrying the chaff. You are dealing with someone who enjoys thresholds. Arches, markets, marinas, airports; places where people move from one state to another and pretend they are the same. He bakes with sweepings. He ties with cheap thread dyed a sincere blue. He leaves offerings at saints who remember the unfree. He will go for a door you cannot see until you are standing in it.”

“Tell me where to stand,” Rollinson said, not unkindly. “Tell me where my feet go so that when he tries for the next door I am there with my hand and a lawful sentence.”

“The mill was true,” he said. “The church a flourish. The marina a classic because water is the oldest threshold. The airport is not romantic to you; it is to him. He will be at the edge of it, not where the men with briefcases can swagger, but where the tarmac breeds with the world. He will use a maintenance door that everyone forgets. He will like a thing that suggests the sky chose him, even if only for a minute.”

After, when the man had left and his scarf had been remembered by the hook and decided it would not leave of its own accord, Rollinson drew a circle around the airport on the map and did not feel foolish. “He has a key for something there,” she said. “He had a key for the marina because humans leave keys like breadcrumbs. He leans on found things because he does not have the kind of confidence money buys. He steals a door because he has never had one with his name on it.”

“We can get the airport to play friendlier,” Keating said. “They’ll flip out at the risk assessment like it’s a poem. We can stand men in high-vis and pretend we can see small things in big spaces. We can ask the lad in Security with conscience to count how many keys he’s pretending not to have lost.”

Miu slid into the doorway and didn’t bother with prefaces. “The pattern on the pie rim,” she said. “It’s a jar, yes. But not the current jar. It’s an old Rose’s jam jar, the ones with the ridges closer together. They don’t sell those anymore. The covered market sells them secondhand for people who like to put pencils in nice things. The haberdasher had none. But the woman at the stall opposite had three stacked. She says a small man bought them last month and asked if she had any more. And he came back with a ring that he said didn’t fit anyone he knew and asked if she’d swap it for jars. She told him she doesn’t do swaps for sentiment and he smiled like his face had never learned where smiles end. She didn’t swap. He bought the jars with coins that had boats on them.”

“He is bartering with the past,” Keating said, and then pulled a face at himself. “He is bartering with people who think they are the past. I’ll get her to describe the ring.”

“She did,” Miu said. “It had a flat top. It was a man’s ring, cheap, with a letter nobody in her family has ever had. A D, she thinks. Or an O. Or, and this is where she gets mystical, a letter that was once a letter and then burned a little and turned into something else.”

In the hour between four and five when thought gets caught in the machine, Rollinson took herself to the arches not to stalk but to listen. The river was at his quietest—he was on the inhale. She leaned on the brick and thought of a childhood in heat. She thought of lanes that run straight because land is cheap. She thought of tracks and how you can run around the same circle all evening and never repeat a moment. She thought of the boy and his guitar pick and the word hero scrawled like someone trying to write on a car window in winter. She thought of Eli’s girlfriend Saoirse being brave in the small way of people who still have their baby fat while they grieve. She thought of Dominik’s voice, the way he likes tunnels, and decided she hated everyone who had ever told a child they were a tunnel.

Under the market the pigeons had developed a sense of theatre. They flew up when a man entered, not because they feared him but because they loved their own noise. The man in the too-long coat ran a hand along the edge of a mixer and felt the cold like a reprimand. He had come to write three lines and to stand them up like men at a bus stop. He wrote in his journal between the jars of sweepings and the bottlecap and the ribbon and the ring he had not swapped and the photograph of a child who refused to be happy on command. He wrote: Thursday—Lesley. Friday—Ruiz. Saturday—17 and the door for planes. He wrote: St. Leonard has had enough. He wrote: blue, always blue, because blue is the piece of sky you can carry. He did not write the boy’s name because he did not want to teach the paper to say it, and paper remembers if you are not careful.

Eli’s world had shrunk to the size of a smell. He could smell damp, and flour, and the iron in his own blood where he had bitten the inside of his cheek to see if he could make something of his own in the space he had been given. He had once learned in a terrible poetry lesson that flour is like snow and that comparing everything to snow is weak, and he had laughed with the other boys and drawn the teacher in his book with a speech bubble that said snow is just flour the sky forgot to bake. He thought of that now and almost laughed and made himself not laugh because laughter shuffled the air and air was a currency. He had a song in his mouth that his hand would know if he were allowed to touch strings. He had the picture of a pigeon in his phone in his head because the phone itself had been taken and might as well be an ocean away. He had the word hero because he had written it once to a girl and now it had come back like a dog. He tried the other word in his mouth—Florida—because the small man had said it and because he wanted to make the sound of sun. When he said it it tasted like rust.

He was in a space that had once been a space for something useful. He had told his mother he hated the dark and she had bought him a little plug-in light with dolphins. He hated himself for having told her the thing about the dark. He hated the dark for making him have to tell it. He thought of his mother’s hands on a mug. He thought of telling her the underpass on Parson Road scared him because it smelled like spit. He thought of telling the small man with the coat to stop making food out of people. He had been given water. He had been given a scrape of something that had once been food and was now just chewy. He had not been hidden in the kind of way that made him think he had a future. He hoped anyway, like an idiot, like a boy, like a human.

On Thursday, they set the haberdasher up like a stage. The woman with the sandpaper voice had agreed with a good humour she did not mean because if a story is going to tell itself in your shop you might as well profit. The market rolled up its shutters and put on its faces. The stall with the thread looked innocent. The stall opposite with the jam jars pretended it had never met a pie. The woman who sells thyme and the woman who sells apologies arranged their pots. Miu stood near a barrel of lentils and practiced appearing to read the labels backwards. Keating wandered with a paper bag of fudge that made children look at him like he might be an uncle worth knowing. Rollinson stood where the light turned everything into a poor photograph and did breathing exercises she had taught herself after Florida to make herself smaller without shrinking.

He came at ten when the toddlers had paint on their elbows and men had become serious about their aimlessness two shops down. He came with his cap low and his coat shut, the cuffs a history. He came moving the way he always moved, like someone had told him once to take up less space and he had said: very well, but I will choose which spaces. He held a card with blue thread like it was a book, as if the holes in the card were letters he could read. He asked the haberdasher for two more cards and she said she had three and he said three then, like he had surprised himself with his own good fortune. He put coins on the counter; they were clean and old and wrong and the right kind of wrong. He took three jars with the old ridges and checked the rims like a man checking a priest’s hands. He cut a piece of thread with his teeth and tied the jars together like a mother crossing the road in a story. He did not look at anyone and he looked at everyone because that is how you survive if you do not trust one strategy.

Two uniforms walked past with their shoulders turned to him out of theatre. Keating took a step he had practiced to look like he had thought of the step only then. Miu lifted her chin because this helps with every kind of dominance. Rollinson did the thing she had learned was the only thing that worked on children, foxes, and men in rooms. She spoke to him without making sound travel.

“Dominik,” she said. “You are late.”

He paused because patience likes to be acknowledged. He turned his head a fraction because turning your head is the kind of concession even proud men like to make; it lets them think they are setting the terms. He did not smile. He did something with his mouth that pretended it was not a smile. “You keep the name,” he said. “I keep the thread. We will see who makes a better knot.”

“Give me the boy,” she said, and admired herself in a vicious second for not using his name, for not handing the man the sound that would tell him where to hurt.

“You must stop asking,” he said. “When you ask, the city hears you and it gives the opposite. You do not understand this place. You run in circles and call it meaning.”

“You walk in holes and call it faith,” she said. “This is a market. Men and women stand in the open and show what they made. You are a thief with better manners than some.”

He made the face again that was not a face. “I am a baker without a kitchen,” he said. “I am a recipe without the pot. I am a—”

“Man with a plan for a door at the airport,” she said, and enjoyed the way his eyes did something involuntary, a flicker, a recoil she wouldn’t have guessed he had left.

There was a second then when things could have gone one way or another. One way meant he would step into the light and be floodlit by other people’s decisions; the other way meant someone would bleed without being sure whose blood it was. The city sneezed. Someone dropped a box of courgettes that shouldn’t be in season and shouldn’t be in this country and created a ridiculous carnage. A toddler saw his chance and made a run for a tower of tins. A woman laughed with her head thrown back because the joke her friend had told her suddenly developed teeth. The small man found the gap that no one else would take because no one else can make their body an apology. He slid, he went, he made an absence so neat you could have framed it. Keating swore. Aamir, who was standing three stalls away with a shopping list to hold and disguise him, lunged and caught an elbow that would have been a wrist if the man had a human arm. The elbow turned in his grip like water, like a fish, like a thing that has always known how to throw itself new. The jars clinked and one cracked and something in the sound gave Rollinson hope because cracking means you have weight.

He was gone before anyone could dignify the attempt with the word chase. He left behind blue thread under a shoe and jam on a sleeve and a small drop of blood on the corner of the haberdasher’s counter that made the woman with the sanding voice change expression and say, to the air, “Right.” Miu put the blood into a tube with a triumph that did not reach her face and then let her face have it, because you take grace where she sits down.

They did the thing after that where everyone pretends that the plan is still a plan. They closed the market in a fashion that made the stallholders call the council and their mothers. They put up tape for a little while because tape is a way to tell yourself you have time. They let in the boy with the bin to sweep, because sweeping means claiming. They took fingerprints off the cracked jar and found a partial of a small rough hand; it did not match any of their databases because it would have been too easy if it had. They took the blood to the lab and found a type but not a name. They told themselves they would stand at the airport and the marina like saints at doors and wait for their patron sinner.

At dusk, the marina did the thing marinas do when no one is looking, which is to sigh with their chains and practice remembering being rope bridges. Rollinson and Keating took turns being cold. Aamir came and sat too and told them about the time he had chased a man over paving stones so slippery you could have skated and how, at the end of the day, the man had given him a cigarette and said he didn’t smoke and Aamir had thought: we have to give kindness somewhere or it burns a hole in us. The harbourmaster did not know he was playing a part in a story and so he played it with a convincing neutrality.

At eleven, a shadow moved where a shadow would move. It hovered like a rule. It flowed along the pontoon’s narrower bit like someone making a signature. Rollinson moved first because her legs knew how to hear the starting pistol, even in the dark and rain, even when the starting pistol was a fish belly turning under a cloud. The small figure found his gate and was surprised, properly, for one half second, to find two officers at the latch. He made for the other end. He scattered flour from his pocket because he cannot help being himself even when it would be smarter not to. The flour went up like a bad ghost. Keating breathed it and coughed and swore and laughed because the ridiculousness of it might have saved a life once.

The chase had the quality of a nightmare where speed is a suggestion. Pontoons have opinions. So does water. Rollinson took two paces for every one of his because the boards wanted her. He slid at the elbows under the arms of a man loading a crate he would tell himself he never saw. He went low where she could not go low without tearing her jacket and making her body remember that she is human and not a knife. He reached the stern locker of 17 and flipped the lid and threw out something that hit the boards and rolled and made a sound like glass negotiating. She saw the glint and thought: jar, and in the tiny place where she had room for jokes, she thought: of course. He gave up on the lock because locks have to cooperate. He stood on the swim platform and looked at the water like you look at a friend you are about to ask too much of and then he went.

He didn’t dive like a hero. He went like a thing that belongs there. He went under without dramatic. He became a sentence you cannot finish because the grammar won’t allow it. Rollinson reached the platform and crouched and peered and saw nothing that belonged to him except a handprint sliding clean off the ladder. She put her hand there and it was cold as anyone’s. Keating took the long way and met her there and asked, uselessly because he knew, “Do you see him,” and she said, “He’s doing tunnels again,” and tried not to think of lungs. Aamir went around to the other side, where the pilings chew the light. He called softly like someone calling a cat, and the water called back with the small predictable slaps of its mouth. He swore for the fourth time in his career because what is the point of having words if you cannot use them when it matters.

On the pontoon where the jar had rolled, Rollinson’s torch lit the parcel he had placed days ago, dry because the locker was dry, careful because he is careful. The parcel was the size of a promise. She opened it and found a pie so beautiful she felt something ugly grow in her because people who do ugly things should not also do beauty. Under the pie a card with careful writing, the careful writing of the first note, the careful writing of the church. Eli’s name was not on it. The sentence was: Not yet.

The harbourmaster came with a long hook, because sometimes a long hook brings you a thing you need. He did not bring them a man in a coat but he brought up a key that had been dropped because even the careful do not swim with metal without paying. The leather fob was stamped: Mooring 17. Keating looked at it with a satisfaction that was smaller than it deserved. “We take one door out of his pocket,” he said. “Let’s hope he was only carrying two.”

The airport had the kind of night lighting that pretends to be kind to the stars. The man in Security with a conscience that kept him alive by making him not speak to it went home and ate toast and stood by his window and did not know his door was waiting. The maintenance gate on the perimeter fence had a padlock with a number that had lost its paint. The door on the side of the low building where the pilots drink bad coffee while pretending to be gods had a cylinder that could be pleased by the right metal. It had a keyhole that missed the key that had loved it. It did not know the key was in a pocket in a coat tied shut with blue thread. It did not know patience.

On Sunday, a woman with a helmet of hair at St. Leonard’s lit three candles for men who had never once asked her to light a candle for them. She put a five-pound note in the poor box and thought: you are a joke and I am joking with you. The choir sang something honest. The jogger who had eaten the first pie ran past the church and spat into the drain because she had dreamed she was chewing fabric and woke with her mouth sewn shut in worry. Saoirse bleached a streak in her hair because grief is an impatience with your own face and she wanted to see if the stripe could make anything different. Carmen put Eli’s drawings in a box and put the box in the cupboard where the boiler used to be before it flaked. She dialled Rollinson’s number and didn’t press call and then she did and said nothing and then she did, and said, “I’m cooking and I need to know whether to make enough for two,” and Rollinson said, “Make enough for three,” and caught herself and said, “Make what you can bear to eat,” and hated herself for not being a better liar when a lie would have helped.

Dominik lay under the concrete with a blanket like a permission. He had a thing in his hand that was not a key and not a thread. He had the boy’s pick. He turned it over and over because he liked the way a small thing can be a universe if you let it. He knew when he had dropped the marina key because you always know, the same way you know when a person has forgiven you without speaking. He had the other key in the pocket he had stitched with blue. He had a plan for how he would stand at a door and become a line. He had jars with flour that might be enough for a last pie. He had hunger that had stopped being metaphor a long time ago. He had a city that kept not choosing him until it did in small ways. He had the worst thing, which was hope, because hope is the engine you cannot turn off without dying the wrong death.

He thought of the woman who says the name like a coin she keeps in her shoe. He thought of the way she moved like a gun in a starter’s hand. He thought of the sound of the river when it is thinking and not when it is showing off for the sky. He whispered Florida again to see if it would be different. It wasn’t. He whispered feast. He whispered sacrifice. He put the words next to each other like knives on a cloth. He closed his eyes and aimed himself, and because he was careful, because patience is the last clean possession, he did not imagine success, only the steps, only the door, only the acceptable sizes for breaths.

At noon there was a small commotion at the covered market that had nothing to do with police and everything to do with a fox that had wandered in and decided to choose, as its stage, the haberdasher’s stall. It stood with its thin coat and its arrogance and looked at the thread like it could eat history. The woman with the sanding voice clapped twice, the way you clap to make a bird leave a room without hurting itself, and the fox left, tail a punctuation. The thread swayed, blue and believing. The jars sat where they sat. The city pretended not to notice what was being built in its mouth.

By two they had an airport pass for someone who wasn’t quite one of them and a neon vest for someone who was. They had a man with a camera with a lens that can see into a lie. They had a woman with a mop because you get things done if you look like you are going to clean up after them. They stood in the part of the airport that sells coffee and the lie of departure and they waited to be bored enough to be surprised. The door with the lock that missed its key hummed with electricity in the way of doors that do not think they are anything more than polite. Tags hung from belts. Names hung in the air.

At the marina the water made a small sound against the hull of the boat that thought it was special. A child in a red jacket pointed and said, “Look, Mum, look,” and the mother said, “At what,” because adulthood is the art of losing track of pointing. At the arches the pigeons had a meeting. At the mill Lesley put her hands on a table and left flour handprints that looked exactly like a child’s nightmare of ghosts. At St. Leonard’s someone lit a candle for a man who had stolen a bicycle and never given it back and then gone to sea and braved nothing. At CID, Miu put the blue thread next to the jar rim pattern and made a line that was not evidence and still helped.

Toward evening, when light becomes a suggestion and not a promise, the door at the airport that had been waiting felt a lick of metal. The key slid home with the satisfaction of something completing its shape. The cylinder turned. The woman with the mop looked at her hands and made them look bored. The man with the camera did a very good impression of a man with a phone. The neon vest adjusted his collar and said hello to the air because that is what you say to a trap if you have been raised right. The door opened inward. The space beyond was always smaller than you think; the size of space depends on who you want to be when you enter.

He came in face first because faces like the forward. He came in coat first because the coat was as much him as the hand that turned the key. He came in with the patience he had been carrying like a loaf. He came in like a rule. He saw the mop and he saw the camera and he saw the vest and he saw the space he had been promised by the story in his head collapse in respectful silence. He did not run. He did the other thing that smart desperate beings do. He smiled.

“Dominik,” Rollinson said, somewhere between the door and the rest of her life, and the name did that thing it does which is make a shape you can touch. He looked at her and he was too many ages. He was the boy who had leaned over ovens. He was the man who had taken children by their hunger and led them to his. He was the thing that learns you and then leaves you before you can know it. He put his hands in his pockets as if that were a way back through the door that was not behind him. He took out a jar, one of the old jam jars with the ridges like words in a language you had not decided to learn. He set it on the floor by his shoe like an offering that he knew would be refused and an insult he couldn’t bear not to make. It wasn’t a bomb. He would never make a loud thing; he hated noise when it belonged to someone else. It was flour. It was always flour. He unscrewed the lid and tipped it, soft as breath. White slipped like weather. Everything that moved in that room respected the fact of dust.

“Don’t,” she said, because you always say it though it never works, and he tilted his head like a person listening for a timetable.

He went left. She went where left would be if it were her left. He used the word tunnel as a verb with his body. He found the narrow between an old refrigerator and the wall because airports keep everything you didn’t think about, stacked in the bad light. He was through it before the neon vest could put a shoulder there. He did a small hurt to himself on a metal edge and liked it because hurt guarantees you are not a story yet. He ran down a corridor that does not appear on maps. He was quick, not because he is fast now but because he has been afraid forever. He reached a door that needed free hands. He had flour on his palms that made the handle delicate. He got it anyway. He pushed into the air like it belonged to him.

He was on the edge of tarmac that had learned to sing under aircraft. He had the confusion that is righteousness and wrongness at once. He looked at a small plane with a nose that suggested it had opinions about control. He thought he could make a straight line across the wrong black to the wrong light and be forgiven by the fact of movement. He thought of Florida like a trick. He thought of the river like a runway. He thought he had never made anything that wasn’t an exit.

He didn’t see the boy with the mop step forward. He didn’t see Keating do the quiet thing with his hand that puts weight where it belongs. He didn’t see the way the man at Security had, for once, decided to look. He did see Rollinson arrive in his eye like a metronome that had turned into a person, did see the way she kept her feet where the ground had told her it would take them. He did see that the key had been used and therefore could not be used again and had the small stupid thought—one of his clean ones—that he should have left it for someone who would be kinder to doors.

She said, third time not a charm, “Give me the boy.” He said nothing because if he said nothing the city could not use his words to undo him. He did the only thing that was left that belonged to him. He sat down on the line that divides things that move from things that shouldn’t. He crossed his legs like a child at story time. He set the jar between his feet as if introducing it. He put his hands on his knees. He looked up.

He looked up and the plane above him, the one that was not his, drew a white mark and pretended to sew sky to sky. He looked up and said, in that voice that goes too wide and then finds its width, “After,” as if there were such a thing that didn’t depend on what the next ten minutes did.

Rollinson took a step. She took another. She reached into her pocket and felt the note from St. Leonard’s, the edges softened by her making it thumb-rosary. She made herself small and resisted the urge to be fast. She let the runway be an arrow and did not make herself its point. She put her hand out like a person offering a dog the back of her palm. He did not bite. He did not run. He said, of all the useless things, “I have to finish this one.”

“You’re done,” she said. “You finish it by telling me where he is. You finish it by making me sick with relief.”

He closed his eyes and opened them slower than you think eyes can. “The city eats,” he said. “It’s not my fault I learned to cook.”

“You are not a priest and this is not an altar,” she said. “He is not a lamb. Take me.”

He looked at the jar like it could answer for him. He looked at the flour on his fingers and made two small moons in it with his thumbs. He put the lid on the jar and stood up and put the jar in her hand. He did not let go. He was not letting go of anything that had been his. He took a breath. He said, and the word was the size of a room you can open any day and be drenched by: “Okay.”Chapter 7

They walked him back through the maintenance corridor in a procession that refused to look like a procession, because this was not triumph and was not yet grief, and nobody wanted to give the moment a shape it would remember. He did not fight the hand on his sleeve, and when Keating showed him the cuffs with the professional apology of a man who has spent too much of his life performing civility over metal, Dominik frowned as if the metal bored him and turned out his wrists before anyone asked, offering them like a schoolboy about to have a thorn pulled. Rollinson took the jar from his other hand and held it under her arm the way a runner holds a baton, and while she was doing that she leaned in and said quietly that if he made a move to fall between things she would make his life smaller in measurable ways. He nodded like she had told him the tides observed a schedule. He had flour in the lines of his hands that lifted in a puff when the cuff closed, and for a second the corridor looked like prayer.

He was very small in the high-vis glare, and something in the way he walked made the floor seem to give a little where he stepped, like the building had been taught to be kind to him against its will. The camera man pretended not to exist and recorded everything, including the moment when Dominik lifted his chin to see the ceiling pipes and, as if he were checking a crust, made a judgement of their age and whether they were likely to let you down. Miu had come to the door with a face that said two things at once and neither of them were “good.” She watched him like a person watching a firework going up that they know has been mis-shelled, and when he passed, she inhaled and caught the ghost of cinnamon and ash, and then let it go with an almost laugh because the mind will steal relief where it can find it.

“Take me to him,” Rollinson said when they were back in the part of the airport where you can smell fries and old sick and perfume that will end up in lost property. “We will not bargain here. You will not make me count. You will not make this a pilgrimage because I am not a saint. We go now. If he is alive, that is because he is alive. If he is dead, you will not make it a story.”

“You do not understand the dignity of the way things end,” he said, and the cuffs clicked as he gestured because he could not stop himself giving a sentence a hand to sit on. “But I accept that you will never agree with me as long as I am loud in the room. He is where the river holds its breath. Your shoes will not love it.”

Keating had the car already, the nondescript estate that smelt of wet fleece and the last place a sandwich had died. Dominik sat in the back and made himself small as if he had practiced cars when nobody invited him into one. He looked out of the window not like a passenger but like a thief memorising the city so he could return it in better condition and be praised. He did not speak. Rollinson did not look at him. The jar sat on her lap, warm now from her thigh, and she had the absurd sense that if she unscrewed the lid she could catch him in a snowfall. Keating drove with the courteous aggression of a man whose job gives him both motive and excuse. They did not run the siren because sirens are a promise you might have to keep, and they had had enough of promises.

He took them off the main road into a string of lanes with names that sound like history and look like forgetting. He asked them, very politely, to kill the engine one street before, and when Keating opened his mouth Rollinson said “fine,” because sometimes you go with the rhythm the city offers you, even when it is a song you hate. They walked the last stretch under dripping elder and the kind of ivy that has opinions. Dominik took the lead not because they let him, but because he knew where the edges were. Twice he paused to let a bus sigh past on the road above like a whale that has been given a civic duty, and once he raised his cuffed hands like a conductor to ask them to wait while a man with a dog practiced shouting convincingly into his phone. The arches took them the way arches do, unceremonious, and then they were in the parts of the river that the postcards edit out. The concrete sweated and the bricks, where they were visible, kept their secrets in the crowded quiet of mortar.

“This way,” he said, and turned sideways in a gap that looked like it had once been made for drainage and had since discovered that it had other talents. The cuffs made the turn more difficult and he grunted once, an honest sound, and Rollinson saw his mouth not be careful and felt a mean thrill like victory. He led them to a lip above a drop where water made a slow muscle, and crouched, not to hide but to talk to the floor. He told them to step where he stepped, which made Keating puff out his cheeks in dislike and then obey, because sometimes obedience is the quickest way past a man like this. They came to a place where the city had forgotten what it had built and the water remembered, an elbow in the system where things eddied and did not make the effort to leave.

He had marked the way with flour once, but the river is not sentiment and would not keep his signposts. He had done something else, and now Rollinson saw it: blue thread, not much, a whisper tied to the iron rings set in the wall, a series of thin kindnesses that showed you where the edge would take your foot if you were stupid. He had made a way that a person without his knowledge could walk and not be punished. She hated him for it and loved him for it in the same way you love a liar who keeps their lies neat. He moved under a low lintel that had once been taller and had shrunk with urban malice. He stopped in the place where the cold turned from a temperature into a policy.

“He is here,” he said, and now his voice did a thing it had not done yet in her hearing; it found a human edge and caught skin. He angled his shoulder and gave them a tunnel that wasn’t a tunnel but wanted to be, and after you knew the wanting you couldn’t unknow it. Keating went first because he is built like an apology you can trust, and because he is somebody’s father and the body knows where to put itself. Rollinson went next because she doesn’t believe rank means you shouldn’t get dirty, and she could smell now the things that had lived in this air, and she counted them with her mouth closed. Dominik stayed where he was and made himself into a bracket.

Eli’s space had been a cupboard, then a hide, then a den, then a cell because words are not neutral and the work of the city is to name until a thing stops arguing. He was upright because something in him refuses the last small capitulation. They saw him as a shape at first, and then as a boy when the torch made his face choose to be a face again. He had blue at his wrists, and it took Rollinson’s angry heart a second to understand it was thread and not bruising, because the mind loves a neat story even when it is wrong. His eyes did that animal thing when they saw light, going wide and then remembering to become human again. He did not speak until he had put his mouth around the idea of a person being there to be spoken to. When he did speak it was a whisper and it was a joke, and because jokes are what saved him with his mother and his girl he said, “Had to save the last level,” and then shivered in a long line, his body pleased with itself for remembering how.

Keating made a shape with his jacket that meant blanket and the jacket did its best. He spoke the boy’s name twice, and on the second time the boy let it find him. Rollinson cut the thread with the small knife nobody pretends to know she carries, and the thread held on like it had a personality and then it gave up because cotton knows when to stop. She tucked the ends in her pocket because evidence must be cared for as if it were a pet, and because she needed something for her hand to do that did not look like hitting a wall. Eli swayed and then set his head stubbornly on his own spine. He was thinner at the edges than the photos they had ingested. He had the kind of smell that says a person has been bravely themselves for longer than is right. He said he was “fine,” which is the word boys use when they have invented a pain scale and decided it begins at one hundred.

“What did he give you,” she asked, and wanted to bite the words back, because this isn’t for here, this isn’t for now, but he surprised her by answering like a person doing a small job well.

“Water,” he said. “And this… pastry bit. Like he’d cut the crust off something and… and a thing that had meat once, but it didn’t taste like the meat my mum buys. He said I could have the song if I wanted, and I said no because I’d cry if I sang, and he said he wasn’t trying to make me cry. I don’t think he wanted me to like him.” He looked beyond her shoulder, and she flinched because she thought the boy would look at the cuffs and become something she could not fix. He did look at the cuffs. He did not go hollow. He said, very carefully, as if he might drop the word, “Thank you,” and the shape of it broke her in a useful way.

They got him out by reversing the order the fear had gone in. He held onto Keating like they had agreed to it. He put his bare feet where Dominik had said the floor forgives you. He made a noise when the cold got personal, but it wasn’t complaint, it was punctuation. The space behind them did not approve of being left and tried to persuade them by means of damp and the suggestion of a rat. They did not listen. They came into air that had been breathed by hundreds that day and could spare some easily. Eli looked up for the first time and saw the river and said a word that was not a word anyone could write down. He clung to it anyway, and when Keating asked him if he could walk the boy nodded with a sincerity that would kill you, and then did, his knees making a case and his heart deciding in their favour.

Paramedics arrived at exactly the minute that tells you the city has decided to allow sense. They did the thing that looks like theatre but isn’t: the blanket, the check, the question, the bottle lifted and sniffed and approved because the body isn’t petty when it is honest. The older of the two said he’d had this lad in Thursday for a sprain because he’d tried to jump three steps at once, and if the world has a sense of humour it is rarely funny to the people in the middle of the joke. He asked Eli his name and Eli didn’t hesitate, and asked him the date and Eli cheated and read it on the paramedic’s watch and got away with it. They moved him to the stretcher as if they were all in a ballet that had cost the nation a lot of money to rehearse. Saoirse would later burst into noise when she saw him again because she hadn’t rehearsed anything at all and that’s another kind of honesty.

While that was happening, while relief made idiots of everyone, while someone said, “He’s okay, he’s okay,” and made the lie true by saying it enough, Rollinson stepped back into the arch’s throat and stood next to Dominik. He had kept his place like a bookmark. Water had reached his cuffs and made them shine. He was watching the piece of river that acts like a mirror until it remembers it is a road. He lifted his fingers to his face and came away with flour where he had scratched at himself thinking, and the sight of it nearly undid her because even now, even now, he could not help but be himself.

“You took him,” she said. “You fed him like a pet, you set the terms, you made a ritual out of fear. Do not say you saved him by letting him live long enough for me to find him. Do not say sacrifice like it’s a word the city will clap for. You will tell me the others. You will tell me what you made and what you buried and where. You will give me names for families to say without having to look down.”

He was quiet for the length of a single rain deciding whether to fall. When he spoke, he did not say feast or god or tunnel. He said, thinly and without theatre, “Not all of them are mine,” and she shut her eyes because in that sentence there were people, and in that sentence there was an attempt at the strange modesty of a craftsman who will not take credit for a thing he did not do. He went on, careful because the cuffs made care a language. “I do not put them in the river. I do not make graves because the ground here is bad. There is a place the market forgot when the flood taught it to be afraid of its own ankles. You have the journal? You will have it. It lists what you want, not because I wanted you to know, but because I want to remember how to make something and not be ashamed later of how poor the work was. There are three. Two women and a boy who wanted to teach himself to walk on the wrong wall. They are not pie. They are not gone the way you think.” He paused, and for a second he looked almost hurt by his own sentence. “You will not believe me when I tell you that I respected them. I did not ask them to like me. I asked them to keep me. They did not. They were not mine. It is hard to talk to a city that talks to everyone else louder.”

Keating came back at the end of that and heard enough to put his hand on his head under his cap like a man shading his eyes at a stupid horizon. He looked at Rollinson and rolled his eyebrows into the question: now? She nodded because now is always when. They read the words they must read and did not make them poetic because the law isn’t. The small man let the words climb onto him and sit. He asked her to let him keep his coat until the car because he did not like what happens to a person when you strip them quickly, and she surprised herself by saying yes, then surprised herself again by not regretting the yes. There was no triumph. It was as if the city had given them both a job and they were clocking out. When they turned to go, he watched the boy being folded into professional kindness and the smallest expression came to his face, something like a flinch at a bright light you didn’t earn.

In CID the room changed to hold him in the way rooms do when they know something new has come to live in them for a bit. They put him in Interview Two because Interview One’s heater makes a noise that could be mistaken for a promise. He sat where the chair makes men feel like boys and folded his hands and looked at the fake wood of the table as if it could be flour. He didn’t ask for a solicitor and then asked for a name that didn’t exist, and when the duty turned up with a face like a crossword clue the room took pity on everyone and let the man sit anyway. Miu slid the thread and the jar photographs into a folder that had his name written in the neat police capitals that make everyone equal for a minute. Keating arranged his face to look both kind and inevitable. Rollinson kept her hand on the jar as if it mattered that he see it sitting there, sealed.

They began as the book says you must begin. He took to the questions like someone who has read what a good witness looks like and has elected to do what that person would do badly out of principle. He spoke of flour as if it were a person you could rely on. He spoke of ovens in the tunnels like he was describing a friend’s kitchen. He denied and he admitted in the same breath and you had to use the transcript to keep them separate. He claimed he had only ever left food in places he thought the hungry would find it because that is a ridiculous kind of kindness that still makes the math wrong. He said names when prompted and none when he was asked to say something unprompted. He did not cry. He did not rage. He did, once, lift his shoulders an inch when she said the words “that meat” and asked him to name it, and when he put the shoulders back down he was a little older by the room’s light.

They did not get to the end of him before three in the morning because people like this have no end that fits into a clock. He gave them a place to dig that was not the river and not the arches and not the mill, but rather the room under the room in the old brewery where the wall has been bricked over in a hurry by men who hate the cold. He told them the pattern of the bricks that would undo quickly, and Miu, who has a heart that works in grids and miracles, went to tell someone to go now with men who can lift walls. He told them limits as if he knew where they were and might be merciful, and Rollinson did not mistake that for generosity.

Carmen Drummond came in at dawn with a face that had not slept and did not intend to. She did the thing you do when the narrative has broken and your body still expects a story; she brought Tupperware. She set it on the table in the room for families, as if anyone there will ever be a family again in the way that word thinks it is, and said she had made something without asking herself if it mattered. She said, “Is he—” and they said, “He is,” and she made a laugh that had air in it like a puncture and then steadied. She asked to see him and they told her she could in the hospital room with the machine that sings about oxygen, and she thanked them by accident because sometimes gratitude is the only tool your hand has learned.

When Saoirse came she wore the wrong jacket for weather and had nails half orange because she had been stopped halfway through being a person by fear. She sat on the plastic chair and talked to Miu about nothing for a minute because she had to wake all the way up to what the world had done, and then she took her phone out and showed Miu the pigeon with one foot and said, as if she had needed to save it up for someone who would not make that face, “He loved that stupid bird.” Miu told her about a fox that had come to her market like a monarch and tried to steal thread, and they both laughed and were stern with themselves for laughing, and the sound lifted the room one inch off its floor.

At the brewery, men who take walls down for a living came and looked at the bad brick and made the faces of people who know what other men’s hands can do when told to be quick. They opened what had been closed by threadbare policy and found what the small man had said they would find. Not all of it was a miracle. A lot of it was worse than the fear and better than the worst, because both of those statements can sit beside each other and not result in a fight. They brought out, carefully, the three he had admitted, and something with metal on it that had once been a ring and had not been swapped, and a small stack of papers that had the childish letters of his recipes and the shape of a life where you fail and try again because failing clean is the only cleanliness you can afford. They closed the hole with a plastic that makes weather apologetic and put a guard there because you must care about the roof and about ghosts at the same time.

By mid-morning, the press had smelled a story and attached adjectives to everything. A man in a scarf went on the radio and used the word liminal twice without being paid for it. A journalist in heels that made their own weather said the word goblin into a camera and then bit her lip because the word tasted like mockery in her mouth and she had not meant to feed it. The city did what cities do; it kept opening. People bought bread and ate it without thinking about what bread had come to mean for three days and would return to meaning once the story found its next name. A woman watered geraniums and did not look down. A boy on a BMX did his best not to make his mother have to know what he was doing.

In Interview Two, Dominik finished a sentence and began another, and sometimes you could hear the river in it and sometimes you could hear empty cupboards, and neither of those made it easier to hate him or easier to forgive him. He asked, once, if he could take his coat off and they let him, and it was a stupid mercy but it was a mercy anyway. He folded it carefully and set it on the floor like a pet that had never bitten anybody. Rollinson asked him what Florida meant to him, and he looked genuinely surprised that she had remembered sunlight. He said it tasted like other people’s holidays. He said planes are honest because they admit they will leave you. He said the city under the city is the only place where your footsteps sound like you.

She did not tell him that footsteps never tell you what you need to know. She did not tell him what she had run from or toward on a track in heat that made your eyelashes sweat. She asked him what “after” meant when he said it on the tarmac, and he thought, properly, as if she had handed him something and he needed to weigh it in two hands. He said it meant being allowed to finish one thing before the next thing came and asked to be fed. He said it meant not being interrupted by men who had never been hungry. He said it meant being more than something you have to be polite to and then forget. He said it meant he could put his head down without counting steps. He said it as if the word had been promised to him and stolen, and she did not give him back anything because there is a limit to charity that protects more lives than it cheats.

When she came out of the room, the jar was still warm from her hand and the flour inside had shifted and smoothed itself, as if movement had taught it to rest. Keating was by the window watching the city without telling it he was watching. He had drawn a circle on his notepad around the word “Lesley,” which meant he was collecting the brave and the ordinary into a small theology of his own. He said, “You’ve done it,” and she shook her head because doing it is not an ending, and he laughed without humour and said, “Yes, I know. You won’t run today, will you,” and she said, “I don’t know,” and found that she meant it.

At the hospital, Eli slept because the body knows when it can. Carmen stroked his hair in a way she had learned from the child he’d been, and Saoirse took a photograph of their hands and did not send it to anyone, because some photos are not for the internet, they are for the life you will have to tell yourself you had. The nurse adjusted a beeping and told a joke that she had told six times this week and had six different laughs for. The doctor wrote words that said dehydration and hypothermia and at this stage no evidence of, and everyone pretended the last four words were a song.

Night came, as it does, ridiculous and predictable and, somehow, always a surprise. The arches breathed. The marina counted the chains between itself and bad weather. The mill slept standing up. St. Leonard’s had its lights on and a woman with a helmet of hair lit a candle without ceremony and said a name she would not have learned in another life. In Interview Two, Dominik asked for water and took it politely and drank it in small sips because he had learned, underground, the size of a swallow, and he closed his eyes briefly after and might have thought of ovens, and might have thought of tracks, and might have thought of a door that had not chosen him. He opened them again when the corridor outside gave him the sound of someone running, and he smiled that almost-smile that never reaches the place smiles live, because he recognised the footfalls as a language; he did not know if the sentence meant he was safe or if it meant that he had finally been stopped in a way that sticks.Chapter 9

Morning wore the face of a man who had lied about sleep and gone into work anyway. The river put on its office voice and the arches shed their secrets with the irritability of something asked to be mundane too early. Rollinson stood at her kitchen counter and ate half a banana because the body has rules she respects when she can, and then she laced a shoe and stood with one untied because running would feel like cheating on a promise. Keating texted a wordless photograph of the sky over the precinct—low, the colour of paper you’ve spilt tea on—and she replied with a dot because punctuation was all she had. On the fridge Eli’s printed face had started to pick up the room’s moisture and his hair blurred very slightly at the edges, as if he were already walking away from the page. She put a hand on him like a blessing and went to catch what could still be caught.

Interview Two had taken on the smell of its occupant, which was flour and something a cleaner would call foreign because it didn’t come out of a bottle. Dominik sat with the posture of a man who has been given a job in a windowless place and intends to do it right. The duty solicitor had found his rhythm and stopped trying to catch the ends of sentences that weren’t for him. Miu came in with a labelled envelope as if she were delivering a verdict; inside was a photocopy from the journal the search team had taken out of the brewery wall. The handwriting had the patience of someone who has learned to be kind to paper—round, cautious, with little licks at the bottoms of letters like tongues apologising for consonants. She slid three pages across and watched him not look at them.

“Tell me what this one means,” Rollinson said, tapping a diagram that looked like a pie crust and a street map if they’d been left in a room together overnight. “These three thumbprints. We found them under a rack. You left them where we would look.”

He glanced down as if she had asked him to check if a child was asleep and then back up with the tiniest offence at having been believed so quickly. “Three is not magic for me,” he said. “Three is practical. One for the city. One for the fire. One for the person who will eat. If you do not give each their place, you get a mess. Mess is disrespectful. Mess gets you caught.” He lifted his cuffed hands a centimetre, making the message neat. “And you caught me anyway.”

“We caught you because you wanted a door to mean something,” she said, letting admiration in like a draught and then shutting it away. “You call this a recipe. It reads like you talking to yourself in a language you’ve taught the paper. Where did you learn to bake in tunnels.”

“In a place where the ovens go into the ground,” he said, and the words came out so simple she almost tripped on them. “It is sensible. Heat goes up. The bread rises and the roof rises with it. You can make a church out of steam if you have enough water and no shame. The men made us do it because it made them feel clever and then the women did it without the men because the bread would not bake if you told it who was allowed to touch it. You do not have that in this place. Your ovens sit like cars. Your heat is angry.”

She let the picture he had drawn have its time and then filed it next to others to be dealt with when she could be alone with it. “Three,” she said, to make him think she was somewhere else. “You said three at the brewery, and again here. Two women and a boy. Names.”

He gave them in a sequence that was not chronological but had its own order. The names fell into the room and looked around to see where they might sit. One of the women had been a stallholder who fell out with her sister and decided an empty evening was safe because safety had never shown her its face; the other had slept near the orchestra pit at the theatre because she liked the way drums learn the hearts of buildings; the boy had been trying to change the angle of himself in the mirror with pills and with bravado, and neither had worked. He had not made them pie, he said again, like this was a kindness you could claim in court. He had not put a person into pastry and fed them to the city like a trick. “That is a cartoon,” he said quietly, and his mouth had an old hurt in it. “That is you making me into a thing you can fold and put in the paper. I am not folded.”

Miu’s throat made a sound and stopped itself because sound cannot always be allowed to finish. She had been at the brewery before dawn and had come back with brick dust on her collar and the look the river gives you when you ask too much of it. “We’ve begun the dig,” she said, not to him, to the room. “He told us where the wall tastes of salt. He was right. He was fussy about where things sit. The pattern was careful. He did not stack people. He made shelves out of crates and shame.” She grimaced at her own choice of word and went on, gentler. “We’ll give them names again. We’ll give them places that aren’t this cold.”

Keating had been out back pretending to like a policeman’s coffee with the uniformed lad who’d lifted Eli into the ambulance, and he came in as Miu finished, bringing with him the smell of the car park and a slice of the morning that had remembered it was winter. He took a chair because chairs are a way to let anger sit without making a scene. He said to Dominik, “You told us not all were yours. Who else leaves flour,” and Dominik’s face changed, not with fear but with a kind of disappointed amusement.

“You want the comfort of a copy,” he said. “Another I you can put in a second room and keep me neat. It is not always flour. Sometimes it is plaster. Sometimes it is salt. Sometimes it is a woman who uses sugar the way I use patience because she thinks sweetness will make people keep still.” He tilted his head. “You did not look at the woman with the small dog who sits by the green bridge and knots things. You thought she was making a scarf for someone who will never put it on. She ties the city in threads. She tells herself she blesses. You are not the only ones with your hands out.”

They all went quiet then because the air had changed shape and they needed to see what room it was pretending to be. Keating wrote “woman with small dog, green bridge” on his pad because not writing it would make it a thought and thoughts dissolve unless you put them somewhere that complains about ink. Miu raised her eyebrows to the shape that meant “another day of this, then” and “fine,” and “let’s make it so practical even the river will see it coming.” Rollinson didn’t move for a count of eight. She was good at eights. She had learned at sixteen that eight is the number you give a body if you want it to untangle itself before a race. Then she stood and took the jar with her not because it was evidence—Miu had bagged its twin—but because it had weight that did not argue.

Carmen and Saoirse were at the hospital on a schedule that had announced itself without anyone writing it down. Morning meant changing the water in the cup so the boy’s mouth knew he mattered, and making jokes you could regret later in peace. Afternoon meant two women taking turns being strong until the turn wore thin and you could see the woman underneath. Evening meant not counting the visits because counting is a superstition and you don’t want the gods of arithmetic to think they can bargain with you. Eli slept, periodically and then again, and when he woke he startled like a bird hit with kindness. The nurse with the joke repertoire wrote thirst improving in a box and underlined it softly. The consultant called dehydration “reversible,” as if the word had ever stopped anyone doing it.

The press officer had put on a jacket that meant he could say “ongoing investigation” without being hit. He did that outside the station and added “lines of inquiry,” “forensic examination,” and “community thanks,” as if these were herbs that would make a stew you could eat. Behind him the city did a thing it had not done for a while; it stopped briefly to listen and then pretended it had not stopped. A journalist in a coat the colour of apology set her mouth around the word “goblin” and chose not to say it aloud, not because she was kind, but because she was tired of giving the same myth a free meal. Dr. Broughton went on the radio and said “threshold” and “feast” and the presenter said “interesting,” which is the word people use when they want to put a plate down and leave the room.

The woman at the green bridge with the small dog had a face like a bag of lemons and a mouth that had learned the shapes of thank you and stop it from two different grandmothers. She sat with a knotted bag of yarn at her elbow and a lap like a workshop. The city had decided she was part of the view and therefore owned her, and she had decided to own it back by knowing the names of the ducks. When Rollinson approached with the walk that gets you asked directions in foreign cities, the woman looked up, measured the shoe to the day to the girl-if-she-were-one, and said in a voice you could sand a banister with, “No offence, but you people only come down here when the river puts a body on for company.”

“We came for your thread,” Rollinson said, and the woman’s mouth did the thing mouths do when they find out someone has been paying attention in a way they can’t immediately hate. The dog, who had the air of having been rescued from a richer person, sniffed Rollinson’s calves and weighed her worth like meat on a scale. The yarn was blue with a sincerity that cotton rarely manages, and there were ties in a neat chain along the railings where the bridge had learned to rust gracefully. The knots were small and mean and true.

“I tie blessings,” the woman said, forestalling accusation by offering ridicule. “It’s an old thing. My mother did it and her mother did it and the one before her would have tied the wind if she could get hold of it. People come to me and say ‘my son’ or ‘my sister’ or ‘my heart’ and I tie a thing that is the length of the person’s name said at a normal rate without showing off. I cut it with my teeth because the scissors went in a charity shop bag twenty years ago and I didn’t have the argument in me to get them back. If you want to make it a crime, do. It’ll get the council down here with a sign.” She flexed her fingers, showing knuckles the size of peaches. “He took thread,” she added, with the casualness of someone selling a memory for pennies. “Your small man. He asked how I did the knot and then he did it wrong. He tied it like you tie up a fish. I told him not to insult the river with ligatures and he laughed the way men laugh when they’re trying not to show their teeth. He had blue in his pockets and a manner like a boy practising priest. I told him not to use my knots to keep things in. I told him a knot is for letting go. He came back and did it my way and I do not know whether to be proud or to move house.”

“You saw him last when,” Keating asked, because dates in a line are how you turn a legend into calendar entries, and that is half the job.

“Two days after the flood anniversary,” she said, and had the decency to look embarrassed at being the sort of person who keeps anniversaries for water. “He came with a jar. He looked at the jar, not at me. He asked if I ever tied for people who weren’t lost yet, and I told him that’s the only tying worth doing. He had a ring he kept moving from pocket to pocket like it was burning him. He told me his name was something from a sticker and I told him that wasn’t a name, that was a theft that happened to fit. He liked me for five minutes. Then he stopped.”

They walked the railings and counted the knots in their heads, because superstition has never stopped anyone doing their job better and might have helped. Miu took one down with the reverence that says this is both evidence and a prayer. The blue was the same as the haberdasher’s cards and the jars and the thread burned at one end that had made a cameo in a pie; it had dye that hadn’t been told to stop. She tied it to the corner of a plastic bag and, without meaning to, made her version of the woman’s knot, which was ugly and faithful.

Dominik, back at the table, spoke of cities as if they were soups. He named the places where the stock takes its colour. He itemised the people who are always there when you turn a corner and the ones the city invents to make a point. He did not confess and he did not deny; he curated. He gave them enough to fill pages and kept back the thin thread that tied the pages together, because power lies in the difference between a book and a pile of paper. When he tired he put his forehead to the backs of his hands and listened to his own blood as if it were a story with jokes. When he lifted his head, he said to Rollinson, “You do not run anymore,” and she pretended she had not heard him name a thing she had not told.

In the afternoon the dig team at the old brewery called with their voices pitched to carry guilt and excitement at the same time. They had found not a body but a box under the bricked-up stair, tin, with a lid that said biscuits in a font that had been designed to look like you ought to trust it. Inside were papers that had outlasted a flood and the particular humidity of regret. The journal’s older sibling was there, grease-ringed and faithful, with recipes that were closer to maps and maps that were closer to diaries. There were letters in a hand that had learned to make Latin letters reluctantly, signed with a name that was not Dominik, that had too many consonants at the front like a traffic jam. There was a photograph of him as a boy standing by a low doorway with women in headscarves laughing at something their bodies had decided to like even if their faces hadn’t caught up. There was a church programme in a language that sang even when it was about soup. There was a train ticket to a city with a different alphabet. Miu stood over the box like a midwife, and when she lifted one paper to bag it, a blue thread caught and clung because threads will.

Keating had been tasked with the sin of bureaucracy: he called CPS. He did it with a voice that said he understood the cost of words, and when the woman on the other end said “charging decision” and “public interest” and asked for the star witness to have a face, he said, “I can give you jars and thread and a boy who says there was meat that wasn’t the meat his mother buys and pies with patterns from jars that stopped being made before he was born,” and then, because he is not a man to make his work poetic for strangers, he said, “You’ll have him in front of a bench. He will talk until he wears the wood smooth. Our job is to make it so he talks about what he did to people and not what the city did to him.”

At sunset, which presented itself like a good imitation of peace, a call came in from St. Leonard’s. The woman with the hair who lit candles because no one else would had found, at the base of the saint with the chains, another pie. It had been placed on a folded towel. It had been stamped with a pattern that was jar-like and not the same jar. It had been tied with thread that was not blue but a respectable ecclesiastical red. The note beneath was in careful hand and said with sympathy and malice: After. The choir master swore from the diaphragm and the vicar went pale in the way of men who have spent a lot of time telling you stories about evil without expecting to meet any, and the verger covered the pie with a silver cloche because that is what you put over things that are too real in churches.

Rollinson stood under the porch that bats pretend is theirs and read the word once and then again and then let it stop being a word and become a trick. She felt for the jar under her arm and found it there, ridiculous and true. Dominik was in a room with a man who could make toast the wrong way. He had not, could not have, left a pie at a church whose joke he understood. She looked up at St. Leonard, who had never baked anything in his life, and she wanted him to shrug. He did not. Keating came up from the side gate making a sound like a man holding his breath too long and handed her his phone with a photograph from a woman at the common who had seen a small figure in a coat pass very quickly from shadow to shadow an hour ago. The figure was small and the coat was long and the photograph had meant to be proof. The thread on the pie was red and the jar’s ridges were wider and the crimp was wrong.

Miu, when she saw it, did a thing like a nod and like a bow. “Copycat or apprentice or enemy,” she said. “We made a public. We asked for it. Or we had one and it’s telling us it was here all along. This is not his hand. He will be offended. He will be relieved. He will be dangerous because offended and relieved together make a human who wants to make a point.”

In the interview room, when they told him someone had left a pie in his absence, his face did not move and then did a tiny thing like a bird readjusting its weight. He said very quietly, without offering them the drama they would have devoured, “No,” and then put his hands on the table and left flour there like he was blessing it. “They do it badly,” he said. “They will burn the bottom. They will forget the steam. They will make the crust do a job it is not supposed to do. They will not understand that you cannot take what you have not given.” He looked, for the first time all day, less certain of his way of talking than a person needs to be to make it convincing. “You must not ask me to teach them. I will not teach them. I will not save them from their own bad hands.”

“You’ll teach us,” she said, seizing the small mercy and turning it, because you learn to do that or you go home broken. “You’ll tell us what is wrong with it and why. You will tell us where they bought red thread and which jars in the city have that pattern. You will tell us the way a wrong thing moves. If there is a second door, we will find it without you. If there is a second hand, we will take it at the wrist.”

He looked at the jar under her arm like it had been joined to the conversation without being asked, and his mouth did something that might have been a plea if he had believed in those. “After,” he said, and she said, “Now,” and between them the word made a tone she could hold onto.

She went home in the hour where sirens stop meaning a single thing and start being the city’s bad lullaby. She put the jar on her kitchen table and sat opposite it like it were a person she had to have out with. She thought of Florida, and of tracks, and of the first time she had run until the world became a ribbon she could hold at both ends. She thought of the boy she had taken out of a cupboard with a river in it and of the boys she had not, and she did not let herself make an altar out of that arithmetic. She phoned her father and let it ring until the gap between two of his breaths and hers was small enough to step across, and when he said her name like a hand she said, “It’s not over,” and he said, “It never is,” which was a kindness if you tilt it, and then he told her about his tomatoes, and she let him.

At dawn, the fox that enjoys theatricality trotted along the railings by the green bridge with its tail writing rude words in the air. The woman with the lemons face tied a red thread with spite and cut it with her teeth and dared the day to make something of it. Lesley at the mill put a biscuit aside against the possibility of a man who would never come to take it, because hope is not rational and does not need to be. Ruiz swept her sill without touching the flour she could see because she wanted to see what it would do if treated as a living thing. The harbourmaster yawned and counted keys and guessed wrong because numbers cannot save you from yourself. In CID, Miu took the red thread and the jar and the photograph and put them together under a light like a little altar to patience. Keating drew a second circle on the map and called it “who,” not because he thought the map would answer but because he wanted to see the word on paper. Rollinson put her trainers on and then put them properly on and went to the river and ran, finally, not to chase and not to be chased but because she had to put a line through the morning so that the day would know what speed to be. When she came back her lungs had learned another word for after, and it was work.Chapter 10

The city woke wearing its cheap Sunday dignity and the rain tried to pretend it was a sacrament again, pattering on windows like a priest who doesn’t know how to knock. At CID, the board had grown edges where red thread now lived in a labelled sleeve. Miu had placed it under the light and spoken to it as if it might answer, the way you speak to a pet you haven’t admitted is yours. The pie from St. Leonard’s had cooled on the evidence table and refused to tell them who had touched it, as if pastry could have a code of silence. Keating drank the sort of coffee that makes the windscreen in your head fog up and said out loud what they were all pretending not to taste: this one’s wrong.

Wrong traveled through the room with its shoes off. It was in the crimp, too even; it was in the bottom, a shade too dark, a pride burnt into it. It was in the smell—sugar on the front of the tongue and a muddle behind, where Dominik had always been a man of clean lines. It was in the thread, of course, not cotton or not exactly, with a shine like Sunday clothes. Miu turned the fiber under the scope and said rayon, softly, the way you say a person’s middle name when you want to let them know you know it. Rayon, dyed red into the bone. Rayon like choir sashes and kneelers stitched by hands that could tie knots in their sleep. Rayon that doesn’t live at the covered market at all, because the woman with the sandpaper voice sells cotton, polyester if she’s in a mood, never rayon, never red with ecclesiastical sincerity.

Rollinson stood with her palms pressed to the counter until her skin told her she still had one job and it was this job and not all the others you invent when your heart runs too fast. “Liturgical supply,” she said, and Miu nodded without looking up, because sometimes the easy line is true, and the trick is to take it without feeling cheap. “Or embroidery guild,” Keating added, because he had once dated a woman who could talk about thread for an hour without repeating herself, and he remembered the taste of those Sundays in the back of his teeth. “Kneelers,” Miu said. “Banners. Cassocks that get mended unseen. Women with keys to cupboards even the vicar’s forgotten. Men who like the look of order and will tell you it is worship.”

St. Leonard’s obliged them with a cupboard that had not been opened to police since the Blitz. The woman with the helmet hair produced the key with the solemnity of a magician choosing to spoil the trick. The cupboard had a smell like both death and lavender. The shelves were lined with plastic tubs labeled in a hand that had opinions: GREEN – ORDINARY TIME; GOLD – NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH; RED – MARTYRS & THE HOLY SPIRIT, DO NOT MIX. The red tub had a notch in its plastic mouth like a bite. The spool at the top was lighter than a spool should be. The list on the inside door of the cupboard had been kept with a fidelity you wanted to kiss. Last logged taken: 25 metres of red rayon for Pentecost banner repairs (B. Loughton). Returned: 6 metres, “partial.” No date. No signature. The vicar peered with the baffled guilt of a man who is suddenly the custodian of a crime and said, “Beatrice is the sort of person the church runs on. She notices candles before they notice themselves.”

They found her Thursday-woman in Monday clothes, in a room so clean it had opinions. Beatrice Loughton had the face people call “kind” because it is small and stubborn and makes you feel bad when you are lazy. Her fingers were that peculiar brand of strong that comes from tying knots until your life is knotted around you in neat bows, and her dog took one look at Keating and decided he was the sort you could talk into biscuits. The kneeler in her lap was half a lamb and half a smudge. She looked up when they came in and put the needle into the wool with the neat violence of a woman refusing to drop a stitch in public.

“No offence,” she said, which was a lie, “but the last time you came here it was because someone had drunk the Communion wine and fallen asleep in the vestry, and I don’t have time to repeat myself to the police and God in the same week.”

“We’re here because the red thread you signed out has become part of our story,” Rollinson said, and watched the woman decide whether “our” was an insult. “We need to know where it went and why. We need to know if anyone else took it with your blessing, or without.”

Beatrice’s face did what faces do when they discover they have been included in a narrative they would not have chosen. She put the kneeler aside and brushed her skirt like lint could be persuaded to become time. “We had moth,” she said. “We had the kind of moths that make a joke out of heritage and the women who care for it. I signed out more than I needed because the shop that sells it only opens when the owner isn’t tired. I used what I needed. I kept the rest in the drawer marked DRAW STRINGS & CONSCIENCE. If you are asking me if I mended a pie with the Lord’s thread, you can take yourselves straight back to your station and write that down and see how it looks.

“I do, however, know a woman who is very fond of telling people what belongs to God and what doesn’t,” she added, with the casual malice that keeps committees alive, “and who would have considered it her duty to dramatise this moment even if she had to learn to cook to do it. The verger has a key to the cupboard, of course. She has a key to everything. The choir master has keys, because authority is a way to make keys fall into your hand like rain. And there’s Mrs. Talford with the flower rota, who sells jam out of her boot and has jars that make other people’s jars jealous.”

Miu made a short, might-be-a-cough sound at the word “jars,” and Beatrice’s dog put its head on her shoe because kindness is contagious when properly applied. “Mrs. Talford,” Keating said, writing it in a hand that could be read when it mattered, “what does she sell.”

“Pride,” Beatrice said. “Strawberry if it’s June. Apricot if her sister-in-law’s apricot tree remembers to feed the family which planted it. Quince if she wants to show off. She came into church on Friday with a bundle of towels because she is a woman who cannot bear an object without a purpose, and she set them on the shelf in the porch because wet elbows will happen. If you are the sort of person who uses a towel for a stage, you might have chosen one of hers. She wouldn’t give you the credit. She would say she was helping God. She has red thread in her house, of course, but it is the wrong sort, the sort from a supermarket that tells you you’re being thrifty while robbing you blind.”

Mrs. Talford received them with the suspicion of the justly busy, in a kitchen that had learned how to forgive a boil-over. Her jars sat on the windowsill like little stained-glass windows, and she stood between them and the world with her arms folded like a guard dog that knows people mistake it for a grandmother. She had towels folded in a heap so precise you could have cut your finger on the corners. When they asked where she had been Sunday evening she gave them the times of everyone else’s movements as if to remind them she lived in a neighbourhood, not a crime scene.

“I put the towels in the porch because people come in wet and they leave wet,” she said, and her voice had the rasp of a woman who steam-cleans her own conscience. “I did not consent to my towels being used for theatre. I have red thread because I mend pillowcases because other people forget pillowcases are mended things. My thread is cheap and reliable, like me. I do not fancy copying a goblin for the sake of a headline. You are looking for a person who wants to keep the story alive because their face lives in it now. Look for someone who likes the sound of ‘after’ and says it to themselves in bed. Look for a man in a coat you would never trust in your wardrobe. Look for the choir master if you want a man who thinks God puts on a show. Don’t look at me. I have a sister in Leeds with a hip and I pay for taxis with jars.”

The choir master lifted his chin and his consonants to meet them. He had the kind of charm that had never been told it must be careful, and a body that looked most natural on a podium with people making noise exactly the way he decided. He kept his scores in stacks like fragile buildings and talked at them with a neat contrition that suggested he imagined their faces under a balcony. “If you’re going to ask whether I skulked through the porch tying notes to pies,” he said, and enjoyed how vulgar that sounded, “you could at least sit down so I can do this without a crick in my neck. I was with the tenors at seven and with the sopranos at eight and at nine I was drinking tea with a woman who has taught two generations of this city to sing without embarrassment. She is old enough to make holding hands with her look like piety. Ask her if I left the room. She will tell you in a voice that could lead an orchestra section to war that I did not. I don’t bake. I rehearse. The two are similar only in that both require a fear of being wrong.”

Back at CID, the pie’s rayon thread under the microscope was as unforgiving as any altar guild captain, and the jar-rim pattern was traced on tracing paper so Miu could lay it over jars in shops and on pictures as if that were a game that would spare anyone. The ridge matched a brand that had started turning up in delis with chalkboards and opinions: a new design with wide grooves, jars made elsewhere and sold here with labels that tell you a story about provenance and milk the past for marketing. The covered market didn’t stock them; Mrs. Talford wouldn’t swallow the price; the church did not have them because churches have twelve kinds of kettle and no money for fashionable glass. The deli two streets from the church did, in stacks above the cold meats with their little flags. The assistant said a woman bought three jars with nothing in them because she said she liked the shape. The assistant remembered her because she paid in coins and called him “dear heart” like a woman who has done children and wants it acknowledged.

Dominik sat in Interview Two with his eyes open like shutters in sun and let the day crawl past him. When they told him about rayon, he snorted very gently like a man who had been taught to mock a particular class of thread. When they told him about jars with fashionable ridges he shook his head with a neat, disappointed economy. He said “no” again, the kind of “no” that refuses to perform for tape, and then lifted his cuffed hands a fraction as if to ask for air. “If you must leave food at a church,” he said, his voice small and unembarrassed, “you do not tie it in the colour of blood unless you do not understand hunger. Red is for men who like to think the knife is always the point. This is a man who would sing loudly to cover the fact he does not know the words. Or a woman who has been told to be neat all her life and would like an untidy sin.”

“Then help us name the sin,” Rollinson said, keeping the temper out of her voice because real cooperation is skittish. “He uses rayon. He buys jars. He uses the parish porch. He knows your sentence and bids against it. He knows you are here and thinks that means the story moved and left him a space where he can stand.”

Dominik examined the fake wood for a full slow breath and then allowed himself to look at Miu the way you look at someone whose kindness is not dependent on your performance. “He will over-season,” he said. “He will use thyme when there is no need for thyme. He will not balance salt because salt is the thing you learn last and it is the first thing you think you know. He will leave flour where he thinks flour should be left and will not see where flour goes when you are not looking. He will try to tie the day shut and the knot will slip because rayon is a poor thread for knots.” He frowned, and in the frown there was a spite he could not completely tame. “He stole your word, after. He does not understand what it cost to say.”

They put eyes on the deli because that is what you do when you can’t think of the clever thing and you need the useful thing. They stood in church porches with the permission of women who have given the church more hours than their husbands and preferred it. They drank tea that had seen better kettles. They watched Mrs. Talford sell jam to three people who wanted to talk about grandchildren and to one who wanted a fight about sugar. They watched the choir master give instructions to a boy with a voice like glass and forgive him for being seventeen. They watched Beatrice tie her knot at the top of a banner and make a child hold her breath for it. They looked for red thread in coat pockets and in the cuffs of people who like cuffs.

Saoirse came to CID because the hospital had tired of her vigilant kindness and asked her to use it somewhere that wouldn’t make the monitors nervous. She perched on the edge of a chair like a person practicing being smaller than her worry and told Rollinson the things that mattered to a person who would have to wake up tomorrow and choose a face. Eli had called her “idiot” with love before they shooed her home. He had asked about the pigeon and laughed with his throat like he had found the shelf he’d been reaching for. He had said “after” when the nurse told him the drip would be out and he could have toast, and Saoirse had flinched at the word and then reclaimed it because she had no interest in ceding language to men who made pies at people. She asked if she ought to take down the pictures from her Instagram because sometimes strangers were saying things under them and she didn’t know what to do with the words. Rollinson asked her to leave them up and send her the worst of the comments because sometimes evidence wears lipstick and you have to be equal-opportunity about taking it.

Miu made a list of thread sellers within walking distance of St. Leonard’s and then within walking distance of the deli and then within walking distance of any place a person might mistake for a door. There was a shop that sold embroidery silks to women who restore kneelers and to men who fancy themselves the kind of eccentric whose opinions are worth paying for. There was a cupboard in a sacristy with a sign-up sheet that had not been signed in six months because the last person to care had died and no one had yet dared to write their name over hers. There was an online shop that would get it to you tomorrow if you ticked the right box. There was a stall at the Saturday market that sold lengths of ribbon for little girls and men who wanted to put bows on things that had not asked to be gifts. It had rayon. It had red. It had a woman with fingers stained the colour of cherries and a smile like a wilting corsage.

They watched the ribbon stall for a morning and were rewarded not by their man but by a parade of other people’s earnestness. A mother bought three metres for a school project and carried the guilt of not wanting to do it. A teenager bought ten centimetres and tied it to his shoe and immediately forgot why that had been a good idea. A man in a coat too expensive for his temper bought nothing but asked how much, loudly, for five minutes. The woman at the stall cut red and cut blue and cut green, and every time she closed her scissors there was a sound like an argument that ended too quickly. They saw no rayon leave for a person who walked like a sin.

The lab rang, and for once the call was not a slap. The meat in the church pie belonged to two animals, both of which could be named on paper in a room where people don’t flinch easily: pork and pigeon, the latter in quantities that made the technician laugh without joy. There was no human protein, no exotic fret, no mystery. There was spice that thought well of itself. There was a burnt sugar top that would have looked good in a window if you didn’t smell it. Dominik, when told, said only, very softly, “They put a city bird in a church and thought it was clever,” and didn’t look at anyone for a quarter of a minute.

A CCTV camera in the deli gave them what CCTV always gives: confirmation of what you knew and none of what you hoped for. A woman with a scarf pin that made a little red wound on her throat had bought the jars on Friday afternoon and told the boy on the till that plastic was killing seals. Her scarf was church-conservative and weather-agnostic. Her hair had decided not to indulge fashion in this decade or any other. She paid with coins that made Miu immediately suspicious because the amount had too many tens. She left with a bag that said “heritage” and walked home in a straight line because she had never liked curves.

They found her two streets from the church in a maisonette that had tried to imagine itself into a house. Her name was Honor Talford, Mrs. Talford’s sister-in-law with the hip, convalescing with a severity that made the furniture ashamed. She had jars on her counter, empty and thrilling. She had red thread not in her drawer but on her table, because she has never learned the sort of shame that would make you put things away purely for guests. She had a towel, one of the church towels, washed and folded above reproach. She had a pie dish with the kind of ring of flour only people who are tidy leave. When they said “pie” she white-knuckled the table and then let go because this was not a room for liars who enjoyed themselves. When they said “St. Leonard” she put her hand to her mouth and lowered it again because what can a hand do with a church.

“I didn’t hurt anyone,” she said, and watched them watching her for the tell. “I do not have the stomach for hurting. I put a pie under a statue because the city had decided a story lived in pies and it did not want to stop talking and I thought if I put down a full stop the sentence would end. I tied it properly because I don’t like messy offerings. I used red because the day was a martyr’s day. I used pigeon because I thought it was a joke the city would get. I thought perhaps he,” and she flinched at having to call Dominik a pronoun, “would see that he was not the only one who could make signs, and he would stop. I thought the police would say, ‘Look, it is someone else now,’ and everyone would go to bed.”

“How did you know about the sentence,” Keating asked, and the hope had curdled in his voice into a kind of resignation, because this is what radio does in a city: it puts ideas under your pillow and calls it sleep. “How did you know ‘after’.”

“I listened to the nice man with the scarves,” she said, and they all closed their eyes very briefly, even Miu. “He said ‘feast’ and ‘sacrifice’ and I thought, yes, yes, that is how the city tells itself it’s doing things for reasons. I thought, if he has a language, then I must too. I bought the jars because Mrs. Talford said mine were ugly and I am so very tired of being told I am wrong and I am so very tired of nothing ever ending properly. I don’t want this to be my fault. I would like to pay and go home.”

They did not cuff her because the law is not a hammer for every nail, and because the pie had not bled anyone and because intention is a ghost you cannot bag. They lectured her, and it felt like theatre to everyone in the room and still had to be done. They took her thread because evidence is greedy. They told her she had placed herself in a story and that stories make payments in lives, and she looked at the red and did something like a bow. When they left, Rollinson wanted to sit down on Honor’s little sofa and tell a grown woman to stop trying to manage endings with props, but there was a city outside that had begun to whisper in a more interesting way.

A boy in a scooter shop had bought blue thread with a card that wasn’t his on Saturday and used the word “blessings” at the till like a tourist. The woman with the lemons face had seen a man tie a knot at the green bridge and tie it wrong, and when she had barked at him from her bench he had grinned at her with an entire childhood’s worth of insubordination and said, “It’s for after,” like a boy promising he’ll put the garden tools back. It wasn’t Dominik—too tall, too pleased with edging into someone else’s good work, too bored by patience. It was a youth, nineteen maybe, with a new tattoo that his mother would regret and he would carry like a coin under his tongue. He wore a coat stolen from a charity bin because charity and theft share a gate. He had a ringing laugh at his own audacity and a bruise that meant someone had taken a swing at him and missed the lesson.

They trawled the scooters and the new tattoos and the boys who used “after” to mean “vibe” and found one working at a burger place by the ring road, flipping meat like punctuation. His name was Kadeem. He had a grin that made adolescent girls fall over their vowels and a mother who worked the morning shift in a laundrette and didn’t have time for the bruises of a city’s pet myth. He denied it like an artist and admitted it like a child. He hadn’t baked the church pie. He’d tied the wrong knot and liked the sound of women telling him off. He’d bought the thread for a girl who wanted to make her trainer laces match. He knew the man at the edges, though—the one who had been watching him try to skate in the underpass and had told him he had “promise,” which is the word men use if they want to stand near your fire without burning their hands. The man had given him a piece of crust he hadn’t wanted to eat and had said, “After,” with the authority of those who think a word is a leash.

When they described the man, Kadeem picked the choir master’s face from a line-up and then put it down with a shake. “Nah,” he said. “He’s not that. He’s… you know when a person stands where adults stand, but they’re not wearing it right. He got gloves, like fancy gloves that don’t do anything. He got shoes that make you step around the puddles and I think about splashing him on purpose. He smells like church, but not like the holy bit. He smells like the bronze that never got polished. He got rings? Like one of those college guys who never left their college.”

There is a particular shame in being told by a boy frying burgers that the person you think you are looking for is someone who used to be better dressed. Keating took it with a professional nod and wrote “gloves, rings, shoes childish about puddles,” and the words looked ridiculous and plausible all at once. Miu ran the CCTV from the Saturday market again with the kind of eye that forgives nothing but does not hate, and there he was in the far corner of a frame: a man tall enough to take up space without asking, a coat that wanted to be a statement and had been bought as one, gloves too clean, a hat that tried to look like cap and missed because fashion makes fools of the nervous. He had a jar-shaped bag that had never seen jam, and he had a way of stepping over flour that said he had never cooked for anyone who could write their own sentence.

They put the picture under Dominik’s gaze because sometimes the one person you should not ask is the only person who will care enough to answer correctly. Dominik’s mouth tightened like a stitch. He said, “He smells of velvet in a wardrobe that no one opens,” which was not helpful in the paperwork sense. He said, “He will come to the church again because he thinks God is an audience you can bully,” which was. He said, “He will not know where the river is deepest. He will make a bad pie and a better scene. He will not have the patience for after, he will use it like a fog,” which made Rollinson’s spine turn her into the kind of instrument you can tune a day with.

They set the porch like a theatre with too many lights and the wrong number of chairs. They let Beatrice be Beatrice because she could not be stopped, and because nothing puts a thief off like the sight of a woman who knows where the tape lives and has already measured your sin. They put a constable in a cassock carefully misbuttoned so that anyone who cared would have to fix it before committing a crime. They left a towel folded the way Mrs. Talford folds it and a jar on the shelf like a provocation and a gift. The verger took against all of it and then took a biscuit when Keating offered one with a face like the law.

He came just before the light decided to warm itself. He came in gloves he thought made him look like an idea and in a hat that had been made for men with less anxiety about their skulls. He put the pie down with both hands like anyone would if they were a good person doing a good thing, and then he made the mistake all amateurs make and looked around as if a choir should have started. He had red thread in his pocket like an alibi. He had the jar with the wrong ridges and the right label. He had a mouth that practiced rules and then ignored them. He had that smell Dominik had named and that Kadeem had hated, the smell of bronze holding onto a decade.

Rollinson stepped into the porch from the dark like a promise that has decided to be a threat. She let him see her, which was more merciful than letting him imagine ghosts. She said, conversationally, “Red is easy to find,” and he flinched like a man whose whole life had been a series of gentle corrections he had learned to resent. He reached for the pie in an automatic gesture of tidying and bumped the towel instead, and Beatrice’s hand shot out from the vestry and straightened it with a violence that made him forget his plan.

“You don’t get to rehearse this,” Keating said, stepping in the way a man does who knows where to put his shoulder. “You don’t get to swap out your scene partner for a better one. You don’t get to say after when the rest of us are still standing in the during. Hands, please.”

They took him without breaking the pie because sometimes you get to practice beauty after all. He did not fight, not properly; he wriggled in the way of boys in assemblies who dislike being called by their whole name. He gave his name with unnecessary Latin in it and no truth and then gave the name his laundry used and that one fit. He said he only ever wanted to “mark the moment,” and Beatrice gave him a look that would have set wolves back on their heels. He said he had bought rayon because the good thread was more expensive and he had left his conscience in his other jacket. He said he had thought about blood all afternoon and wondered if that made him interesting.

“You made a cake of yourself and hoped the church would eat it,” Beatrice said, and her voice made the stone take notice. “Now go and be cleaned in a place that knows how to do it without hymns.”

He had a ring on his finger with a flat face that had once held a letter and now held an indentation where the letter had been scratched off. It made a noise on the tabletop in Interview Three like a spoon. He told them he had seen everything on the news and wanted to be part of it because he had never been part of anything worth talking about. He told them he had listened to the man on the radio and found his words like plums. He told them he had not watched boys. He told them he had taken nothing that would have screamed when he left. He told them he had baked what he imagined would fix a grief. He told them he had tried to be kind to an absence and had failed at it, which is something.

Dominik listened to the story through the thin glass and made his face the wall it had learned to be. The red thread stayed red, rayon refused to become cotton by force of will. Miu put the threads in their folders and made the folders sit straight because that helps more than anyone admits. Keating wrote “no more pies” at the bottom of his pad and then crossed it out because you never get to write a line like that and keep it. Rollinson left the church with the towel folded in her hands and the word after refusing, stubbornly, to belong to anyone but the work.

She went to the hospital because Sunday had left her just enough strength to watch someone sleep without bargaining. Eli’s machine sang the pragmatic song of oxygen and the nurse with the jokes told a new one and Carmen, who had gone past sleep and out the other side into something you do not name, put a hand on Rollinson’s arm with a weight like thanks. Saoirse showed her the picture of the pigeon, again, and said, “He wants to see it on Wednesday,” and that was as close as the day was going to come to hope without burning itself.

On the way back she passed the green bridge and the woman with lemons tied a knot that had nothing to do with police and everything to do with the kind of magic grandmothers practice when they have run out of reasons to explain. The fox that likes to rehearse jumped down and made himself an understudy for the day. The river breathed, not kindly and not unkindly; like a thing alive and busy. The city put its head down and went on. And for an hour, in the room where people’s words are recorded so they can be believed later, one man who had been terribly certain learned to be quiet while another man who had always spoken softly allowed himself to say “after” and mean now.
