The day he found the book, the wind had a dry, salty tang to it, as if the Downs had been licked clean. Toowoomba’s streets wore their jacaranda shadows like shawls, splotches of bruise-purple and threadbare shade. Professor Edwin March, sixty-one in his birth certificate and forty-two in his stubborn bones, held a third-hand translation of an older translation of a fourteenth-century fencing manual and tried to explain to himself why he wanted it.

“Research,” he muttered, standing in the second-hand shop between a shelf of romance paperbacks and a plastic tub of tangled cords. “Embodied cognition, cultural transmission, late medieval pedagogy.”

This argument had scruples enough to get him out of the shop with the book. But even he could hear the slant of it. The way you bend truth to keep it from rolling away down Margaret Street.

His office at the university was a window looking at a gum tree and a sliver of sky the color of old zinc. He placed the book on his desk, above a drift of paper marked in his sharp, crabbed handwriting. The spine cracked. The pages smelled of someone else’s shed. The translation had been done by a man with sparse patience; paragraphs ended abruptly and then resumed on the next page as if they’d been standing there all along. Figures in woodcut, long-limbed fighters with bucket helms and elegant swords, demonstrated duplieren and absetzen with hands like the wings of flightless birds.

“The strong on weak, the weak on strong,” Edwin read aloud, and thought, All right then.

Sometimes he would look at the mirror on the back of his door and see a professor in sensible shoes, polite shirts. A man the students called Sir accidentally and his colleagues called Ed on purpose. He had a reputation, which is to say that people confidently misdescribed him when he wasn’t in the room. He wore that like he wore his slouch hat and the scars at his knuckles from an old woodworking phase. He had been married once, which made this sound as if it had been a hobby he was no longer serious about.

“Mad March,” his ex had said at the end, with sadness that mirrored his own. “You love ideas more than you love people.” He’d meant to contest that and somehow found his breath had left the room.

At lunch he ate a pie from the tuckshop tucked beneath the admin building. Two magpies hopped on the table with the boldness of small emperors. His soup-and-pie resolve to age gracefully had acquired a wobble.

“I’m taking the car to the servo after the 2 pm,” he told his reflection in the gloss of a takeaway coffee cup. “And then I’m ringing that club in Brisbane. Sword training. Beginners on Thursdays. To hell with the timetable.”

His timetable made a sound like someone sighing into a sleeve.

He joined a gym for a fortnight; this was a fact he hid like a thumbnail tucked into a fist. The gym smelled like lemon disinfectant and hums. He did not tell anyone. He did tell himself perverse things like, The first week is where you die and the second is where you notice everyone else has died and returned a bit stronger. He lifted light weights. He learned that his wrists still belonged to the younger man who had built bookshelves and mended bad chair legs and thought nothing of hauling his father’s old workbench across a patio. The rest of him wrote complaint letters to the Council.

“I am not twenty-five,” he told his left knee at the end of the second fortnight. The knee, unrepentant, replied with a dry pop.

On a Thursday he drove to Brisbane in a miserable rain and found a youth club hall with a sign that declared it had first been a dairy co-op. The room ran long and wooden, pale lights humming overhead. People gathered by the wall in a cloud of polyester bags and soft armor, masks that looked like metal mouths, long swords in narrow cases. He had brought the book as if he wanted to be caught out. He had packed it and then, out of guilt, unpacked it.

“Evening.” A man with arms like cable and a belly like a satisfied seal ambled towards him. He wore a black T-shirt stamped with white type—STAHL STURM, which Edwin said in his head with a flourish—and held a pair of battered gloves.

“Evening,” Edwin replied. “I’m…new.”

“Everyone’s new sometime,” the man said, and offered a heavy, careful handshake. “Branko.”

“Edwin.”

“Cool. Welcome, Ed. No, Edwin? We’ll do Edwin. That a German thing you’re holding, mate?”

“It is,” he said, because the book, of course, had somehow followed him after all and now warmed his hands. “Sort of. A translation. Bits. I’m a—”

“Yeah, prof. They always find us. Or the other way round.” Branko beamed. “We’ll get you sorted. Boots okay?”

Edwin looked at the sensible shoes he had worn into this punchline and smiled back, a small, wincing thing. “They grip the ground.”

“You say that now. Warm-up. Then we swing the steel. Well, not actually steel. We’re gentle. On purpose.”

It was possible to be both at once: ridiculous and serious. He stretched, he listened, he watched. They used blunt training swords made of synthetic composite, like someone had extruded a dream and spray-painted it. His partner was a young woman named Saffron with freckles across her nose like spilled pepper and eyes that locked onto his with a disconcerting kindness.

“You study math or something?” she asked, hopping on the balls of her feet as Branko explained a concept called the bind.

“Statistics. Mostly,” he said.

“My ex is a tradie,” she said, apparently as a counter-offer. “He told me to keep my elbows in. Looked it up. Turns out he was right.”

“Good to know.”

“It is. Elbows are traitors.”

They moved in, swords up, learned a guard called vom Tag that looked like someone about to scratch the back of their head with three feet of argument. He learned to step with his feet in ways that refused the rest of his body’s opinions.

“The first thing you’re fighting,” Branko announced to the room, “is your own brain.”

“That’s comforting,” Edwin said under his breath.

“No, it’s not,” said Saffron, and then she hit him on the shoulder with a tap that was as polite as an elbow in a lift.

He found that his wrists knew something after all. He found that when he performed a movement slowly, with a patience that made his breath curious about staying, the sword agreed. He also found a belt of aches, like a thunderstorm closing ranks.

Afterwards, as he stood outside in the rain, breathing air cooled by its own spill, he thought: This might be mad. He also thought: Good.

The drive back up the Range at night was the kind of work his father would have regarded as recreational. The lights of the highway curved ahead like someone had dropped a necklace and left it there for him. He arrived at his place—a weatherboard with an old veranda and a new garden that refused to be new—around ten. The neighbour’s light was on.

He had been in the house long enough to know a little about the neighbour and not enough to pretend he knew more. Her name was Aurelia Kavanagh, which she disliked, preferring Rel. She had a dog with ridiculous ears and a name that made absolutely no sense—Biscuit—and enough energy to power a small town if you could catch it in a jar. Rel’s hair was brown in a way that made every other brown hair feel inadequate, and she wore boots that suggested she had never met a puddle she couldn’t walk through on purpose.

“Evening, Professor,” she said from her front steps, raising a hand in their ordinary midnight ritual. Two months and they had landed here—waving in the night, exchanging meteorological observations and enthusiasms. She was in her twenties, he thought. Maybe early thirties. Age mattered until it didn’t.

“Rel,” he said. “Your dog is issuing a complaint.”

Biscuit, in the half-light, was galloping in place with a rope in her mouth as if trying to pull the house somewhere else. Rel regarded the tangle with affectionate dismay.

“She’s bored. I took her to the off-leash. She insulted a dignitary. We had to go.”

“There are dignitaries at the off-leash park?”

“Every kelpie thinks they’re governor-general.” Rel made a noise that might have been a laugh. “You look…worn.”

“I have been sword fighting,” he said, because how could you say it in a way that made sense, and then he watched the words arrive on her face.

She tilted her head. “You know that’s going to sound like you’re courting a concussion.”

“Possibly.” He found himself grinning. “It’s research.”

“Of course it is. What kind of sword fighting?”

He explained. Saffron’s elbows. Branko’s arms like cables. The old manual with its bird-limbed men. Rel leaned back, listened like someone under the eaves listening to rain and counting between the thunder and the flash.

“I helped out on a farm out near Pittsworth last summer,” she said when he finished. “Drove a quad around a split paddock. The old bloke had a son who did HEMA in Brissie. Brought a sword back at Christmas. You should have seen the grandkids. And the old bloke. Kid went right up in their estimation. Nobody expected the old man to, you know, play with it, but he did. Grew ten years younger in five minutes, then put his shoulder out opening a jar in January. That was a lot of fun too.”

“I would like to avoid the jar,” he said.

“You will not avoid the jar. But you’ll be grinning when you fail. I know that type.”

“You’ve never met my department head,” he replied, and almost said, He doesn’t think I have capacity for recreational concussions, only administrative ones.

She squinted at him. “They going to give you grief?”

He thought of the faculty room and how Lorna, who specialized in eighteenth-century coins and the politics of small holes punched in paper, had said, “At your age, Edwin?” without malice and with interest, the last tethered to the first like a balloon that didn’t know it could leave.

“They will find it strange,” he said, which was his way of saying, Yes, and I am wary of it.

“I’ll be loud on your behalf,” Rel offered.

“You can’t be loud on my behalf,” he said, baffled and warmed both. “That would violate all manner of unwritten codes.”

“Says who? The codes?” She let the rope go; Biscuit took off along the veranda and collided with a potted rosemary with the sound of a small storm. “Anyway. If you need an ice pack after any heroics, I have a freezer with ambitions.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means I over-invest in frozen peas.”

He went inside and stood in the kitchen because the kitchen sometimes told truths to him that the rest of the house avoided. The book sat on the table as if hoping for a meal. Edwin should have been grading papers. He made tea instead, the kind that came out of the tin like a small avalanche of black, rescued by water that had done its time. He cupped the mug and looked at his knuckles and thought about one more thing you could do to actually be a person, rather than a disguised committee.

It took three weeks for the unsupportive chorus to find its voice. Lorna began it, kindly enough, when she noted a bruise peeking out of his sleeve in a meeting and said, “Do we need to talk to HR?” and he said, “No,” and a hush fell like an extra curtain for a moment before everyone pretended to go back to discussing whether the new course code would be 2175 or 2185.

By lunch, the bruise had a name. “Steam-punk judo,” someone suggested. “Medieval cosplay,” someone else offered. “Does the university cover medieval injuries?” asked the head of school, emerging from his office with a sheaf of paper and a face like a man who had had an argument with his printer. He had the habit of speaking in a tone that made everything sound like a debit.

“The university covers what the university covers,” chimed Lorna, who did not entirely approve of jokes that required an undergrad’s idea of cleverness. She looked at Edwin with real concern. “Please do not break anything we need next semester.”

He could have said the thing he always said: that he was being careful. He could have told them about the way his whole body was paying him with attention, that he came home and felt inhabited, like someone had moved back in after a long sublet. Instead he said, “Under advisement,” and scuttled off to class.

“Yo,” said Mitch, who had a cricket’s haircut and half the vowels he needed. “Sir, is it true you’re, like, doing sword lessons?”

He blinked. “I did not know I had become content.”

“What?”

“On social media.”

“Nah. Heard it at the servo last night. My cousin’s in one of your cohorts. He saw you with a stick in your hand and a bin on your head and he sent a text.” Mitch grinned, showing the ambition for three teeth that were not present. “Anyway, that’s sick. My mum’s going to say that’s exactly what I need—discipline—but she says that about every weird thing.”

They laughed. He found that the students’ teasing touched him in a different way than his colleagues’ concern. Smaller. Less like a warning.

The second month of training entered his days the way summer gets into the curtains: gradually, then it’s the only thing that can stir. He learned to step into lines that had names like promises. He bought a cheap mask and a pair of gloves and left the living room just messy enough to convince himself it was lived in.

He trained also in his backyard, the sword making a sound in the crawl of evening like someone cutting citrus with a steel knife, that faint ring, and this drew a letter in his mailbox written in an outraged hand instructing him to refrain from the “clanking of wAr Implements” after nine pm. It was signed only “Concerned.” He looked up and saw, across the fence, Mr. Clegg’s garage door open like a mouth held in a grimace; Clegg himself peered out at Edwin through a crack and vanished. He had been a school principal once and had not retired so much as been retired from around.

“Oi,” Rel shouted from her steps, “if anyone is allowed to swing a sword on a Thursday, it’s the guy with a doctorate in not harming people. You know who I don’t trust? The ones who have a sword and a Facebook group.”

“Do not involve yourself,” Edwin called back, laughing despite himself.

“Too late. Also, Biscuit’s in the rosemary again.”

The dog emerged, wreathed in scent and contrition.

Rel, when he actually spoke to her for more than a couple of minutes, turned out to work at a vet clinic out on Anzac Avenue, the kind with white walls and cartoon paw prints. She wore scrubs with tiny bones on them sometimes, and other times she wore jeans and standing-all-day boots. She was finishing her prereqs for UQ Gatton, she said, the veterinary medicine program that had a waiting list like a line outside a bakery.

“So,” he said one twilit Wednesday, as they watched a plane move across the sky like a thought that had gone too far out. “You’re doing the long course.”

“Everything’s the long course,” she said with the cheerful savagery of someone whose dream had dated her patience a long while. “You know that.”

He did. He thought of his own long course—mathematics and then statistics, the way he had always gravitated to the matrix slices of life, neat lines of explanation until they weren’t neat at all. He loved teaching probability because people came alive when confronted with how bad they were at it. They felt tricked by their minds and then a bit giddy and then, sometimes, mad.

His ex-wife, Annette, sent him a text message on a Saturday that read: How are you? I heard about your new…hobby. If this is your mid-life crisis, you’re late. A smiley face had been appended with care.

He typed out three different replies. He deleted them all and wrote: I am mostly not an idiot. He hesitated. He pressed send. She replied with a heart that looked at him like a shrugging cat.

On a Friday evening in late spring, after his fourth or fifth training session that week (he had stopped counting, because counting is what you do when you want to make something flinch), he found himself in a bind with a man named Tony whose beard had its own opinion about gravity. The bind was supposed to feel like a handshake; in truth it felt like wading out until the water pushed against your thighs and told you how much more of you there was. “Feel,” said Branko insistently, walking past and pressing a hand at Edwin’s elbow. “Not think.”

He tried. He pushed his hands forward in a curve, a slice called zornhau that had a name like a last drink at the bar, and Tony responded, and something in the exchange made sense for a half-beat. Then Tony’s blade slipped under his and kissed his ribs with a clumsy sting. His breath tried to do something dramatic. He made it be ordinary instead.

“Good,” Tony said, and nodded, because HEMA people were generous like that—thieved praise from wherever they could and handed it along like a smuggled loaf of bread.

On the way home, he stopped at a servo and bought a bag of frozen peas. The boy behind the counter, who had a moustache you could uncharitably call theoretical, said, “What you going to do with those?” as a way of pretending he had time to laugh.

“Apply them to my mortal wounds,” Edwin said, deadpan.

The boy’s face lit. “Hectic.”

He slept poorly that night, because sleep had its own ambitions. He dreamed about his father’s old shed, which had smelled like oiled wood and a secret kept on purpose, and he dreamed too about the first time he had been asked to speak at a conference as a keynote, and how he had spoken in a voice he had learned as a boy and only realized, afterwards, wasn’t his own. In the dream, his father sat in the audience and clapped at the wrong times and then came up afterwards and asked him why he hadn’t spoken about the thing that made him speak at all. You can’t talk about that, he told the dream father, and the man said, Aren’t you tired.

In the morning, Rel knocked on his front door. He answered in a T-shirt that said QUEENSLAND MATHS CAMP and a pair of old track pants that made no promises to anyone.

“Ah,” she said with a smile wide as a fence. “A man of fashion. Can you hold a dog?”

“I can.”

“Ace. Biscuit’s got a burr in her paw. I tried the bribe method. She saw through me. She has a cunning heart.”

They sat on his veranda, in the part where the boards still remembered the last coat of paint and did their best. Biscuit set her chin on Edwin’s knee as if testing whether it was attached; her eyes went glistening and woe. Rel held the paw up gently. The burr was lodged hard and mean. Edwin cradled Biscuit’s head with his careful hands and talked to the dog as if she were a small student who had failed a test and thought it was the end of all of it.

“Rel,” he said, because he wanted to say her name in the morning, “do you ever get the feeling the life you’re in is lighter than the one you could have had, as if you picked it up and it surprised you with its empty?”

“Every Tuesday,” she said. The burr came out; Biscuit licked the air as if to praise them both. “And Thursday. And the first Monday of the other Mondays.”

“What about Wednesday?”

“On Wednesdays I eat cereal for dinner and believe in God.”

They laughed, the easy kind, and it was still there even when Mr. Clegg opened his door two houses down and shouted, “Some of us are trying to recover from the morning!” and Rel shouted back, “Good luck!” without even standing.

The first tournament announcement showed up at the club like a dare pinned to a wall. Southern Cross Invitational, it read, with a stylised star that looked like it had been cut out of tin. They were offering categories for longsword, sabre, rapier. “Beginner’s division,” Branko said to the whole dusty room, waving the flyer like a flag. “Also a ‘Veteran’ category, for those who have accrued a certain number of years. Be nice to take a few up from here. Represent.”

“Veteran?” said Tony, poking his beard as if it might answer. “You mean ‘ancient’.”

“Again,” said Saffron, “elbows are traitors.”

Edwin stood at the back and watched the paper be admired and thought, quietly, if he might. He had never been a competitive person in the way sport demands; even as a kid he had liked races where one person runs and then you hand the something to another and then they run and you all pretend it’s the same. But there was an itch in him now. It lived somewhere in the thin space between curiosity and shame. He could enter the Veteran’s Division. He could—the thought put a new weight in his pockets.

In his office, later that afternoon, with a student named Zahra sitting opposite him and curling a strand of her hair around a finger like it was a rosary for the patron saint of patience, he found himself smiling at nothing. “You want to tell me what confidence intervals are?” she asked, amused, “or have we entered a new era in which the professor would like to chat about his Saturday plans?”

He startled. “Confidence intervals are like…standing on your veranda and trying to guess the distance to a storm. You know it’s close if you can smell the rain. You’re not sure if it’s going to break on you or go on to someone else. You set a range. You hope you’re right with 95% of yourself.”

Zahra considered. “That’s not awful.”

“I’m a professional,” he said, prouder than he meant to be.

On the way out of the building, he ran into the head of school again, who was traveling with three mugs and a facial expression like the forecast. “Edwin,” he said. “A word.”

“A word,” Edwin echoed.

“I have had an email,” the man said, as if confessing a sin that was also a hobby, “from Facilities. Noise complaints in the evening in the residential area near you. Clanking. The word ‘weaponry’ was employed. Would you…look, this is not an issue as such, but we have faculty who would struggle to explain certain…eccentricities. May I ask you to refrain?”

Edwin looked at him and thought, Eccentricity is what you call any activity you can’t fit into your spreadsheet. He said, in a more manageable tone, “Of course.”

He moved the backyard practice to the afternoons, which had the added benefit of teaching him to sweat and to sweep the veranda afterwards without hating the broom for what it stood for. He bought a secondhand pair of fencing pants from a man in Ipswich who wanted out of the sport and into triathlons, that other refuge for people who cannot rest. The pants had a small patch on the knee where someone had stitched a smiley face in black thread. He left it there. He felt protected by its foolishness.

“Did you tell your family yet?” Rel asked one evening when they both happened, by the lazy geography of neighbours, to be sitting on their steps at the same time, making friends with the shadows.

“No,” he said. He thought of Annette again, her hand on the back of his head once, the way she had laughed at his attempt to fix a toaster as if he were a bear doing needlework. “There is not much family to tell.”

“I’d tell the rosemary,” she said. “It keeps secrets.”

The air tasted like next rain. Somewhere across town a footy crowd roared and then stilled in that way crowds do. Biscuit slept with her legs in the air, a creature absolutely without shame. He envied her.

The unsupportive chorus grew more specific and crueler in the way that only affection lets you be. “Don’t get hurt and leave us with your lecture load,” said Lorna. “My cousin’s cousin broke his femur fencing,” said Mitch, determined to invent a cautionary tale. “You’re going to end up on YouTube,” said one of the admin staff darkly, and then added, wistfully, “Would get a lot of views, though.”

Edwin smiled and nodded and became, to that same extent, more stubborn. In sorrow, he had learned to drift and endure. In this, he learned to push forward. It was the oddest thing, and he kept checking his pockets in case he had picked up a stranger’s certainty by mistake.

At the club, as December leaned into the heat, Branko began to shout things that were not exactly advice and yet somehow got in. “You are not a printer,” he yelled as Edwin tried to copy a movement and ended up with the ghost of it. “You are a person learning to make decisions with your body. You’ve got this.”

“Say more like that,” Edwin said after, sweating and a little dizzy from water he hadn’t drunk. “Say it to me when my brain goes quiet.”

“I can do that,” Branko replied. “Brains go quiet for a living around here.”

Tony clapped him on the back with a hand like a breadboard. “You going to Sydney for the Invitational?”

“Might,” he said lightly, as if he were discussing scones.

“You should. You need to get hit by people you don’t know. That’s how you learn you’re made of different stuff to what you think.”

“That’s encouraging.”

“That’s terrifying, yeah.”

On a bleary Wednesday just before Christmas, in a heat that made every conversation shorter by three words, Rel came over with a new haircut and a grin like there was some secret new street in town she wanted to show him. “I got in,” she announced, before he could say Hello. “Gatton. Starting next year. I’m going to be even more tired than I am now, which is an achievement. But it’s real. I’m going to be a vet.”

For a second, he thought she’d said something about rent. He was sun-stupid. Then it resolved. He stood and hugged her in a way that startled him with its ease, as if he were already a different animal.

“It is very lovely when the long course tells you it’s still the course,” he said into her hair.

“You say the weirdest true things,” she said, her voice a little breakable with joy. “You’ll have to throw a sausage sizzle or something. I’ll bring the salads so nobody dies.”

Mr. Clegg clucked in his throat as if to signal his disapproval to the pigeons. Biscuit did a lap of the garden as if demonstrating the new curriculum for happiness. Rel leaned back and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand in a gesture that should have been a cliché and wasn’t.

“You’ll make it,” he said, and he heard the word again later when he was alone, the way he had meant it more and he had kept it small so it would fit inside the day without cramping it.

The Invitational waited, patient and indolent, a letter half-written and left on the kitchen table overnight. He printed the registration form. He took it out and put it back in his bag. He signed it with the pen he kept for marking and realized it plotted its own lines. He did not tell the club; he thought he would mention it after he had sent the thing. He did not tell his colleagues; their faces would make a noise. He told Rel, because she looked at him with a way of seeing that did not require approval to function.

“Do it,” she said, when he explained it in a rush that made him sound younger and older at once. “You’re allowed to do some things without explaining them to a committee.”

“The universe has argued otherwise,” he said.

“Tell the universe to get in line. Also, I can stitch up a cut on your eyebrow if need be, if you can keep Biscuit from licking your consciousness away while I work.”

He laughed and sent the form.

At Christmas, he drove out to see his sister in Goondiwindi and sat under a fly spiral listening to the cousins talk about footy and how you can tell a storm is going to be useful by the smell of the dust before it. He didn’t mention swords. He did mention Brisbane summers, and someone snorted, and someone else told him that the man who used to run the hardware store had taken up ballroom dancing and looked happier than he had in a decade. “It’s the shoes,” his sister opined. “People’s lives change when they find the right shoes.”

He bought a pair of fencing shoes online that night in bed. They arrived two weeks later, white and foolish and so light in his hands that he laughed out loud alone in his kitchen. He put them on and did not look silly; he looked like a man who had taken a step somewhere else.

Rel came by with a bag of mangoes, because it was a duty in this part of the world to distribute sticky joy, and he told her about the shoes and she said, “That’s exactly what I mean about the shoes,” even though he hadn’t told her what his sister had said.

“You have ESP,” he said.

“I have a mother and four aunties,” she said succinctly.

The first time he sparred properly, mask on, everything he had learned flung into a tangle and then slowly, embarrassingly, sorted, he got hit three times in the same place by a teen with a baby moustache and the confident grin of someone who does not know their own impatience yet. He took a break and felt the heat press him down. He drank water and thought about the bind again—the point where your sword meets the other and the two lines become one, just for a breath, and you decide. Choose now, went the voice that had once sounded like a schoolmaster and now sounded like a helpful past self. He went back in and did not get hit in the same place. He got hit somewhere else. Saffron whooped and said, “Progress.”

When he came home with a graze along his arm sticky with a stripe of red and the kind of satisfaction that sits low in you so that walking moves it around, he found a note in his mailbox from Mr. Clegg. It read: This is a quiet street. Underline. It read: We have standards. Underline. It read: I am calling the Council if the noise persists. Underline under underline.

He took the note inside and placed it carefully under the leg of a table that had been wobbling for months. Then he made tea and took it out on the veranda and waited for Rel to come home, because he had discovered that her life moved in loops that included this hour, and that his own life, these days, permitted him to sit there and wait without feeling like he was failing at his job.

When she did come, in a swirl of tired hair and something like triumph tucked behind her ear, he said, “I registered.”

“For the thing?”

“For the thing. Sydney.”

“Hah,” she said, and threw both arms into the air. Biscuit jumped, responding to the universal cue of arms. “Good. Now. What’s for dinner?”

He looked at her, startled. “I have eggs.”

“That’s not dinner.”

“It can be dinner.”

“Only on Wednesdays.”

“It is Wednesday,” he said, and they laughed, and then she went back next door and returned ten minutes later with a paper bag that smelled like the best corner of town and a pair of chopsticks that had a red flower on the end. They sat on the steps and ate noodles; they burnt their mouths and drank water and said nothing for a while because you have to give joy its own wide corridor sometimes.

Sometime that week, his head of school sent a polite, well-structured email requesting a new course outline and the data for last semester’s pass rates. He replied with attachments and a line that read: Also, I will be away for two days in late March for a sporting event. The head of school took twelve hours to reply with the single sentence: Good luck, and please send the reminds for your classes. Edwin sat staring at the word luck and thinking of it as if he had to carry it in his hands without tipping it.

Two days later, in the club, Branko called him over after drills. “You going down to Sydney? Saff, Tony—you two as well?”

Saffron nodded, bouncing like a ball before a serve. Tony shrugged. “I put my name down so something would happen either way.”

“I am,” Edwin said, unable to keep the quiet pride out of the syllables.

Branko slapped his gloves together. “Beauty. We’ll do some tournament prep. Simulate stress. The whole shebang.”

“Oh,” Edwin said, light-handed and then, privately, in his chest, an entire amphitheatre of drums began to talk.

“Don’t look like that,” Saffron told him. “It’s only pain. Weep later.”

“I’m so glad I met you,” he informed her dryly. “No one else would have persuaded me of that.”

They put him up against strangers. They took him out of the careful patterns and into the place where everyone’s habits are new. He did badly and occasionally well. He learned that the habit of politeness can be a terrible idea in a fight. He learned that a thing he had read in the consistency of his own life—how mercy sits near the top of the pile—could move over for a few minutes while he understood how to be something else in order to do the thing he had set out to do. And all the while he understood why this looked, from the outside, like an unkindness he had not known he was capable of. The trick, he felt, was to know how to put it down again.

When he got home, sore and full of thoughts he could not fit into the night, Rel was on her step, reading a textbook the size of a brick about animal lameness. Biscuit snored like a single, righteous engine. Rel looked up. “You are entirely the color of cooked prawns.”

“A vivid description,” he said, dropping onto his own step and letting his body make its opinions known.

“Here,” she said, and got up and came back with a cold pack wrapped in a tea towel. She pressed it to his forearm with a gentleness that argued with the life she lived. “You going to talk about it or are you the strong silent type?”

“Strong talky type.”

“Ah. God help me.”

He talked. About the part where he flinched after the bell and about the split second after that where he felt a new thing come and live in him like the first time you take a road you didn’t know and it leads you somewhere. About how he felt ridiculous and luminous. About how he had been told off by Branko for apologizing to his opponent before the bout for the thing he might do if the bout went well.

“Don’t say sorry in advance,” Rel said. “That’s not how apologies work.”

“No,” he agreed. “It’s a habit. I’m breaking it. I can break it without becoming someone I dislike.”

“That’s the trick.”

He looked down at his hands, which had never looked heroic and now looked like they flipped through old mail a lot and occasionally did unusual tasks for their age. He had always thought of himself as a kind man. He had never thought to attach any other adjectives to himself; all had seemed either self-congratulating or self-mutilating. Now he thought: competent, sometimes. Now he thought: ambitious, a little. Now he thought: up to this.

Rel pressed the cold pack down again, firmer, smiling. “You have careful hands,” she said. “You’ll need that.”

Mr. Clegg’s window opened with the sound of a man winding his own spring. “People work in the morning,” he declared suddenly, generalizing the state of the universe.

Rel called back, voice syrup-sweet, “They really do!” and all the while her hand on his arm was resolute, as if you could convince the small hurt to go home by calm.

He slept that night like a person who has earned it, which is to say, he slept exactly the same as before and noticed it more. In his dream, he stood on a platform at Toowoomba station as a train came in and went out again, in both directions at once. He did not get on. He was not required to. The tracks held their glitter, then went dull again. When he woke, the sky was a candid pink, and Biscuit was doing enthusiastic laps around his yard without permission.

“Morning,” Rel called across the fence. “Do you know what a palmar digital nerve block is?”

“No.”

“You’ll learn,” she said. “We’ll all learn everything at once and then forget it on the day. That’s the way.”

He laughed, took his sword out under the jacaranda, and for once, when he raised it, no one arranged his body for him or told him to look out for the line; for once, he had a clear line in his head and it was going forward. An unsteady thing, yes. But forward, even so. The blade considered the light. The light, for once, approved.The heat came down like a sensible decision and then kept going until all the other decisions felt unnecessary. In the early mornings, before it got personal, Edwin took the sword outside and worked through the shapes with a patience that had improved since he stopped pretending he was meant to be good immediately. The jacaranda had done its purple rain and was now in the leaf-and-memory part of the year; the lawn wore a few wilting trumpets like medals from a campaign no one else had noticed. He had begun to think in little sequences—lift from vom Tag, step on the diagonal, feel the bind like a question mark pressed between you, decide—and it was the deciding that he practiced most. “Choose now,” he would mutter, then laugh at himself because the birdlife was not impressed and one of the miners on the line would chitter exactly like the word “nerd” said by a child. He took to finishing with a bow to nobody in particular, as if gratitude could be its own exercise, and then he would make the kind of breakfast that confessed it had never intended to impress anyone.

The university had its post-Christmas sluggishness, the campus emptied of undergraduates who had become beach creatures or hospitality workers for a season. In the lull, committees grew like mushrooms in damp corners. He found himself drafted to a working group about student retention in first-year quantitative subjects and listened to a PowerPoint explain that students did not like feeling bad at things and preferred not to come when they suspected they would. He thought of Branko saying, “Brains go quiet for a living,” and considered recommending a fenced bout after orientation to show them that survival is sometimes its own dessert. “We could get someone to fall kindly on purpose,” he suggested politely, and the head of school looked at him as if he had proposed a duel with the Vice-Chancellor.

Rel’s life accelerated the way paddocks brighten after the first good rain. She acquired textbooks with titles like Large Animal Medicine: A Practitioner's Compendium and spoke sentences that made his eyebrows attempt a pull-up. In the evenings she sat on her steps with a highlighter that had ambitions and Biscuit draped against her shin like a fur muff with an engine. “We did hoof anatomy today and I swear to God, there is an entire cathedral hiding in there,” she reported one night, pushing her hair back with the heel of her hand and pointing at an illustration that resembled a small city’s plumbing. He leaned forward and tried to assemble knowledge out of the diagram like a tourist refusing to look at the street signs, and she laughed and told him the one thing he needed to know was that everything is attached to everything else and that this is a mercy and a problem.

Noise returned in another form when a letter from Council, printed with the kind of gravity usually reserved for bins left out past their epoch, arrived with a request to be mindful of “evening activities of a martial character.” He read it twice and then went next door, where Rel was dissecting her dinner with the same attention she gave to textbooks, and held the letter like an exhibit. “Do you think I’m of a martial character?” he asked, and she took the paper and read it and then folded it into a paper plane with an efficiency that suggested she had held a few inferior memos in her time. “You are of a character,” she said, launching the letter down the porch where Biscuit snatched it mid-air and made off like a thief in a cheerful fable. “As for the martial bit, I would say you’re more of an alert librarian with a stick.” He kept the laugh for later and, in the afternoon, moved his practice to the hour after lunch, when the street was a white shimmer and even Mr. Clegg’s blinds had given up pretending they were meant to be open.

In the club, the air-con struggled with the room’s own intentions, but the drills grew crisp because there is a clarity to sweat when shared. Branko introduced what he called “stress peanuts,” which turned out to be timed exchanges with scoring and people watching and the clatter of the bell, none of which, he promised, would add up to the feeling of a tournament but would practice the idea of trying hard while your organs wrote letters to management. “You don’t need new moves,” he told Edwin after one fraught minute that yielded nothing but wind. “You need to decide sooner with the moves you actually have.” Edwin nodded and said that this was becoming an allegory against his will, and Branko grinned and told him that most sports were just allegories you could accidentally bruise yourself with.

He found himself partnered in these stress peanuts with a rapt young man named Darren who smelled faintly of aftershave and ambition and who asked, “What do you teach, sir?” in a voice that did not know yet that it would drop. Edwin told him, and Darren said, “I failed algebra,” as if confessing to having once stolen a lemon from a fruit stall, and Edwin told him that almost everyone had failed algebra at some point and the trick was to fail and then return with a better picnic. They touched blades and the bell went and for the first time in weeks, Edwin felt that he moved as a single verb. He even won the exchange, which produced a shout from Saffron and a nod from Tony and a small unclenching somewhere below his sternum that might have been a summer-specific organ finally allowed to perform.

Annette phoned on a Sunday because she had been rearranging the bookshelves and found the photograph of them at spring carnival, his hat a ridiculous ellipse on his head and her laugh caught mid-flight. They spoke as if passing cups through a window; it was easy the way familiarity permits kindness to choose the short road. “I watched a clip about your sport,” she said, and he braced for the wrongness, but she went on to say, “I liked the bit where they shake hands before trying to outthink each other with sticks. It seems politer than academia.” He told her she had not been in his staff meeting last Wednesday and she laughed in that way that makes the day remember itself. She said, “Please come out of the tournament with all your parts,” and he said, “I am not the part-losing kind,” and she said, “Everyone is the part-losing kind if the day is wrong,” and they let the silence after that work for them until the dog barked and he used that as proof that life wanted to go on making noise in the background while they said suitable things.

Orientation week returned with its tents and freebies and the kind of optimism that wrinkles under the sun and keeps going anyway. Edwin had been assigned a welcome talk for the cohort in first-year statistics, and he decided, on the morning of, to tell them one true thing that might survive the semester. He stood in front of them in a lecture hall where the air hummed with the ghosts of exams and said, “You will be wrong a lot in here,” which did the expected thing to the faces in row three, and then he said, “But we will be wrong in a way that teaches us how to be less wrong on purpose,” and he watched shoulders relax like dawn happening in small increments. He almost mentioned swords and the bind and how deciding in a fight is like deciding how to set your threshold for error, but he did not, because he had learned that if you add swords to anything before week three, the only thing people can hear is clank.

Rel’s schedule became a carousel with a crooked pole; the horse went up and down whether she was ready or not. Sometimes at midnight she would text him questions that were also invitations to be a person in the room: Is it monstrous to use a highlighter on a library book and then confess later, or is that how evil starts? Is Biscuit too clever to be happy? He answered with the seriousness her levity required—only monsters tear the corner off a page, highlighters are merely feckless; some creatures are too clever to be happy all the time, and those creatures need jobs—and she would send back a photograph of the dog asleep in a position that argued cranial emptying. In return, he sent her a picture of his fencing shoes on his kitchen table because he still could not get over their whiteness, their refusal to be from the same city as the rest of his shoes. She wrote: It’s the shoes, and he smiled in a way that put the night to work.

The letter about the Invitational turned into logistics with the speed of a new idea admitted as policy. Flights were compared, then discarded for a drive because Saffron didn’t trust airlines with masks and Tony had a cousin with a van and Branko had a playlist he described as “eclectic” in a tone that suggested he could be persuaded out of it. They would leave at four in the morning because the highway liked that hour; they would swap drivers every two towns because none of them trusted any of the others after three hours. Edwin volunteered to provide snacks and was given a list by Saffron that included the word electrolytes three times, which he took as advice from someone who had learned the same heat lesson often. He bought muesli bars with the texture of architectural compromise and freeze-dried mango that tasted like the aftertaste of itself, and then, out of guilt, he bought a bag of soft lollies that nobody sensible eats until the second last hour when all sense is gone anyway.

On a Thursday, in the furthest back corner of the hall, Branko pulled him aside and showed him a trick that was not a trick so much as an attention. “When you’re in the bind and you feel like a small god is holding both swords and could make either of you look the fool, let your left hand be a little more honest,” he said, adjusting Edwin’s grip as if realigning the day. “Your right hand loves to lie. It wants to do the glory. Your left knows the truth. Let it tell you.” Edwin nodded and tried it and felt the difference as a shift in the sentence his body was making. “You’re too literary,” Saffron told him, cheerfully, when he mentioned it. “Do the thing or don’t, but don’t explain it to yourself while it’s happening.” He told her he was working on the kind of quiet that could coexist with usefulness and she promised to believe him for now.

Mr. Clegg, having rung Council and discovered his influence was limited to the size of his letterhead, changed tactics in the way of men who believe themselves to be the weather. He took to sweeping his front path loudly at seven in the evening and pausing strategically at the point nearest Edwin’s fence, where he could cough with meaning at a volume that suggested an organ recital. One night, as the broom thumped and thrashed, Edwin stepped to the fence and said, in his best professor-to-parent voice, “Mr. Clegg, if the noise is the issue, I have moved my practice. If the swords are the issue, they are blunt and handled with care. If I am the issue, we are neighbors.” Mr. Clegg looked at him as if he had just defined neighbor in a language Clegg did not care for and said, “Standards,” and then went inside, leaving behind a path so clean the ants were writing letters.

He taped his thumb clumsily after a Thursday bout in which he grasped too high and found himself living with the consequences of enthusiasm. Rel repaired it with an expertise that made him wonder if she had stitched up half of Toowoomba under cover of darkness, and she told him to keep it clean and to stop apologizing to the tape as if it were a guest he had inconvenienced. “You’re brave about big hurts and embarrassed by small ones,” she diagnosed, tugging the end of the tape snug and squinting to check the color in the nail. “It’s common in professors and dogs who fall off couches.” He admitted to both and she told him the good news was you could practice one of those away.

The night before departure, the sky did the thing where it piled its opinions behind the horizon and then rolled them forward like an army that had changed its mind. He lay awake listening to the rain come across the roofs like a polite invasion and counted his gear in his head so he would not get up and count it in person. Mask, sword, jacket, gloves, underplastron, shoes, tape, registration, snacks, sense. He thought about what would constitute failure and was surprised to find his answer had shifted from points and bruises to something vaguer and larger, like coming home and feeling smaller than when he left. He had been smaller before and had not died of it, but he was greedy now for a self he could see from across a room and not pretend he had not noticed.

They met in the dark like conspirators who have been given permission by the night. Tony’s cousin’s van was a cavern with aspirations; it smelled faintly of oil and the remembered lives of sporting equipment. Branko handed around coffee in keep cups that claimed the world could be saved; Saffron wore a hoodie with a cartoon whale and the words Make Good Choices. They loaded themselves in a way that made sense only to those who had done it before. Edwin wedged himself between a bag that claimed to be waterproof and a crate of masks that rattled like the skulls of polite ancestors. “Everybody got their metaphor?” Saffron asked, to general groans, and then they were on the road, and the road did the thing roads do best, which is to pretend that all movement is forward and all forwardness is good.

The Range fell away behind them like a thought you had already used. Dawn did its gradual session; paddocks appeared and reorganized themselves around fence lines with their old arguments. They passed a servo where a sign declared in unpunctuated confidence that PIE AND COFFEE DEAL and they did not stop because they had packed virtue; they stopped anyway twenty minutes later because virtue is only an idea and the idea of pastry is more persuasive when it’s hot. “Eat the real food first,” Branko ordered, parental, as Saffron went to the counter with the energy of a pilgrim. Edwin bought a pie that burned him twice in the same place and a bottle of water that claimed to be from a spring that had never met a factory manager. “This is ridiculous,” he said to Tony, who agreed with his mouth full, and they stood under the awning and watched the light choose color for the day as if it were a question on a form.

Somewhere past Warwick, the conversation turned to rules in the way a car turns to gravel; not because it must, but because it feels right. “Remember,” Branko said, glancing into the rearview like a man who has taught himself to see in eight directions, “tip control. Don’t be the lawnmower. Show the judges you know how to stop. Don’t try to win exchanges after they’re dead. Don’t give the ref a reason to think your best quality is denial.” Saffron added reminders about not stepping out, about the way corners on a ring are hungry, about the way a person will look bigger if you assume they are. Edwin wrote things down in his head because he had long since stopped bringing a pen to anything he cared about; the act of writing as performance made him worse at the thing he meant to do.

He dozed and woke to the sound of Tony telling Branko about a time he had been hit on the mask so squarely he had tasted the design of the wire. “That’s how you know they were right,” Tony said with a philosophical cheerfulness that belonged to beekeepers and men who had been struck by lightning and come to consider it an anecdote. Edwin did not mention the dream he had fallen into, in which he stood at his father’s old bench, fingers on a plane he had once loved, only to realize that the blade had been put in backwards and that he had been burnishing, not cutting, and that this had been his habit for years. He woke with a sense of a small debt repaid to a past self and closed his eyes again to see if anyone would send a receipt.

They crossed the border in that unceremonious way that borders do when they are tired of being treated as the front of anything. The signs welcomed them with governmental cheer; the road gave no opinion. Saffron read aloud bits of the rulebook like nursery rhymes—on afterblows and priority and the way intention is judged by where the blade was when the judge blinked—and Edwin found that he was calmer in the presence of declared uncertainty. He drank water and looked out at the scrub and the sudden lake that arrived and left as if on a schedule it had written for itself and thought of Rel with her invisible cathedral of a hoof and her insistence on the jobs that keep a clever mind from punishing itself for existing.

At a lunch stop under a tree that had seen every road trip ever attempted, Branko set up two sticks in the dust and made them practice stepping around an invisible ring while keeping tip pressure on each other in a way that would have looked to any tourist like a rehearsal for a dance from a culture they would later misdescribe. “This is the bit no one likes,” he said, cheerful despite the sun. “This is the bit that wins you a point.” They bumped and apologized and stopped apologizing and bumped better. Edwin felt one moment of true decision as the length of his sword told him the next poem it had in mind, and he made the poem shorter and more useful, and Saffron said softly, “There you go,” and the sun said, “Later you will pay for this with sleep.”

They rolled into the city in the late afternoon, the sky an uncommitted blue. Traffic asserted that human beings organize themselves by estimate and anger, and the van joined the argument with the care of a person entering a family room where a long battle had been paused for dinner. Their accommodation turned out to be a weathered terrace with high ceilings and stairs so narrow that even their masks felt judged going up. They chose rooms with the diplomacy of people who know they will be living together without privacy for three nights. Edwin took the one at the front because he liked to look at streets that were not his and imagine the lives he would not live down there, and also because he could see a plane between buildings out the window and it made him feel temporarily connected to everyone leaving and arriving elsewhere.

He called Rel because the hour felt like a coin in his pocket and he did not want to forget it there. She answered on the second ring with the sound of Biscuit losing an argument with a toy in the background and told him that she had passed a quiz on ruminant digestion by writing a haiku to remember the four compartments of the stomach. He told her his room smelled like a previous tenant’s decision to fry fish without regard for history, and she told him that if he won he had to bring home an actual medal because Biscuit could not be expected to understand numbers on a sheet. “Also,” she added, quieter so as not to wake anything sleeping between them, “if you lose in a way that makes you bigger, that is the other win.” He leaned his head against the cool wall with its murals of past paint and told her he would do his best to find whichever version of winning the day would let him have. She promised to feed his rosemary so it would remember his name.

That evening, they walked to the venue to feel the floor, because feeling the floor is what you do when you’ve brought your future to a strange city. The hall was a slab of neutral with banners that tried too hard. People were already there in tracksuits that declared their clubs and friendships that declared their priorities. Edwin stood on the edge and watched a man show a child how to step and thought, unexpectedly, of his father’s hand on his shoulder when he was small, the heft of it and the way it had sometimes been too heavy and sometimes exactly enough. He rolled his shoulders and told himself that a blade and a body to hold it and a mind that could be talked to were everything, and the rest—bruises, points, bells, strangers—were gifts of a kind that not everyone knew how to open.

The night before the first bouts, they ate pasta because collective wisdom says that tube shapes make you brave. Saffron read the pools off her phone with commentary, Tony announced that his beard needed its own bracket, Branko told them where to be and when in a voice that could have organized a country. Edwin listened and let the names of his assigned strangers settle in him like the first sentences of a book he had been waiting to start. He washed his plate, because small obedience settles bigger nerves, and put his jacket out on the chair, and decided he would not check his gear again, and then checked it once more because decency demanded it.

He slept the way you do when the next day has promised to take notes about you. The city breathed in the sash windows; someone laughed on the street and then used the next laugh as a sorrow. He dreamed nothing, which felt like a mercy sent by a kind clerk. Before dawn, he woke and sat on the edge of the bed and put his feet on a floor that was not his and said, softly and for nobody to hear but himself and a building that had known worse tenants, “Choose now.” Then he stood and began the small work of before: toast, laces, the grease of a banana, the first joke of the day for Saffron, the second for himself, the breath that went in and decided to stay for a while.By seven the hall had taught itself to be louder than coffee. Volunteers in club T-shirts moved like early bees, laying out boundary ropes and clipboards and plastic chairs that would become thrones, confessionals and jury benches in one. The air smelled of floor polish and nervous fruit. Edwin signed his name at a trestle table where a woman with a plait as thick as a cattle rope stamped his card and said, “Veteran longsword, pool B,” as if this were a planet he would travel to and then come back changed. Equipment check made his mask a subject of public inquiry; a man with a sticker gun and the eyes of an electrician pressed fingers into the bib and tugged at the mesh as if hoping to coax out a confession. He stamped the forehead with approval and then, in the same motion, stuck an orange dot on Edwin’s sword with the care of a nurse applying a child’s band-aid.

Warm-up smelled like the first ten minutes of summer rain. People stretched their hamstrings and their manners; old friends clasped forearms and younger ones bounced in place, making vows to no witnesses in particular. Branko gathered them in a corner by a stack of crash mats and spoke while he wound a length of athletic tape around his thumb like a priest preparing an altar. “Remember your plan,” he told each of them, turning his head and voice like a lighthouse. “Saff, early pressure then withdraw to the lines you own. Tony, don’t argue with tall people, they can’t help it. Edwin, pick your one combination and be proud to be boring. If you must surprise someone, surprise yourself by stopping.”

The first bout he watched was a chaos poem. Two men in red and blue sashes ran at each other with the urgency of people who had forgotten their keys and then conducted a series of exchanges that were either elegant or mad depending on whether you had oxygen. Judges raised and lowered flags in a choreography that made him feel, briefly, as if he had spent his life in the wrong profession. When they called his pool to the far strip, his legs contained the good heaviness that announced their presence to him without asking permission to leave. He put on his mask. The familiar private space closed around him with the faint smell of old breath and detergent, the way an old car used to smell when he rode in his father’s ute.

His first opponent was a man with a neat grey beard and a posture that had been taught by a different teacher. The man lifted his mask and introduced himself as Mark and said, “I used to row,” which explained his shoulders and something about the patience in his eyes. They shook hands like colleagues about to argue in a friendly way and then stepped back onto the line, and the referee, a woman with a voice you immediately wanted in your life in crisis, said, “Fence,” and the world narrowed to a line from his heart to the tip of his blade and back again.

He did the thing he’d been told, which is to say he tried to do only one thing and to do it so cleanly it felt boring inside his own head. The first exchange he put out his point as if offering a question; Mark answered briskly with a parry that made Edwin feel like an overexcited letter halted mid-sentence. They met again and this time Edwin stepped in on the diagonal, the way Branko had taught him when both of them were trying not to swear at his feet, and found the bind and let his left hand tell him something true. He took the short line under and felt, more than saw, the tip land on Mark’s jacket just under the rib. The judge shouted, “Point blue,” and someone—Saffron, surely—whooped the kind of whoop that makes strangers grin. He acknowledged, stepped back, and immediately gave away a point by overreaching like a shopper who forgets about gravity. They shook between exchanges because both of them were old enough to find sincerity easier than theatre, and when the bout ended he had lost by a hair the width of a measurement error and breathed like a man who had been underwater and discovered that water, too, could be a language.

“Good,” said Branko, who had appeared like a useful ghost. “Now do that again without the losing. And check your line when you exit; don’t curate your mistakes like they’re an exhibition.”

The next bout he drew a woman with a ponytail threaded through the back of her mask and footwork that made him feel as if he had brought a sedan to a dance. “Hana,” she said cheerfully, and then she hit him twice with a timing he would have paid good money to borrow. He managed a single counter that the judges liked and two that everyone agreed were attractive afterblows. When they saluted, she leaned in and said, “Nice hands; your feet are lying,” and he laughed inside the mask, which sounds like someone else’s laugh living in your face. He stepped away with one more notch of humility, which turned out to be another name for appetite.

By the third fight his shirt stuck to him with the fidelity of a childhood friend. The hall multiplied its arguments and resolutions. He saw Saffron at the next strip, arms loose and sword talkative in her grip; she took a hit, shook it off like an animal coming out of water, and then sent a clean thrust up the line that made a judge mutter, “Lovely,” in the way of people who both care and perform not caring. Tony lumbered into his next opponent with a kind grace and did a textbook absetzen that was the opposite of textbook in its own rightness. Branko floated, commentating and quietening and occasionally clapping his hands in that particular way that makes a room remember it can have a spine.

Between bouts, Edwin stood with his mask off and his eyes closed just long enough to feel the sweat cool on his temples and the air change gear. An old man in a bright Hawaiian shirt leaned on the barrier like a patron saint of mischief and told him, apropos of nothing, that luck is just a name we gave to practice when we didn’t want to respect it in public. Edwin nodded and found a drink of water and made the ritual trek to the bin with a banana peel like a pilgrim taking offerings to an honest god. He texted Rel one word, Alive, and put the phone away before he could start treating it like a living amulet.

Pools finished the way storms do, with a last burst and then the sudden animal quiet. They posted results on a corkboard with pins that had to be pushed hard; everyone gathered as if knowledge were heat. Edwin traced the list and found his name placed in the middle of a middle, enough to go through to eliminations without any insult or miracle. Saffron punched his arm in the exact spot he didn’t need punched, apologized with the exuberance of the guilty, and then bounced away to gloat that Tony had taken a bout off a man who had arrived in a matching team tracksuit with a face like a surprise tax bill. Branko put his hand on the back of Edwin’s neck briefly, a gesture so paternal it surprised them both, and said, “Eat salt now,” like a doctor writing a prescription on a napkin.

Lunchtime turned the hall into a village green with plastic lacquer. People sat cross-legged on the floor and built sandwiches that were too large for their situations. Stories inflated and deflated. A woman from the Adelaide club told Saffron about a judge who had once fallen asleep, and the judge across from her looked wounded and asked for a name, and everyone laughed because of course he was joking and also of course he wasn’t. Edwin ate a boiled egg as if auditioning for a documentary and listened to the rise and fall of talk. He felt steadier than he had any right to feel at his age among other people’s opinions and made a private peace with the part of him that would always look for a rubric and a marking guide in any room.

Eliminations began with the ceremony of a school assembly and the raucousness of a backyard game. His first DE was against a man with a belly and the reflexes of a cat who had been born on a trampoline. They traded points like kids with marbles, valuable for reasons both believed and out of fashion. Twice Edwin drove him to the edge of the ring only to step out himself, caught by the hunger of corners. Once he stopped his point so beautifully after a hit that the judge chuckled and awarded him extra approval which could not be exchanged for points. In the last exchange, down by a point and breathing with effort, he felt the bind land exactly as if somebody had whispered now into his ear, and he took the short line again and stayed there, and the decision lasted long enough to get across the border into a point. He lost by one anyway. He saluted, shook, thanked, and then stood quietly at the edge of the strip while the adrenaline went away like a tide, leaving him with the exact shape of his nerves on the sand.

“Bigger,” said Branko gently when he came back to their little camp of bags and opinions. “You’re bigger than when you walked in, yeah?”

“I think I occupy more of myself,” Edwin admitted, surprised to hear himself say it without embarrassment. “I also think my shoes are now older than my sense of my shoes.”

“More salt,” Saffron said, handing him a cup of broth that tasted like a health inspector’s nightmare and a grandmother’s blessing. “You done for the day?”

“Veteran bracket continues after two,” Tony said, consulting his phone with the seriousness of a man checking weather for the survival of relatives. “You’re in the quarter, by the way. The points ratio. Mark got you there.”

“That’s a sentence,” Edwin said, and sat down because chairs were still inventions he trusted.

He texted Rel again and she sent back a photograph of Biscuit asleep under a chair with one paw extended into the light like a small patron saint and the caption: Meanwhile. He felt her in the city like a compass point, vulgar and essential, and put the phone away so he would not be tempted to store courage there and then fumble when he needed it.

Veteran quarterfinals were held on the middle strip, which felt like being called to speak in a room where you had been sitting happily at the back. His opponent wore a patch on his sleeve that said Newcastle in a font that might have grown up on the docks; he had the build of a man who could lift a dryer and the hands of someone who crocheted between battles. “G’day,” he said amiably, and then added, “I’ve got a knee that thinks it’s seventy-seven. If I go down, I’ll take the knee, not you, promise.” Edwin wished him luck and meant it, and then they went to work under the eyes of an audience that had grown noisier since lunch.

It was the cleanest fight he’d had all day. They measured each other with an honesty that felt like old-fashioned politeness and modern love of efficiency. Edwin landed the first with a thrust that would have made Branko stop pretending not to smile; the man landed a counter with the kind of aftertaste that makes you sit down later and reconsider your approach to doors. In the third exchange, Edwin stepped in on a half-beat he had been practicing in the tired part of afternoons on his veranda and felt the success arrive like a bird that decides your hand is not a trap after all. The judge said “Good” without raising her voice and Edwin filed that away for the difficult days. He led for a moment, then they were level, then down by one, then he took the short line and stayed there for two heartbeats and a point, and then time was called and they counted and it turned out that this, at last, was the kind of arithmetic he could love.

He won by a single flag, which is another way of saying he won because three people happened to blink in his direction with kindness and correctness at the same time. They shook hands; the man from Newcastle clapped him on the shoulder as if they were on a pier somewhere considering the tide, and Edwin stepped back and took his mask off and was surprised, again, by how bright the world was immediately afterward. He could feel Branko’s approval in his periphery like heat from a reasonable sun. Saffron screamed his name from wherever she was and Tony whooped in a manner that made a judge look up with faint disapproval before deciding to approve for the day.

Semifinal brought him a problem he had not yet solved. The man opposite him had a style that said, without embarrassment, that he would commit to a line and then sell you the second one in instalments. He was taller and younger in that way some men are, being fifty but having slept differently all those years. The first exchange Edwin tried to be boring and was punished by a hit that arrived like a well-worded complaint. The second he tried to be exciting and the man offered him a lesson in moderation he could tell his students about on Monday. The third he breathed, and it turned into something he could live with; he found the bind and told the truth with his left hand and came away even. They traded for a while, and then a warning for stepping out made his left foot cautious when it needed to be useful, and in that hesitation he felt the astringent taste of a choice not made. He lost by two and shook and saluted and walked away with the knowledge that regret and satisfaction can live very close together without burning the house down.

The final happened without him but around him, which is a kind of belonging he had not expected to enjoy. He shouted for the man from Newcastle because the draw of familiar courtesy was strong, and when that man lost, he shook his head with the serenity of someone who was already rewriting the story for his club in a way that would nourish everyone. Branko thumped Edwin’s back and said, “Bronze fight?” and Edwin blinked because he had not known there was such a thing, and then he was back on the strip with a man who had eyes like a magpie and a grin as quick as gossip.

Bronze turned out to be a gift that asked something in return. They were evenly matched in impatience and courtesy. Edwin stuck to his one combination like a man clinging to a raft and found that sometimes rafts get you where you need to go. He took a hit he felt a day later and gave one he would remember on the drive home, and when the ref called halt at the end, the points landed on his side like coins in a busker’s guitar case. Someone put a ribbon around his neck with a disc of metal that made a sound when it knocked against his sternum, and he had the absurd, unfixable urge to look around for Rel as if bringing his neighbour into the city by craning his neck would make any sense. He settled for looking up at the vaulted ceiling and listening to it answer back with the gentle echo that only busy spaces know how to make.

He had never been a medal person. He had never been a person who cried when strangers applauded. He did neither and then felt foolish enough not to be ashamed of the absence. Saffron hung herself around his shoulders in a way that threatened the laws of both physiology and the Australian fencing federation; Tony shook his hand solemnly as if this were a bank. Branko made eye contact across the mess and gave him a nod that said, in tutor’s code, that the ratio of effort to result had been respectable and that the narrative would play well in the car later. He slipped the medal inside his jacket because he was not ready to be a person who put metal out where the light could bully it.

The day rolled on under the weight of other people’s adventures. He judged a pool for rapier and discovered that the sequence of raising a flag, lowering it and writing down numbers had its own music. He saw a young woman burst into tears after a loss and be comforted by three separate clubs, each with a different recipe for sorrow. He watched a boy in a too-large jacket get hugged by a coach who did not need to be told that boys are not plants and cannot be constructed out of silence and fertilizer. He stood in a corridor and ate a muesli bar that had the generosity of pressed birdseed and thought about the beautiful foolishness of human beings deciding to invent rules for hitting each other because it made the improving of ourselves easier to quantify.

At some hour that the sun had given away in exchange for the work of others, they decanted themselves from the hall and went in search of food. They ended up in a place with pictures of bowls on the wall, immediate and entirely accurate advertising, and ate until the conversation slowed and gentled and lay down like a dog near the fire. Saffron told a story about a bout in which she had forgotten which hand she preferred and used both with equal incompetence and mirth; Tony demonstrated, using chopsticks, a technique he had seen online and had yet to get to agree to be real. Branko took a photograph of them all with the kind of managerial tenderness that high school teachers have on school camp when no one has gone missing or confessed to a felony after nine pm. Edwin sent a copy to Rel, who replied with a photograph of Biscuit with the medal around her neck, asleep and snoring like a kettle coming just to the lip of boil.

Back at the terrace house he took the medal out again when the others had engineered sleep and looked at it properly. The metal was cheap because it had to be; the ribbon was red because red makes decisions simple. The thing it stood for did not fit inside it, which he found soothing, because that meant he could let it be small without committing a sin against the larger thing. He placed it on the chair where his jacket had been, because chairs understand waiting, and sat at the window, looking out at the street performing its own small night. In the room across the hall someone shifted and sighed; the house creaked around a heat that only older buildings know how to keep under conversation.

He slept as if he had been bribed. Morning came with a throat of birds and the clink of cups from a kitchen with tile opinions. The second day was for teams and for the kind of spectator work that lets your heart rate leave your neck and go back to wherever it usually does its job. Edwin volunteered to judge because he had discovered that holding a flag quietened the part of his mind that wanted to roam around and find things to regret. He stood at a corner and watched a team from Perth do something clever and then something stupid and then something brave, the classic triptych. He learned the names of two judges’ children and the price of kettlebells in this city and the fact that if you hold yourself a certain way while wearing a mask in the heat, you can smell your own life with a frankness that would be impolite at any other time.

Between breaks he called Rel because he wanted to hear an ordinary voice. She was in the car, parked out the front of the clinic because someone’s cat had refused to be released and they were timing their caution. She told him a story about a sheep and a bucket that he would have taken to his grave if he had not already made space for other valuable things. He told her about the medal because he was secretly eight; she told him she would make the rosemary wear it as a warning to other herbs. They were quiet a moment, the kind of quiet that puts pillows underneath itself, and then she said, “You did the thing,” with pride that had no ownership in it and all the connection. He told her he had done a portion of the thing and planned to remain alive long enough to see what other portions existed, and she said, “Good,” and then had to go because a cat with opinions had made a new one.

On the drive back Branko put on his playlist and it did indeed contain both yodelling and a woman with a voice like smoke rolling off a new fire. They stopped at a servo with a pie warmer that had seen revolutions and bought ice creams because sometimes you must. Saffron fell asleep with a mouthguard case balanced on her belly like an egg; Tony told Edwin about his first marriage with the matter-of-factness that emerges when you are thirty-three hours into a project. The highway did that thing where it becomes the only thing in the world for a minute and then admits that trees and cows and the occasional offended ibis exist, and then went back to being a sentence with commas for exits.

They reached the Range in the long light, everything gold enough to make poets insufferable. The van sighed in the driveway like a dog who knows which house is home. They carried gear inside with the ceremony of relief and then separated with noises in the tribe of tiredness. Edwin drove across the last little bit of town to his own street with the care of a man returning something fragile to a shop to ask for a different color. He parked, picked up his bag, and looked automatically for Rel’s light, and there it was, in the window that had already volunteered to tell him about her life.

She was on the step with a textbook open on her knees and Biscuit at half-mast asleep, paws twitching with dreams that must involve paddocks and minor dictatorships. He walked up the path and she looked up and the grin happened, a simple rearrangement of her face that always took a piece of his fear and asked it to wait in the utility room. He sat down by default because his body remembered the agreement the steps had made with gravity. He took the medal out and held it between them like a saucer with its own weather.

“That’ll do,” she said, and took it and turned it over and then put it around her own neck and posed as if informing a room of unhelpful seniors that she would be taking questions in her own good time. Then she put it on Biscuit, who woke enough to snuffle it, decided it was not edible, and went back to constructing a better dream. They sat quietly for a minute because the light was doing work on the gum across the street and Mr. Clegg’s blinds were admitting defeat.

“Did you decide?” she asked eventually, flipping a page with her thumb as if it were a coin.

“More often than I failed to,” he said. “And I failed to less often than I thought I might. Also, I discovered that I like judges when they agree with me and that I call them ref when they don’t, which is a piece of psychology I should have noticed earlier.”

“You’ll be hell in Senate meetings now,” she said. “All this decisiveness. They won’t know what to do with you.”

“They will form a subcommittee to study it,” he replied, and they watched the sky go from a blue with a high opinion of itself to a blue that conceded other colors existed. In his pocket his phone buzzed once with a message from Annette that was only a picture of a kettle and three exclamation marks, which he understood to mean that she had guessed the result. He sent back the neutral, kind summary he had promised himself he would always give to people who had been obliged to love him for a while and were no longer obliged but sometimes chose to anyway.

Mr. Clegg opened his door, looked out at them both as if they were being delivered by a service he hadn’t ordered, and then closed it again with the fierce dignity of a curtain falling. Rel rolled her eyes at a magnitude only visible from the veranda. “We are scandalous,” she declared softly, and then found his forearm with the back of her fingers and pressed, a quiet check-in. He realized, not for the first time, that friendship is a verb and that this, too, had been in the manual all along, between the pictures of men in unconvincing hats.

Monday resumed its civic duties. He went into the university with a bag that felt heavier because it had a funny story in it, and the corridors smelled faintly of laminate and relief. Lorna caught him by the mailboxes and lifted an eyebrow in a gesture that had looked at better men than him and adjusted their tie. “If you walked into a swordfight and walked out again with more than you took in,” she said, “you’ve done better than most working groups. Congratulations. Did you do any of those fancy moves with German names? Or was it all statistics with sticks?”

“Some of both,” he said, and she nodded, satisfied in a way he could not quite read. The head of school passed them carrying a stack of folders and offered, astonishingly, a thumbs up he immediately regretted; they pretended not to see his regret. In his office the gum did its work on the light and the students’ emails lined up politely and the tea tasted like a small reasonable idea presented at the right time. He took the medal out, because he was still ridiculous, and hung it on the back of the chair in exactly the place where a tie might go if he had ever become that man.

In class he found himself explaining hypothesis testing with a little more muscle than usual. “You walk in believing one thing,” he told them. “You set yourself up to be contradicted kindly. If the evidence cuts you, you thank it and use a bandage. If it doesn’t, you go home and avoid getting cocky because the day will come.” Mitch asked him if this meant statistics was a contact sport and he said no, not unless you count emails, and the class laughed as if it were possible that knowledge and joy had been introduced in the library and hit it off.

Afternoons came back to the veranda like a returning habit you had given your blessing to. He practiced for less time and with more interest. The jacaranda learned his shape and made no complaint. Occasionally a car would slow as it passed and then speed up again, embarrassed by its own curiosity. Rel would appear on her step with a stack of flashcards that had on one side words like sesamoid and on the other, improbable mnemonics that could only have been born in a mind that had prowled its own premises with both patience and a torch. He quizzed her on tendon anatomy and she quizzed him on when to stop apologizing, and Biscuit stole a glove and made a circuit of the garden like a thief pursued by bad detectives and modest regret.

A week later, when the adrenaline had been metabolised into jokes and the bruises had become conversational rather than emphatic, a parcel arrived from the tournament organizers. Inside it was a photograph taken by someone skilled who had caught him in profile at the exact moment before a decision. In the picture, under the mask, his mouth was not set in the old boy’s line he had learned at school; it was soft and open, interested rather than defended. He stood with the left hand honest and the right for once not lying, and his legs in an arrangement that promised faithfulness. He took the photograph next door because some things wish to be witnessed by the same eyes that watched you carry your groceries on the wrong day. Rel put it on her kitchen table and frowned at it as if it were an equation she was fond of and determined to beat.

“You look like yourself,” she said finally, which was the only thing he had wanted to hear and the only thing he hadn’t known to ask for. He left the photograph there for a day because her kitchen had a better opinion of light, and then he took it back and pinned it to his office corkboard between a flyer for the student mental health service and a cartoon someone had drawn of him wielding a whiteboard marker like a culprit might wield a spoon.

Council sent another letter printed on heavy paper that sat upright with self-esteem and asked residents to be mindful of parking on bin days. There was nothing about weapons in it, at which he chose to be pleased. Mr. Clegg began to nod at him if they both happened to be adjusting their bins at the same time, an improvement that, like all improvements, came with the suspicion that it might be temporary. Annette wrote to say that her sister’s boy had taken up archery and that there must be a subset of maths lecturers for whom pointy things were not so much a hobby as a gentle method of aligning themselves to the planet. He wrote back that string tension had a lot in common with hope and then worried it was too much and then let it stand because what else had the last months been good for if not to practice choosing and then living with the choice.

On a Sunday, the kind with a breeze as official as permission, he drove out past Highfields with Rel and Biscuit to a quiet park where no one would write civically worded letters. He brought the synthetic sword but left it in the car after five minutes because the grass was damp in that way that reminds you that weather is a participant, not a backdrop. They walked the path while Biscuit galloped ahead and then back and then ahead again, an algorithm written in joy. Rel told him about a farmer who had cried over a cow and the vet who had cried after he left because there is only so much professionalism the body can store. He told her about a student who had written, in neat block letters, that she had failed everything and then had not failed this, which he had printed out and put in a drawer to take out on the nights when a university looks like a warehouse for faded ideas. They sat on a bench and split a sandwich as equitably as people who like each other and do not insist on exactness and watched a small boy try to convince a magpie that bread was currency. The sword stayed in the boot, which was its own kind of wisdom.

The club met on Thursdays and sweat always at the same spots appeared like old friends. The room had begun to feel like a second library, with borrowing and returning happening in the language of muscle. Branko introduced a new drill that was exactly like an old drill except for where you decided in it. “I will keep moving the door,” he said, unapologetic. “You will keep learning to walk through.” Saffron had acquired a pair of knee socks with tiny flamingos and wielded them like authority whenever someone needed scolding about hydration. Tony shaved his beard and they all forgot his face had a chin and spent an evening congratulating it on its emergence. Edwin found that his hands arrived at positions before his sentences did and took this as proof that something in him had adjusted not to violence but to its rehearsal as a way of knowing himself further.

He fixed a chair that had wobbled for too long and then sat in it, alone, and allowed himself the private drama of staring at nothing for five minutes with the certainty that it counted. He wrote a lecture slide that described the p-value without benefit of metaphor and surprised himself by liking it more than his better lines. He moved the medal around his house like a saint’s relic, trying it on different shelves to see where its small gravity held things correctly. He found that, like the rosemary, it preferred the kitchen where kettle and knife and board conspired to make life possible with minimal heroics.

Late one evening, with the heat finally conceding that sleep existed, he and Rel sat on the steps and counted satellites. The world arranged itself in a way that suggested arrangement was not beyond it. He told her the thing he had not said to anyone else, which was that there was a moment, on the strip, when the bind had felt like the exact shape of something he would once have called prayer and then had stopped calling prayer for the sake of an argument he had not, in fact, needed to win. She did not make a joke or tell him he was being indulgent; she nodded and scratched Biscuit’s ear and said, “I know that bit,” as if they had been to the same out-of-the-way town. They talked about nothing for a while and then about the price of petrol and then about whether Biscuit should be allowed onto furniture where friends might sit in white shirts, and then they went inside at an hour that would make the morning reasonable and the night not feel short-changed.Autumn arrived like a woman who had sent a text in January and only now received a reply. The heat conceded not in apology but with the faint air of having misread the situation. Early mornings took to letting him see his breath for a moment on the veranda, the way the kitchen sometimes lets steam drape itself over a mug just to remind you that it has opinions. The jacaranda, indecisive and ornamental, kept a few late flowers out of habit, making the lawn look like a letter to purple that the post had finally agreed to deliver. On a Tuesday the sky went a colour that suggested it had run out of options and then, with no preamble, the storm came through like a school inspection. The gutters gulped and failed; Biscuit held a referendum on thunder and decided, as usual, that the government was illegitimate; lights flickered and then made up their minds to be off.

Rel appeared on his veranda carrying two candles in jars, the kind with a label that promised cinnamon and hope. “Power’s gone from half the street,” she said, water on her eyelashes like punctuation. “I was going to do an anatomy quiz in the bath and now I have romance lighting and a dog who thinks lightning is a personal attack.”

“The dog is correct,” he observed, and took one candle, which made his kitchen suddenly behave as it had been born for a different century. The fencing manual on the table, with its smell of other men’s sheds, accepted the light as if it had been waiting for this arrangement of photons. He flipped it open and found that, in the margin next to a woodcut of two men exchanging opinions with long blades, someone had written, in pencil so faint it had been almost elected to invisibility, the words: Don’t bite on the first soft. Over the page, in different hand and firmer graphite, a name: J. Willoughby, 1956, with a flourish after the six as if the number had got ideas. He had never noticed the inscription because he had been reading for the shapes of things and not their shadows.

Rel leaned in, candle light making her irises do their own reenactment of stars. “Who’s Willoughby?”

“I don’t know,” he admitted, touching the letters with the tip of a finger as if the paper might do the kindness of remembering. “But he wanted 1956 to know he had been in it. And he liked telling himself not to bite.”

“Good advice,” she said. Thunder said that it would be providing percussion without further consultation. “Also, there is a very old man two doors up who may be about to call the army. I saw him go to the fuse box like he knew it personally. If we see flames, we stage an intervention.”

They laughed, but when the lightning did the long rattle that makes windows want to be somewhere else, they both glanced, by habit now, at Mr. Clegg’s driveway. His garage door was shut like a mouth trying to hold its own teeth in. Biscuit’s dread translated into a desire to herd the lightning into a corner; Rel put a hand on the dog’s collar and spoke words that were kindness disguised as stern.

It was ten minutes later—storm in its second argument—when a sound came that was not thunder or rain but a dull, human suggestion of the world failing to obey its worker’s safety plan. Edwin looked at Rel and she was already on her feet. They went out into the white hiss, across the yards the way people do when the rule that separates domes of privacy temporarily evaporates. Mr. Clegg’s front door was open by an opinion’s width. Rel knocked, called his name in her nurse voice, which, he realized, was different to her everything else voice by a degree that admits someone else’s panic and then prohibits its right to rule. No answer. She pushed; the door gave with a moan that might have been narrative or weather.

Inside, the hall smelled of carpet and old polish and a soap that had been discontinued and replaced several times since it was bought. The lounge room was a geometry of square furniture that had known the same hands for decades; Mr. Clegg himself was on the floor in a position a teacher would have corrected in any child and forgiven in any adult. His face was a flustered white; one leg lay at an angle that would not be in any manual a sensible body had ever produced. Edwin felt the cold knock of adrenaline and then its chastening hand on his back telling him to be precise. Rel was already down at Clegg’s shoulder with the practised calm that has to be taught but can’t be faked.

“G’day, Mr. Clegg,” she said, as if they were queueing together at the post office, “I’m Rel from two doors down. The weather’s showing off and you appear to have picked an unhelpful angle. Don’t move. Can you tell me where it hurts?” She flicked her eyes to Edwin. “Ambo?”

He had the phone in his hand before she said it. He gave the details to a kind voice that asked him to check breathing and consciousness in a tone that never once questioned whether he could. Rel kept her hand steady on Clegg’s wrist and told him ridiculous truths in a quiet stream—the storm would end, the ambos were on their way, Biscuit wanted to apologize for every noise she had ever made. Mr. Clegg blinked at her and then, willfully, at Edwin.

“I slipped,” he said, the word full of the disgust of a man who has never forgiven himself anything that wasn’t planned. “Bloody slippers. I never wear them. I wore them.”

“We all have days when our shoes betray us,” Edwin told him, because there was perhaps no better news he could provide. “The floor, too. Floors relish a human downfall.”

There was a breath that contained the ghost of a laugh. They waited through the long minute that always happens between telling an emergency and help arriving, each second doing the work of two. The storm kept speaking; the power stayed out. The ambo lights hit the front window like a polite alien visitation and then the ambos were in the room, efficient in the manner of people who have no interest in drama and every interest in result. Rel said her piece with the zip of someone who’d had to present jovial heartbreak to supervisors; Edwin stood out of the way and put Biscuit’s collar around his wrist because the dog had decided she was now qualified to assist with either diagnosis or sawbones.

“Hip,” one of the ambos said with professional regret, feeling down along the line of Clegg’s defiant leg. “We’ll take good care of you, sir. Always the days with weather, eh? Houses have opinions about gravity when the sky has opinions about thunder.” They packaged him in a way that felt both respectful and temporarily mechanical and then he was gone into that rain in the care of people who had memorized whose hands did what in what order.

In the sudden quiet that followed, Rel wiped her forehead with the back of her wrist and sat back on her heels like someone who had just played a fair game with an old enemy. “Well,” she said, and the single syllable contained relief, fatigue, and that odd little joy human beings keep aside for when they and strangers have made a useful shape together. “If he comes home and calls Council, I swear to God I’m going to give a speech about standards at his next lunch.”

“He will call Council to thank them for sending the evening weather,” Edwin said, and then felt a wash of something embarrassing and true. “You were…you were everything that should be done.”

She shrugged with a smallness that people who actually do things have when congratulated. “I had an uncle who fell off a ladder because television aerials require men to feel like emperors. After that I made it my job to know where a wrist is.”

The power came back in a grumble. They stood in the front room of a man who had spent months composing letters about decibel levels and felt oddly like trespassers in a museum of one person’s taste. Rel straightened a photograph on the mantel of a woman in a dress that had not been fashionable for half a century and asked, softly because it mattered, “Was she his?” which was the kind of question that could mean wife, sister, life. Edwin said he did not know and believed that, perhaps, one day Mr. Clegg would tell them because the alternative was that he would not, and there is a dignity to the undisclosed as well.

After the event, the street knitted itself up around the hole of the ambulance as if there had never been an opening. The storm moved on with the guilty conscience of a thing that has exercised its right to exist. Biscuit, resolved to try being brave as a part-time vocation, did a patrol of the veranda and accepted a biscuit as if wages had been negotiated in advance. Rel took her jar back across; he kept the other and put it on his kitchen table, lighting it again for a minute even though the lights were back, because it seemed polite to make the room remember that softness had been available.

In the morning he phoned the hospital to see if they would tell a neighbour anything. They would not, but sometimes they do and it means the same thing as when they do not. He left his number and the words “if he wants the bins done” and considered that this was how you paid a small portion of the enormous debt owed to anyone who called an ambulance because they were in a situation that preferred to be ignored. He set the bins out anyway, careful of the angle of the wheels because that was a kind of sacrifice Mr. Clegg would notice and approve with his eyebrows.

Work, having been paused for weather and injury, returned more certain of itself. The working group on quantitative retention met in a room that smelled of biscuits but offered fruit as an apology. Edwin went in with the list in his pocket of all the important things he had learned since he last sat with these people: that left hands tell truths, that standards are strangers until you need them, that there is a kind of decisiveness that is not a weapon but can be mistaken for one. The head of school had a graph and a frown; Lorna had an anecdote about a French university and a bag that could be used as a siege engine. They were discussing the introduction of a pilot project for peer-assisted study when Edwin heard himself say, in a voice he had not previously lent to committees, “What if we stop trying to fix students by pretending not to be students at the same time?”

There was a silence that felt purposeful. Lorna tilted her head at him as if he had just offered a coin of a denomination she would be sad to see go out of circulation. “Explain,” she said, generous as a judge who knows they will be agreeing at the end but is here for the process.

“I have been watching myself learn something where other people are better,” he said, choosing his nouns and verbs carefully, “and the things that help are honesty about failure, kindness that is not indulgence, and making decisions early with whatever skills you already have instead of hoarding them for later on a day when you believe you will be braver. We could teach first-years to announce what they are bad at in week one and then reward the act of making early, small decisions with their learning rather than judging them solely on whether they guessed the point correctly in week thirteen.”

The head of school blinked as if someone had just opened a window he had always insisted was painted shut. “You’re proposing we assess process,” he said, wary like a cat being offered an unknown fish.

“I’m proposing we harness stubbornness,” Edwin replied, surprising himself with the cheerfulness in it. “Our students are very good at being stubborn in the wrong direction. Let’s redirect.”

By the end of the hour the group had a poorly named subcommittee and an excellent list that, because Lorna had adopted it and pronounced it hers, would get done. As they walked out into a corridor that had stored summer and was now redistributing it to everyone fairly, she bumped his shoulder with the narrow confidence of a woman who had been right most of her life. “Brave,” she said. “Don’t get used to that tone or you’ll be put on panels.”

In the club, the mood was bright with the particular post-tournament malcontent that always resolves into humour. Saffron had a bruise that looked like a map of Iceland and insisted on showing it to anyone who wasn’t even a little curious. Tony had decided to grow the beard back out of respect for his chin, which had proven disconcertingly expressive. Branko looked at Edwin with the kind of measuring he reserved for when one of his people had stumbled into a new corner of themselves and needed help finding a stool.

“You ever try running basics?” he asked casually, as if basics were a generous dog that could be trusted to take itself for a walk.

“I supervise first-years,” Edwin said, smiling because he knew what was being offered. “I can watch feet try to betray their masters.”

“Good,” Branko said. “Get you to do footwork on Monday with the fresh lot. They trip over themselves and then we teach them how to trip over the right bits.”

The idea sat in Edwin like a small bird that had been driven into a house by weather and found a high bookshelf not to panic on. He took the beginner class with a politeness that made Saffron yawn theatrically from the advanced end of the hall. He discovered, to nobody’s surprise but his own, that he could explain diagonal steps without a whiteboard and get grown men to concentrate on their toes with the seriousness of people being introduced at last to the concept of apology. “Your job,” he told them, “is not to win against each other. It’s to stop convincing yourself that your brain has given your feet all the information. Your brain is a politician. Your feet are the civil service. Respect them.” After, Branko patted him on the shoulder with the smugness of a man who had known this would happen and wanted the pleasure of seeing it from the right seat.

Rel, meanwhile, began to wear exhaustion like a piece of jewellery she would pawn if the shop were open. The commute to Gatton was not long, but fatigue has a way of adding kilometres to any road if not told to sit down. She sent photographs of cattle with the expressions of philosophers and of a model horse leg with more lines drawn on it than a full bench of graph paper. She ate in a way that admitted food had theoretical value. One evening he knocked on her door with a frying pan full of eggs and a loaf of bread under his arm and said, “I am aware of the Wednesday rule. I propose a waiver.”

She looked at him with the gratitude that people reserve for electricians who arrive on time in a storm. “God bless bureaucracy,” she said, and let him in. They ate at her kitchen table like people who had finished working on a fence for hours and were too intelligent to explain what they had done. Biscuit watched with an expression that said that eggs, while not her preferred currency, would be accepted if someone provided convincing arguments. Rel told him about a lecturer who had described the rumen like a cathedral and then, in the same breath, confessed to praying in his car. She told him about a student who had lost a goat and found it again by listening for the sound of someone complaining excellently. He told her about a boy in his class who had answered a question with such unexpected clarity that the whole lecture hall had briefly stopped pretending not to enjoy itself.

On a Saturday, with the heat only making polite comments, Edwin returned to the second-hand shop on Margaret Street because sometimes when a name appears in your house it asks you to do something with it. The bell on the door resignedly performed its function; the same shelf of romance paperbacks offered the same coy faces; the same tub of cords claimed to connect the world if only someone would propose a constitution. He took the manual and the faint pencil line to the counter where a woman with a wrist tattoo of a tiny bird typed his soul into the computer like someone reserving a seat on a bus.

“J. Willoughby,” he said, as if ordering a coffee. “Ever come across the name?”

“Mister Willoughby,” she said in the tone you use when someone once returned a book thirty years late and offered a cake by way of apology. “He died a while back. His nephew brought a couple of boxes. There were books that smelled like barns and books that smelled like classrooms that failed. Had a shed out past Oakey, I think. He used to bring me old magazines and complain about everyone’s punctuation.” She looked past him into the long aisle of failed inheritance and shrugged fondly. “He used to fence, I reckon. Swords. Said he knew a man who did it before there were masks.”

Edwin felt an absurd leap inward like a boy told that the gold coin he had found was in fact unusual. “Did he ever leave an address?”

The woman grimaced at the ceiling as if it had been in charge of this sort of thing. “You’re lucky I remember his nephew’s name,” she said, and pulled out a notebook that had seen more lives than a school janitor. “Greg Willoughby. Plumber. Green Hilux with a tailgate that refuses to admit it is time to stay closed. If I see him, I’ll tell him to drop by. He’s the kind that likes errands. But if you go looking for the house, it’ll be the one with the gate that’s mostly gate but partially fence and a letterbox that looks like a bad joke. On the road out toward the flower farm. He had a daughter once, I think. Or wanted to.”

“Good shopping experience,” Edwin said, meaning it in a way that made her snort. He left his number again on the counter because the world sometimes likes to play this game with you: if three pieces of paper have your number on them, perhaps the fourth will get it in front of the person you need it to.

The weather obligingly did another storm that night but it stayed on the far side of town, as if someone had remembered at the last moment that there was a limit to sport in a residential area. Mr. Clegg’s door remained closed, but a week after the fall a nurse phoned and said, in the cheerful voice used to keep relatives from slamming themselves into the nearest emotion, that he had done well in the surgery and would be home within a fortnight if they could trust the street not to dislodge him. “We can’t trust the street,” Edwin said. “We can trust ourselves.”

On the day Mr. Clegg returned, a taxi that had elected to live forever in a golden age pulled up and a figure got out that was shorter for the difference of a repaired joint. Rel stood on her step and made the rare decision not to cheer. Edwin walked over and asked, in the precise way that doesn’t force any man to declare dependence, whether the bins should be out on Wednesday or whether Mr. Clegg would prefer Thursday to make a point. Mr. Clegg sniffed, which in his case covered compliments, confessions and a minor reworking of treaties. “You would’ve set the bins out crooked,” he observed, permitting history. “I have standards.”

“We’re aware,” Edwin said, and then, very carefully, “Are you…well?”

“I’m upright,” Mr. Clegg replied, and then, astonishingly, “Thank you for interfering.” He looked at the yard like it had borrowed furniture. “Shoddy footwear. Never again. Shoes,” he added, as if confessing to a stable of veiled allies, “are everything.”

They stood in a way that admitted friendship was a craft, the same as woodwork, the same as fencing, requiring measurements and patience. After a minute Mr. Clegg cleared his throat in the octave reserved for amnesty. “You are going to that hall with the sticks on Thursday, aren’t you?”

“I am.”

“You will wear the bin on your head?”

“It is traditional.”

“Good. If you must engage in foreign customs, do them with proper equipment.”

Rel rolled her eyes from her veranda so hard they had to be retrieved from the lawn, and Mr. Clegg’s mouth remembered how to straighten itself into something you could mistake for a smile if you were not handing in an essay on the subject.

In between these small domestic victories and the larger bureaucratic attempts on his time, the name Willoughby did not leave him. He found himself picturing a shed with a workbench like his father’s, a manual like his, and the long disobedient joy of a man practicing a thing he had not been told to put away. On a Sunday that acted like a polite intruder he asked Rel if she felt like an excursion. She wrinkled her nose at the goat-smelling page of her textbook and said that she would if he promised that the place would have the sort of kettle you can boil without counselling it first.

They drove out past the edges where Toowoomba starts to admit that other arrangements of ground exist. The road offered them the usual small theatres—crows that owned fence posts as if elected, a field of sunflowers that had retired from glory and were indulging in the specific melancholy of heads bowed at a certain angle. Past the flower farm there was a gate that was mostly gate and a fence that was partially memory, exactly as advertised; the letterbox had been made at home by someone whose gifts lay elsewhere. The house behind it sat under a tree that had outlived a lot of good intentions and some bad ones. A man in a T-shirt that had once believed in teams emerged from under the bonnet of a car and wiped his hands on the kind of rag that asked to be replaced.

“Greg?” Edwin hazarded, which earned him a measured, not unfriendly squint.

“That depends,” the man said, and then, clocking the book under Edwin’s arm, added, “You’re here about Pop’s nonsense.”

“His sense,” Rel corrected briskly, which in her mouth always sounded like affection’s sharp end. “We live in town. We found his name in a book about swords.”

“She reads feet,” Edwin supplied, entirely unhelpfully, and Greg laughed, which was the kind of noise men make when someone has approached their fence without pretending they’re not real.

They stood under the tree and talked about a man Greg called Pop, who had been someone’s brother, someone’s disappointment and someone’s favourite, depending on the day and participant. He had worked at the dairy co-op before it had reinvented itself and then retired, like a lot of men of his size and generation, into a shed that managed not to burn because it had commanded the weather and the weather had agreed. He had practiced strange things in that shed. He had lived by himself after his wife died and after his daughter decided that distance was a different kind of safety. He had written in pencil because ink was for authorities. He had, on Christmas, brought out a long stick and declared it was a sword and made the nieces and nephews line up and slice at a lemon to prove they could taste something new. He had died in his chair with the radio talking about a horse race, which was, Greg said with a soft authority, the way Pop had intended to go.

“Would you like to see the shed?” Greg asked, and it said something about grief and its second cousins that he was offering this without suspicion. “There’s not much. We cleared it. But there’s…things.”

They went down to a corrugated rectangle that had two more summer’s worth of rust in it than anything else on the property. Inside, the air smelled like timber and dried paint and all the times a man had stood still in order to think. There was a bench, the kind that had not been bought from a flat-pack and hence owed nothing to anyone but time. There were jars of screws labelled not at all or with words like “Little b—ds” in threadbare pencil. On one wall, to Edwin’s shock, there was a photograph tacked up with the kind of pin you have to push hard, a black-and-white shot of a group of men and a couple of women standing in a hall with a caption tiny in the corner that read STARCH FACTORY CO-OP HALL, 1957. Two of them held longswords that had the elasticity of wood. They stood not like actors but like people having taken a break from pretending they didn’t need to be anywhere else. On the back of the photograph, written in the same hand as the book, there was a note: Strong on weak, weak on strong. Not a metaphor. J.W.

Rel had her phone out, because someone had to put the world into an object that could be set down later and picked up without apology. Greg broke the ritual people usually have around old photographs and took it down without asking anyone for permission; he handed it to Edwin, who held it with the respect accorded living treaties. He felt a ridiculous tightening in his chest that was not the bad kind. “He taught himself,” Greg said, as if confessing to a benign crime. “Found a book. Made his own sticks. There was a bloke came up from Brisbane sometimes. Wore shoes too white for the district. They hit each other in the hall until the custodian said his wife had standards. Then they hit each other in the yard.” He grinned suddenly and boyishly. “Sometimes we hid and watched. Pop used to say, ‘Don’t bite on the first soft,’ when Nan would offer him the busted chair and he’d go and get the good one. We thought it was about furniture. I guess it wasn’t.”

Edwin looked at the photograph until his eyes did the thing they did when you have kept them still too long. He put it back with the carefulness of someone returning a borrowed coat. “Would we be able to…?” he began, and then he remembered his manners and unbegan. “If you ever want to…we have a club. A hall that used to be a dairy co-op. A man named Branko who can teach a broom to decide. A girl named Saffron who’s going to rule a small principality comprised entirely of elbows. You’d be welcome to come look. Or swing a stick in the corner and laugh at us.”

Greg shrugged in the way men do when they mean perhaps and are embarrassed by the directness of it. “I might. Pop would have. He liked watching people take a thing seriously. He used to sit at the footy and watch the guys who’d come back from injury and clap at the wrong times because he’d noticed the little ones trying to get the big job done.”

On the way back to town Rel was quiet in the content way, a woman who has placed a piece into a puzzle and is willing to let the rest of the day fail to get any more solved. “You found an ancestor,” she said finally, which in Australia is a dangerous word and a necessary one. “He would have liked you, the old bloke. He had a look about him in that photo like a man who thinks too hard and then chooses anyway.”

“I would like to be liked by that man,” Edwin admitted, which felt like more of a vow than the weather usually allowed. They reached the place where the Range gave its multiple opinions and sat with them for three and a half breaths, the way you do when a bend insists. Back on Margaret Street, the shop bell performed its discretion; he went in and told the tattooed woman that Pop Willoughby’s shed had had within it the smell of promise, and she said, without looking up from a book that had known better readers, “I love it when I’m right about strangers.”

Two days later, at the club, he put the photograph on the plastic table laddered with tape and bruises and watched it be received by the lineage it belonged to. Branko took one look and did the small priest’s face he did when presented with a relic that contained the memory of sweat. “Ah,” he said. “An uncle. We have so many, and none of them agree about anything but honesty.” He taped a copy up on the wall beside a laminated list of rules that had been amended with texta to include the line: Don’t pre-apologize. Underneath it, he wrote in a hand that had its own personality, J.W., and drew a small sword as if a signature required a flourish from the right century.

The season turned more conscientiously. Rel passed tests and forgot to celebrate and then was forced to on a Thursday by Edwin arriving with a cheap bottle of bubbles and an expression that would count as smug only if you did not know the work. They sat on the steps and drank and told each other stories of the kind that will not make sense to any other two people and hence must be believed. Mr. Clegg came out to put his bin away with the air of one who has been released temporarily for good behaviour and asked, in his way, if the game with sticks had made any improvements in standards at the state level. Edwin told him that the referees had improved their flag work. He looked at Rel and saw that she had a shadow under each eye shaped like words she had not yet learned for the purposes of slicing them open later. He felt, with a humility that might only be available at his age, that he would miss her if she had to move, and that this was not something he was going to be able to proof against the future with humour or practice.

In his office one afternoon when the light came in like a favourite student and sat exactly where it had been asked, Annette’s name appeared on his phone again. They spoke about the way their lives had cleverly avoided being either tragedy or farce for periods at a time. She told him she was going to take up swimming in a pool full of other women who would each have the same plan: to move for a while without anyone needing anything from them. He told her about Willoughby and Clegg and a photograph that had contained, against its will, a small piece of permission. “You are learning to put your foot down,” she said, pleased as a sister would be. “I’m glad you waited until you had something worth putting it on.” He said that this was a better line than he had had and she gave it to him because that had always been her way.

By the time Easter decided to bob into view with its quiet insistence on chocolate and church, the beginner class knew how to step without committing treason, Rel had stitched three paws that were only dogs in the sense of optimism, and Mr. Clegg had begun to wave at Saffron when she parked her car across his driveway and then thought better of it. Edwin moved through his days with the added weight of the fact that he was keeping pace with himself; it turned out this was the only weight his knees had agreed to accept without complaint. He found that humility, properly applied, did not make him smaller; it simply changed his centre of gravity. He began to enjoy, in staff meetings, choosing early, if only in the matters of biscuits, and to see what might be possible if he got away with it.

He was standing one afternoon at the back of the hall while a pair of boys argued with sabres in the way sabres force men to confess things about their impatience when Branko drifted over and handed him a sheet of paper with the heavy opinion of official letterhead. “Community day,” Branko said. “Show-and-tell for the Council. They like it when they can pretend they invented us. I want you to talk for five minutes about decisions. You can say the words you say in that lecture theatre but without the whiteboard and with more elbows.”

Edwin, absurdly, felt shy. He also felt the brashness of a man whose neighbour kept walking into the evening and sitting down with generosity in her pockets. “Five minutes,” he said, “and a prop.”

“You can borrow Greg,” Branko said straight-faced. “Or Saff. Or a chair.”

On the day, the hall filled with a truth of the town that had avoided written forms: kids with accidental grass stains, a magistrate exactly disguised as a man in shorts, a woman from Facilities with the kind of sensible shoes that know the weight of a tape dispenser. The Council had brought a ribbon in a box just in case they needed to invent ceremony. Mr. Clegg arrived with a cane he did not need and the determination of someone who would deny attendance if asked later by any committee. Saffron did a demonstration bout with a flourish that will eventually get her into trouble; Tony made a joke about insurance that made the woman from Facilities laugh against her will. Edwin stood up with a practice sword in his hand and said, “I teach statistics, which is a long word for trying to tell the truth without getting into a fight. This is a sword, which is a short word for a way of getting into a fight without lying.” He explained duplieren and absetzen with hands he had not fully understood until they had been asked to take part in his explanations. He talked for four minutes and fifty seconds because profession, and in the last ten seconds he said, “What this has taught me—much as I find this embarrassing—is that often the kindest thing you can do is decide early with the skills you have and then stop yourself when the bell goes. We could live like that quite well.” The applause contained both politeness and another thing, which might have been relief.

After, the woman from Facilities came up and shook his hand with the dry firmness of anyone who has read a subclause and survived. “We will not be moving you on,” she said in a tone that suggested she had, for a glorious minute, considered it. “There are worse sounds than a street with sticks. Also, Mr. Clegg has lodged a letter requesting leniency on the grounds of standards being met. We have framed it.”

“Standards,” Edwin said gravely, and she grinned because her job had a lot of rules and few adjectives and she had enjoyed hearing her own laughter.

Evenings, which had once threatened to be an endless parade of sensible meals and marking, found themselves filling with the small maintenance tasks of being alive properly. He sharpened the plane in his garage and took a sliver off a piece of wood so carefully it looked like an apology curled in sunlight. He oiled the hinge on his front gate and waited with stupid pleasure to hear it close without complaint. He wrote to Willoughby in his head, a letter that had the gall to say thank you as if the dead were the kind who could be bored into replying. He kept the photograph where it could stare at him and offer only the incomprehension of the past, which is to say, the permission to continue.

In late April, when the mornings began to recommend jackets and the magpies took up their positions on the aerials like old ladies at the theatre, Rel knocked on his door and asked, with a bluntness that pretended to be more casual than it was, if he would teach her to hold the practice sword in a way that would not immediately embarrass either of them. “I’m not going to take it up,” she said quickly, as if God were listening and had rules. “I just want to know how to stand so I stop looking like a person about to be given a present she doesn’t deserve.”

He put a synthetic blade in her hands and watched the transformation that happens to everyone: the first jump to a movie, the second to a child’s memory, and then the third to the present one has asked to hold. He showed her vom Tag, which she described as the posture of a woman who had remembered where she put the hammer. He showed her the line and the simple step that refuses to be fooled by the angle of a shadow. She was attentive the way students are when they’ve already failed at something harder and are treating this with the respect of a holiday. Biscuit lay at the side panting smiles. “Elbows,” Rel muttered, betraying a memory she had insisted she did not have. “Traitors.”

“Always,” he agreed. “Our job is to keep an eye on them without making them self-conscious.”

They practised until light told them it had other engagements. They stood on the veranda then, not quite close and not purposefully apart, and admired the trivial miracles a day can produce if asked nicely. “You’ll do this until you can’t,” she said, not question, not prophecy, and he said that he thought so, because he had decided that there was no shame in stating an intention that might one day be interrupted by events weathered by all living things. “And if you can’t,” she added, “you’ll find a way to keep deciding. The muscles adapt. That’s what they do if we feed them enough stupid protein and kindness.”

“I’m getting very good at stupid,” he said, and she reached across and flicked his ear, just once, like an aunt or a conspirator. There was a satellite overhead, a proper one, and they both took a moment to count it as if it were a friendly train. Mr. Clegg’s window was lit by a lamp that had lost an argument with a shade but was continuing the marriage for propriety. Somewhere someone practised the piano with the intensity of hatred; someone else practised forgiving them. He put the practice sword away because objects like to know their place when it is time to sleep, and for the first time in a life he had not always admitted to wanting, he felt like a person who, if called upon, could lay his hands on the right thing in the dark.The mornings took on the faint metallic edge of a wet saw. He liked the way the cold made steam bloom out of his mug, as if the cup were thinking too quickly for its own good. He liked too the way the street changed register, cars moving with their lights like quiet assertions, breath rendered briefly visible so that everyone was made honest by their own lungs. The jacaranda, stubborn about its memorabilia, clung to a few crisp trumpets like compliments nobody had found the right vase for. On those days when his hands did the basic work on the veranda—the long lift, the diagonal step, the moment his wrists told him not to do the glorious thing—his knee began to submit comments in the mild, argumentative tone of a bureaucrat who has discovered poetry. He talked back to it gently and took to walking more purposefully between rooms, convincing his body that shouldering a day was not a shock. He did his footwork with the beginners and introduced them to the concept of changing weight without asking permission, and he watched their expressions accept the notion with the exact amount of resentment that foretold future competence.

In the office the email arrived with a subject line that tried too hard to be cheerful. The regional mathematics education conference wanted a keynote from him—fifteen minutes and then questions for people who have opinions and carbs. They wanted something about helping non-mathematicians not hate numbers before they had even introduced themselves. He opened the attachment because it is a professional habit to flatter requests with PDF. The phrase “embodied understanding” had been typed by someone who thought very highly of hyphens. He leaned back and saw, in the reflection of his window, a sixty-one-year-old man who had become ridiculous enough to combine swords and statistics in public and had not yet been put out of any rooms. He wrote back Yes, because the older version of himself had spent too long drafting polite declines to good things, and because Lorna, if he told her, would pass him in the corridor and say, “If you have something to say and you don’t say it, we’ll all have to put up with you saying it to us instead.”

Rel’s messages began to look like the inside of a racing mind. Pictures of hooves, a video of a calf standing with the determination of a person who has decided to live before getting the manual, long sentences that ran until they tripped on themselves and got back up. One Friday she came in when she usually went out, dropped her bag in a way that gave the floor new respect, and sat on his step without the theatre of saying hello. Biscuit climbed onto her lap as if ordered by a superior. He came out with two mugs and the teapot that had never learned it wasn’t a public servant and sat down one step below her because the day had arranged the seating and he had no wish to renegotiate.

“I had to do my first—” she began, and then looked at the dog because dogs, when you have to use certain words in the world, are repositories for grief that doesn’t fit anywhere else. “We had to put down a horse. Sweet old bay I met last week who tried to eat my hair in the way of the hungry and affectionate. Complications. It wasn’t dramatic. Except in the exactly right way that this sort of thing always is.”

He did not tell her anything wise. He poured tea and held his mug the way you hold someone’s coat while they do something hard—steady and close by and without comment. She talked in a tone that made the weather listen. The vet had spoken in the voice professionals save for moments when nobody wants to be persuaded and everyone needs to be accompanied. The family had stood in that circle humans can still make without practice. The old horse had breathed the way animals do when freed from being in charge of anything. Rel’s hands, which he knew mostly paired with exuberance and rope, had been the exact weight they needed to be, which was all the comfort she had to take away from the day.

“I can tell when I’ve done a good one,” she said at last, with the exhausted pride of a mechanic who has put back together a car a man thought was a dog. “Not because anyone says so. Because the room stops inventing history. It’s like…the music returns to the original key. I just used the word music like I might be the kind of person who writes essays about moss.”

“You say the weirdest true things,” he told her, and she smiled at the dog’s ear instead of at him, because it is sometimes easier to accept consolation from a creature who will forget whatever you owe it by morning.

At work he did a rash thing and then wrote a policy for it. In his first-year lecture he told them they would, this week, receive marks for being wrong early. He put up a problem whose answer had the good grace to be counterintuitive and gave them two minutes to commit themselves to a direction without calculators, phones or consultation. He told them that the act of putting a stake down before the crowd formed around a more fashionable spot was the muscle he wanted. He told them they would get feedback and a point for bravery and that if they changed their minds later he would not punish them for the survival instinct. He watched reluctance become mischief and mischief become a kind of relief. Afterward he sent his head of school an email that did not ask permission and did explain out loud that he would, if invited, measure the effect of this foolishness in a way that would satisfy both gods. The reply came back after a decent pause. It included two commas of suspicion and the phrase “pilot expansion,” which in his mouth tasted like a cake he could make more of.

Greg turned up at the hall one Thursday with a long wooden thing wrapped in a towel. He had the careful step of a man who distrusted floors that had seen too much weather. He unwrapped the thing on the table with a gentleness that would have done for babies or explosives. It was a waster Pop Willoughby had cut from something that had once been part of a verandah, by the look of it. The edges were rounded like manners; the handle had been wrapped in what had initially been a belt and then had been a good idea. There was a notch in one side that suggested an argument with a nail and the kind of scar that houses carry. Greg held it out in both hands and looked at Branko as if handing over a family member to a school he could trust.

Branko took it without pretending any of this was an accident. He weighed it in his palms and smiled with the small corners of his mouth because he was too proud to do a full grin in public. “There are shapes in this,” he said. “Someone has been talking to himself for years in here.” He set it on the wall under the photograph Edwin had printed and laminated with the club’s budget’s disapproving consent. They made a little place for it with tape and a laminated sign that read PLEASE DO NOT SWAT FRIENDS WITH THIS, which Tony amended with a small drawing of a flame. Greg stood for a while at the edge of the drills watching bodies do their specific prayers. Saffron, being Saffron, handed him a mask and told him it was better looking on than off and that he shouldn’t get used to that kind of privilege in general. He smiled the awkward smile of the newly invited and then slipped away early because the way home from being welcomed is always better taken in the long light.

The interclub friendly that Branko had announced like a birthday party for functional adults arrived with a stack of disclaimer forms and the exact number of enthusiastic people who made you worry slightly about the building’s insurance. Clubs from Ipswich and the Gold Coast turned up with banners that had maybe met a cake stall before. The hall smelled like a surf shop that had borrowed someone’s lawn. Edwin taped his knee without ceremony and told himself he would step when stepping was wise and admire the young when stepping tried to flatter him into stupidity. He suited up, warmed up, and then felt the knee give him a sentence he didn’t want to read to the end. Nothing loud. Nothing that required a declaration. A difference at the hinge, like a book that has been leaned on too often. He sat down before anyone told him to and took his shoe off to give pain an exit it would not take. Saffron sat next to him as if ordered and said, without pretending this wasn’t a loss, “You can judge me so hard I’ll improve out of spite.”

He did flags until he could hear the bell when it wasn’t there. He called points out loud and discovered his voice had two settings: patient dad and rude magistrate. He had to recall his own lecture to stop himself from apologizing to boys younger than his old shower tiles. Between bouts he tightened laces and told other people to drink water. He found that the thrill he expected to miss was low in his throat but the satisfaction he had not ordered settled exactly where his breath lived. Branko came by and nodded at his leg like a foreman inspecting a beam and said, “Good stop,” as if he had done an advanced technique on purpose. Mr. Clegg appeared at the doorway, cane in hand, standing like a flagpole that had chosen to grow there of its own accord. He watched three exchanges and then said, with all the generosity his chin could muster, “Not embarrassing,” which carried, secretly, each of the four parts of a compliment: observation, approval, standards applied, standards sustained.

In the evenings the study table shifted from his kitchen to Rel’s and back again as if participating in a sensible shared custody arrangement. He learned the names of bones in horses’ legs that sounded like legal instruments. She learned more about confidence intervals than any vet student had a right to and badgered him mercilessly until he admitted he had been describing them badly for at least a decade. It took only one night for the sofa to declare whose sleep it would be hosting; he put a blanket over her and turned off the lamp and stepped over Biscuit with the care of a man negotiating with a democracy. When she woke at two and said, from under the cloud of hair pushed over her face, “Did I drool?” he told her that the city had survived, and she went back under with the trust of those who have done enough work to earn this much absence.

Annette sent a text with the breezy tact she reserved for occasions where care wanted to try on casual. She would be in town for a weekend to visit a school friend and did he want to brave a coffee that would change nothing and also might change something minor and important, like what you call the colour of your kitchen. They met on Ruthven Street at a cafe that had opinions about avocado. She had the same laugh and different hair and a way of looking over the top of her mug that had once made him agree to buy a house sight unseen. They talked like people who had kept their worst arguments in a drawer and left them there by mutual if belated consent. She asked him, with the laundry list manner of someone who had no right to know and who also did, about the swordfighting and his knee and the neighbour with the freeze on his eyebrows. He told her a version of Willoughby that made her actually take her glasses off to check he was not making it up. He did not bring up Rel and yet there she was anyway at the end of the hour, because people travel in pairs across the mind now that he had allowed that. When they walked out into the mild wind and she put a hand on his forearm and said, “I am glad, Ed,” he believed her and did not go home to make a ranked list of the other things she might also be.

A letter of the kind that had previously come to him to scold arrived one afternoon in a polite cream envelope with Councillor’s Office in the corner in a font chosen by a committee. It invited him to be on a working group about “activating underused community spaces for intergenerational skill sharing,” which translated into rooms full of people holding teacups while explaining their useful enthusiasms. He sat at his table with the manual and the photograph and the candle jar that said cinnamon was a way of life and measured whether he had the stamina to show up to a different bureaucracy and decide to be himself there too. He thought about Willoughby’s shed and about Greg’s unwilling tenderness and about the way Mr. Clegg had said the word standards and meant something too big for that cupboard. He wrote back Yes and added the sentence, “I will bring a picture,” because that seemed relevant.

The bush put on smoke like a coat that did not belong to it. It wasn’t close—the kind of weather that turns sky into statements happened kilometres away—but the town wore the haze the way a man wears tiredness he pretends is choice. Rel rang in late afternoon with a voice that was already taking off its shoes at the end of a run. A small property out near Wellcamp had called in a favour because they needed hands to move crates and hands were scarce and she had appropriately foolish neighbours. He put the sword away because there are days when you do not bring your hobby to a room with work in it and grabbed his boots and a roll of tape because he knew by now that nothing happens without tape.

The place had a fence that had not yet made up its mind and a shed that wanted to be a conversation. Chickens were having a meeting about standards; two goats were staging an insurrection and then reconsidering the long-term consequences of governance; an old dog looked at him and passed the burden of vigilance over for a minute. He moved cages, he lifted things that were uncooperative, he learned which of the little wire doors insisted on having their best side presented to them before they would latch. He learned that his knee could be convinced by a steady pace and decent shoes. He watched Rel carry a cranky cat as if it were a violated treaty and admired the way she kept no record of her own kindness except the immediate requirement to do it again. On the drive back they took it slow because you do when you have loaded somebody’s life into boxes and strapped them down, and in a pocket of quiet between paddocks she said, “Thank you,” as if he had not been waiting all afternoon to earn that exact syllable.

Mr. Clegg took to doing his rehabilitation laps along the footpath with a ruler in his hand. He explained, when asked, that the ruler helped his brain remember the exact job his foot had been assigned, and also that he was not above checking the neighbours’ hedges for compliance with council guidelines. He stopped one evening at their steps and asked Rel, with the air of a man deciding to share a biscuit with a dog, if she’d like the name of a woman at the hospital who did good work with hips and did not treat a man as if he were a piece of furniture. He looked at Edwin with the suspicion of a man who had watched another man become a different kind of citizen and was willing to be made slightly uncomfortable by it. He looked, too, at the photograph on Edwin’s table as if it had committed a minor offense and resolved to forgive it. Later, with his blinds unable to take it anymore and sneaking a look at the sunset like children told to finish their homework, he told Edwin the woman in the picture on his mantel had indeed been his wife, and then did the strangest thing—a thing that altered the air between them with its specific gravity—and said her name. He said, “Mairi,” and the syllables did a round of the room and sat down where they needed to.

The conference day arrived with a lectern that had known speeches with fewer metaphors. He stood and asked a room for five indulgences: that they allow themselves to be wrong in public, that they agree to decide early and revisit that decision kindly, that they consider that numbers are shy and do better when approached sideways, that they stop apologizing for the part of their brain that panics and instead give it a small job, and that they imagine their hands could be useful to their heads in ways the heads had not previously sanctioned. He told them about the bind without naming it and watched Lorna, in the third row, smile at him with the ferocity of a person who had spent a lifetime watching men climb out on limbs and had learned to relax only when someone had measured the thickness of the branch. Afterwards a young teacher whose hands flapped like birds being told to stay on the branch came up and said she wanted to tell her year nines that bravery in their classroom was a mark they would wear into other rooms. He told her to write it on the board in block letters and to make it the only thing that stayed up all term and to buy herself a decent whiteboard marker in the colours children like to lie to and then relent.

His knee behaved, then sulked. He wrapped it again and noticed he had begun to live with a new internal calculus: how to spend himself. There were days he set the sword aside because the decision to step into a bind was not compatible with the decision to carry a crate later. There were other days he took a point off a man who had not bought electrolytes because he had decided to drink water instead of opinions. He came home those nights and sat on the step opposite Rel and added to the ledger of their days without needing anything to be repaid. When she fell asleep at his kitchen table and woke to find her notes rearranged into a stack at the precise angle of his attention to order, she said “You meddled,” and he said, “I tidied,” and they performed the tiny theatre of their mutual contempt for chaos until Biscuit put a paw on each thigh and declared a truce.

Greg turned up on a Monday with a girl who might have been cousin or friend or a new person he was practicing being proud of. She had the stance of an eleven-year-old who had already been told twice that she ran like a boy and was busy deciding whether to take this as a note on speed or on grace. She looked at the photograph of Pop Willoughby and said, “He looks like the man on the ten-dollar note but less sneaky,” and Greg laughed and said, “She’s the only one I brought who’ll say any true thing about anyone.” Edwin put a plastic sword in her hand and watched her not be silly. He found himself nearly ridiculous with longing to be the sort of person whose presence would be written about on the back of a photograph in a shed nobody had yet been born to care for.

It sat with him, that longing, without spoiling anything. It did not demand outcome; it insisted only on process. He bought a new notebook that did not mock him for buying it and wrote names in it—Lorna and Branko and Saffron and Tony and Rel and Biscuit and Mr. Clegg and Willoughby and Annette—and a line under each like a shelf he meant to keep dust off. He wrote a list of decisions he was proud of, which looked like a child’s version of bravery but was in fact the adult one: stopping when his knee suggested it; letting the beginner class see him fail at a drill and not pretend it was on purpose; saying the word neighbour to a man who liked streets to be agreements made without words. He taped a strip of paper under the photograph on the kitchen wall with the phrase Don’t bite on the first soft and the date, because maybe the trick to being a person who could find the right thing in the dark was to remind himself, in the light, that softness can be an invitation to stay where you are not meant to.

It was on one of the cold mornings when the light found new things to do with the gum tree that Rel turned up with her scrubs tied around her waist and a jacket that had known other people’s weather. She did a little spin on the step like a girl who had stolen an hour. She had, tucked under her arm, a thin folder labelled with a printed sticker that declared, without poetry but with pronounced pride, Student Placement Schedule. She had been allocated, for a week, to a clinic up on the Range road, the kind with a view of paddocks and a waiting room where people learn their turn is dependent on other creatures’ decisions. She told him like a kid tells a parent about a playground that might have been made just for their shoes. He listened like a man who had received, at last, the right docket for the wrong debt. He poured tea; she took off her jacket and revealed a T-shirt that read HOOF AND MOUTH AND HEART, effacing the disease with sentiment. Biscuit sat gloriously because the world, for a minute, had decided to stand up straighter.

“Come watch?” she asked, as if they were inviting the whole street and apologising in advance. “Not in the room. In the car park. I’ll come out and tell you when I’ve done anything that makes me more of a person.”

He would have sat in a car park for her for any number of hours and did not say that now was not the time for telling anybody how new that recognition felt. He said he would bring coffee that did not taste like anyone’s regret and perhaps a small cheerful food and a book he would not read. She reached across and tugged his sleeve with two fingers, the minimal gesture of someone acknowledging a debt they refuse to dignify with ceremony. He watched her walk back along the veranda and thought, not for the first time and not for the last, that the manual had never been about fighting, exactly. It had been about the etiquette of presence. You stand, you pay attention, you choose, you stop when the bell goes, you acknowledge, you go home, you share bread. You are wounded sometimes. You will be tended, if you have chosen the right street.

The day at the clinic car park passed in increments. He made a little encampment out of his car and a newspaper and a thermos and a pie he had found in a bakery that confessed to its sins with sugar. He watched people carry animals as if animals were the pieces you take out of a house first in a flood. He thought of Willoughby’s shed and its jars and its rememberings and had the abrupt, unfashionable desire to build himself a bench worthy of making nothing on. When Rel appeared mid-morning with a smear of something that had once been inside a cow on her sleeve and an expression that had more sun under it than the day admitted, he stood in a way that permitted her to sit immediately. She ate the pie with the voracity of a person whose somatic nervous system had been busy negotiating with many other systems. She told him about a calf’s first breath that had come stubbornly and then triumphantly and about a man who had held his hat in both hands through the entire appointment as if he were in church. She returned to the building like a person walking into a storm they had made a deal with.

He stayed. He thought about the bind again, in its clean sense and in the larger one. The point where you become attached to other people’s momentum for a minute and find that your options multiply if you attend to them. He thought about his left hand, honest and unglorious and necessary. He thought, because he was receiving an education despite himself, about stopping as an act of fidelity instead of surrender. He thought, briefly and almost tenderly, about his knee and its advisory committee.

When he got home the wind had brought down a branch off the gum. It lay across both their lawns like an argument that had been interrupted by the bell. He fetched the saw from his garage—the old one that still wanted oil and companionship—and he and Rel cut it down to the size that could be persuaded into green waste. They made small jokes because two people cutting a limb off a tree in front of other people’s houses cannot carry on their private tragedies without startling the postman. Mr. Clegg came out with his ruler and declared the angle of their cuts satisfactory. Biscuit kept a respectful distance after one sharp bark at the whole concept of gravity. They dragged, they swept, they put things in bins, they leaned on the fence with knees reporting details, and when they were done they did the thing human beings have always done on resolving the small seige of a common object and said, in almost unison, “Tea?”

He took his cup inside after and stood at his kitchen table with the book and the photograph and the candle and the ruler Mairi had once insisted be kept near the phone under the theory that both would be needed in emergencies. He put his hands on the table the way men do when they are choosing whether to give someone their time. He had begun the chapter of his life where you could count the big beginnings without running out of breath. He believed, perhaps immodestly, that he could still be someone’s useful uncle in a room that smelled of old varnish and new ideas. He believed, cautiously, that he might yet be the sort of man who, if you wrote his name on the back of a photograph because there was no other way to carry him forward, would be worth the pencil. He believed, at last, that he had enough to put down on a shelf and that, if asked, he could get his hands on it without turning on the light.The council building had been designed by someone who believed glass could behave itself if given a stern talking-to. It held the afternoon light like an argument it wanted to win later. Edwin walked into the room set aside for the working group and found the usual assortment of folding chairs and people with municipal haircuts, plus a trestle table with water jugs that seemed to have survived several regimes. On the wall, someone had blu-tacked photos of the city’s underused spaces: scout halls whose roofs remembered the bingo nights of another century, a defunct bowlo where the green had become an existential question, a room above a bakery with a fire exit that was clearly a suggestion. He nodded at the councillor he’d met on community day and at a woman in a cardigan that outfoxed fashion with confidence; he sat with Lorna, who had come out of sheer predatory interest, and with a retired panel beater named Roy who introduced himself by way of apologising for sixty years of honest labour.

“We’re not a committee,” the councillor said in the voice of a person who had declared such things before. “We’re a working group. We are here to activate spaces with intergenerational skills, which is to say, we are here to take the magic out of young people’s thumbs and put it into their elbows.”

“Elbows are traitors,” Saffron murmured from the back, having somehow infiltrated local government without a pass, and the room did the small laugh of people discovering the right scale for their mirth.

They went around naming the crafts they could bring. A woman named Dot offered crochet and hard truths. Roy would teach anyone who cared to listen how to knock a dent out of a door without making the story worse. A jazz teacher, currently unemployed by budget, said he could corral a school band into coherence and out again in three weeks. Edwin said he could make statistics stop behaving like a ghost and, more relevantly, that he could teach the decision-making that lives under the sword stuff without any blade being introduced to any wrist. The councillor nodded, pleased to put a tick next to a box that had not existed when the agenda was printed.

They were making an inventory of spaces with working kettles when the fire alarm went. Not the room’s fire alarm, which had the self-importance of a child chosen as line leader, but phones all together, buzzing like a hive the second a leaf falls. Smoke advisory; grassfire out near Westbrook with a wind inclined to gossip. People lifted their screens and read aloud the familiar phrases—watch and act, prepare to leave—like a litany in a church that had accepted its congregants would come only when pressed. The councillor’s phone rang with a tone selected by a teenager; she said the word hall twice and then said yes in the voice that is the difference between ceremonial government and useful government.

“We’re opening Starch Factory,” she said, already on her feet. “Cooling, water, radios. People can bring animals if they arrive in a temperament approved for committee work. Who can—”

“Keys,” Roy said, patting his pockets like a magician who has misplaced his rabbit. “I’ve still got them from the time we moved the shelves. It’s only government if you give them back.”

“I’ll text Branko,” Edwin said, bewildered but moving, because there are days when the plan is simply to be present. “He’s got bodies, and bodies are always step one.”

They dispersed with the relative elegance of a flock of bright birds disturbed. On the street, the light had altered itself into the yellow of an old memory; the edge of it stung the throat with the honesty of eucalyptus. Edwin drove across town with his hands remembering the positions for steadiness and his knees sending their opinions up like minutes of a meeting. He rang Rel because that was what being sensible sometimes meant, and she answered out of a windscreen with a wail of sirens moving away and Biscuit’s complaint of being left behind carried in the car with another neighbour.

“I’m headed to Wellcamp,” she said, breathless and brisk—the other voice she had, the one that belonged to triage and field calls and the particular terror of goats. “One of the properties from last week. We’re moving stock and telling men with opinions that they are not immune to physics. If you open that hall, make a tea station and a hose station and a place people can sit without being told a story about themselves. I’ll copy you when I can. Don’t stand in the wrong smoke. It remembers.”

“Left hand honest,” he said stupidly, and she made the laugh you make to someone whose limited poetry you have decided to keep anyway.

The Starch Factory Cooperative Hall felt different with the doors open wide in the middle of the day. It had always been a room that wanted use; it did not care for prettiness. Branko arrived at a pace that made you forgive him any offence against the Road Rules of his youth; Saffron came behind with a box labelled MEDICAL that turned out to be tape, biscuits and the kind of bandages that look like promises. Tony backed up with a cart that had belonged to a grocery store in 1983 and declared, eyes watering in an entirely masculine reaction to smoke, that he could work the urn without recourse to instruction or shame. Roy opened cupboards that still smelled, faintly, of milk powder and decided which benches were honest enough to be trusted.

They became a throat for the town. People came in carrying animals in blankets and on leashes and in crates that squeaked. A woman arrived with a cockatoo who swore at fire in a manner that suggested prior acquaintance. A teenager carried a guinea pig with the concentrated dignity of a surgeon. Someone’s kid had put a goldfish in a takeaway container and brought it across town as if it were the Queen. The radio on the table hissed and crackled and said grown-up sentences about edges and spot fires and containment lines while out the door the smoke did its implacable theatre.

“Stations!” Branko declared, which is what he does when the world requires order. “Water for humans here, water for animals there, masks if you’ve got them, wet cloths for anyone who thinks they’re being brave and is actually being stupid. Saff, triage the pets. Tony, door. Edwin—”

“Decisions,” Edwin said, more determined than qualified. “I can do the talking that stops people walking into the wrong room.” He stepped to the entrance and made himself look like a landmark. He greeted people by their first obvious truth and then their name when it revealed itself. He was sunnier than he felt because sunshine has its uses when the air turns brown. He put old men in chairs and old ladies behind tables because both needed roles. He made a sign with a marker in block letters that said DRINK, and another that said SIT, and a third that said YOUR BACK IS ALLOWED TO TOUCH A CHAIR.

Mr. Clegg appeared at the doorway in the manner of a man checking the execution of public policy. He wore a cap that had been kept too carefully to be dignified by the term baseball. He looked at the room with the compressed gaze of a barrister faced with a messy precedent. “Standards,” he began, and then performed the rare trick of revising his footnote mid-sentence. “Do you require paper cups or a different sort of cup?”

“Paper,” Edwin said, relieved because there was no way of managing a porcelain breakage conversation with this man and also because paper cups are the only cups that know their job on days like this. “And people to tell other people they can sit down. And hands that can put a hose somewhere sensible.”

“I am the standards committee with wet cloths,” Mr. Clegg declared, and went to the tub like a retired general at his last battle. Within minutes he had built a station that made sense: cloths in clean, cloths in use, cloths retired from duty, water changed when required, an instructional sign with letters so tidy you could have stacked them. He told three people to put their shoulders down and they did. He let one man, who was in the advanced stages of being nobody’s boss for the first time all week, fold a stack of towels, and he did it as if folding were a personal testimony.

Saffron took in a spaniel who had decided that smoke was a personal affront and said ridiculous things to its ears until it agreed to be soothed. Roy found a way to wedge open the back door with a crate so that the air behaved more like air. The cockatoo offered a suggestion about the weather that made Tony laugh for the first time since the sirens. A woman in a shirt that said I’M FINE, THANKS cried next to the electric urn in the way of people who try and fail to have a conversation with composure; Edwin handed her a cup of tea with the attentiveness you’d give a relic, not because he is religious but because tea, on this continent, is step one and that is the end of the argument. He put himself in the path of panic and let it hit him. He let Rel’s voice in his head—be precise, be gentle—sit next to Branko’s—make a plan which includes stopping—and between the two of them he found that his left hand knew what to do with a pen and a list when handed both.

Smoke pressed the edges of the afternoon in and then, like a tide misremembering itself, began to retract. People checked phones and made noises, the strange little vocalizations that belong to good news when you’ve been expecting a different thing. The radio said the words “defensive lines” with approval. Dogs put their heads down and put their worries on the floor like stones they had been carrying in their teeth for too long. There was a lull, the kind that tastes like exhaustion and sugar. Branko sat on a chair finally as if he’d been given permission by a superior. Saffron looked like a woman auditioning for a role in a film about fatigue and still had joke reserves, which was the unnerving thing about her. Tony arranged the cups by size and age in a way that would have made no sense to a god but happened to be perfect for the humans in attendance.

Rel arrived covered in grass and decision. Her eyes had the bright, ill-advised honesty of adrenaline. She came in the way a person comes in when they have run out of outside. He knew not to ask her any of the wrong questions. She found him at his table covered in notes and cups and hand sanitizer pretending to be the answer to modernity and put her forehead briefly to his shoulder not because they were a kind in public but because muscles sometimes require an address. “We held the line,” she said when she had breath and a mug. “They’ll go back in with a cart tomorrow to count what’s still saying yes to being alive. I have discovered I can load a trailer with a semi-reasonable composition under pressure. Also, a woman handed me her wedding album because the TV told her what to take and it turns out the TV wasn’t wrong. She had the presence of mind to put the kettle in too.”

“Standards,” Mr. Clegg murmured into a towel, without malice for once in his life, and Rel leaned over and kissed the air near his cheek in the kind of affectionate mockery people grant their saints.

By evening the hall had become a different thing, and this felt appropriate, because rooms, like people, must have multiple biographies. People drifted back out in pairs, in twos and ones and small clumps that had the movement of jellyfish regaining their shape after a wave. The cockatoo said something romantic and obscene to the dusk and was adored for it. The goldfish had survived with the bland invincibility of the young. The woman with the wedding album wiped her eyes at the door and said, to no one in particular and to everyone, that this was why halls must be preserved even when budgets pretend they don’t exist. The councillor, who had returned with a square of slice that appeared to have been baked by local government regulations, said she had taken a photograph of the wet cloth station for the Council Facebook, and Mr. Clegg said she could do as she liked if she wished to be associated with robust process.

They stacked chairs with the tired exactness of people at the end of a working bee and found that the end of a day had snuck up on them with its automatic lights. Edwin took the sign that said SIT and folded it into a square, because it had done its job better than anything he’d written in a semester. He found Rel sitting on the edge of the stage with her heels braced, hanging on her own ankles and giving them instructions to remain uprights. He sat beside her because this kind of symmetry still felt like a gift he did not have to declare on any forms. They looked at the room together. The air carried the memory of a hundred distinct anxieties and the reliefs assigned to them.

“We did a decent job,” she said, hands around her mug as if warming her opinion on it. “We did a small job in the big job. We made a room behave. That’s sometimes all anyone can ask for.”

“I said the word neighbour to a stranger without needing a dissertation,” he admitted, gaze on the floor which after a day like this had become an object he believed in. “It felt like a verb. I keep thinking how much of the manual is about stopping once the bell has rung and how much of life has missed that memo.”

“You did the thing,” she said simply, and he thought he would have sat through a thousand community meetings for that sentence. “Also, Mr. Clegg is going to be unbearable with this new line of public service to his name. Prepare yourself for opinions on soakage trenches.”

That night, when the sky returned to its usual indifference and the smoke drifted away to taste other districts, he lay in bed with his knee reminding him of every step and his hands smelling faintly of towels and eucalyptus. His phone pinged in the good way and showed a message from the councillor with a photograph of the hall in its full emergency bloom and a line that said: Thank you. We will pay for the cups and the water. We cannot pay for the minute you stopped a man from going back to get his stereo. He laughed once more, soft, at the organised tyranny of radios and the benevolence of cups. He slept like a man whose cells had had a day they could respect.

The next week he went back to the hall at the appointed hour for the intergenerational afternoon that had been planned before the fire and might have been postponed if anyone had been in the mood to be reasonable. They weren’t. They were in the mood to use the hall while it remembered them and they remembered it. Roy had brought a door and let teenagers thump it with a rubber mallet for ten minutes before showing them how you actually persuaded a dent to recant. Dot taught a boy with tragic bangs to crochet a square that might hold a hot pan if the pan asked politely. A man with a trumpet collected five children with longing in their faces and got them to breathe into a thing until it made a complaint and then a note; he told their mothers not to worry that the first half of music lesson is always swearwords, even if you do it right.

Edwin put out a sign that said Quiet Courage and then realized what he had done and pretended it was someone else’s fault. He ran a little station where people stood with plastic swords and decided without hurting themselves. He showed left-hand truth to teenagers who had not been told their left hand was capable of anything except writing on their jeans, and he watched their faces stall on the way to a grin. He talked to an old man named Bill who had once been the second-best shearer in a shed that no longer stands and who now wanted to know whether he should be ashamed of his conversion to woodworking. He was not. He showed a girl how to stand so that boxes would know when she meant business and a woman how to stand so that an argument would not arrive at a higher volume simply because it wanted to. He found that teaching at a trestle table with a rope dividing everybody’s ambitions was exactly his idea of civilisation.

“Pop would have liked this,” Greg said, appearing with his niece in tow, both of them looking ironical to avoid becoming sentimental. “He wouldn’t have brought his belt sword. He would have brought his chair. That says a lot about a person.”

“It does,” Edwin said, thinking of Willoughby’s photograph now laminated and given a home on the noticeboard with two pins that had to be shoved in with purpose. “It says they expected to stay.”

The knee decided to have an opinion the following Thursday that insisted on being taken seriously. Edwin warmed up, did a set of footwork with the beginners, talked them through the idea that balance is interesting even when it is boring, and then when the group moved to coached bouts he sat down without argument. He had learned enough to see the difference between courage and a lack of imagination. Saffron flopped beside him in the break in the way of someone determined to make a large statement with her spinal column and what she expected of furniture.

“Hard stop?” she asked, inspecting his knee with the regard usually reserved for stale scones and men who arrive at the club with the wrong shoes.

“I am admitting to being a person who puts away the fun early enough to keep having it,” he said, almost prim, and found that saying it out loud let the room stop measuring him by any other scale he did not care for. “I can judge. I can be a useful flag.”

“You can shout with dignity,” she agreed, very seriously. “That’s most of life.”

He stood at the corner and raised and lowered flags until the movements became that odd sort of muscle memory that doesn’t belong to limbs so much as to a temperament. He called clean points clean and messy ones messy, and he found that when he took the mask off people did not hate him for being the person interrupting their story. In the car on the way home he realized that occupying the corner had enlarged the world; it had not made him smaller. He told the thought to behave and it did.

Annette, in town and brave enough to be the past in the same suburb as the present, asked if she could meet the dog who had taken over so many paragraphs of his messages. He invited her to the steps because that was the only venue that made sense anymore and because Rel was the sort of person who could be given a first name and a context and then be trusted not to either perform or hide in the bush. They arranged a time and he arranged his kitchen and then, without trying very hard, put on a shirt that was less about holes and more about apologising for nothing. Annette arrived holding a plant that had the discouraging beauty of a gift you must now keep alive. Biscuit performed her welcome in the shape of a parabola; Rel waved with a hand that had both competence and bandage tape stuck to the wrist like confetti.

They sat and did the civilized work of making a room out of a step. Annette liked the dog and the rosemary and the parade of small neighbourhood events Rel could summarize without naming names. Rel liked the way Annette cornered a sentence and made it admit to snobbery; Annette liked the way Rel offered a story and then refused it a second act, letting it live with a single good ending. The sun did its very best not to make anyone sentimental, and failed. Mr. Clegg came out and stared at them and then, astonishingly, said hello to Annette like a man who was prepared to include the past in his idea of standards. Some long jammed gear slipped a tooth forward, and nobody said anything about it.

After Annette left, Rel flicked Edwin’s arm with two fingers again, a tiny ceremony of her own, and said, “Your life used to be tidy but hungry. It’s untidy now. You’re eating properly.”

He wanted to say that he had, all these years, been preparing cutlery and that now, finally, the food had arrived. He did not say this because he had begun to learn that even jokes have a serving size. He said instead that he liked the way the hall looked at night when no one was in it, and she told him to stop being seductive to municipal buildings and to go inside to his email which had started to walk itself.

The keynote came and went like a polite storm. He wore a jacket that had gone nice from being folded on too many office chairs. He told the room that numbers could be shy and that you could do them the courtesy of an approach that did not involve shouting. He told them about deciding early and about the bind without saying the word sword because he had kept his promise to himself—no swords before week three—and because he had learned that metaphors behaved better when they wore plain clothes. He fielded questions from a man who had never once forgiven his year nine teacher and from a woman who asked her questions as if she had baked them at dawn. He did not step into any trap he saw and ignored elegantly the ones he did not. He went home after and opened a beer he had hidden from himself and let it look at him until he was ready for it.

It was the start of winter that took a part of him by surprise, the way the cold tells you it is time to draw your life in a little without insisting on it. He found an old scarf and wore it in a way that probably made him look like someone who used to be in a band; he found that he enjoyed his kitchen more at dusk because the colours changed their minds in slow increments. He finally built the bench he’d threatened to build, cutting timber at a pace that would have made his father impatient and himself patient; he oiled it and did not, as a younger version would have, apologise to it for not being useful immediately. He set the manual and the photograph and Willoughby’s phrase down on it one by one as if they were tools that had been handed to him by someone he’d learned to respect.

One evening he took the practice sword next door because Rel had insisted she be able to do more than hold in a way that fooled no one, and because he had come to want the sound of her laugh when she discovered an angle with her body that matched something in her head. He showed her the simple bind without heat, just the way two lines can kiss and then argue and then part. She called it a chitchat, then a quorum, then finally, satisfied at finding a word that made everyone in her mind behave, a compromise with no lying. She took the point up the line and then, with that small shocking competitiveness that belongs to people who have trained to be kind and then discover they can be more than one thing, she did it again faster. He put a hand up without thinking when the tip kept going and she stopped it with the precision of someone unused to treating a threshold as a suggestion.

“You’re very teachable,” he said, aware even as he said it of the condescension that might leak out and pleased when it did not. “You are good at letting a right thing be right even if you didn’t think of it.”

“I am a genius at taking orders from the correct people,” she replied with a grin that belonged on a warning label. “Tomorrow I’ll go back to yelling at cows.”

On a Saturday that had decided to be cold enough to turn breath into instruction, he drove out again towards the shed at the edge of the flower farm with a length of timber and a tin of oil in the passenger seat because things like to travel with their purpose. He carried the plank down to Willoughby’s empty workshop, and for a moment he stood and allowed himself an impersonation of prayer that owed nothing to gods and everything to benches. He cut the plank to fit the brace that had sagged; he sanded the edge just enough to forgive it for having been the wrong size previously; he oiled the surface with a satisfaction that would have embarrassed him had anyone been present to witness it. He left a note tacked under the bench, folded under the it’s-only-me modesty of a name: For Pop’s bench. Paid in tea and wet towels. —E.

On his way out he saw Greg step out onto the yard with two mugs and the niece in a pair of gumboots that had taken a vow to be pink. They stood together and looked not at the bench but at the little change in the air that happens when an object agrees to be itself. Greg lifted one mug in his direction and the motion did a lot of work on all their behalves.

In July, somebody’s cousin organised a trip to a tournament in Melbourne with the confidence of a man determining how a van might behave on the Hume with a group of people who all snored. Edwin declined without reasoning himself into knots and did so early so nobody would think he was ancient or coy. He said he would mind the hall and the beginners and the bin day, and he said it politely enough that they all forgot to argue. On the day of their departure he was waiting on his step when the van rolled past, and Rel whooped at the cartoon whale on Saffron’s hoodie and Tony threw him a packet of lollies like a benediction he intended him to ignore. He lifted a hand and did not find himself wanting to be in the van more than he wanted to be on the step. This felt like a degree granted after the deadline.

The night after the team left, Mr. Clegg knocked on his door with the hesitancy of a man who had never once had cause to admit uncertainty to anyone without an aisle seat and a pulpit. He held a plate covered clumsily with foil and an expression that could have been a threat or a welcome depending on which foot you had decided to lean on. He said that he had made a slice. He said he would not have anyone say that his street did not reciprocate. He said, with the grudging generosity that made his words worth keeping, that he had heard from a nurse that a neighbour had been the correct sort of nuisance at the hospital. Edwin took the plate and unfoiled it under the auspices of a man exposing a sculpture; the slice had the density of decisions made for other people. He cut two pieces and they ate them on the step in the manner of men who had once been kept apart by pointless definitions of standard. They talked about rain that might or might not arrive. They talked about cricket because it is a safe country for men with too many opinions. They did not talk about the day because they had already spoken it back into the world where it belonged and did not need to be repeated like a rumour.

The beginners kept showing up, which was both a surprise and a credit to the part of human nature that insists on testing itself against minor discomfort. He ran footwork, precise and cheerful. He used his patter and then, when they were listening against their will, told them the other thing. He showed one boy how to keep his point from wandering off like a toddler. He told a woman the age of his knee that if she believed her feet when they whispered she would not have to pretend at violence. He took a photo of the class after they had finished and given the room back, sweat doing its thing to the air, and he sent it to Rel with the caption: The civil service did good work. She replied with a picture of Biscuit asleep, tongue out, paws in an audition for clouds, and the words: The department of happiness reports satisfactory outcomes.

Later in the winter, there was a frost that put lace on everything and made the town look like somebody’s grandmother had been through. He stood on the veranda and watched the breath of the street appear and disappear without fuss. He thought about all the rooms he now belonged to that he hadn’t known how to even apply for. He thought about Willoughby’s pencilled advice, about Elbows are traitors and the way the young insist on breaking you just because they can, about standards as a kindness rather than a cage. He thought about his left hand’s truth and how often it had gotten him out of situations he would once have apologised his way into keeping. He thought about how to be of use. He found he had an answer, and it was a yes to a thing.

When he turned back towards his table, the manual lay open in the place the spine liked. He had left a pencil in the gutter of the page without really intending it. He picked it up and, after a pause that accepted the weather’s opinion of drama, wrote in his own faint hand, in the margin next to two men mid-argument with long blades: You can stop without becoming less. He put the pencil down where he would find it again. He folded a page of the council letter about the next skills afternoon into his pocket and went to knock on his neighbour’s door to ask if she wanted to use his car that day, because the clinic would be crowded and the Range would be fogged and because kindness sometimes needs wheels more than it needs theory.

Rel answered still buttoning her jacket, hair in a coil that admitted she had not had time to negotiate with it. She looked at him as if the day had tilted slightly into its correct shape. “You are going to be impossible when you’re eighty,” she warned him affectionately. “All these rules and the charm to sell them. Try to be someone the rest of us can bear.”

“I will age as an experiment in applied civility,” he promised, and she kissed the air near his cheek again, having decided this was the safest way to put a flag down in a territory that did not belong to anyone yet. They stood for a second longer than a second requires, then went their ways because chores have their dignity and tea their timeframe.

In the hall that afternoon a boy in a hoodie that made no sincere claim to fit stood under the photograph of the Starch Factory Co-op and looked up at the old faces long enough to set up a tent in that particular piece of time. He said, to the air, “I want to be in a picture that tells someone what to do,” and Edwin heard it because those words find the ears that have been preparing for them for a while. He nodded and said, in the simple tone he had earned by failing his metaphors enough times to be left with the honest ones, that there were places to stand for that. The boy took a plastic sword and made a promise to himself and then forgot it immediately because the body had, for a minute, a better use for him. And that would do. For a day in winter that had decided to be generous about it, that would be more than enough.
