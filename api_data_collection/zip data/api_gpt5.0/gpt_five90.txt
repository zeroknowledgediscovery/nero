Moss knew the towpaths like he’d sniffed them into being. The dog ran low and straight as an arrow, a shadow with a metronome tail, claws ticking on the ice-laced cobbles that dipped and rose around the Dudley canal. Lark Underbank sat astride him, boots hooked behind his shoulders, wind biting the tips of her ears. The tip of Wren’s Nest hill loomed like someone’s knuckle under the morning mist, and Castle Hill’s ruined keep looked watchful, windows black, a mouthful of old rock-teeth.

“Steady,” Lark said into the dog’s ear. Moss angled his head as if he heard English and only liked it on Tuesdays. That was their understanding: she talked, he moved, both of them pretending the other didn’t get the joke.

They cut under a bridge where soot had settled in a velvet line, and Lark’s hand brushed the underside of the arch. The brick was slick with centuries of breath—horses’, barge men’s, and the thin sigh of the earth itself. The canals were long songs and the mines were their echo chambers. If you were pixie and born below Dudley, you had to learn to hear both.

Her mother used to say: Listen to this town like it’s talking back. Listen to the way it remembers iron. And then she’d tap Lark between the eyes. This is the part that lies. Don’t let it.

Moss skidded, paws thudding. He’d scented something. Lark lifted her weight to give him room to choose and waited, breath held on the cusp of cold. Blue smoke rose in slow ropes from beyond the hedgerow, the Black Country Museum already cracking into life with its morning fires, bacon fat, and voices of school children pretending not to be nervous of coal. It muddied the air with history. She liked that. It made her less conspicuous.

“Left, lad,” she murmured. Moss didn’t left. He bristled, a ridge rising along his spine, and made a sound in his chest that, had it been words, would have been: Not now. No. Lark peered round his neck.

On the towpath ahead a snail-slick of light hung about knee height. That was wrong. Daylight didn’t hang like that this close to noon unless it was waiting for something; unless somebody had fastened it there.

“Grimble,” Lark said, and nearly bit her own tongue in annoyance, as if saying it could summon him.

And then he crawled out of the hedgerow like a bad joke told after a funeral: thin green coat, mottled with spit from the leaves, a cap too large for his head and the grin that never learned to keep its hands to itself. Grimble Jape. There weren’t many pixies with two names; it suggested someone once tried to give him a second chance and lived to regret the impulse. He brushed brambles from his sleeves and made a theatrical yelp when a thorn nipped him.

“You look windblown, Underbank,” he said. “Got your ears out like sails. Off somewhere fine?” His voice had a burr that belonged to Dudley, all the vowels softened like butter left too near a hob. When he talked, the hedges somehow leaned back.

“Work,” Lark said. “And none of yours.”

“That’s a mood. Mind if I—well I was going to tell you about the vicar and the milkmaid and the stoat.” He waggled his eyebrows, and Moss’s growl deepened. “Too early? Never too early,” he added, and launched into the story anyway.

Halfway through his first comparison, Lark put up her hand. “No. We’re not doing that,” she said. “There’s children over there.” She flicked her eyes toward the museum. In truth, there was no way the sound would carry. But it would carry to the old things under it, and Dudley had better ears than most.

Grimble’s grin faltered, then refashioned itself sharper. “You used to laugh.”

“I used to be nine,” Lark said, and slid off Moss’s back in one neat movement, boots landing in the cold grass with a scruff of noise.

He sucked his teeth. “Anyway,” he said with the wide magnanimity of someone about to do something unkind, “I came to warn you. Not even as a favor. Just my duty as a citizen of the lower tunnels.” He swept a hand, mocking the pose of a town crier. “Mind your steps. A hollow’s after you.”

“A hollow what?” Lark said, too quickly. Moss bumped her knee with the bright weight of his head. Gentle. Steady. You feel the wire? It’s there.

Grimble began to laugh. Not a giggle. Not a cackle. Some sound that tried to pass for laughter and didn’t earn the name. It shook her shoulders anyway. “Hollow like a hollow. A place that used to be solid and isn’t now, and has forgotten which side’s air. Mind how you walk; mind where you put—well. You know what you ought to mind.” He raised his eyebrows again in the way that made even the nettles look disgusted.

“Grim,” Lark said, “if you set this.”

“Me? Never,” he said, and spread his arms as if to show his vest for wires. His palms were clean. That meant very little. He rarely laid a trap with his own hands; he hired the town to do it with its own careless stories.

She could feel it now, the slack in the light where the day had been tugged and looped. The trap was a snare in time. Step into it, and you fell sideways into a minute that wouldn’t end until someone let you out. Brutal in its simplicity. She’d done something like it once with a scarf and a tune, but hers had been kinder. You had to hum to keep it alive, and if you stopped, whoever you’d caught got out again, annoyed and in need of tea.

“Right,” Lark said. “Moss, heel.” The dog came to her side, pressed there, all control, eyes on Grimble and then not, as if he didn’t want to give Grimble the pleasure of being looked at. “You’re in our way.”

“Am I?” Grimble took half a step and the light slick shifted. “What with your work and all,” he said, “and your letters and messages and your—what is it you do again? Skipping through cracks, talking to puddles?”

“Fixing leaks,” Lark said quietly. He knew very well. “You break jokes open and pour them into holes. Someone has to patch what seeps out of folk when they’re not watching.”

Grimble opened his mouth. Lark beat him to it with a fast draw. She unknotted the red tape looped round her wrist—red because that was the color that barked at the eye—and flicked it hard at the suspended bright. “Catch,” she told it, using the tone she used for Moss when a stick was involved.

The loop flew wider than physics allows. That was the point of pixie work: you decide the rules; the world nods and pretends surprise. The loop slipped round the trap and tightened like a polite noose. Lark pulled, and time pretended to be rope for her convenience. The slick of wrong daylight stuttered, then flopped into the red tape like a fish beaten tame. She stuffed it into an empty marmalade jar, and the day resumed, a school bell ringing cleanly in the distance as if it had been held underwater and just granted air.

Grimble’s eyebrows climbed into his cap. “Tenner says that leaks by suppertime.”

“Not if you stop telling it how,” she replied. “Go home, Grimble.”

“You ever known me to go home?” he said, plaintive, and for a heartbeat she saw the kid he’d been, dragging the hem of his shirt in the dirt, making faces at anyone who would look, because he thought looking meant liking. Then he stepped back into who he’d made himself. He set his hands on his hips, and he told another joke—shorter this time, and right on the line, about a parish noticeboard and a broken bell. Lark didn’t reward it. The air didn’t either. Something like tiredness passed across his face. “Huh,” he said, and stuffed his fingers in his pockets. “Watch yourself, Underbank. There’s other hollows.”

“You said a hollow was after me,” she said.

“Right,” he said, and gave her that grin that never stayed where it was put. “There are many of ‘em. Bye now.”

He slipped back into the hedge like something freed from a painting, and Moss exhaled with relief that sound like a small train. Lark rubbed his neck in a brisk circle. Her fingers came away with bits of thorn.

“Right,” she said. She eyed the jar, where the bright sat like a coiled coin, and tucked it into the satchel at her hip. The job, then. A curse-lip on a weir at Parkhead had been laughing at passing barges until the boatmen got nervous and stopped up the funnel with rags. Funny at first, not funny now; the canal could swallow a whole story without chewing, and who knows what shape it’d spit it back. She had the address for a tear in a garden wall, too, and a letter in her pocket that wanted to be taken to a person who didn’t want to be found. Busy day. Dogs love busy days. Pixies. Pixies cope.

Moss tasted the wind and took three steps that were, in his mind, ten. Lark laughed into his fur. “Okay. Off. Onward.”

The towpath widened, then narrowed again, then opened into a hush between small willows. A swan watched them pass with an expression of long-suffering nobility, one eye a coin, black pupil like the hole of a pinprick character flaw. Lark supposed if you were born dressed for a coronation, you could be forgiven for disliking visitors.

“Do you think he was trying to help?” she asked Moss. He made the sound that meant: doubtful. “Me too,” she said. “But you know. People surprise you. Even the ones who rehearse what they’re about to be.”

They crossed into the shadow of a bridge so old it had re-learned being stone out of sheer stubbornness, and, under it, the world changed key. The cold thickened, picked up a taste of cave. Lark smelled the coal that wasn’t there anymore, and the sweat that had been, and the words nobody let out while they worked. Moss slowed without being asked. If you were small, you could hear the dead drills and the chink of picks.

There was, too, a smell of something else. Lark felt her jaw tighten as if it wanted to bite down on a thought. She had a talent for naming stink: hot wires, brass, boiled cabbage, the breath of someone who ate anxiety for breakfast. This wasn’t a smell, not quite. It was the shape a smell would make if you opened it. A hollow. Not a hole. Holes are honest; they look like the absence they are. Hollows pretend. They borrow the look of a thing from its memory and wear it like a hat.

“Stop,” she said. Moss stopped. Lark dismounted and stood, boots ankle-deep in weeds, sense of scale all peculiar. A thin path veered off the towpath toward a fence. The fence had no gate. Still, the path insisted on its right to be walked. Lark sucked her teeth. “Stay,” she told Moss, and he obeyed with that insulted patience dogs do for the people they’ve adopted.

The path took her toward a pool that thought it was a puddle. It took her to flat ground that was anything but, and to a brick wall that had once belonged to someone’s kitchen. There was the impression of a window. Inside the window, a kettle that had never boiled had forgotten the trick of being tin. Lark knelt and placed the palm of her hand on the wall. It was the sort of cold that lived deeper than skin. She closed her eyes.

“I’m going to borrow your weather,” she whispered, addressing the ground. “I need your rain. I need yesterday’s rain. You held it. You remember. Give me a drip, a hiss, the aah when a dry thing swallows a wet thing. I need that sound. Right.”

She took the thin wooden box from her satchel and slid it open. Inside were five small things: a brass washer; a ring of jet; a button that remembered a different coat than the one it had died on; a glass bead that held a bubble of Dudley sky; a stub of pencil bitten into by someone living. The button liked to be used first; it was eager to be useful in the way of old buttons. Lark rubbed it between thumb and forefinger and hummed, a note that felt like something being carried across water on a foggy morning.

The wall shivered. Water answered. It wasn’t much: the suggestion of a drip, and then—because the world is vain and always looking for permission to show off—a soft hiss. The hollow bent toward the sound, like a cat making itself indifferent to a saucer of milk. The notion of the window gave a little. Lark breathed out, lengthening the note, and the glass bead warmed against her palm. A bubble rose inside it, popped, and released a strand of yesterday, all soft rain and laughter caught under an umbrella.

“Shhh, love,” Lark whispered, and coaxed, and made of herself the small instrument that was needed. After a few minutes, the hollow became not a hollow. It forgot itself and took up being a puddle. A good, honest puddle, with the color of sky in it and a leaf that couldn’t make up its mind to drown.

She reached in and pulled out the kettle. It was half itself, flimsy, tin remembering itself halfway and then forgiving itself the rest. She shook it and it made a sound like coins trying to agree with each other. “You came too, did you?” she said, and set it in the grass. “You’ll make someone a story, you will.”

She stood, catching sight of Moss, who watched like a sculpture with one moving eyelid. “Job’s a good ‘un,” she said. Moss wagged once large as a flag.

When she turned, she saw Grimble Jape, again. He had the grace to look sheepish, though with him it might have been constipation. He pushed his cap back with a finger. “Well,” he said. “Well. You and your box of tat. Efficient.”

“You said I was being chased,” Lark said. Calm made of work. “That the hollow was after me.”

“Maybe it was. Maybe it’s offended you’re better at being holes than it is.” He smirked. “I said I’d warn you.”

“You also laid a trap,” she said. She didn’t say: and it would have stuck me until you came back to explain your punchline. He knew.

“People don’t appreciate the fine art of a good gag anymore,” he muttered, picking at the hedge with a little stick he produced from his sleeve. “You say ‘stoat’ and everyone clenches. You say ‘bell rope’ and they start moving away as if it’s contagious.”

“That’s because you use them as weapons,” Lark said, and slipped the button back in the box, along with the bead and the ring, all of them humming softly at the touch of each other. “Jokes are for joining. You use them for trampling.”

“I don’t trample. I stride with purpose.” He stepped closer. “You haven’t asked what’s new with me. Rude.”

She inclined her head. “What’s new with you, Grimble?”

Now he lit up. “Ha!” He flung his arms. “I’ve got a job.”

Lark hadn’t expected that. “Doing what? And it had better not be ‘street entertainment’ or Dudley’s going to sue.”

He drew himself up. “Courier,” he said, with the proud hum of a kettle finding itself again. “Messages. Notes. Secret whispers. I pass ‘em on. For a fee. Do you know how many secrets this town thinks it can hide on paper? A paper is the least private thing, if you keep your eyes hungry.” He watched her face and preened when he saw something like worry. “What? Don’t you like competition?”

“You don’t read them, do you?” she asked, and regretted the question even as it left her mouth. It was like asking rats if they chew. It was in the nature of rats to chew. It was in the nature of Grimble to rummage with his gaze.

“Only the ones that ask me nicely,” he said. “And I only tell the ones who deserve the telling. I’m adding value. Think of me as a footnote with legs.”

“Grim,” Lark said, letting all the weight of his name lie down in the space between them. “If you start tearing at the under-threads of things… you know the sort of mess we live nearest.”

He tapped the side of his nose. “Do I! You are not the only student of leaks. Underbank’s not the only dam. And anyway,” he said, suddenly softer, “folk don’t listen unless you jab. They say they like gentle. They like sharp. They like the sting. It wakes them up, quick-like. And then they hate you for the waking. It’s nearly funny. And when things are nearly funny…” He trailed off, then shrugged hard enough that his coat made a sound like a sigh. “Well. Best actually be funny, then.”

It was the truest thing he’d ever said, and he knew it, and hated that someone else heard him having said it. He made to leave.

“Grimble,” Lark called after him. He paused, one foot already in the hedge. “Who hired you?”

He grinned over his shoulder. “A lady with gloves who doesn’t like puddles,” he said. “Said she heard your name in a crack.”

Fear is a smart thing. It never shows up as soon as you ask it. It’s late to the party, it knocks at the wrong door, it calls you by a name you understand only a week later. Lark felt a trickle of something then, the memory of someone else’s soup: cabbage, bay leaf, peppercorns. Someone who wore gloves. It meant nothing, or it meant everything. Moss leaned into her leg, and she steadied her knees with the heel of her hand.

“Cheers,” she said. “Tell your lady to mind her ankles. It’s flood season.”

“Everything’s flood season,” he said, and then—because he couldn’t resist—the one about the vicar and the stoat again, this time quicker, like a coin stolen and returned before you notice. He laughed at himself when no one else did, and he was gone.

They left the wall behind. Moss took up his rhythm, the particular clip-clop of a dog who thinks he’s doing sums with his feet. The museum noises grew and then shrank as wind sawed them into ribbons. Lark thought about the kettle. She tucked it deeper into her satchel, the metal too light to be sure of. It would rust in a story if she didn’t find it a kitchen. There was, she knew, a grandmother off Tipton Road whose memory stuttered in and out like a bad wireless. She would need a kettle that knew how to become itself twice.

By the time they reached Parkhead, the sun had rolled to the left shoulder of the day and stuck there, the way it liked to when frost fought dirty. The weir did have a lip, and the lip had a laugh, and the laugh was a thin, mean thing; it compared the keel of every boat to worse shapes and the hands of every barge man to smaller hands that shouldn’t be named. The water had turned the jokes into churned foam. Lark knelt and frowned at the spray.

“You,” she told the weir, which was rude, and the water respected it. “You like being the one who decides what’s said. I understand. Me too. But you’re sloppy. You’re laundering grimness and pretending it’s wit. I’m confiscating your mouth.”

She took the jet ring and kissed it. It was cold as old light. She slid it over the wrong lip of the weir and spoke three names: of a town that had its throat cut and learned to sing anyway; of a man who’d made saucepans with hands that had known a sharper metal; of her own, which the water already knew. The laugh died. In its absence, there was the sound of water being water—the best sound, if you needed reminding of what could still be done.

A barge nosed through, its engine a cough disguised as pride. The man at the tiller nodded without knowing to whom. That was fine. Lark preferred unthanked work when it was for a public good. Gratitude was a slippery fish; you thought you liked the feel of it and then you smelled like the river for the rest of the day.

They took their dinner on the grass, her cramped up against Moss, stealing heat, eating a heel of bread and a bit of cheese, sharing both, because that was the arrangement. She said “heel,” and Moss didn’t know which meaning she meant, but he shared anyway. His face when he ate cheese was more reserved than it was with sausage. A dog can do nuance. Their breath fogged together in a wet little cloud.

“Do you remember the one who wore gloves?” she asked him. He blinked. “No,” she said, answering herself. “You only notice people who smell like ham.”

He thumped his tail once, as if to say: inaccurate but harmless.

“Grimble with a job,” she observed to the sky, which ignored her, busy with crows. “That’s a stage of grief you have to watch for. Bargaining with legitimacy. He’ll do worse, thinking he’s doing good.”

On their way back, she stopped at a house with a weeping brick wall and spoke to a woman with eyes the color of tea left to stand, and told her where the leak in the family story was, and how to stitch it with a humming that even a hollow would think twice about crossing. She passed on the letter—a slim, sullen thing, reluctant to be found. It pinched her fingers when she put it into the hand that was waiting. Words have edges. The recipient said “ta” into Lark’s shoulder and then pretended she’d not done it. Lark did the polite thing and pretended she had not noticed.

Evening came on with city-cold, made of stone and old ash. Moss sped up because tea might be waiting, in the way dogs love tea without knowing what it is. The world fussed around them. They cut past the castle’s foot, the ruined tooth above them now a silhouette, a warning to any story that thought it could outlast rock.

At the bottom of the hill, under the droop of a willow whose roots had found an old drainage pipe and adopted it like a child, a small boy hunched. He had those thin bones that look like notes on a staff, and a red hat too flush with pride. He met Lark’s eye without flinching. “Mam says you’re daft,” he announced.

“She must be right,” Lark said. “Mams tend to be.” She noticed the scrape on his knuckles, and the way he hid his hands not to be caught hiding them. Moss sniffed his shoes with respect. The shoes had gone places.

He screwed up his face in interest. “Are you a fairy?” he said, and then flushed, anticipating the rebuke.

“Pixie,” Lark said. “Different unions.” She lifted a corner of her coat to reveal the small stitched badge: a needle crossed with a feather. “We do the light lifting. You?”

“I steal mint leaves from the allotments,” he said, then, in a rush, “because my baby sister laughs at the smell.”

“That’s work,” Lark said gravely. “Your Mam’s right, then. We’re both daft.” She fished in her pocket. Her fingers found three things: a cinnamon button from someone’s coat, a marble the color of cat’s eyes, and a promise someone had forgotten to pick up. She set the button in the boy’s hand. “For your sister’s cardigan. When it loses one. It will. There’s always one that pops into a gap and goes to live with the teaspoons.”

He looked at it like it was coins in a different currency that he’d suddenly learned to count. “Thanks,” he muttered, then darted away in five different directions at once. His hat bobbed. Knot of red. Gone.

She loved this job, Lark thought, at the same time she considered quitting it and walking into the canal until the water came up to meet her eyes. The canal would understand. It was built for carrying, and some days she felt like she’d let herself be cargo for too long. Moss bumped his head into her hip, and life, like a switch thrown, returned to the business of being.

They reached the bricked mouth that led to the ladders and lower ways. The underside smelled like chalk and old songs. Lark slipped into it with the easy muscle memory of someone returning to a room she never left even when she was away. Moss’s nails clicked on metal rungs as he worked his complicated dog way down, hindquarters being both brilliant and clumsy, because physics is rude to dogs. At the bottom, the air pressed in, friendly and weighty. Lark took the jar from her satchel. The trapped slick of day twitched like a jelly, unsure whether to behave now that it was underground.

She set it on a shelf of rock and tapped the lid with one fingernail. “Listen,” she said to the bright. “You were dragged thin on the surface and made to behave as rope. Here, you can learn another shape. We’re the right sort of dark for teaching. But you mustn't go running round doing as you like; we’ve stone with better manners than daylight, and it'll tell you off.”

The bright settled. If she cracked the jar tomorrow, it would make short work of a spell that forgot how to stand. Everything could be repurposed. That was the rule she believed, perhaps too much. It had kept her safe this long—her and Moss and the people who let her in their kitchens when the kettles remembered how to behave.

Down here, voices flickered and went out, the way candles do when you don't look at them straight. “Underbank!” a voice called, and made a greeting of her name.

It was Bluebottle, who wasn’t blue at all, and only bottle-shaped when he fell asleep in a corner and did that thing with his spine. He wore his hat too small and the pride inside him too large. He had three children and they were all the sort of children that could reorder a room’s furniture just by saying hello. “You took your time,” he groused, which meant: I missed you and it frightened me a little. “We’ve been discussing the market. The new one. Up the hill. They’re selling stories like they’re pies.”

Lark groaned. “They always forget to tell people how to eat them. Everyone loses their knife skills around a tale. They chew and swallow and then something gets stuck.”

“We thought maybe you’d—” He paused. “Well. We thought maybe you’d go look. You’ve the face for saying no in a way that makes them understand yes. And Moss looks good next to a table. He keeps the flies from landing.”

Moss hawked a soft bark and preened in a way only a dog can without becoming unbearable.

“I’ll go,” Lark said. “Tomorrow. Today was already a week long. I pulled a kettle out of a window that wasn’t so sure about itself.”

Bluebottle’s eyebrows made a shape like skeptical crows. “You want tea?”

“Always,” she said.

They made it in a battered pot with a lid you had to hold just so. People drifted in and out. A violin tuned itself shyly in the next chamber. Stories collected and ran down the walls like condensation. You had to stay on top of the ones that tried to grow moss, or they’d take root and you’d have to live with them forever. She sat on the floor and let her shoulders drop and listened to the hum of her own bones, the one that told her she had done enough for the hours allotted. Moss settled with a thump and dreamed right away, paws lifting, chasing something he knew how to catch.

When she closed her eyes, she saw Grimble’s grin. She saw the hollow trying on a wall like a shirt. She saw a glove. Pale leather. Stitched carefully. A hand that didn’t like to be touched by the world.

She opened her eyes. The kettle sighed. Bluebottle was telling a story about the time he had accidentally married a fog on the ridge by Netherton and how, ever after, his hair was always damp and once he had to go to Wales to fix the misunderstanding. Lark laughed, the sort of laugh that makes a new shelf in the day. She needed those. Moss’s ear twitched, agreeing.

“Underbank,” Bluebottle said after the third cup, softer. “Grimble’s been sniffing round the message holes. Reading labels. That boy’s going to get lead-poisoned in his mouth, the way he bites ink.”

“He says he’s a courier,” Lark said.

“He says a lot of things. One day he’ll tell one too many and it’ll tell him back.” Bluebottle rubbed his cheek with his thumb, a nervous tic, like polishing an afterthought. “Mind your feet. The stones have been shifting. The winter does it. The stories do too. And there’s talk of someone who doesn’t like puddles.”

“There’s always someone who doesn’t like puddles,” she said. “They’re the same people who don’t like knees.”

Bluebottle snorted. “The ones who wear gloves.”

This, more than anything, made the back of Lark’s neck go hot. She didn’t know why. She made herself breathe, made herself stop turning consequences over like cards. “We’ll mend it,” she said. “We always do.”

“Until we can’t,” he said, and then, quickly, seeing her mouth: “But that day is not this day. Don’t go borrowing fear on interest, Underbank. It’s a usurer.”

She got up. The muscles of her legs made their small complaints. She kissed Moss on the skull between his ears, and he made that happiness-sigh that lets you know the world can carry you one more time. She walked to the ledge where she kept her tools, adjusted the red tape so it was coiled and neat, slid the box into its place, set the jar to the left, to teach it left from right. The kettle sat there too, honest again and trying to be useful by being metal. It was enough.

Outside, the wind picked up. It had the smell of iron left in a shed too long. It had the taste of someone telling a joke to the wrong person at the wrong time, and then blaming the person for being wrong. It had a glove in it.

Sleep didn’t come quick. When it did, it arrived like a dog who has made himself indispensable and now wishes to be appreciated for it: heavy, warm, and a little drool. Lark dreamed of moss growing over knives. She dreamed of a town turning its pockets out, and handing her the lint.

In the dream, Grimble stood on top of Castle Hill in a coat that didn’t suit him and shouted something rude at thunder. The thunder laughed, not because it was funny, but because it wanted to be polite. And under the hill, the hollows shifted, and a hand in a glove went hunting for a latch.

Before dawn, Moss woke with the suddenness of a thought. He went from asleep to sentinel in a click, nails on stone like a question mark puncturing air. Lark was up too. If you lived long with something that loved you as a job, you learned to be awake in the spaces where danger could be a joke or a promise. She took the jar in her hand and held it like a lantern. The bright inside remembered how to shine when asked with the right tone.

In the lobby of the tunnels, where the bricked entrance met the chalk like a handshake, a gust of cold shouldered in. Not the kind from winter. The other kind. The kind that comes from under a door that doesn’t lead to a room you know. It smelled like beeswax and the inside of a book. It made the hair on her arm lift.

When the glove reached in, it did not touch anything. It did not need to. It fumbled, finding the latch it wanted, and lifted. Something in the stone went yes. A line in the wall shortened. A crack that had been a crack woke up and said: door. Lark held up the jar. The bright flared like someone’s last good idea.

“Not yet,” Lark said to the glove. She spoke to it in the language of polished things, the tongue of surfaces that brag. “You’re too clean to come down here. We’re offensive to you. We’ll stain.”

The glove paused. The jar’s bright snapped at it like a tethered thing tired of tether. The glove retreated. The crack became an idea again, too shy to be a door when stared at.

When it was gone, Lark’s knees remembered they were knees. She put the jar down with care. Moss leaned his whole dog against her in a controlled collapse. “Tomorrow,” she told him, and meant: everything will be worse tomorrow. “We’ll go have a look at the market. We’ll find the lady who doesn’t like puddles. We’ll ask her why she’s opening doors that don’t belong to her.”

Moss put his head on her foot and sighed yes as if he had a vote in all this and it counted. Lark stroked his ear and thought of jokes that hurt and jokes that healed and where the line might be. It moved too, like a weir lip under fast water. She would need her box. She would need her tape. She would need all the small craft of naming and un-naming. And she would need Moss’s nose and Bluebottle’s children’s laughter and the way the weir behaved when reminded of its own name. She would need Dudley, old and stubborn and full of iron ghosts. She would need a kettle, too, for the comfort of steam.

Above them, the castle bit at the moon. A heron flew across the canal like a long thought, all worry and elegance. Down here, Lark’s heart settled into its Dudley beat. She had work. She had a dog. She had a town that was a book with a few pages torn and several stuck together and a handful hidden under the mattress.

She patted her pockets. The glass bead winked against her finger. She let it. It was enough of a light to carry them until the morning, which would come when it decided to, early or late, arrogant as always, wearing yesterday like a badly hung coat. She slept with her hand open. The bright watched their breathing and tried to learn how.Chapter 3

Morning did not so much arrive as arrive and apologize for the way it had done so. It nosed in with a grey that had no courage for white and no decency to be properly dark. Down in the lower ways the cold came through the chalk like a polite guest who meant to stay until lunch. Lark rose from her bed-roll with the stiffness of someone who had slept near her work and dreamed near her worries. Moss thumped his tail once against stone and then again, deciding he had better make it a matched pair to bring luck. She sat up and checked her tools with the habitual touch of a musician tapping her case—red tape coiled, box of bits where she put it, jar with the slick of stolen brightness glowering like a scolded cat. Everything sulked in the right place. That was as good a start as anyone could ask of a day in Dudley.

Bluebottle had left a tin mug by her head with tea inside it gone to the exact temperature at which tea tells you it would have been happier hotter. She drank it anyway and felt her soul remember the idea of warmth. Above, the museum’s morning smoke was already finding the cracks, sneaking down in little ropes and turning the air into something you could chew if you wanted the taste of last century on your tongue. She liked the way it settled in the tunnels, like an uncle who knew when to leave the room. The dead liked it too; they hummed more when the smell of coal was around, as if soot had been their second language.

Bluebottle wandered in with his hat even smaller than yesterday and a layer of pride so thick you could use it to seal a draft. “Market’ll be halfway up and halfway wrong by now,” he said, scratching his chin as if he were trying to start it. “I sent Clatter with word you were coming.”

“Which one’s Clatter?” Lark asked, though she knew. Clatter was all knees and conviction and a voice that made tables behave.

“The one who thinks elbows are an instrument,” Bluebottle said, satisfied with the identification. “He’ll be near the pies. He says it’s important to learn the competition’s crust.”

Moss made the face he saved for pastry and ducks. He considered both worthy of attention and unworthy of trust. Lark tousled his ears and stood. “I’ll go before someone buys a ballad and tries to eat it with their fingers,” she said. “Keep an ear on the lower way door that’s trying to be a door. If it flirts again, tell it I’m engaged.”

Bluebottle performed an elaborate shrug that managed to be both skeptical and grateful. “If the lady with gloves comes back, I’ll show her the sluice and see if she likes being damp behind the eyes,” he said, cheerfully vicious, which meant he was worried in that practical way of his.

Outside, the frost had crept back in the night and licked everything it could reach, which in Dudley is more than you’d think. The canal wore a skin of ice so thin it had decided to be decorative. Moss tested it with a paw and retreated with the offended dignity of one who has discovered a chair moving under him. The sky was a kindness worse than a cruelty: neither drama nor relief. They went along the towpath, then up through a slot of alley that always smelled like cabbage peel and soap, and then through a skein of back gardens where every fence had once been something else—a bed frame, a bit of barge, a memory of scaffolding. Dudley did repurposing the way other towns did Christmas.

The market had unpacked along the ridge below the big Tesco like a rash that happened to have trinkets. The new pitch was all the rage because it gathered three winds and a hundred opinions, which is as good as location gets in a place that learned how to make weather out of gossip. Stalls with awnings flapped that had not flapped yesterday. Someone had stretched bunting made of cut-up maps, and the towns on the triangles had taken offense and turned their letters upside down. Lark saw a table piled with little bottles, each with a scrap of hymn trapped inside like a bluebottle under a tumbler, and a man selling teaspoons engraved with other people’s advice. There were pies, yes, solid ones you could bite, and pies you ate with your head tilted because they were made of talk and would try to dribble out of your ears.

Clatter found them before they found him, emerging from behind a cart loaded with something described as “Authentic Black Country Syllables” and “Special Offer: Buy Two Vowels, Get a Consonant Free.” He had three freckles like spilled ink and a smile that was its own argument. “Underbank,” he said, breathless, and then remembered to nod to Moss as an equal. “They’ve got a storyman cutting tales into slices, like pork. Says he can take the fat off grief if you bring him enough sugar.”

“That’s unhygienic,” Lark said. “And untrue. Where’s he set up?”

Clatter pointed with his chin, the way of someone who had learned not to make his hands complicit in other people’s nonsense. He led the way through a row of hats that all looked like they had been born hat on hat crime, past a woman selling umbrage by the ounce and a boy doing sketches of people’s shadows and charging extra if the shadow argued. The storyman had a trestle painted with roses and a knife that had never cut meat. He wore a white apron as if that lent him authority or innocence. He was slicing a long, pale slab of something—a narrative reduced to its marrow, from the look of it—and parceling it into paper.

“Three for a pound,” he crooned to a woman with a baby who was using her mother’s scarf as a rope. “I’ll trim out the bitterness. You won’t taste it. No need, not these days. People like the sweet bits. Teeth’re a nuisance.”

Lark’s skin prickled in a way she had learned to respect. Stories have bones for a reason. You can’t stand anything up without something hard inside it. She stepped closer and saw, sure enough, the little white slivers being flicked aside into a bin as he cut. “What do you do with those?” she asked, too casual, watching his hands.

“Dispose,” he said, and smiled at her. He had teeth like someone who’d cheated his dentist and won. “Health and safety.”

“May I?” She didn’t wait for permission. She reached into the bin and took two of the thinnest bones. They were light under her fingers, but not faint. They were the clean thin of a truth told plain. She slipped them into her coat pocket next to the glass bead, and the bead made a tiny noise like approval in a different language.

“Oi,” the man said, offended without committing to being offended. He had seen something in her face not to challenge. “If everyone took the bits they don’t want, I’d have no waste.”

“If everyone took the bits they need, you’d have no business,” Lark said, and smiled back, and let him be flummoxed by which sort of smile it was. “Mind how you trim. Hollow words are tinder.”

He sniffed and looked over her head at his queue, which was the sort of decision men make when they must choose between being right and being paid. Lark drifted sideways, making space for Clatter to do the pixie trick of being unnoticeable until it mattered. Moss lifted his nose and sifted the air. He didn’t like the smell by the slicing table; it had the sharp of blunted knives and the sweet of being lied to nicely. He dragged Lark with a lean toward another stall, one that had a good dog smell to it—rope, wood, old biscuits, the tang of hands that had been outdoors.

The good smell belonged to a woman in a skirt the color of dock leaves and a jacket that had been a green bus. She was selling promises in jam jars and had arranged them by weather. “Sunny break, showers, three days of steady bravery,” the labels said. She glanced up as Lark approached, saw what she saw, and nodded in the specific way of someone who had chosen to be on Lark’s side without asking why. “Mind your pockets,” she said under her breath, and then, louder, for the crowd, “Two for a quid, and if your Auntie’s ankle’s playing up, I’ve got something that’ll make it think it’s turned sixteen without being stupid about it.”

“Anyone curious been sniffing round?” Lark asked, ducking her head like a buyer considering jars.

“Several, and one of them a man in a cap with too many jokes in his pockets,” the woman said, and forgot to keep her voice loud. “He stayed long enough to be told to not touch the lids. The other was a lady in gloves who smelled of old libraries and leather polish. She didn’t mind the weather but she minded the mud. She’s set up over there near the bandstand with a table that thinks it’s a sermon.”

Lark felt her shoulders remind her they existed. “Bandstand’s a good place for a sermon,” she said. “The band might shout it down by accident. Cheers.”

As they moved along, Moss suddenly put his ears back and made a small sound in his throat. The sort of sound that means: a fox has been here, or something that wishes it were a fox. Lark followed his gaze and saw Grimble before he could shape himself into being seen. He had acquired a satchel, brown with the pride of being new, and a shock of peacock ribbon he had tied round it as if to pretend the satchel had asked for a bow. He was leaning against a pillar with all the nonchalance of a man who had rehearsed it alone and could not remember his lines now he had an audience.

“Underbank!” he called, turning surprise into a weapon. “I’ve already delivered two confidences and a postcard with a very rude joke about porridge. I’m absolutely flying.”

“Mind your height,” Lark said. “Altitude sickness makes you say things you’ll have to live with.” She pressed a hand to Moss’s neck and felt the quiver settle. “What sorts of confidences, and to whom?”

Grimble waggled a hand as if to show that the world was in it and he wasn’t responsible for the weight. “The sort that begin ‘don’t tell Lark’ and end with a money amount,” he said, and then grinned at her to see if the grin would take the sting out. “I’m kidding. Nobody said your name out loud. They just spoke it in their throats.”

“Have you met her?” Lark asked, not rewarding the rest with an expression. “The glove-wearer.”

Grimble’s grin took a step to the side. He shrugged with the drama of someone who wants to be pushed. “She doesn’t like finger marks,” he said. “You’d think she didn’t like fingers. Even when she shakes your hand she doesn’t, because whether or not she is wearing them, her fingers are always a glove about to happen. She’s got a way of talking like she ironed her words, with starch.”

“What does she want?” Lark said, though she thought she knew. People like that want the same thing always: they want the world to behave well in display.

“To tidy,” Grimble said, surprised into honesty. “To get the stories in boxes with nice labels. To have the hollows stop tripping people up. She says she’s going to seal the cracks so the lower ways stop being drafty and stoped.” He paused. “She said it that way, like a wall that won’t lend you a verb. She says the museum should be the museum of the living thing, not the dead bit. She wants to make tours.”

“Of what?” Lark asked, a bile in her mouth that only comes when a person takes your own thoughts and mashes them into something you wouldn’t feed a cat.

“Her face,” Grimble said, and hiccuped a laugh he regretted. “Come on. She’s got cakes and a banner. You like a good banner. Moss likes a good cake.”

Moss did not want cake on principle unless it had grease in it. He wanted to sniff the woman Grimble had already made into a shape. He wanted to know whether her gloves smelled like the glove he had seen through the crack—the cold cuff-smell, the beeswax, the itch of paper kept away from fingers. Lark made herself walk with the steady of a person who doesn’t walk; she let the crowd move around her and pretended to be moved by it.

The bandstand had always looked like it had wandered into Dudley by accident and stayed out of politeness. Today it wore a banner that read: The Society for Preservation and Clarity. Beneath it, a table had laid itself out obediently with cloth, brochures, and a bell. The bell was not a bell; it was a bell-shaped idea with a small lip that meant it would talk back if you touched it wrong. Behind the table stood a woman in a coat the color of new paper. Her hair was folded in a shape that had read the manual for itself and obeyed. She wore gloves, of course—cream, and so clean it was rude—and they had a stitching along the outside as if they wished to be remembered by their seams.

Lark had expected age because of the beeswax smell, but the woman was no older than Lark by the look of her neck. Her eyes were a blue that did not belong to sky but to porcelain that had frightened children into behaving near mantels. She saw Lark and saw Moss and saw their edges in the way people like her do: as things to be rounded.

“Good morning,” she said, in the voice of someone who has practiced brisk kindness in mirrors. “I am Mrs. Harrow. You must be Ms. Underbank.” She said it like she had taken her gloves off to shake and then remembered she hadn’t, and put them back on faster than thought.

“Mistress,” Lark said, and saw the twitch. “For my sins.”

Mrs. Harrow smiled the small part of her face that had been granted the day off. “We’d like to speak about coordination,” she said. “Your activities and our mission. We believe we can help each other.”

“Your mission?” Lark said, aware that her own vowels had slid nearer to the hob. “The sort you put in a frame?”

“To protect this town from its own indulgence,” Mrs. Harrow said, and put a brochure in Lark’s hand, daring her to smudge it. “To gather its history where it belongs. To prevent mishaps. The lower ways are charming but unsafe. The canals leak into the civic mind. There are—incidents.” Her eyes lingered, no accident, on the jar in Lark’s satchel. “We need to channel the narratives into safe conduits. Label them. Archive them. Present them. No more… improvisation. No more dampness where order should be. Puddles breed. One becomes five. Then everyone gets their feet wet and calls it character.”

Lark looked at the brochure because she needed her eyes to be doing something that wasn’t setting things on fire. There were photographs of tidy children in laminated vests looking at displays that didn’t look back. There were words about belonging and heritage that tasted like someone had left a plastic ruler on a radiator. She thought of kettles that couldn’t remember tin. She thought of a jar that held a minute in a loop like a fish gone stupid at the sight of light. She thought of Bluebottle’s damp hair and his stories that breathed on you when you sat near them. She put the brochure down with the gentleness one reserves for angry dogs and ticking mechanisms.

“What happens,” she asked, “to the stories you tidy?”

“They become available,” Mrs. Harrow said. “Accessible. Clear. Safe. We remove the parts that disturb unnecessarily. We make sure no one trips. We ensure the narratives overlap correctly. We close the… hollows. I don’t like the word. It makes people think of melancholy. I prefer… lacunae.” She pronounced it as if it were a pudding.

“Do you sew?” Lark asked, and smiled. “My Mam always used to say it’s the bits you cut away that make the dress sit wrong, if you’re not careful. Less isn’t always tidy. Sometimes it’s bare.”

Mrs. Harrow’s pupils didn’t move, but something around them flinched. “We would like to contract you,” she said, blunt now that the courtship had stepped on its own hem. “You have a set of skills. We could provide support. Access. Protection. If you would stop these… freelance repairs. You could advise. From above. With gloves.”

Lark looked at Moss because that’s who you look at when you need a gauge for the weather inside your chest. He looked back at her with his look that meant: ham? The answer was obviously no and always will be, but he liked to be clear. She thought about money. She thought about safety, and how it looks like a kind stranger until you remember it does not love you. She thought about a door that had tried to lift itself into function in the night. “I’ll think on it,” she lied, because she wanted to see where Mrs. Harrow’s edges were without her going to ground. “We have a leak today at the market. The man cutting bones off stories is going to make someone choke.”

As if on cue, because the world is vain and enjoys good timing, a small situation unrolled itself three stalls away. A boy with snot dried on his upper lip had purchased a slice of something that had once been a fairy tale and was now a white wedge in greasy paper. He had taken a bite and then another and then discovered his throat had opinions. His face had gone the particular purple of regret. His mother hovered with panic like a scarf she could not take off. People stood in the way, doing the thing crowds do, which is to make problems more public and less solvable.

Lark did not wait for permission from Mrs. Harrow or the laws of physics. She ran with Moss alongside, the two of them a practiced machine. She slid into the space that had opened itself reluctantly and put her hand under the boy’s jaw as if she had known him since he’d fallen off a back step. “Love,” she said, low, because panic likes to be spoken past. “You’ve swallowed a bone that doesn’t belong to your throat. You are not a story with a spine. Let’s teach you to be only a boy for a minute.”

He made the sound of a person negotiating with his own breathing. Lark took the kettle from her bag without thinking. The tin remembered how to be hot in a way kettles do when they are near need; it hummed. She tapped the boy’s sternum gently with the lip, above the soft part where people store their scared. She took the glass bead and pressed it hard into the bone at the base of his throat, right where voice lives. “You are water,” she told the bone inside him, speaking not to him, not to the story, but to the idea of stuckness. “You are not a beam to hold up a lie. Flow. Flow round. Find out. Go back where you are important.”

The bead warmed. The kettle sighed out a puff that could not be steam but was. The boy hiccuped and sobbed and then spat a small white splinter into her palm. It was neat as a fingernail and sharp as a decision. She showed it to him and to his mother and to the storyman who had arrived with indignation already preparing its defense. “You keep these?” she asked him, and he shook his head with the stupidity of someone caught with both hands in both tills. “Do. Don’t throw them away. Glue them back in. Feed them to your own work. You’ve made a plate of sugar and it’s going to rot more than teeth.”

Mrs. Harrow had followed, to her credit quickly, to her detriment too late. She took in the bead, the kettle, the white bit in Lark’s hand, the boy already returning to his mother’s shoulder as if born there, and she reset her face to sympathy and constructive feedback. “This is exactly what we want to prevent,” she said, not meaning the same thing Lark did. “Training. Standards. Oversight. We—”

“—are selling maps without dirt on them,” Lark said, not looking at her. “Stop calling your wanting to be in charge something noble. Your glove reached under my door last night and tried to make a crack be a door. If you want to come down, learn to bleed a bit. Otherwise you’ll stain, and I won’t be sorry.”

Around them the market made the sound markets do when embarrassed for someone else. It shuffled. It coughed. It rearranged its belts. Mrs. Harrow absorbed it like a person who had learned long ago to be bulletproof where it showed. Her mouth took on the small line of someone filing this under Later. “I will try again, Ms. Underbank,” she said. “You will say yes. You will when the tide starts to lift the paving. You will when you see what it is I have to stop.” She turned, lifted her bell, and rang it not with her arm but with her will. The sound that came out was not a note; it was a decision. People turned their heads like sunflowers at a lie. Grimble clapped as if something had been performed well and went red when he realized no one joined in.

“Come,” he whispered to Lark, a rare word for him. “Don’t scrap out here. She will drag you into a definition and tie you with it.”

“I need to buy a pound of envy and a yard of forgiveness,” Lark said, because admitting to retreat is a gift you give the wrong person. Grimble tugged at her sleeve anyway, and Moss tugged at her in agreement, and between the two of them she found herself three stalls down before she remembered to resent it.

They stood near the back, where the market kept its modesty—a man with second-hand saucepans, a woman with roasting tins and a fondness for telling you their history as if that added metal. Lark bought a tin because she liked the way it warmed her palm and because it would make the kettle feel less alone. She slipped the bone from the boy into the pocket with the others and felt them sit there like small swords she might need to swallow later.

“Do you think she opened the crack, or does the crack like her?” she asked Grimble without looking at him.

“Cracks don’t like anyone,” he said. “They live to test you. But some hands make them curious. Gloves say: here is someone who thinks there should be no scratches. That’s like telling a cat to cease its whiskers. The crack will want to show it off.” He hunched his shoulders, and for a second he looked like the boy he’d been again, all cheek and bruise. “She makes a person want to kiss her or throw a stone. She makes you choose where to plant your mouth. It’s nearly a talent.”

“It’s a talent,” Lark said. “But we don’t have to be the audience who claps for it.”

They spent an hour in the market doing what one does at markets—cowardly buying, brave not-buying, tasting things that would taste worse in a kitchen and better in the open air. Clatter turned up with three sticks of rock and an optimism that could fell a wall if you leaned it right. Moss found a butcher who had dropped a sliver of something and did not notice it being thanked for. Lark listened more than she spoke and, when she spoke, she did so in the tone you use with nails: friendly to the head, firm with the point.

She let herself be seen by Mrs. Harrow two more times because there is a power in being predictable only when you choose to be. The second time, Mrs. Harrow was talking to a man in a suit whose cufflinks had ideas above their station. The third time, Mrs. Harrow was alone, writing names in a small book with a pen so thin it might have been a hair pulled from a horse’s tail. Each time she looked up and smiled and did not need to say: remember we began talking. It lay there between them like a bridge with a toll paid in yet.

“D’you think she truly doesn’t like puddles?” Clatter asked, a little awed by the thoroughness of a person’s preferences.

“Some folk don’t like seeing where the sky’s been,” Lark said. “And some don’t like the idea of something shallow being deep enough to drown a fly. Puddles’ offense is that they make you look twice. People like Mrs. Harrow want once to be sufficient. They want a single take.”

“Do you think she can do harm?” he asked. He said it like asking if weather could be persuaded to deliver a letter.

Lark opened her mouth and then shut it as the market tilted. It was a small shift, the sort that most feet don’t feel until they are on their backsides. But if you listen the way she did, you could hear the inching of weight from one story to another. The ground under the trestles remembered that it had been fields and then pits and then settlement, and that memory, laid on thick by the way people laid their voices, got ambitious. A stall leg slipped and then caught itself with the dignity of someone who had stumbled and made it look like dancing. The table with the hymn bottles rang as if a hand had passed through it. The jars shivered and the hymns inside took the opportunity to try for elsewhere.

Lark moved without making it look like movement. She stepped one foot into the imaginary path between two arguments and got hold of the closest bottle. It had “Nearer, My God, to Thee” inside it and had always resented the possessive. It wanted to be “Nearer” and to whom was its business. She tapped its lid and spoke to it as if it were a horse. “You were sung once when people were already in the water,” she said. “You don’t need to spill now. It’s cold and you’ll waste yourself trying to warm hands that won’t stop shaking.” The bottle settled. The other bottles, like people, were cowed by leadership. They stopped rattling. The stall’s owner gave Lark the sort of nod that goes into the sort of story that gets told across years without names and feels like a blanket.

Under her boots she felt the hollow turn over and go back to sleep, like a cat that has decided not to knock a glass off a table for now. She could almost taste Mrs. Harrow’s attention on the back of her coat, a gaze as neat as a row of stitches. It would not do to give in to the wanting to run. Better to saunter and leave a draft and measure who shivered.

Back in the underways, afternoon pretending itself toward evening, the cold decided to be a person of faith and persisted. Lark and Moss took the long walk down because some days the short way looks like bragging. Bluebottle met them without the pretense of having been doing something else. He took one look at Lark’s face and said, “She wears cream gloves, doesn’t she.”

“Cream as an apology after a bad joke,” Lark said, and set her satchel down. The jar within made the small exhale of a thing relieved to see rock. “She tried to hire me. She rang a bell that was a decision. There was a boy and a bone. Grimble got a ribbon.”

Bluebottle groaned and then smiled despite himself, because the image of Grimble and a ribbon is the sort of thing that makes a day a shade less heavy. “What did you answer when she tried to hire you?” he asked, though he knew the shape and wanted the sound.

“I said I’d think,” Lark said, and then rephrased it because truth is as much in the edit. “I lied to her, with kindness. It’s like tying a bow on a spider: it feels sweet and then it looks wrong.”

Bluebottle sat, which is not a small act when your back has done as many jobs as his. “You’ll have to go up to the Castle, then,” he said, as if he hated the idea with the full fairness of someone who knows the work must be done. “The old keep doesn’t like this sort of stirring. The hollows run under there like rat paths. If she’s got a bell that makes putting become happening, you’ll have to teach the hill to be deaf.”

Lark ran a hand down Moss’s spine and thought about deafness as a skill. “Tomorrow,” she said. “Tonight I need to not be noble. Tonight I need to feed this dog something that thinks sausage is a way of saying sorry.”

They ate under the arch with the mark where water stopped in a different year and had never yet quite left. Bluebottle had found a bag of potatoes that had grown to respect being potatoes and fried them with onion until they gave up their stiffness. The kettle made itself useful in the way things do when given a chance to be needed. Lark told the story of the boy with the bone in the voice she keeps for recounting other people’s danger when the danger is no longer present. Bluebottle told them about the time he had met a badger who taxed crossings and the coin had been a limerick about Wolverhampton. The children of the tunnels fell asleep in the corners the way kittens do, one foot in the air, a mouth open to catch unwary butterflies.

When most of the talking had settled into the stones, Lark took the bones from her pocket and set them out on a cloth. She did not want to like the look of them. She liked the look of them. They were spare and honest and had the decency not to ask to be more than they were. She picked up one and touched it to the red tape. The tape brightened the particular bright that is not light but readiness. “We might need a splint,” she told Moss, who put his chin on his paws and looked up with the sorrow dogs save for when you are doing something that is not about them. “You splint something with what it already is. Bone for bone. Truth for truth. If she starts knitting the town into a scarf, we’ll pull out one thread and watch it learn itself again.”

Moss sighed and scritched his ear with a very handsome hind leg. The tunnels breathed in and out. A trickle of water found a new route and made a map. Lark heard the faintest echo of Mrs. Harrow’s bell, not the sound itself but its absence, which is how a bell survives on silence. She swallowed the taste of starch.

In the morning—they had not yet reached it, but she felt it in the way the air gets ideas—she would go to the Castle and talk to stone. She would take the jar with the bright and she would ask the hill to lend her the trick of outlasting people who put themselves in charge. She would take Bluebottle if he could be spared, and Clatter for his elbows, and perhaps the woman with the dock-leaf skirt because she had the steadiness of someone who puts weather in jars and makes it behave. She would address the keep by the names it had kept to itself, the ones under the tourist boards. She would find where Mrs. Harrow had already laid her fingers and she would smear something very old and very rude on it until it remembered not to be clean.

Before sleep could invite itself, a flicker moved in the corner—a sliver of day that had learned to behave and then been allowed to show off. Lark crossed and tapped the jar with the nail of her little finger. “You did good,” she told it, and heard how the day thumped around inside, proud and sullen. “Tomorrow you’re going to frighten a bell and you can’t get puffed about it. Bells don’t stay bullied.”

A rustle at the entrance told her someone had come and meant to behave like a shadow. Grimble is incapable of behaving like a shadow; he has an outline that likes its job too much. He hung at the margin with a face that had not settled on mischief or confession. “Underbank,” he said, and when she looked up he remembered that his feet were his and walked them in. “Message,” he added, with a twitch toward the satchel.

“No reading?” she asked, because if some boundaries are not spoken they become scenery.

“I read the outer,” he said, which is to say he had fondled the envelope with his eyes until it told him some things and refused others. “She sent a card. It smells like being told to wash your hands.”

Lark held out her palm. The card was thick, a cream that wasn’t cream, embossed with an emblem that had ideas about laurel. The letters were pressed into it so firmly they had left their ghosts on the other side. She opened it and read: Tomorrow, midday. A demonstration. Castle Hill. A new door will open. We invite stakeholders. Please consider becoming a stakeholder. Appropriate footwear.

There was no signature. There was a watermark that had concealed itself into the texture until it felt like being smug and showed up as an old-fashioned key. Lark put the card on her knee and looked at it while not looking at it. “She’s going to show off,” she said. “She wants her bell to be a town crier. She wants to say the word ‘stakeholder’ and not have anyone bite it.”

Grimble squinted as if he could read more from her face than the card. “You going, then?”

“I am,” Lark said, and made her voice uninterested to hide that it was already thinking too fast. “So are you, and you’re going to stand where the wind can’t get under you because you have not got enough sense to stop courting pneumonia.”

He brightened in that unfairly handsome way a fool’s face can when given a job. “You want me to do anything?”

“Yes,” she said. “Watch her hands. Not the gloves. The hands under. See which finger moves first when she lies. Some folk lead with their thumbs.”

Grimble nodded, solemn because he had been made a part of a plan. He shifted, a fidget held in a shirt. “There’s talk she’s got a backer,” he said, trying to make it sound like a casual cough. “Someone who’s put money in and wants to fold everything trapezoid into squares.”

“You just wanted to say trapezoid,” Bluebottle muttered from his corner, as affectionate as a slap with a mitten.

“I did,” Grimble admitted. “And I enjoyed it.” He sobered. “They say the backer’s not local. They say it’s one of those clean outfits from the city. They wear black coats that don’t catch lint. They like names like Hub and Nexus. They like saying synergy and not being hit.”

“The city is a person,” Lark said. “And the person is hungry. We’ll see what it wants to eat. Go home, Grimble. And on your way, leave three bits of misinformation in three different pubs. Tell people the demonstration is tomorrow at one, then at three, then at never. Confuse the portions.”

Grimble put his hand over his heart and bowed with a flourish that would have been stronger if he hadn’t bumped his head on the lintel. “My art,” he said, rubbing the bump. “At last, recognition.”

He sloped out, humming a tune that had borrowed shoes. Lark watched the dark fill up the space he had been in and felt the sort of affection you feel for a wolfhound with manners. She unrolled her bedding and lay down with her hand open. Moss fitted himself to the curve of her knees with the satisfaction of an object designed to fit another object. The jar’s bright drew itself in, small, watching. The kettle did the thing good kettles do when the coals go to sleep: it took their heat into itself and promised to give it back later.

Before she let the dark button the room closed, she whispered the names of the hill, the ones that made her mouth feel like stone—Tumpside, Keep-tooth, Leasow’s Edge. She asked the hill to meet her halfway. She asked the old rock to forgive the people running new stitches into old cloth. She asked for a good wind at her back and for Mrs. Harrow’s bell to crack itself on her refusal. Moss breathed and turned the sort of sigh that is both an answer and an oath. Outside, frost decided to rehearse for dawn. Inside, Lark arranged her bones as if they were reasonable and planned to be again in the morning. The lower ways held them and said nothing. As teachers go, silence is underrated but thorough.Chapter 5

By the time the castle tired of holding its breath and let out the sigh it had been nursing since the demonstration, the whole hill had learned the new trick of being slightly wrong. Sightlines that had been faithful for centuries drifted by a finger’s width. A path forgot one step and remembered another. Even the pigeons adjusted the angles of their contempt. Lark felt it in the bones of her shins and the back of her teeth, that offness, like a song you had known all your life that suddenly took a harmony you hadn’t approved. Moss noticed it first, because dogs are instruments tuned for undernotes; he angled his head to one side until his ear made a sail of itself and he could catch what the hill murmured when it thought stone could keep secrets better than it can.

They went up early before the traffic woke and decided to play chicken with the roundabout. Frost lay in the heather like regret. The keep stood ungenerous as ever, the ruin of it holding itself like a dignified person who’d had the rudeness to survive too much and had learned to make of survival a manner. Lark put her hand on the wall the way she would touch a shoulder of someone she knew who needed to stop pretending they were fine. The rock was not fine. It had a fever from being handled by the wrong kind of clean.

“You let them put a lip on you,” she said to the keep, because intimacy with places forgives insults. “It isn’t you. It’s a frame. It thinks it’s helping.”

The new door was not a door so much as the promise of one. Mrs. Harrow had erected a clever frame of polished iron and cream paint, with a plaque that hadn’t yet won an argument with the wind. It faced the town like a beautifully mannered apology. Inside the frame, the wall had taken to looking like it would, given permission, swing. It had the feel of a mouth being held shut by someone whispering “hush” and enjoying it too much.

Bluebottle had asked to come and then pretended he hadn’t. He arrived with a coil of rope that had known more calamities than religion and a tin of biscuits that he claimed was for morale. Clatter fetched up behind them, elbows ahead, eyes bright with the sort of hope that knows better and goes anyway. The woman in the dock-leaf skirt—name of Lettie Wedge, weather by appointment—had borrowed a broom for this expedition because some tools want the theatre of being themselves. She nodded to the keep as if to a person of rank she was not about to bow to. “It’s sore,” she said, which was a weather forecast good for masonry too. “It’s carrying pressure under the skin.”

“Like a boil,” Bluebottle said, gratified to be allowed to say boil with an audience.

“Like a confidence,” Lark countered, and set her satchel down. She took from it the bones she had rescued from the storyman’s bin, pale and unimpressed with the drama. She set them in a row on her coat and watched the wall watching her watch them, as if conscience were catching. She took out the glass bead with the bubble of Dudley sky, and the red tape, and the jet ring. She did not touch the jar yet. The bright inside had grown skittish since the demonstration; it had been asked to bark at a bell and it was still tasting dockyard on its tongue.

“What’s the plan, then?” Clatter asked, and then reddened, remembering she disliked the sort of plan that began as a boast. “Sorry. I meant: what can we carry?”

“Truth,” Lark said, because she was in a mood, and then gentled it. “We’re going to show the hill a thing it already knows. We’re going to splint. Hollows lie by filling the edges with nothing polite. We’ll give it bone to lean on. And we’ll teach the frame to be shy.”

Moss stationed himself exactly where he had to be to stop her from overreaching into wishful thinking. She took a bone in each hand and pressed them to the mortar at either side of the frame. The stone made that small surprised gasp it makes at the exact moment you put back what someone else has tidied away. Lark hummed the note with no pride in it. The bead warmed under her tongue where she had tucked it to keep her breath honest. Lettie stood with her broom’s straw end pressed against the ground and listened with her shoulder blades. Clatter held the rope like a rosary. Bluebottle faced outward, because if you place a Bluebottle well, he is a wall.

“Rock remembers nails,” Lark whispered. “Rock remembers trees that leaned against it when they were too tired to be upright straight away. Rock remembers fingers. It doesn’t care for gloves. It knows the difference between a grip and a press. We are making of now a then. We’re borrowing the hill’s stubbornness and lending it to this cut. Dear heart, take this hard and make it yours.”

The wind changed direction the way a person does when told a story that makes them put their head to the side to let it in. Moss had his eyes half-closed. His tail tapped Clatter’s shin in a rhythm that meant: this will come to something but not too fast. Lark placed the bones one by one, pressing them into the mortar with the heel of her hand, not fussing when the hill rejected two and took four. The red tape looped around the frame like a patient teacher. It brightened when it touched iron, then dulled, like a stern look that remembered mercy.

Lettie stepped closer and took a jar from her basket. The label said: Two Hours of Soft Rain; July, No Year. “Mind,” she said, “I’ve aught that will make it swell friendly, not angry. If you want swelling without shouting.”

“Bless you,” Lark said. “Give us the sort that persuades rather than insists.”

Lettie unscrewed the lid and let the smell of summer roll around the keep’s ankles. The sanded iron beneath the cream paint tasted it and flinched. The frame did a delicate shiver. Mrs. Harrow’s plaque rattled as if someone had rung it with one fingernail. Bluebottle didn’t grin, but his moustache wanted to.

Lark slid the jet ring over the bottom right corner of the frame, where making becomes most dangerous because it starts thinking it chose itself. She breathed the three names she had taught the weir—the town that sang after its throat had been cut; the saucepan man; her own—and felt the shape of the hill accept the weight of them like a hand taking bread. She tapped the bead against one of the bones, and the bead gave a little rain. The wall drank and softened where it should, not where it shouldn’t. The splint held.

Down slope, voices carried like litter. Lark recognized the sound of organized concern. Mrs. Harrow was arriving with a half-circle of people who made clipboards look like part of their biology. Grimble ghosted at the tail of them, not ghostly at all, ribbon dulled by weather, pride sharpened by the prospect of a spectacle.

“Time,” Bluebottle murmured without fuss.

“Then we’ll have done enough to make a nuisance of tidiness,” Lark said, and smoothed the red tape with her thumb one last time. She told it, under her breath and in the way she had learned you have to speak to things that have learned to be obedient to you: “You hold shy, you hold small. If a bell bullies, you don’t flinch. You remember how to be string. You don’t try to be rope. Rope shows off.”

Mrs. Harrow reached conversational distance already in mid-sentence, the way people do who have decided their voice is carriage and everyone else is road. “—a glorious example of community spirit,” she was telling the cluster of stakeholders she had invited to become a word. “Local input. We love local input. This town thrives on passion.”

Lark straightened like a person who had nothing in her hands. Lettie leaned on her broom and made it look like a posture rather than a tool. Clatter moved one half-step to the side and became unremarkable on purpose. Bluebottle stayed where he was and took on the shape of a man who has seen worse than minutes.

“Ms. Underbank,” Mrs. Harrow said, with a brightness you could have cooked with. “I was just telling our friends from the Hub that we are very open to—oh, how industrious of you.” Her eyes had the quick, precise motion of a seamstress’s scissors. She saw the bones. She saw the tape. She saw the jet ring and the fact of Lettie’s jar and she did the calculation for what audience she had. “So much ingenuity,” she added, a twist of spice on the compliment like a dare. “We do love the can-do.”

“You love the can, so long as you decide where the done sits,” Lark said, and smiled because you can say more with your lips than with your teeth. “Your frame is hurting the hill. It wants to be asked, not announced.”

“I am asking,” Mrs. Harrow said, and Lark admired the speed of her lie. “The very existence of this event is a compliment to the hill. We are giving it a voice.”

“You’re making it speak at you,” Lark said. “There’s a difference a mile wide. You opened something yesterday with a bell. It wasn’t ready.”

Mrs. Harrow held up her small book and her pen displayed itself as if it were responsible for civilization. “You have a very particular way of describing accidents,” she said. “We’ll have to file it under Colour. You are unaccredited.”

“Blessed be the day,” Lark said. “Accreditation is what men put on their coats when they want to be held responsible without being blamed.” She stroked the tape, once, under her breath. It had taken on a dull little want of its own: to be useful. That was a dangerous mood for tape. Tape that wants that badly starts thinking it can make a door polite by telling it a story. “You invited the hill to ring,” she said. “Let’s see what it thinks of your tone.”

Mrs. Harrow lifted her bell. It was not a bell you could buy in a market. It was the sort of bell that had been made by men who believed bells were a species you could breed for temperament. It had a lip that would bite if you touched it wrong. It had a throat like a purse: shut and holding something with the smugness of possession. She did not move her hand. The bell moved itself very slightly, as if the sound inside had learned to do so without permission.

The air in front of the frame tightened, then thinned, then tightened again, each time taking a hair more of the hill’s patience with it. A few of the stakeholders forgot to hold their faces and showed, briefly, their animal selves. Grimble’s eyes slid to Mrs. Harrow’s hands as he’d been asked. She led with her ring finger when she lied, he saw, a tiny flourish no one would think sign language if they weren’t looking for grammar in vanity. He felt a lonely pride in having noticed. He also felt the bell’s sound lubricating the edges of his own flaws in a way that made him want to be clever at the expense of the person nearest him. He put his teeth in his tongue and swallowed.

Lark took out the jar and held it like you hold a lanthorn when you don’t trust the night to only be night. The bright inside was already craning toward the bell like a small dog who has seen a cat with an attitude. “Steady,” she told it, the same voice she used for Moss when swans looked at him too personally. “We aren’t doing a fight. We’re doing a flinch. Wait for the flinch.”

Mrs. Harrow rang the bell. The sound that came out wasn’t what you’d think of when you think of bells; it was the intake before a word said with authority, the air prepared to help a pronouncement across a room. The wall inside the frame made a shape of yes. It was so close to being open that the top layer of mortar forgot it was a past tense. The plaque trembled. The red tape browned with indignation and then remembered it was paid for. It held. The bones hummed. The jet ring went cold.

Lark lifted the jar. The bright flared its little heart out and showed the bell a day it had never seen and did not know how to answer: washing hung across a ginnel; a child making a crown out of weeds and sincerity; a woman mending a shirt by lamplight and swearing at a politician she’d never meet. The bell had been bred for ceremony. It had not been taught laundry. It choked. The sound fell on itself and made a mess.

Mrs. Harrow did not flinch, which made Lark more respectful of her and more worried. She held the bell nearer the frame as if to say: you will, you will, you will. The wall bored its eyes into the iron with the gaze of rock that had had enough. The hill took a breath down in its dark. Lark felt the movement under her boots the way you feel a person near you making up their mind.

Lettie took the lid off another weather and let out an hour of bright cold that had been stored from a February when people had learned to skate their worries into something like grace. The air sharpened around the bell. It did not ring better for it. It cracked, very delicately, where the lip had been told it needed no one. Mrs. Harrow’s pupils nicked in her eyes. Her mouth did that small thing mouths do when they have one word they will not let out in public.

The wall retreated from the frame by a breadth of breath. The door that had wanted to be said instead was scolded by being seen. Lark relaxed a piece of her spine she had held in her fist. Moss wagged, one beat. Bluebottle let one lung decide to behave again. Clatter rocked forward and back on his heels and tried to look like the wind had done it all.

The plaque gave up, finally, and dropped off the frame into the frost. The stakeholders half-laughed because the universe had given them a cue and they knew to take it. Mrs. Harrow bent to retrieve the plaque and her glove touched the ground. The hessian beneath the paint had a word for her—that good Black Country word which serves as both insult and irritant—and it clung. She straightened with the look of a person who has been touched against her will by the material world. For one perfect, clean second she showed who she was to herself: a woman who would rather defeat puddles than get her shoes ready for them.

“You have wasted an opportunity,” she said to Lark, quietly enough that the stakeholders couldn’t quote exactly and loudly enough that they could breed it into a rumour of their own favours. “You could have joined us. You could have guaranteed a legacy. Instead you have chosen to be cute.”

“Cute is a hole where a tooth used to be,” Lark said, soft too. “Don’t call me what you call a bypass. You tried to make the hill clap for you. It has hands older than your bell. Be glad we only made it embarrassed.”

They stood that way a moment, two women of an age with a town between them that would outlast them both. Harrow was first to look past, and in that glance Lark saw how the next hour would go: a consultation with a backer in a coat that would not dare lint; a neat lie about health and safety; an email with attachments. The bell went into Mrs. Harrow’s bag with the discretion of a secret that knows its day will come back round.

“Fetch your paperwork,” Lark called cheerfully after her as she withdrew, because bidders hate it when you remember their bureaucracy. “Make sure it’s on recycled. Your Hub will enjoy the self-congratulation.”

Grimble slept three expressions in the space between Mrs. Harrow’s shoulder blades and the curve of the path. He lingered long enough to put his hands in his pockets and make a show of considering which way his conscience might fancy a stroll. Then he slouched over to Lark, because loyalty is a habit as much as a virtue and he had learned some habits simply to see if he could keep them.

“You made her bell swallow its own spit,” he marveled, awe and envy tripping over each other. “You’ll get smote for that when her God’s looking. She won’t use a God with a beard, mind. She’s got the one that comes in a box marked ‘ethics’ with a window so you can see the certificate.”

“You watched her hands?” Lark asked. “You saw what I asked you to?”

“Ring finger for lying,” he confirmed. “Thumb for want. She touches the base of the bell with the pad of her thumb when she longs, and it isn’t for this hill. She’s got taller hills in her mouth. She wants the word empire but she knows how to spell network.”

“Backer?” Lark said, because if you do not ask the questions boys like Grimble are dying to answer, they burst and then call it your fault.

“A Mr. Paxton,” Grimble said, relishing it. “That’s the name he carries in this pocket. In the other he keeps something sleeker, for when London calls him to its lap. He shook with three men near the bandstand last night, straight after they’d all had very serious coffee. He likes the word stakeholders because it lets him think he is the stake and you are the holder.”

“Stake’s a word with too much meat on it for the likes of him,” Bluebottle grunted. “He’s a skewer. Don’t dignify.”

“Skewers snap,” Lettie observed, tying the jars back in their woollen sleeves. “Let him skewer a fog and see if it fattens him.”

“What happened yesterday?” Clatter blurted, unable to save it for later. “At the demonstration.” He flushed, looking at Lark’s face for permission to ask her to tell a story back at herself.

“It rang,” Lark said, and measured out the telling like treacle, enough to sweeten, not enough to stick. “She made the air agree with her. The hill was too polite to refuse with an audience. A crack did what cracks do. It tried on the word door. We made of that notion a hat that didn’t suit it. It fell off. Something reached in—”

“The glove?” Grimble breathed, feeding on drama as eels do on light in deep water.

“The glove,” Lark said. “It didn’t touch. It didn’t need to. It was shopping for latches. We told it that downstairs isn’t for the uncurious. It doesn’t know that yet. It will learn. But Mrs. Harrow will try again because she’s not wrong when she says she’s preventing accidents, she’s just wrong about who’s going to be injured.”

“There’s talk,” Bluebottle said, “that she’s got Council lingo behind her now. Words like ringfence and oversight. Words that make decent folk humble by boring them.”

“Then we make better words,” Lark said. “You can out-stare a dullness with a good joke if you mind the edges.”

They went down by the path that makes everyone’s knees argue with their spirit. Dudley spread under them with its usual combination of brick and carrying-on. The museum sent up its familiar sigh and the canal wore its collar of light. Lark had in her pocket the bone from the boy, and the one from the bin, and another she had found under the keep where pigeons keep their intrigues. She could feel them fitting together in a shape they wanted to be asked to make. She would ask later, when there was no bell watching.

They turned off at the willow with opinions and went to see the grandmother on Tipton Road whose kettle needed forgiving. Lark had given her the half-remembered tin; the woman had given back bread that had taught itself to be braver than flour. She touched the kettle now, as if hello had heat in it. “It’s better,” the woman said, and did not want to say thank you in case it gave the world ideas. “It remembers steam.”

“That’s all any of us is doing,” Lark said, because if you don’t grant yourself grace you won’t be able to spend it on anyone else. “We remember steam.”

Back under, the lower ways had heard about bells and took to humming like men after the pub when a football song is being badly attempted for the love of it. They sat, Lark and Moss and Bluebottle and Lettie, and let their bones tell their nerves it wasn’t yet time to run. Clatter took it upon himself to make tea and did so with the careful outrage of a person who knows you should warm the pot and cannot believe that anyone must be reminded. The kettle sighed in gratitude for being asked to do what it had been made for.

“Tomorrow,” Bluebottle said, because someone always has to say it, “they’ll have men here with measurements. They’ll bring their hum with them. They’ll say it’s for mapping. They’ll stand where we stand and then tell us they haven’t been here because it wasn’t on their paper.”

“Lettie, love,” Lark said, leaning her head against the chalk and feeling the hill’s pulse slow. “Can you make me a bottle of weather that does this—” she gestured at the rock with her hand, not really knowing how to translate—“that makes a person too honest to justify themselves?”

“I can make nasty weather that strips politeness,” Lettie said. “I can’t make God. But I’ve a jar of November light that shows up dust and men’s bad shaving. And I’ve got leftover Whit Sunday that makes old people say what they really think about shoes.”

“I’ll take both,” Lark said. “We’ll need them. And I want fog. Blue, I’ll need your missus, the one you married by accident.”

Bluebottle’s ears pinked in the way of men who have gotten away with their lives by being kind and don’t want to be praised for it. “She won’t come if she’s in a mood,” he said. “But I can go to the edge and tell her a version of the truth that she likes. Wales forgave me in the end. It always does. It can’t help liking a man who apologizes with soup.”

“We’re going to muffle a bell,” Lark said. “We’re going to show a hill a joke it can’t resist. We’re going to make a frame blush. And we’re going to see what Mr. Paxton has for breakfast and whether he admits it.”

“Money,” Grimble put in from the doorway, because he is a creature born to stand where thresholds misbehave. “He eats money and says the word protein to confuse God.” He hesitated, one foot in, one foot making a case for rudeness. “Underbank,” he added, unusual, the syllables neat for the respect of them. “That boy. Red cap. He asked after you. He says his Mam says if anyone polite knocks it’ll be the sort of person who takes the carpet. You said you’d bring his sister a noise that laughs.”

Lark tabbed her memory like a ledger. “I did,” she said, remembering the button and the cardigan and the baby who liked mint. “Bring him, if you can do it without collecting a social worker on your coattails. Bring him round the back of the big Tesco where the wall tastes like last year’s bananas. We’ll give the baby something that will keep her laughing all winter and annoy the neighbours into righteousness.”

Grimble warmed like a man allowed to be the courier he pretended in front of the mirror he didn’t own. He looked at the jar on the shelf and at the bones on the cloth and at the ring of jet left winking its little black joke. “You like your trinkets,” he said, trying to make it superior. “I like your tricks better when I can’t hold them.”

“They’re not tricks,” Lark said, weary of the word because it makes of craft a lie. “They’re the small mechanics of mercy. Go on. Go find the lad. Tell his Mam my manners are worse than hers says.”

He went, because she’d given him the dignity of an errand and because he loved children in a way he could not afford to admit to himself. He went passing his own reflection in puddles and practicing a face for the Mam that would get him not invited in but not prevented from standing on the step. He went rolling a ribbon between his fingers and telling lies to himself about how someone had given it to him and wanted him to wear it for luck. Above, the castle sulked itself into a sort of stupid peace. Below, the chalk learned another line of their peculiar hymn.

The boy and his baby sister came at dusk, which in the lower ways is whenever the lamps decide to agree. He had the hat again and a look he had not yet grown into—something like a responsibility he had found on a wall and decided to try on. The baby laughed at Moss’s tail and tried to bite it twice. Moss submitted to both attempts with the composure of a philanthropist.

“Right,” Lark said, settling the baby on her knee and letting little fingers discover the space between seam and skin. “What we have here is a jar of left-behind joke. The sort you laugh at on the bus and then go to tell someone and lose a word and laugh anyway. You can have a thimbleful. That’ll keep her in chuckles when the boiler makes a noise at night.”

The baby took the air from the jar like a cheeky thief and did a giggle that sounded like a spoon finding a clean second at the bottom of a cup. The boy flushed with relief and then embarrassed himself by wiping his eye with the back of his hand in a way he hadn’t planned. “Ta,” he said, too formal to be safe with the softness it wanted to carry. “Mam says she doesn’t trust women in boots. Says they think they’re better than the road.”

“Tell your Mam I am noisier than the road,” Lark said. “And less even. Tell her she’s right.” She handed him a small square of card with nothing printed on it. “When the men with the boards come and ask your Mam to sign for her safety, make them write down on their paper exactly what they’re offering to protect and exactly what they’re not. Don’t let them write ‘community.’ Make them write ‘Mrs. Jones’s step.’ They hate particulars. Particulars make them pay out.”

He took the card with the gravity children have when they understand that a thing is worth more than its look. He looked at Bluebottle and Lettie and decided to trust them because they had eyes like people who had looked at a fire and taken the right pots off. He looked at Grimble like a boy looks at a bad idea that can be good if you hold its hand tight across the road.

That night, the damp found the chalk and sat down on it with the sorrow of a person who has to carry an anvil up three flights. The lower ways swelled with the sort of comfort that is mostly resignation. Lark put her tools away and set the bones on the shelf where the jar had taught itself not to seethe. She wrote Mr. Paxton on a bit of paper and then crossed it out and wrote Mr. Skewer. She wrote Mrs. Harrow and then a list: ring finger; thumb; bell; glove; door; hill; debt. She struck through debt and wrote owing because debt belongs to bankers and owing belongs to conversations.

She slept, badly but with commitment. If you only do one thing badly a day, make it sleep; then at least you can say you achieved it. She dreamed of a bell with moss growing on it, which is a thing bells hate, which is why it was satisfying. She dreamed of saucepans hanging from rafters in the dark, each one catching a word that would otherwise have fallen and broken. She dreamed of her mother tapping her between the eyes and saying: that bit lies, mind.

Morning, when it came, arrived like someone had opened a drawer full of knives and light. The town looked like it had been told to stand straight. Men with vests and clipboards took their measurements with kindness like a hammer. Mrs. Harrow stood near the frame and did not touch it, which in her case was restraint. Mr. Paxton had provided himself with a scarf that did not actually touch his neck because his skin did not like the democracy of wool. He shook hands profitably and said the word asset once too often in the hearing of a person who had worked a lathe and the lathe’s ghost. Grimble took notes on the inside of his head and made little marks on his skin with a pencil under his sleeve where the ink wouldn’t show to anyone he couldn’t fight off. Lark watched, then looked away, then watched again, because watching is both sport and duty.

She went to the foundry that wasn’t anymore, the one that hides now as a unit with roller shutters and a sad ambition to be storage. She stood by the old drain where iron used to run out and the ground had learned to be slag. She reached down and took a handful of old heat that had forgotten it had been dangerous. It came up black and soft and mild in her palm like bread that had lost the idea of yeast. “Sir,” she said to the ghost of the man who’d made saucepans with hands that had known sharper metal, “lend us your hush. We need to quiet a bell that wants to be important.” The hush warmed obediently, because men like him cannot refuse a woman who asks for quiet with work in her hands.

She took the hush to the hill. She took Lettie’s November light. She took the fog that Bluebottle had persuaded with a limerick and a promise to go back to Wales with flowers. She took the red tape and the bones and the bead and the kettle because the kettle liked to be included. She took Clatter’s elbows and Moss’s certainty. She took Grimble because sometimes you make yourself safer by taking the thing that will tell the tale.

Mrs. Harrow looked up as they came like a person who has heard of climate arriving and wants to prepare a paragraph for it. Mr. Paxton pointed with an entire hand at the frame and did a sentence about possibilities that sounded like a grant application. Lark smiled and let him spend himself. She knelt and pressed the hush beneath the lip of the frame where sound would have to crawl over it to be important. She smeared a thin black line with her thumb and did not mind when her skin took the stain; her hand had had worse. She let the fog gather round the keep’s ankles and taught it how to be manners. Lettie unscrewed November and the light told the truth about dust. The bell glimmered like a person whose wig is sliding.

“Stakeholders,” Mr. Paxton said, his voice not quite mating with the wind, “we are on the cusp of something truly—”

“Messy,” Lark said, and then smiled to take the thread out of the spleen. “Proceed.”

Mrs. Harrow lifted the bell and rang. The sound came and met hush. It did not die. It bent. It learned curve. It could not stop itself. Bells like straight lines. The fog laid a hand on it, the old Anglo-Welsh kindness that says, sit down and eat first. The November light showed the cracks and the clean and the places where polite had already got its fingernails in. The red tape held its temper. The bones took up the wall’s weight as if it had been their job all along and not a promotion.

The hill, amused finally, did what hills do when they are forced into narrative they find beneath them. It shifted its weight from one foot to the other and shook off a frame like a dog who has had enough of a ribbon. The iron creaked, and the cream paint made a small ugly noise, and the plaque decided it missed the frost. The bell gave a cross between a cough and a curse. Mrs. Harrow’s mouth made a line that could have cut paper. Mr. Paxton said, “Ah,” which is what men say when their plan meets the person who lives where they are planning.

“Let me be clear,” Mrs. Harrow said, refusing to lose, because she lived on a diet of refusal. “No one wishes to harm the hill. We are warding against accidents. The lower ways are—”

“Alive,” Lark said, because if you don’t say it sometimes no one will remember the word. “Indelicate. Ungoverned. They do not belong to you.”

“They do not belong to you,” Mrs. Harrow returned, pouncing on the pronoun like a cat on something that had moved without leave.

“They belong to themselves,” Lark said. “And to people who listen louder than they impose. And to women who can mind a kettle and a story and keep them from boiling over. If you want to help, put a bench up here without a plaque on it. Make it nice to sit and love Dudley without paying someone for the privilege.”

There was laughter at that—real, not purchased—and Mrs. Harrow could feel it begin to write itself on her in the way that laughter does when it is benign and numerous. She set the bell on the table very carefully and put the glove flat as a threat over its mouth. “We are making an inventory,” she said, addressing the people, not the hill; she had learned the hill would not grant her the pretence of being an audience. “What we cannot measure we cannot mend.”

Lark put the kettle on the frame where it could remember heat in the iron and where the iron could remember being leaf. “And what you cannot admire you will ruin,” she said. “Make sure your book has a column for that.”

Afterwards, in the pub that liked them and which they tolerated because it kept out men with neat accusations in their pockets, they sat with their feet near the fire and let their eyes be less busy. Lettie mended the fringe on her broom. Bluebottle distributed the biscuits he had bought for morale and had saved from men with hands called Stakeholders. Grimble performed for Moss, because Moss is an audience that agrees even when he doesn’t. Clatter asked three good questions and one poor one and learned something small and real from each.

“Do you think we’ve won?” he asked last, because the poor question wants asking too.

“Win is a short word for a short thought,” Lark said, and kissed the rim of her mug because you must bless the implements that bring you your reason. “We’ve taught the hill to take longer to say yes. That will do for a bit. We’ve taught a bell to have a sulk. That will do for a bit. We’ve shown a frame its place. That will do for a bit. We’ve not yet had Mrs. Harrow show us her sharp. That will not do. But we will do. We live near iron. We can stand.”

Grimble watched her with a concentration he usually saved for pockets. He reached—awkwardly, because his fingers haven’t learned how to behave with tenderness—and put the ribbon he had been wearing onto the table. It lay there like a confession. “I nearly told her something,” he admitted, words like coins he wasn’t sure he was allowed to spend. “She asked about the lower way door. I had the shape of an answer in my mouth. I spit it away. It hurt.”

“Good,” Bluebottle said. “Saying no should hurt. Otherwise you’re probably just being fashionable.”

“Fashionable no is worse than fashionable yes,” Lettie observed. “At least yes keeps people warm sometimes.”

They drank to that, not because it was clever but because it was the right-sized truth for the room. Outside, the frost rehearsed itself for the second half. Above, the castle found a position it could hold. Below, the chalk remembered another line of the hymn and tried it on for size. The jar on the shelf thought about being light and decided to be useful instead. The kettle enjoyed being metal. Moss dreamed that he had caught a swan’s opinion and brought it back unbruised, and that Lark had given him sausage for it and said he had done clever with kindness.

Before bed, Lark went to the ledge and counted her bits. It is not the counting that matters. It is the touch. She put the bones together and they made a shape like a small ladder, the sort you use for repairs no one sees you making. She smiled without wanting to and put the ladder back, because you must not spend a thing just because it pleases you to own it. She pressed her palms flat on the chalk and said the names of the hill again, and then, because she is not above being sentimental in private, the names of the people she had stood with. The rock warmed under her, not because it loves her, but because it is good rock.

In her sleep, the glove went looking for a different latch and found none that had been made for it. The bell sulked and polished itself. Mr. Paxton drafted a document that called puddles hazards and said nothing at all about weather. Mrs. Harrow dreamed she had to wash her hands forever and could never get the dust off, which means she is a person with a conscience and not just an ambition, which means she can be negotiated with at the cost of someone's comfort. The boy gave the card to his Mam and she used it to wedge a window open at night so the baby could breathe. Lettie woke once to check the jars and to shush a bottle of hail that had got ideas. Bluebottle’s damp wife rolled over him and made his hair into a map. Grimble lay awake and looked at a bit of ceiling he could not afford to own and thought about not telling, and the not telling glowed like a tiny stove.

Morning came in with yesterday’s coat on and an attempt at coffee. Lark got up and stretched until her back said yes again. Moss yawned with rude sincerity. They had a market to haunt, a bell to keep honest, a hill to flatter with jokes, and a new word to teach to men who like to own them. The new word was ours. It would do for a bit. It was not owned and it did not need laminating. It tasted good when you said it with bread in your mouth. It got crumbs on Mrs. Harrow’s brochure. It made Mr. Paxton’s scarf itch. It made the castle lower its chins and not mind the frost.

She took her satchel and her bits, and the kettle that had forgiven itself, and the jar that had decided to be usefulness shaped like light, and the ladder of bones. She whistled once for Moss. The lower ways lent them the sound they wanted to be. Above ground, Dudley put its boots on and argued with itself about which way to walk. It is a good town for arguing. It is a good town for mending what its own mouth breaks. Lark stepped into it. The day let her. She was sometimes unaccredited. She was often enough. She would be again.Chapter 7

Morning sulked at the mouth of the tunnel with a grey that couldn’t find its shoes. It loitered instead, blew its breath in, and made a palaver of being day. Lark felt it arrive in her knees first and then in the bit of her back that always thought first of kettles. Moss woke with a yawn that tried on three sizes and settled for enormous. Bluebottle had left bread wrapped in cloth and a note in his careful printing that said: Hush wants company; use sparingly; the fog’s not over her sulk. Lettie’s broom leaned in the corner like a person pretending not to eavesdrop. The jar on the ledge had recovered its temper and glowed like a small, sulking saint. Lark’s hands went to her things with their usual liturgy—red tape, jet ring, bead, bones—and she felt the rightness of the counts line up in her head the way a good song does when the harmonies decide to be friends.

She had not finished her tea when the lower way did that throat-clear it does for messages. The stones around the curve clicked at a register that asks you to come closer without telling the people in the room you’re leaving. Lark put her mug where the warmth would not die alone and went to the bend with Moss in lockstep. The chalk there had always been a gossip; today it told her, in the voice of someone trying to be calm while their house fills with water, that a school up by Wrens Nest had a sink that had reconsidered the direction of flow. Time, said the chalk, had got itself in the pipe, and the pipe, being a pipe and not a philosopher, had panicked and decided to feed the wrong end of day to children.

They went quick, a small procession that no one above ground would own—dog, pixie, the echo of a kettle like a warming thought. The school was one of those brick boxes that had grown up believing in itself in 1903 and never stopped. The caretaker had a face like a busted paving slab and the kindest eyes; he held the side door open with a mop bucket and looked relieved to have been sent a person to whom explaining would not be an insult. “It’s in 3B,” he said, voice a whisper because children were learning and he didn’t want to set a precedent. “They were washing paint out of brushes and then—” He made a gesture that managed flood and confusion and the pity he felt for eleven-year-olds when the world was rude to them.

In 3B a teacher with hair that had been neat at eight and had decided to be brave by nine stood with her hand on a tap she was refusing to turn. The sink was full of day. It had gathered itself there like coloured water, and it was trying to leave up, not down. The surface of it had that skim milk look ordinary time gets when it is tired; this had a sheen like someone had added oil of history and whisked. Two children sat near it with the expressions children make when they are about to become either brave or naughty. Lark flicked her eyes at the no-nonsense poster that read: we are kind; we are curious; we wash our hands. The order of it made her want to laugh and then put her head down and be good.

“Right,” she said, and the teacher exhaled like she knew the word meant someone would decide to be outcome. “It’s had a minute stuck. Someone left a story in a pot; it’s crawled down the drain and sulked there, and the sink thinks the minute is a plug. Moss, love, you stay there.” Moss planted himself in the doorway as if the hall were his beat. Lark took the bones from her pocket and made of them a thin ladder across the lip of the sink. The bones respected school. They sat with the obedience of children afraid of disappointing a caretaker.

Lark set the glass bead against the lowest rung and whispered at the minute in the only tone minutes understand: let go, duck, it’s time. She hummed a note that had mended five kettles and one aunt. The ladder quivered like a new tooth. Time did the thing it does when it is invited nicely and seen doing it. It climbed out of the sink, sheepish, the way men do when they have mistaken the ladies’ for the gents and pretended they meant it. It ran down the bones and sat in the bead a moment, and the bead held it like a godparent who will give it back after cake. The water remembered to be water; it went the way pipes dream of going in sleep. A child hiccuped relief and the teacher made the face of someone deciding not to cry where it might encourage chaos.

“Thank you,” the caretaker said, and the words fogged up his spectacles in a way that meant he had meant them at the boiler. “What do we owe you?”

“Glue your chairs,” Lark said, because if you don’t ask for something small you’re boring. “Kids will fidget and trip and bruise their knees in a way they will call character in thirty years and regret in thirty-five. Glue the chairs to a better idea of staying put. And keep your story pots on the sunny windowsill; don’t let them wash in sinks that want to be drains.”

On the way out, the boy in the red cap appeared as if he had been there since term began and this was his school whether the roll called his name or not. He had learned in the last day how to hold a thing without showing he was holding it; in his pocket Lark could see the corner of her blank card like a promise he had not broken. “Mam says you never came to our step,” he announced, and then kept himself from adding the rest which would have been something like: she said you’d forget and I told her you wouldn’t.

“I went to a hill and told it a joke,” Lark said. “It laughed along the wrong side and shook off a frame. Forgive me. I like your hat.” He nodded in that awkward courtesy boys perform for women they have decided to trust and then ran away not because he was scared but because running is what boys do to thank the world when they do not have money. Moss let him pat his head with the insouciance of a prince tolerating a subject with good hands.

When they turned the corner toward the car park, a sheet of bright inserted itself between a tree and a railing and pretended to be nothing. Lark felt her shoulder tell her that light was being rude. She flipped the red tape, made it plume like a ribbon in wind, and caught the bright with a flick. It tried to leak smug anyway; she stuffed it in the jar with the other and marked the lid with her nail—the slightest scratch which meant: this one thinks it’s important; remind it to be kind. Her fingers smelled beeswax after and she wiped them hard on her coat. The glove had been near. She tasted bees in the word and pitied them.

Back under, they found Bluebottle measuring air with a yard of string the colour of old vinegar. He had that look he got when someone had said the word consultation near his back. “They’ve posted a notice on the railings,” he said, and his moustache signalled its mood with a comb he did not have. “Stakeholder walk-through of the lower ways. Public engagement. Appropriate footwear. Volunteers for stewardship, apply within. They’ve printed a map with a dotted line where no dotted line deserves to live.”

Lettie tapped the broom handle against the chalk in four places without making contact, listening with her knuckles to the way sound told her things it wouldn’t tell a person who looked at it head-on. “They’ve got a man with a laser,” she said, the contempt she saved for toys that thought they were tools making a little steam. “He shines it and feels better. He will diverge from his own line when the fog puts her hands on his face, and he won’t notice he’s turned. I can get her to come if Blue is willing to be damp in a way that compliments.”

“Always willing to be damp,” Bluebottle said. “Mostly already am.” He put the string away as if putting away his temper. “There’s more. Mr. Paxton has hired the museum for Tuesday. A gala, they say, as if you can put frosting on a pit. Mrs. Harrow wants to show off certificates. Grimble says there’ll be cake and speeches and four men called partner and one woman called operations. The words synergy and pipeline will be used, and not to mean any of the useful things.”

“Do we have to wear anything?” Lark asked, and for a moment the temptation to wear something with mud on it simply to make the marble floors nervous took up residence behind her left ear. “If I turn up in boots they’ll call it a protest. If I turn up in a dress they’ll call it a concession. If I turn up at all they’ll call security.”

“They’ve sent you an invitation,” Grimble’s voice announced, mostly mouth, a little pride, from the upper step he had learned to hover on like a bad thought. He came down with a flourish obscured by the habit of being in the way. “Hand-delivered by a boy in a tie that was doing its brave best. It says Ms. Underbank, adviser, as if you had advised. It says networking after in the museum tearoom and live demonstrations of our new interpretive technologies. It says shoes must be clean.”

“Interpretive technology is a man with a tablet who points at a wall and hopes you’ll mistake his arm for understanding,” Lettie said. “Clean shoes is a slur disguised as laundry. Are we going?”

“We are,” Lark said, because if someone invites you to your own housewarming and tries to charge you for your teacups you go and bring a dog. “But first we go to the canal. There’s a pump test scheduled for four. They want to flush a lip to show the flow rates to a councillor who gets seasick in a bath. If they pull too hard the laugh we took off the weir will come back wrong. We’ll be catching it with buckets for a week.”

They went to Parkhead by the way that makes your lungs appreciate spitting. The pump men had fluorescent vests that had learned to boss the eye. One of them was kind to Moss without being patronizing, which put him toward the top of Lark’s list of people who could borrow a jar and return it clean. The pump itself had an air of someone starting a fight in a pub to get a hug. It throbbed congenially. Mrs. Harrow was there with a clipboard like a prop and Mr. Paxton with a scarf like treason against common sense. They had a little tent with sides that flapped and a banner with words too big for their trousers: Resilience Initiative; Water, Stories, Safety.

Mr. Paxton liked a greeting to feel like a contract and he liked to sign with other people’s pens. He reached out his entire hand and Lark shook it with the same grip she used on nettles. Mrs. Harrow did not proffer glove. Her eyes had the cold brightness of a person whose patience is her hobby. “We are not the enemy,” she said before anyone had accused her. “We are the ones keeping the story boys from drowning.”

“Tell the story boys to stand on the towpath,” Lark said. “Tell them to use their elbows judicious. Tell them to remember the canal is older than their chat.” She crouched and put a palm to the lip of the weir. It remembered the ring and it liked the memory like a scar you worry with your thumb and tell yourself you’re not proud of. The water had the excited shiver things get before they show off. Lark’s jar warmed against her side as if it had a dog in it. She glanced at Lettie and the woman gave her the tiniest nod, unscrewing a jar that had been labelled with the deceptive handwriting of weather: Cloud At Shoulder Height; Gentle. Bluebottle took up his position the way a boulder does when a river is feeling vengeful.

The pump began its strong hum. Water moved like a person pushed, and then like a person who has decided to discover if pushing might be a kindness. The lip tried on a laugh because habit is muscle; Lark slid the jet ring over it and it swallowed the joke, for now, with the good grace of a woman biting back the second word. Then something in the flow caught a snag of yesterday. A white sliver of bone, the sort men had trimmed off stories, sailed like a gull and lodged in the throat of the weir.

The water coughed. The crowd thought cheering might be appropriate and chose it like country chooses empire. Lark was already down on her belly with a wet sleeve, the bones from her pocket in a line, the red tape a question mark. The bone was smaller than the others and meaner; it had belonged to a story that had not wanted to be trimmed and had resented its end. She coaxed it with the bead against the stone, murmuring a version of love for things that don’t deserve it and do anyway. It came loose with a click like a tooth escaping a lie. She put it with the others on her coat and felt the small ladder in her mind protest at its own build; it preferred honesty. “Later,” she told it, because if you treat tools as confidants you still have to be in charge.

The pump men did their measurements. Mr. Paxton said numbers as if he had invented them. Mrs. Harrow patiented at the world. When it was done, the weir lay down like a dog told to try again. The water went about its business with the dignity of a thing that knows how to be useful. Nearby, a councillor praised resilience like a man discovering soup. Lark packed away the ring and the bead and the bone with the precise love she saved for close calls. She stood and let her eyes meet Mrs. Harrow’s because if you don’t look at people like that they think they won and you mind.

“You will get someone killed,” Mrs. Harrow said, as if they were sharing a shopping list. “Accidents will happen because you allow improvisation.”

“And you’ll get the wrong sort of silence,” Lark said, because some men dream of quiet and wake strangled by it. “Accidents are just the world bumping into itself and saying sorry. Your kind of tidy ends up apologizing to the wrong person. We’ll see you Tuesday. Bring your bell. Bring your certificates. Bring shoes that can stand to be laughed at.”

They prepared for Tuesday like people getting ready for weather. Lark took the bones and finished the ladder even though it hoarded its usefulness like a miser; she tied it with red tape and made it wear humility. Lettie filled three jars with that honest November that turns men’s mirrors into critics. Bluebottle polished his hat not because he wanted to look like a person with a hat to polish but because hats like to be told they are in charge of something. Grimble changed ribbon and combed his hair with his fingers and practiced looking uninterested in cake so that if given it he could enjoy betraying himself.

The museum had loaned itself to the gala the way a maiden aunt lends her best cups: gratefully, anxiously, with a list of things she will never say out loud and for which she requires you to read her mind. They had lit it too bright. The horse in the cart shed looked put out, which is an achievement in an animal carved of wood. The petrol station with the congealed sweets in the counter case had never been shinier; a child would know to trust it less. Lark came up by the side way under the tarry stink of old ropes and slipped into the main room with a nod to two ghosts who had taken a boredom shift on the upper balcony. The place was full of people who knew where the toilets were in town hall and liked being asked.

Mr. Paxton had a scarf that had learned nothing; Mrs. Harrow had a dress the colour of obedience; the bell sat on a table with a cloth that thought it wasn’t afraid of rings. They had made a display of plans and renderings, the sort of drawings that explain things to people who will never sit where the benches go. There was a map with a dotted line that walked boldly where no one had the right to step. Lark stood before it with the air of a woman who cannot read and is not embarrassed to say so. Lettie drifted, leaving weather in corners like calling cards. Bluebottle found the one man who could talk about rivets without trying to marry him; they made plans to argue later in great good humour. Grimble stolen a name badge that said Volunteer Liaison and was already directing three people to a door that did not exist.

“Ms. Underbank,” Mrs. Harrow said, arriving mid-sentence and letting the end of it dress Lark like a shawl she hadn’t asked for. “I’m delighted you could join us. This evening should be instructive.”

“Most evenings are, if you don’t go to bed angry,” Lark said. “What will you instruct us in? Project management?” She smiled like a biscuit that has discovered butter. “We brought our own curriculum. It involves kettles.”

They called time to gather and did the thing moderns do when they wish to pretend to be parsons: they stood at a lectern and invoked transformation. Mr. Paxton said all the words you would expect. He made community sound like a metaphor for an invoice. He used the word stewardship in a way that made Lark want to steal something in public and do a better job of keeping it. Mrs. Harrow spoke clearly and did not soften the vowels she thought beneath her. She did not ring the bell. She saved it for the moment she likes to make happen in rooms when she thinks rooms might be tired.

Lark waited through it like a person waiting for a kettle to boil properly, not that eager click when it lies. When Mrs. Harrow lifted the bell and the room leaned with all its hungry need for permission, Lark handed the bone ladder to Clatter without looking. He propped it under the table, where polish meets reticence. Lettie set November on the bell’s lip without lifting the lid. Bluebottle fussed with his hat directly under a spotlight until dust found itself too obvious. Grimble did the one beautiful thing he had been asked to do and reached out his clever, abominable hand when Mrs. Harrow wasn’t looking and touched the bell’s clapper with a kid glove he had nicked from a shop for rich men. Kid against lip. The glove told bell what it felt like to be held in the wrong way. The bell sulked and made a small, ugly burr.

Mrs. Harrow rang her bell and it made a noise like a promise three days late. The room paused, because rooms are sensitive, and then laughed, because laughter is jealous of ceremony and likes to knock it off its bike. Mrs. Harrow did not feed the laugh with a smile; she starved it with a paragraph about safety measures and access, and the laugh, not nourished, went looking for chips. In that gap that wasn’t silence, Lark stepped into hearing.

“Since we’re all stakeholders,” she said, not using a microphone because her voice had learned to catch in beams, “I’d like to hold a stake in the truth. Here are three particularities. One: the lower ways are not an absence, they are a presence you cannot own. Two: if you ring a bell at a hill it will remember a time it rang for plague and dislike your tone. Three: maps are not invitations. They are apologies.” She lifted the kettle from her bag and set it, quietly, on the table next to the bell. It steamed with the gentle authority of things doing their job. The steam fogged the bell’s lip. People in the first row smelled tea and remembered their hard grandparents and softened without meaning to.

Mr. Paxton moved as if to go to the bell and stopped because his scarf would not be seen near a domesticity. Mrs. Harrow moved as if to stand between Lark and the table and did not because she could not afford to look defensive before donors. Lark went on, because once you are honest you might as well be articulate. “We will not be consulted as a phrase and not a practice. We will not be explained to and then handed a plaque with our names spelled wrong. If you want stewardship, bring bread. If you want our patience, sit without your lists and listen until your shoes decide to disobey you.”

The room scattered itself into opinions. A woman near the door cried, because she had not meant to, and because her father had worked underground and she had learned to say it without meaning to live it and the kettle had made a liar of her without malice. A man with an expense account snorted and dressed the snort in humour and it fooled no one. Grimble flushed, because wanting to be on a side is an ache in a creature like him. Lettie smiled into her collar, because November had awakened on cue and was showing up the temples of men who had used too much good hair product as something that had failed to be weatherproof.

Mrs. Harrow lifted the bell again and this time the sound came in sideways. It did not fill the room. It found the corners and scolded them. It tried for the door. It rang up against the glass of the petrol station exhibit and hummed like a trapped wasp. Lark raised the jar of bright and let the trapped day flare just enough to distract the sound. It snapped at the wrong light and lost its way home. By the time Mrs. Harrow lowered the bell she had learned something too true to admit aloud: some rooms are not hers.

They broke afterward into biscuits and chat, as is the British way of disarming revolt. Mr. Paxton collected cards that he would throw away later and smiled like a man whose dog had embarrassed him at a show. Mrs. Harrow stood with her back to the bell and made a little wall of shoulders and personnel. Lark went to the back where the children’s exhibits lived and sat on the step near the mock-up of an old kitchen. She put her hand on the table where a pretend rag had been left for atmosphere; the wood remembered being used and rewarded her with the sort of warmth that bred competence. Moss came and lay his chin on her shoe and sighed as if she were a lake that had finally remembered to exist. The boy with the red cap had slipped in because children can teach themselves out of rooms adults deserve and he had the look of a person who had eavesdropped his way to wisdom. He sat straight-backed on a stool and looked at the bell as if it were an uncle who had not yet earned his tea.

“They came to our step,” he reported, in the voice a child uses when he has done something his mother would call clever. “Mam made them write ‘Mrs. Jones’s step.’ The man wrote ‘curtilage’ and Mam laughed in his mouth. He drew a dotted line and she said it made her foot itch and to stop it. He did stop it. He did not like stopping it, but he did it. Mam says to tell you that saying particulars out loud made her remember her own name and it tastes better than the one on letters.”

“Good,” Lark said, and knew she could cry for that if she let herself. “Tell your Mam that the step is historic. Tell her any man with a map who says otherwise should be invited to stand on it and then told it is moving. He will go away thinking there is a sinkhole. It is not a sinkhole. It is respect. Keep your hat on. It makes sense of your face.”

When the donors and the councillors had gone, when the bell had been wiped and lidded and taken away like a misbehaving pudding, Mrs. Harrow found Lark once more in a corridor that smelled of oil and pretend bread. She did not have her gloves on. She had forgotten them on the table, which is the nearest thing to intimacy she had offered a person since Tuesday’s decision. “You will ruin this town for me,” she said, very low. “You will ruin my work.”

Lark stood with her hand on a model mangle and felt in her bones the forgiveness of that wheel. “I will ruin the bit where you get to pretend you can put it in a brochure and make the mud behave. The rest you cannot ruin if you try. Dudley has ruined itself and mended itself and will do both again long after your bell is in a box and my tape has dulled. Tell Mr. Paxton that the word he wants is then; he keeps saying future and the hill laughs at his mouth.”

Mrs. Harrow looked at the ceiling like a person willing it to be a sky she could write on. “I am from here,” she said abruptly. “I will like puddles when they stop lying about depth. When I was nine my brother went in one and did not come out for two minutes and the two minutes came out of me and I never got them back. That is why I like gloves. That is why I like certificates. That is why I do not like you. Do not prevail upon me to be patient with your improvisations. They frighten me, and I do not enjoy being frightened.”

Lark breathed in beeswax and remembered the glove at the crack and felt her own face do something she did not want witnesses for. “Then don’t come downstairs at night,” she said, very quietly. “Send for me. I will go. You stay where your lungs remember the alacrity of air. I cannot do anything with your bell, not truly; bells keep secrets with each other and there are more bells than me. But I can stop a map forgetting where water is ungoverned. Leave the lower ways alone. They make men into song or into silence. You are not ready to decide which.”

Mrs. Harrow’s mouth closed like a ledger with a finger still in it. She nodded once and picked up her gloves from the table like a woman who has remembered a child asleep under a coat and pretended it had been her plan all along. “Tuesday week,” she said, which is when people announce their next push. “We will have a vote. The Hub will be present. Mr. Paxton will bring a list. We will ring a bell in a room and ask it to be a law.”

“Bring your bell,” Lark said, and set the kettle on again because defiance and tea are the twin pillars upon which the Black Country built itself. “I will bring a ladder. We will see which sound the hill takes in. We will see who can hear what does not wish to be said. Bring your glove, Mrs. Harrow. There is coal under your fingernails and it bothers you. I can taste it.”

They left the museum at the sort of hour that kit-bags remember. The car park had emptied itself and the sky had consisted itself into a black that had had enough of metaphors. Moss trotted a little ahead so he could pretend the world happened because he reached it first. Grimble walked backwards for twenty feet to make the night applaud him and then tripped over an honesty plant and pretended he had meant to curtsy to the moon. Bluebottle hummed something that had learned its awkward from football and its tenderness from brass. Lettie let the broom ride her shoulder like a baton on a woman about to conduct a storm.

At the lower way entrance the air dropped two degrees and remembered past. Lark put the bones on the shelf with reverence and a warning. She took a jar labelled Whit Sunday and pressed it to her cheek because skin likes ritual too. The jar sighed. The chalk grumbled in pleasure. She sat with her back against good stone and her feet toward warmth. Moss flopped down with the confidence of animals who know they are forgiven by a species not worthy of them. Lark closed her eyes on the thought of a glove that is a fear and a bell that is a weapon and a hill that is a person you must charm and stood up again immediately because a trickle somewhere had forgotten the direction of gravity, and when gravity forgets, you fetch your ladder and your dog and you do your old town’s job.Chapter 9

The trickle had set its mind to the ceiling and nothing good ever comes of water deciding to climb. It had gathered courage in a seam and then rehearsed the old step of stalactites, and the chalk, affronted at being turned into a theater for a backwards river, clicked its teeth. Lark felt the complaint before she saw the glimmer, a shiver through the stone like a cat’s back under your hand. She took the bone ladder, the kettle, two jars—November light and Soft Rain, July, No Year—and whistled once without sound. Moss rose like he had never learned lying down.

They followed the wrong-water to a corridor that had never liked being straight. The ceiling showed a faint bruise where damp had decided to be direction. On the far side a glow pooled, not jar-bright, but the tired luminescence of a minute that wanted recognition and was trying to climb toward applause. Someone had been here with neatness. Lark sniffed and found beeswax under chalk, gloss tucked into rough. The glove had stroked this place and left behind the sermon of polish. Bluebottle’s string—he had taught the lower ways to accept it as a kind of vein—hung slack at the turn, and that slack had the nerve to look smug.

“Of course,” Lark said, under her breath to the corridor as if it had asked a question in class and wanted points for confidence. “If you invite a bell to a hill, the hill will invite itself to a bell. And water, being older than both, will go wherever applause is more likely.” Moss put one paw in a puddle that wasn’t there a moment ago and withdrew it, shaking his toes with the offended dignity of a pianist unable to find middle C.

At the bend, a ladder of iron spikes rose toward a hatch that did not know itself, planted a lifetime ago when some brave fool had decided to make the lower ways obedient. The hatch, which had been only a thought for years, had been coaxed hard into noun by someone with a gloved will. It had learned to be door. Above it, the wrong-water seeped and then trickled, and where it used to drip, it now reached. When gravity forgets itself, panic borrows its hat.

They were not alone. Voices came down as a rumor of caution wearing high-visibility vests. A head poked through the hatch with a torch clipped to his temple—laser man, Lettie had named the type. He had the blink of someone asking a machine to love him and receiving only data in return. On his back, a rucksack sat like shame. Behind him, grim and intent, Mrs. Harrow’s voice arrived first, doing that brisk kindness that is meant to make fear sit, stay. “Appropriate footwear,” she remarked to the dark, the way you say to a dog: shoes, now, sit.

Lark set the bone ladder against the wrong wall and let its own good sense find the true down. Bones are honest. They know what weight is for. The ladder quivered, then aligned itself with the way a body wants to fall when it’s tired. “Don’t come any farther,” Lark called, and pitched it to catch bureaucrat and bell alike. “You’ve turned the corridor into ambition. It’s a small space for that sort of thing.”

Mr. Paxton’s scarf appeared as if it were his chaperone. “We’re merely—” he began, and the lower ways took offense at merely. The hatch twitched. A rung shifted under the laser man’s boot. His temple light carved a bar across Moss’s face. Moss narrowed his eyes to a statement.

Bluebottle had followed with the sort of quiet a big man can give a delicate room. He made himself a wall below the hatch. “Would you like,” he asked the laser man, in the tone you reserve for a toddler holding a nail, “to be useful by not moving.”

The laser man froze with the relief of the properly instructed. Lark did not look up at Mrs. Harrow; she addressed the indignity, not its author. “You’re teaching lids to open,” she said to the hatch, “and you’ve got a fine idea of yourself, I can hear it. Just now, though, we’ve got a child’s minute stuck in a sink, and the hill still sulking from being made to perform in daylight, and a pump that thinks applause is a pressure curve. You’ll close now. You can learn to be adjective again.”

The hatch hesitated like a proud creature asked for a trick. Lark took the jar of Soft Rain and unscrewed it a breath. The sound of July shushed into the seam, and the iron remembered a day it had been left outdoors in childhood and hadn’t rusted as fast as it wanted. The wrong-water gave up pushing and remembered its old job: to fall. It did, and the relief in it made Bluebottle’s moustache lift. The bone ladder settled and Moss’s tail thumped Lark’s shin with the steady: now, now, now. Above, Mrs. Harrow did not descend. She had been a child who learned staircases by ear and could hear a sulk in treads.

“Withdraw,” Lark said, not to her but to the hatch itself. “Try being a rumor again. It’s a better life for you, here.” The iron pulled its shoulders in. The glove had left a polish that sulked at losing purchase. The chalk, gratified, refitted itself around the idea of closed like a careful seamstress.

Mrs. Harrow didn’t thank. That was not the currency she had brought. “We have a scheduled inspection at ten,” she announced, to the stone which is kind enough to carry meaning without reward. “Stakeholders will attend. The Council requests a plan.”

“The lower ways have a plan,” Lark said. “It’s called: be older than men. Your Council can borrow it if they promise to give it back.” She looked at Bluebottle, and he looked back with the weight of a man who can be relied on to be unmovable. “Fetch Clatter,” she said. “Fetch Lettie. Fetch your damp missus if she’s in a forgiving mood. If they’re going to walk, they’ll walk where the hill will tolerate the noise.”

By ten, the corridor had stopped pretending to be throat and gone back to being artery. Lettie came with her broom tucked into the promise of modesty, her jars clinking like well-behaved congregation. Clatter shone his elbows till they squeaked and showed up with a coil of rope he had stolen politely from a site that didn’t deserve it. Bluebottle’s wife—the fog, with her temper coiled up under civility—hung in the entrance like a thought you hope someone else will say. Grimble arrived late and tried for nonchalant, ribbon tamed for the hour, shoulders carrying a posture he’d borrowed from a man who knew what to do with it.

Mrs. Harrow had not come alone. A Council man in an anorak with a pocket full of compromise did that official smile that looks like he’s saving his nice one in case there is cake. Mr. Paxton brought two assistants who had learned how to nod themselves into a career. A woman with a first-aid kit and the face of someone who would go home and cry in the bath if today went the way of all spectacles stood near the back and measured everyone’s ankles for possible injuries. There were three men and two women with clipboards; there was the laser man, freshly grateful for being alive. There were two old boys Lark didn’t know by name but trusted by the cut of their boots; they’d worked down here when down here meant bread.

“Welcome,” Lark said, and meant it for the parts of the crowd that deserved it. “There are rules. We do not whistle. We do not ring bells. If someone says ‘left’ and it’s not me, you look at me before you oblige. If the floor feels like a sentence that hasn’t chosen its verb, you stand still until it does. Questions at the end. Accusations in the pub.”

Mrs. Harrow’s eyebrow filed that under insubordination. The Council man put too much pen in his pocket and nodded like a man learning a dance with three feet. “Proceed,” he said, and the lower ways tried not to laugh at the word. They moved out in twos because even tidy people know to trust Noah on this point. Moss took up the lead because he knows what corridors mean when they won’t say it.

At the first bend the air had a fossil in it. You could smell slate under chalk, something tidy and old interleaved with the mess. Lettie paused and set her fingers against the wall; she could feel the ridges inside like a record. “Bugs,” she said, mouth soft. “They’re close to the skin today.”

“Dudley bugs,” Bluebottle confirmed, reverent, because men with oil in their knuckles know the comfort of a fossil that looks like an eye. “They like listening to you talk; it makes them think rock is picking up again from where it left off.”

“On your left,” Lark warned, the phrase for nothing and everything. The corridor tightened: not physically, but in that way a room does when it remembers a fight. The laser man’s line did that nothing—cut through fog and made a neat bright which embarrassed itself at corners and tried not to show it. The fog wife, pleased to be considered a tool, breathed in the laser until it coughed politely and had to start itself anew.

They were halfway down a run where the world changes key when a boy’s laughter came back wrong. Lark’s neck commanded her attention to the edge of the party. Two students—Paxton had brought an intern with out-of-town shoes and a council officer’s teenager who had begged to see—had hung back to test the courage of their own names in acoustics. The intern had put his hand into a slice of light and found his watch telling him it was last Thursday; his face went pale with a sin he hadn’t committed. The council girl had stepped onto a floorboard that thought it was a sentence; it was not sure whether to verb or noun her.

Moss put his shoulder into Lark’s knee. Lark took the bone ladder from her bag with the ease of a mother finding a plaster in a coat that never runs out. She set it on the sentence-floor and the floor, grateful for grammar, decided on being. The girl stepped back, embarrassed and newly fond of floors. Lark pressed the bead to the intern’s wrist, and Thursday gave up and became today again without getting mean about it. Across from them one of the old boys muttered, “She does it like it’s knitting,” and the other said, “Aye,” which is all a county can ask of witness.

Harrow’s mouth made the line that meant: this, here, is my argument. Lark did not let her have the room’s attention for it. She put her hand flat to the wall and spoke to the bugs. “Listen, loves,” she said, kindly and not a bit less like an order. “We’ve brought people who’d like to keep you in rock and call it preservation. No one will take you to a mantel. At least not today. But you know the way the hill shifts. If the way under the Tesco starts dreaming of sky, you wake someone who loves kettles. Not the Hub. They’ll bring clipboards to a collie’s job.”

The wall warmed. The ridges under Lettie’s fingers hummed like a choir’s agreeable aunt. Across the party a Council woman with a secret trilobite tattoo under her sleeve pressed her mouth into the shape that says: I will become awkward in a meeting for you. Mr. Paxton adjusted his scarf and attempted amusement. His assistants attempted him. Mrs. Harrow said, “This is exactly why we need protocols.”

“This is exactly why you need manners,” Lark said, and smiled. “Stones like to be asked. Puddles like to be courted. You’ve come with a proposal and a bell. Try coming with bread.”

They stood a long minute beneath a curve that had been cut by men in hurry and reinforced later by men with less time but better sense. Bluebottle taught a pair of stakeholders how to listen with their heels. Lettie walked the edges and persuaded a draft to stop pointing where it shouldn’t. Grimble drifted, performing casual until someone said corridor and then he paid attention like a dog hearing the click of a lead. The fog wife idled by the laser man and stole his line so gently he felt complimented.

Up ahead, the way opened out into the chamber everyone had sworn didn’t exist, and which therefore held more truth than the rooms on maps. It was older than names. The roof domed not in architecture but in survival. In the center, half-swallowed by silt and the last century, sat a bell.

It was not like Mrs. Harrow’s creature with the lip that would bite you and a throat that had been taught to judge. This bell had not been bred. It had happened. Some blacksmith, tired and loved, had poured it in a rush when sound was needed more than finish. It had hung once somewhere that grass had known it and then been brought down when grass learned to forget. The surface bore the thumbprints of a man who had convinced bronze to be a throat. Moss, respectful as he is of anyone who knows dignity, stood and did not wag.

The Council man looked as if he had been handed responsibility and found it could sing. The intern forgot his watch. The old boys, very softly, named men who might have made this and whose names had no plaque. Mrs. Harrow’s eyes changed the way resident eyes do when a memory with no photographs walks into a room wearing a voice it always had. Mr. Paxton’s assistants looked for a power socket.

“Don’t ring it,” Lark said, before anyone’s hands could produce impulse. “Not at first. Tell it a joke. When it laughs, we’ll know how to say hello.”

Grimble beat everyone to it, which is why you bring a fool to church. He stepped up with his hat in his hand as if he had been raised properly, and he told the bell the lamest little truth he owned. “Once,” he said, standing quite still and putting all the noise out of his mouth that he could manage, “I took three sweets from a dish at a counter that said one each only and the woman behind the counter said, ‘You’re a lad who will never make a straight line, and that’s alright if your curves are useful.’” He swallowed the old panic at being seen and went on. “I didn’t know how to be curved then. I do, more. It’s nearly funny.”

The bell did not ring. It breathed. Sound, which has its own ancestry, rolled slow and generous along the chamber, woke dust with affection, stroked the trilobites into showing off. Mrs. Harrow, who doesn’t cry at a film, blinked like chalk had got in. The Council man forgot to take a note. Lark put the kettle beside the bell and the two of them had the sort of conversation metals have when they remember fire kindly.

“Right,” Lark said when the old breath had gone round twice and everyone had learned how to be this quiet. “Terms, then. You bring people down here, you come with someone who can listen. Two per ten with old boots. You walk where the bell agrees. You bring no maps that show dotted lines where none belong. You bring bread. You bring tea. You bring the word ours and mean it. Your bell,” and she nodded at Mrs. Harrow, “isn’t allowed to speak first.”

Mrs. Harrow’s jaw worked like a hand trying keys. Paxton opened his mouth and discovered he had brought the wrong teeth. The Council man looked at the bell like it was a vote that would be counted whether his lot wanted it to or not. The woman with the first-aid kit, brave and tired, said, “Bread I can do. I can bake nine loaves in a night if I think mothers are coming with children on their hips. The rest of it you’ll have to have your fights about. But I can bring bread.”

“Bless you,” Lark said, and meant it for more than bread. “We’ll show you where to put benches that make neighbors of knees and leave no plaque.”

A tremor lifted the edges of stones and set them down. It was not a threat. It was the hill resettling into a yes it had picked. Bluebottle looked at the roof with his mouth full of numbers and relaxed a sum. Lettie’s broom sighed. Moss leaned into Lark as if to keep her upright against the particular weight of relief. The bell made the sound bells make when their throat is stroked by air that isn’t trying to make a law: a hum that knows names it isn’t telling.

On the way out, the corridor remembered how to be mean and tried for it. Harrow, thinking too far ahead and looking at the next bend, put her toe on a patch of chalk that had gone glassy under worrying. Her ankle folded the way ankles do when they want to point out they have joints. She caught herself on the wall with a hand that had forgotten its glove. Her skin met stone. She did not flinch. The corridor, astonished, behaved.

Outside, the day had decided to be a day for shopping lists and small reconciliations. The notice on the railings about the walk-through hung by one cable and flapped a half-lie. The boy in the red hat sat on the wall as if gravity were his cousin and grinned at Moss as if dogs were wages you were proud to earn. “Mam says the man wrote down our step right,” he told Lark without preamble, because you don’t stand on ceremony when your house is full of wind. “She says he’s going to come and look at it and not measure it and she likes that. She says if they put a bench by the canal she’ll sit on it and stare down anyone who thinks sitting is an opinion.”

“Your Mam,” Lark said, “is the sort of woman who can teach benches their job.” She gave him a jar the size of a thought. Inside it was laughter from a Thursday during a wet market when someone had mispronounced a vegetable and no one had died. “For your sister,” she said, “when nights are too long. That kind of laugh doesn’t go off.”

He took it with a gravity older than the museum and tucked it into his pocket as if his ribs were a safe. “Grimble told me a joke,” he confided, proud of trusting a suspect. “It was rubbish. I laughed anyway. He looked like a dog who’d found a glove.”

Lark looked over the boy’s head. Grimble was pretending not to be near, which for Grimble meant hiding behind something with his shoulders visible. “He’s learning,” she said. “That counts.”

No one spoke of the glove that had touched the hatch, or the way the hatch had nearly decided it was a door with the right to interrupt breakfasts. Some things you don’t give a life by naming them where they can hear.

In the tunnels, the bell’s breath lingered. It settled into the chalk like oil into bread, and the trilobites at the edge of things showed themselves by laying a shiver under palms. Bluebottle wrote a list titled: benches, bread, rules we don’t write down, and then threw the list away and kept it in his mouth instead. Lettie put November back with a cluck and put out Whit Sunday to keep it from turning ladylike. Clatter polished the red tape with a clean rag and said nothing neurotic about it because even he could tell it had done enough.

Lark put the bones back on the ledge and they made the little shape they wanted to make without asking. It pleased her so much she had to pretend a cough and then she had to laugh at herself for the pretense. Moss slumped against her and melted into her shins like a poured dog. The kettle made its peace with being metal and promised a future with steam in it. Above, the museum was a boat full of earnest and ego and old oil, and the town around it told itself the day, the way it always had: badly and truthfully and out of order, which is the only way any of us learns the tune.

That evening, under the willow that had adopted a pipe and called it kin, Mrs. Harrow came down the steps like a woman teaching herself to do something she had sworn she would never do again. She had no bell. She had no gloves. Her hands were clean in the way hands are when they have actually done work and then been washed. She sat on a root that did not approve of her and didn’t try to charm it. “Tuesday week,” she said, voice stripped down to the plank. “We’ll hold the vote. I will lose it if I do not ring. If I ring, I will win wrong. Either way I will go home and hear my brother’s two minutes. I am telling you so that later, when you are angry and kind about me, you will add that to the arithmetic.”

“Thank you,” Lark said, because whatever else you owe an enemy, you owe them credit for exactness when they manage it. “If you ring, the hill will embarrass you. It will drop your plaque and it will let your laser walk into fog and it will choose a different corridor for the council’s feet than the one on your plan. If you do not ring, Mr. Paxton will write six emails and three of them will threaten budgets and one will patronize the memory of your grandmother’s apron. Choose the way you can live with the day after.”

“Do you ever get tired of improvisation?” Mrs. Harrow asked, with the fatigue of a woman who has ironed out so many decisions her shoulders keep square all on their own.

“Some days I want to sew a straight seam and never cut it,” Lark said. “Some days I want to laminate my own name. Then Moss brings me a smell with opinions and the kettle puts its lid on at the right minute and the hill allows me to call it love without laughing. On those days I cope. The rest I carry.”

Mrs. Harrow stood. The willow decided not to trip her. She looked at Moss, serious as a judge, and did not try to touch him; she had learned some dog. “Tell your Bluebottle to keep his children out of the way Tuesday,” she said. “Even good bells can break if a person is too in love with victory.”

“I’ll tell him,” Lark said. “Bring bread.”

“I’m not a baker,” Mrs. Harrow snapped, reflex more than insult.

“Then bring a bench,” Lark said, softer. “Sit on it. Let them see your knees aren’t exempt.”

The glove—this is to say, the fear that wears the glove and the glove that borrowed fear’s shape—stirred the air between them and found no latch open. Mrs. Harrow made a face that said she had heard it and was teaching herself to treat it as weather. She went away with her hair arguing with the wind and losing, which is the best thing hair can do in the company of necessary women.

In the night, the bell down in the chamber breathed itself to sleep. The bugs in the wall dreamed of shallow seas and the warm press of sun filtered through ages of silt. The lower ways kept their complicated promises. Lark wrote a short letter to no one and left it on the shelf for the air to read, because you must do these small hospitalities for the place that holds you or your luck goes thin. It said: lend me your ears tomorrow; I’ll return them cleaner. Moss snored into her ankle and kicked once at a swan only he could see. The kettle kept watch in the way good kettles do, one ear for boil and one for footsteps. Above, the town pressed itself flat into sleep and dreamed, briefly and brilliantly, of benches without plaques and puddles that told the truth about their depth. It was almost enough, and Lark allowed almost to be sufficient until morning tried on its shoes again.
