The first body lay where the river bullied the bank, where kudzu tangled the signposts and whispering stacked itself between the train cars that had been abandoned so long they were part of the landscape. Dawn hadn’t gotten its act together yet, just a wash of thin blue leaking from the lip of the sky. The men in canvas jackets were yawning around their coffee cups, steam rising—exhaust from tired lungs. Flashers clicked in yellow, pooling light on rocks and riprap and the slick slopes where runoff gathered secrets.

She saw the color before she saw the face.

Turquoise. Not hospital-blue, not the blotchy sky-blue that cheap denim fades into, not the watery color of a swim pool long after summer has left town. Turquoise, the way a stone looks on a woman’s throat when she doesn’t care who’s watching her; old mountains crushed to powder and sealed in resin.

“Detective,” someone said, moving their mouth around chewing gum. She didn’t look to see who. She already knew the way the vowels sounded when her name came off strangers: Dodge, like a thing thrown at you. She walked down the slope, her boots making a sound like rain on cardboard. She had to lean, catch herself on a root; the Tennessee had been eating away at the bank again, wild and patient, the way grief gnaws.

He lay with his head against the concrete step someone had poured and forgot, and it didn’t seem right, the way his neck couldn’t decide which way to become slack. His hair had taken the paint like a bird’s nest dipped in stormwater. Turquoise spread across his cheekbones and throat, across his chest in drips and with odd deliberation: places left bare like they were holding their breath. It shone when the light hit it. His eyes were open, and the whites were white, startling, not washed out by paint, so that he seemed to be witnessing his own painted body and could do nothing to argue. The paint had dried in beads along his lashes. No blood to speak of, no fight. The cold had done its job neat. He had been placed, not dropped. Whoever had done this had an aesthetic.

“Morning, Dodge,” said Quinn, coffee cup in both hands, a scarf wound to his chin. He had pale cereal eyes, spooned and forgetful. “We got the call at four eighteen. Jogger called it in. We got—well. You’ll see.”

“I’m seeing,” she said softly.

The jogger was standing near the cruiser, hugging himself like his upper arms had promised something and backed out. He’d talked to Patrol already. He would talk again. He would say that it had looked like a statue at first. He would say he had seen art museums in bigger cities and this had the same hush except for the river keep saying hey hey hey against the rocks. He would say he hadn’t thought to touch the boy. He had never seen that color on skin before.

Dodge knelt. Her knee hit frozen earth. It bit up through denim. She had done worse things with her knees. She had let them grind into gravel under the belly of a truck in Fallujah while she stuffed a torn-up tourniquet into a man’s thigh and said you’re okay you’re okay you’re okay, while the noon sun squatted like a jealous god. She didn’t want to think of that here, not with the smell of latex and river and cheap coffee. She breathed like an instrument being tuned. She looked for fingerprints in the paint, for brush marks, for the pressure of a hand that had pressed this man back to stillness. There were brush marks, yes, precise, as though whoever had painted him had paused and turned the brush in their fingers to make the edges clean. As though he had been painted for an audience. As though being dead was a medium.

“Don’t touch,” Quinn said reflexively. He knew she wouldn’t. She looked anyway.

An index card was tucked under the boy’s backside, as neat as a love note under a dorm pillow. Quinn had the sense to point with his eye rather than his hand. Dodge nodded. She put on her gloves. The paint didn’t smear when she nudged his hip enough to free the edge of the card. It had adhered. He was heavy with it. This is how paint works; it makes things heavier. Her father had painted houses until his lungs filled with grit. She knew the smell of thinner the way some people know the smell of a good red sauce, and this had that, plus something camphor-bright, almost clean.

The card read: HE SAID MAYBE.

Quinn said nothing, because they were new enough to each other that he still let her name the bones of things before he did. They had been thrown together three weeks ago with a pair of stupid smiles from higher-ups who liked the way their resumes matched like a bad blind date. You like guns? She likes guns. You like not sleeping? She likes not sleeping. You both look like you keep secrets like spare keys under your tongue.

“Who is he?” she asked the corpse, softly enough it might have been to herself. The wind answered. It kept worrying the weeds. The sun stuck one shoulder over the treeline and stopped there, cocky or shy, she couldn’t tell.

“Wallet says Daniel Payne,” Quinn said. “Twenty-one. Vandy student. Wallet was left. Cash gone. Or he didn’t have cash. Phone not present. No obvious contusions. We’ll know more once… you know.” He flicked his eyes at the ME van.

She waited for the memory. It arrived like a dog that doesn’t come when called but when it feels like it, damp and defiant. He said maybe. He. The killer—or the not-killer—needed there to be a he. The paint insisted on it, in the way it illumined places that young men show to each other in locker rooms, the way it made exposed skin into an exhibit. He said maybe, and the color was chosen to match the feeling of being told that you are almost good enough but not quite, that you are the backup dancer for your own life.

“Turquoise,” she said.

“Paint sample?” Quinn said, as though asking her to dance. “We’ll pull chips. See if there’s an identifiable brand. You think the paint’s meaningful or—”

She looked at him, not unkindly. “You think the paint isn’t meaningful?”

“I’m asking,” he said quickly. “I mean. Maybe it’s what was in the closet. Maybe his mom does shabby-chic.”

She looked at the way the paint had been applied to the wrists, like cuffs. The way the mouth was only half-coated, as if the brush had hesitated where lips become impossibly tender. “He chose this color. He practiced this color.”

“You know him already,” Quinn said, level, not accusing.

She did. In the way you know someone in a dream. In the way you know the silhouette that shows up when you close your eyes after a day of staring too hard. She sometimes saw him walking in front of her headlights at night, or standing on the meridian holding a bouquet made of receipts. She had given him a face once, just to make him stop knocking on the inside of her skull. But the face kept changing: sharp cheekbones and then none; eyes that electrician-blue and then muddy as river water. The one constant was the sound he made when he was looked at: the hiss of a match, the little laugh of someone who had been told no so often he had started to wear it like a coat.

“Name?” Quinn asked.

“What?”

“He said maybe. You think there’ll be a he who shows up. A… Nicolas? Doesn’t every predator like to pick a silly name?”

She did not flinch. But the name hit the inside of her like heat lightning. Nicolas. It arrived with the soft weight of a glove dropped on tile. Why had her brain kept that one? Because it was common enough to hide in plain sight. Because when you said it fast it became Ni-clos, and closeness was a joke people tell themselves to go to sleep.

“We’re not calling him anything yet,” she said.

“Okay.” He took a swallow of coffee and winced like the taste had turned. “Okay.”

She’d been called a soldier when she returned to Nashville, and then a detective, and both labels fit like a jacket you steal from someone you love and wear anyway, sleeves too long, shoulders a joke. She was built for standing still with her hand on a holster, for listening to the middle note in a lie. She had learned in the Army to make the world small: your squad, your sector, the radius you can see without turning. In the city, the world wants to do the opposite. It wants to widen until you can’t perceive the edges. You think you are smart enough to hold all that in your head and then you dream of deserts when it’s raining and you wake with grit in your teeth.

By the time they zipped Daniel Payne into a bag, the color had dried completely. The plastic rasped across it. There were little flecks on the concrete. A tech collected them with tweezer-slow care. She would get to sit in front of a microscope later and watch the world turn into flecks. It would be a comfort, how small and definite they could make things with a lens.

On the drive back, she took the long way—a loop onto the Jefferson Street bridge, the ramp curling up and around like a snake that had forgotten its own tail. The city tossed its light back in her face, buildings glancing like teeth. Banners over the minor league stadium still flapped with last season’s lies. Somewhere a siren laughed itself silly. She rolled her shoulders against the seat like she was making room for a ghost.

At her desk someone had left a file folder with a Post-it stuck like an accusation. Payne, Daniel. There were three pages in it she hadn’t put there yet: a driver’s license printout from the DMV that made him look fourteen; a campus ID photo where he tried too hard to look older—jaw jutted, hair ironed into obedience—and failed; an email printout from a professor that simply said, He missed class yesterday. Possible extension for midterm? The professor had probably attached a syllabus. Because that’s how adults apologize to each other: with PDFs.

She read the pages like prayers, knowing they would not answer and still hoping they would.

The receptionist dropped a package on her desk. Sturdy cardboard, taped and re-taped, address block printed in the tidy font of an old typewriter: Metropolitan Nashville Police Department: Detective Dodge. No return label, only a smear of something blue-green on the seam like a fingerprint from a child who has been allowed to play with his mother’s eyeshadow for the first time.

“Who’s it from?” she asked.

The receptionist shrugged. “Guy in a cap. Didn’t look at me. Left it on the chair by the elevators and skedaddled. You want me to call—”

“Stay,” she said, and picked up the box.

An intern hovered like a dragonfly wanting water. Quinn arrived as if conjured. “You want to bomb-squad that?” he said.

“You want to go get coffee,” she said, steady. “And bring it back. And then you want to sit exactly there and not talk for five minutes.”

“I can do that.”

She let herself listen to the sound of tape releasing as she picked at the edge. It was too neat to rip. It let go with a softness that made her throat feel strange. Inside the first layer was another box. Inside the second, a nest of paper shreds—magazines cut up for confetti. She sifted. The pieces bled ink on her gloves. Her fingers found the bottom of the box and touched fabric. She lifted.

A shirt, folded, used but washed until the cotton had given up remembering its own shape. Vandy colors, with a smear of turquoise at the hem like a carelessly wiped brush. She unfolded it. Someone had written in permanent marker along the inside of the collar: DANIEL P. Nice handwriting. The kind you teach yourself when you are bored in summer school, when your teacher is trying not to notice that you are practicing loops instead of listening to state capitals.

There was a note, only it wasn’t paper. It was a paint chip from a hardware store, the kind that lets you hold future walls between finger and thumb. The names printed on it were ridiculous lies: Morning Lagoon, Tidepool Smile, Glassy Sky. One rectangle of color had a circle drawn around it in pen. The circle was not quite even, as if the hand had been shaking or laughing. Next to it a word: Sorry.

Quinn returned and set the coffee on her desk as if he’d walked in on someone sleeping. He leaned over. She showed him the shirt, the paint card.

“Son of a—” he breathed. “How did he get that? From the victim? What does sorry mean?”

“Maybe one of those paint colors just took it too personally,” she said.

He almost smiled, but then his mouth folded shut. He knew better, even this early, than to let her get away with jokes. “This is him. The guy. You think this is him?”

She didn’t answer. The name wanted to be said. It sat on her tongue like a lozenge, cooling everything. She swallowed it back into herself.

She had been a soldier once, and the Army taught that names mattered. You called the terrain by what it would do to you. You called the wind by the sand it pushed into your ears. You called your fear by something that would make sense to a sergeant you could not disappoint, like Mama or Whiskey. A man like this one, if he was a man, wanted a name because the name would put a handle on him. It would make it easier to drag him out of the river of everyone else.

“Let’s go see Daniel Payne’s roommates,” she said.

It was late morning by the time campus let them in. Lawns sleeping under frost, squirrels not buying any of it. The dorm was an attempt at hospitality sponsored by the cold. Posters clung to cinderblock walls announcing a rally, a poetry reading, a job fair. Every face on every poster looked like it would apologize for something they hadn’t done yet. A boy with glasses and a straggly mustache opened the door to Daniel’s suite and immediately stepped back as if the cops had muscle memory from busting frat parties. He smelled like cheap ramen and laundry detergent.

“I’m Colin,” he said. He was not good at deciding where to put his hands. “Danny’s… I mean. Daniel. His friend. I mean, I was going to ask about him, but they sent an email that said someone would come and— Is he?.”

“Who else is home?” Dodge asked.

“Jae’s in class. Tye’s sleeping. He’ll pretend he’s not.”

The room was tidy enough for boys. A plant someone definitely forgot to water had invented a new geometry to live by. The kitchen sink looked ashamed. In Daniel’s room the bed was unmade in a way that suggested a quick exit, clothes heaped in the chair with a deliberateness that didn’t match the bed. Posters: a band Dodge didn’t recognize, a city skyline from a place he probably had never been. A strip of turquoise paint on a paper plate on the desk made her breath stutter. It was dried into a rubbery bend. Stuck to it was a blonde hair. She bagged it.

“Did he… was he in a relationship?” she asked. The questions were always banal, and they were always not banal. “Did he say he was seeing someone? Anybody leave a note, show up, call late, send too many texts? Anyone he fought with? Anyone he wanted to impress?”

Colin pushed his glasses up in a way that made his whole face seem to wish it could be elsewhere. “He was… private, I guess. But also he really cared what people thought? I don’t know. He was in this group project. He said the TA kept—you know what, never mind.”

“The TA kept what?” Quinn asked affably. He made himself soft on purpose, the way some people make themselves taller by wearing boots.

“Kept, like, not answering him. He’d email and email and only get a ‘maybe’ back. That’s stupid. I don’t know why I said it. It just—he had a thing about phrasing. Like if someone said ‘maybe’ he’d read it as ‘no.’ But because it was a ‘maybe’ he’d try harder. Is this helping? My tongue does this thing.”

“Your tongue is doing fine,” Dodge said. “Tell me about the last time you saw him.”

“He came in at midnight. He was on the phone. He was really quiet, which is how I know something was up because Danny could be quiet like he was going to war with himself, but this was like—control. He washed his hands for forever. Then he changed his shirt and took the one he’d been wearing and put it in the trash? I took it out. It wasn’t like, gross-gross. It had paint on it. I was like, art project? He said yeah, sure. He didn’t want to talk. He never puts stuff in the trash, though. He folds. He always folds. You know what I mean? Some people fold. His mom made him fold. He told me.”

“What color?” Quinn asked.

“What?” Colin blinked.

“The paint.”

“Oh. Blue? Not like a normal blue, though. That one that used to be on the nail polish my sister wore when she wanted to make my parents mad. You know?”

Dodge nodded as if he had told her something useful about bridges. “Turquoise.”

“We call that teal, where I’m from,” Colin said bravely, as though the color had insulted him personally. “But, yeah.”

“Did he ever talk about a Nicolas?” she said, and the room gave itself a small hiccup, like something on the stove boiling for one second when it shouldn’t.

“No,” Colin said too fast. “I don’t know a Nicolas. Should I know a Nicolas? Should… um. Should I call someone? His mom?”

“We’re doing that,” she said, and then wished she had lies that were kinder. She glanced at the tiny calendar pinned to Daniel’s wall. Every square full of abbreviations, test/test/test written in different pens like voices. On the day before today, a meeting circled: Skye at 8. The circle wasn’t even. It wobbled as if drawn in a moving car.

“Who’s Skye?” Quinn said.

Colin’s mustache shifted with his mouth’s uncertainty. “I don’t know. He had lots of… friends. He’d meet people in weird places. Like that art store on Fifth. He liked walking there when he wanted to think.”

Dodge knew the art store. The bell above the door sounded like a toy train panicking. The woman behind the counter had a hawk’s patience and hair the color of a fresh bruise. She looked at the badge then at Dodge’s face and asked if she was getting enough sleep. It was a reasonable question.

“Do you sell this?” Dodge asked, sliding the pain chip across the counter.

The woman laughed. “I have at least six brands with that shade and they all pretend they invented it. Men come in and ask me for it when Christmas is hard. Women buy it when they are leaving someone and want the walls to not take it personally. We do two-for-one on student Tuesdays. Your boy been in here lately?”

“Which boy?” Dodge asked, letting the words settle.

“The kind of boy who looks like he keeps getting told he’s almost there. It sits on their faces. Like a hand. They buy turquoise and charcoal pencils and say ‘the small ones, the cheap ones.’ I tell them paper is paper.”

“For the record, how do you know he’s a boy?” Quinn asked, smiling his soft smile. “All kinds of folks get told ‘almost.’”

“You’re right,” the woman said, and she did not apologize. She reached under the counter. “We keep a tab sometimes for kids who don’t have cards. We’re not supposed to, so don’t go making me heroic. I’ll check the names.” She pulled a spiral-bound notebook so tortured by the back pocket it had been living in that the metal coil bowed like a wrong instrument, pages crinkled. She licked her finger and flipped. “Here,” she said. “Payne. And—hey. He wrote other names sometimes, like he was testing how letters feel. This one—Nick? Nic? That was two days ago. He bought a cheap brush. He asked me what color would look good on bruises.”

“And you said—,” Dodge said, feeling the cold step into her elbows and set up a chair.

“I told him that’s a nasty question and I said peach because I wanted to see his face, and he laughed and didn’t buy peach and then asked for the exact opposite of peach. He wanted to know which whites are warm, which whites are cold. He bought fixative, which is a dumb waste of money when you still breathe money. He said he was going to make something no one could miss.”

They walked out with a receipt in a plastic sleeve, the small triumph of black numbers on crinkly paper. The street looked like it had been drawn with a blunt pencil. People looked like they had been drawn with a trembling hand. Dodge shifted her shoulder blades inside her coat like she could get free of something that had learned to hold her without hands.

“You said his name,” Quinn said on the sidewalk. “Back there. You asked about Nicolas.”

“I asked about a name,” she said.

“Not just any name,” he said gently.

“I’m not worried about names,” she said, and it came out the way you say I’m not drunk when you absolutely are.

When the day burned down to an ugly afternoon, they sat and watched the evidence do its slow trick. The lab would take longer. The lab was always a cathedral where nothing godlike happened quickly. She ate a sandwich with no taste and pretended to be human. She heard Davenport in the next cubicle practice the sentence he would say to Daniel’s mother and then heard him delete it and practice a different one. If you listen you can eavesdrop on the way men try to make grief easier. They fail, and they keep trying. It’s not nothing.

Her phone lit. Unknown number. “Detective Dodge,” she said.

A breath. Men have different ways of owning silence. This one breathed like he had been running and then stopped because he’d seen something incredible and shouldn’t share it with anyone. He was older than she’d thought he would be and younger, which is another way of saying the voice didn’t match the picture she didn’t admit she had.

“I tried to be decent,” he said. No hello. No I’m the one. “I tried to be kind about it. That’s what they always say. You should be kind when you leave someone. You should be kind when you say maybe. That’s the trick, right? Say maybe and they will beg you to let them give you something you didn’t ask for. It’s like magic but it makes your tongue dry.”

“Nicolas,” she said, because she was a person with a mouth and a lifetime of uses for it.

“Is that me now,” he said, and there was a smile the size of someone you don’t want to meet in any light. Maybe it wasn’t a smile. It was the feeling of having your chair pulled out from under you by a charming person who said sorry and then filmed you falling, for friends. “That’s okay. Names are coats. I can wear whatever you want.”

She let the phone record the silence for a second. Quinn was watching her. He was making himself into furniture. She put the call on speaker and set the phone on the desk like a bowl of milk someone wants the cats to find. “Do you want to talk about Daniel Payne?” she asked.

“You mean Danny,” he said, and the way he said it made her hate his tongue for a second. “He was handsome in the way boys are when they’re about to forget what to do with their beauty. He wanted me to see him. It’s a nice thing. Being seen. You know?”

Dodge stared at the paint card on her desk. The circle around Glassy Sky. Sorry. “You know he’s dead,” she said.

“That’s dramatic,” he said. “He’s colored. There’s a difference.”

“Where’s his phone?”

“Under a bridge,” he said. “Next to a bottle with flowers in it. You will like how pretty it looks before you hate it again.”

“Come in,” she said. “Let me see your face.”

“I’m sure you think I’ve earned that,” he said. “That’s always the ways of detectives on TV. ‘Let me look in your eyes and I’ll decide if you get to be human.’ I don’t want to be human. You’ll ruin it.”

“What do you want?”

He considered, and when he laughed it had nothing to do with humor and all to do with the sound people make when they remember a prank they pulled on someone gullible. “I want him to remember. I want them all to remember how a maybe is a no with nicer shoes.”

“Who told you maybe?”

He breathed. She heard something clatter lightly on his end of the line, like a brush against a jar. “Don’t worry. There’s a system to this. I don’t just pick. I want to fix something. Rejection’s an art form in this town. You’re all so polite it hurts. So I decided color would be polite too, and then—then no one gets to pretend they didn’t see. Listen, soldier. Are you listening?”

He had said soldier. It landed clean. She could feel the grit in her teeth again. The ribbon of river. Her squad leader telling her to open her mouth and breathe when the smoke got greedy. She swallowed. “I’m listening.”

“I’ll send you a map,” he said, and the call went dead.

It came a minute later on her email, from an address that looked like a prank. A screenshot of a pinned map. The little red drop near a public art installation by the pedestrian bridge, the kind with welded bicycles and declarations nobody reads. Quinn looked at her. She looked back. “You’re making a face like you’re about to sprint,” he said.

“I do not sprint,” she said.

They went anyway, because there is a point beyond which caution becomes a kind of fraud. The afternoon had tired of trying to be cold and simply was. People moved briskly as if they could outpace a feeling. Under the bridge a bottle sat upright, as promised, flowers in it—that stiff grocery-store kind that lasts forever because the water dies around them, wrapped in light blue tissue paper that had been ripped just so. Someone had stuck the bottle into a crack in the concrete. Someone had thought about angles. Next to it, a phone face-down.

Quinn approached with a stick, playful because people watch, and then solemn because they don’t. He flipped it. The screen was black. Dodge reached with her gloved hand. On the back, painted with care, a little circle in turquoise. The paint had bitten into the case.

“Is it a trap?” Quinn asked. He wanted to say it. He wanted to be right about one simple thing. The word trap implies intelligence you can wrestle with. Sometimes the thing that gets you isn’t a trap; it’s gravity.

“Everything is a trap,” she said to the wind, to the river, to the problem inside her own head. She put the phone in a bag.

That night she did not go home. She made deals with herself the way children bargain with dark rooms. If I finish this report, I can close my eyes in my chair for seven minutes. If I don’t think the name, other bad things won’t happen. She thought the name anyway, and not once, twice, a hundred—Nicolas—so that by the time the clock said three, it didn’t look like a word anymore. It looked like a mouth open and shut.

She had wanted once to have something other than work to go home to. She had tried. The way some people try to read complicated novels. She could do it and then she couldn’t. When a man said maybe she didn’t know how to leave him his word, she wanted to pure push him toward one thing, yes or no. The Army had taught her the neat trick of living with a plan and a backup plan and a map in your leg. Nashville had taught her that maps are suggestions at best, at worst lies told by a printer trying to be useful. In between was the man on the phone and his paint and the way he had said soldier like he had been there, like the smell of burning oil was just a memory of a candle.

Around four, when the office had gone to that hollow quiet that leaves even the coffee looking pinched, she went to the bathroom and stared at herself. Skewed ponytail. Lips like she’d been biting them, which she had. The mirror had a chip at the bottom where someone had set it down too hard years ago. It held onto the missing piece like a grudge. She washed her hands, not because they were dirty but because she wanted the sting of water. When she looked down she saw it: a smear of turquoise at her wrist, right where people wear watches when they want to be on time for their own excuses.

She didn’t remember touching paint. She scrubbed. It didn’t come off immediately. She rubbed until her skin complained and then it peeled, reluctantly, leaving a doubt behind. She could not tell if she was washing the color away or a bruise of coincidence.

“Hey,” Quinn said softly. He had come to the doorway without knocking. “I think I found where the phone’s been. There’s a bus stop camera. Do you want to— You okay?”

“Peach,” she said.

He blinked. “What?”

She shook her head. “I’m fine.” She dried her wrist thoroughly, the way you do when you want to lie to a wound.

They watched the footage in a room that smelled like cheap carpet and old gum. A man in a gray hoodie had put the phone under the bridge. He was careful. He’s always careful, she thought. He is somewhere between tall and not tall. He wore a cap, yes. He had the slump of someone who’d lost something early and kept trying to stand up straighter but could only do it when no one was looking. He looked, in other words, like everyone. He had put the phone down, the bottle, stepped back, stood and watched his offering to the god of incidental passerby, as if he wanted witness. Then he vanished at the edge of the frame, like he belonged to the part of the world that cameras can’t sing.

“Freeze it,” Quinn said. “Can we enhance, make him taller?”

She laughed, and the sound came out like someone else’s shoe. “We don’t get to enhance reality, Quinn.”

“You sure? Because that sounds like a nice trick.”

In the quiet before morning she called her mother. It went to voicemail. Her mother kept the same message she’d recorded ten years ago, the one that made her voice sound like a tin can tied to a back bumper. Hi it’s Lorene. Leave it clean. Dodge listened to the sound of who she had been when she was too young to be anyone and then hung up without speaking. Sometimes not saying what you feel is a kindness. Sometimes it’s simply not knowing which words will combust.

She fell asleep in the chair. She dreamed of the paint aisle at the hardware store, the little cards like stamps, like whale-tails, like all the ways a person could live if they could just decide. Nicolas pushed a cart past her, wheels squealing like they had opinions. He wore a shirt with someone else’s name on it. He stopped and took a card and swallowed it. He took another and tucked it in her sleeve. He did not look at her face but at her wrists. He said, in the dream, sorry, as if teaching a child a magic word. She woke with her fist clenched and the name in her mouth like candy she hadn’t meant to steal.

When the morning nametag changed on the city, when the sun pretended to be new, the lab sent a tiny miracle: a match to a brand of art paint more expensive than a student would choose, more specific than a house painter would bother with. They sent the formula, the pigment concentrations, the fancy word ethereal that the company insisted on in its catalog copy. A list of retailers. The one on Fifth. A whisper of a paint seller online who would ship no questions asked, wrapped like contraband, in boxes meant for books.

The ME had more to say now that Daniel’s body had had one more night of listening to the cold. Unremarkable contusions on the back of the head, consistent with a shove, a fall, not with a rage. No obvious asphyxiation but a suggestion. A shade of suggestion, as if life had been invited to leave with kind fingers, not yanked out with fury. No sexual assault. Paint entered cracks of skin, papercuts, a hangnail. The brush used had been a narrow flat, synthetic fibers. Green-blue residue at the base of the nail of his right thumb. He had been held by someone who knew how to hold.

They were learning not much and everything. They were learning style. They were learning patience. They were learning that this person would make a choreograph of his crimes, at least the part after the part that mattered—the part that left someone no longer an actor in the scene of themselves—so that he could have one pure thing: the delight of arranging, of watching the city be forced to admit to color.

Dodge drove at noon, because she couldn’t not. The art store again. The hardware store on the bad side of pretty where the old men sucked their teeth and told the cashiers how they would do it if they were in charge. She bought a small bottle of the color. She put it on the passenger seat and buckled it in. She drove to the river and sat where the first body had been, only now the ground had been washed by men who scrub for a living, and the weeds had grown arrogant in one night in that way weeds do—their life is a shout.

“What do you want me to see,” she asked no one, and someone answered in the shape of a shadow cast by her own head across the rock, the way it made a little theater. She closed her eyes and saw a turquoise ribbon pulled through a ring the way sailors show knots to children. She saw the knuckles of a man flexing as he paints around a nipple with decency, like he was letting the body keep its small secrets. She saw a word written on the inside of her skull in handwriting too clean and that word was maybe.

Her phone rang. The voice was calm and had been waiting for her. “You’re so close to falling in,” he said. “You keep standing at the edge like that. One little push, and you’re swimming. Do you like it. The color.”

“It’s gaudy,” she said. “It’s amateur hour.”

“Necessary,” he said. “Necessary is not always pretty. Ask a surgeon.”

She wanted to imagine him in this city as she spoke. She wanted to tilt her head and see in the corner of her eye a man on a bench pretending to be about to cry. She wanted the cage of him solid. But the voice was coming from the part of the day no one owns, and her head hurt with the way the river stood its ground.

“Who is Skye,” she asked.

He said nothing for the count of three Mississippi. “Skye,” he said, tasting it, like he was learning to pronounce a friend’s name in a foreign language. “Skye matters. Skye tells the weather how to behave. He—no. She. See what language does? She gave me a word once and I folded it up and put it in my mouth and sucked on it until it disappeared. It tasted like copper.”

“You killed Daniel,” she said.

“Language again,” he said, and the smile was back, sweet and dumb and arrogant. “I made him stop. There’s a difference.”

“Where are you?” she asked.

“Where you always are, soldier. Under bridges. On the edge of things. Breathing hard so you can hear yourself exist. It won’t help you. I am everywhere that ‘maybe’ lives. It’s a gorgeous country. We have mountains.”

The line dropped. It had never been a line. It had been a piece of string a child uses to make a cat’s cradle, and then hands that drop it, and then laughter that says it doesn’t matter.

Back at the office the walls seemed an inch closer than they had last week. The plant on the windowsill had resurrected in her absence, which meant someone else had watered it, which meant kindness could be anonymous and not demand repayment, which meant she could stand it again for five minutes. Quinn sat with his feet not quite touching the floor, a grown man trying to make himself smaller out of respect, or fear, or because he’d learned from someone that women give more truth when you don’t loom.

“You think Daniel paints,” he said.

“Painted,” she corrected without kindness. “Yes. No. He let himself be painted. That’s different.”

“You think the killer is—”

“I think he knows how to make a brush’s edge look like it didn’t get there by accident,” she said. “You see the pores on his shoulder where the paint pooled? He went slow. He was not angry. Rage doesn’t go slow. He thought he was doing a service. He thinks he has a point, Quinn, which is worse than the other kind. And he—” She stopped because there it was again, the smear on her wrist, ghost of a color she’d washed away. She had not put her hands in the paint. She had not leaned against the bag where the phone was sleeping. She had not—

“You okay?” Quinn asked.

“I need a shower,” she said.

“You and me both,” he said.

She went to the locker room and leaned against tile and let the water slap at her shoulders until she felt scraped and honest. She put her forehead against the cool wall. She thought about the way she used to stand in showers on bases a half-world away, the way the pipes rattled like old men in a church basement, the way the water smelled brackish and clean at the same time. She thought about the boy’s eyelashes with beads of paint on them. She thought about the smile in the man’s voice and the way it made him seem like someone she’d known in a line, waiting for a signature, the way boredom makes friends out of strangers. She thought about a story she had told herself about being competent, and how competence was a coat that eventually smells like smoke.

When she stepped out, a towel around her, her phone was buzzing on the bench. A text from an unknown number. A picture. Her car, parked by the river where she had sat. On the hood, a single handprint. Turquoise. The fingers long. The thumb set a little far from the rest, like a man who had learned to use tools with his left hand because someone had insisted that right was right.

She did not call Quinn. She stood with the towel and let herself not think for the space of three breaths. Then she pulled on clothes with the efficiency of a person who learned young how to be ready faster than someone could yell orders. She walked to her car and the handprint was exactly where the picture had said it would be, and the paint was wet.

The river said hey hey hey and the wind said nothing and she put her hand, just for a second, almost in the place where his had been, and she told herself not to, and she did anyway. She lifted her fingers. The color held. She rubbed it with her thumb. It gave off a smell that made her mouth flood, like something candied and chemical, like holidays that happen in houses where you know better than to go.

She went home finally, because even detective work is a kind of endocrine system that can only pump so long without recalibrating. She fed the cat that had adopted her after someone left town, a fat orange politician with the name Plank. She stood at the sink and let the tap run cool as if she could drain her head that way, let the city’s pipes hum to her, the voice of a thing that exists only to keep people from noticing what it does. The news was on because she didn’t turn it off. They were talking about a sculpture downtown with a new coat of paint, a prank, teenagers probably. The sculpture had been painted the wrong color, the anchor chains made ocean where they should be iron. The camera loved the guy in a beanie who said art is for everyone. The camera didn’t love the fact that the anchor chain looked like a bracelet on the city’s wrist.

She slept. She dreamed a harmless dream about breakfast. She woke with her mouth full of the taste of copper and a word she didn’t speak even in the empty room.

In the morning, before the sky had decided what to be, she drove to a field where they used to run drills, zigzag cones yelling at you usually in winter because that’s when budgets remember you. She ran between them until the hate in her calves unclenched. She stopped on the far side and bent double and touched the ground because she had promised herself that whenever she forgot how to be here she would touch this, this dirt, this ugly useful earth, until it told her there were worse things than the voice of a man who thinks he has invented color.

When she stood, he was standing by the bleachers, hands in the pockets of a coat that wished it were new and wasn’t. He was neither tall nor short and his face was one of those that on some days looks like the lead boy in a school play and on others the kid who holds up a tree and says he’s an actor too. He lifted one hand as if asking a question in class. He was married to the city, she thought. He had that look: people who stay after everyone else leaves and hold the door for you and then step aside and watch you go.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” she said, and the wind took her words and threw them on the ground and laughed.

“Neither are you,” he said, and if she had closed her eyes she might have heard him without his mouth.

She took a step. He took a step back and smiled and it was not a threat, not exactly, but the same feeling you have when you see a child on a railing. “Sorry,” he said, and she wanted to slap the word off his tongue and tell it to be better than itself. “I was out of paint. Thought I’d come find more.” He lifted his hands and she saw that they were clean. She understood suddenly and with a heat that made her skin feel too tight: the paint on her wrist, the handprint on her car, the phone under the bridge—all of it like a schoolboy flicking notes, the pleasure of getting away with it.

“What do you want me to call you,” she said because she had to keep him speaking.

He shrugged. His coat made a small sound like a page turning. “Names are for later. Or never. You’ll make one up anyway and then you’ll put it on the news and then mothers will say it like a curse to their children. Keep your room clean or Nicolas will come in the night and color your shoes. I don’t want that life.”

“Nicolas,” she repeated, and it looked wrong in the air on this field. It looked like a coin you toss and it lands on its edge. “Why turquoise.”

“Because it’s the color of apology,” he said, delighted with himself, and then his face did a thing, a small fall like someone tripping over an invisible shoelace. “Because it’s the color that makes white want to be honest. Because it’s halfway to green but doesn’t know how to arrive. Because a girl named Skye once said it made my eyes look like I knew where I was going, and then she said maybe, and then she said not now, and then she said I’m sorry, and then she said can we still be— and I told her that sorry is a ribbon you tie on a gift you were never going to give.”

“You killed Daniel,” she said again, because the field, the cones, the way her calves had loosened—it all felt like a song that has lost its words.

“I painted him,” he said, and the last thing he said before he turned his face to the wind was almost tender. “He asked me to.”

He moved. Not fast. Not the way television goes. He simply figured out where to be where she was not, and then he let distance be a magician for him. He walked behind the bleachers and was not there, and then was somewhere else, and then the wind told her she had missed the only trick. She did not pull her weapon because there was nothing to shoot that would solve falling.

She stood there and the cones looked at her like little witnesses and the sky decided on a kind of gray that would not explain itself. Her phone went off. A text. Another picture. A wall this time, a modest brick wall somewhere she did not immediately recognize, the kind that keeps weeds from forgetting themselves. Painted on it in letters careful as stitches: HE SAID MAYBE. Painted in turquoise. Underneath, in smaller hand, like a whisper: Sorry.

The city would wake and see it. It would say teenagers again. It would say art is for everyone again. It would say maybe and then it would go to work.

She walked back to the car and sat, and she held the bottle of paint she had bought in her hand like an egg, and she felt the weight of colors she didn’t choose. When she turned the key, the engine made the little cough that meant maybe and then it caught and said yes, and she drove toward the wall that did not know it had become a message. In the rearview mirror, the field lay like a promise that needed more words to hold steady. Her mouth formed a name without sound and the name looked wrong and then it looked right and then it became just a shape.

She would catch him, she thought. Or she would catch herself catching him. Or she would catch the river and make it say one thing for once. She wanted something singular in a world made of maybes. She tightened her hands on the wheel and the smear of color on her wrist was gone because she had scrubbed it but not gone because nothing was gone in this city; it was merely painted over with something we could all stand to look at. She drove and did not blink because if she blinked she would have to decide what to make of the handprint and the phone and the boy and the way she had seen, in that field, a face that could be anyone’s and had decided it was one person and given him a coat of the only word she had left.3

The wall wore the words like a fresh bruise no one would admit to. Morning figured itself out in increments, the light unspooling over brick and chain link and the backs of buildings that had given up on trying to be anything but backs, and people arrived the way birds do—first one, then a few more, then suddenly there were too many and you couldn’t identify the one that mattered. Patrol strung tape and practiced their palm-out move that kept strollers and dogs and men in fleece vests at a theatrical distance. The turquoise did its trick in this light, saturated and sugared, the letters careful, the message personal and loud enough to carry over traffic: HE SAID MAYBE. The paint hadn’t dripped. Whoever had put it there had waited for the right humidity or learned patience by failing at painting enough to know when a wall will take what you give it. Below, in a quieter hand made for secrets and notes pinned under pillows: Sorry.

Dodge stood too close and then backed up because old brick wants to hold your skin. Her winter breath made a small ghost and that small ghost practiced hanging around and not being seen. The city had peeled itself down to the essentials overnight and put them on this spot as if it could point and say here, this, fix this part and watch everything else behave. A tech was on one knee, scooping chips that fell to her sheet of paper with the care of someone harvesting basil. The smell was fainter than by the river—cold eats the smell out of paint—but under it she could still hear the thinner and that chemical candy, the note from a catalog promising that if you bought enough of this you would belong to a gentler version of your life.

She let herself look at the edges. The lines weren’t masked off; no tape had given them that glass-bottle crispness, which meant a steady hand and a practice wall somewhere else where the stakes were lower and his heart beat differently. The curve on the y in maybe had weight it didn’t need and there was the little wishbone mistake where a left hand corrects itself in a hurry. She could see where he’d held the brush up and away once, a dot of turquoise like a star, not part of the text but all of it at the same time, a painter’s automatic exhale. She could see where someone had painted over old tags a hundred times and where this layer chose to ignore those ghosts. The city was a palimpsest, her father would have said if he’d ever learned the word, but he hadn’t and he would have just called it stubborn.

“They’re calling it vandalism,” Quinn said at her shoulder, voice made of coffee and the way his scarf liked to climb his neck, city morning in his bowl. “We’re supposed to say graffiti like it’s a teenager with hurt feelings. You want me to do media? Or you want to make them like you for once.”

“Have I been doing it wrong,” she asked, steady, and saw the corner of his mouth tilt because he knew better than to believe she didn’t enjoy it when the cameras met her and then flinched and then tried again, like birds with a window they can’t understand. “What did the canvass get you.”

“A woman with a dachshund named Sergeant who swears she saw him at four forty, average build, not tall not short, cap, hoodie,” he said, making those words lean on each other as if they could stand up into a man. “Guy on a bike who says he slowed and asked if the city had hired someone to brighten things up. Painter didn’t look up, just said it was practice. I like that one. He sounded proud of himself, like the sentence had been waiting.”

The tech made a small noise—not a finding, not yet, just the body being careful. Dodge crouched and planted one flat palm on her thigh to keep the world from tilting. Under the new paint the wall wore old weather, freckles of soot, the blush from a former fire that hadn’t been sufficient to change the story. In the corner near the base where brick met weedy ground there was a crevice someone had offered cigarette butts to all summer. She tipped a stick in, fished something up slow. Glossed cardstock scraped with grit, the edge turquoise-stained where someone set it down careless and lifted it too soon. She held it by the corner and turned it. The card meant itself to be an appointment reminder; it had a dentist’s jawline smile printed in faded ink. Across the clean side, in a hand she’d seen twice now, all those loops that refused to be round, it read: SORRY LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

Quinn read it and went paler in that bowl-eyed way of his that made people hand him cookies. “He’s writing to us now,” he said. “Or to the city. Or to himself, out loud.”

“He’s writing to anyone who’s ever said maybe,” she said, and it sounded too wide, sounded like something you can’t get your arms around. She passed the card to the tech and the tech labelled it in neat block letters, the kind of handwriting that belongs to people who think one thing in their lives should stay simple.

A girl with a sketchbook had got too close to the tape and then made her body smaller so that the tape looked like it had moved to accommodate her. She wore a coat three sizes too big, thrift-store wool that made a sound like a moth chewing when she shifted. Her pencil moved fast, catching the point of the y and the wrongness of the a where it leaned toward the means what is said. She had drawn Dodge without looking at her, which is a gift or a crime, depending on who receives it. Dodge walked over anyway because pencil marks sometimes catch what cameras don’t. The girl did not look up; she consummated her line and then shaded the inside of sorry like she had seen a picture of an eclipse and wanted to live inside it.

“You see anything,” Dodge asked, gentle because college kids always think they’re getting in trouble when a badge says hello.

The girl kept drawing, the pencil making a sound like dry rain. “Saw a guy painting when I walked by. I thought it was for a festival. People don’t get mad when it’s for a festival. He had the wrong shoes for working outside. Leather that squeaked if he turned too fast, like old theater seats.”

“Left-handed,” Dodge said, not exactly a question.

The girl smiled without letting it break her face open. “You saw the flourish,” she said, and let the pencil make one around the y. “My professor says it’s a tell when people think they’re closing a circle, which is most of us. He mixed on his palm. You could tell he kept tapping the brush against his hand because he had turquoise here.” She touched the heel of her hand, the pad below the little finger, and spread her fingers like a starfish. “He kept looking behind him, but not like he was scared someone would stop him. Like he was hoping they’d try. He wanted to talk about it. That’s a weird thing to want.”

“Did he say anything to you,” Dodge asked.

“Just good morning, but he didn’t look at me when he said it. He looked at the wall, like the wall was the one talking back,” the girl said. She added a shadow down the side of the H and then, because she was kind, turned the sketchbook so Dodge could see. “He might come back, though. You know how some people are with their work. They can’t leave it alone. There’s this thing about symmetry. He doesn’t have it. He’ll want to.”

After the prints and the chips and the card got their little bags and the wall got its new life, media asked her for a sound bite big enough to put under a picture of someone’s breakfast. “Do you consider this a message from the perpetrator,” a woman in a hat that wanted to be more important than it was asked. Dodge said it could be and could not be and that the department was pursuing all leads and thanked the citizens of Nashville for their vigilance like it was a business transaction. She smiled with all her teeth and imagined the killer at home, wherever that was, watching and grading her on her posture. You’re an A when you don’t blink, soldier, he would say, and then he would prefer if she failed.

She and Quinn stood with their coffee on the sidewalk when it was over and watched the city's face look at itself. “Skye,” he said, not looking up from the steam rising out of his cup like a mistake. “It keeps getting more gravitational. I called the registrar and played nice and they pretended they wanted to help me because they liked my phone voice. There’s a Skye in Visual Arts—Skye Delaney—adjunct, projects on public practice, does those pop-up critique nights at a space called the Livery. Runs on donations and the fact that no one has torn it down yet. Our boy’s calendar circled Skye at eight. The Livery had a session last night. That tracks. There’s also a Skye in Counseling, Skye Benning, but she works eight to five and the meet-ups on her schedule are named and medicated. Which one you want to annoy first.”

“Both,” she said, and touched the corner of the card in her pocket like a charm she didn’t want to believe in. “Start with the one he went to. The Livery. Everybody pretends nothing is urgent until a thing is. Art people are better at saying the urgent thing without moving their mouths.”

The Livery was the kind of building people used to use to keep animals dry and now used to keep secrets respectable. Tall doors, paint peeling away in strips that wanted to call themselves river. Inside, the cold lived like it was paying rent. Metal folding chairs made little steel tongues of noise when you moved them and a row of clip lights tried too hard on a wire. On a table at the back were cookies turned to stone and a kettle that had learned to boil on sighs. The boards on the floor announced where anyone heavier than a thought stepped. Someone had written on the chalkboard a quote about failure and then someone else had added a longer, ruder sentence about failure’s mother. Students in hats wore their insecurity like fashion. The woman who owned the room in the way you own a storm when you know the clouds by name had a head of hair bleached to that color between new page and regret and a line of tattoos up one arm that read like a sentence. Skye Delaney was older than the kids and younger than the professors, the band of the woman who has discovered where she stands and is building a deck there.

“You’re interrupting my office hours without an office,” she said when Dodge showed her the badge, and her smile made the word cop look like a different word you only use with friends. “Heard about your wall. It’s pretty. People will get mad it’s pretty.”

“Daniel Payne circled you on his calendar,” Dodge said. “Eight o’clock last night.”

Skye’s face did not fall and did not change and did what good faces do when they need to hold a thing and not drop it. She nodded like a person nods when offered a cup she didn’t order. “He was here. He’s been coming Wednesdays when he can. He shows up hungry for it and leaves like someone has fed him and also punched him, which is critique. He likes clarity. The problem with the word maybe is that it invites interpretation and he wants the kind of answer that has a porch light,” she said, and picked up a piece of chalk and set it down again. “Is he— Have you told— Is someone—”

“We’re telling people,” Quinn said carefully, looking suddenly very, very young. “We are telling his mother. We are telling you because your name is on a circle. We need to know who talked to him last. Who he talked about. He had paint on his shirt. He put it in a trash can like he doesn’t do that. He went quiet when he shouldn’t have. He is painted now. Do you know why.”

Skye’s mouth made a line that could be mistaken for a horizon. “He was trying out something. He called it performance because it’s safer to do the scary thing if you put a frame on it. He found someone to paint on him. He said it made him feel seen in the way naked doesn’t, which, good for him. I told him to have a buddy and a safe word and to email me when he got home because I have a list of students I worry about in rotation like bedside charts. I said be careful with solvents and skin and he said he’d researched. I said I don’t like ‘researched’ when I can’t see the footnotes,” she said. “He was blushing when he said it. Blushing is a good sign in boys. It means they might not hurt you. That’s not science. It’s fieldwork.”

“You know a Nicolas,” Dodge asked. She did not let her voice do anything. She kept it where it was supposed to be, on the line that meant ordinary question.

Skye turned her wrist so that the tattoos along it—arrows, a compass, the word boundary in a typewriter font—shifted. She looked past Dodge for a second and then back, and in that second Dodge understood there were people for whom the memory of a person arrives with the weight of a stone in a pocket you forgot you put there. “I knew a Nick,” she said finally. “If you say Nicolas you sound like the principal. He was around here a couple of years ago when we still had a budget to pretend to be a community. That was dumb and brave. He came to critique and made everybody draw their hands without looking and then cried because he didn’t know how to talk about the difference between intention and impact and I told him that was the beginning of his education. He always smelled like laundry done at someone else’s house. He wanted to date the idea of me and I told him maybe because I wasn’t—that word. I needed to not be in anyone’s project for a while. I taught him to make gesso and he taught me that some men will turn your maybe into scaffolding and climb it,” she said, and leaned back against her desk, palms on wood, rings shining dull. “He showed up for a while and then he showed up less and then he stopped. He sent me a link once to a video of someone painting a body for a runway show and said this is art if fashion says it is and I wrote back and said this is art if consent says it is and he didn’t write back.”

“You tell Daniel that,” Dodge asked. Consent like a word the room could hold. She looked at the floorboards and how they bowed with the memory of too many feet.

“I told Daniel everything a person can tell another person without taking the brush out of his hand,” Skye said. “He was excited and also scared, which is the only honest way to make something. He said the painter liked turquoise. I told him everybody’s an ocean until they have to clean the sink. He laughed. He did that thing with his face like he thinks he might be loved if he does it right. That’s the face that gets me every time. I told him one day I would ban the word maybe. I say that a lot. My kids—” and she waved her hand at empty chairs and half-finished canvases and the silhouette of a person drawn in tape on the floor— “they are all just a chorus of maybes. It’s a project city. Everything is about to be something.”

“Did Nicolas come here last night,” Quinn asked. “Is he part of your scene now. He likes our wall.”

“Your wall is a sentence,” Skye said, and in the way she said it Dodge heard a tired love for the city that made excuses for itself. “He wasn’t here. If he was, I would have put a chair between us so I could sit in it. Users and abusers come in looking like hungry and if you’re not careful you think you can feed them. I don’t feed men like that anymore,” she said, and softened because she had said something hard. “If this is your man, he wears grief like a varsity jacket. He wants people to look. He learned to do that with us. Art is where you trial run your crimes. That’s a shitty sentence to say out loud, but most people use it to learn how to be better humans. Some people, though, go home and cut their crime out of cardboard to see if it fits in a box.”

Dodge took a breath that felt like lifting something heavy off a high shelf. “We’ll need names. People who were here last night. Anyone who would know where Daniel went after. Anyone who would vouch. Anyone Nicolas might have used for a mirror.”

Skye nodded. She had a list without looking. She recited names and numbers and handles that sounded like small animals, and when she said Colin’s name and then Tye’s, already in Dodge’s book, she added a third—a Jae who folded paper cranes and told new participants to keep their hands off the glue gun like a joke. “If you talk to my kids, you talk to them like you know they deserve to be here,” she said. “Otherwise I’ll write a letter and put it on the radio.”

Quinn smiled like that actually scared him in a small way. “Yes, ma’am,” he said, and it made the room warmer. It made Skye forgive him for existing.

They left with a flurry of names and the sense that the cold had opinions. Outside the air had decided on bright and brittle. Dodge unlocked the car and paused because the sight of the handprint had been burned into the back of her eyes and memory is a lazy beast. It wasn’t there now; her hood was clean save for dust and a scar in the paint from when a branch had tried to be more tree than it was. She held the picture up on her phone like a child comparing stickers to a sheet. The print sat there, five long fingers radiating from the heel, where he mixed the paint on his own skin, left hand, yes, thumb a little off because of the old injury he would tell a woman he wanted to sleep with came from shop class, a truth he told like a lie. Quinn looked at the picture and then at the hood and did a small thing with his mouth like a hinge thinking about itself.

“You tell me last night,” he said. He made it not a reprimand, made it a hand held out, palm up, you can put what you want in here and I won’t close it on you.

She told him something like the truth. She told him she’d come down to the garage and it had been there and she had bagged a swab off the edge because hope is a disease, and she told him about the text with the picture taken half a beat before she arrived as if the man had walked backward away from the car, phone up, whistling. His hand went to his pocket the way men do when they want to put something in their hands they can fix. He took it away empty.

“He is in your yard,” Quinn said. “He is leaving you a toy. He is not flirting with you. He is escalating. Do we want to talk about protective detail or do you want to use the word no on me right now.”

“No,” she said, sharp, and then softened because he had earned better. “I will not go home the same way twice. I will tell you the parts I don’t want to. You will not look at me like you’re sorry because I have already been looked at like that enough and it makes people do stupid things,” she said, and it did something to him; it made him human and not teammate for a second, made him show the way he had been trained to put himself away.

They sent the handprint photo to the lab and Rhea, who wore her hair in a braid like a rope she could tie herself to something with, wrote back with a kissy face and a promise and the line give me two hours and your favorite donuts. They sent the wall samples and the new card and kept the receipt from the art store in its sleeve like a holy thing. The lab would pull binder and pigment ratios apart until they sang their little chemical song. The bus camera was feeding footage now, and in the blue-light room where reality goes to be argued with they watched the man in gray again, watched the way he didn’t hurry and didn’t slow, watched the little three-inch habit in the swing of his left arm that people get when they’ve had to carry weight there too long. He put the bottle down like he was giving it a good home. He stepped back and admired his own correctness and then he was gone, into that corner of the frame where your life always walks off to if you let it.

“Skye Benning,” Dodge said, late in the day when the body makes a liar out of your ambition, and they walked across campus to a building that wanted to be wood and was eleven kinds of plastic. Student Wellness had couches that looked like snacks and a bulletin board dressed up in emojis. The receptionist smiled with her whole face because she had been hired to. Skye Benning came to get them with the kindness of someone who spends her days practicing being a person you can tell the truth to. She was small and fortressed in a cardigan and her nametag made a low-grade noise against her lanyard. Her office had the good tissues and a plant that had been watered recently with faith. She sat without closing herself behind a desk because desks are policies wearing suits.

“Daniel Payne,” Dodge said, and watched the woman put her hands in her lap so she wouldn’t reach up and touch her own face.

“We’ve met,” Skye Benning said. Her voice was not soft, it was exact. “He is— He was— He is a client. I say ‘is’ because what we do here exists outside of his body and in it at the same time and the tense is an argument I lose when we are done. I can’t tell you what we talked about. I can tell you it was Wednesdays at eight because that is public information, the door and the logs and the fact of his feet. I can tell you he wanted to be okay and that’s not a bad start,” she said.

“We’re not asking for the inside of him,” Quinn said, which was a lie, because police always ask for that without asking, they stare at the couch to see if it remembers, at the window to see if it watched. “We’re asking who waited for him when he left. We’re asking if anybody walked him to the door more than once. We’re asking who sits out there pretending to scroll and listens through this wall. We’re asking if anyone said maybe and got to turn that into a life’s project.”

Skye Benning smiled the smile of a person who sees the whole thing and can do nothing about that. “You want to know about Nicolas,” she said, and it was not a question. “I have a man who likes my lobby. He likes my hours. He has discovered that if he shows up and uses the coffee machine and sits on the edge of that blue chair,” she pointed, and Dodge looked and it was blue in the way dentists paint rooms, “that he can be near something soft. He does not meet with me. He insists he has no appointment. He uses a different name each week, as if he is trying them on. I tell him the chair is for clients and he says I am a client and I say not here and he says maybe and he says sorry in the way that boys say it when they think the word is a charm,” she said, and the plant leaf trembled in her office as if to underline the sentence. “He came last night. Sat long enough to be counted by a building. Watched Daniel leave. I told him to get out and he left. I am tired of maybe. I am going to write a book. Do you want to arrest me for being tired.”

“What name,” Dodge asked, and her pulse had discovered a drum it wanted.

“Nick, Nico, Cole, once he tried ‘Blue’ and I laughed and he looked like a dog who doesn’t get the joke,” Skye said. “He is average. He is the lab-grown diamond of men. He is a salesman’s son. He smells like something that used to be wealth. I can show you the camera footage of the lobby because my boss likes the feeling of control.”

They watched him. The lobby camera was kinder than the bus one, closer, full of the little things people don’t notice they do. He came in, cap low, hoodie, left hand scuffed with paint if you knew what to look for, the thumb bent away a fraction, soft old scar crossing the knuckle like the letter X. He poured coffee and spilled and cleaned the spill with competence like it shamed him to do it badly. He sat in the chair and looked at the door the way people look at doors when their idea of love is a hallway that keeps ending. He watched Daniel leave with his shoulders. He didn’t get up. He didn’t follow. A minute later he did. He stood at the lobby’s edge and held himself like a fence. He waited until Daniel was down the hall and then he walked, left hand in pocket like it was the thing that needed to be hidden.

“Time stamp,” Quinn said, because it made him feel like a man with a hammer in a world full of nails. They wrote it. They pinned it to the map of Daniel’s last hour. They felt a piece slide into place and it did not make a picture yet.

When the day got old enough to be honest, Rhea called. “Handprint paint is your fancy brand,” she said, cheerful as a bartender. “That specific turquoise, that same binder, micro-scratch pattern on the brush stroke that says synthetic flat, one bristle at the corner flares a little like a cowlick—maybe you’ll find that brush and it will be your glass slipper. More fun: latent ridge detail in the handprint. Turquoise is sticky in all the ways that matter. You’ve got ridges on the distal phalanges of index and middle. They’re partials but good. I can make you art out of them. You get me a suspect, I’ll tell you whether his hands have been places.”

“You’re magic,” Dodge said, and Rhea laughed through her nose.

“Donuts. Maple glaze. I like the ones with bacon. Don’t name it. Don’t let it name you,” she said, and hung up humming.

By seven the city had chosen its night face, slick and wanting. They drove past the wall again and someone had left candles that would gutter out in the wind and that didn’t matter because leaving them made a small muscle in the chest feel better. Someone had taped flowers to the brick and the brick drank the cold out of their stems. The turquoise was deeper now that the day had decided to quit. A couple in matching fleece kissed under the word maybe and took a picture and would one day look at it and call it fate. A kid in a patched jacket traced the letters with a finger he had dipped in sugar from a donut bag and left a snail trail of stick across the bottom of the b. The city was learning a new vocabulary whether it wanted to or not.

At her desk, Dodge opened Daniel’s phone. Rhea had coaxed it to speak and now it sat there, a rectangle full of almosts. Texts came like a prayer wheel. Colin about ramen. A sister about sending a picture of a dog in a sweater. A mother about a box of oranges because that is how some mothers keep the world at bay. A number unlisted, not saved, bubbles in gray and blue. The last string began the day before yesterday and read like a tightrope. You said maybe, he wrote. Not no, he wrote. Maybe is hope, he wrote. The gray bubbles answered. Makes it your decision but not my fault, the gray wrote. That’s the way of maybe, the gray wrote. I don’t want to break anything in you, the gray wrote. The blue answered fast. You can’t break anything, the blue lied. You just look and then I’m better, the blue wrote. There was a picture in the string, skin and a mark in turquoise where a brush had drawn a line over a hipbone like a coastline. There was a single word after, the gray wrote: Sorry.

Rhea pinged an associated account for the number. It hid under a prepaid cloud and lived there like fog. But the phone in the lobby behind the Wellness Center had spit out a text at the same minute the gray bubble did and the internal logs gave them a handmade map: their man leaned against a vending machine to borrow a signal, typed out his sentence, watched it deliver and then went to see if the sorry had worked on a heart. The building gave them the story it could and then ran out of nouns. It had nothing to say about bridges or rivers or walls.

“I want him in a room,” Quinn said, and his hand had found his gun without taking it out, the way men check their own pulse.

“You’ll get him,” Dodge said, and it was not hope and it was not a promise. It was something a soldier says when she has a field to cross and the field has an edge.

She drove home by streets that tried to forget her and did not. The cat yodeled his opinion at the door and then forgave her by head-butting her shin. She sat on the floor and let him step into the bowl of her lap and knead his bread on her thighs. She looked at the picture of the handprint until it dissolved and reassembled itself into a map: knuckles high, fingers long, a little scar there. She looked at her own hand and turned it palm up like the fortune-tellers in cheap tents and saw paint line remnants no one else would. Sorry looks good on you, the man had written on the card, and she wanted to put her hand through a wall in a calm, deliberate way. She wanted to say to the city stop teaching boys that apology is a costume. She wanted to get him in a room and close the door and watch his face learn about no, about single-syllable words, about the kind that stand their ground without knives.

Sleep came in chunks and brought her a dream about gashes of color that were fabric, not paint, ribbons tied to fenceposts where wind ran itself ragged. The ribbons said all the small words: soon, later, almost, someday, maybe, sorry, wait. She woke with the list in her mouth like beads.

Morning did not bother with seduction. It barged in and told her to put on pants. She did because she is obedient in the exact ways that have kept her alive. Coffee tasted like something trying to be a solution. The news put pictures of the wall in a carousel with fall foliage and a segment on dogs that dress like people for charity. The mayor said words that wanted votes from everyone and thus meant nothing, and a councilwoman said art is conversation and the city needed more of it and Dodge didn’t disagree with her, not really, she just wanted to choose the topic.

On the way in, her phone shivered. A map again. The little pin near a motel with a neon sign that had lost two letters so that it now shouted something dirty at passing traffic. A message without a greeting: You can see me if you want. He used a picture of a paint palette as his avatar. He had put a French filter on the word color like it made him more interesting.

She didn’t tell Quinn right away. She drove there and parked where she could see the office but not be seen. The kind of motel where towels have never forgotten who they used to be and the clerk is someone’s cousin stealing time along with cigarettes and the vacuum cleaner has a limp you can hear even through walls. Men came and went like punctuation. She adjusted the rearview mirror and saw herself and the turquoise memory went through her like glass. In the office a television did that daylight talk show babble and a woman with a wig placed like a hat counted something with a clicker.

He came out like a man who leaves last, not because he had nothing else to do but because he liked being the period. Dark coat, cap, that average height that makes every witness untrustworthy. He paused, not because he felt her eyes but because men like him know how to make a moment a frame. He set his palms on the motel railing like it was a mantle piece and turned them up like he was going to show something to the cheap sky. They were clean. That was the new detail that made her mouth dry. He was cleaning himself again, purging, making innocence where paint had been. He looked down over the parking lot like a prince over his kingdom of dented cars and then walked. She let him go because she needed him to go somewhere so she could decide where to end it and not just spill her bullets across a place where women with wigs count beds.

She told Quinn after, because she had promised, and he did not scold her but his ears went a little red and that was worse. He called two cars and now their average man had an average tail. If he bought dumplings, they would know. If he went to the river, they would be there first. If he called her, she would not answer for one measured beat and make him think about what it means to wait.

The day gathered itself in the ugly way days do and they decided to go another place where the turquoise had left its breath behind. The art supply stores had given them nothing except receipts and the man’s fondness for higher-end labels; the hardware store had given them a clerk's memory of a guy who asked for a discount and then had exact cash and smiled too long. They needed someone's eyes not on a payroll. They went to a barber who once cut Dodge’s hair so badly she liked him for being honest. They went to a diner where the waitress had taught three generations of cops to eat eggs and not count it as a weakness. They went to a bridge and stood under it and waited for the river to get bored and tell a different story.

When the call came, it wasn’t a map. It was a sound. Screaming makes a shape in air you can draw if you have the right pencil; this was a woman’s voice and a man's laughter behind it and the sound of something heavy deciding to be lighter. They made it to a vacant lot two blocks from the motel, and the lot wore its history of burned cars and prayers like a jacket. In the center, a mannequin stood on a milk crate, painted in that same turquoise, eyes drawn on with exquisite care, lashes that someone had put their tongue out to get right. Around its neck an index card hung on yarn, crooked, like a kindness performed by someone who didn’t really mean it. The card said: TRY AGAIN.

Neighbors stood with their arms folded and their judgment already written down. A man in a yellow cap said this city needs Jesus, and a woman whose jawline had never forgiven her for anything said this is what happens when you defund everything that matters and by everything she meant what she meant. Kids stood behind the tape and learned. The mannequin’s hand was up, not in a wave, but in a posture Dodge recognized from something she couldn’t place. Prayer? Theater? Surrender? She put her fingers on her own wrist and felt for paint that wasn’t there.

“He’s practicing with the city now,” Quinn said, and something in him went flat in a useful way. “He wants us to get good at reading him. He wants applause. He will escalate.”

“He thinks he is,” she said, and the river air stepped into her nose and set up camp. “He thinks this is escalation. He’s a coward with pretty supplies. He will misjudge the size of his own shadow and then he will not see the wall until his face is in it.”

She signed the log for the mannequin like it was a person and that felt indecent and necessary. She told Rhea she was bringing it to her like a cake she didn’t ask for. She took a picture of the index card and sent it to no one. She took one more of the hand, the way the thumb leaned away from the rest like a person at a party who wants to talk but can’t commit. She opened her messages and there was a new note waiting like a coin in an old coat pocket. He had written: You are getting warmer. That is a sentence people put on maps and also on children.

She closed her eyes and saw the field again, those cones like small orange witnesses, the man by the bleachers, the way he’d called her soldier like he had a right. She wrote back, against everything she knew, against the part of herself that wore doctrine like skin. She typed: Tell me where you learned to make a line that clean. He read it in less than a second. He took his time answering, which made her want to peel the paint off the world.

He wrote: In a house where nothing was ever left alone. My father painted rooms to keep the walls quiet. We moved a lot. He taught me to cut in without tape because tape is a weakness. If you can’t make the edge clean with your hand, you’re not a man. Then he wrote: Did your father teach you to hold a gun or did the Army do it because your father could not.

She saw the old man in a Yankees cap, nicotine fingers, paint on knuckles even when he swore he’d washed, forearms the color of the first day of summer and a cough like winter. She saw his laugh when a drop hit the floor and her ten-year-old urge to clean it before he noticed. She saw the ladder and his two-fingered whistle when he wanted a rag and the way he made yellow behave in a kitchen that wanted to be dark. She closed her eyes and swallowed his ghost. She did not answer. You cannot give a thief a map to your house. She put her phone face down in the ashtray she didn’t use and watched by not watching.

Night laid a hand on the city’s head and smoothed it down, again and again, as if that could make it easier to sleep. They got two dozen tips, a hundred opinions, a call from a woman who said turquoise is for boys who never grew up and then cried, a message from a man who said he had been painting fences for thirty years and he knew a clean line when he saw one and this was showroom, a pastor who wanted to pray with her on the phone and did before she could stop him, and it was not awful. They got a note from the art store woman that said your boy’s credit line came through, the anonymous one I told you I shouldn’t have, and the last charge was two weeks ago, and someone like a teacher had slipped some cash in the pot. They got silence where they wanted music and laughter where there should have been none.

Before midnight, when the bad part of the day puts its shoes on and goes out, Colin texted her a thing he had found in Daniel’s desk, something he thought was nothing and then decided was something. He sent a picture of a folded receipt from a coffee shop near the river with a sentence written on the back in that tidy, summer-school handwriting: Skye says we practice endings so they don’t surprise us. Eight, Thursday, south steps, bring proof. The date was three weeks old. The proof, she supposed, had been Daniel himself, painted and shaking and asking somebody to put a name to it. She saw him walking away from a woman under a streetlight who asked if he had water. She saw him sending a message that said sorry because somebody somewhere had told him that word is a key. She saw a man standing with a brush and the patience of a saint, placing color where it would do the most damage and telling himself he was fixing something.

She went to the south steps because the map of this city inside her needed a pin there. They were old concrete and new gum, the river loud, the bridge lights practicing being stars. She stood and put her hands in her coat pocket and leaned in that way people lean when their skeletons are tired. She thought about war and walls and the idea that the river had a spine. She thought about the way you learn to cut a line clean, no tape, no cheat, hand steady, breath even, your father watching, saying now, there, see, that’s a man.

Footsteps came and went and none of them were his. She stayed until cold made itself a law and then she went home by a way that had fewer corners. In her kitchen she took the little bottle of turquoise she’d bought and unscrewed it and smelled it like a person committing to a mistake. She dipped a toothpick in and made a dot on a Post-it and stuck it to the inside of a cupboard door where only she would see it. She considered writing a word and she didn’t. She closed the door and the dot was a consequence.

At two, when the city was practicing its sermon for Sunday, he called. His breath came in quiet and she heard the television in the background tell someone else how to feel. “You went to the steps. You’re playing now,” he said, pleased, like she had picked the same card as him out of a deck and he could pretend that meant something. “I knew you would. You like old places. You like when the ground remembers more than you do.”

“Tell me where you are,” she said, and her voice did not shake because she had learned her voice belonged to her even when everything else didn’t.

“Even if I did, would you want to come,” he asked. “Or would you send the boy with the scarf and let him play at being your knight. I think you like being alone with the bad thing. It makes the good thing make sense when you get home and feed your cat. This is me being honest. Are you writing this down. Is the tape rolling.”

“You said the word soldier,” she said, and she was done waiting for permission. “What do you want me to believe about you when you say it.”

“I want you to believe I understand,” he said. “And then I want you to discover I don’t. That is the space I live in. That gap. That’s where I build. Do you want a present. You haven’t said please and I was raised by a man who thought manners were required, but I’ll give it anyway because I’ve had a day.” He laughed softly and her scalp prickled because it sounded like a match drawn along stone. “Look at your email. I found you a brush.”

He hung up in that way he had, cutting you off like a bad limb. Her email chimed. A picture waited, taken in a bathroom where the mirror was old enough to hate its own job. The sink held a brush, flat, synthetic, bristles flared at one corner like a cowlick, the handle stained with a halo of turquoise and a thumbprint. The faucet leaked. The caption read: 118 Carroway. Hurry. Paint dries.

She stood so fast the chair gave a cry and then she was moving, coat, keys, gun, phone. She called Quinn and left a sentence that was a destination and a plea disguised as an instruction. She didn’t use sirens. The city did not need to know. The street was two lanes holding a fight between a church and a layaway furniture store, a pawnshop that called itself a boutique and the house with the porch that had always, even before there were cops in it, looked like a place people watched from. The number was on the post in a metal font that had lost a screw and listed. She knocked and no one answered and she pushed and the door did the thing that means nobody made it their habit to lock against the ordinary.

Inside smelled like other people’s cooking and a mop that wanted to be more than water. A light was on in the bathroom at the end of the short hall the way all tragic bathrooms live. She walked in with her body arrayed for bad news and found the brush like he promised, in the sink, bristles wet, the stain of turquoise on porcelain like a bruise. On the mirror, written backwards so it would read right when you faced it, in finger dragged through fog: MAYBE.

She stood and the tub’s drip counted off seconds that weren’t polite anymore. She turned the brush with a glove, looked for hair caught in the ferrule, found one navy thread and a gray eyelash and a cat hair from a cat that wasn’t hers. In the hull of the sink a print had left itself like a fossil, palm and the swirl of skin, and she breathed out slow. He had given her a present he wanted her to think he regretted. He had left the thing that would say his hands had been somewhere, because this was part of the game he thought they were playing. In the hallway, a faint sound, a foot on a stair. She turned and aimed and a woman flinched into her doorway wearing a robe and fear and holding a plastic bag as if it had the answer.

“I rent him the front room,” the woman said, and the words made a small wind in the hall. “Nick. He’s good with cash. He says sorry when he is late. He makes the bathroom smell like a swimming pool. Is there trouble. I do not want trouble in my house.”

“There’s always trouble in your house,” Dodge said gently, and put her weapon down, point lowered, voice making a promise she could not keep. “Pack a bag and go to your sister’s or wherever it is you go when men love you badly. We’re going to take some of your things and we’re going to leave you a phone number and your life is going to be loud for a while.”

The woman blinked the way people blink when they don’t have a habit for crying. “He painted his hair in the sink once,” she said, and the sentence was a child offering a broken toy to a grown-up. “He said it made him young. He left a shirt in the dryer. You can have it because I never want to touch it again.”

Dodge took the shirt. V-neck, cheap, spattered with tiny turquoise comets. She took the brush and the print and the heartbeat of the room. She took the image of herself in the mirror with the word maybe across her chest backwards, which felt like an orthodoxy. She took the knowledge of a street where her boots made a sound like the men down by the river, rain on cardboard. She walked out into the night that had decided to be honest with her and she let herself think, for one unkind moment, about the way his mouth had looked when he said sorry and about the way she would shut it. Then she put the thought away because that is not what good women do and also not what useful ones do. She put the address on the map. She put her finger on the place where the line had been clean. She felt the city tilt a degree toward something like gravity. Then she called Quinn again and when he answered she said the word yes like it was the first time she’d gotten to all week.Quinn got there with his tie loosened and his breath fogging and the way he held his shoulders said he hadn’t decided yet whether to break rules or write them down. Patrol was two minutes behind him with the tape and the posture and the clipboard that always made new places feel like they had been born guilty. The landlady watched from the threshold of her room, robe knotted like a promise she never meant to keep, the plastic bag swinging on her wrist with three potatoes and a loaf of bread inside, because hunger keeps its own schedule even when crime gets fancy. Dodge walked him through the sink, the word on the mirror, the easy door, all of it sounding simpler when you said it than it ever is when you live in it. Quinn took the brush from the glove like it was a hatchling and grinned toward the ceiling as if Rhea were already up there, spinning miracles out of bristles and binder. He asked the landlady if he could see the front room and she said it wasn’t a front so much as the place where heat arrived first, and then she handed them a ring with three keys and a rabbit’s foot balding from use. If you spend long enough around lethal men you start to love women like that extra, the ones who hang the calendar at the right height and count blankets with their fingers and believe in God only after lunch.

The room had been emptied with the precision of a man who had been emptied himself a long time ago and learned to like the feeling. Bed made, the hospital corners a sermon. A duffel gone. The closet a confession of nothing. What was left was the part he wanted her to find. On the windowsill a strip of painter’s tape was stuck like a Band-Aid, and along it five strokes of turquoise descending from fat to fine, a practice of pressure, the kind of thing fathers make sons do in kitchens when the television is too loud to talk over. On the table a stack of paint cards stolen from the same bins in different stores, the names circled in pen with that not-quite-perfect round—Glacial Tide, Pacific Ring, Poolhall Kiss, Robin Glass, January Sea—and in the corner of each card, a tiny letter like a grading rubric, A or B or a single irritated C. There was no notebook, no manifesto; there were index cards, three of them, the words written as if the paper had opinion: MAYBE, SORRY, HE SAID. Under the bed a shoebox held a hand towel with stiff corners from old paint, a lighter, a Metro bus pass loaded to the edge of thoughtless convenience, three art store receipts, two for the fancy brand and one for the cheap brush that had a bristle that flared like a cowlick. In the garbage, the pale ghost of hair dye had left a blue smear where water remembers.

Rhea took the brush like a woman accepts a bouquet she did not want, with reverence anyway. She laid powder in the sink and teased the print like you coax a memory out of a drunk cousin at a wedding. She lifted it with tape and breathed onto the mirror to make the word become the thing it had been when the finger wrote it. She said the ridge detail on the sink was clean enough to hang a name on if the database offered generosity, and if not, she would cross her eyes and call it art and listen for a match. She bagged the painter’s tape because oils rub off and men touch with the same hand they gesture with when they are proud. She let the landlady sign the bottom of the chain of custody, and when the woman asked if that made her complicit, Rhea said it made her useful, which is the better thing to be.

Beneath the radiator was the only filthy corner. He had missed it, or he had left it to see if anyone would come all the way down and look. Dodge got on her knees and laid her ear to baseboard and felt the house complain into her skull. She fished with the cheap pen she always used so the nice ones would stay nice and dragged something into light, a wad of gum folded around a hair. The hair was female, long, blonde, and had a pearl clip clasped to it like a jaw. The gum was the kind that tastes like someone telling you to be optimistic, blue and sugar-free. She bagged it, and when she stood there was grit on her jeans and her knee had a complaint to file and the landlady said she told him no gum and then shrugged like boys will be boys and not men for so long it becomes a ghost story.

The cupboard over the sink had a single mug in it, white with a ring of lipstick nobody in this room had put there. He had cleaned around the lip with a kind of disgust that left everything else shining. On the sill behind the curtain a little jar of mineral spirits had been wedged into a corner like a secret, lid loose enough to talk. She tightened it with two fingers and it squealed like a mouse so small it didn’t know it could die. There were no pictures. The only thing like a picture was the way the bed had been made, the way the edge turned down with a ninety-degree certainty, the way the pillow had been fluffed and then patted flat, leaving the wideslat impression of a hand that believed in rectangles.

Quinn found a towel in the dryer that didn’t belong to any woman with taste. It was motel thin, stamped with the name of a place that had changed hands three times this decade. A shirt fell out stuck to it like a surrender flag, cheap cotton V, small spatter of turquoise on the hem, a bite-mark from a dog at the cuff or a man with a nervous habit. He held it up and then dropped it into a bag and said the thing he always said when there was too much and not enough: okay, okay, okay. Patrol put a lock on the door that would not stop anyone worth stopping. The landlady signed another line and took the officer’s card and asked if she could smoke in the kitchen now and Dodge told her to do whatever she needed to do to make the air belong to her again. The woman lit the cigarette like a prayer and looked at the word on the mirror and then closed the door to the bathroom without breathing out until she had.

The captain liked this kind of night because it made sense of the chair under him and the brass on his desk. He came down from the fourth floor to stand in the doorway of Dodge’s cube while she was spreading the cards and the scores and the receipts out on a map of the city and putting yarn nowhere, because she wasn’t that kind of detective and she was never going to be. He stood long enough to be counted and said they would have a press conference at ten with as few adjectives as possible, and that the mayor would say art is conversation and the department would say crime is not art. He told her to sleep and then did that thing bosses do with women they respect and fear: he asked if she needed anything and when she said no he believed her and hated that he did. Quinn fell asleep with his head on the back of his chair and his mouth open a fraction and his scarf making an untidy nest, and when he snored once, he woke himself and apologized to the ceiling like it has feelings.

Rhea texted at three with a photo of the lifted print from the sink and the handprint off Dodge’s hood laid side by side, the ridges lined like a hymn you know in your bones, and wrote: same boy, congrats on your taste. She wrote again at four with a link to a partial hit in a database that did not belong to police and wasn’t supposed to be searchable, a thumbprint from a study at the Livery where Skye Delaney had once had participants ink their hands and press them to paper to talk about labor and ownership. A man named N.H. had signed his sheet with initials and a little flourish on the H that looked exactly like the swallow of ink on the tail of the y down at the wall. It wasn’t true, not yet, it wasn’t enough, but it was something for the mouth to hold. Rhea wrote: tell your adjunct she runs a tidy ship, we could learn from her index cards. Dodge wrote back: I’ll send donuts with bacon if you give me a name for the N.H. and Rhea sent a GIF of a woman putting on lipstick in a rearview mirror and wrote: manners, soldier.

She didn’t sleep at her desk because sleep at your desk says a thing about you to the wrong person. She went home and put water on her face and it ran off her like she had waxed herself with grief. She fed the cat whose love came with terms and slept in her bed with the window open because the night needed somewhere to leave. She dreamed a dream that was part recruitment video and part art school, a drill instructor with paint on his knuckles yelling cut in, cut in, cut your line clean, no tape, the hand is your tool, the heart is a liability, and woke with the taste of chalk in her throat and the faith that whatever shadow the man cast was going to have to pass through a place she could stand.

Morning in this city is always a little theatrical. The sky tries on three different lights before it commits. Dodge bought the donuts Rhea wanted and two she didn’t, because sugar makes people generous with nouns. Rhea took a bacon mapleglaze and made a satisfied noise that belonged in a different room and then turned to her machines and wrote an algorithm to love what she loved. She put the brush under a microscope and they all leaned in like children at a zoo. Tiny turquoise flaked at the edges of synthetic bristle clamped in nicked metal, a fingerprint in the seal where a man with the wrong hands had put the thing together in a factory in a country that makes room for your cheap. Rhea flicked the dial and showed them a single dark hair wrapped around a bristle like a well-meaning snake, and said she would tell them what floor cleaner he used if they wanted, but also give her thirty to run the prints again through a wider net of places that would be mad if they knew she knew how to call them.

The prints came back with a story she hated for how small it was. A trespass ticket from two years ago, south Steps, no less, a cop with a pen and a headache writing N. Harlan in the line where name lives and trying to make the H look like it might be a different letter later if a lawyer said it. A loss-prevention match from a big-box home store where someone had pocketed a fancy brush on a Tuesday and then paid for something he did not need to distract the camera, a clerk writing Nicolas H., thirty-two, average, had the kind of eyes that make people tell the truth and then hate him for it, the kind of note a woman writes when she’s trying not to get herself in trouble for seeing too much. A counselor note from a county intake never completed because Nick had decided to be fine and no one had insisted, the appointment marked maybe on a paper calendar, because some institutions still like to have something to erase. It wasn’t enough to put cuffs on yet. It was enough to put boots on and go knock.

Skye Delaney took the name like a stone in the teeth, rolled it, spit it out. She said Harlan like it meant fence and fencepost and fence that needs painting and a man who makes you hold the bucket because that means you love him. She pulled his old forms out of a folder because she keeps everything for the day she can use it to do good instead of letting it be ballast in her closet, and there it was, the smiling boy who had turned into a man with a coat everyone notices only when he takes it off. Nicolas Harlan, the Livery’s waiver signed in his precise hand, the line where it said I consent to be looked at filled in once and then again, darker, like a person practicing a signature they think they will need. In the emergency contact he had written Father and then crossed it out and written No one and then written Sorry and then left it, the word an orphan on a sad line. In the back, a note in Skye’s handwriting about the day he cried when she told him his work had intention but not risk, and how she had to sit with him for twenty minutes while he learned breathing again, in and out and not on the floor.

Skye Benning said the name and her eyes did a little hiding act before they stood still. She said he had never used Harlan in her lobby, but it fit his mouth in the way that made you believe him when you did not want to. She said he had the habit of reading pamphlets without flipping them over, like he wanted the promise without the footnotes. She pulled the lobby footage again because she likes to be accurate, and they watched him not look at the camera again, and then look right into it once, for one frame, and there was the thing Rhea liked to find in her machines and Dodge liked to find in men, the tiny movement that gave away intent. He knew the camera, and he knew how to love himself through it.

Quinn ran the name through everything he was allowed to touch and a few he wasn’t. Nicolas Geoff Harlan had a father in Sumner who still kept a landline and still answered it like a man in the seventies, the voice a shape you could put a face on right away, the kind that has taught boys to cut in without tape because tape is for men who never learned their hands. He had a mother who had left when he was fourteen and then died in Florida under palm trees that made promises tourists believe, a death that had nothing to do with him and everything and the obituary had been written by a cousin who signed it with three first names. He had a GED from a place that wore a different name now. He had two W-2s spread over six years, both seasonal, both cash-lighter than they should be. He had a parking ticket at a trailhead where people go to pretend their thighs will carry them out of their own lives. He had a mobile that changed every six months and a friend named Blue so often in his contacts that it was either a joke or a failed brand.

They went to Sumner because fathers are maps whether they want to be or not. The house was not the one Dodge had expected. It was not gone to hell or kept too clean; it was clean where the eye falls and dirty where the hand does, and the hand had been distracted. The porch had fresh paint in a color the catalog had called Barn Door and the real world called Blood That Behaved. A ladder leaned in a way that had gotten narrower with years of leaning. The man who opened the door wore old muscle like a coat with someone else’s name stitched into the collar. His forearms told a story about weight and repetition and the affection men take for their tools when their sons won’t speak to them.

“Harlan,” he said when she showed him the badge, like she had told him a last name he used to be proud of and now wasn’t. “He’s not here. He hasn’t been here since the last time he wanted to tell me I didn’t teach him enough and I told him to bring a wall and I’d show him. What do you want me to do. Cry on the porch.”

Dodge watched his mouth move and saw in it the way Nicolas’s mouth made the word sorry look like currency. “We want to know who taught him to paint without tape,” she said, and the corner of the man’s eye did a grim little dance that belonged to shame and rage and a third thing, pity.

“I taught him to do it right. I taught him to keep the edge and clean the brush and not waste what you can’t afford. I taught him to put rugs down because paint is a liar and it jumps. I taught him to take a breath at the top of a line and let your hand be the thing God made it and not the thing it becomes when you let the radio and the rent get inside it,” he said, and then he took a step back and let them in as if those words had required hospitality as payment. “I did not teach him to hurt nobody. He liked to be seen. He’d paint a wall and then he’d stand outside and stare at it longer than you had to to see if the edge was good. That’s not normal. But it’s not a crime. I told him normal and good aren’t the same thing and he told me shut up like a man who thinks news doesn’t apply to him.”

The living room had the tidy shabbiness of someone who lived mostly in the shed. On the wall were two pictures that wanted to be noticed and wouldn’t look at you straight on, one of a boy with a cast in eighth grade, messages scrawled in sharpie that had faded to the color of old gum, get better nick!! and you owe me $5 and a phone number someone hoped would survive the summer. The other a faded print of a farmhouse under snow from a calendar twelve years old that had been framed because the month had been good to them. The kitchen smelled like coffee done the way men who won’t admit to sugar do coffee. In the doorway to the hall a strip of painter’s tape had been left at a perfect right angle, and it would bother a man with this blood to see it and not peel it, so Dodge peeled it and he looked at her hand like he might like her finally.

“You hit him,” she said like she was talking about the weather, and the man had to take that sentence somewhere he put high on a shelf. He set his jaw like he was fitting a blade into a handle.

“I taught him to be a man,” he said. He looked at Quinn with a glance that asked this one over here, does he still say sir to anyone, and when Quinn didn’t flinch he dropped it and said: “I hit what was around. It was never about him. That’s a lie but it was the way I told it to myself so I could go to sleep. You going to arrest me for the nineties.”

“We’re going to ask for a picture of him when he wasn’t wearing paint,” she said, and softened because the sentence said more than it needed to. He got an album from the bedroom some woman had left a long time ago and turned pages with calloused thumbs, and there was the kid, freckles before he learned to stand. There was the teenager, sideways hat before he learned fashion is a way to apologize. There was the young man with a brush held wrong in a yard where grass had done its best with bad soil. Dodge took pictures with her phone because she has learned that things vanish even in your hands.

“He knows your house is honest,” she said at the door, because it might give the man something to do with his day other than fold himself inside his shed. “He uses your rules when he needs rules. He’s in Nashville and he’s painting boys for an audience and he thinks he has an argument that will make me forgive him.”

The man laughed and it sounded like a floorboard giving up. “He never learned to live with no,” he said. “We used to have a dog and that thing, you tell it no and it would save your life. He did not have that. You all right out there. You got a face like my mother’s when the hurricane was coming and the radio was too quiet.”

She thanked him for his porch and took the kind of breath you take before you drive away from a childhood, left or not, and she could feel Quinn looking at her profile because he’s a good partner and he knows when you need to be asked and when you don’t. Her phone buzzed before the turn out of the subdivision and Rhea’s name did what it always did, put energy into the part of her chest she was pretending had gone to lunch. The text said: sink print and hood print match our lobby boy and match your Livery handprint; N.H.’s partial from the Livery is your man; congratulations on catching art with art; also: partial latent on paint card from wall matches same, so he doesn’t wear gloves when he’s proud. I’m printing you a poster.

By noon the story had grown a head and three tails. The wall had its own hashtag and the city had a thinkpiece and a man with a podcast had called the turquoise the hue of modern alienation as if melancholy could be Pantone, and a mother group had written an open letter about boys and consent and paint and the way apology gets taught like a virtue. The captain’s press conference did the thing it needed, and anchored somewhere below it, the fact: the department was seeking a person of interest, Nicolas Geoff Harlan, thirty-two, average height, left-handed, old scar on the left thumb, associated with the Nashville arts community and the Vanderbilt campus, last seen near the pedestrian bridge downtown. He’d be live by the six o’clock, and by three a woman in Antioch called and said he once tried to sell her a painting in a parking lot and had apologized when she said she didn’t have cash in a way that made her feel like she’d stolen something. She had kept the card he wrote his number on because she kept everything and the number didn’t work anymore, but the loop on the y was a swallow, and Rhea pulled it into her nest and made it sing the same song as the others.

They went back to the Livery with a copy of the BOLO and the way the room went silent was a kindness. Skye stood with her arms full of herself like a person who knows which way she’s falling already but is going to pretend she can reconsider. She looked at the picture from the father’s album and let the boy turn into the man in front of her and bit her lip like she had been caught being wrong by a younger version of herself. She said she had a bench she let students build on and when they carved their names underneath, sometimes they carved other people’s names too, and she took them to the bench and flipped it and there was N.H. and there was the year and a little turquoise dot next to it like a seal. She gave Dodge a box with the sign-in sheets from those months and there, three weeks back, under Daniel Payne’s attempt at a signature that looked like he wanted to be taken seriously, was a line that had to be him, thin letters, precise, written with a pen that had gotten caught on the downstrokes, and next to it, in the place where kids write @names so they can find each other later, he had written: @maybeisyes. It didn’t exist anymore, the handle had been closed, but that was enough for Quinn to make a list of places it would have cached itself, for Rhea to click holes in a thing that had tried to be a shield.

When the lab got the shirt from the dryer under better light, they found a smear on the inside hem, the color not turquoise but the quiet pink of skin after someone presses too hard with anything. It could be Daniel. It could be anybody. They cut it out like a small wound and sent it to the place where DNA gets told to talk faster, and the woman there said she would call them by morning like she always does and she would probably be right sooner because she never sleeps when the city is playing at art.

The text came at four, not a map this time but a script. He sent her a picture of a room painted half in a turquoise that hurt a little if you stared, masking tape along the edge because he thought it would annoy her, the tape not even sticky because men like him don’t notice when old tape gives up. He wrote: Do you like it with tape. Tell me yes or no. He wrote: I have a place tonight. He wrote: You will come because you understand me. That last sentence made a curl of laughter rise up from something feral inside her, and she let it out in the car where no one else would be asked to keep it.

She wrote back a sentence that made Quinn cough and then nod when she showed him because he understood the need to make a man put his own words in his mouth. She wrote: I don’t understand you. I understand edges. He answered in eight seconds like a boy. He wrote: South steps. He wrote: Dark. He wrote: Bring light. He wrote: Bring your sorry.

They staged it like a play because everything with him had a stage and everyone with a badge knows how to use a theater when one’s offered. Patrol was invisible in the ways they train for and rarely succeed at, boots memorizing squeaks, radios turned down so the god voice in them doesn’t blow the part. Quinn tucked himself into a shadow he had decided belonged to him and the river made its old noise, the one she would hear in her bones long after she left this city for any amount of time. She wore her coat and her steady and a vest under the coat that felt like a liar’s handshake because it always has to be too tight to feel like it will save you. She stood where he had told her because you do that when you’re taught to be bait, and she didn’t have to pretend to breathe harder than she wanted; the body does that when you call it to work.

He came like all theatre people come, late enough to make you remember you wanted him and early enough to make you doubt yourself for doubt’s sake. He had cleaned up or he had borrowed clean from someone else; his coat had learned a new trick and the cap was gone and the hair was combed in the way men learn from other men in barracks or prisons or families. He held his hands in front of him, palms up, like he was coming to be searched and forgiven. He smiled the smile he had tried on in bathroom mirrors and on the glass of windows at night, and he said her name like he’d earned it.

“There are too many people at this party,” he said, like he was being chivalrous on behalf of his sake. “You brought a choir. I wanted a duet.”

“You wanted a stage,” she said. “This is the one I could keep clean for you.”

He looked at the stairs like they were listening. He had paint under one nail, a moon of it, stubborn. He put one hand on the rail, and the rail took its time, remembering everyone who’d done that before him, and Dodge saw the moment her father had prepared her for without meaning to—the point where a line wants to become a curve and the hand wants to show off. He had his back to the river, which is not intelligent if you plan on living. He had his mouth shaping something, maybe, sorry, soldier, he had all his little words and all his expensive paint and the edge of the step under his heel and for a second he thought he was the one who knew the choreography.

She said his name flat, the way you take color out of a wall, and it did a thing to his face you could only do with a word. He blinked and then didn’t, and two things happened in the same heartbeat: a man who had no business walking his dog that late came up the far steps with enough noise to startle sleep and a gull laughed itself mean over the water. Nicolas moved toward the sound with his shoulders, and Patterson from Patrol stepped because he was built of that, and Dodge said no in a tone of voice she had honed on men much bigger than this, and Nicolas ran because running is a language the body knows even when the head thinks it is speaking art.

He wasn’t fast the way television wants. He was efficient in the way boys who have run from houses are. He knew the weak slat in the fence by the fire lane and the alley where the trash bins tilt into shadows and the way you can flatten your ribs and become a page when a truck passes. Quinn was good and stayed good until he saw the way Nicolas used the curb to summon height and then he did the thing partners do—it stopped being about orders and started being about your own body knowing how to do what it was built for. He cut left. He ate air. He lost him for ten counts in a parking lot that belonged to a church and a night chef and then he saw the flash that wasn’t flash at all, the little flare of turquoise when a sleeve pulled up and Nicolas slapped his hand against a wall to turn and left the ghost of his pressure there.

Dodge did not run in a straight line. She ran the way water finds, hugging edges, looking for the place gravity was a rule and not a rumor. She saw him cut across a playground where the swing sets looked like gallows in the wrong light and into the mouth of a street that wanted to be a dead end and wasn’t, and then he was gone, but not, because the smell hung back like a man’s aftershave when he has failed to leave the room before you arrived. They stopped because stopping has to be allowed or you die in little inches, and she listened to the wind decide if it would tell on him. It didn’t. It blew cheap and mean up from the river and carried laughter from a bar and the sound of a train reminding the city that it’s always leaving.

On the playground, in the sand no one remembers to replace, at the base of the slide, was a paint chip the size of her thumbnail. She picked it up with the grim patience she had been taught and held it to her nose like a person prays, and it was him. It was the expensive stuff. It was the binder that dries too slow and makes the edge clean and the hand dirty. She pocketed it as a wrong kind of lucky token and straightened. Quinn stood beside her with his hands on his hips and his head down, breathing like a person who knows he still has stairs in him, and he let out a laugh he did not mean, the relieving kind, the why are we alive kind, the we will get him because he is not a god kind.

“Okay,” he said, and the word had on it all the miles and none of the brag. “So he wants to run. We can run. He wants a stage. We can change the lighting.”

They went back, reluctantly the way people leave a fight that isn’t over, and it was only on the walk that Dodge let the world come back in around her at the edges. The city was doing its wet shine thing. Men smoked and tossed the butts at storm drains like they could plug them with their bad habits. Women in coats walked in pairs with their arms looped through one another like they had invented that. Somewhere a trumpet made a fool out of a cheap song. Her phone lifted its head. Rhea again, which meant good news or science. Rhea had a picture of the index card from the wall blown up until the fibers of the paper looked like a landscape. She had circled a little speck at the corner and annotated like a teacher: ash from gum wrapper? minted. She wrote: our boy chews the same brand as the wad under the radiator; also, the blonde hair you pulled belongs to Skye Delaney or someone with her mitochondrial story; she gave me a sample and rolled her eyes; don’t read the second thing as bigger than it is; rooms share hair. Then, another text: DNA on the shirt hem is Daniel. Be kind when you write that down.

Dodge stood in the shadow of the precinct doorway with her phone brightening her face in a way she would punish in any other person and felt the shape of the thing in her hands. Not the case; the case was a house with too many additions and not enough foundations. The thing was the word he loved and the way the city used it and the way her mouth had been taught to carry it without biting down. She pictured him being eight and being told maybe about a Christmas tree and then told no when the check bounced and then told sorry when the lights didn’t work and then told say thank you anyway, and that would be too easy if you believed in that kind of narrative. Men are not made of one night. They are made of every time they didn’t get punched when they should have and every time they were kissed for saying they didn’t mean it and every time someone hung a wall in front of them and told them paint is a way to make weight look like a choice.

Quinn nudged her with his shoulder like a boy because sometimes you have to let the child part of yourself touch another person or you calcify. “You have thoughts,” he said, and it wasn’t a question.

“I hate his father for not believing in tape,” she said, and he laughed low and let it be worth more than it was. “He will do something bigger to be the thing the city talks about and he will do it where we can’t pretend not to look. He likes water and he likes steps and he likes walls and he likes being an average man walking into frame. He likes us more than he wants to. He will call again. He will call me, not you, not a tip line. He thinks we are in a drama where I have to understand him. He thinks this means I will forgive him when he tells me which day his mother left. He is wrong,” she said, and the last two words felt like a small warm stove you can put your hands over.

The captain had a mood for them back upstairs. Someone had made a nickname for this that she could not deal with yet and he threw it on the ground and stamped it. He asked what it would take to keep any body from being painted across the face of the river and she said floodlights and hubris and four more bodies nobody had paid for. He assigned them three uniforms who knew a stage from a street. He told her to sleep and she didn’t argue loudly; she would go home and lie down and watch the ceiling do its quiet job and make deals with herself about sugar and not answering calls and not thinking about tissue cards and then she would answer the call and think about the cards and eat Rhea’s donut she had saved in the desk drawer like a sin.

He texted at eleven like a boy who had been told to wait an hour after eating to swim and couldn’t. He wrote: That was fun. He sent nothing else. She did not answer because she respected the ancient magic of withholding. She fell asleep faster than she deserved to and dreamed that she had painted her throat bolts of turquoise and that men kept asking her to say maybe and she couldn’t because her mouth was a wall, and when she woke she was biting her lip and the cat had slept on her calves like a sandbag.

Her door buzzed at six like a rude morning. Colin was on the steps with a hoodie that said a school he didn’t go to and a face that had learned three new ways to carry a day’s worth of new weight. He held out a plastic storage bin like he had found it and didn’t want to own it any longer than he had to. Inside, alphabetized in the way of boys who have been told to be careful without instructions, were Daniel’s paintings, small ones done on paper cheap enough to fold, quick studies of wrists and necks and walls and the underside of elbows, shadows that didn’t pretend to be anything other than themselves. In the bottom, folded twice, a list, his tidy summer-school hand again, supply runs and names and a note to self: if he says maybe, ask him where the yes lives. The yes had never lived in that man and they had missed it or they had known it and thought they could invent it and either way they were in it now.

Colin cried and said he was sorry and then got angry and said he was tired of that word and then said it again because habits are harder to break than hearts. Dodge gave him the ugly truth in a soft voice, which is the only way to do it where it sticks without scarring. She told him they had a name and a half and a father and a wall and that they would now begin the part of the story where incompetence gets loud and luck gets greedy and a man learns what it feels like when a city says the smallest word it knows and means it.

On the way in, the river was a steel belt around the city’s belly and the morning had decided on hard blue like paint chips on a table. The wall, the turquoise one, had acquired a second line in the night, written in the hand of someone who couldn’t stand it anymore and needed to fight back with letters. Beneath HE SAID MAYBE some stranger had written in spray paint the color of asphalt warmed by August: I SAID NO. The city had found its chorus. Patrol had rolled their eyes and then kept the tape tight. A woman in a green beanie mouthed thank you to no one and walked on.

The phone rang on her desk before her computer could remember its password. He let her hear him breathe for a long enough count that she knew he had been practicing being calm. “You ran,” he said, as if she had been the one moving. “You smelled like old rain and metal and that made me want to tell you something good.”

“Tell me something useless,” she said, because that’s how you make men like him talk, you lower the bar to a place where they think they will trip over it in triumph and then they bring you something they didn’t mean to.

“Did you know turquoise is the stone people carry against the evil eye,” he said, smug with research and his own sense of being connected to older things. “It keeps bad looking at you. It keeps envy from chewing holes in your shirt. It’s why women wear it on their throats, so you don’t get caught there. I think that’s beautiful. Do you think that’s beautiful, soldier.”

“I think you read the little card in the case at the jewelry store,” she said, and he laughed, pleased with the picture of himself being both petty thief and poet. “Tell me where you keep the brushes you don’t like. Tell me where you put the color you hate.”

“I don’t keep what I hate,” he said. “I make it into something and then I leave it where someone else has to decide what to do with it. You do that too. You keep making me into something I am not and then you pretend you don’t have to own it. Listen. I’m telling you something good now. Tonight they have an art walk and girls in boots will drink wine out of plastic and people will pretend they are patron saints because they pointed at a wall and said nice and then bought a candle. I will be working. I will give you a front-row seat. Wear a coat,” he said, affectionate as a caution, and hung up before she could tell him she was already wearing it and had been for years.

She sat in the chair long enough to be a piece of furniture, then she stood because chairs make you soft. She told the captain they were going to the art walk and he said how many and she said all of them. She told Rhea to bring the kind of powder that makes bad plans visible and Rhea said she liked walking downtown on the city’s good nights because she could feel the power running under the sidewalk like a river that had decided to be useful. She told Quinn to buy a hat that would keep the drizzle out of his ears because he looked like a man who got an earache when he was a boy and never grew out of it. He told her she looked like she had decided to shoot him tonight and she told him she had decided not to.

By five, barricades made streets think they were safe. Trucks with ladders and lights blocked off corners for no reason other than to make a mood. Pops of generator noise stitched the air into squares. Children with parents who wanted them to be cultured and not poor walked holding hands so hard their arms got longer. A man on a soapbox preached against everything that was not his god and a woman sold ceramics with little holes in them to keep people honest. The Livery had a banner someone had painted with a broom and a hopeful mind. Skye stood in the doorway and did the work all women do when they are in charge of a thing in public, she greeted and counted and watched and wanted and pretended not to worry about the way several men lingered without an excuse. She saw Dodge and gave her a nod that said I will not let my kids die for your investigation and Dodge nodded back a language that said she didn’t plan to let anyone die for anything.

He didn’t show his face first. He left a handprint, on a utility box at hip height where drunks steady themselves, fingers in turquoise, the thumb at that little strange angle, fresh enough that the air carried the smell and a woman in a leather jacket smeared it with her handbag without noticing and said damn and then laughed because she loved herself for pretending not to care. He left a thin line on the curb, a clean line where curb met street, a stripe that would mean nothing to anyone who hadn’t stood in his room and watched him practice pressure. He left a word in the condensation of a window, breathed on, fingered in: almost. He left it over and over on different panes in different hands, his, or the hands he liked to make his. He was making her walk. He was making her look. He was making himself into a weather pattern.

“Southwest corner at Commerce,” Quinn said over the radio in a voice that had learned to leave yawns in two blocks back. “Man with average height and a cap we hate just put a bottle with tissue in it on a ledge. Not lit. Not a fire. A flower. That old trick. White roses wrapped in blue. He likes his craft stores.”

“Don’t spook him,” she said, and hated that it was true, that you have to not spook a man like this until he believes his act enough to hand you the bow. She walked instead of running because running makes crowds behave like schools of fish and then nothing is good again for an hour. She saw him from thirty feet and didn’t make it known that she had. He was taller and shorter as usual, and the average of him was the weapon. He had eyes that would look blue if you wanted them to and brown if you didn’t. He had a brush in his hand and he was using it on air, practicing strokes and letting the bristles kiss nothing, and the nothing kissed back. He stepped up on the low wall that kept a perfect child from rolling into a hedge, and he made something out of the night and his wrist.

He painted a boy’s face. Not Daniel’s. Not anyone she knew. He painted a face onto the blankness of a temporary construction scrim, huge strokes that were too sure for a drunk, not enough mistakes for a real artist with an audience. The face was a face you’d like, a face you’d tell to come in out of the rain. Over it, he wrote in the large hand kids learn when adults are watching: HE SAID MAYBE. Below it, in smaller letters, in a hand he made tender on purpose: It’s okay. I asked. The crowd murmured the way crowds do when they want to be part of a conversation. A teenager took a selfie with his tongue out and his friend’s hand on his neck in a way that pretended to be a joke.

Patrol shouldered and breathed. Quinn stepped into a place where the night light was all ankle bone and watched, gun not up, other hand making a shape in the air that said not yet. Dodge stood still the way she’d been trained, which is to say while every muscle begged to be used, and she said the man’s name because it worked when you said a dog’s name and it worked when you didn’t want it to. He turned his head like a fox who hears his own song.

“Don’t,” he said, but he said it like someone who was asking her to watch more, not like someone who expected obedience. “It’s not done. It’s not done when you stop liking it. It’s done when I—”

She closed the distance with a pardon me that belonged in a different room and put her hand on his brush hand just hard enough that the bristles squealed. He went still and the crowd did that small sound—oh—and a man at the edge with a camera decided whether to stand down or become a journalist. His skin was warm, and men are that, and it won’t save or convict them. He blinked once like a camera with a slow shutter and then faster because this is what you do when a woman touches you where you want to be in charge. She held until she could feel his pulse not just through his wrist but through the plastic handle of the brush, which is too intimate a thing to know about a stranger. She let go. She stepped back enough to be a cop again and not whoever that had been.

“Here’s your yes,” she said, and the word was a small sharp tool in her mouth. “I will say yes to arrest. Nicolas Geoff Harlan, you’re under arrest. We can recite the rest by the book or I can sing it.”

He smiled because he knew the book and songs and thought his role was written for him. He glanced past her shoulder like men do when they don’t want to show their hands. He shifted his weight on the wall like a boy who has done benches his whole life. He went left and Quinn was already there, the scarf somehow useful now as decoration if not defense, and the patrol officer with the good mother’s instincts put her hand out and took the brush in one smooth move like she had been handed things by men her whole life and learned finally how to accept them as evidence and not gifts. He tried to pivot and the crowd did that thing they do where nobody wants to be the person the story sticks to when it is over, they parted and they closed and they raised their phones like candles in old churches, and the river forgot its own name for a beat.

He ran. They ran. He went around the side of the box truck with the catering logo and down the gap between two galleries that used to be a life and now were a retail dream and a place you could buy a bag that would never go out of style and he hit a closed gate and it hit back. He climbed and his foot slipped and his wrist left a clean line of turquoise down the cheap paint of the gate and then he was over and he was gone into a back lot where men smoke and girls cry and brooms lean. Quinn went for the street because he knows to be a band, not a solo. Dodge went for the gap because she is built for it and hates it and does it anyway.

He had planned it. Of course he had. He had practice runs that had taught him how his breath sounds at the corner, how the light falls on the obliging puddle, how to slide under the lip of the dumpster without cutting his coat, how to keep his average height from being nothing by making himself into a shadow on the brick that nobody looks at until it moves. He had set a paint card on the ground like a trick coin. She didn’t step on it. She jumped it like a child playing at not getting lava on her shoes, and then she smiled because you have to take the small pleasures you can when a man has stolen as many of the bigger ones as he thinks he owns.

He went up a fire escape that hadn’t earned the name. She followed with a proficiency her knee protested and the badge on her chest reminded her why. He had a head start and that was the whole trick with lives like his. On the third landing, he stopped not because he was tired but because he wanted a picture. He turned and held his hands up again, palms, those paint-mapped machines, and he looked over her shoulder at the old city like a lover he was leaving and he said sorry like he had always said it, and she had so many places in her body that remembered that word she didn’t know where to put it anymore. She put it in the handcuff. She put one cuff on him and the metal did its precise, ancient whisper, and then somebody yelled in the street below because it was Friday and their own fight had come due, and Nicolas was a man who used noise like a lever. He jerked his wrist, her hand slipped through turquoise that had not made itself dry, he twisted, he put his shoulder into her collarbone like an apology, she swallowed air she hadn’t meant to, he went up one more flight and her body forgot what she had promised it about not running up stairs anymore.

On the roof, the city was a new platform he had built without permission and loved because of that fact. The river was a piano lid propped open. The wall with the turquoise could be seen if you stood on your toes. He made as if to bow. He made as if to jump. He had never wanted to be dead; he had wanted to see the look on a woman’s face when he made her believe he might. She told her gun to keep its mouth shut. She walked the last three yards like there was nothing left to break. He stepped back. His heel found nothing. He flinched like a fish. She grabbed his coat with a hand that had held the inside of a man’s ribcage once and felt the slick shine of expensive paint against cheap fabric and then he was weight, all the ordinary of him, and the two of them were a shape that from the street would look like something else, and the edge put its cold truth against her knuckles, and the river laughed.

They fell half a story and hit the next roof, an ugly little annex that didn’t know it was important until just then, and the way her body learned to fold under other bodies kept it from being worse. He tried to make himself a ghost and she introduced him to the idea of gravity with her knee across his clumsy beauty. She showed him a wrist lock in the kind of gentleness you learn in Army tents and women’s bathrooms and she put the second handcuff on him like you lower a curtain on a show that has outstayed. The sound the cuffs make when they are done right is not loud. It is a decision. It is a door closing on a room you don’t need to visit again. It is the sound she likes best when she is allowed to have favorites.

Patrol found their way up with the kind of delay that means they didn’t get paid enough to believe in themselves in buildings like this. Someone threw a rope in case anyone wanted theater. Quinn came around the lip of the annex with his scarf flung back dramatically like he might let himself have that, and he saw the two of them and his mouth did the truth and a joke at once. He said, “Good evening,” in that harmless way and bent and put his hand on Nicolas’s shoulder like he was checking the temperature of a roast. Nicolas lay there breathing like he had been told to practice and looking up at a sky that was not his and making a little smile just for himself like a man who understands that the stage goes dark and has practiced elsewhere.

“You good,” Quinn asked her, and she wanted to say yes in the way that meant forever and nothing and instead she nodded because her throat had decided to do a different job.

He looked up at the thing, the city, the edge they had not fallen from, and he let himself have his own metaphor just that once. “I don’t like rooftops,” he said. “Too much sky.”

They led him down stairs and into lights and into sound and into the habit men have of making other people look at them. He didn’t fight because fighting would make him ugly and he can’t stand that. He didn’t cry because crying is for rooms where women own the door. He watched Dodge as if they were still on the phone, as if the only people in the city were him and her and the river, and he mouthed a word when no one else was looking. Maybe. She shook her head. No. He smiled like a man who has been told he is adored and instead has learned he is alive.

When the room swallowed him, when the elevator’s polite ding cut the night into pieces and made sense of them, she leaned against a wall that wasn’t turquoise and let the cold of it climb her spine like a spine replenishing itself. The city breathed and people clapped because they had seen a show and were grateful even if they didn’t want to admit to that part. The wall down the block wore its sentence into moonlight and the second line, the one some stranger had written, glowed faint where paint can sometimes talk itself into luminescence. I SAID NO. She said it out loud with her mouth as if she had not been saying it her whole life already, and she listened to the sound of the smallest word in English make the kind of difference she had joined uniformed men and then deserted them to learn.

Back at the precinct, the ritual. Property forms and chain-of-custody and Rhea coming in with a grin like a pocketknife and taking things out of bags and putting them into their own new bags, better ones, where they’d be told their names and then called those names in court. The captain shook her hand and liked his own grip as always. The district AG sent a text without punctuation that might have been heart or eye-roll or both. Davenport asked if anybody wanted pizza and nobody wanted to say yes because it would look unprofessional and then they all said yes because they had no sugar left and donuts aren’t dinner.

She sat on the other side of the glass and watched him take in the room that had a table and two chairs and everything in it meant to make you think it’s an ordinary place to talk. He liked rooms like this because he thought he could decorate the air. He took his seat like a king sitting on a crate and folded his hands like someone had told him once that only the guilty cross their arms and he had believed them because men like him always think there are rules and they can find them in themselves. He looked straight at the mirror because you can’t not. He smiled mildly and practiced looking like he understood gravity. He had paint where you can’t get it unless you’re proud and careless at once, flecks on his ear, in the little whorl at the shell. His thumb again, that stubborn geometry, the scar that dreams up personality on its own.

Quinn went in first because Dodge made herself old-fashioned sometimes and let a man pretend he could be a good cop so he wouldn’t become a bad one. He did okay. He didn’t say his name first. He didn’t ask if he wanted water because offering men things gives them the wrong idea. He said, “You know why you’re here,” and Nicolas said, “Because you can’t catch an idea on tape,” and that got written down in the margin of the report with a small star next to it because it would sound good later in a courtroom on a podcast. He answered questions that didn’t matter with precision and walked around questions that did like a man who has learned to circle a thing when the only word he’s got is maybe. He said Daniel’s name with tenderness that made Dodge’s skin try out a new kind of crawl. He said sorry with a sincerity that would have fooled a kinder woman and an ambitious lawyer. He said soldier again, once, like he was checking to see if it still fit her.

When it was her turn she took the room into her mouth and made sure it knew who owned it. She put the card from the wall on the table and didn’t push it toward him and didn’t make a sound when his eyes flicked and stuck like there was glue and God in there. She set the brush down next to it. She laid the receipt from the art store in its sleeve. She kept the picture of his father’s front porch for later because mercy becomes weapon if you use it and she didn’t want to. She watched his face soften when she chose fact over theater. She put the pictures of Daniel’s text string in a row and left spaces between them so the silence could say what it needed. He made a sound then that wasn’t a laugh and wasn’t not, and she told herself to put that sound in a jar, label it, never let it out where it could make weather.

“You like the line more than the man,” she said, and he was so grateful to be understood in that small way that his shoulders came down two centimeters, the first honest thing he had done in a week except put a brush in a sink for her. “You like the part where the brush behaves under your hand more than the part where a person breathes. You think yes and no are the only colors and maybe is your mixing room. You take boys and you turn them into a medium and then you tell yourself that is mercy.”

“You see me,” he said, amazed like a child, insulted like a man.

“I see how much you need to be seen,” she said matter-of-fact. “Don’t get romantic. It’s ugly on you.”

He told his story because they always do. They have a version ready for when someone they respect asks the right shape of question and he thought she respected him because she hadn’t shot him off a roof. He told her about the art walk where a girl had asked him to put paint on her face and then said maybe and then laughed and then kissed a boy who wasn’t him and he had gone home and put his hand on his own mouth to remember what it felt like to be wanted and then taught himself how to make the line so clean he could live inside it. He told her about Skye, not the counselor, the other one, whose classroom smelled like black coffee and tired fabric and hope, who had said maybe as a way to say bring me something better than yourself and he had brought her the best color he had and she had said no, later, wait, not now, and it had made a country in him and he had moved there and given it a flag. He told her about the father and the ladder and the sound tape makes coming off paint and how satisfying that is and how if you can’t have that there are other sounds you can make that nearly replace it.

She didn’t give him the empathy he wanted now. She gave him paper. Forms. A pen. She gave him a box full of his own edges and told him to live there until a lawyer came to teach him other vocabulary. She let him waiver on a question she had no legal business asking because it would scratch the itch inside her he kept finding. She asked him if Danny had ever said no in a voice he could understand and he said he said maybe and I loved him for that, and she said thank you because that was the tiny admission that would turn into a rope later. She stood and left him the room as a consolation prize he didn’t deserve and made herself down the hall and held onto the railing outside until her breath learned a new song.

Outside the interview rooms, the precinct was tired. Davenport ate pizza with the careful fury of a man whose family is asleep in a house he pays for by ignoring them too many nights. Rhea came in with a list of what the brush would say for them in a judge’s light. The captain wrote an email that looked like a tree if you squinted and she knew it was to the mayor and the subject was not art. Quinn took off his scarf and used it as a pillow without shame, and the fabric made a little mountain under his head. The printer jammed like a small rebellion. The coffee laughed at everyone.

She texted Skye Delaney because she owed her that and because she didn’t want the news to be delivered to that woman by a screen she didn’t choose. Skye wrote back a sentence that could only have been written by someone who lived inside art and barely tolerated police: We will hold a critique for consent in the morning; you can come or you can send me that portion of your budget. She liked Skye for that square jaw in her words. She told Skye yes not because she had money but because yes is a tool when you can make it do small things.

On her way out into the kind of night that knows it will be replayed for all the wrong reasons, she walked past the evidence room and looked in because she is a superstitious animal and likes to say goodnight to the things that made her day livable. The brush sat in its bag like a small king without a throne. The paint cards made a fan she could have put her face behind and learned a little bit of who she still was. The turquoise bottle she’d bought sat in her own desk’s drawer where she’d left it, ridiculous and heavy and buckled in, and she considered throwing it away and considered drinking it and considered giving it to a child to make them messy and then shut the drawer because none of those solved anything.

Quinn walked her to her car because that is the stupid ritual you observe when you’ve almost died and didn’t. He kept his hands in his pockets because he is a boy in that way and because he didn’t want to make the shape of touch in the air where other eyes could call it something. He said, “You did good,” and she did not reject it because sometimes men get to say things that feel like blankets and it’s not insulting when they do. She said, “You didn’t get shot,” and he laughed the tired laugh again and said he was saving that for sweeps.

Her phone buzzed while the heater failed at its job. The number was new and it shouldn’t have been able to reach her and everything in her body that had finally sat down stood back up. She answered because she is obedient to her own rules. It wasn’t him. It was a mechanical voice that wanted to be human telling her there was a collect call from the county jail and did she accept the charges and the spite of the system made her say yes because the only thing worse than hearing him from there was wondering which fish he was going to feed with his words.

“Nicolas,” she said like she was telling a chair what it was.

“I thought of one more thing,” he said. “I forgot to tell you that I never liked turquoise.” He stopped because he needed the effect. He stopped because he thought it made him a poet. He stopped because this was the part where he tried to keep owning the brush. “I did it for you,” he said. “It looks good on your wrist.”

She hung up on him and put her head on the steering wheel like a woman who had just been asked to stay politely. She wiped at her skin and there was nothing there because she had washed it off hours ago, but the body keeps old paint. She drove home carefully because care is the only rebellion she had left that didn’t cost paperwork, and the city laid itself down beside her over the bridge with its lights and its old trains and its boys and its maybes and its small quiet beautiful nos, and she believed for one stretch of straight road that all of that had been enough to make this chapter end.10

The courthouse did its best impression of not being a church and failed the way marble always does when it’s asked to be neutral. Morning slid along banisters and decided to live for a minute on the long faces of portraits painted to look like men were large on a moral scale. The hallway had the strange hush of rooms full of people who have agreed to be quiet so the building will like them. Dodge stood with a coffee she didn’t drink and watched the little theater set pieces roll by: a public defender flipping a file with his thumb the way gamblers carry a deck, a bailiff whistling under her breath like she was trying to teach a tune to a stubborn dog, a mother in a coat two sizes too thin holding herself through the elbows so her hands wouldn’t go loose and break something.

Nicolas came in cuffed and averaged and did that thing, chin up enough to say he thought his neck was involved, eyes looking for the camera he could love. He had on the jailhouse orange that insists it is a joke until it isn’t, and under it he wore his ordinary, the posture of someone who has learned to keep the top half of his body charismatic while the bottom half learns escape routes. He caught her in the crowd and let his mouth turn a fraction, not a smile, more the private sign men make to each other when the joke is the room. She didn’t look away because not looking away was one of her flags, and anyway it didn’t give him anything he didn’t already believe he owned.

The judge wore her robe like it had been ironed into her at birth. She read the words they all knew she would read and made them sound like new because this is the work of people’s voices when the law gets itself into a room—repeat after me until the heat leaves it. The words had their narrow shoulders all in a row: second-degree murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, unlawful restraint. A whisper went through the gallery like mice testing a wall. The public defender leaned in to Nicolas and said something short, the shape in the air of don’t say soldier, don’t say art, say nothing at all, and Nicolas did not nod because nodding is what you do when you obey.

Bail was a theory and then it wasn’t. Denied because sometimes the city remembers itself. He looked back again, over the shoulders of the men who owned his wrists, and his mouth formed a word she didn’t let herself lip-read. Maybe, of course. Maybe he said sorry because the syllables move the same. The room breathed and moved on.

Outside, the cold had sharpened its teeth and bit in the place where the collar meets the neck because winter likes the weak seam. She put her shoulder against a column and watched a bicyclist pretend laws are for other kinds of wheels, and Quinn came up with a paper bag and a grin that had learned to show only the front row of his teeth. “Bagel,” he said, a man making peace offerings to a woman who didn’t eat when she needed to. “Skye’s thing is at ten. The kids are already posting about it like they invented critique and this time it matters. You coming.”

“I’m bringing my sorry,” she said dry, and he didn’t say don’t because there are times when men know better than to rescue you from your own line.

The Livery had dressed itself like a promise. They had put chairs in a circle that made room for someone indecisive, they had opened the high doors that let the light decide to be generous, they had brewed coffee in a machine that sounded like a freight train but delivered warmth like a midwife. On the chalkboard someone had written: CONSENT IS AN ART PRACTICE. Underneath, in small careful hand: and a policy. Skye moved through the room like she owned it and didn’t; she reached to touch shoulders without touching, tipped her chin at the shy ones so they would step into the light if they wanted it, saw Dodge in the doorway and gave that little flicker of a smile that says I see you seeing me and neither of us is here as a mascot.

They started with breathing because people always forget how when they’ve been spoken about. A boy with a glittered thumbnail said he’d never had a cop in a critique and did he have to speak differently. A girl with a shaved head said we’ll make the cop do the work and her smile took the sting out. Skye stood at the front and did not take the front; she took the role of the person who names the thing. “Maybe,” she said, the word pilling under her tongue like a sweater you love too hard, “is not a stage direction. If you’re working with bodies, yes is a sentence and it’s either present tense or it isn’t consent. We treat maybes as no until they arrive wearing a different coat.”

They passed around a box of index cards like communion. Each had a word printed and blank space under it. Sorry. Wait. Now. No. They wrote on their cards and then read, not to be graded but to let the air hold it. A sophomore who wore her dead grandmother’s ring like a knuckle said she had a bruise of turquoise under her nail still and she didn’t know how to feel about wanting to keep it. A boy with long hair and a mouth like a trouble song said he’d been asked to pose and he’d said maybe and then he’d said no and then he’d said sorry because men always want the last word and he was tired of keeping them company. A kid Dodge remembered from the wall—hat too big, coat thrifted into dignity—said he had painted with Nicolas two years ago and nothing bad happened and he still felt like he’d been walked to the edge of something and shown the view.

Skye held the room when it started to tilt. “We’re not Nuremberg,” she said, and the laugh that went through the circle made it back to her like gratitude. “We’re not tribunal. We’re learning how to ask and answer in a language that keeps our bodies ours. If police want to take notes, they do it without making a mess.” She looked at Dodge with kindness edged in steel. “You can stay without owning it. Or you can talk. Your choice.”

“I’m here to listen,” Dodge said, and kept her hands quiet on her knees. The room made a small sound at that because you can trust a woman who knows which part of the sentence to swallow.

After, the kids brought her a pile of names as if names were ransom and she was the kidnapper willing to bargain. Jae came up like a shadow making a decision. They had hair that didn’t tell you a pronoun and a voice that had learned how to be heard by forcing interesting onto it. “He asked me to be a second,” Jae said without preamble, eyes on a point over Dodge’s shoulder where a wall had learned to be looked at and not noticed. “Like a diving meet. Safety friend. He wanted me to hold, not to watch. I said yes and then I said no and then he said maybe like it’s a wet blanket you throw on a fire and I left because I like when rooms keep belonging to me when I go,” they added, almost cheerful with survival. “He’s been around. He’s built for other people’s edges. You have a list already, but I have his side doors. He goes in through supplies.”

“Supplies,” Dodge said, hearing in it all the synonyms—excuses, tools, love letters.

“He hangs around the aisle at the big box with the fancy wall paint, talks to people who hold their color cards too long,” Jae said. “He says things about undertones like he’s flirting with the idea of being useful. He offers to teach you to cut in freehand because tape is for girls and then he says he’s kidding and then he says sorry and buys you a cheap brush because he thinks poverty is a vaccine against future crime. He got your boy at the south steps, right. He likes stairs. It’s theater seating.”

They scribbled a map on the back of a handout for a ceramics sale, X marks the stupid places Nicolas had liked to hang his talent and wait for someone to costume it. Dodge folded it and put it in the side pocket where future becomes now. She left a note on Skye’s table that said thank you because it was a spell worth saying in rooms that teach and destroy in equal parts.

The captain called when the sunlight had decided to be unforgiving and had sent the dust in the Livery into frantic choreography. “Family notification,” he said, and there was apology in the back of his throat because a man like him will never not hate this part. “You should come. She asked for a woman when Davenport said ‘detective’ and he didn’t correct her. He couldn’t.”

Daniel’s mother lived in a house that was in a polite argument with its lawn. The winter had made a decision and the yard had not been allowed to have one. She had oranges in a bowl because that’s what mothers do in winter when they want the idea of sun inside their rooms. The couch had a throw blanket that tried too hard and a cat that didn’t, and the photo frames did the thing of only holding the moments you’d planned to live and didn’t. Davenport sat on a chair he looked too large for and held his hat in his lap like he was a boy in church who had been asked to behave his body.

She brought them tea without asking if they wanted it. She set the cups down on coasters that looked like little pieces of geography, cork islands against spill. She looked at Dodge like she might tell the truth if someone else did first. “They said you caught him,” she said, and her voice had the tone of someone talking on the phone while turning off burners. “They said it was on the news. That doesn’t make my boy less hard to look at when I close my eyes, so you know.”

“We caught the man we believe did this,” Dodge said, and she wished the English language had a tense for certainty that could still be kind. “The person who made Daniel stop.” She used his name like chalk on a blackboard, it held shape that way. “I am sorry. I will keep being sorry as long as it’s useful. If there is anything you want to know that doesn’t make you bleed, I will answer.”

The woman’s mouth made a small practical line and then a twist, and the twist was the hard part. “Was he alone,” she asked, and Davenport opened his mouth to fall into the scripted holes and Dodge put her hand on the coffee table not touching him, touching the wood, to say let me. “We don’t believe so,” she said. “We think he had help with logistics, not with intent. There are people who will need to live with their names for a while in ways they didn’t choose, and we are going to make that as small for them as we can.”

“Good,” the woman said, and then the porches of her face collapsed at once and she was suddenly younger and older. “He liked blue when he was little. He’d make the sky wrong and I’d say baby the sky isn’t that color and he’d say maybe it is in our neighborhood. I kept one of the pictures. It was on the fridge until the magnet got tired,” she said, and she made herself stand up to go get it because grief makes you get up for the strangest chores and obey. She came back with a paper that had lost its crisp and handed it over with pride like a mother hands a diploma. The sky was a wild wrong blue and the sun was a square and there were three figures at the bottom, two tall and one small, and the small had a smear between its shoulders like a wing. “I want to not hate that color forever,” she said. “You can’t help me do that, but I thought I’d say it out loud so God would have to hear me.”

She saw them out with the politeness women learn from being asked to be hospitable to their own hurt. On the porch, the wind took a run at Dodge’s knees and she let it because fighting the weather doesn’t make it less weather. Davenport stood on the walk and practiced a sentence into air he didn’t mean to say to anyone and then swallowed it and looked at her like a man who had carried a piano by himself up a flight of stairs and decided he could do it again if she asked.

Back at the building that was supposed to fix things, the phones had discovered more ways to ring, which is what happens when a face gets on television. A woman insisted she had been painted turquoise by her boyfriend as a surprise and that made him a suspect and then she cried because she wanted to confess that she had liked it, and someone wrote her info down in case liking could be used as evidence somewhere later. A boy with a voice that broke in two places said he had walked under the bridge and saw the bottle and thought it was pretty and took a picture and then felt like a murderer because beauty had talked to him, and she told him to email the photo anyway because beauty sometimes keeps the widest angle. A man from out in Dickson called to say he once tutored a Nicolas Harlan in GED math and he always did his edges too neat on graph paper and what did that mean about a soul.

They put Nicolas in a room with his public defender that smelled like state budget and sob stories, and he played with the paper cups like he was a child again. He wrote a letter that he couldn’t send because it wouldn’t help him and put it in his shoe because men do that; they like secrets that sweat. He called and asked for her and twice she didn’t answer and the third time she did because you can’t pretend a river isn’t on the far side of your house if you can hear it from the yard. “Why are you there,” he asked, as if she were the inmate. “You could come sit with me and look at the ceiling until the paint makes animals.”

“Because I have a cat,” she said, and it was true in the way that makes men angry because they want myth and you give them errands. “Because work expects me to finish what I start. Because not answering you is a choice I get to make.”

He was quiet long enough that she thought the call had already cut. “Do you wear the wristwatch on the left,” he asked finally, small as a boy invited to sit at the bar, and she hung up on him with all the relish she allowed herself and set her phone face down on the file that had learned how to get heavy.

Afternoon practiced being night on the faces of buildings and failed and practiced harder. A crew in city vests came to the wall with a power washer and a tarp and a man with a face that had forgotten how to hope, and three women in puffer coats stood in front of the turquoise sentence with their arms threaded like fabric, and Skye arrived with a bullhorn she hadn’t asked for and a speech she hadn’t written and a kind of authority that some people are born to and some people teach themselves. “We’re not saving a vandal,” she said to the men, who had learned to speak in clauses that contained liability. “We’re protecting a conversation.” They stood there breathing fog at each other until the man with the hose remembered his daughter’s braces bill and lowered the nozzle half an inch, and the women took a step forward the way people in small towns take pies to porches, and someone on the phone at City Hall said hold, hold, hold, and the wall stayed decorated. Below, someone had added a third line in marker that would not last the rain: WE ARE NOT YOUR CANVAS.

At her desk, the machine in Rhea’s hands turned the brush into a person with a social security number. “I’ve got your boy on the bristle,” she said, almost triumphant, and rolled her chair back to look at Dodge like a magician who still believes in science. “Eyelash, skin flakes if you like uglier words. Daniel is in the seam like a memory that has learned glue. He can talk for you from there. It’s not pretty and it’s exactly enough.”

“Good,” Dodge said, and let the good live in her mouth for a second longer than she’d meant. “We’re going to have to go farther back. If there are others, they might be living their lives not knowing they’re in a category. He said practice. He’s not good enough to have started at Danny.” She heard the sentence and the little spine of cruelty that runs along the top of the truth and she swallowed it because accuracy matters even when it’s an insult.

Rhea flipped through printouts with a finger that had a glitter of blood under the cuticle from a cutter and ignored it like lab people do. “I pulled five incidents with turquoise weirdness in them from the last three years that weren’t blamed on teens with time to burn,” she said. “Two were dismissed as prank art and one as a wellness check that didn’t need to be, and one is in your old friend Davenport’s pile from last spring when a boy walked into Saint A’s on Palm Sunday with blue paint under his collar and said he needed to confess something that wasn’t sin. He gave a name. It wasn’t Nicolas. It was a person who doesn’t exist unless you know where to look. Blue. Cute.”

“Blue shows up on his contact list,” Dodge said, and got the special little hit in her chest that feels like an elevator arriving at the right floor. “So we’re looking for a shade, not a person. A supplier, a second, somebody who likes being in the room when a man reminds himself he’s important. We find Blue and we find the corners he’s been practicing in.”

They went back into footage the way people go back into dreams they didn’t understand—hopeful, a little embarrassed. The lobby tape yielded small graces when you watched it with patience: a scuff of dye on the heel of a hand, a piece of tape stuck to a jeans cuff like a forgotten vote sticker, the little boxy bag you only see on men who carry tools and don’t call them that. They spotted the bag enough times that they made it a character and then followed the character through three corridors and two days, and eventually the bag hung from the chair in a coffee shop and the person attached to it attached to a face. Blue was not a color; Blue was a woman with a mouth full of secrets and a smile that had seen both sides of a church. She wore her dyed hair out of her eyes like she didn’t mind what you thought about her decisions and set a brush down beside her latte like a person who won’t pretend with you and then will.

They found her by the river because everyone does, and she rolled her eyes for so long that Dodge imagined it as a cardio routine. “Of course,” she said, when the badge came out, and her voice did a slalom around contempt and landed on bored. “He gets famous, I get visited. He’s a bowerbird at heart. He makes piles from other people’s shiny and calls it a nest. He liked me because I’m pretty on bad days and I don’t make a show of knowing it, and also because I have a brain that can categorize undertones in my sleep. He thought we were a match. I told him maybe and I meant no and he heard a lifestyle choice. You want coffee. It’s a day for paying for women’s time.”

They took the table that wobbled even when it promised not to and let Blue tell it in her order, which is how you get truths that stick. She had met him in the aisle near varnishes, of course, had laughed when he said tape is for people who don’t trust themselves and then had bought two rolls of tape. He’d shadowed her to the register and paid for a brush she didn’t need and she had let him because poverty is a language and because she believed in interest-free debts. He had asked her to bring a kit to a shoot, called it a shoot like that had authority, and she had gone because she does that; she goes places with her eyes open. “Do you think I’m stupid,” she asked, and when neither of them moved, she answered herself. “I’m not. I’m curious. That looks the same from a distance. He made the boy into color. The boy liked it. That’s true. He also made the boy into a wall to talk to and that’s not okay. That’s the part I got loud about. He didn’t ask me back because I wasn’t a mirror.”

“Do you have dates,” Quinn asked, making it into a small thing he could have in his hand. “Places. Anything we can pin.”

Blue smirked like a woman who has saved all the receipts of her life without meaning to. “He liked basements that used to be bars and rooms with one good window and churches on weekdays when the door’s open for the ghost of Jesus,” she said, and she ticked them off with her fingers, old names and new ones. “South steps always. A motel off Carroway that lets you do cash and not look you in the face. The Livery, before Skye told him to grow up and then smiled because she can do both. A house on Houston that used to be his father’s friend’s rental until his friend stopped being his father’s friend. Hey. He never paid me. That’s not your problem, but it’s the truth.”

“You left,” Dodge said, and watched the way Blue’s mouth filed that sentence under compliment with an option to appeal.

“I left when he asked me to hold the boy’s face still while he breathed through his nose and I said how about if we don’t, and he said maybe and then he said sorry so fast it sounded like a laugh,” she said. “He likes the part where he puts his hand on a man and calls it caution and then gets to remember later that he was necessary. Men have built entire religions that way. You going to put me on TV. Don’t. I don’t want to be the girl who says boys do this. I want to teach a class where girls don’t get in rooms where boys make them assistants for their crimes.”

When they stood to go she pulled a thing out of her bowerbird nest—a paint card with a greasy thumbprint in turquoise on the back and the name of the color circled on the front. It said Poolhall Kiss in a font that wanted to be flirtatious and there was an A next to it, approved by the only committee that mattered to him. “He left it under my sink because he thinks I clean the way he does. He’s bad at leaving no mark,” she said. “You know that. That’s why you like him. He’s an easy man to find if you stop pretending he’s a genius.”

Night arrived with its tray of old tricks and a new one he had built from inside a cell. A letter came on law office letterhead because he had learned that paper can be a key if you color inside the lines hard enough. It was folded with the care of a boy who still believed stationery can save you. Inside was a drawing on yellow legal paper in pencil—not turquoise, as if he wanted to prove he could operate in lack—a set of hands practicing a line, five strokes from fat to fine, the pressure map of a father’s kitchen. At the bottom he had written in a version of penmanship that had tried to be saintly and fallen into neat: This is how you were made. Do you forgive me yet.

She did not show it to anyone who would mistake it for a threat or an apology. She put it in the folder where she kept the outliers, the things that are going to matter late and then make you angry that you didn’t throw them away. She took Plank out of the bathroom sink where he liked to live because he imagined himself a fish and let him put his paw on the drawing as if that could baptize it into harmlessness. He yowled and she yowled back because talking to a cat is one of the safe kinds of madness.

She fell into sleep like a person learning the shallow end and dreamed of tape. In the dream, her father was alive and teaching tape, which is impossible because he hated it, and he showed her how to lay it so it would peel back without tearing the wall and he said you only get one clean, and she woke knowing more about tape than she had before and hating what that meant. The phone flashed once and did not ring, and she learned to read a light like a sentence.

The next day the city remembered that it had other crimes, other messes, other children to be gotten into school. Their case became an object you can set down if you have to wipe a counter, and she put it on the shelf carefully, not because she was done with it—she never would be—but because balance is not a suggestion; it is a tool you sharpen or it goes dull at the wrong time. Nicolas called twice and her voicemail took both messages and refused to translate them into text; some things are not made into transcripts without losing the temperature that matters. He left the word soldier the second time and then didn’t speak and left her with a minute of the sound of a man thinking he is a storm.

A kid with a scooter busted his lip in front of the precinct and bled onto the step where she had sat the week before thinking about the river. She took a napkin from her pocket like a mother in a pew and gave it to him and his mother said I’m sorry in a tone that sounded like I’m sorry for all of this, which is a lot for a city block to hold. In evidence, the brush sat while a chain of custody wrote itself into genealogy. The shirt hem swore harder that it knew who it had touched. The wall held its turquoise sentence like a bruise you have decided to live with so you can keep wearing dresses, and the second line, the angry one, the beautiful one, found cousins on three other walls in hands that weren’t his.

Quinn brought her a list of old cases that might love this one and she took it the way a woman takes a baby she didn’t ask to hold and then discovers she’s very good at. They knocked on doors that smelled of different kinds of poverty. They learned the names of boys who had been painted once and learned to scrub and kept their shame in corners that did not grow. They went to a church basement where an art therapy group had practiced being tender in a room with folding chairs and a coffee pot that burned everything it touched. A man there said he had been a canvas and liked it and then hadn’t, and that’s how he knew the difference between being adored and being arranged. He said sorry four times for saying it out loud and then laughed at himself until breathing was easier.

At lunch she saw Skye Benning on the steps of her building with a student sitting three inches too close because closeness is a drug you learn to take in doses, and Benning had her body arranged between the kid and the air like a gift and a wall at once. They talked without saying the parts that would make the talk too interesting. Skye told her she had a bookcase that was too full and that’s what it feels like sometimes inside a head like hers, and Dodge said she had a drawer that held a bottle of turquoise and she couldn’t decide if throwing it away would be a failure of nerves or an act of faith. “Keep it,” Skye said, and her face was not kind, it was exact. “Keep it and choose every morning whether to open the drawer. That’s the practice.”

It should have stayed simple then, which is to say the size of a man. But the world is not a drawer you get to close. On a Thursday that saw fit to be spring for two hours before it remembered itself, a body was found under a billboard that wanted her to buy a mattress. No paint. No lines. A girl who sold shoes found him and then folded in on herself and called no one and then called everyone, the way people find religion in steps. The boy’s face had been pressed into dirt and there were fingerprints of someone else’s hand on the back of his neck, ordinary prints, not art. He looked seventeen in the way numbers sweat for boys like that. The city inhaled and held it while it decided whether to blame the turquoise for all of it. “Copycat,” someone said in the hall in that way which is really wishful thinking dressed up as clever, and the captain’s mouth did the old-man thing and he told them to take their words to the parking lot and leave them running there.

Rhea came back from the scene with dirt under her nails and rage under her braid. “Not him,” she said, without turning it into a gift. “Not his hand. The pressure is wrong and the print says a different story. We can walk and chew gum. I just want the city not to make one man a tent to live under.”

She bought chapstick in the vending machine she never had change for because her mouth had decided it wanted a project. Back at her desk there was a drawing in her in-box, slid under the glass like an old school secret. A face in pencil, not the boy from the billboard, a different boy, the parts of a face you memorize first—eyes, mouth, the tilt of the cheek where you’d put your hand if you loved him—sketched with the light futility of someone practicing being gentle. Underneath, in a hand that looked ten and thirty at once: He said yes. She sat with it longer than was strategic because there’s strategy and then there’s being a person.

They processed Nicolas’s room again because if there is a place where a man keeps the keys he hands out to other people’s houses, you go back armed with a new idea. Under the floorboard that had learned to creak at footsteps and keep secrets, Quinn found a envelope with a Catholic church’s name on it that wasn’t the one he’d used for practice. Inside were five Polaroids from last winter, boys with paint on their shoulders like shawls, smiles in the complicated register between you and a camera and a person you want to be proud of you. Behind one, in a careful hand, he had written a date and that word—maybe—and beneath it in smaller script that wanted to be innocent: sorry for the mess. They bagged it all because paper is as loyal as you teach it to be. Her hands smelled like dust for two hours and she let them because there are worse perfumes.

Toward evening, when the city decides whether to be gentle or showy and usually splits itself badly between the two, she drove to the south steps because people are allowed to haunt places the way the dead do. The river had its Wednesday outfit on even though it wasn’t Wednesday, steel and moving and uninterested in being beautiful for her. She stood in the place where she had nearly fallen and listened to the voices that pick up their own echoes. A woman in a red hat came and stood at the top of the steps and didn’t sit. She said to no one, “If I could do it over,” and then laughed at herself because grief turns us all into theatre people practicing our lines.

“Do you forgive him yet,” Quinn asked later, in the stupid little kitchen area that always smelled like soup that had decided against itself.

“No,” she said, and let the joy be in the fact of having it to say. “I don’t plan to. Forgiveness is a color nobody gets to buy at a store.”

“And the paint,” he said, because he is a boy who likes endings to have props in them.

“It stays in the drawer,” she said. “Every morning, I’ll decide. Sometimes I will open it. Sometimes I will leave it alone. Either way it will be mine, not his.”

He nodded and put the sugar in his tea like he always does, too much for a man who wants to be serious, and she watched his hand and liked him for the way it didn’t shake. The building creaked because it is old, and the printer hiccuped because it is poorly made, and the floor grille rattled because it is attached to the air that keeps them all from noticing the small deaths they suffer daily. The phone breathed in her pocket and she didn’t pull it out. The city exhaled. On the wall, under the turquoise and the asphalt and the small handwriting, someone had added in chalk, chalk that will go away with the next honest rain: WE PRACTICE YES WHEN WE MEAN IT.

That night he called and the line put his breath in her ear like a hand. He didn’t say soldier. He said her name the way the cat says food. “They’re going to forget me soon,” he said softly, like he was recommending a playlist. “You’ll let them.”

“Try me,” she said, even softer, and he waited for her to fill the silence. She held it. He hung up because he had nothing left that would keep his act from getting old and that is the worst thing to men who live on attention, worse than handcuffs, worse than rooms with chairs that don’t move, worse than ceilings.

In the morning she drove out of her way to avoid all bridges because a petty private logic told her this was how you keep men in cages from walking through your head. She fed Plank and left the cupboard with its dot closed. She went to the wall with a cloth in her pocket and touched it to the turquoise and then didn’t wipe, didn’t correct, just pressed and lifted and left a print not of her hand but of the cloth. Maybe is a word with a hundred lives; she would not bury it but she would stop giving it citizenship everywhere. She walked back into her building with her feet loud on purpose and took her seat. The day bent its back and went to work, which is the only prayer she believes in when the rest of the city is practicing being art.
