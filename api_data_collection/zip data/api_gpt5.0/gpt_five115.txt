At dawn the river was a long vein of light stitched through the ribs of the city. From the palace by the low bend of the Pasig, where mangroves reached their old hands into the water, Princess Amihan woke to the clatter of tricycles on the far road and the hymn of vendors whose voices were a kind of weather. “Tahooo!” drifted over the wall, then “Pandesal! Mainit!” and a dog answered like a bell with legs. She had slept badly, again. Dreams kept snagging at her mind like water hyacinths—strange fish wearing crowns, a shadow with a thousand noses, a school that was not a school, a boat that flew. She sat up, hair tangled, the mosquito net a pale cathedral above her, and listened for the old rhythm of the river. It sounded, as it always did, like her own blood.

“Your Highness, gising na,” Yaya Minang called, knocking twice and then not waiting to be invited, as was the custom of people who had raised you since you were a bean. Yaya Minang was small and strong and had eyes that could catch a lie with two fingers. She entered carrying a tray of champorado and tuyo, the smell both sweet and salt and memory.

“It’s Saturday,” Amihan said, which was a kingdom-law way of saying no lessons, no feasts, no ribbon-cuttings, and if she wanted—if she dared—she could go down to the river in ordinary jeans.

“All the more reason to start it well,” Yaya said, setting the tray at the foot of the bed and opening the curtains. Morning spilled in: a pale sun like a peeled lanzones, already beginning to cook. On the water, a heron stood on one leg, thinking long thoughts, and a varnished banca slid by like a black fingernail.

The palace of Pasig was not a palace as the foreign movies showed it. No golden gates wide enough for an elephant herd; no chandelier so large it made the air kneel. It was a sprawling bahay na bato, wings added and added again across generations until it had the generous, slightly tired disarray of a beloved aunt’s house. There was a narrow shrine in the hall where old warding jars kept the river calm in storms. There were carved steps worn smooth by bare feet and slippers. There were rooms that opened to arcs of veranda where the city’s murmurs came and went like tides. The dynasty of Pasig was not a dynasty, either, if you asked Amihan; it was more a stewardship. Her mother, Regina Luningning, took the crown like a fisherman takes a net: a useful thing that sometimes cut your hands. Her father, once Mateo of Kapasigan, wore it like a hat that didn’t quite fit; he was happiest checking flood pumps or drinking coffee with barangay captains round a folding table.

“Five minutes more,” Amihan murmur-requested, but she was already lifting the bowl, stirring the thick rice porridge, watching the chocolate swirl into its own weather. When she ate, she felt the life of the river come back into her limbs. She was never ungrateful for that. There were girls her age— sixteen and brave and loud— whose mornings were buses and jeepneys and marching in shoes bought on sale. There were girls whose mothers had fallen asleep with their heads on sewing machines. And there was she, sleeping under mosquito net lace that had absorbed a century of lullabies. What do you do with that? You try. You go down to the water.

After breakfast she didn’t plead; she simply packed a small bag with an apple and a tangle of string and the bronze fish-hook her grandfather had left her, slipped on a faded shirt and an old pair of canvas sneakers with one pink lace and one white, and slid past the portraits in the hall with her eyes down so their painted ancestors wouldn’t catch her and ask questions like “Where is your embroidered saya?” and “Are you walking without your guard again?” She took the back path through the garden where the santan grew and the butterflies insisted on being pieces of sunlight. She stepped through the gate, which recognized her touch and opened with a whisper that resembled sugar falling.

Outside, the world smelled like diesel, frying garlic, damp leaves. Jeepneys trilled, horns and chrome and the names of saints flicked across the heat. She kept her head down and her stride steady, waving to Manong Romy who sold isaw, to Aling Pet who always had extra calamansi for her. Nobody bowed, which was how she preferred it; in her old cap and shirt she was simply a neighbor’s niece. The river called, low and deep.

The water wasn’t clean. Some mornings it wore an oil sheen like bad makeup, and sometimes boys dove anyway, laughing. It had given the city everything and then taken back so much in anger. Amihan loved it regardless in that irrational way that love insists on. Her family’s work— her work, when the day came—was the old work of treaties with currents and debt to tides, of reading the moods of the water like a father’s face.

She squatted near the embankment and threaded the bronze hook with a length of the string, not to fish but to have something in her hands. She whispered a greeting the way her grandmother had taught her, “Magandang umaga po,” to the ripples of elders and children that hid under the surface. And something answered. A shadow moved under the skin of the river, then a round head popped up, eyes like coins, whiskers briefly combing the air.

“Magandang umaga din,” said Dado, the river’s resident tilapia king, who had appointed himself king without waiting for any election night in the drizzle. He did not speak to everyone, only to those the river had marked with its wet thumbprint. “Your hair is a nest, Prinsesa.”

“You’re giving compliments now?” Amihan said, flipping water with her fingers.

“Flattery is cheap.” Dado wiggled his fins and considered the sky. “But the river is restless today. You’ll have news.”

“What kind of news?”

“The kind that arrives folded.”

He disappeared, leaving bubbles and a small stray note of concern behind. Amihan frowned. There were many kinds of folded in the kingdom: folded letters, folded boats, folded fans that hid the eyes of a woman who knew too much.

She didn’t have to wait long. From the direction of the bay, against logic and current, a little paper boat came gliding up the river, as if pulled by a thread tied to a cloud. It was white and crisp, edges sharp like a new shirt. There was a seal on it, wax the color of jackfruit, pressed with a sign she didn’t recognize at first: a stylized tree with roots like veins, branches like capillaries. The boat bumped the wet stone wall below her hand, stopped obligingly, and waited like a puppy.

She should have called for a guard. She should have brought it to her mother with a polite note. Instead she plucked it out of the water, set it on her palm, felt it tick-tick with small magic. The seal was still warm.

She broke it, and the boat unfolded itself into a letter that smelled faintly of guava leaves and rain.

Princess Amihan of Pasig, said the ink, written in a hand both old and impatient. By right of river and by witness of mangrove, we extend to you an invitation to study at the Balete Institute of the River and Sky. Our classrooms tilt with tides. Our teachers do not stay in one skin. Our doors open wherever old roots meet water. We have watched you speak to the current. We have tasted how the flood drew back for you last summer when you asked it to be kinder. We have underlined your breath. The Balete Institute opens only to those with rivers in their blood. We are not a polite school; we are not a safe one. We are necessary.

If you accept, fold this letter again at dusk, in the shape you found it, and place it on the oldest water you can reach. Bring only what you cannot bear to leave. You will be met by a boatman who is sometimes man, sometimes boat. He owes us six favors and one debt.

The term begins on the seventh rain from now.

There was no signature, only a small blot where the pen had been lifted and the wax seal reaffixed itself like a second thought.

Amihan sat very still while sun lit her knuckles with its used gold. The world continued with its squabbles: traffic arguing with itself, a child on a bicycle chattering to an invisible friend, the clang of a pan. The letter felt heavier than ink. Her heart knocked once, hard, as if someone had rapped on the inside of her ribs and said, Halika, tara.

She had heard of the Balete Institute the way one hears of old islands under the current chart. There were rumors any time a storm behaved as if it could hear. There was talk in the market when an egret landed on a fire hydrant and refused to leave, as if perched at a window only it could see. Years ago a cousin of a cousin had gone, returning three seasons later with hair streaked the color of driftwood and a small scar in the shape of a leaf. He refused to say what he had learned. He knew how to find sweet water under houses that were thirsty. He knew how to read the warnings in clouds, which were a language that would never apologize for its syntax.

“Ah,” said Dado, poking up at her elbow again like he’d never left. “So. They noticed you.”

“Did they notice me, or did they notice the river and I just happened to be sitting beside it?”

“Do you want me to answer as a fish or a philosopher?” Dado’s eye rolled toward the letter. “The boat will come either way.”

“It says the seventh rain,” she murmured. “What if it doesn’t rain? What if we have seven days of sun and then an earthquake?”

“Then it will count some other way. Schools are very clever at making counts that favor them.”

Amihan folded the letter back along the crease it had kindly kept. The paper shivered like something pleased to be itself again. She slipped it into her bag, over the apple, under the string, as if it were an ordinary paper, as if it were a grocery list. Then she stood and the day seemed to tilt toward her hands.

Her mother was in the hall with the jars. Each jar held a thing that looked like water and was not water, a remembrance of a flood, the hush of a drought. The queen’s fingers stroked the sky-blue glaze the way you soothe a child’s fever. She was not adorned. She wore a plain white blouse with embroidery like wind, a skirt the color of afternoon. Her crown was a modest ring of hammered tin, worn only at the backs of her eyeballs where no one could see it.

“Nanay,” Amihan said. She had learned, in the course of being raised by three women with sharp minds and two men who were sometimes soft enough to be safe, that it was best to begin announcements with the truth. “I received a letter. From a… school.”

“A school?” Her mother glanced at the open front door as if one might walk through it. Her mouth attempted not to twitch into a smile. Her daughter’s desire for elsewhere was a familiar guest. “From where? We weren’t expecting schedules from any of the usual suspects.”

“Not from the usual suspects,” Amihan said. She took the letter out and set it on the table like an offering.

The queen did not touch it immediately. She circled it with her gaze as if it were a bowl of hot soup. Then she leaned close and breathed in. “Guava,” she said, surprised. “Rain.”

“It’s Balete,” Amihan breathed. “They want— They invited—”

“Let me see.” In the way of those who had grown up with letters forged by good men and bad, she held it to the light to see if the ink was lemon or blood, if the watermark was an animal that only showed its face in heat. The tree was a tree no matter how she tilted it.

“Mateo,” she called, and her father appeared with a paint-smudge on his forearm because he had been supervising repairs on a wood rail and done some of the work himself, much to the dismay of the staff who liked him better when he sat quietly and signed things. He smelled like sawdust and paint thinner and the greener hidden note that always clung to him when he returned from checking on the pumps.

“Ah,” he said, reading, and halfway through he whistled and then stopped because it echoed too sharply against the jars. “Well,” he concluded. “Have they no enrollment forms to fill? A photocopy of a baptismal? A lack of formalities is either honest or arrogant.”

“They are never polite,” said Lola Eusebia, who had been quietly napping in the chair by the window, a shawl puddled around her like a sleepy river. She woke when the letter crossed the threshold; her old eyes were always watching even when the lids frowned. “Balete never says please and never says sorry. Like a tree that has eaten a monastery.”

“They taught you?” the queen asked. When she asked this she was asking a hundred years of things, because her grandmother had been—once—like a rumor on two legs.

“They did not teach me, but they taught women I loved. Not because they were kind. Because the world needed them to know.” Lola’s mouth creased into a smile that showed three teeth and a memory. “The mangrove wants you, apo.”

The word moved through Amihan like a boat’s shadow under a bridge. “I haven’t said yes.”

“You said yes when you were eight and you argued with the river and it argued back,” her grandmother said. “You said yes when you cut your foot on a bottle and refused to let the water taste your blood because you said it would want more. The river respects a child who thinks ahead. You think ahead more than you imagine.”

“I could say no.”

“You could,” said her mother, and the room shifted briefly around that possibility, like a lizard flicking its tail. “You can always say no, hija. A queen who cannot say no is no queen at all. So. We will not press you.”

“We will also not pretend we don’t want you to go,” her father said, blunt as a coconut. “It’s strange to want the thing that scares you. But I want you to learn what they can teach you so you can come back here and frighten the floods into behaving. I am tired of keeping sand in bags. I want to hand them to a daughter and watch the water back up, embarrassed, and say, Hoy, sorry po.”

“Mateo,” the queen murmured, smiling despite her eyes, which worried at the edges like a seamstress examining a hem.

“And it won’t be forever,” Lola said in a tone that meant it might be forever. She took Amihan’s hand, turned it palm up, as if reading lines. “You must bring an anting-anting. Not one of your grandfather’s silly brass suns that impress only boys. A true amulet is earned, not bought. Do not buy from a man with too many teeth.”

“I have the hook.” Amihan touched the string where it lay cool in her pocket. The hook had never bent even when she tried to open a tin with it and Yaya scolded her with words that made the air blush. “And—may I take my sneakers? The ones that have been with me through the flood that surprised us. The river knows them.”

“‘Bring only what you cannot bear to leave,’” her father quoted, lifting a brow. “I suppose those shoes qualify.”

Her mother was quiet, and then said, “Only on one condition.”

Amihan looked up.

“You do not go as a beggar. You go as a princess of Pasig. That does not mean a parade. It means your chin knows how to hold your skull even when people try to take it from you. It means you remember that when you speak to the river you speak to me and to your Lola and to every vendor who believed and to every child who will never be a princess and still is. When you listen to teachers, you listen with the same stubbornness that keeps our city afloat. Do you understand?”

“Yes, Nanay,” Amihan said, and the yes was real, like a stone.

They didn’t throw a feast. They packed quietly. Lola Eusebia went to the small altar where the house kept its old secrets, opened a drawer that stuck, took out a tiny envelope made of banana leaf, tied with hair. “This is an old thing,” she told her apo. “If you swallow it you will be able to breathe water for as long as it takes for a prayer to climb a ladder. Don’t waste it on foolishness. Don’t let a boy with a guitar talk you into trying it at a party.” She tucked it into the inside pocket of the faded denim jacket that had once belonged to Amihan’s cousin who moved to Dubai and never returned. They added a piece of chalk, because chalk is serious. They added a thin knife carved from carabao horn whose sheath had lost its thong and been replaced with string. They added a tiny notebook with three pages of recipes: sinigang, guinataan, tinola. “You feed people,” Yaya Minang said, wiping her eyes as if chopping onions. “Even spirits like a proper snack.”

In the late afternoon a rumor ran down the river: that a princess from a land of cheese had been seen at the harbor, her hair rolled into a cloud like butter, her retinue wheeling crates that made wheels squeal as if they were alive. “She smelled like a bakery and a barn,” said a man who claimed to have seen her up close, while buying cigarettes and a memory. “Not bad, but… something.” The market hummed. Who brings cheese to Manila? Who brings a smell as their flag?

“Intriguing,” said the queen. “I had heard the Duchy of Affinage was sending someone to the Institute as well this term. Those islands train their children as if taste and scent were weapons.”

“They are,” said Lola. “Cheese is alive even when it is dying. It remembers.”

Amihan laughed and then sobered, pressing the folded boat against her heart. “Will she be a friend?” she asked. The question entered the room and leaned against the doorframe like a third person in on a joke.

“Maybe,” said her mother. “Maybe she will be nothing to you at all. Or maybe she will be the person whose name you say with your teeth tight.” Then she added, because she saw the worry tap tap in Amihan’s throat, “You are not required to be friends with everyone. You are not required to fight everyone. You may choose.”

The seventh rain came like a correction. The day had been threatening for hours, clouds huge and heavy, the sky all bruise. Then a line of water opened and walked across the city. It was a good rain, not violent, a teacher’s rain. It held out its hand and the heat gave it a curtsey. It rinsed the dust off leaves and left the world smelling like new bowls.

At dusk they went to the oldest water they could reach: a pocket of river behind the church that had miraculously avoided the concrete’s hunger, where an old balete tree leaned over like a lola peeking at her grandchildren. The tree had been pruned a hundred times but always insisted on itself, dropping long aerial roots like sentences that refused to end. The priests had tolerated it as one tolerates a family member who is not quite proper but is always present at weddings with a well-timed cough. Candles had been lit in alcoves, their small flames shivering. The rain had almost ceased. It gathered in leaves like coins.

Amihan knelt at the water’s edge. She unfolded the letter, felt its silent breath, refolded it exactly as it had instructed, into a boat with a perfect crease. She whispered, “Yes,” in a voice that belonged to every age she had ever been. She placed the boat on the surface, and for a moment it was merely a child’s paper. Then the river recognized the seal. The boat took a respectful little inhalation. It began to move, not outward but deeper, as if it were sailing into the idea of water.

“Balete will send what it owes,” Lola said.

They did not wait long. The boatman arrived like a comma. First there was a shadow under the roots, then the shadow had a nose, then a face, then a vessel slid out— a banca of old wood and something like bone, its planks stitched with fiber that was not any plant in Pasig and also was. Standing in it: a person with a skin the color of low tide, hair braided with bits of dried leaf, eyes that had seen so many rivers they had settled into a color that wasn’t any one of them. He had a mouth like a smile that would show itself once and then close again like a secret.

“Princess of Pasig,” he said, and bowed without making it seem like bowing was a favor. “The Institute remembers your river. Do you come?”

“I come,” Amihan said, and her voice did not break. But her fingers went cold, which seemed honest.

“Bring only what you cannot bear to leave,” the boatman reminded.

“I’ve done that,” she said, patting her jacket pocket— the packet, the notebook— and looking down at her left foot. The sneaker looked back, stubborn and worn.

“May I hug you like a person?” her father asked, the way he’d always asked since she turned thirteen and her body demanded consent even of kin. She nodded. His arms folded her up and the smell of paint thinner and afternoon sunk into her hair.

“Write,” her mother said, pressing a clean handkerchief into her hand as if it were a letter opener for the world. “Write even when there is nothing to tell. The nothing is the most important part.”

“I’ll write,” Amihan promised, and then to her grandmother: “I will not use the amulet foolishly.”

“Then you will live,” Lola said. “Take the river with you. Not just the power. The people. They will be heavy, but you are strong.”

She put one foot into the boat. It moved as if breathing. The boatman’s eyebrows lifted, amused, as if he had expected her to hesitate longer. When her second foot lifted, there was a whiff of something else, strange and layered, floating under the peppermint freshness of the rain. A smell like rind and cellars and pale fat. It threaded through the candles. It made the boatman twitch.

“Do you smell that?” Amihan asked, half giggle, half defense.

“I do,” said the boatman, nose scrunching with memories that were not his own. “The other invitation has been accepted. From across the water there will come a girl with her own weather. She will arrive by a route that tastes like salt aged in wood. Don’t mind it. Or mind it. I don’t tell students what to mind. I only tell them that the river remembers.”

“And cheese?” asked her father suddenly, unable to keep to the long dignity of farewells. “Does the river remember cheese?”

“Rivers remember all things they are given,” the boatman said solemnly. “It is the forgiving that is the trick.” He untied the line— which was not a rope but a vine— and gave the banca the subtlest push.

They slid forward. The world changed from here to there, which was all a change ever is. The city leaned back. The balete tree closed its eyes, content with its own long shadow.

Above the usual smells, the little bitter ghosts of diesel and skin and stew, came again that cheese-smell: not unpleasant but insistent, announcing itself like a person at the door with a cake. Amihan looked back involuntarily, and for a moment she thought she saw on the embankment, beyond the candles and under an umbrella as wide as a small sky, a girl in a dress the color of old cream. Even from a distance, even through rain, there was a shimmer around her like heat. Her posture was perfect, too perfect, as if balanced on invisible wheels. She did not wave. She looked in the direction of the river and smiled a small private smile, like someone who had already read the next chapter of a book. Then the banca turned a corner that was not a corner but a decision, and Amihan lost sight of her.

“Tell me your nam—” Amihan began, and then caught herself; name-exchange had rules in the river.

“You may call me Palapaw when I am a boat,” the boatman said. “When I am a man, you may call me Pala. It means nothing. It means everything. Don’t get smart with it.”

She grinned despite herself. “I wouldn’t.”

“You will,” he murmured. “All of you do.” He tapped the side of the banca and the wood thrummed like a throat singing, and they moved faster, the banks smearing into a watercolor of low walls, damp plants, evenings with other people.

“Is it far?” she asked after a while, because city distance is different from river distance.

“Yes,” he said, and then, because kindness and accuracy seldom marry, he added, “No.”

“I’ll keep watch,” she said. “Against whirlpools. Against sudden frogs falling from the sky.”

“You watch for the thing you fear and you miss the thing that wants to be your friend,” he said, not chiding, just speaking to the air between them. “But watch. Watching is never bad.”

She took to the watching as she took to everything she had decided to. The last of the rain jeweled the surface, tiny crowns. The boat moved by its own argument with the water. When the city’s sounds thinned to threads, when even the scolding of a balete fruit bat sounded far and blessedly annoyed, Palapaw began to sing low, in his boat voice. It was the chanting that keeps the planks remembering they were once a tree, the sutures smooth. He sang of roots that drink secrets and branches that tickle lightning. He sang of girls who stepped on paper boats that held their weight like promises.

Amihan leaned into the song and let the river do the remembering. The smell of cheese did not go with them. It stayed behind like a promise that needed aging.

They passed under bridges that did not exist for anyone else. One was a spine of bones belonging to an animal that had never breathed. One was a shadow thrown by nothing in particular. One was a line of egrets standing wingtip to wingtip, pretending hard to be a solid thing. Under each, the water changed its mind.

“Do you know why they invited you?” Pala asked toward midnight, when the river widened briefly into a place that sighed like a sleeping whale.

“Because I asked the flood to be kind,” she answered. “But anyone would ask, in a panic—with… with their voice like that.”

“Many ask. Few are heard. Fewer are answered. And fewer still are able to answer back without becoming a god. Do not become a god, Prinsesa. We need fewer gods. We need more river-sisters whose hands don’t shake when they measure the world and then say to it, Please.”

“I won’t be a god,” Amihan said, and the vow set down in her body like a root in good mud.

“Good. Then sleep. I’ll wake you when the moon drops her earring.”

She didn’t think she would be able to, but she did. The boat had the kindness of a well-behaved dog. It let her back curl and her head find a knot in the wood that fit her skull. She dreamed of the cheese-girl, though she told herself not to. In the dream the girl had seven shadows and each was a different scent. One was milk just before it turned. One was butter on bread. One was something older, caves and patience and wanting. They smiled at each other as if they had both lost a coin and found a river.

When Pala woke her, the moon had indeed dropped something bright and foolish in the water and was pretending not to notice. The air was cool like a peeled cucumber. Ahead, the silhouette of a great tree rose, not merely rising but proposing itself, like an argument in perfect grammar.

“There,” Pala said. “The Institute.”

At first she saw only a tree so wide seven men could not have held it. Then she saw the doors. They weren’t doors the way a room has doors; they were breaks in the space between roots where the dark had been taught to curve. She saw light that was not lantern and not LED. She heard voices: some human, some theoretical. She heard laughter—tentative, then not. She felt the pivot in her sternum that comes when the world is about to split into before and after, and you are the quiet knife.

And then, just before they slipped between two roots and the river became school, the wind carried a thin thread of scent that had come a very long way— unexpected and oddly sure of itself. It edged around her ear and said, whether in perfume or curse she could not know, See you.

Amihan smiled into the dark, into her own pulse. “See you,” she whispered to nothing and everything, and the boat carried her inside.The river narrowed as if it did not wish to be caught looking at what the balete had made of itself. At first there was only the feeling in the stomach like the last step of a staircase you thought had one more, a small delicious disaster, and then wood began to speak in a language that used creak and sigh and the occasional polite groan. The roots towered like a choir of knuckles. They had not been cut to make space for doors; doors had been taught, patiently, to live where they had never lived before. Light fell in panes and ribbons, in puddles that were not water but remembered it, and hanging from some of the higher branches were lanterns whose flames were enclosed in shells, the nacre throwing their small gossip onto the undersides of leaves.

The boat touched something that felt like a threshold and became, abruptly, obedient to the Institute. Pala’s jaw loosened as if an old tooth had decided, finally, to forgive him. He did not look younger, but he looked less like a promise unpaid.

“You’re about to be greeted by the Registrar,” he said, adjusting the knot of the braid behind his ear as if it were a watch he needed to set. “She likes stories and dislikes coins. Do not give her any coin. She’ll eat it out of politeness and then be cross for three days.” His eyes went to the bronze hook at Amihan’s hip, not asking, taking inventory the way rivers do.

“Do registrars at your schools bite?” Amihan whispered, because it seemed right to lower one’s voice in the presence of a tree that had hidden more than most churches.

“Only if you give them the wrong names,” Pala said, and then he leaned forward and tapped the prow twice with two fingertips, a farewell that sounded like rain. The banca slid into a basin edged with root and stone and things that had at various times been one or the other. A platform waited, made of wood polished by soles and paws and the occasional belly. It had no railing but somehow did not need one. The air smelled like damp pencil shavings and tea. Underneath, the river continued going about its business, which tonight involved ferrying a configuration of moonlight that had decided to pretend to be a fish for a quarter of an hour.

A woman stood at the edge of the platform, but also a bird, and also something like the long soft spine of a fern. She was tall and also not tall; every time Amihan blinked her shoulders settled into a slightly different set of shoulders, as if she were selecting from a wardrobe of selves and liked too many to choose. Her hair was the dry brown of old root bark and was pinned up with what, on closer inspection, were the smallest of the Institute’s keys and a single thorn so black it swallowed a bit of light. Around her throat hung a necklace of mismatched buttons, each punched with its single hole right through the center, an invitation to thread.

“Child of Pasig,” the woman said, voice like a swallow stooping to drink, and even though there were several ways she might have known, Amihan felt the small flare of being seen by someone who did not need to guess. “Welcome. We were listening for your yes.” She did not demand a bow. She did not offer a hand. She inclined her head the way two bridges inclining toward each other would, if bridges had manners. “I am the Registrar when there is registering to be done. When there is not, I am a few other things. Tonight, I am the one who takes what you bring and gives you a place to sleep. In return you will offer us something to remember you by, so you can leave some part of yourself where it can be looked after while the rest of you goes and gets into trouble.”

“I can pay with a story?” Amihan said, voice steady despite the tremor that climbed her from ankle to rib like a vine.

“You can pay with a story that is not a lie and not yet finished,” the woman said, pleased that the child had listened to Pala’s first warning without making the mistake of thinking it covered everything. “Or with a song that is not borrowed. Or with a breath that you caught when you should not have been able to catch it. We take recipes, properly annotated. We do not take coins. We do not take promises. We do not take teeth. Teeth belong to those who lost them.”

Pala’s mouth crooked, and he lifted one bare foot into the boat as if it were a turning page. “I owe you six favors and one debt,” he told the Registrar, and this time his voice was the boat’s voice and not the man’s. “Let one favor be this: I brought her without the river sulking.”

“The river sulks for sport,” the Registrar said dryly. “Your favor will be tallied.” She slid her gaze back to Amihan. “What have you brought that you cannot bear to leave?”

“My grandmother’s breath wrapped in banana leaf, for when the water forgets I am not fish,” Amihan answered, and the Registrar’s eyebrows tilted as if remembering a morning with that particular old woman and a plate of cassava cake where the sugar burnt a little and improved everything.

“And with what will you pay?” the Registrar asked, gentler now because the square of a banana leaf tied with hair has its own dignity and it knows when it is seen.

Amihan reached into her jacket and took out the small notebook Yaya had slipped there. The paper was already worn at the edges, softly furry from being touched by kitchen hands. She opened to the first page and found her grandmother’s guinataan recipe, written in a hand that tilted to the left like the wind in July. “A recipe that fed my mother when she was too tired to say what she needed,” she said, the words choosing their own way out. “A recipe that hides sweetness under coconut so the day thinks it has won. It isn’t very grand. It does not have tricks. But if you do it right the spoon stands and everyone talks at once.”

The Registrar put out a palm. Her skin was like the underside of a leaf, cool and faintly veined. “Guinataan travels well,” she said. “It looks like something simple when it is a net for the drowned.” She made herself very still while she turned the page with two fingers, reading with her breath and not her eyes, as if those could betray her. “We will keep this safe. You may borrow it back when you are homesick. If you lose it, the tree will grow you another, but you will have to feed the ants who write the inks and they are greedy.”

Something let go in Amihan’s chest. She had not realized how afraid she had been of losing even that little book until she was allowed to put it down.

“And a breath?” the Registrar asked, because greed runs in bureaucracies no matter what they are made of. “Do you have a breath you caught when you should not have?”

“I have the one from the day the flood came heavier than July and I shouldn’t have been able to stop my cousin’s cat from slipping off our roof. I put the breath in my cheek and spoke it out like a push,” she said, surprised again at herself. “It got under the cat and under the water and convinced the water that cats are a kind of leaf that should be carried to trees.”

The Registrar’s grin split her face wide and young. For a moment she was a teenager with scraped knees and a pencil tucked behind one ear. “I am trying not to like you yet,” she said, confiding as if they were both secretaries and the tree was their ill-tempered boss. “It tends to cause grief.” She closed the notebook and slipped it into a slit in the wood that hadn’t been there. The slit swallowed it the way birds swallow small stones, intentional and necessary.

“Come, then,” she said, when she had finished pretending not to be charmed. “The root will remember your feet better if you step on it with the seriousness you reserve for first and last times. The first rule is not to feed the tree with your fear. It eats other things. The second rule is to ask if a door wants to be a door before you try to persuade it. The third rule is that no list of rules will save you.”

“I will make other lists, then,” Amihan said, keeping her voice light so the seriousness would slide under it like a pillar in water. “I am good at lists.”

“Good,” the Registrar said, in a way that made good sound like a tool. “You will sleep in the Estuary House. For those who stand in two places and do not apologize for it.” She turned and began to walk, and the walk was a kind of argument with gravity that gravity kept losing in small, embarrassed ways. Pala made the huff a boat makes when it knows it has to go be a boat elsewhere; he caught Amihan’s eye to say goodbye without saddling her with it.

“Thank you,” she said to him, and he shrugged one shoulder as if it had developed a memory of favors owed and was tired of itself.

“Keep your feet wet,” he said, and then put one hand flat on the prow. The vessel lifted its front like a cat arching and slid backward into dark as if polite darkness had come to collect it.

The way toward the Estuary House spiraled around and then down and then up again, a slalom between buttresses that rose like the thighs of giants. The air was full of the movements of small things that did not bother to be seen. There were students ahead and behind, alone and in pairs, carrying their nothings and someones the way one carries eggs. Some wore city clothes, frayed in the right places and stubborn in the thread. Some wore woven skirts with patterns that seemed to shift when looked at too long. One boy had an eel around his wrist like a bracelet, well-mannered and sleek, keeping itself from drying out by the sheer concentration of wanting to. A small girl with hair in four tight knots carried a jar with the word grandmother scratched on its lid and spoke to it with the respect one reserves for tidal charts and doctors.

“Do not wander into the crown unless invited,” the Registrar said, as if continuing a conversation someone else had been having with her. “It is not that you will fall. Falling is honest. The crown likes to move horizontal distances mysteriously, and then days later vertical ones very clearly.”

“What will invite us?” a boy asked from behind them, voice carefully not shaking.

“Assignments. Storms. Luck,” the Registrar said, counting them on her knuckles and then a fourth, invisible one. “Also the great myna who lives near the southern fork. He’s a gossip and he needs audiences. He will say anything if you give him a peanut. Do not give him a peanut.”

“What if he says something useful?” Amihan asked, and the Registrar laughed softly, the sound like a silk blouse being folded.

“Useful things rarely come from mouths. They prefer to be written by knees and stomachs.”

They came to a courtyard that was a wound in the tree where light had decided to camp. It had a floor made of slices of trunk so old their rings had forgotten the numbers. Water passed through underneath with a sound like someone humming while stirring something that required attention but not worry. Doors opened away from the courtyard in pairs, and above each was hung a sign that appeared to everyone as the shape of something they already loved. For a boy who had been a shepherd, it was a bell with no clapper. For a girl from a northern lake, it was the shadow of a fish with its mouth open. For Amihan, it was a thread of string wrapped around a stick, the kind her grandfather had used when the river was being asked to behave like a playmate and not an employer.

“This is yours,” the Registrar said, stopping before a door whose wood had gone silver with the years and then taken a step past silver into something else. Relief fluttered through the room like a moth let loose when they entered; it was as if the space had been holding its breath waiting to be a room and not just air with guesses. There were eight sleeping platforms along the walls, low and wide, woven mats rolled tight at the edges like snails, a shelf for each person carved with a small deep notch that could hold a thing the size of a ring or a folded note or a thimble. At the far end, a window looked out onto a thickness of green in which a dozen fireflies had decided to practice punctuation.

“You will have seven roommates. They will be bearable and sometimes unbearable. You will love some of them and tolerate others and one may save your life and you will argue with her about soap,” the Registrar said, utterly matter-of-fact. “Every evening the house is oiled with coconut so the roots do not complain. Do not be tempted to taste the oil. It is very old and full of memories. You will become sticky with other people’s troubles.”

“Do people steal?” a voice near the door asked, small and sharp together. A girl stood there with her arms full of something wrapped in cheesecloth, which would have been funny even if she had not smelled like the rumor of a cellar. She wore a dress that would have made sense at a market if the market were in a country that salted clouds. Her hair was braided cleanly down her back and tied with a ribbon the precise shade of the rind of Manchego. Her shoes were practical and unscarred. She had a square little chin that spoke of conversations that had ended because she decided they should.

“They borrow until they realize they have stolen, and then they confess or they don’t. The tree remembers either way,” the Registrar said. She did not greet the girl by name. She did not ask how the girl had arrived. The fact of her was a fact, like a new letter added to the alphabet by a committee of birds. Somewhere else in the tree, someone laughed, and somewhere else someone cried quietly, and the Institute went on like a patient animal learning another heartbeat.

“Put your salt away,” the Registrar added kindly but with a precision that suggested she could smell the shape of things under cloth. “This is a place where salt is a language and not a weapon.”

The cheese-girl, if that is what she was and if she permitted the hyphen, tightened her arms slightly without seeming to. For a second she and Amihan met eyes across the call of mats and shelves and the small business of arriving. There was no spark, in the way stories like to report, no jolt like stepping on a live wire. There was instead an odd small bow of recognition as if each owned a bird that had nodded to the other’s bird once, years ago, in a tree neither of them had seen. The scent that had haunted Amihan up the river unfurled with better manners here, less aggressive and more intent. It had lows and highs, a laugh at the back, a grainy patience at the tongue’s edge.

“I am called Ines by my grandmother and something else by those who have fashioned me into an heirloom,” the girl said into the space between them, the way one presents a slice on a board. Her accent curled through the air like a ribbon trying to tie itself to a baluster that had no interest. “I am from the islands where we age our milk and our grief in caves.”

“I know of your islands,” the Registrar said. “You hang blue bottles to keep sleep from escaping at night.” She smiled at their faces and at what would be difficult between them and what would be lovely. “You may lay your burdens down. Then you will go with me to the Commons and pretend you are not exhausted while you listen to a speech by someone who believes speeches are boats. If you are the sort who faints when your words touch you too hard, sit near the back. The House Wives sweep every hour but it takes them a moment to find the fainted.”

“I do not faint,” Ines said, not proud, simply stating a custom her body had.

“I do not faint either,” said the eel-boy from earlier, who had somehow slipped into the room unnoticed, which happens more often to boys who wish to be seen as men. “I leak, sometimes.” He held up his wrist and the eel waved its snoot solemnly.

“I have been known to sit down suddenly,” offered a girl with hair cut to wise ears, and the room inhaled the way a room does when it realizes everyone came with their own ways to fall.

Amihan slid her bag onto the shelf that had not been there a blink ago. She touched the chalk in her pocket and then, because a thing is there to be used and because Yaya understood more than she said, she drew a small square on the floor near her sleeping platform. It wasn’t elaborate, just a box with three lines that meant stay and a fourth that meant come back if you go anyway. The chalk left a thin moon of white on her fingertip. The notch in the shelf got her bronze hook. The hook nested there with satisfaction, as if it had been expecting to be asked to hold that particular corner of her.

“Commons,” the Registrar reminded, and, like water finding a descending stair, they arranged themselves into a group that looked less like a line and more like a promise. The Commons were bigger than any room had a right to be and also comfortably smaller. Their edges were not edges so much as the places where people tended to stand when unwilling to commit to sitting. The ceiling was too high to be a ceiling and too thoughtful to be sky. Hammocks were slung in odd corners as if someone had looked up, gotten bored, and put a bed there. A woman whose hair was a hurricane braided tight in apology carried two tureens that steamed in a way that did not announce what was inside, possibly because it changed. A long table grew itself by another leaf when three late students came in and then quietly subtracted that leaf when those same three stepped out, embarrassed at having been tricked by a root that insisted on being the floor.

At the far end, up three steps that had been carved with the words of a lullaby in a language older than gossip, stood an old man who was no younger than sleeping on a mat and no older than tin roofs. He wore a jacket that had been mended so many times it was mostly mends and therefore stronger than it had ever been. His eyes were river color when the river held the sky hostage for an hour and then forgot why. When he spoke, his voice carried without bullying the air.

“Welcome,” he said, and that was all for a long moment, because the word had to move through all the trunks of the Institute and be answered by all the places that considered themselves doors. He closed his eyes briefly and let the response climb into him like a cat that has decided your lap is the best place in the house. “Welcome to a place that remembers you before you recognize yourself. You have left mothers and fathers and streets that have worn your feet to their own comfort. You have come into a house that will change the way you count. We do not have age here in the way that timekeepers prefer. We have waters and we have skies. We have the fall and the rise. We will ask you to learn both.”

He did not tell them his name. He did not tell them his title. He did not claim to run the Institute. He spoke instead of bargains.

“You have bargains you have made with yourselves,” he said. “Some of you have said, I will never, and those always always grow seeds in their pockets when you are not looking. Some of you have said, I will always, and those crack like plates when set on tables that are not theirs. We respect your bargains. We will also test them. We will ask the wind if it can carry them and the river if it can refuse them. You will be afraid. You will be dismissed by something you respect. You will be loved by something you cannot quite trust yet. If you do not want to be changed, you may still leave by the door that is not laughing. It is easier, I promise you, to leave now than later, and we will not follow you home or shame your house. We will keep the seat you warmed warm for the next child.”

A few faces stiffened. A few hands tightened over bags. The eel around the boy’s wrist made a motion like seeing snow for the first time and not believing it would continue to fall. No one stood. Somewhere behind them Ines shifted her weight minutely and the scent of aged milk took on the note of a cave learning to breathe someone else’s air.

“The first of you to leave usually surprises us,” the old man said, and smiled with his left eye as if it were a coin he kept for such occasions. “We will also feed you, because philosophy is an indulgence unless given with soup.” He lifted one palm and the hurricane-haired woman tipped both tureens at once, and steam rose in a shape that briefly resembled a map of islands no one had yet visited. The smell that slid through the room was honest and complicated. It reminded Amihan of afternoons when the river chose to be flirtatious and not grand, of the way Yaya salted first with her thumb and then with her laugh.

They ate, not in lines but in eddies. The bowls were made of something that did not break but would flinch if you spoke sharply to it. The soup changed, not wildly, but intimately. For some it became munggo in the way of a grandmother who believes in your bones; for others it turned into a broth that had known fish and let them go. For Ines it became something with potatoes and a sorrow the texture of flour. For the eel-boy it was plain water with heat and gratitude. For Amihan it shifted between tinola and something like rain on the tongue, and she did not try to decide which she liked. She held her bowl in two hands the way the city taught her to hold dangerous hope.

By the time her bowl was scraped clean, her head felt both light and heavy, a contradiction she was beginning to see the use of. Egrets flapped somewhere near the far wall and when she turned her head she realized the far wall had decided briefly to be near because someone had needed it. A carved post turned its face to watch them and then, sheepish at being caught, returned to pretending to be wood.

“Tomorrow you will be sorted,” the old man told them, after the scraping and the low moans of full people had subsided. “Not into houses. We do not have houses that fight each other. We have work. The river will try your wrists. The sky will try your eyes. You will be asked to carry water without spilling and to spill what should be carried. Do not be clever. Cleverness is a cart and the Institute is mostly stairs.”

“What if we fall?” asked a boy who had not spoken yet, his neck long with worry.

“You will fall. Sometimes we will catch you. Sometimes the ground will.” The old man looked at the hurricane-haired woman, who looked at a nail above her head where someone had hung a mushroom to dry, and the mushroom, made wise by its slow growing, refused to be an omen. “We do not keep students who prefer to be broken. We repair what wishes to be repaired and we compost the rest. Do not be dramatic. It wastes blood.”

A pulse of laughter rolled around the room because he had used the word compost without apology and because fear likes to show its teeth and be mistaken for humor. The speech wove itself down and then stopped as cleanly as if cut. Students were sent to sleep by handfuls. The hurricane-haired woman collected bowls like she was collecting stories to tell her kettle. The Registrar stood by the door that wished to be the door, counting without counting.

On the way back to the Estuary House, the tree had the decency to creak in a way that made the inside of the body identify itself and settle. Ines walked beside Amihan because they were going to the same door and because the corridor made you want witnesses. They passed a cluster of boys arguing about whether the moon had ears. They passed a small shrine with an offering of salt and half a mango, the other half nowhere to be seen because someone had needed to be brave and had put it in their mouth. A long centipede with a tuft of red hair on the third of its too many backs crossed in front of them. Ines stepped over it carefully without saying a word. Amihan watched it and thought about red hair and whether Chenelyn from the market had ever kept three secrets tied with a ribbon of the same color.

“Estuary,” Ines breathed, tasting the word as if it were a new cheese washed with a spirit she had not used before. “It is a name of two things meeting and not dying.”

“It is a place that pretends to be one thing until you get close enough to be fooled by it, and then it is honest,” Amihan said. “In Pasig, we call that being a politician. The good kind.” She was rewarded with the side of Ines’ mouth softening, a smile that did not have to be protected by teeth.

“You were born where the river has too many lovers,” Ines said. “It makes you… vivid,” and then, as if alarmed by her own compliment, she quickened her step for two beats and then slowed again so it did not look like running.

They reached the room and found that the fireflies had negotiated a truce with the dark and were arranging commas near the ceiling. Someone had placed a bowl of water by the door and whispered to it until the surface went thick like an eye. On the edge of each sleeping platform lay a small thing that had not been there: a chip of shell the green of a promise, a fragment of bone carved with lines too tiny to see and therefore most insistent, a feather that had not made up its mind between white and grey. On Amihan’s mat sat a seed, dark and glossy, whose cap had been gnawed by some bird that believed in beginnings. When she picked it up, the seed warmed in her palm as if remembering a pocket it had once lived in.

“For you,” said a voice that belonged to neither friend nor root, and when she looked she could not see its owner. The Institute did not mind that. It liked to give, sometimes without being thanked, because not all economies required that kind of ledger.

Sleep arrived without asking permission. It took off her shoes with better manners than she had shown it. It slid the denim jacket under her head exactly the way Yaya would have done. It did not pull the mosquito net down over her even though there was one, because mosquitoes here had been given other work to do shredding old shadows into mulch. Bodies settled. Breaths spoke to each other through thin walls. Someone far away plucked a stringed instrument invented by a fisherman with a broken paddle and made the entire tree vibrate in sympathy.

Before leaving herself to the kind of rest that would go on working even when she wasn’t, Amihan took the handkerchief her mother had given her and wrote carefully at the edge of her mind. Nanay, they fed us a soup that knew too much. I paid with guinataan. The Registrar knew the smell of our kitchen. I met a girl who smells like a conversation that has been kept in a wooden cave for a long time. She is sharper than she looks and more careful than she needs to be. The tree is a city that forgot to pave. I am trying to be a good guest and also a brave thief of knowledge. I did not cry. Tell Lola the banana leaf rustled when we arrived like it was approving of my shoes.

She did not speak the words out loud because the room was full of ears that had borrowed other bodies. She did not send them either, because she did not yet know where to find the post that did not pretend to be a vine, and also because it felt right to let them age a day like a new cheese. She tucked the seed into the notch near the hook so the two could argue gently in the night about what to be proud of. She covered the chalk square with her heel just enough to smudge its edges, which was what you did when you wanted the edges to learn they had to grow back by themselves.

When she closed her eyes, something outside the window leaned its weight against the dark and was recognized. A wind came through with salted fingers and touched hair and forehead and the soft part where worry lives. A thread of scent from far away—rind and peat and patience and the sweet sourness of cows eating grass that had looked at the sea for too long—reached for her and realized the room was full of other things to smell and drew back, decorous. On the brink of sleep, the questions that had been doing push-ups in the back of her mind took off their shoes and lay down beside her without telling her what they had trained for.

In the hour when even the egrets think better of rehearsing their exits, a ripple ran through the Estuary House. It was not made by wind or by root or by the turning of an old hinge finally remembering its duty. It was made by a voice that was not a voice and by water that had climbed up out of its basin because someone had taught it to. It was brief and it was not unkind. It passed under her dreams and lifted one corner as if making sure the hem was sewn right, and then it went on its way to the next place that needed to be checked. Somewhere, under the first bark and above the last whisper, the Institute made a note in a ledger no one would ever see. The night held. The boatman floated on his own errands between banks no human eye could measure. The river pressed its cold thumb to the Institute’s pulse and found it steady, for now, and went to find the moon’s lost earring, because it is in a river’s nature to keep returning things to what thinks it owns them.Dawn did not so much arrive at the Institute as renew a lease. Light filtered in sideways through the gaps of roots and leaves and decisions, and in the Estuary House it climbed up the mats and the sleeping bodies the way a cat takes possession of whatever space your feet have been foolish enough to leave. Amihan woke to the soft murmurs of people who were attempting to be quiet the way a river attempts to pretend it is not moving: unconvincingly but with charm. Someone on the far side of the room had already braided her hair; the plait tapped a rhythm on the floor as she shucked sleep off her shoulders. The smell of something simmering crept into the room like a rumor that had remembered to wash. It was not soup and not tea; it had the patient sweetness of rice becoming porridge, with something green tucked into it to keep it from growing too pleased with itself.

She rolled to a sit and found that the seed she had tucked into the notch with the hook had swollen with night. It had not cracked; that would have been too easy. It had simply made it known, by the shine it wore, that it had considered options. When she held it in her palm and tilted her hand, the seed rolled with purpose to the side where her thumb connected to her wrist and settled as if this were the sort of geography it preferred. “Good morning,” she told it, because it seemed proper, and then she told the room the same, and then the room told her: that there had been a bat that tried to hang itself from the idea of the ceiling and failed, that someone dreamed a storm that would be written down in a book of examples because it had the good manners to arrive on time, that the eel-boy’s eel had decided at four in the morning to make a bid for independence and had been persuaded to stay by a saucer of thought and a stern look from a girl whose ears were wiser than her age.

Ines sat at the edge of her mat with her bundle of cheeses unwrapped to the night-air and then wrapped again in a way that suggested she was used to appeasing living things that did not admit they liked being appeased. The cloth was damp with its own breath. She had slept on her side, one hand under her cheek, the gesture making her look briefly like a younger version of herself who had been promised something and was not entirely sure she wanted it anymore. When she looked up and caught Amihan’s glance, she smiled with two corners and then smoothed her face into competence. “Do you think they will make us swim?” she asked, and the word swim did something to the room that it did not do in other houses; the root under their mats shifted its weight as if adjusting to a remembered tide, and someone’s cup trembled exactly once.

“They will make us do something like swimming even if there is no water,” Amihan said, pushing hair back and looping the pink and white laces into obedient bows. “They are fond of putting things where they don’t belong and then asking politely if we can convince them to act as if they do.”

“I can swim,” Ines said, then added in the careful flat tone of those who do not wish to be praised for the wrong skill, “in milk, certainly. In whey less so. In the sea I grow ears I do not know how to use.” She lifted the cloth and checked the wheels within, pressed a finger softly into a rind that pushed back with cheeky give, and nodded as if a schedule had been agreed.

By the time they gathered in the Commons, the hurricane-haired woman had coaxed the porridge into the world it deserved. Bowls steamed with the smell of malagkit and the green of pandan leaf, and because the morning had decided it wanted to be generous, there was latik scattered over the top in brown islands. “Eat,” she said to them all, not unkindly and not kindly but in the voice of someone who knew what the thinness of hunger did to the accuracy of choosing. “The day will ask things you cannot answer hungry.”

The old man stood again on the steps that liked to pretend they did not keep count and looked at them as if counting simply for the pleasure of finding out how many they were this time. He did not speak until the quiet grew friendly enough to be trusted. “Sorting is an ugly word for a beautiful thing,” he said, and the Institute made a sound like someone clearing their throat to disagree and then not. “We will not put hats on you. We will not read your thoughts. We will ask your hands and your eyes, and they will tell us who you have been lying to. The river will try your wrists. The sky will try your neck. You will carry water. You will spill it. You will be asked to try to hold wind. You will fail. That will be the success.”

A small boy with hair like a bird’s nest popping out of a book said, almost inaudible and with awe rather than fear, “He keeps saying failure as if it were a kind of sweetness,” and someone near him squeezed his shoulder, a punctuation that said the boy was not wrong.

They took them outside of inside to a courtyard the tree had made for days that required more horizon. The trunk opened into a space where the canopy cut the world into green coins and light slid between them like a thief with a sense of humor. Hanging from three low boughs were vessels: a clay pot blackened with the burn of previous lessons, a clear glass bowl that held nothing and pleaded to be filled, and a long teardrop of woven rattan that looked like a fish trap convinced to become a bottle. On the ground, in a square made of four branches laid down by someone who understood that squares do not occur in trees except when invited, there was a mosaic of pebbles the colors of stories overheard: browns and greys and a few whites, and one pink stone trying hard to be ordinary.

“The river first,” said the Registrar, who had appeared like a stilt-walker without the stilts and without the need to be watched to be seen. “Those who grew up speaking to water may go later. Those who think water will listen because the mouth says pretty words may go earlier.” Her necklace of buttons had acquired a new one: a shell button whose hole had been punched too near the edge so that thread would have to be careful with its affection. She pointed to the pot. “Carry this across the square and pour it into the glass without spilling. When you spill, tell the ground why. When you do not spill, tell the water why.”

“You say when,” murmured Ines, leaning toward Amihan without leaning. “As if spilling were not accidental but religious.”

“Spilling is always personal,” said the eel-boy dreamily. He had put his eel into the shallow bowl of an old leaf, and the creature lay there like a glossy bracelet that had been left behind by a wrist that went elsewhere. “It knows who you are.”

A girl whose jar had grandmother scratched on it went first. She bent to pick up the pot and was prevented by nothing but the polite weight of its request to be asked. “Please,” she said without shame, and the pot let itself be lifted, not becoming lighter but consenting to be exactly as heavy as it wished. She stepped into the square and began to cross. The pebbles shifted and the shape of the square did not, and for a moment it seemed like walking a polite disagreement. When a spoonful of water jumped the lip of the pot to kiss the stones, the girl looked down and said, “I am spilling because I have learned to notice other people’s breaths over my own, and it makes my hands generous when they should be selfish.” The stones drank. She reached the glass and poured and the pour made a sound that was not music and not speech but something neighboring both.

They sent them one by one and two by two, based on some calculus the Registrar kept in the way her eyelids shut only when she meant them to. When Ines was called, she stood with the unshowy poise of an object designed for a purpose that secular people might call art. She lifted the pot and winced because the heat had soaked into the clay with a loyalty that would have charmed a different sort of fool. She stepped onto the mosaic and the pink stone under her foot rolled exactly far enough to find her balance and then stopped. She did not look down. What Amazed and irritated—what courted her attention and met her refusal—was the smell that rose from the pot. It was just water. It was not just water. Ines’ face shifted to accommodate a thought and then disciplined itself back into neutrality. A small, precise amount slopped over the edge when a gust threaded through the roots and the air remembered it could be mischievous. “I am spilling because my country taught me that decay is a better teacher than perfection,” she said, the words not loud but precise enough to find their hearers. “Sometimes I respect that lesson too much and I do not try for clean lines because I assume the rind will forgive. The water is not rind. I am sorry to confuse my languages.” She reached the glass and poured without spilling another drop, and when the surface took on a faint bloom that was not quite milk and not quite dust, the Registrar’s eyes flickered in affection and trouble, and she made a mental note to put a particular teacher in a particular room at a particular hour.

When it was Amihan’s turn, the pot greeted her as if it had been waiting. “Magandang umaga po,” she murmured because there are only a handful of things more dangerous than a clay pot that thinks it has not been appropriately introduced. The square’s stones clicking underfoot sounded briefly like shells and then like bones. The pot was heavy but she had carried sandbags heavier, one wet night when a wall had gone weak with despair and the river had sent its impatience like soldiers. When water slapped against the inside as if it had seen visiting rights and intended to violate them, she tightened her arm with respect and not with fear. It still leaped once, a silver tongue, and kissed the ground. “I am spilling because I do not like to be watched,” she told the square and the water and the people who were not watching and were. “It makes me try to prove that I have hands and it is hard to prove what is true without bragging.” She reached the glass bowl and the pour went in a steady ribbon, and to her ear the sound it made as it arrived was very much like Dado calling her nest-hair in the mornings and being right.

“That will do,” said the Registrar to the air, and there was approval there and also a small shovel of warning, as if she had seen the way this child would want to pretend not to be listened to until the listening got its feelings hurt and made a mess of the table.

When the glass had been filled and emptied and filled again and had decided it would stop being transparent if they abused its generosity further, the Registrar led them to the woven teardrop. “The sky,” she said, and the sky, which had been pretending to be distant simply to maintain its reputation, leaned in as if it had heard its name and was not above eagerness. “You will be given a wind. Hold it. Carry it to the place where we have let the tree request you release it. Do not try to keep it beyond that place. Do not let it go early. The wind is not a pet. The wind is not a well-behaved child. The wind is a relative. The kind you thirst for and the kind you hide from at fiestas behind curtains, both.”

They stood in a line that pretended it was not a line, as lines do when embarrassed. The old man lifted the teardrop and pressed its mouth to the air near his lips and inhaled steadily, and the way the weave darkened and began to tremble made even those who had lived all their lives outdoors look up. He tied the mouth with a net of slips that would give if you asked them nicely at the wrong time. “There is your wind,” he said, not smiling because naming anything more than once is crossing a boundary and boundaries make him think of old men who do more harm than they know.

The eel-boy went first and the wind found him irresistible. It kissed his hair like foam and tried to writhe back to the world, and every time it wriggled he murmured as one murmurs to babies and sick dogs and gods, which is to say in the voice of someone who understands he is small and unafraid of it. He reached the circle chalked on the ground by a hand that liked circles to lean left, and he untied the knot and the wind spilled out with a sound like a joke three seconds before it is told. It coiled itself around his eel and then, remembering itself, unraveled upward to check if the branches were in the mood to be amused. The branches allowed themselves to be tickled and forgot to be offended.

Ines took the wind as one accepts expensive linen, carefully, aware of the damage oils can do and of the fact that the thing in your hand does not technically belong to you even as you must pretend it does for the duration of the task. She walked the chalk with economy. Twice the wind attempted to come cunningly out between the weaves and she pressed her palm there and gave it the sort of look one gives a toddler whose mud pie has ruined someone's shoes and who finds the entire affair admirable. “Later,” she told it, and the later attached itself to the weft. At the circle she unknotted the net with a speed that meant she had been taught useful knots in a place where they tied ropes around wheels of responsibility, and when the wind came out it did not rush. It unscrolled. It examined the ground and sniffed and then touched the hem of her dress like a relative who needs to measure how tall you have gotten without asking if you have eaten. It left with an audible hmm that made the Registrar glance at the old man, who nodded in a language of eyelids and ears that had been forged long ago when both of them had made a mistake at the same time and survived.

When Amihan took the wind, it recognized her mouth and pushed there, not to escape, but to set the word hello in the same direction as her breath. The teardrop cradled the tremble like a witness. She walked and for a bleak half-second thought of how the sky had felt on the roof of their house during the last typhoon, the way the whole world seemed to be a sheet someone bigger was attempting to shake the crumbs out of, and she wanted, fiercely and suddenly, to set the wind free simply because keeping it felt like an act that would be misread by the gods. She adjusted her grip and said, “Please,” her voice a thread, and the wind subsided enough to make her knees like her again. At the circle, instead of untie and lift, she crouched and put the teardrop down and loosened the knot while her cheek touched the weave and the conversation went out of words entirely. When it spilled, it did so without sound or show, as if the shape of her release were a secret it understood how to keep. It left a trace of its contour on her skin and dived upward to go tell the birds that someone had put manners on it without using shame.

By then they were sweating and stung and alive the way a river rat is alive when it decides to leave a safer bank for a rickety sweetness floating downstream. The Registrar marked rattan with chalk and clay and other things that accepted marks. The old man said less and his silence made a shape next to them that was comfortable to stand in. They sent them to another carpet of roots where the wood had been persuaded to be flat long enough to set out two long troughs: one empty, one full. “Carry this water,” said the hurricane-haired woman, who had decided to come outside and see who would need second breakfast later. “And spill that one.” She indicated the full trough for carrying and the empty one for spilling, and at least three students laughed from their throats out of sheer relief that someone would be rude to them in such an honest way.

“Which water is that one and this one?” asked a boy with the long neck of worry from the night before, genuinely puzzling because the troughs were identical babe-brothers and they sat with the same boredom and hope.

“What the trough makes of what you pour will inform you,” said the Registrar, and because she could sometimes be mean, she smiled and did not fix it.

They tried then, all of them, carrying and spilling and inventing reasons. Some spilled because their cup had a crack that had been hammered into it by a father two years ago and they were still learning who they were at the bottom where the water gathers. Some carried because their village had taught them that you do not greet the river by giving back what the mountain gave; you accept, you say thank you, you place it where the ranking system of your house decides to put things. Ines stood at the carrying trough and watched her hands move with the tidy memorized shapes of ritual. She had been taught to pour brine into the forms, to release whey, to save, to accept that the losses were the purity someone else would taste as luxury, and the movements made her elbows go easy. She carried until the trough rose to her attention in a way that translated to enough. Then at the spilling trough she stood and thought of loss that was not generosity. She thought of her aunt laughing that missing the sea only makes the cheese sulk. She poured water on the ground. It hesitated once and then disappeared into the root as if that had been the plan all along.

When it was Amihan's turn, she stood between the troughs and held one bowl in each hand, a balance that suited her politics. On the right was the water that needed to be carried; on the left the water that needed to be spilled, and in the space between them was the thin whip of old voices that insisted on saying, Who are you, child, that you get to decide what water wants? She set the left-hand bowl down and kneeled by it. “This is the day you do not have to be a flood,” she told that water, and there was no tremble in her voice. Then she took the bowl in both hands and spilled deliberately, spreading the pour along the length of the trough so it kissed each place equally because favoritism has always been the enemy of peace. At the right-hand trough she carried, not even glancing at her feet when a root decided it was tired of being stepped on and twitched, and when the bowl tipped she tightened everything and refused to allow even a cheek to know what fear is for. She tipped the water in and heard the faintest consent, the low murmur that comes from vessels when they are given exactly and not approximately what they had needed.

By the end of the morning the Institute knew more about them than did their parents and their cousins and the men who had looked at them in markets as if their bodies might be instructive. The Registrar's chalk had become a stub that bit her finger like a mouse and she tucked it away with absent tenderness into her hair. The old man looked at the sky until the sky rolled a cloud into shape simply to declare it was capable. They arranged the students not into camps but into matters. “Rivercraft,” the Registrar said, and her mouth smiled when her eyes did not, and those who had water under their tongues stepped forward and those who had feared water their whole lives until this hour and were surprised to find they had developed an affection for it in the time it takes to say a new name also stepped forward. “Sky,” said the old man, and those who tilted their faces as if listening for the angle of a gust or the shade of a cloud took their places. “Estuary,” said the hurricane-haired woman, in a voice that had paid attention to how much salt had been poured into a pot, and those who had been living in both since before their birth and those who had never known there were two things to stand in and were delighted to discover their legs preferred both answers came as if stepping into a story halfway and pleased not to have to endure exposition.

Amihan moved to Estuary with the certainty of someone who had been given a word that finally allowed the rest of the sentence to hold its own weight. Ines watched Sky as if it were a city with streets named after the polite adjectives, then glanced at River and wrinkled her nose almost invisibly at the thought of mud under fingernails that had always been clean because of work that looked like anything except labor. Then she stepped into Estuary as well, not because of Amihan but because the root under her foot made a particular argument and she had always been prone to respecting good logic even when it came from the ground.

They gave them teachers, which is to say they gave them people who could not help themselves. A woman with hair that had forgotten color and had remembered lightning would take them to the river's edge and show them how to measure depth with their breath. A young man who was a bird when he tired of being a man would teach them to read the language of gusts that came out of mouths a hundred kilometers away. A person old enough to be a rumor named Apo Sili would show them how to ask the salt to suspend its desire to own the soup long enough to let sweetness be heard. “We do not call this class cooking,” he said later when he had them around a rickety table with bowls that had been glued and glued again. “We call it treaty.”

At afternoon they let them rest long enough to think they understood what rest was for. The Estuary students were sent down to the river's nearest elbow where a small jetty had been convinced to exist by the promise that no heavy boats would ask it to carry their secrets. Palapaw was there in his boat shape and also walking alongside it, which was an inefficiency that he indulged in because he liked to show off to institutions that thought they could tell the difference. He nodded to them and then inconvenienced himself by bowing to Apo Sili because stubborn men like to be caught being tender. “We will not go far,” he told the students and the river, both of whom had been born hungry and had not changed. “We will not go deep. The Institute does not like to lose children early in the term. It causes paperwork.”

They leaned over the water until their noses were shown a portrait of themselves in ripples. Dado did not appear; perhaps he was sulking, perhaps there were matters to the north that needed his eye. Fish they did not know by name came and considering them decided they were none of them edible, which is either an insult or a reprieve, depending on where you stand in your life. Apo Sili handed around small packets wrapped in banana leaves. “Do not open,” he said, and of course three pairs of fingers tightened with the desire to defy. “The thing in there is a joke. When the river tells you one, you must have one to tell back or you will be the sort of person who laughs and cannot offer anything. Telling the river a joke is not required. It is, however, recommended.”

Ines held her packet without suspicion. Banana leaf did not obey her and this pleased her. She slipped the packet into her pocket with the cheeses and did not notice that the cloth in which she wrapped one of them had identified this leaf as kin and stroked it in sleep. When he distributed the last of the leaves and the last of the warnings, Apo Sili had them climb onto the jetty and lie down. “You will watch the sky’s underside through the water,” he instructed, inconvenient and sure. “You will say what you see. We will disagree and be happy with it. If you are the kind of person who requires that everyone see the same bird you see in the cloud, you will quit this school or this life, and we will not keep your seat.”

They lay there, elbows propped, shoulders wet where drops had flipped rebelliously, and looked down. The sky was a difficult thing to capture in words even when it was obedient. From below it was a bridegroom you did not trust, a roof that had decided to become a story, a sheet that had been washed and beaten and hung to dry and then blown from its line by a wind that had opinions about laundry. “I see a canoe going backwards,” said the boy with the long neck, and Apo Sili grunted as if he had been handed exactly the right tool for once. “I see a fish that is a question mark with impudence,” said the grandmother-jar girl, and her jar thumped in approval in her bag. “I see a wheel of cheese that has been asked to be moon and accepted,” said Ines, and for a second she let the accent bare itself, round and weighty, and then tucked it back into its case. “I see my mother’s hand in the air telling people to wait, which makes them more impatient,” said Amihan, her voice soft because the hand was soft even when it was commanding a wind.

They told the truth and they told what they needed to, and the river kept its own counsel. When Palapaw swung the boat around and let the prow bump the jetty precisely twice, they sat up, their backs lined with the imprint of the wood, and shook themselves like birds. The afternoon was turning the gold that spells both kindness and danger. The myna down near the southern fork chose that moment to land on the bole of a root and begin an anecdote about the time it had convinced a fisherman to name his seventh child after a fish and the fisherman had done it and the child had never forgiven any of the adults in her house. “He is a liar,” murmured Apo Sili with respect. “He will tell you a truth so you accept the lie that follows. Do not negotiate with him without peanuts. Do not give him peanuts.”

They made for the Commons before the Commons grew shy with twilight. The hurricane-haired woman had decided to cook something that had as many roots as the balete and fewer complications. There were gabi leaves chopped fine and sautéed long enough to shed their malice, there was coconut milk that had made peace with its own fat, there were chilies that grinned, and somewhere a fish had agreed to lend its bones for a while to the broth and be returned clean. “Eat with rice,” the woman announced, because rice keeps the ego humble and is the only reason islands are not galactic. They did. They ate with rice and the room made the satisfied noises of pots being washed in corners and someone retelling a joke badly and being forgiven because their mouth was too occupied with soup to contain timing.

Later, when the Institute had found the night and decided not to hoard it, a small crisis played itself out in the Estuary House that would have gone badly almost anywhere else. The grandmother-jar girl, whose name turned out to be Tiya in the way of people whose names are letters and honors, set her jar on her shelf and sat down on her mat and breathed in twice and then discovered that the jar was no longer where she had put it. The shelf held instead a neat ring of salt, fine as breath, and the word please scratched in a handwriting that had been disciplined by a ruler on knuckles. Salt is a letter to those who can read it; to those who cannot it is an inflamed thing, an accusation, a habit. Tiya made the sound a clay pot makes when you tap it and find it empty. She did not wail. She did not shout. She stood up and said, “Somebody has borrowed something that is not to be borrowed,” and the room felt the sentence as a change in humidity, a recalibration.

Ines flinched, sharp and immediate, because salt and borrowing were her native tongue and her bad habits both. She stood with the look of someone who is prepared to maintain innocence and accept blame, which is a skill that wins wars with aunties and loses friends. “It was not I,” she said before anyone asked, which made the walls narrow by a hair in the way that rooms do when a person makes more sound than required. Her bundle lay obedient on her mat, tied and not shedding. The cheese within behaved itself because it liked being watched.

“It was the myna,” said the eel-boy, half-joking because he had never had a grandmother in a jar and did not want to misunderstand grief with his cleverness.

“It was not the myna,” said the Registrar from the threshold, and no one turned all the way around because she had said it with the exasperation of a woman who had told a child not to jump from a branch again and found him on the ground with his arm at an angle. “He would have left a feather with a swear in it. It was a thing that can move without touching the ground. It was a House Wife with an agenda, or else the tree attempting to rearrange grief for you because it thought it was being helpful.” She bent, took one pinch of the salt circle between finger and thumb, and put it on her tongue. Her face made a shape that announced the salt had been taught to speak by someone the Registrar needed to respect later, possibly with a broom. “And it may have been aggravated by a language it thinks you brought in improperly. If you keep salt in this room, the room will be too thankful for the rest of your lives.”

“I will put my salt elsewhere,” Ines said, apologizing without apology. “I will keep it in the mouth of my friends and I will teach it to sit.”

“You will keep it in the Commons where the Institute can watch it teach you manners,” the Registrar corrected, and then softened as Tiya stood without rocking and the jar was still an absence that made a bigger sound than presence does. “Hold,” she told the room, and all breath suspended for a thin astonishing second. The roots listened. The boards remembered. The hinges stopped being doors and became ears. The flame that pretended to be a lamp cleared its throat. “Give back,” she told the room, not stern and not pleading but in the way you tell a child a story before bedtime, and the story has a monster that learns to be a shadow.

There was a rustle at the window, not like wind, which does not care how it sounds, but like a person owning up to something and hoping not to be asked to do it again immediately. The jar came forward on invisible feet of want. It did not scrape the sill. It did not apologize. It crossed the floor to Tiya and rested itself against her shin like a cat that knows it will not be punished and also knows the person it loves will watch it more attentively from now on. Tiya’s hands shook and then steadied without help. She lifted the jar. She put her ear to its lid and said, “Never again,” and then she added, because love is not a policeman, “unless you really needed to.” Then she put it back where it had been and drew a chalk line around it that meant, in the alphabet of chalk that people who put squares on floors have always known: Boundary. Welcome. Both.

The Registrar looked at Ines and then at Amihan and then at the notch where the hook and the seed were practicing coexistence. “You will learn to keep things,” she said, making it general so it wouldn’t have to be personal yet. “And to let things be kept by the right hands and not your hands. This place makes thieves of us, because everything is to be had like fruit. You must become the sort of thief who borrows properly and returns with interest.” She looked as if she had had to learn this the hard way, which made her more pleasant to hear.

The night laid itself down like a pillow that had previously been a rock. The myna outside tried to apologize in a voice that was not his and failed, and then attempted to cough up a feather with a swear and succeeded and swallowed it again quickly because a House Wife peered around a corner with a broom. The hurricane-haired woman sang as she scrubbed a pot, a love-song to a rice variety that hated everyone equally and thus was loved by all. Somewhere the old man stared at the moon until she became reasonable and he nodded as if he had taught her anything. In their beds the students sorted themselves without ceremony into those who snored and those who listened to others snore and those who would wake up in the dark with the kind of thought that changes a life and not know who to tell.

Amihan slept and had no dream she could nail to a board in the morning and show. She floated somewhere just under consciousness where the river goes when it wants the day to make its own mistakes. In the middle of that floating, someone knocked politely on the inside of her skull. She sat up without sitting. A smell reached her that was not the room and not the tree and not the river. It was cultured; it had been taught to behave and had learned to enjoy the discipline. It lifted a corner of itself like a skirt and revealed the muddy edge of a cave where brine had licked stones for centuries. It said nothing because smells often know more about manners than voices ever will. There was a shape near her mat, standing in the section of dark that had hired itself to be shade for the night. It had the outline of a girl and the self-possession of a gift. The figure did not move. The smell did. It shifted closer and then lay down like a rug. When she leaned forward, her hands met cloth. The bundle was heavy the way responsibility is heavy, precise and unaccidental. There was a note pinned to the cheesecloth with a thorn the size of a prayer. It said, in a hand that had learned too early to respect paper, For when your salt is wrong. It will try to teach you a lesson. Teach it back. The note did not say who had written it. The smell did, but Amihan chose not to praise herself for being able to read that. She tucked the bundle under her shelf, next to the chalk. The hook watched without jealousy. The seed slept.

In the morning, while the Institute stretched in that way old things do when they want to make the day think they are new, a news arrived without steps. The Registrar’s eyebrows rose for exactly one moment when she heard it, and she did not need to tell anyone because the tree told them all: the city had sent delegations. There were fisherfolk with hats that had made their shape by hard labor and good jokes. There were barangay captains who wore their shirts tucked in like loyalty. There was a city councilor with a smile polished to a publishable finish. There was a man whose hands were mechanics’ hands and who smelled like river pump oil and guava leaves. He brought his wife, who wore tin in the backs of her eyes. They did not come to demand a performance or to present a plaque. They came because their daughter had gone where the tree keeps a ledger. They came because a school that does not meet your eyes when it takes your child is a school you should burn.

They waited by the inward water where the boats learned to be quiet. The Registrar met them. She did not improve her hair. She did not make her necklace more impressive; it had already decided not to. “Regina Luningning,” she said, and the name moved through the roots the way a rumor moves through minds: quickly and then, upon encountering respect, slowly. “Mateo,” she said to the mechanic, a mild greeting that would have been an embrace if she had been someone else. “You came to see whether our roof leaks. That is sensible.” The queen laughed because laughter can be used to make queens less queenly and more human, and she employed it in the way nurses use pins: deftly, quickly, to secure where a thing tends to slip.

“Can we see her?” asked Mateo in the voice of fathers who try not to ask, because if someone says no they will have to make a deity out of their mornings and an enemy out of their afternoons. “We will not interrupt work. We will only look and be looked at and then make a pretense of tidiness as we leave.” The Registrar imparted a look to the old man, who had arrived without announcement, and he nodded in the manner of ponds: an acceptance that will later look like decision if you insist on assigning credit.

They walked the path the Estuary students were walking that morning, where they were set to learn how to bridge a gap with things that do not like to be bridged. They arrived just as Apo Sili was instructing them to lash together, not planks, but disagreements. “A bundle of arguments makes a better raft than one long plank of certainty,” he told them, rubbing his chin with a knuckle scarred by the affinity of a knife he kept on bad terms. “Say so to yourselves. It will help when someone asks your river to be a line.”

Amihan stood on a root with a length of vine in her hands. Ines stood opposite, the two of them set to build a bridge with one rope and two tempers. They glanced at each other and then away, as if testing whether this was a day for cooperative verbs. “Left over right,” Amihan suggested, and Ines replied, “Right over left,” without heat, and then they looked down and saw that the vine had tied itself into a knot that was both and neither, because plants have always been cruelly good at grammar. “Middle over both,” Ines amended, and that made them both laugh, which is a bridge.

“Hoy,” said Mateo under his breath, too loud for the tree and not loud enough for the river, which ignores fathers when they try to be polite with their joy. Amihan’s head lifted. She did not look at the threshold where the world had walked into her lesson. She kept her eyes on the knot and on Ines’ fingers because if she looked she would forget that being a princess in the Institute is a reminder and not a request. Apo Sili watched her not look and approved without moving a hair. The queen took in the way her daughter said please to a vine by making its life easier, and her mouth shortened with pride in the way people we hesitate to admire use their mouths to hide that they are saturated with admiration.

The knot held. The bridge held as long as it was needed to, and when it decided it had completed its contract it relaxed into respect and did not throw anyone off. The class crossed one by one with the self-consciousness of people who do not trust structures made of apologies and arrangements. The eel-boy leaped and his eel leaped with him because imitation is the sincerest form of survival. Tiya stepped and the jar thumped against her hip to remind her of old ladies who do not forgive bridges unless the bridges ask for forgiveness. Ines crossed and did not sway; she did not believe in sway. Amihan crossed last, as if she had been appointed to watch and then to be watched, which was not untrue.

When she reached the far side, she allowed herself to look. Her mother’s shoulders were a cliff she had grown up on without falling. Her father stood in a way that meant he was counting bolts on an invisible machine and adding spares to his pocket. The Registrar had bowed her head and lifted it again without anyone noticing a bow had occurred. The old man had leaned against a root and convinced the root that this was simply what weight does to wood. Amihan did not wave. She did usisa with her eyes the way a market vendor does when her favorite customer arrives with a new bruise. Then she smiled without showing teeth and let the smile run down her bones to where the river could find it and carry it back to everything that had raised her.

Ines watched all this with interest like a finger. Not envy, which is a smell and was absent. Not pity, which is a taste and had no place here. Interest, the pure and meddlesome kind that cheeses require when you watch them and try to decide whether they will go noble or impertinent. She tucked a new string of thought under her existing braids and tightened the ribbon at the end. Later she would move the bundle of cheeses to the Commons because the Registrar had a hand that made obedience feel like a habit your grandmother taught you. Later she would give to the kitchen a sliver of something that had led a difficult life in a salt cave, and the hurricane-haired woman would sniff it, kiss her teeth twice, and set it aside for a day she needed to fix a soup that had started to lie to the tongue. For now, she considered the way a girl had not waved at her parents because she believed all waving should be done with more subtle parts of the body, like the heart, and she filed it next to the fact that when asked to spill, the same girl had made a speech to the ground first.

The rest of the day unrolled, refusing spectacle but giving small entertainments like a careful host. They were taught to listen for a flood’s ankles before they saw its thighs. They were asked to write letters to the wind and then to burn those letters unread, because the Institute believed in satisfying the sky’s prurience without surrender. They were supplied with string and asked to tie themselves to one another and then to say which knot had felt safest when they were pushed, because words come easier to those who have been tied in agreeable ways. They were instructed by a stone to stand on it and argue with their weight about where it should go, and when the argument grew boring to the stone, it sent them away and asked for someone with new stories to step on it.

At dusk, Palapaw returned, not with a boat, but with a grin that had collected a rumor. “Something is tired of being a shadow,” he told the Registrar, who sighed in a way that meant she had been expecting a thing to reach this point in its life and had hoped it would have the manners to postpone. “It will show itself during the next rain. It has teeth in the wrong place. It has eyes that belong to someone else. The city will call it a monster. The Institute will call it a student who has decided to be difficult.”

“The seventh rain will have cousins,” said the old man, leaning out of his jacket to scratch his ribs with a grace that would have made lesser beings cry. “We will tell the city the truth and be ignored in professional fashion. We will ask our students to choose which of their bargains to keep.”

In her bed, with the seed now warmed by the residue of her hands and the hook convinced that being on a shelf was work, not retirement, Amihan wrote her letter with her mind into the handkerchief her mother had given her. Nanay, you came and you were taller than I remembered, though you did not grow. I did not wave because I am learning new waves. We tied a bridge with the idea that we might fail, and it held, which made the failure elegant. I have a bundle that is a confession and a gift. It smells like a promise that I will not break if I can help it. Tell Tatay that the pumps thump slower here; it is a new language. Tell Lola that the banana leaf was used to tell a joke and none of the adults laughed but the river did. I am well. I am more. She folded the handkerchief in her head and placed it somewhere the tree would find it and carry it to the envelopes that roots keep for such purposes.

Ines lay with her eyes open because some nights are not for sleeping. She thought of salt and mouths and the way the Registrar had put a pinch on her tongue and read the sorry it had been taught to spell. She thought of the bridge they had made, which had been lovely and transitory, the way cheese is at some ages, and she wondered in the non-jealousy way what would happen the day a bridge was asked to carry a heavier thing than itself. She reached for one of the cheeses and did not unwrap it, the way one reaches for a bruise one does not intend to touch. “What will you teach me?” she asked it, and in the place under speech where answers begin, it told her: patience, if you can call it that; decay as a hope rather than an insult; the art of being forgotten and remembering to reveal yourself at the right mouth. She smiled in the dark. The room hummed with the small electric sound of learning. Outside, the myna dreamed of peanuts and respect and knew it would be denied both tomorrow, and the moon contemplated dropping another earring simply to see the river scold her with a kind of love that refuses to be anglified.

In the hour before dawn, when egrets change their beds and the balete turns its thoughts from its roots to its leaves, there came a patter that was not yet rain and might have chosen to be. The wind woke briefly and checked on its knots. Somewhere under the city an old drain remembered a story it had told children who had played near it and grew lonely. Dado swam up to the place where the Institute touched the river and knocked his head twice against a root. “Hoy,” he whispered, and the root listened with the entire coil of the tree. “Tell your princess to keep her hook clean. There will be things in the water that want to be caught and should not be. There will be things that do not want to be and should.” The root passed the message along with the patience of things that have always been involved in gossip against their will. The Institute filed it in a ledger next to a note about a girl who brought cheeses like polite stones. The ledger was made of wood and salt and a little grease, because all school records are.

When the real rain started, it did not announce itself. It simply took the stage and let the air become applause. The tree did not mind; it had been waiting to be washed. The students rolled to their feet and grinned the way anyone grins when the world finally does what you have been wanting it to all day. The Registrar lifted her face and let the water draw lines on it that the Institute recognized as marks of attendance. The hurricane-haired woman stepped outside with a bowl to collect the beginning of a storm because beginnings are the sweetest for soups. Ines opened her window a measured inch and put a slice of something pale on the sill because rain tastes better when taught to hold its salt. Amihan pressed her palms together and said, “Magandang umaga,” to the God of Wet, and the God of Wet, who is not a god as much as a set of behaviors, nodded and gave her a small bow in return, the way you do to someone you will be arguing with all your life and can’t help but love for it.The rain settled into its full intention and the Institute adjusted everything that could be adjusted. Roots let go slightly so water could find its routes without having to apologize. Ladders were pulled up so slippery wasn’t required to pretend to be fun. The House Wives stitched rags around broom handles so they would not leave splinters in storms. The Registrar walked through the Commons, hair pinned with keys that had rusted and been loved back, and said to no one and everyone, “It is the hour when we borrow the city,” and the tree made a noise like consent translated from another language. Students learned quickly that this meant fetch your shoes, your breath, your decision not to die, and meet at the inward water where the boats can hear the rain.

Amihan’s hands found the hook and the seed without looking. The seed clung with a capital secret; it had decided she was soil for now and that would have to do. She wrapped the handkerchief around her wrist under her sleeve because a message has weight even if it hasn’t been written on paper. Ines tied her bundle tight and then loosed it again and retied it not so much to be certain as to make the bundle understand that certainty was being rehearsed. She slipped out the sliver she had pinned with the thorn and tucked it into a smaller leaf with a deliberate grace that made the cheese behave. On their way toward the water they passed Tiya tap-tapping her jar with a fingernail as if waking an elder kindly and waking herself more sternly, and the eel-boy coaxed his eel into an old soup tin that had decided to be honor rather than trash, murmuring promises that had to do with puddles and patience.

Palapaw waited without drama, boat and man in the sort of agreement that marriages pretend to aspire to and seldom reach. He looked at the students as if counting cousins and debts and arrived at a number that satisfied him. “The city up there is wearing shoes too smooth for this day,” he told them, giving the prow a pat that made it thrum like a throat. “One of its drains has remembered a name it hates. It is making a nuisance of that memory. If we are polite with it, we will only get wet. If we are rude, we will get famous. Let us try for polite and obscurity.”

They slid into the channel below the Institute and the world changed temperature. The water was warmer than the air which did not make sense to anything but the river and the bodies that had lived next to it long enough to let sense be optional. The banks were hung with vines that had dressed themselves in rain and pulled it off. The sky leaned and watched through a curtain. Pala’s singing was a thread under the rain, a low coil of syllables whose only job was to keep the planks remembering how to stay together from one end of his song to the other. They came to a place where the roots lifted their hems and a gap presented itself as if someone had rolled up a carpet in a hurry. The boat went through and the city met them the way a relative does whose house has been flooded twice already this year and is still making coffee.

Beyond the last courteous bend of the Institute’s underways, the Pasig had put on its mood for work. The rain made blurs out of lights and then gave them back edges in the next breath. On one bank, a man in a sleeveless shirt shouted to a woman with a bucket with the ease of those who do not believe in telephones when the water is speaking. The market was a tight-lipped animal tucked into itself, tarps sagging like tired cheeks, ropes tightened until they sang. Under a bridge, a boy who had been a boy last week and a man today pulled a drowned slipper out of a mess of weed and packaging and looked briefly at who it had belonged to and then set it gently among other things that would never find their owners. Above them the monsoon unspooled a thick line and reeled it in, teasing.

“Hoy, Palapaw,” Dado called up from a wave, popping his coin eyes through the surface with the insolence of family. “Don’t go past the old oil shop. There’s a critter there with a favorite rock and a hatred of oars. Also, tell your children to tuck their nails in. There’s glass in the temper of the water.”

“We have ears typed to your voice by an unwise fate,” Pala replied without slowing, and Dado gave him a fin that might have been a salute and might have been a swear and sank without remembering to be dramatic. Apo Sili sat like a sack of something that would be delicious later and watched the edges of things. The Registrar kept her balance without needing her feet for it and looked at the sky as if writing a letter to be sent later and burned immediately after.

They smelled the thing before they saw it. It was not rot, which is an honest smell and lends itself to soup. It was not sewage, which is the scent of a city’s belly and contains all our unpoetic acts. It was a clean wrongness, a breath of plastic in a world of wood, a sterile and fragrant affront. The eel flattened itself without agreement from nerves; Tiya’s jar fogged, then cleared, then fogged as if an old woman has chosen to stir the breath inside with a spoon. “Eyes,” Ines said, not because she saw them yet but because the law of such matters is that where there is an improper cleaning, there are borrowed glances.

They rounded the oil shop that had not been an oil shop for years but could not be convinced to call itself anything else, and there it was, lamplight and lightning making deals about how to show it. It was the size of a jeepney and folded in ways that bodies do not choose unless they are being punished or made by someone who loves them without understanding how. Teeth studded its spine, not in a line but in a long zipper of metal things, bottle caps and the punched-out centers of electrical boxes, the jagged breaths of tin. Where a mouth should have been were lips sealed with a seam of tar, and where the eyes should have looked were smooth plates. Its eyes were in its hands—two bread-loaves of a thing at the ends of arms that were lengths of culvert. Palms looked and knuckles forgot. It had knees where elbows might want to be and elbows where knees were homesick for bending. It scraped itself along the side of the old seawall and the sound went up the city like chalk shrieking on a board. It dragged in its train the frames of umbrellas with their skin torn, and a scarf of streaming, tangled tape that had once held cartons together and had since decided to invent a kind of medusa for Manila in the rain.

“The alulod took a shadow and gave it bones,” the Registrar said, voice low to keep panic from applying for a position. “Storm-drain child. It has been fed on refusals. It has remembered that everything comes to it without being asked. It is tired of being a hole. It wishes to be an answer.”

“If it blocks the sluice, Kapitolyo floods and the mall blames the city and the city blames the rain and the rain sulks and drowns somebody to prove its point,” Palapaw observed in the tone of a man discussing biscuits. “We are here to interrupt.”

“Not kill,” Amihan said because the Mara in her grandmother’s stories would have hacked such a thing to parts and distributed them to boys who had behaved. “We are not here to kill.”

“Not kill,” Apo Sili agreed, and patted the pocket where his knife hid as if to console it that stabbing was not a profession today. “We never aim for paper pushing. We aim for a treaty with rotten edges. Rotten edges are edible.”

They kept their voices in their throats and their eyes on the thin things—currents, weak joints, habits. The rain gave them privacy by being loud. The monster was not a monster; it was a sentence written by a city whose handwriting had been rushed by poverty and ego. It had taken into itself what didn’t belong anywhere else and now asked to belong as a single self. Its hands-eyes swivelled in that eerie childish way, looking desperately for a face to trust and failing because every face looked like water to a thing that had only ever known halves.

The plan unrolled itself quietly in the air between the Estuary students the way rope learns to be used after months of lying around becoming arrogant. Tiya lifted her jar halfway and closed her eyes and opened her mouth and let out a humming not unlike the one the river uses to keep itself together when barges are rude. The sound wove and spread, not a song, precisely, because there were no words, but a path for words to arrive on without collisions. The eel-boy tipped his tin and let a spoon of river back into the river, which is the river’s favorite thing; his eel snapped at a drop and got its mouth full of sky and looked offended and then decided that was symbolism and forgave everyone. Ines took out her leaf-wrapped sliver and unrolled the banana leaf with reverence the way a priest unwraps an old cloth and recognizes a stain and a story. The cheese was pale as promise, its rind florid and wrinkled in a way that might have seemed obscene if you didn’t keep salt in your pocket. It smelled like a cave that had been told a joke and was pretending it hadn’t understood. She pinched a thumb-sized piece between two fingers and held it a breath above the water, letting the rain wet its skin without soaking it senseless.

“My teacher at home used to say that when people have salted themselves wrong, you can correct them with patience and mold,” she murmured, the island in her voice standing up from its sea. “But not too much. You poison if you treat their hunger as a sin. You feed if you treat their mistakes as a language you are willing to learn first.” She dipped the cheese into the water like a christening with pagan rules and let the rind share its citizens with the river. Invisible work started instantly; bacteria, which never asked permission and yet were scrupulous, went to their instruments. The clean wrongness that had made their noses itch met an older wrongness with manners and was briefly confused. The smell shifted upward into something like family. Palapaw made an approving noise that could have been a cough borrowing wisdom.

Amihan knelt in the bottom of the boat and drew quickly with the chalk on the inside rim, lines that meant boundary and welcome, come and go, yes and later. She spoke under her breath not to the storm child because it did not hold words well—it was palms and elbows and pipes and school complaint—but to the water in and through it. “Magandang umaga po,” she said, making the morning exist for the duration of the greeting even though it was four in the afternoon. “I know you are tired of never being the subject of a sentence. I know you want to stand up and ask why garbage goes where you are and not to the doorsteps of those who make it. I cannot fix their doorsteps. I can escort you to a place where the unfinished lives of things sit and remember how to be parts again. If you come, I will let you hold something important for me until my hand is ready.”

“What thing?” Palapaw asked without moving his mouth, which is a trick of boatmen and liars. She knew it without checking her pocket. She looked at her shoe. The laces were a promise she had made to her childhood; pink and white, thready and stubborn, they had seen bakwit lines and water lines and the mark her Lola’s cane made when tapping a floor that wouldn’t tell truths. The river knew them. The storm child gathered eyes into its hands and looked at her laces and saw that story and leaned.

She unthreaded the pink lace, the one that had always been too bright in pictures and just bright enough in floods. The lace came away with the melancholy of a pet who knows the suitcase is out. She looped it once around the bronze hook to teach it a lesson about being seen and then once around the notch where the seed sat warming like a concealed sentence. She tied it between, a bridge without hubris. “I will leave it on the rock by the old ferry dock,” she told the water. “If you come, it will belong to you until I am done with what they are going to ask me to do here, and then you can decide whether to come back for rice and jokes or not.”

The storm child moved. Not a lunge, which would have brought the city roaring, but a careful half-roll of its spine so that the teeth along it clattered like coins in a charity box. The hands-eyes fixed on the pink and made a decision without words. It scraped itself along the wall toward the old ferry dock where a rock had always held the city’s weight more faithfully than budgets do. As it moved, the wrong-clean smell broke into pieces and the bacteria from Ines’ sliver began to conduct. The rain gave them a screen and in that moment Amihan understood why the sky and Institute had to be friends: privacy that was not secrecy is a gift governments cannot give.

“Do not let it be seen too cleverly,” the Registrar said, which is the sort of instruction that infuriates justice and saves afternoons. Apo Sili stood and took from his pocket the packet of banana leaf the Institute had placed there and flicked it open with an old man’s right to frivolity. He lifted the joke inside, which was the smallest of lizards carved from coconut shell with a tongue bright red on one side and white on the other. He set it on the gunnel of the boat and it stayed because magic is not a runaway, and he told the river the sort of joke that older men get away with telling even though they shouldn’t. It wasn’t funny. The river laughed anyway, because jokes are bridges, not mirrors, and you cross a bridge for reasons that do not include admiration. In the laugh, the storm child relaxed the set of its elbows and the ribbon of tape around its waist let go of a door handle it had decided was a sword and slipped backward with dignity.

At the dock, a small cohort of people had gathered—always this city has an audience. A boy with a sago cup in one hand and his little sister’s wrist in the other stared the way children stare at church interiors and ants and rockets. An old man under an umbrella printed with cartoon dogs had put his thumb solemnly on the edge of the storm and kept it there, which does nothing and everything. The pink lace showed itself on the wet shoulder of the rock like tongue at a wedding. The storm child hand-gazed, stuttering, then reached and took it with a delicacy that made Ines briefly ashamed of every impatient act she had called efficiency.

“Hoy,” said a woman in a cheap raincoat at the far end of the dock, squinting. “That’s the mayor’s niece’s lace.”

“Everything in this city is the mayor’s niece’s something,” replied the man with the cartoon dog umbrella, and the woman snorted, a sound the rain carried away with respect.

“Now,” said Palapaw, and the now involved eight bodies and three breath-habits and a boat and at least one jar. The Estuary students put their hands in the water together and did not do the same thing; they did related things properly. Ines turned her wrist with the knowledge of brines that had to be kept just shy of tyranny. Tiya let her jar collect two breaths and release one so the balance felt like help. The eel-boy let his eel point at a current and followed as if it were a teacher. Apo Sili told the storm child in Ilocano to behave, in Tagalog to be kind, in a language older than both to remember it came from mouths that had laughed while washing clothes in esteros that had not yet learned to hiss. The Registrar listened for permission and found it in the way the rain hit a piece of corrugated tin and changed tempo.

The storm child edged into the mouth of a side canal that had been blocked with furniture by a rich man’s habit of moving and leaving his past in the street. It lifted an armoire with its knee-elbow and apologized to it with its hand-eyes and slid it aside with an efficiency that made our species look like we had not been paying attention to furniture as long as we had. It folded itself into the darkness like a long argument deciding to become a story. The wrong-clean smell slackened and then did not so much vanish as make room for other smells to be remembered. The rain sang on, a little bored now that it had been useful. A jeepney plowed through a puddle and baptized a dog that forgave instantly. The boy with the sago cup punched the air once in approval because nothing had exploded and this was the kind of victory his body had been taught to celebrate.

The river leaned toward the Institute for an instant the way a mother leans toward a balcony when she sees her child below and remembers the body is still her business. “Tantiyado,” it said, satisfied with the carefulness of the job, and the balete replied by shaking rain off a few leaves as if embarrassed to be thanked where it could be seen.

Back in the boat, everyone’s shoulders dropped an inch and a half. Ines retied her bundle and tucked the damp, half-bitten sliver into the fold with the care of someone who recognizes that even if a thing has given something up it would like to be treated as if it still has pride. She did not put the sliver near her softest cheese; she tucked it beside the wheel that had always looked older than its age because some affinities are dangerous and some are instructive. The pink lace glowed faintly under the water as the storm child pulled it to a place where not even light insists on being kept informed. Amihan felt the absence on her shoe as if it were the absence of a tooth and then as if it were the presence of decision, and both were correct.

They let the boat drift to where it was safe to make the lips on their faces do ordinary things. Apo Sili took the coconut lizard and pressed its red tongue to the edge of the boat, leaving a color like gossip. “Joke returned,” he told the river, because debts must not be treated as slow-interest just because you enjoy them. The Registrar reached without looking and tapped each student lightly on the forehead as if counting waves in a storm and finding them, for the moment, small. Palapaw turned the prow toward home, which is a word with too much work to do in a city like this, and began the kind of song that reminds planets who forget their orbits.

The Institute received them with dry hands. By which is not meant that their hands were dry—how could they be—but that the tree let their drips be someone else’s problem and made steps appear that preferred wet feet. The hurricane-haired woman stood in the Commons with a pot that had decided the rain would be its religion. She ladled out bowls and none of the bowls were exactly the same broth as any other, which taught a lesson without requiring a chalkboard. For Ines there was a soup that took cheese’s heart and melted it into coconut with the audacity of a marriage no priest had blessed. For Amihan there was a soup that tasted like riverbanks after scolding and before forgiveness. For Tiya there was a soup that smelled like laundry and old women’s wrists. For the eel-boy there was a soup that might have been plain water and was not, which satisfied an eel in a way nothing else can.

They sat in eddies around the long table and let their breathing learn the lesson of bowls. The myna dropped from some higher branch and stood on the back of a chair like a person who works for a newspaper and announced, for the whole room to hear, that he had single-handedly convinced the storm child to stop being dramatic by offering it peanuts, then remembered the warning about peanuts and took a sharp detour into claiming credit for the rain’s tempo. Apo Sili flicked him a look that would have knocked a lesser bird right out of his own vanity and the myna coughed into his wing and changed the subject to the moon’s jewelry.

When the bowls sat empty, the old man stood and took off his jacket and folded it over his arm and leaned against the idea of a pillar in the way that made pillars agree. He studied them as if counting letters in a word he knew too well. “The city misplaces parts of itself,” he said conversationally, as if discussing recipes, because terror is a spice and you cannot use it every day without losing your reading of subtlety. “This is the work. Not making things disappear because they are ugly. Not forcing things to be beautiful because we will be paid for the picture. Escorting. You escorted. You taught something back. That phrase pleases me.”

The Registrar spoke then without standing, because she did not need the height. “The next time a thing tired of being a shadow shows its teeth where its spine should be, we will ask you to decide faster. It will be inconvenient. The river is learning you. It will expect more. You cannot expect yourself to be gods but you can expect yourselves to be proper witnesses. Witnesses do not avert their eyes and then claim confusion. Witnesses do not call the police when what is needed is a broom and a joke and a lace.”

After the meal the Estuary House smelled like a mixing bowl: rice, wool, the faint and persistent cave of cheese. In the corner by the window where the fireflies had agreed to become parentheses again, the House Wife assigned to the room—she who preferred to be known by her broom and not her name—stood with hands on hips and looked at each bed as if reminding them they had better hold their students up and not invite the floor to collect scraps of dreams. She swept in long strokes that made a sound like the sea when it is deciding not to swallow a boat. She paused by Amihan’s mat and glanced down at the empty eyelet where the pink lace had once lived. “Maganda,” she observed, not about the shoe but about the absence, and then she went on with her work as if she had always approved of choices that left you balanced on one foot and then taught you to use the other.

The ears in the night were busy again. Somewhere in the crown of the Institute a child argued with a gust and, being polite, lost. Down near the roots a rat proposed marriage to a piece of sugar and was rejected and told to improve himself. Ines took out a sliver no bigger than a thumbnail and placed it delicately on the bowl the House Wife had left full of new rain and watched the ring that spread in the water’s face, a bloom at the skin like a memory deciding to be generous. She thought of the layouts of caves, the careful rackings and rubbings, the bacteria that were not enemies but choirs. She thought of Manila as a place growing a rind around itself not to shut out but to teach inside how to be delicious. She felt homesick for a place where people congratulated you for understanding mold, and then the thought twisted and she realized she could be congratulated here too, if she used her insistences to make treaties instead of thrones.

Amihan wrote with her mouth closed and her mind open, a habit she would never use on a person because it feels like theft unless the person is your mother and asked for it before you left the house. Nanay, we borrowed the city and returned it without stain though we added stitches. There was a child made by drains and wrong salt and we did not make it go away; we showed it a room. I paid with a lace you bought me when you had three coins and a sigh. It is with the river now. I put a sliver of someone else’s patience in the water and the water did not spit it out. Tell Tatay that the alulod is sulking less, and tell him I did not put my fingers in any motors. Tell Lola I used her joke at the exact moment it could be forgiven and it worked badly and then well, which is how jokes should. I miss your breath but I am borrowing the Institute’s and it is steady.

Before sleep caught the house by the ears, there was a knock on the doorframe that made the wood pretend it was not excited. The Registrar stood there with her necklace of buttons turned the wrong way for once, perhaps to remind herself she had a throat and not just policies. She held a little box made from a cigar tin with a label worn white by long pockets. “A ledger-entry in the form of a gift,” she said without fanfare, and when nobody leaped up to bow she relaxed infinitesimally, pleased they were learning that love doesn’t want its knees cracked. She opened the tin and inside lay three small objects: a knot of vine hardened into permanence, a bead carved from river-polished glass, and a nail whose point had been blunted and then blunted again. “For the bridge you made that held and then didn’t lean on its luck; for the seeing you did through other people’s eyes; for not letting the city puncture you with its urgency. This is not ceremony. It is inventory. You will need these later.”

She placed the vine knot in Ines’ palm, where it warmed instantly, remembering the shape of things that had been asked to hold and had held and had not resented. She put the glass bead into Tiya’s hand, and the grandmother in her jar thumped approval as if applied glass were a religion. She handed the nail to Amihan, and the metal sat cool and unshowy on her skin, a reminder that blunting is not the opposite of sharpness so much as its alternate career. “Do not give them names,” the Registrar advised, because names make things visible to thieves. “Do not show them to anyone who talks in rushes. Use them without preparing speeches about why.”

The next week braided itself around rain and assignment and the sudden, sharp households of strangers becoming not strangers. They learned how to listen for eddies under the tongue, and Ines admitted she could taste the difference between the descriptors of Sky and River when both were brought in through rain. They were told by Apo Sili to bring two things they loved to class and to break one and to repair the other and to write down which act felt like an apology and which felt like a promise. The eel-boy beamed because his eel refused to be used metaphorically and wriggled off, uncooperative. Tiya brought a piece of her own hair and tied it to a root and cut it and did not cry. Amihan took the chalk square she had drawn on the floor near her mat and rubbed out one corner and left the other intact and learned that leaving is not always the opposite of staying.

The word from the city arrived in dribs and rumor: a video of a thing in the rain that was either a transformer exploding or a miracle; comments underneath that revealed more about the loneliness of the commenters than about plastic; a council meeting where someone used the word monstrous twice in a row and then someone else said “allergy” to pollution and thought they were being poetic. Regina Luningning sent, via a fisherman with eyebrows like roof gutters, a string of dried fish and a folded letter that had only five lines and each line was a question that let her daughter answer without putting a verb into a drowning. Mateo sent a bolt head with a hole worn fine from a hundred miles and a note written on its weight that said, You will need this to worry with. Lola sent silence that smelled like burned sugar and a hymn misremembered.

Ines sat on the veranda they called a veranda because no one had found a better word and peeled thin slivers of cheese from a wheel with reverence and placed them on a leaf and watched rain drip from a root and land exactly between the two slivers and realized she was making a conversation she could not render into sentences yet. “I will need to ask you not to be yourself sometimes,” she told her cheeses as if they were godchildren. “If you misbehave, misbehave toward treaty.” She looked down into the layers of the tree and saw Amihan below talking with the eel-boy about why some knots have to be ugly to be safe. She did not sigh. She tightened the ribbon on her braid and chose a sliver that was more rind than flesh and set it away to ripen further, even though all her instincts said feed it to someone who thinks mold should live in the dark.

On the third morning after the storm child had been coaxed into its new subject, the myna found Ines on the veranda and said in a very fair imitation of Apo Sili, “Do not feed the bird,” and then added in his own voice, “You, Cheese Princess, you have a face for weather. When you are angry the humidity rises by a small percent,” and then he hopped twice so as not to seem earnest and flew off to tell the hurricane-haired woman a story about love and salt that had not happened to him but to someone whose hair he had stolen.

The next rain arrived like a visitor returned too soon. It had less patience and more teeth. It threaded between the Institute’s ribs and plucked. The tree smiled with all its cells and declined to be put out. The Registrar put away her tin and took out a ledger made of bark and breath and looked at a page that had been written on the day before anyone who lived now had been born. “A cousin,” she said to the old man, and he nodded as if he had been expecting visitors and had already warmed the politeness.

This time what needed escorting was not in the river but above it, a gust that had been taught by buildings to fling itself at corners and bruise itself against glass. It had collected voices and whipped its tail with their anger. It had business in the high walks, the empty ones, not yet built but already argumentative. It wanted to be a whistle but had been used as a sigh too often. “Sky work,” said the old man, and the Sky students made themselves thin for once so the Estuary ones could regard them without suspecting they were being shown off. But the gust hungered for water even as it hated it, and so both stories had a part to play. The sorting they had done days ago turned out to be less about rooms and more about wrists.

They climbed to the crown, led by a ladder that grew in front of them when flattered and retired behind them when not needed, and for a moment the world was leaf and mist and the kind of height that makes a heart tidy. Manila spread once again, promiscuous with rooftops and noise and effort, and the river was a long thought threading through a paragraph that had gone on too long. The gust hit them with the hand of a person who does not intend hurt and achieves it anyway. The Registrar steadied the person behind her without turning. Apo Sili sat down on a limb that had preferred birds for a hundred years and made it change its mind by being heavier.

“Hold this,” said the Sky teacher, the bird-man, and his hair stood up like feathers committing to a shape. They held it, and it was nothing they could hold, and that was the point. “Now let it go where it allows you to,” he added, and that was all the instruction anyone in a serious life ever gets. Ines lifted her chin slightly and felt the wet on her throat and understood that here salt was not brine but skin, and she adjusted by forgetting that she was marvelous and becoming generous. Amihan took the edges of a current and found the way it wanted to parse a corner and she spoke a yes to that grammar and the gust calmed into a comma instead of continuing its long exclamation. The eel-boy laughed because he had no business up a tree and the tree made room for his inappropriate body; his eel wrapped itself in his hair like an accent and refused to say sorry.

When the wind had learned enough manners to go be helpful elsewhere, they descended and counted themselves with fingers and relief and mild disappointment because triumph is always too small when you are young. In their room, by some quiet pact, Ines took out a slice from the bundle she had left under Amihan’s shelf and set it between them on a banana leaf and then, in a gesture that turned her islands toward Manila without asking anyone’s permission, she took a small jar from her bag and unscrewed its lid and let out into the room a smell that was not perfume but lesson. It was a smear of history, barn and cave and sea and the way milk resists becoming anything but itself. “When your salt is wrong,” she said, touching her fingertip to the paste and then to her tongue, not dramatic, not hiding, “you fix it by introducing a civilization that will not back down but will not conquer either. You do it slowly. You do it in weather like this. If I give you this, I will ask you one day to make it again for me, without me. Do you take that debt?”

Amihan’s eyes widened because debt is not a small word in her house. Then she remembered how the river always looks like it is about to leave and stays, how her mother’s crown is inside her head and not on it, how the hook and the seed had been arguing in their notch until she tied them into a bridge and they quieted. “I will take it,” she said. “I will give back with interest if the world allows me. If it does not, I will give back by refusing to drown.” She put her fingertip into the paste and tasted and almost laughed because it was wrong and right and would teach her a thousand tiny hates that would become loves. They ate the sliver together without bread, without apology, and the room filled with a smell that argued politely with the damp and the bananas and the wood until the wood conceded and took notes.

Outside, the rain pushed conversationally at the balete and the balete pushed calmly back. The city rehearsed its grievances and its miracles. The storm child wore a pink ribbon somewhere in a dark that had learned to be kind. The eel dreamed of wires buzzing the song of high things. The myna dreamed of peanuts again and a footnote in a book that would never be written. The House Wife leaned her broom against the wall and allowed herself one sigh and no others. The Registrar lay down in a bed that had learned her bones and allowed the day to be sorted behind her eyes like papers shuffled by a clerk who believes doing something well is a way of arguing with gods. The old man took off his shirt and stood in the rain and spoke a line of poetry he refused to say in company because it required him to call himself an old name, and the rain forgave him for the vanity.

That night brought no monsters and many decisions. It carried with it letters written and not written, small gifts placed and not mentioned, strings tied and left dangling on purpose. It delivered a sleep in pieces and collected from each bed a promise, not solemn, not binding, simply the sort of promise a person leaves on a windowsill for weather to read and answer if it is in the mood. In the morning the pink lace glowed faintly in a dream and then stopped because the river does not do parables where they can be seen. In the morning the Institute arranged itself around breakfast, which is to say it decided not to be brave until it had swallowed something first. In the morning, a stranger with a hat too new to be owned by anyone sensible stood at the inward water and asked for the Registrar with a voice like a road newly paved and slick with luck. He had a message and a map and a salary, and behind him, drawn out of the air by the rain and mistakes and time, someone’s shadow had learned a new way to be a body.Chapter 10 began with a stranger whose hat had not yet learned rain. He stood at the inward water with his shoes forgetting to be respectful; the leather shone like a promise made to the wrong person. He smelled faintly of new elevator, of paper that had been photocopied seven times until the letters went soft, of cologne that meant career rather than body. Under one elbow was tucked a roll of maps bound with the arrogant rubber band of short deadlines. In the other hand he held an envelope whose weight announced itself the way an official letter knows it can bully a kitchen table into silence. Behind him, coherent as a cousin called upon to assist and sullen for it, a shadow had made itself thick. It was not the rain’s shadow or the tree’s. It had the tidy edges of an architectural drawing and the sulk of a right-of-way newly invented on land where feet had already been. It tried to lean against the posts and kept sliding because it was learning how to be body and had not yet understood hips.

The Registrar met him without hurry and without a different necklace; the buttons at her throat rattled once and then remembered dignity. She looked at the hat and the maps and the shadow and then past them at the rain, which consented to pause because an introduction was occurring. The old man arrived by the simple expedient of stepping into the space where he would be useful and trusting the Institute to sneak the floor under him. Palapaw sat on the edge of the basin with his feet in two waters and allowed his mouth to make a small uninterested shape. The hurricane-haired woman stayed visible on the far side of the Commons, within earshot and within throwing distance of a ladle if needed.

“Good morning,” said the man with the hat, and his voice slid into a lower register for the benefit of the roots as if contracts could impress trees. “I am Engineer Sandoval, Project Liaison for River Rationalization and Resilience Initiative—Phase Three.” He recited the title as if it were a rosary lacking only sin to complete the narrative. “I bring an invitation and—” he lifted the envelope with something that hoped to be flourish and landed as insistence— “a salary.”

“Good morning, Engineer,” the Registrar said, and her good morning had the weight of fruit set down for the house to decide if it is ripe. “Is Phase Three the one that adds a mall where mangroves tire themselves so city children can point at shoes? Or is it the one that remembers the names of four lost creeks laid under parking lots without graves?”

Engineer Sandoval blinked as one who has been asked to count money in a foreign currency while being watched. “Phase Three seeks to stabilize communities at risk,” he said, and he had the decency to believe that sentence most mornings, from eight to five. “We have overflow events. The riv—” he glanced down and caught his tongue in time— “the water has made choices about level that do not favor the barangays. We are re-scripting channels. We are adjusting urban fabric to reduce—” He found himself saying the word pain and shoved it back into the mouth of his training. “We think the Institute could assist. In exchange, we can make it worth your time.” He held out the envelope.

“We do not take coin,” the Registrar said gently, as if correcting a child who said dove when the bird in question was a small hen with delusions. “We take recipes and breaths and jokes and the occasional knot tied with fidelity. Also, we invoice in favors owed to rivers and in the currency of not-dying.”

“It’s a salary,” Sandoval repeated, because the word had a charm he had relied on since he had begun to measure his meals by payscale. “It would be regular. If you do not wish checks, there are gift cards. We want to—” He stopped because the shadow behind him had shifted and one of its shoulders had decided inexplicably to be a hand, and the hand had reached toward his sleeve with the blind curiosity of unowned things.

“It follows you,” the old man observed, not unkind and not interested in embarrassment. “Is that yours by appointment or by inheritance?”

Engineer Sandoval rubbed his forearm as if to smooth a gooseflesh that had decided to read minutes out loud. “It came,” he admitted, surprising himself by telling the truth without the usual preface about meetings. “Since the reclamation started in the south, anything I stand in casts that on the ground. My uncle says it is the city asking me to sit down and my boss says it is a problem with optics. The interns tried to photograph it for the press release, but it does not show up in the day. At noon it dissolves. At four it is very insistent. At night it stands at the foot of my bed like something that does not know the difference between a man and his waking.”

“The shadow was a creek,” the myna said helpful as a tax, flitting down to the back of a chair and cocking his head to view the map roll as if it contained peanuts. “Now it is your conscience. It will want to be put back where it goes or it will find itself a child with teeth along its spine and we will all have to pretend to be surprised.”

“We do not feed the bird,” muttered the hurricane-haired woman, and the myna preened the question of seeds from his shoulder and threw it on the air like confetti.

Amihan had come, and Ines, because invitations with maps are like sugar to those who cannot keep their hands clean of futures. Tiya hovered near the doorway with her jar steadying its breath, and the eel-boy’s eel had decided the rain was interesting enough to watch as if it were television. The Estuary students stood where they could receive a task and where a glance would tell them this would be not merely task but lesson. Sandoval took them in not with dismissal but with cataloguing, a habit he had learned from floors that wanted to know how many bodies to hold. He saw a girl with a bronze hook and a seed where a ring should be and the look of someone who had made a bargain with a flood and liked the bargain. He saw another with a bundle of cheeses wrapped in the humility of a banana leaf and the audacity of cave. He realized he had not brought a power outlet for what he wanted to plug into.

“Engineer,” the Registrar said quietly, and because quiet often invites ear, he leaned forward as if to catch it. “You said salary. Sahod is a fine word. In our city, sahod is also to catch something that falls. Sahod-ulan is what my lola did with a basin on the veranda because roofs are polite to basins when rain arrives. We have no use for your checks. We have much use for your rooftops.”

“Rooftops?” He repeated it in the tone of a man who has been asked to count stairs that had not existed when he climbed.

“You will make a promise to teach your buildings to sahod rather than to spit,” she said crisply, the buttons at her throat smiling suddenly into the room. “Your salary will be tin tubs, gutters taught courtesy, jars placed where they will not be only decorative. Your map will be returned with rivers drawn on it that did not pass your intern’s eyes. You will knock holes in walls where water remembers a door. In return, we will escort what is tired of being a shadow into work. We will show you where you have named pain efficiency. You will scold less and listen more.”

Sandoval’s face did a thing that would have resembled offense if his sister had not drowned six monsoons ago when the bridge he had designed was still a ribbon being cut and the ribbon had dragged her into the water because everything in the city is connected to ceremony even when ceremony doesn’t know where it puts its feet. He held the envelope out another inch and then lowered it and tucked it under his arm, not because he agreed but because the act of stubbornness began to embarrass his elbow. “I can show you,” he said, and he glanced at the shadow like one glances at a child in the next room who might be listening to secrets and might be asleep and either is perilous. “There is a place. The wind is behaving improperly at the corner of a building that was not yet there in the plans I signed. There has been one fall. It is my fault, which I am not allowed to admit in writing. I do not know what kind of apology to make to air.”

The old man looked at the bird-man, who tilted his head in the way of his other body, and then at the Registrar, who had already put away her refusal as if she were filing it where she could retrieve it later. “Bring your shadow,” she told Engineer Sandoval. “And bring two interns with eyes not yet convinced they know what scaffolding looks like. We will come and we will watch the corners with you. We will bring basins. We will bring cheese. We will bring a joke unwrapped on a day when the rain needs to lose face to remember itself.”

They went not fast, because speed around new foolishness is merely salt in the wrong hands, but without wasted time. Palapaw took them by the unwilling waterways that buildings leave when obliged to pretend to talk to rivulets; their passage made ladders bow and gutters hold their breath and alleys lay down their little gossip to listen to big gossip. The shadow behind Sandoval lengthened and learned where to put its weight on turns; twice it risked stepping into other people, and twice Ines distracted it with the complicated allegiance of rind so it would lean toward patience rather than invasion. Amihan walked with the blunt nail in her pocket and touched it as one touches a thought to find out if it has cooled enough to tell.

The site rose constructed and offended. Its bones were cranes that believed themselves condors. tarpaulins flapped with the names of companies who were shy of putting their sins under their own names. On one corner where glass had learned to hold its breath in large squares and pretend to be sky, a wind slid down the wall and found the new plaza and decided that it would play there; it curled and dropped and smacked and spiralled as if buildings were children without chaperones. There were tape outlines on the concrete where a body had landed and been removed. The tape had peeled up at one corner and now flipped in the wind, a hinge that did not know what door it belonged to.

“This is where,” Sandoval said unnecessarily, and his shadow stood up as if raising a hand and then halting because it had been told to sit. He drew out one map and then another and overlayed them on a toolbox whose locks had rusted politely shut. The lines showed a vision of streets that would be decorated like a cake; none of them showed the narrow thread of a creek that had once cut this way across the corner, the one that had carried women’s talk and pelting laughter and the slipperiness of fish scaled on steps and washed back into water without apology. The old creek sulked under poured cement with the patience of rocks.

“Your building is being rude to a river that had been forgotten and pretended to be okay about it,” the Registrar announced, adjusting a hairpin. “The wind is merely translating. We will tell the building what to say instead.”

The Sky teacher climbed like a bird and found that at the forty-seventh handhold the gust said liar and at the forty-eighth it said hold me, and he came down smelling of glass’s jealousy. Apo Sili stood on the tape outline and took the measure of the empty and knelt and pressed the flat of his hand to the ground and told a story about the time the monsoon came without its temper and the gutters forgot to be insulting and it became a laugh that made the kind of sense only old women accept. The eel-boy kept his eel on his head and the eel peered through a mesh with eyes that claimed letters. Tiya set her jar on a stack of bricks and gently reminded the air of names it had said once for a baby and had never said again.

There is a charm in the way engineers who have been made afraid behave when confronted with work that admits them and will not be tamed. Sandoval tried to speak bracingly and then found his voice was the wrong thickness and let the Institute set the tone. He approached the inward corner where two glossy walls made a mouth that sucked and slashed. He lifted a hand and the shadow reached an arm past his and touched the glass. The glass flinched with an arrogance that made Ines’s lip pull at one side in a motion that would have been a sneer if she had been less disciplined. “Permit,” the shadow said, and it was a word spoken by paper and yet it contained the ache of water. “Permit,” it repeated with less authority and more want.

“Do not tell windows to permit,” the old man advised, amused and sorrowing. “Tell wind to borrow. Windows are terrible magistrates. Wind makes better bargains.”

Amihan took her blunted nail and, with the frankness she reserved for men who interrupted her mother, placed its head against the seam where the two walls kissed like bad cousins. “Excuse,” she said to the seam, and then because there are things only apologies can open, she added, “I am sorry you were made by a tired mind.” The seam softened microscopically, which is the only scale that matters in such matters. She pushed the nail in just enough to make a new path for guilt. The wind tried the path, found that it tasted like work rather than victory, and calmed. It turned into a draft, one of those faithful house winds that know where to pass without making a scene, like an aunt who hates your uncle but still brings pancit to his birthday.

Ines took from her bundle a small jar that would have frightened a timid priest and comforted a fisherman. She unwrapped it and the smell came out like a choir that had been told to modulate and was prettily refusing. She dipped her finger and drew a thin line of culture along the lip of the new seam, not enough to make the building confess, just enough to teach it to speak an older courtesy. “You will want to whine,” she told the mouth of the corner, voice quiet and imperious at the same time, an heir’s voice made gentle by travel. “You will practice exhaling like humility instead. We do not make museums of mistakes. We feed them and send them to school.”

The interns Sandoval had brought watched without pretending they were not watching. One had a safety vest two sizes too large and eyes that learned from ankles first. The other carried a tablet in both hands as if it were an egg. When the wind changed its behavior, each made a note—the first in the way his shoulders dropped, the second with a stylus. When the old creek cleared its throat under them in the way old things do when they want to be invited back into conversation, both looked at the Registrar, and then at Sandoval, and then at the place where the creek’s spine had been taught to be a slab, and both flushed with the shame of being told a thing too late and the relief of being told at all.

“Let’s see your salary,” the Registrar said suddenly, pivoting before Engineer Sandoval could return to the safety of plans and CAD anxieties. “Do your buildings know how to sahod? Show me a roof with permission to catch.”

Sandoval faltered and then remembered a demonstration module he had proposed once in a meeting and been laughed out of in the kind of laughter that selects its victim and then congratulates itself for its efficiency. He led them to a lower roof near the site office where a lip gave on a view of tarpaulins and taped-off rain. There was a shallow trough with no conviction to it and a drain that would swallow anything and tell no one. “We could—” He began, and then he stopped because this was a day for verbs that did not object to direct objects. “We will.”

They set pots where instructors would have set problems. The hurricane-haired woman, who had insisted on coming at the last moment because a kitchen knows when it will be needed to translate, produced from her bag a battered salaan, the kind of strainer that believes in the intimacy of flour and water. She set it to sit over the mouth of the drain and braided a strip of old cloth around its neck so it would not slip. Tiya lifted her jar and let one breath into the trough and the breath spread the way oil spreads when invited by the right heat; it gave the rain something to find. Palapaw climbed to the lip like a cat and clipped a line that was not a rope to an anchor that was not an anchor and then leaned back and taught the line to carry weight politely. The Sky teacher stood with his arms out just enough to taste the direction and was silent.

The first of the rain that the trough caught went down the salaan with the satisfaction of nuts falling to the bottom of pockets. The rest pooled, and the pool was allowed to be a child for three breaths and then picked up by two hands and poured into a barrel that had belonged to oil in another life and now wanted to please a new god. Ines bent and dipped two fingers into the barrel and smiled because the taste was half dust and half apology and both were fixable. She lifted the lid of a small jar and released a colony into the dark that squealed with gratitude.

“You will put one of these on every roof,” the Registrar told Sandoval in a voice that did not raise itself but raised the hairs on the back of his ambition. “You will sahod your offices, your malls, your empty beautiful plazas. You will teach your guards to listen for the sigh that tells them a barrel is tired of watching itself and wants to be emptied into the plantings you will remember to plant. You will put signs in markets that say rainwater here and you will put buckets we approve of under those signs. You will teach the worship of gutters that do not spit.”

Sandoval put the envelope down and placed his palm on the barrel as if swearing allegiance to a kingdom he had previously thought of as an unincorporated region. He thought of his sister, who had once saved coins in a jar all week and then poured them out on Sunday onto the table and counted, the metal making a music he had come to equate with safety. He understood then that he had been asking the city to pay him and the city had instead been asking to be caught. “Sahod,” he said, and the word moved through him and found the place in his chest where both salary and catching had set up their little shops, and it laughed at their rivalry and made them share customers.

Meanwhile the shadow had nudged closer to the interns and tried one of their shoes on with the hesitance of something that has never been allowed to own a sole. It slipped and sat down in the way assessments sit down when they turn into stories. Amihan crouched and looked into the shadow and saw, as if through a zipper tooth, a street where once women had rinsed molehills of rice and the water had become milky and then clear and had carried with it laughter that made cups of hands. She set the blunted nail on the shadow’s knee and pressed once, not to hurt, but to make it aware it had a knee. Ines held out the smallest smear of paste on the end of a thorn and the shadow sniffed and, to their collective surprise, wrinkled its nose at the rumor of barn and cave and refused. It put its hand on the ground instead, palm flat like a pledge. The old creek knocked under the slab like a polite guest.

“We will give it a job,” the old man said, because sometimes the only thing left to do with a ghost is to put it on payroll. “Not your payroll. Ours. It will walk with your interns and point at corners and say dangerous in a voice even soft boys will obey. It will carry umbrellas and refuse to be charmed. It will insist on barrels and find the places where your drains are performing politics instead of physics. You will learn to say thank you to a shadow in public. This will be difficult for you. Try.”

“I will,” Sandoval said, and to his credit his mouth did not try to add conditions. His eyes went to the tape outline and he did not look away out of superstition; he looked away because his throat hurt. “You will—” He gestured toward the Institute, unable to frame what he wanted: not contracting, not consulting, not magic. The word teacher hovered and was shy.

“We will witness,” the Registrar said. “We will say no when you ask us to clean the cameras instead of the gutters. We will say yes when a child with a bowl needs to know where to stand to make an adult remember how to move their feet. We will be inconvenient and then useful and then inconvenient again. This is friendship.”

They returned to the Institute wetter and dirtier and slightly richer in the kind of wealth that fits under a fingernail and cannot be taxed. On the boat, Ines unwrapped a slice so thin you could see the boatman’s grin through it and laid it on her palm and allowed the rain to kiss it and then offered it to Amihan with an expression that, in an island where taste and weapon are two names stitched to the same strap, is courtship of a sort and also truce. “For courage,” she said in a tone indifferent enough not to be accused of intimacy and so intimate that the eel-boy blushed by mistake. “And for the lesson you paid with an old word.”

Amihan took the slice and held it under her nose first because certain things deserve to be smelled into speech before the tongue is allowed to be a judge. The aroma went up and made a shape in her head that resembled her mother’s list of groceries and her father’s list of repairs and the ledger the Registrar had used to count the first day’s students. It tasted like resistance becoming recipe. It tasted like a market flooded at knee and laughing anyway. It tasted faintly of hands that had learned to carry without owning. “For bargains,” she agreed, and let the slice dissolve across her mouth and made no face because becoming adults meant learning to keep your faces out of the way of your tongue.

That evening the Commons took their wet back into themselves and wrung it out the way one wrings scoldings out of a day. The hurricane-haired woman served something that had had the good sense to be gabí and the wildness to be coconut and a tiny whisper of whatever Ines had given the barrels, which is how kitchens revolutionize cities while pretending to be about lunch. The myna perched with his tail toward his audience and pronounced that he had invented sahod and had not been appreciated, and when no one threw him a peanut he shifted to telling a story about when he had been a typhoon’s secretary and had edited out its adjectives. “He lies,” the eel-boy told his eel fondly, and the eel touched the boy’s lip with its own in the nearest thing to a kiss that an eel can be persuaded to attempt within the bounds of decency.

Back in the Estuary House, the House Wife took one look at the damp footprints they had stamped on her floor and clucked and then, because she was not a tyrant, pushed her broom through them in long strokes that preserved the pattern and erased the wet, so that memory would be kept without mildew. The seed on Amihan’s shelf rolled to press its back against the blunted nail as if to learn a posture. The knot of vine in Ines’s pocket warmed to body temperature and began very subtly to teach her how to pull when pushing was traditional. Tiya drew a line of chalk around her jar that had more fancy to it than the day she had first drawn it and then scuffed three places on purpose to let in the necessary mistakes that keep rituals honest.

When dawn slipped a hand into the room, the shadow that had followed Engineer Sandoval leaned in the doorway like a cousin who is thinking of moving to the city. It had acquired a hat; not Sandoval’s, which had gone home with its owner and a new way to be useful, but a shadow-hat shaped by buildings. It saluted with an awkwardness that would one day make old ladies love it. “Work,” it said, and the word was less paper and more breath than the day before, and everybody understood that language lessons take best when the teacher is weather.

The Institute received visitors that week who would have drafted another school into pamphlets and favors; preachers with mouths full of air; councilors with palms full of apology; a woman in a dress like rainfall who had come to ask where to set her protest that would not drown in the schedule. The Registrar turned each encounter into a bowl to be filled, refusing to be rude and refusing to be used. The old man sat during an hour of sun in a patch of it and allowed his bones to be rented by heat and confessed to no one that he had once wanted to be a storm and had instead become a timetable.

The message came from the south with its own salt, joggling on the shoulder of a man whose hat was not new and whose wrists had been taught obedience by rope. He had a word from a seaside town that had decided to build a wall against the sea and had discovered the sea was good at ladders. He had brought a map of a coast with a mouth shaped like regret. He had the sober self-respect of those who sell fish and memory. “We need a school that will be rude to us and then love us,” he said, and the Registrar smiled because this was exactly their ministry. On the veranda, Ines shaved a slice that was almost nothing from a wheel and tucked it into a small jar of rain and coaxed a civilization to take a breath on a boat. Below, on the root where the Estuary students liked to tie things into being temporarily safe, Amihan bent over a basin and taught it how to receive, which is all any sahod is.

It would have been enough, that week, to be exhausted and believe in the kind of mercy that comes with soup. But the city is generous with trouble when it thinks you have grown flattered by your competence. On the afternoon of the seventh day after Engineer Sandoval had learned the other meaning of his salary, a child ran up the inside path with a lizard on a string and announced at the top of her chest that an alley had developed teeth. She insisted it was biting the backs of bicycles and refusing cats passage. “It is eating shade,” she said, eyes huge and indignant. “It is eating shade that is not its own. The men who play tong-its cannot see their cards and they are blaming the batteries of their lamps and not the teeth and this is an injustice.”

“Teeth again,” the Registrar murmured, pinning her hair tighter, and the old man looked at Apo Sili, who looked at his knife and sighed because even the kindest objects get bored when left in pockets too long. Palapaw loosed the boat with a thought and the boat made a sound like a dog being told it was good. Tiya picked up her jar which vibrated once like a voice clearing its throat. Ines tucked her paste and a clean leaf and a small spoon into her bag with the tapped patience of a child packing for school and reluctant to admit she likes it. Amihan reached for the hook and the nail and spoke the small prayer of those who intend to ask nicely of a street. The myna flapped after them shrilling, “I told you, shade is currency,” and then, because he is what he is, fell silent and listened for where the alley had set its jaw.

The city, flattering itself that it had invented new afflictions, made a show of the alley with teeth. There along the cinderblock walls where cables drooped like exhausted vines, between sari-sari stores that argued in color about which instant noodle is more patriotic, the narrowness had acquired a bite. There were marks on plaster as if some cautious animal had tested the flavor of paint and found it unconvincing. Bicycles leaned at nervous angles and the cats were at the mouth of the alley, ears like question marks, unwilling to be offended and unwilling to forgive. The shade had been redistributed; places where old men had allowed their shoulders to cool now simmered, and places that had been dangerous now had a thin generosity.

“It is the building,” said a woman in a duster, folding her arms, as defense against both rain and men, into her body. “The new one they put up two streets over. It took shade from here and put it on the swimming pool. My plants are sulking. They do not understand english.”

“Shade theft,” the myna exclaimed, thrilled at the occasion to be moral, and then ruined his effect by tipping his head and whispering to a small boy, “You can charge rent to the sun if you can get his attention,” and the boy laughed in a way that made his mother look for a slipper and then decide against it.

“We will not put teeth in jail,” the Registrar declared briskly, kneeling to touch the marks on plaster and then patting the wall the way one pats the thigh of a dog who has been reminded to sit. “We will borrow shade from the guilty and return it to the offended. We will ask the alley to open its mouth for a snack and then convince it to go to bed. This is logistics.”

They strung lines between the walls with the easy competence of people who have made clotheslines that hold more than shirts. The eel-boy set his eel in a basin under the line to make the water lively so the heat would come down to investigate. Tiya breathed into the corner where a poster of a singer had half torn and hung like a wounded bird. Ines unfolded a parasol made from a discarded banner that had once celebrated a real estate development and wrote with paste in a script that would peel clean the words we borrow and set it over a stool where boys liked to sit and pretend not to watch girls. Amihan planted her heel at the threshold and said to the alley, “We will give you this basin. You may put your teeth here. You may chew the cool like sugarcane. You will leave the cats alone. You will eschew bicycles.” The alley, which had never been told please by anyone in its life, opened its mouth and released a small hot sigh that smelled like frying banana and cancelled lotto tickets. It bit the basin and sulked. It did not bite the cats.

When they had arranged the cloth and the lines and the small pools that trick heat into slipping its leash, they walked to the building two streets over where a man in a shirt too white for the street and a smile too ready for the camera stood at the edge of a pool that had been given a fence with pretensions. “You are stealing,” the Registrar informed the building, and because there are days lawyers should be permitted to rest and let grammar carry the load, she did not add from whom and therefore accused everyone on purpose. The building, which was only on its first months of love and had not yet learned shame, boiled in a deeper blue and tried to make dimples in the water for the sake of its Instagram. Ines took out a clean leaf and wrote the building a letter in salt about the ethics of shade. Apo Sili showed the building the back of his knife and did not threaten; he promised to sharpen manners. Palapaw stuck both arms out and mimed being breeze in a place unused to generosity and the guards, who were not paid enough to consider this poetry, opened their mouths to tell him to stop and then closed them because their throats had been politely occupied by a surprise.

At the end of that day when cats went down the alley without hunch and boys played tong-its under a parasol written with an argument about fairness, when the building was persuaded to give up a sliver of afternoon and place it in a corner that had been bad at shade since 1972, and when Engineer Sandoval’s shadow came to stand at the edge and said work in a tone that suggested it had begun to understand weekend, the Institute went back across its own threshold and marked in a ledger made of bark and grease that the city had not killed anyone they knew today and several things had been taught to go home with the right parent.

In the Estuary House that night, after the House Wife had combed the day’s sand out of the mats with a proud hand and the myna had fallen off the windowsill and recovered his dignity by insulting the moon’s grammar, Ines and Amihan sat with their backs in parallel against the same root and shared a pocket bread someone had stolen legally. The seed in the notch by the hook had cracked infinitesimally and would make a new argument tomorrow. The knot of vine had cooled and would be warm again when next it was needed to be competent. The blunted nail had left one speck of iron on the seam of a building that would release it into the rain in a few days when the seam forgot why it had been softened and remembered again with the politeness of decay.

“Your word is better than mine,” Ines said finally, unwilling to name it a confession because confessions should be saved for capitals, and Amihan tilted her head, unsure which word the girl from caves meant. “Salary,” Ines clarified, the syllables a dome in her mouth that the rain would approve. “Sahod. It catches. My island pays in cheese; your city pays in rain. Both mold magnificently.”

“Your milk taught our barrel to be a city,” Amihan replied, refusing to be less lyrical than necessary. “My river taught your jar to be patient. We will make the wind pay interest.”

They laughed softly, not to avoid waking anyone, but because there is no point in startling a night that has been good to you. Somewhere above, the great myna, who could not help being comic even when life was profound, blew his nose on a leaf and swore at a dream in which a peanut had sold him to a hurricane. Somewhere below, the river and the tree arranged their furniture, just enough to inconvenience no one and warn everyone that tomorrow would require our talents again.
