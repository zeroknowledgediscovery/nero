The freight trains wandered through Mooresville at odd hours, great groaning serpents dragging their iron bodies through the night. When the horn sighed and rolled over the rooftops, it pulled a wake of static out of the street lamps and the power lines—sprinkles of stray electricity, whispers of mechanical dreams. Imri was there to catch them, hands cupped, eyes narrowed against the dark. It was a game he had perfected: drift above the red-brick depot, let the radio noise rise from the rails, and gather it as it hushed the evening into something almost musical.

He was not much longer than a bluejay from wingtip to wingtip, and thinner than a warm blade of grass, yet he made a stillness in the air when he hovered. His wings were mothish and edged with softened gold, as though he had dipped them in the end of a candle. He wore a shirt cut from an old receipt book that rustled when he moved, a belt of monofilament line that glowed in the near dark. His hair—well, it never remembered what he told it to do, a small storm of moss and soot and something like moon. He smiled down at the ballast along the rails, and the bolt jars he kept clipped to his belt rattled as he lowered the bundle of static into one of them.

“There you go,” he told the jar. “Behave.”

Few sprites in Mooresville had little jars with lightning sleeping inside. Few sprites believed such things could be coaxed, shaped to do more than sting. But Imri had a way with stubborn magic. It sat in his hand like a tame wasp, and fizzled politely when he tapped the glass.

“I know you’re up there,” called a voice from the eave of the depot. “I can smell your silvertongue tricks.”

Imri tilted his head. The voice had the state fair in it, and the end of summer: careless and loud. He drifted toward the eave, moving sideways, cautious. The wooden rafters carried old candle smoke from the days the depot had been someone’s wedding venue; now it was haunted by paper streamers and the shape of remembered dancing. He liked that smell. He did not like the one perched in the shadow between signage and roof.

Vireo swung his boots over the edge—green boots, polished to a smirk. He had painted his wings that evening, it seemed, a bright slash of blue on each translucent panel. He was a head taller than Imri, which is a remarkable height at thirteen inches, and wore his knife on the outside of his thigh so it would always show. A steel pin from a human shirt cuff held his hair back. On anyone else it would have been a charming spare part. On Vireo it was a declaration. He lifted two fingers to his brow as if in salute, not meaning it.

“I thought I felt the air getting cleaner,” Imri said, because words had to be used as tools sometimes. “Turns out it was just you arriving with a head full of your own wind.”

Vireo grinned in a stretch of pale teeth. “You would know about wind. I heard about your little trick at the lamp behind Mrs. Daley’s lavender. Siphoning the blink out of old bulbs, teaching yourself to twist light. That’s the kind of thing that makes elders’ tongues wag. Imri, the boy with jars.”

“I’ve jars for the things that want keeping,” Imri said. “We can leave your talk out in the open. It’ll keep itself.”

“Sharp.” Vireo leaned back, balanced with an ease that irritated Imri for reasons he couldn’t quite name. “We could use a little sharpness on the Attic Parliament tonight. I wonder if you’ll be there. There’s to be a demonstration, a small contest, a mmm—” he pinched and rolled the word, enjoying it— “a proving. They say the Second Thread over the creek has gone faint. One of us can fix it. The names on everyone’s lips are mine, and yours.”

Imri felt the trains somewhere behind him, the iron groan pulled through the evening like breath through a reed. “The Thread’s bleeding over the creek?” His chest tightened. The Threads were the straightened forms of the town’s luck. Every village had some, all of them spun from old stories and anchored in quiet places: the underside of bridges, churchyard boundaries, the seam between thrift stores and their alleys. The Second Thread over Back Creek had been his since spring. It was what kept the bridge from making shadows that frightened the old ones; what kept the rain calm when it fell over the swing set at the park. If it was thinning—

Vireo caught the flicker across Imri’s face and rolled it between finger and thumb. “Oh, did no one tell you? How rude.” He rose, light on the eave. “You’ll come. Or you’ll send one of your jars to argue. Either way. I’ll be there. I’m expected.”

“You mean you’ve told everyone to expect you.”

“You say that as if it isn’t the same thing.” He stepped off the eave and fell, wings flicking, and caught the air so gently the dust over the parking lot didn’t stir.

Imri hovered against the eave and watched him go. The jar warmed against his palm. Be careful, it hummed faintly. Be careful. He jammed it back onto his belt and scooped up two more bits of wayward static, the way a child might pick lightning bugs from a field. “We’ll see,” he said, to himself, to the jar, to whatever Thread was listening.

The Attic Parliament gathered where it always did: third floor, above an antique shop whose sign insisted on correcting everyone’s grammar. The attic had been almost nothing once, a crammed wedge beneath a roof, the home of dead umbrellas and uncomplaining dust. Then the shopkeeper, a woman with patient hands, had posted photographs from streets only she remembered, and people started visiting to buy doorknobs and photograph frames with neighbors’ faces already in them. The attic warmed with human up-breath. It fattened like bread. It made a haunt, which made a parliament.

Imri eased through a window whose latch never held. He folded and let his wings settle along his spine. Lights in mismatched jars hung from rafters on old string, casting tea-stained glow. Sprites had made seats out of the curled tin siding of a long-demolished shed. The elders were there—Kinna-de-Feather who wore her age like river-worn glass, and Master Oakes with a beard made of the filaments from broomgrass, and the twins, Pash and Pash, who no one could tell apart even if one had been three quarters of an inch taller since 1912. A dozen others leaned and murmured, faces turned to the new arrivals—some human; a family that could only feel the Parliament without seeing it, breathing the way the room told them to, pausing at the same moments the sprites paused, sensing the hush the way one senses rain.

Junebug waved near the roof. She wore a dress cut from a scrap of sky-blue plastic tablecloth and had pressed wild violet petals into her hair. Next to her sat a boy human with his legs dangling over a trunk. He was ten and he went by Squid—his own choice, Imri had asked—and he had a notebook and a pencil and that particular stare of kids who would let the world explain itself but only if they got to line up the pencils beforehand.

Junebug pattered down the beam and landed easily. “Have you already heard? And did you bring me something to snack on? No, fine, you probably didn’t. It’s just that when the Parliament meets, my stomach thinks it’s immunologically entitled to boiled peanuts, and—”

“The Thread over Back Creek,” Imri said. “Is it thinning? How long?”

“Four nights. Master Oakes wants to watch another night. Kinna says the sheen of it is not right. I say it tastes like nicotine and funk.” Junebug wrinkled her nose and still somehow smiled. “I found a button carved with a heart that I think belongs to you. You always think yours look like that.”

“I think hearts look like hearts,” Imri said.

“Exactly,” Junebug replied, which did not clarify anything.

The elders called the Parliament to order with the old spell of tapping three times on wood, three on glass, three on bone. “We are all present,” said Kinna, though she never counted precisely, because attendance was also a story, and it was better to speak the story you wanted in a voice that sounded like you trusted it. “News. The creek. It drifts. It forgets itself.”

“It is laced with something,” Master Oakes said, pulling a thread of air and stretching it between his hands. It shone, then fluctuated, then softened like taffy being warmed. “Some weight. Not the weight of iron. Something like…selfishness with corners.”

Sprites murmured. Selfishness had taste. It was like biting the edge of a teaspoon. It felt both sticky and brittle.

“And there is a challenger.” Kinna’s eyes skimmed. “Vireo of the trimmed boot and the heavy mouth has declared himself steward of the Second Thread. He says the Thread listens to confidence. He says the Thread is attracted to greatness.”

Junebug snorted, and it was nearly indelicate, which delighted her. “He says that every thread and roof tile and groundhog listens to him. He’s probably threatened a storm today—the storm did not blink. Why are we giving him a stage?”

“Because he is tall,” Master Oakes said dryly, “and because humans are making new things down by the tire shop that bring unfamiliar fumes into the creek, and because even an arrogant mouth can sometimes hold a true tooth. We will see what he shows. And—” he turned his attention on Imri, and there was warmth in it, and something else that didn’t sit quite so easily— “because the Thread is yours by courtesy, Imri of the lightning jars. Your first and best attempt should be the one we hear before we listen to a second.”

Dozens of eyes touched Imri softly. It prickled his shoulders; it smoothed his hair. He wanted to look away and didn’t. “I will show,” he said. And, because it mattered to say such things aloud, “I will keep the Thread bright.” The words left his tongue and walked along the rafters, calm and sure. They lay down among the things the Parliament believed.

Vireo had taken a position on the crossbeam just where the ceiling bent. He had gotten there by pushing someone else aside, but he had done it so gracefully everyone forgot to be annoyed. He wrapped his fingers around the beam and said, “I will show as well, after the local boy’s attempt. If he fails—”

“When,” corrected someone unseen in the dark.

Vireo smiled at the air. “When he does his attempt in full and we are left with the same ribcage of a Thread, then I will replace it with a spine.”

“It’s not broken,” Junebug whispered to Imri, which also did not clarify anything, though it felt like comfort.

Back Creek was not much in summer. In winter it had something to brag about, hard rain with a quick temper, water that grabbed its banks and demanded to be told a story. But when the heat came, it learned to speak quietly. Moss made small countries along its edges. The bridge over it was human-built, heavy concrete on four thick legs, an old thing stubborn enough to have outlasted several different brands of chewing gum.

Imri stood on the bend of the bridge that no one watched. The night was not yet deep; the chorus of insects made the air seem full of lace. He could smell river fish and car oil and the wax of someone’s apple slice they had set down and lost forever. It was familiar. It made his bones remember childhood before he had entirely finished experiencing it.

“Your Thread,” said Vireo. He had dressed since the attic: more paint on his wings, a sliver of mirror suspended against his chest, a chain of blue bottle caps like a mayor’s collar. The mirror reflected darkness into Imri’s eyes, which was a trick and unfair, but also simple to deflect—Imri looked away, at the concrete.

“It is not mine,” Imri said softly. “It is ours and not even ours, really. It belongs to the stories that wake up when people are quiet near the water.”

“That’s what I said,” Vireo replied, “but faster.” He slid down the railing and hung upside down by his knees, which was an unnecessary display of trust in his own skill. “Do the thing, Imri. Whisper. Twist. Make the air pretend to listen. I will correct you after.”

Imri unclasped one of his jars and tapped it with his tooth. The static inside glowed and balanced on the glass edge like dew. He let it spill, a slow luminous veil over his hands. He’d learned to pluck the sparks like dandelions; each made a sound if coaxed right—glass, bell, chime, note—whichever he told it to be. He flicked notes into the concrete. He set chimes ringing in the spaces concatenated between the bridge and the air. He said three small words for protection: one in the language of bees, one in the old cadence of copper coins, one in his grandmother’s tongue which had no human name. The Thread that wove along the underside of the bridge trembled, visible only as a feeling: that pull you get under your ribs when you hear your own name from a long distance. He sang to it. The sparkle of the static folded itself into the tremble and stayed, quick-pinned like a moth. The Thread grew less gray. He spoke to the creek, to the stones beneath it, to the water rustling over cattail roots. The Thread lifted its head. The Thread remembered.

“I don’t know why you do everything as if an audience needs new adjectives,” Vireo said, pushing off and landing so his toes nearly brushed the water. “There. I will show you how a Thread enjoys proper attention.” He spread his hands at the creek like a general blessing an army.

He didn’t touch a jar. He didn’t seem to carry anything at all, no bits of glass or folded string. He breathed out. He smiled, and he made a word of that smile and put it into the water. He spoke a longer word his throat did not appear large enough to hold. The creek shivered and the Thread sat up straighter. It stretched to see him. He wasn’t weaving; he wasn’t knotting. He was telling the Thread that if it wanted to please him, it should look like he liked his own reflection. The Thread did—not out of love, but out of a curious kind of hunger. It pulled toward him. It gleamed. It was not right. But it looked whole, if you didn’t know how to look.

“I keep what needs keeping,” Imri said. He glanced up. The sky was a shallow bowl. The stars were doing their best to be remembered. “If you make the Thread look like you, who eats when you leave?”

“I stay.” Vireo’s mouth shaped the words with the ease of the faithless. “Or I teach the water to miss me. That is almost the same thing.”

Junebug, who had come with Squid and Master Oakes and three elderly sprites who had been rivers once, said from the railing, “I have never seen a Thread preen like that. I am tempted to throw bread on it.”

“Bread is for ducks, Junebug,” Master Oakes said gently. “Adoration we can give to each other without stale carbohydrate.”

Imri bit down on irritation and spoke another three words, this time in reverse: copper, bees, grandmother. He drew the Thread slightly away from Vireo’s basking presence. It snapped back like a nerve. He watched the movement carefully. At the heart of it there was a shimmer that did not belong. He had seen such shimmer once before, and the memory of it was not pleasant. It tasted like sugar left too long on the tongue in a heat that made you sick, and envy the color of spilled antifreeze in puddles.

Vireo caught him staring at the shimmer and smiled. Which was interesting, that he knew exactly where to look. “Look,” he said, and turned his palms outward. “See how obedient it is when asked properly. It wants to be wanted. You, Imri, make it think about rules.”

“Rules are one way of not falling into the creek headfirst,” Junebug said in a stage whisper, and Squid snorted into his notebook.

The elders conferred under their breaths. Kinna’s voice carried over them: “We have seen. We will meet tomorrow night. The Thread will hold. We will decide the stewardship then.” She looked at Imri, and there was some sorrow there, and something else like a warning. She looked at Vireo, and there was almost nothing in the look at all, which meant she had put everything she felt away where he could not use it. “Mind your footfalls when you cross the bridge.”

They turned homeward in drifts and eddies. Vireo made sure he flew low enough that Imri could see the gleam on his wings. He made sure he was last across, so the night could watch him and know he had been the last to leave.

Imri did not go home. He walked under the bridge, not above it. He let his hands slide along the concrete. He listened at the seam where the bridge pressed into earth. He bent and pressed his ear to water and say it quietly— “I am sorry, did he hurt you—are you feeling strange—?”

The water wore no eyes but it had moods. It sulked a little, then stopped when it realized this was Imri and he would not tell it to stop sulking if it needed to. “There’s something,” he murmured. “I smell a mark.” He did. It was not a smell with the nose. It was as if his bones had noses; as if his skin sniffed the corner he stood in. His shoulder blades tasted the smell. Odd. Ridiculous. True.

He pushed aside drooping cattails with a toe and saw it: under the lip of concrete, scratched very faint into the skin of the bridge, a mark. It wasn’t one of theirs. Their marks tended to be circles with symbols inside, or scripts you could see because they were full of laughs. This was a clean slice of a thing: a line with a hook at one end and a twist at the other. Looked like a fish hook if the fish hook had read a book about calling things by their wrong names and fallen in love. He didn’t have a word for it. But he knew handwriting when he saw it, and this was Vireo’s. He took out the tiniest hatchet he owned—a ceremonial thing, a no-you-don’t—touched the mark and felt it shiver against the metal.

“So that’s the trick,” he said. “You’re telling the Thread to mirror you by making a place. You’re telling it you live here.” He ground the words between his teeth for a while. “You’re not from Mooresville. You can’t just cut your name on it and say you’re the bridge’s best friend.”

No answer, except the mildew, which was not known for diplomacy. He stood, wiping damp earth onto the side of his pants, and saw an eye gleaming at him: not a fish. A raccoon had decided some of his foolishness was interesting.

“You can come closer,” Imri told it. “I didn’t bring anything to share except marvels.” The raccoon blinked, decided this was fair, and scuttled away to more pragmatic middens.

Imri sat until his pants wicked water up to his knees. He listened to three more trains and waited for stillness to be still enough to tell him anything. It told him this: the Thread had been well. Then it had been touched by Vireo’s trick, which was not really a trick so much as a graft, a clever wound. The Thread had liked the sensation. That worried Imri more than anything. Threads weren’t supposed to like anything. They were not supposed to be appetites. They were a place that held things steady. Someone had taught this Thread to want.

His grandmother had said once, long ago, that want could be turned into a map. “You can follow it,” she’d told him, when he’d been small enough to live in a nest made of one human scarf. “But be careful. Want doesn’t stop where your feet end.”

He set his jars on a flat place and slid the hatchet back onto its tie. He dipped his hand into the creek and scooped up a bit of want. He packed it like a snowball. It was warm. He knew how to make it point. He whispered a word to it—compass—and it twitched toward where it wanted to go. It wanted to go into the shape of that hooked line and twist. He did not oblige it. He made it want a bit more. Then he stepped back and let it spin—always to the same direction, eastward along the creek, toward the place where the water widened and dipped under the back lot of the tire shop, where somebody had thrown out their old rubber and it was a bad chew for beaver.

He followed with careful feet.

“Do you do nothing quietly?” Junebug said in a voice at his elbow that made him nearly drop his heart. She had done one of her slips: the way she could become background, become shadow, become wallpaper pattern, then pop out of it like laughter.

“You stepped like a cat with new legs,” Imri said when he could say anything at all.

“That’s unkind. About cats. I came because Master Oakes tapped his finger on his legal pad three times to tell me that he had forgotten how to see in strange places. Are we seeing in a strange place now? Excellent. Is that a wantball? Can I lick it?”

“No. No licking it. It will take your tongue somewhere you don’t intend to go.” He turned the wantball with his fingers so she could see it tug. “He marked the bridge. He’s making the Thread think it is home. It feels lazy, but it’s more like—like persuasion with broken brakes. I’m looking for more marks.”

Junebug stared at him. “You know that sometimes, Imri, I remember that you do magic like other people breathe, and I have to sit down or climb something. I’ll climb something, because we are already wet. Give me a minute.” She scuttled up a rafter of root and perched, a disreputable bird. “Squid wanted to come. I told him that this part of the night smells like secrets that don’t want to keep him. He took it well.”

“Squid is wise,” Imri said. He sighed. “Kinna looked at me like I walked around her today and left a draft.”

“She did not,” Junebug said, but her voice softened. “She looked at you like you are a map with a route through a neighborhood she thought she knew.”

He tasted the want again. It pushed at his fingers for east. He netted it with one of his jar-lids and shoved it onto his belt, so it sat there: a small, warm impatience. Under the back lot of the tire shop, the creek narrowed and ran low and brown. The air was heavy with rubber ghosts and oil. Glass grit winked in places where bottles had ended badly. A fat goose with resentment issues hissed at them and got on with being a goose. Imri paused where the bank slumped and the creek rippled over a knee of rock. There, under the lip of shadow, was another mark, faint, a smaller one. He traced it with his finger, not touching it. The wantball strained on his belt, but he held it still.

He felt Vireo approach before he saw him. That was part of Vireo’s magic, too. Not the loud swagger. The way he made the air behave differently: like champagne someone had shaken. He stepped out from behind a machine that could cut tires into pretty bands, as if he had been cut into a pretty band and had no idea.

“You’re very busy,” he said, as if complimenting a tree on the leaves it had troubled to grow.

“You’re very casual,” Imri said, crouched. “For someone who’s marking a town as if it was a map and you were the only person who could read it.”

“I can read it,” Vireo said lightly. “More, I can improve it. Someone has to. You all have been in love with your own little comforts too long. You keep your jars and your polite spells. You name the rain by its kinder qualities and wonder why the storms take offense. The Thread needed a firm hand. I have fingers. See our compatibility.”

Imri stood and brushed grit from his knees. “You can’t graft your name to every stone in Mooresville. That’s not improvement. That’s invasion.”

Vireo smiled, and the smile didn’t reach the places he might keep for kindness, if he had any. “It helps if you imagine me as a god. Small g, lowercase, decidedly local. Sprites are about service, are they not? Then let the Thread serve. Let it be tended by something better than superstition and jars. I will make it elegant.”

“You talk to it like it’s a mirror,” Imri said, looking past him to the mark. “You show it a beautiful face and tell it to aspire. What happens when it can’t be you and it gets tired of trying? Who picks it up off the floor? You? You’ll be elsewhere, cutting yourself into pragmatic sizes for the next town fool enough to let you call it yours.”

“You are melodramatic,” Vireo said, as if it were a diagnosis, as if he were prescribing more sunlight and fewer drafts.

Junebug’s voice from the root-rafter: “He’s dramatic enough for the both of you. That’s the economy of art.”

Vireo did not even flinch at being surprised by her; which probably meant he had known she was there and had chosen to look unsurprised. He was very good at choosing the way he looked. He raised his chin toward the mark. “You could stop me. Cut away my notes. You are nimble enough. But then you would make enemies of the things I have promised. They will put their mouths on your hands. They will not let go. Perhaps you will make a small disaster in your effort to prevent me from making a grand success.”

“I’ll take small disasters,” Imri said. “They come with smaller graveyards.”

They stared at each other. The creek made its old conversation, always about the time it had to leave and how it meant to do it gracefully. The tire shop hummed. Smell of rubber got under Imri’s skin and made his bones itch.

“Come watch me at the school tomorrow evening,” Vireo said suddenly, the shift in topic sharp as a skyline. “They’re putting up new lights over the softball fields. I’ll make them sing. I’ll thread the Thread into the bulbs and the girls will hit balls that can’t fall. I’ll give them two innings where every ball is a bright return to the glove. No errors. They’ll remember me in their shoulders when they throw. I’m a generous man. I give spectacle.”

“Spectacle is a kind of theft,” Imri said.

“Only when you cannot do it yourself,” Vireo said. “Goodnight, Imri of Mooresville. Sleep with your jars. Try not to knock them over when you dream.”

He left as if he had invented the word. The wantball sat warm at Imri’s hip. Junebug climbed down and placed an elbow in his side. “I don’t like him,” she said. “I know that’s small of me. It sounds small to me. But it sits large in my throat. I don’t like him the way I don’t like the feeling when a shoe steps on the edge of a fallen leaf and the leaf makes that dry cry.”

“I don’t like him either,” Imri said. “Liking is not the work. Stopping him is.”

“Do you think you will?” Junebug said. She made a face. “Not will you stop him. Will you stop in time.”

“I don’t know yet,” Imri said honestly. “His marks are little fishhooks. He pulls at things that want to be pulled. That’s harder to argue with than a hammer.”

Junebug licked her thumb thoughtfully, then thought better of it and wiped it on her dress. “Let’s go not sleep and pretend we did. In the morning you can put on your training face and go to Master Oakes. He’ll tell you something heavy to carry. You like carrying heavy things. You think it makes you taller.”

“It does,” Imri said mildly, and gathered up the jars, and the want, and the pieces of himself he sometimes forgot to carry, which were heavier than the rest.

Morning in Mooresville belonged to crows and the smell of sugar from somewhere it didn’t belong. Someone was baking although it was too hot to bake; someone always did—somebody’s grandmother with stubborn elbows and a ceiling fan with moods. The streetlights he had siphoned grew drowsy and gave themselves back to the day. Imri stopped at the second-hand shop where Kinna liked to take her tea because the cups had already remembered hands. He bought nothing. He would have carried those cups for her if she had asked. Kinna shook her head and told him to sit and not to fidget, so he compromised and sat and fidgeted with his foot only.

“The Thread is more frayed than I wanted,” she said. “I felt…hungry, last night. I wondered if it was mine.”

“It wasn’t,” Imri said. “He’s making it want him.”

Kinna’s eyes had grown old watching the way the sun moved through rooms. “There are stories about sprites who did such things. They don’t end with weddings and only a couple of dramatic funerals. They end with towns without shadows. They end with towns that cannot remember rain. They end with the wind asking a different kind of question than we have answers for.”

“I could cut his marks,” Imri said, careful, all the words wrapped in cloth. “But every cut will make the Thread feel the pain that goes with it. He knew that when he scratched it in. It’s not just a note. It’s a thorn that sits under skin. You pull it, the skin swells. The body wants to push the thorn out on its own time. He’s counting on our patience.”

“Arrogance does not wait well,” Kinna said. “He will show more today. His need to be adored will make him noisy. You can use that.”

Junebug, who had found half a sugar packet which she should not have been given, poured a white cascade into her hand, seasoned it with air, and licked it like salt. She said, when she could breathe again, “If he’s bending things at the softball field, we should bring mothers. Mothers have magic that burns if you aim it simple. I saw a woman at a T-ball game once threaten weather. The cloud got out of her way.”

“We should be careful with mothers,” Master Oakes sighed. “They were almost tricked into burnings once, and they remember it in their knuckles.”

“I could speak to the girls,” Imri said. “I could say that they are already bright, and their arms do not belong to a man who paints his wings. I could say that I am here only for the air’s behalf and want nothing of their hitting.”

Master Oakes smiled into his tea. “You could say that. They would hear a whisper in their spines and never know why they stood with their shoulders set and did not falter. Yes. You could say that.”

Imri finished his tea. He knew he was already late for nothing in particular and the lateness irritated him. He didn't carry patience like a perfect coin. He carried it like a pebble you sometimes forget in your pocket and then find, and it has worn the shape of your thumb.

The softball field was new metal and bright chalk lines and a fence that had not yet learned the peculiar rust that comes from nights of kids and evenings of fathers who swear they will mend things and do not always. The girls were young and old at once. They had braids and the kind of gaze that can flatten any spectator. Several parents had the portable shade contraptions that made their chairs seem like thrones. Old soda cans rolled underfoot. The new lights rose tall as man-made dawn.

Vireo was already there. Of course he was. He had his mirror pressed against his chest. He had collected the little attentions that always collect around a person who behaves as if they expect attention. They were a cloud around him—conversation, curiosity, the scent of someone’s perfume that kept insisting on remembering homecoming dances from a different state. He bowed to the lights, then to the girls, then to the mothers.

Imri said nothing. He walked behind the bleachers, brushing his fingers along the fence. In the metal he felt many lessons about stubbornness. He told those lessons they were loved. He told the fence it could quiver without breaking. He told the chalk lines to be chalk, nothing more. He told the girls something he had thought about all morning: that the weight of their own arms was a country not anyone else had naming rights to. He told them more—small things, almost not words. He said: you are not a stage. He said: the field is as much yours as the look in your eyes. His words were like dust motes in sunlight: almost invisible even to those who breathed them. When he stopped speaking, he felt their spines set. He felt small, unremarkable bravery gather itself like hair that decides to curl because it is humid out.

Vireo clapped. The sound rang. “Ladies,” he said, and the girls understood that he meant it as an announcement of himself. “What if now and then your arms could forget tiredness? What if the ball went—” he made a soft, persuasive noise “—like that?”

The coach, a woman whose hair had learned to outlast summers, looked dubious. She looked at him as if he were a new variety of fundraiser she had to endure no matter how it cost her. “We’re here to practice, not to get a show.”

“I would argue,” Vireo said solemnly, though his mouth was laughing, “that practice without spectacle is a lie you tell yourself to avoid the truth that you are already performing. But I can be small. I can be barely there. How about one inning, and if I make it worse, you may throw me into the lost and found with the water bottles without names.”

The girls tittered because his words were odd and tittering was one way of dealing with that. The mothers stiffened. Imri breathed and then breathed again. He said, under his breath, to the lamps, to the chalk, to the fence: you are not a stage either. Remember your own making.

The inning began. Vireo lifted his hands and the lights hum-hummed like a hive testing a storm. The first pitch arrived like a promise. The hit was clean and bright. The ball did something it had no business doing: curved back toward the glove in a way that made the catcher giggle because she couldn’t help it. The second was a grounder that did not kick up a single pebble. The third went out to left, but left had been waiting for it with a calm that sounded like Vireo’s word in her muscles. Everything was smooth, and that felt wrong. The field was a series of flaws. The field deserved the holiness of error, the way a bad bounce can teach you humility more quickly than any sermon. Vireo’s inning was scaled to the size of his ego. And oh, did the girls grin. They felt good. It was a compelling expression. Imri understood that the body is a greedy thing and wants to do well, and of course—it’s not a sin to want grace.

He slid under the bleachers and laid his palm against the central pole. He spoke to the lights more insistently. He said: you are not an altar. If a man uses you as a pedestal, you may grow hot and burn his hair sights. He told the chalk it was allowed to smudge. He told cleats to remember gravel. He spoke to the girls again and he told them a story about the day they first learned to throw properly: the way the ground had felt, the way the coach’s hands had adjusted their elbows, the way somebody’s laughter had sounded like a campfire. He told every muscle that responded to a man’s voice that it could also respond to its own, and the word it might say was no.

Vireo’s inning began to falter. One ball skittered. A glove snapped late. A mother leaned forward with her jaw set in what could have been suspicion or blessing. Vireo held his hands out, but the lights did not hum for him. He bared his teeth at the lamps, which was a ridiculous act. The lamps were much taller than him, and even if they had known what teeth were, they were indifferent to most threats. Imri whispered to the girls that they could keep their skills and leave Vireo’s spell out on the field like a jacket they realized they did not want.

The inning ended. It was good. It was not perfect. The girls glowed because work makes a light that stays even when you sleep. The coach did not throw Vireo into the lost and found, but she gave him a towel she had meant to save. “Thank you,” she said, and made it sound like something she had chosen to say rather than had been charmed into.

Vireo stood very still. He was good at the not-moving of a person who wants to control more than his expression. He said, “This town, for all its half-truths and reverent grip on its own reflected self—this town—is going to be an education.” He looked over to the place under the bleachers where Imri had stood, but Imri was not there. He had melted into the crowd’s periphery. It's a skill: to be seen only by the things you ask to look.

Junebug sat on the pole nearest the concession stand, legs swinging, blowing a straw wrapper at Squid. “I think,” she said to Imri later, under the pines, “that you embarrassed him. Not publicly. Publicly is the only thing he understands. But you embarrassed him somewhere private. Somewhere between where his breath ends and his explanation begins.”

“He embarrassed himself,” Imri said. “I only told the lights they were lights and the girls they were girls.”

“Which is, you understand, witchcraft,” Junebug said.

He walked to the creek again that evening. There were new marks. One on the rail at the park where the fathers did their best not to talk about their jobs; one small one under the lip of the old fountain that stopped working during the trial of 1978 and never started again. All of them the same line with a hook; all of them lightly scratched in such a way that when a child traced the place absentmindedly, their hand would remember to believe in a face that wanted their attention.

He carried with him a small bag filled with thistle down, a spool of red thread, a stone he had borrowed from the bottom of a human’s pocket without being asked. He scraped chalk into a sliver, whispered to it, made it remember being limestone, then made it remember being backbone, then made it forget both. He undid three of Vireo’s hooks and the Thread kicked in annoyance. It bit his finger. He hissed and let it. He told it a joke his grandmother had told him, the one about a fox that thought it was a scarecrow and kept frightening itself until it fell deeply in love with its own reflection and drowned in a puddle. The Thread calmed.

“You’re unpicking my embroidery,” Vireo said from the park bench. He looked weary and sparkling; he had been admired somewhere and it had kept him alive. “Do you know how long this takes? Do you understand what I’m building?”

“Something that will collapse under its own mirrors,” Imri said without looking up. He could imagine Vireo’s mouth tightening; it was not an unpleasant image. “Your scaffolding is applause.”

“And yours is refusal,” Vireo said. “You love ‘no’ the way some people love their children. You should be careful. You will make a reputation. They will call you the boy who said no to the day.”

“I say no to you,” Imri said simply. He tied the red thread into the notch of the mark and tugged it out. It squealed; it would not squeal long. He tucked the thistle down into the place where the mark had lived, to catch any return. He made a small sound with his teeth that told the Thread that it was boring to be addicted to one man’s attention, no matter how much he painted his wings.

Vireo leaned forward, elbows on knees. His voice softened—it could do that, unexpectedly, which was a reminder not to underestimate him. “Imri. Did no one teach you to appoint yourself to small dominions. To say: This creek is mine. These lights are mine. These girls are mine, and they thrive because I hold them like this. That’s all I’m doing. I’m saying: it’s mine. The whole world feels better when someone finally takes it in hand and tells it what to do. You remember that, don’t you? A human hand putting something exactly where your mother said not to put it, and the world did not end. It felt tidy.”

Imri felt his jaw. He made it relax. “I have hands. I have jars. I have a creek that likes to be contrary, and lights that hum to somebody’s teenage heart when nobody is listening. I have the girls’ shoulders, which have decided to learn to throw and to keep learning after they forget who taught them. And I have a town that doesn’t want a god. You are not going to have them.”

Vireo watched him for a long moment. He nodded once, as if conceding a point in a game that did not have points. “There are other ways to win. You have not lived in enough corners to know them yet.” He stood. He looked down on the bench and decided it was beneath him, which it was always going to be. “Tomorrow night, there is a party at the dealership. Balloons. Hot dogs. They will light the big inflatable thing that looks like a car that ate another car. I will tie a Thread to it that no one will ever cut. Be there. Or catch up when you can.”

He left. Imri sat on the bench and looked at the bite on his finger where the Thread had objected. It had left a small indentation, like a memory of an argument. He felt the ache in his hand and turned it into a small laugh because he could. Junebug climbed into his lap without ceremony and he did not push her off because she had earned all the unearned permissions. She rested her head against his chest and listened to his heart like a child who collects birdsong.

“I think he underestimates how stubborn we are,” she said, without opening her eyes.

“Yes,” Imri said. “We are very stubborn.”

“You are,” she said. “I am merely spectacular.”

He wanted to sleep, but sleep would come as a stranger. He walked instead. Night turned Mooresville into something he loved more than was fair. The heat had let go a little. The sidewalks forgave scuffed toes. He cut three more of Vireo’s marks and left their echoes stuffed with soft things. He found a child’s chalk drawing on a driveway, a house with a chimney as big as the house. He told the drawing to be strong in the morning when the sun tried to fade it, because children’s art had to learn to grow back. He watched a cat sit in a window and try to hypnotize him into feeling humble. He was humble. He admitted it and moved on.

At the dealership, the inflatable car had eaten the front lawn and was digesting it with pleased noises. Lights in the strings above it glimmered as if they were trying on their own reflections. Vireo stood near the grill with the hot dogs, smiling benevolently upon meat. He wore a new mirror, larger, which meant he had found someone who wanted to have one fewer mirror. The manager had a handshake like municipal water; Imri avoided it easily. He drifted near the strings of lights and listened to the small arguments they had with their sockets. He told them to argue more. He told them to insist on being unspectacular.

Vireo raised his hands and a cheer rose that had nothing to do with him and everything to do with a raffle. He accepted it anyway and bent it toward himself. He wrapped the Thread around the inflatable car and tied it with a flourish. The car rose half an inch, as if flattered. The lights sang a song and then forgot to continue. The Thread wavered, and then decided.

Imri touched the mark Vireo had left under the grill. He saw the hooked line, the twist. He pressed his finger to it and felt it yelling in a spectrum no one else could hear. He peeled it back as if it were a scab. Again the Thread bit him. This time he bit back: not at the Thread, but at the mark. He bent the little hook in half. He fed it its own shape. It choked on itself, and went softer. He spit on it, which was not polite magic, but sometimes the thing that makes you human is the thing that undoes someone’s arrogance.

Vireo looked over at him. He had felt it. He saw what Imri was doing and something flashed across his face that was not a smile, not a threat. It was almost surprise that the boy with jars had teeth. He lifted his chin. He tossed his head. He started to speak to the lamps, and Imri spoke first.

“Look,” he said to the crowd. He had never wanted to talk to a crowd. He had feared it more than he feared forgetting a spell. “Look at the car. It is only a car. It is large. It is ridiculous. You are allowed to laugh. Look at the lights. Think of all the moths you have known, all the summers when you were not a parent or a mark on a payroll, all the times you licked mustard off your knuckles without being told not to. You are allowed to be here without being a part of a demonstration. You can just eat your hot dog. You can just wipe your face on your sleeve. You can just be.”

They laughed, because permission is funny when it is obvious. They laughed and the laugh nudged Vireo’s spell in the ribs. It is hard to hold a spell in a rigid position when a hundred people decide simultaneously not to be impressed. The inflatable car burped. The lights blinked like ordinary lights on an ordinary Thursday evening. The Thread, cheated of its planned adoration, sagged back into place as if it had remembered laundry.

Vireo did not bow. He did not snarl. He stayed still, which was almost the same thing as moving away. He let the evening be mediocre. He let someone else win a pressure washer. He watched Imri with a thread of attention, a real one, not a spelled one. He smiled a small true smile, the first true thing in him that Imri had seen.

“You are better than your jars,” he said later, as they walked away in different directions but encountered each other, because towns are like that. “I like that. I am bored by so many things, and now I am less bored.”

“You could try doing nothing,” Imri said. “That is rarely boring. It is much harder to be still than to be noisy.”

“Stillness is for people who want to hear their own hearts,” Vireo said, and made it sound like an accusation. “Mine is loud enough already.”

“You might be surprised,” Imri said.

He slept that night like a light between storms. His dreams smelled like oil and river grass. When he woke, Kinna had left a small piece of paper on his windowsill that said, in a slow hand, The Thread chose you. He breathed around the words until he could do something besides panic. Then he went to the creek, to the bridge, with his jars on his belt and the thistle down and the red thread and the stone from the human pocket and a laugh he had not earned yet but meant to learn.

The Thread met him halfway. It leaned toward him, willing to find the shape that fit. “You are not my reflection,” he told it, kneeling. “You are the water’s shadow and the bridge’s memory and the place where footsteps become lighter when they leave, because people always step like that when they are in love. You are not a boy. You are a slice of the town’s faithfulness. That’s all you have to be. That is a lot.”

He sang to it. He made his jars hum low. He said the words copper, bees, grandmother, but he said them in a new order, because order matters, and because he did not want to be his own habit. The Thread settled into a curve that did not show off. It met the bend in the creek and made a sound like a cat who is pleased for reasons a cat would never bother to articulate. He let the wantball dissolve. It had led him where it could and had been honest about its limits. He let the bite on his finger bleed a little onto the concrete, because a promise with a drop of blood never forgets itself.

The morning brightened. The trains wandered. He could feel Vireo at the edge of town, scratching another mark, deciding not to, scratching it anyway. He could feel the parents at the softball field packing away chairs and humming without knowing it. He could feel Junebug curled in some place where sunlight made a window into honey. He could feel Kinna, writing with her slow hand, making their parliament into a list of stubborn reminders.

He put his palm on the bridge and whispered, “I am here.” The Thread bent to him like grass. And then it straightened again, set in the just place between being wanted and wanting. He smiled and let his hair do what it wanted and lifted into the day because flying was still the most ancient way to say: I will not be told where to stand.By noon the town had decided it was August whether or not the calendar agreed, and the air showed its stubbornness by standing still and asking to be forgiven. Imri walked the spine of the bridge with his jars tucked close and the note from Kinna folded under his belt, and every time a car crossed he lifted himself barely enough to let the shiver pass through his shoes instead of his ribs. He had slept like damp paper, but the Thread felt steadier beneath his hand, its pulse no longer eager in the way of a dog that has just learned the word walk. It was not tame; it was set, and there was more relief in that than in a dozen compliments. He leaned over to talk to the water in the voice he saved for cousins and cats that tolerated him, and it forgave him for all the jars he had asked it to sing into. A train moaned toward town and the lights along Broad flicked their filaments in agreement with nothing in particular, and the sound wrapped the braces of the bridge until the bolts murmured stories about the first day they were driven home.

When he reached the attic, the Parliament had already done the old counting that wasn’t counting, and there was a thin shell of ceremony drying over the work table where Master Oakes kept the oddities that needed not to be quite normal or quite holy. The elders stood the way old trees stand when wind arrives with a thesis, and the twins Pash and Pash were playing a hand game with themselves that would have been called cheating if anyone else had tried it. Kinna’s braid had been tied with the paper band from a bouquet, and it was crisp in a way that made Imri snap his own belt back into place. The air carried a curl of cinnamon because someone downstairs had burned it pretending it was fall, and everyone upstairs forgave the attempt.

“We did the choosing last night,” Kinna said, while Junebug slid down a plaster seam like a pastry pearl escaping frosting. “The Thread leaned, and it did not lean toward a blue wing. It leaned toward a boy who tells the difference between a promise and a performance. It is yours to tend by agreement as well as habit.” She lifted a tool from the table and the room breathed a little differently when the metal cleared the wood. It was a nail the size of a human little finger and three times as honest, forged when the tracks had needed a reminder that they were straight. Its head bore two dings that were not ornamental. On its shaft there was no rust, only a thin whisper of old trains.

Imri’s hand warmed from the wrist down when she set the nail on his palm. It had weight that was not only weight and a quiet that was not only silence, and he let his fingers curl around it because anything else would have been disrespectful. He thought of the times he had looked for something heavy to carry because it made everything else seem possible. He thought of the creek singing as if it were being fed lies and liking them. He thought of Vireo’s face when his spell had been laughed past by a crowd interested in mustard. “Thank you,” he said, though the words were small and knocked around inside the room looking for hooks. “I’ll use it where nails belong.”

“You’ll use it where nails refuse to be,” Master Oakes added, smiling as if he were letting Imri in on an old joke. “And you’ll ask it to be kind to wood that didn’t ask to be nailed. There’s more to it than hammering. It is a key for places that forget themselves flat. It means the bridges know your name. Try not to drop it in the river.”

Junebug pressed a violet petal into the curve of Imri’s ear like a letter seal and then thought better of her own sentimentality and tugged it out before anyone could name it as such. “Squid wanted to be here but his mother had the sort of appointment that everyone calls serious because no one knows what it is, and he has to carry her purse like a badge. He told me to tell you he sharpened all his pencils in case there is an emergency that wants to be corrected. What are we doing first, besides eating something improbable and calling it breakfast?”

“We’ll go to the water tower,” Kinna said, and she did not look at anyone when she said it, which is always a sign that something has decided it will be hard. “They’re repainting it. New logo, new spirit, new sense of itself. Vireo is the kind of boy who loves a white surface. He will make it do the work he likes. He will tell it its new paint is the end of its old duties. He will hang a mark high where he expects we won’t bother to climb.” She lifted her eyes then and they were not soft, though her voice was. “We have ladders. We have friends who are good with ladders.”

The water tower had always been taller than its own idea of tall, and the painters’ scaffolding made it look like a mother wearing earrings because she had promised her child she would try being fancy. The crew had taken lunch in the shade shaped like a pick-up that wondered when it would get to rest. A boy in a bright T-shirt had been allowed to throw his orange peels toward a trash can and was missing on purpose because missing held the same thrill neatness never could. The tower’s old lettering, the sort that had been hand-brushed by someone with a sandwich balanced on their knee, had been scrubbed into a pale ghost. New letters, big as new money, arced bold and professional. Vireo’s idea of a mirror.

He was already there, lounging in the suspicion of shadow under the tower’s belly as if he had commanded it to consider shade a courtesy. He had welded his smile to the scaffolding with a confidence that made the metal not creak. He waved when he saw them, the kind of wave that pretends not to signal strength and therefore signals it more. His hair had been caught up in wire that had known shirts. The mirror on his chest had grown a rim of beads the blue of swimming pools that only exist in magazines.

“You brought your congregation,” he said, as if that was generosity on Imri’s part. “How clerical. How civic. I was worried you’d get shy. That’s a poor defense, shyness. It makes very little armor and attracts small persistent insects.”

“I brought a nail,” Imri said. “It bites.”

Vireo laughed because the sound of laughter could do the work of making other sounds feel inferior. “Do you intend to climb with it? Will you pry my mark out of the sky like a loose tooth?”

Imri looked up. The rim of the tower traced tropic against the too-blue, and there, just under the lip, he saw it. The line with a hook, cut not into paint but into the stubborn steel where paint did not count. His hand twinged at the place the Thread had bitten him. The mark thrummed in a frequency that made his jar rattles murmur white-noise approval, as if they recognized the stubbornness of the steel and mistook it for family. “You cut it high,” he said. “You wanted us to despair.”

“I wanted you to accept that there are things above you,” Vireo said, and his gaze lifted with his chin so his throat’s angle told the story of superiority. “So often you work in low places. Gutters. Under-bridge seams. Lamps, which are only tall when you refuse to do math. It is time you learn the lesson of altitude.”

Junebug made the sound ants make when presented with a hill they intend to demolish because it offended an aunt. “He wants a crane,” she said sweetly. “Or an audience that doesn’t understand ladders. He’s betting on gravity because he thinks it is a friend that cooks for him.”

“Is gravity not an excellent chef?” Vireo inquired, but there was an edge of impatience under his charm, a wire showing where the bunting did not cover.

Imri stepped to the scaffolding and set his hand to an upright where someone had written their name in pencil because the wet paint had been too far above their ambition. The metal had a heartbeat, if you were willing to believe in such things, and he told it he did. It steadied. He took his jars, placed them into Junebug’s greedy arms, and loosened the nail from his belt. He slid under the first rung and balanced above the second. He climbed, not like someone trying to make the climb look like a story, but like someone who had climbed trees and front porches and regret. He did not look down as a performance; he looked down because he liked to know where he had been.

From the platform halfway up, the town looked like a map made by a child with too many crayons and a sensible grandmother. The creek showed its back in two places like a slipping ribbon. The dealership’s inflatable was collapsed and resembled a myth that had not come true. The softball field wore the faintest bruise down the first-base line because a girl had slid and learned something about skin. Imri rested one knee, breathed, and went on. The mark loomed as he approached, its shallow cut gleaming like a quiet betrayal. It hummed through the steel and into the skin of his shins.

He could not cut it without courting the groan of the whole tower, and the tower was not his to make groan. He could not scrape it with his nail and not risk painting the sound onto the air in a color that would draw every buzzy thing for three miles. He could, however, tap. He could tell the nail to be a tongue. He could set it gently against the metal and knock out a rhythm that said: no vacancy, wrong door, come back when you have a better, smaller ask. He angled the head against the mark and tapped once, twice, three times, then three and bone and glass, then the speech of broomgrass and copper, then his grandmother’s syllables that made the nail hum like a bell between prayers.

The mark answered not with a retreat but with a shudder, and that was admission enough. He tapped again and this time he pressed the nail’s shaft against the hooked curve, pushing not to gouge but to smooth, to persuade metal that it had always wanted to be a little less proud. The hook softened like a word misremembered. He reached into his pocket, found the red thread, and tied it around the head of the nail, then pushed the thread into the shallow cut until it filled the place where the hook had wanted to pull. Thread met thread in a way that made both of them close their eyes. The steel accepted a whisper of softness. The mark stopped humming and began sulking instead.

Below, Vireo had moved so he stood where he would be in frame if someone had thought to take a picture. His face was polite, but his hands betrayed a readiness to do something regrettable. Master Oakes murmured to the scaffolding a phrase from a book where he had once gotten lost; the scaffolding dug its feet into the ground as if it were a tree after all. Junebug placed Imri’s jars around her in a circle and told them they were her committee and they would vote with their best fizz only.

Imri felt the tower’s attention wander the way attention does when a charm takes longer than its composer promised. He tapped the nail’s head one last time and said a word that belonged to no one. It fell from his mouth like a bead of glass and landed where the hook had been. The mark gave up the ghost of its tug and sat, inert, a bad idea that had been told a better one by five hands in a row. He leaned his forehead against the steel in thanks that the steel did not require more apology than he could give, and then he climbed back down with his thighs burning and his breath making a music he could pretend was planned.

“What a long way to go to say maybe,” Vireo said, but there was no triumph in it and no lesson either. He had expected a fight made of spark and spectacle. He was very bad at thinking small defeats mattered.

“It was a good maybe,” Junebug said. “My jars agreed. They fizzed at the precise politically opportune times.”

Kinna nodded to Imri without taking the time to dress the motion as ceremony. “There will be more. He is marking the town the way a desperate man kisses people he only just met. The water tower will forget him because it is old enough to keep promises to paint and gravity, and you told it it was allowed to grow bored. The places that are not old will need more work. He will scratch his hooks where things are brittle. Old promises bend. New ones break.”

Imri wiped his hands on the cloth he kept for that purpose and then swept the cloth over his hair because his hair liked such attention even if it would not be tamed by it. “Squid,” he said, surprising himself with his own subject change, “has pencils. He sharpens them when he is sure there will be trouble. Master Oakes, is there anything here pencils can do that nails and jars cannot?”

Master Oakes blew a strand of broomgrass beard away from his lip with a sigh that sounded like a fan moving through a afternoon that had not yet decided to storm. “People think magic is a monopoly. It is not. It is a franchise, badly regulated. Humans have always written over our nonsense with their own, and sometimes we were improved by it. Your hooked boy is littering the margins of Mooresville with wrong grammar. The sign downstairs has been taking offense for years and has not forgiven any of us. If Squid were to bring a red pencil to the marks his human hands could reach and make the proper correction, we might see his ink make the steel feel foolish. Embarrassment is a glue. Once it dries it either holds or tears skin.”

Junebug crowed a little because the idea of a boy with a pencil walking into the kind of story usually reserved for nails and moth-wings pleased her like a piece of candy that somehow also varnished your nails. “And we can go with him,” she said. “We can be in his periphery like a scarf he forgot he was wearing. We can tell him when to use a semicolon, by which I mean we can show him where to stop, and where to breathe and go on.”

Vireo tilted a hand as if he were considering educating an audience that had already done its homework. “Recruit children. Frighten mothers. Invite grammar to do violence to sigils. How very local. How narrow. How unpleasantly effective such things tend to be.” He looked at Imri with something like irritation and something like respect scribbled along the same line. “You are going to be busy. Are you sure your jars can stand the attention?”

“My jars are used to paying attention while I am doing silly things,” Imri said. “They will survive this with better manners than you.”

He expected Vireo to step sideways into cruelty, the way a dancer steps from one square to another on a floor they have decided belongs to them. He did not expect the swerve into quiet. “Do you think I don’t know how to mend,” Vireo said, the word tasting new in his mouth, not because he had not spoken it but because he did not often dig at it with care. “Do you imagine I came to your drowsy town with only one trick and a pair of painted wings? I know the way a Thread ought to lie. I know the angle a bridge prefers when it wants to hide the fear of its thinnest leg. I am not only a thief. It is just that people rarely thank you when you mend. They thank you when you dazzle.” He smiled, but it had so little of his earlier light in it that it looked like a neighbor borrowing a face. “You are mending. You will be thanked so little that your bones will wonder why they bother to keep dust.”

Imri almost said the thing that would have sounded kind and been crueler than anything he had told a Thread. He almost said: who didn’t thank you, back where you learned to care about the angle of bridges. He almost asked if a town had spit him out of itself like a seed with a bitter skin. He almost asked if he had stood by a river and watched it run out of him the way light runs out of a bulb that has been asked to shine too long. He did not ask those things, because he had promised himself somewhere between the water tower and the attic that his mouth would not become a place that sharpened itself on other people’s loneliness. He said instead, “Mending is its own applause. You don’t have to hear it to know it’s clapping.”

Vireo’s laugh this time did not try to seduce anyone. It burst like a bird startled out of a bush where it had believed itself invisible. “If that keeps you alive, keep saying it. I will go cut three more marks, but somewhere you will not think to go, because you do not shop for mattresses.”

They watched him leave with the feeling you get when you watch a deft thief in a crowd and you both admire the hands and want to break them. Kinna put her hand on Imri’s shoulder for so brief a time he nearly did not notice. “You will need a partner for Squid,” she said. “Not Junebug. She will be there anyway. Someone who understands the virtue of thick paper. Someone who knows how to look boring men in their socks and say no with an invoice in their hands.”

They found that someone at the shop with the grammar-sign because of course they did. The owner, who had been nameless for so long that her name had become a sound you learned only when you handed her exact change, disliked balloons, liked receipts with the deep satisfaction of a person who realized their own order kept something safe, and had a pencil behind her ear that had not moved since Carter. She looked at Imri the way someone looks at the corner of the room where a cat has chosen not to be noticed. He explained about hooks and threads and the way a boy with a mirror could bully a tower. She did not ask for proof because proof often arrives like a door-to-door salesman. She simply gathered three red pencils from the little glass by the register and put them in a small paper bag along with a copy of the returns policy.

“You mess with a sign,” she said, as if addressing no one on purpose. “You learn what a sign does when you try to mess with it. The world is a long sentence. We live inside the clauses we can buy. If your boy writes, I will collect.”

Squid joined them in a shirt that declared he had survived an event that had only ever taken courage of the ordinary sort, and he held himself upright the way a person does when they believe a small uprightness might prevent everything from tipping. He had a red pencil tucked behind each ear and one in his mouth like a cigarette from an old movie that would have been improved by fewer men talking. He had drawn a mark like Vireo’s on page after page in his notebook to learn where its weak places were, and had ended with a series of hooks that looked weary and ill-tempered and one that had been overcorrected into an ampersand.

“I can do corrections,” he said. “I do them when my teacher writes ‘your’ in a way that implies she is on a boat and not paying attention. Will these marks be mad at me.”

“They might be embarrassed,” Imri said, and the way he said it made Squid’s eyes do that thing like someone had turned on a light behind them. “We will be near, but you might not see us the whole time. That will make us better luck.”

They went to the mattress store because Vireo had done them a kindness by telling them where he would wound most easily. The place smelled like new plastic and the exact average of ten arguments a day. Men in polo shirts lay down to pretend to be asleep while their wives looked at price tags the way one looks at a weather report. Children stood on the trampolines in the back where there were no trampolines, only lies told by the floor. Along the baseboard a mark had been scratched in under the glee of a display of throw pillows that did not want to be thrown. Imri pointed, then stepped back as if stepping back meant something other than letting a human do a human job.

Squid knelt. He took out a red pencil and held it like a wand someone had had the sense to label thrifty. He drew a line across the hook, not to slash it, but to tell it it had misused its verb. He added a caret and above it wrote home in letters that had learned to be both fat and shy. He circled the twist and drew an arrow to the margin where he wrote in small neat hand: you don’t live here. He underlined with four staccato taps because he had once watched a coach do that and loved the percussion. The mark recoiled as much as a scratch can recoil. It sank. It tried to argue about the meaning of prepositions. Squid wrote NO in a way that made the O into a certain, unforgiving circle. The hook apologized in the only way it knew, which was to stop tugging itself toward anything. The pillow display sighed as if it had gotten to throw something after all and had liked it.

They made corrections up and down Broad, under the lip of the fountain that had not worked since the trial that everyone called interesting but did not talk about at dinner, on the metal leg of a bench that had not forgiven Gum Day, under the frame of a billboard that had once sold villas to people who had never bought stoves. Each time Squid wrote the same notes and then little ones, private ones: not today and eat your sandwich and you will only get the town you earn. He wrote to the marks as if they could read, which of course they could not, but the town could and the town did. The pencil marks sank into the places Vireo had scratched and those places went strangely quiet, as if the correction had not only covered the error but reminded the surface that it could be surface without being mouth.

Vireo watched them once, from across a parking lot where a human child had carved a highway into dust with a toy whose wheels did not turn. He saw Squid underline a hook so boldly the underline ruptured into laughter. He looked at Imri long enough that the look nearly set up housekeeping. Then he shook his head as if to dislodge a dog that had leapt onto his lap without permission and walked toward the edge of town where the zinnias did their heroic best against a fence with a bright new LOCKED sign which had been spelled in a font that did not deserve them.

Evenings layered themselves on top of each other and became a week. The dealership inflated and deflated things with the resigned pride of a parade balloon that knows its work is seasonal. The softball girls got better with the lack of a miracle. The churchyard’s boundary stone remembered a joke from 1902 and told it to lightening bugs who took it for a spell and went home handsome for three nights. It would have been a good week if not for the feeling that the ground was considering picking itself up and putting itself somewhere else.

That feeling came from the old substation at the edge of the creek where the power had once been made to behave by transformers that had understood dignity. The building had been caged and then ignored, which is a way towns keep dangerous things from remembering they have teeth. Vireo stood on its roof as if he had built the roof and had chosen its pitch, and the marks he had cut there were not one or two small hooks but a lattice, a net, a weaving that held its own weight not by honesty but by being impressed with itself. He had convinced something large to want him. The air around the substation had a flavor of tin and jealousy. A train rolled past and blew long and low as if telling the substation not to be ridiculous. The substation lifted its dust and disagreed.

Imri felt the hum hit his shoulder like a friend pounding on a door because they could not knock with grace anymore. He ran, and Junebug ran, and Master Oakes did his old-man hurry that always surprised people who thought his joints were merely historical. Kinna arrived with two other elders who had not gone out at night since the war that had not been listed as such in the papers. Squid came because he had decided to do what frightened him if he was allowed to take notes about it. The human shopkeeper with the pencils did not come because she had to close the register with fists like stones and could not leave a drawer in that condition, but she had sent a bag of pencils with erasers the size of movies.

The marks on the substation reached out like hands that wanted to be worshiped and like vines that had seen too many abandoned porches. They slapped at the air and it went obedient because air is faithful to almost everyone. Vireo stood in the center of his own web and he was not smiling or preening or waiting for applause. He was focused, which was worse. He was threading the town’s fear of its own power into a shape that would always want him to give it instructions. He was building a way to be necessary forever.

Imri did not wave or call or deliver a speech as if words could do all the heavy lifting when metal had been asked to sing the wrong song. He set his jars in a row on the low wall and he took the nail and he drove it between two hooked lines where the lattice had been smart enough to leave itself a small weakness. He did not so much strike as introduce, hello, here is a better angle. The lattice shivered to accommodate him. He spoke to the building in the voice he used for things that had seen themselves go out of fashion. He told it that silence was still dignity. He told it that being retired did not mean being claimed by the first bright boy who said please like a prayer. He asked Junebug for all the thistle down, and she handed him a small whorl of it that had spent a morning telling stories to spiders. He stuffed it into the smallest hook and watched as the itch of it spread along the marks until the lattice twitched like a dog whose fleas had remembered their math.

Vireo lifted his hands but did not bless anything. He snarled, not at them, but at the air for not taking his instructions. “You could have left this alone,” he said, and the rant that could have followed was cut down to its bones because he knew this was not the time for paragraphs. “You could have had a town that worked like a song until it ended.”

“We do not want songs that end,” Kinna said, and her voice made the lattice hesitate because the power in the substation remembered her face from the day a storm broke a transformer in two and she had kissed its heat like a mother who knows better. “We want humming as long as we have breath.”

Squid took his pencil and drew along the lower marks, not corrections so much as sidewalks. He drew boxes around hooks and labeled them NO OUTLET and DEAD END and PARK CLOSED FOR TURTLE NEST. The marks bristled with the insult. Rugged masculinity hates a bureaucratic sign. The lattice loosened in the places a child’s small policy made a barrier. Master Oakes drew a chalk line and spoke law in it, not human law or sprite law but the kind that water sets for itself when it decides it will not jump this bank tonight because the moon says no. The marks wilted where the chalk line drew a boundary and water said ah, good, someone is paying attention.

Vireo stepped forward across his web and the web held him because he had built it to hold him. He looked at Imri and there were a dozen sentences in his eyes, all of them ending in the kind of punctuation that expects applause. He said none of them. Instead, he asked the question Imri had almost asked him beneath the water tower. “What town told you not to come back.”

“None,” Imri said, not because he wanted to best Vireo with virtue but because it was true. “I have only ever lived here. I have only ever learned the shape of this creek.” He bent the smallest hook until it thought about being a curve that pointed inward. “Who told you not to come back.”

Vireo laughed. It was not a bird. It was a window breaking in an empty house where someone had finally told the truth. “All of them,” he said lightly, as if the number were a joke. “Or none. Or one. It makes no difference. The work of being refused is such a fine apprenticeship.”

“You could try being wanted,” Junebug said, and she was not sharp for once. She looked at him with a face that would have forgave almost anything if it had been named properly. “Not the way you think. The way a fence wants a vine. The way a poet wants somebody to roll their eyes at them across a kitchen.”

Vireo’s mouth twitched. He pulled the thread of his own attention away from the lattice he had built and even that small movement made it collapse in one corner. The building exhaled a decade of dust. The air gathered itself up and asked to go back to being mess. The mark-web still held in three strong places and those places thrummed in a way that felt like the kind of headache you get when the weather wants to change but cannot decide whether to threaten or commit.

Imri lifted the nail and he put it in Vireo’s hand. He did not make a speech about trust or the uses of heavy things or the way a key feels in a lock it did not know it wanted to love. He simply closed Vireo’s fingers around the cold and said, “Mend it. Show me you know how.”

Vireo held the nail as if it might criticize him. He looked at the lattice, at the places where his clever wound had infected an old dignity. He touched the nail’s head to the nearest hook and the mark shivered, not because it feared pain but because it recognized the hum of the trains that had threaded that nail into seriousness. He tapped once, twice. He said nothing. He did not say sorry. He bent his own hook like a boy refusing his worst habit. He undid his line with a grace that he had tried for years to develop in only one direction. The lattice let go of the air as if letting go were the only way to keep it. The building settled back into ignoring everyone.

He put the nail back in Imri’s palm as if returning an heirloom after repairing a hinge. “Do not make a fool of me by trusting me,” he said, not unkindly. “It might be catching.”

“Trust isn’t polite,” Imri said. “It isn’t a flourish. It’s just a position you take when your feet are already tired. You can stand there with me or you can not.”

Vireo looked toward the place where the town became fields and the fields became the habitual lie of the horizon. “I am going to break three more things because it is what I am built to do when I am not watched,” he said, and his truth tasted like the last sip of a soda when you have chewed all the ice and know you should have drunk water. “You will chase me and you will repair them and one day when you are dying people will say the town never had any disasters, and you will laugh in your head and forgive them for being blind. That is the contract, is it not.”

“It is one of them,” Imri said. “I want a better one, but I’ll sign this until the other arrives.”

He thought Vireo would leave then, like a scratching in a wall you never quite find. Instead Vireo sat on the lip of the low wall and let his feet dangle like a teenager who had remembered a summer evening. He watched Squid make his notes and write DONE in letters that took up as much space as he could bear to give them. He watched Kinna take her braid down and re-braid it because outcomes had been altered and her hair wanted to be told the new story. He watched Junebug stand on her hands on the transformer casing because joy is flexible. He watched Imri put the nail back on his belt like promise and weight.

By the time the sun fell stiff into the pines, the lattice had been reduced to scratches no more dangerous than the scuffs on a church pew from a thousand nervous nights. The substation went back to feeding the fences with small consistent hums and teaching children to put their tongues on them only once. They walked home along different alleys and beside different hedges and with the same tired good. The trains wandered and the lights bled their gold into the leaves until the moths came to count themselves lucky and failed at the math and were forgiven.

In his small room with its window that understood loyalty better than most windows, Imri set the nail on the sill beside Kinna’s note and lined his jars along the edge like punctuation. He sat on the floor and let his back rest against a wall that had held up three teenagers crying and one raccoon chewing and a ladder that had not been rated for bravery. He let his hair be ungovernable. He put his hand over the bite the Thread had left days ago and felt, faintly, under skin and skin again, the little hum of something that had decided not to want what it could not have. He thought of Vireo’s hands on his nail and the way the hook had gone soft. He thought of Squid’s NO, perfect and round as if it had been practice for a future he couldn’t be talked out of. He thought of the water tower and the ladder and the long cool steal and the way the town had clapped in parking lots and kitchens and bedrooms without needing sound.

Outside, the Parliament’s roof caught the black and webbed it into something less sharp. The town did its small night noises, all of them amateur and all of them true. Imri whispered to the bridge by habit. He whispered to the creek because he would not unlearn that. He whispered to his own chest, which in the right light was a sort of water tower. He told everything that would listen and things that would not, “We are here. We are not any one person’s reflection. We are boring on purpose. We are stubborn by design. We will not be a show.” And somewhere, in the place where small contracts go to fill themselves out, something signed with a flourish and a sigh and agreed to be more than a week.Morning broke like a biscuit that had been pulled apart by careful hands, soft in the middle and reluctant to admit heat. Imri took the nail off the sill because it felt rude to let a tool that had trains in its bones stare at the sun idle, and looped it back onto his belt where his jars had begun to adopt it as one of their own. He made the rounds without words bigger than his breath—past the fountain that did not work, past the thrift store that had never learned what to do with brass ducks, past the bench that forgave gum in exchange for gossip. The Second Thread hummed contentment under the bridge with the air of a thing that had discovered that not being anyone’s reflection could be a hobby. He would have been lulled by it if not for the way every corner of the morning seemed to pay too much attention to itself, the way cardboard boxes piled behind bodegas sat like thrones, the way window frames bit their glass as if to remind it who was in charge. Selfishness had a taste. Today it tasted like a square that had never enjoyed a circle and was proud of it.

Junebug found him where the bridge shadow made a cool brief country and perched on his shoulder like a feral epaulet. Her hair had decided to remember the structure of clover blossoms. She wrinkled her nose at the water and then at the stone because she always gave everyone a fair chance. “Do you feel it,” she asked, and did not wait for an answer because she wanted to be the kind of person who could tell the future by being the first to say it. “Everything baked hard around the edges. All the corners are insisting on their birth certificates. I tried to cut across the grass behind City Hall and the sidewalk made a right angle at me, which was both impolite and mathematically upsetting.”

“I felt it at the market,” Imri said, watching a square of sunlight shape itself on the concrete as if it had a right to boundaries. “A man stacked peaches like a wall and told a teenager not to round them into a pyramid, as if curves were a sacrilege. I thought Vireo for a moment, but this tastes like something else. Oakes said selfishness with corners. Maybe we were slow to look at the corners because we liked our own shelves.”

“We like our jars,” Junebug said, and she tapped one of Imri’s, making it fizz in a dignified way that suggested it was above being categorized as a mere possession. “It’s not him. It’s the boxes. It’s the place with the boxes where people put their winters. I went past the storage stretch by the bypass and could’ve sworn the padlocks were licking their teeth. The doors were humming with a song that was only choruses. It has been there a while, but today it sang louder. I dislike it the way I dislike a well-behaved lawn at midnight.”

Imri stood, jar-belt ratcheting against his hip. The storage facility had grown out by Back Creek like a field of tiny garages that had decided to be a city. He’d flown past it twice and decided to mind his own business because humans should be allowed their closets. But there are closets and there are mausoleums. There was a tone to the place now that made the hair at his nape stand up and consider unionizing. “We’ll tell Oakes,” he said, and Junebug nodded only because her hands were already thinking of what kind of thistle down would best offend a hallway that trapped air for fun.

The Attic Parliament listened with a stillness that had graduated from courtesy to practice. Master Oakes leaned on the table with the oddities until the oddities stopped pretending to be normal, and Kinna’s eyes went distant as if she were following a thread through a reed basket only she could see through. “Corners,” Master Oakes said at last, tasting the word as if it had been left out in the weather and had fermented into a truth. “It’s a habit humans got good at. They make rooms with corners so they can decide what not to see. They pack memory into boxes with corners so they can pretend time can be tidied. It’s useful until it leaks. Then it sharpens the air. It tells water how to behave without asking. Vireo is a boy who whispers mine at things until they volunteer to believe it. This is a place that says mine without a voice. We should bring broomgrass and red thread and the true nail and somebody who is not tired of looking at locks.”

“I like locks,” Junebug said, because of course she did. “They are puzzles that think they are prudent. We should also bring bubbles. Bubbles offend corners. They pop on them without apology and leave spots that make neat men reconsider.”

“Squid,” Imri said, turning to the cramped corner where a small desk had been set up between a trunk and a wall with apologies. “Do you want to see a place that will hate your pencils and maybe learn from them anyway.” Squid looked up from where he had been labeling his notebook in a system that would have made a librarian bless him with sturdy plastic sleeves. He considered the question seriously enough to make two new columns on his mental ledger and assign them three bullet points each.

“I want to,” he said after the pause had earned its respect. “I have to go home after three because it is pasta night and my mother makes dinner on pasta night even if the air yells at her. But I can come. I have extra erasers. I have a stiffer graphite too in case the paper is mean.” He patted his pockets with a kind of tenderness that made Junebug smile because she loved people who thought of supplies as brave little animals.

The storage facility existed in a world that would have preferred it not to be so proud of existing. It had a fence that announced itself with bright signs like a cheerleader getting good grades, and an office that pretended to be friendly by using a font that had been designed by a person who had never been inside a tornado. Rows upon rows of corrugated doors stretched back like a regiment. The gravel in the lanes had been made to line up and still found ways to roll into places it had not been assigned to. Imri felt the heat radiate off the metal and considered asking it to do anything politely. The air near the office licked at him in stiff little gusts that wanted to be permission slips.

The manager inside was a woman with hair that had made its peace with the head beneath it and a ledger whose columns had been inked tight enough to withstand invasion. She did not see Imri when he slipped in because she was counting cash with a focus that made the bills believe in themselves. But she looked up for a long square second at nothing, and the nothing was the Parliament gathered like pocket lint along the edges of a bulletin board. Some people have always known when there is magic in the room even if they only honor it with an extra curl at the corner of their mouth. This woman set her stapler down with the care you give a creature that might bite and said, to the empty office that was a little less empty, “There is a problem in Building C, far back. I can feel it with my teeth.” Then she went back to her columns because some people combine wariness with inventory to excellent effect.

Building C looked like the rest but sang like a choir of boxes that had memorized only the most smug hymns. The doors were a new blue that tried not to be the blue of the sky and failed, and the padlocks were all jaw: fat-bellied orange things that sat on latches like frog princes who had gone into management. The sound came off them in squares. You could have measured it. Squid knelt by the first lock and put his ear to it and then yanked it back because something in the shank had whispered mine in a way that made his skull want to be a drawer. He took out a pencil and drew a circle on the concrete around the lock’s shadow, then another, then a third, and this small act of planetary revenge soothed him like a hand on the back.

Junebug ran ahead, feet making a stitch-stitch-stitch between the doors. She pressed her palm against the corrugations at the thirteenth unit and hissed. The metal was cool the way a knife smiles. “Here,” she called, and then did not call again because calling where corners are listening is how you teach them your shape. Imri came silent and Squid followed with his tongue between his teeth and Master Oakes moved with a broom in his hand as if it were a scepter and a friend. The mark that waited on the sidewall had not been scratched with a knife. It had been pressed into the paint with a roller that had known boredom. It was perfect. It was a square inside a square inside a square with a dot at the center to force the eye to admit defeat. It did not pull like Vireo’s hook. It pushed. It told you there was no way through unless you were endorsed. It felt not like a person’s arrogance but like a policy that had eaten a person.

Imri reached for a jar and it jumped at his hand like a boy impatient to be chosen. He opened it enough to let a little static taste the air and the mark responded with a thud that was not sound so much as an insistence. The jar’s fizz snapped off. It went dark in the way fireflies go dark when they have decided you are not interesting. He blinked at it, offended on its behalf. The mark had eaten his crackle through a corner and stored it like a neat person putting ribbon in a labeled box. He snapped the lid hard so it would know he respected the loss and set the jar down near his ankle into a world where nothing could steal it without having to answer to bones.

“We need round things,” Master Oakes said, sweeping his broom gently into the corner where dust had been made to feel like evidence. “We need elbows and grandmothers and playground equipment. We need to offend this geometry with joy.”

Junebug produced, from somewhere she could not possibly have kept it, a loop of monofilament that had been strung with bottle caps hammered into tidiness and then regretted. She spun it on a small axis and the moving circle began to hum the way a coin does when it insists on rolling when everyone else is done with the table. The square’s edges flinched. It did not like the motion. It considered being offended and then was. Squid took a piece of chalk the same shade as a neighbor’s memory of a white fence and drew a big sloppy zero over the painted squares. He did not trace it perfect. He let his hand wobble and told his wrist to remember bad road. The chalk hissed loud enough that the manager one building over stood up in her office and craned her neck.

Imri tied red thread around the nail and held it in his palm until the thread warmed enough to smell like pennies and bicycles. He touched the nail’s head to the painted center dot and spoke a small tight word that a boy uses when someone tries to take his place in line. The dot quivered as if it had been made to feel ridiculous. He remembered copper, bees, grandmother, and then added curve, curve, curve, until the air remembered the porch swing behind Mrs. Daley’s lavender and decided to sway. The squares loosened at the corners as if the paint had realized it was supposed to be accommodating and had been embarrassed into remembering. The door shuddered, then rolled itself up two useless inches and stuck. Inside, something whispered mine again and did not sound like a human’s voice or a policy’s. It sounded like a hollow place that had gotten used to being fed and missed it.

“Hold it,” said a voice that turned sunlight into glass for a second, and Vireo slid into the lane between the rows and into the conversation as if he had been invited the whole time. He carried no mirror today and it was unsettling. His wings had been smeared with a grey that only tried to be humility if you didn’t squint, and his boots had picked up dust that no amount of attention would buff out. He had a new knife that had been a letter opener and had read every rude thing a human had written down with love. He stuck the knife under the door and pried with a wrist that did not show off. The knife bit the latch and the latch forgot to be a corner. The door rolled up enough for a jar to be slid under and stolen by whatever wanted it. It did not happen because Junebug stepped on the jar with a foot more precise than a surgeon’s apology.

“Careful,” Vireo murmured, and it was not a performance but an instruction, which was stranger than any of his glitter or grammar. He nodded toward Imri’s belt where the nail hung. “You tap, I hold the bite. I will not try to make the door admire me. I will let it hate us equally. Does that count as a truce.” The words felt odd in his mouth. He did not dress them in irony. He offered them bare, and he looked a hair smaller for it.

“It counts if you mean it,” Imri said, and placed the nail against the hard rolled lip and tapped in the old cadence, wood, glass, bone, and then the one his grandmother had told him when she had put her hand on his head and told him he was too restless for his size. The door sighed and went up like the breath of a person who has finally admitted their hurt. The inside was boxes and ghost, tarps like folded horizons, a bicycle with its front wheel missing like an amputated promise. The floor glinted with the corners of a hundred things packed into positions that made their usefulness a rumor. At the back, chalked onto the cinderblock wall in a hand that had been taught by someone who loved rulers, was a square inside a square inside a square with the dot at the center, and the dot pulsed with the rhythm of a heart that had made appointment cards for itself.

The air grabbed Imri’s jar with a speed that was rude and then guilty. He stepped forward and the corner of a dresser caught his shin with the irritation of furniture that believed it was in the right and therefore could shout. He hissed something gentle and mean all at once and snagged the jar back with a twist of red thread that left a scratch in the dust like a comma. The jar came reluctantly, fizz draggled and offended, and Junebug cooed at it until it put its molecules back in order. Squid stepped over a man’s coat from 1991 that had not been folded so much as paved. He put his hand on the chalked square with the seriousness of a child petting a dangerous dog. He took his pencil and wrote around the dot: this is not your pantry. He drew an arrow outwards and then another and then another and then he drew a fat short spiral like a snail that had decided to become a road sign. The chalk sank into the cinderblock as if it had been fed, and the square lost its last hint of doctrine.

They did this again and again, and each unit was a new argument with a tone only slightly different from the last, as if someone had recorded complaints and played them back through different types of cardboard. Vireo held a door here, wedged a latch there, did not speak to the units as if they were admirers and did not ask them to love him. He twisted the energy at each corner with the knife until the right angle became a narrow bow, as if some of the rigidness could be coaxed into manners. He did it with a grimace that might have been concentration and might have been memories, and Imri did not ask because the steel did enough asking for both of them. Kinna arrived with two brooms and a dustpan, and the brooms knew exactly how to find the cobweb grief that clung in corners and put it gently in a place where light could talk to it. The manager came with keys she swore under her breath she had never handed out this many times in one day and opened doors for strangers with the knowledge of someone who has learned that privacy and hoarding are not synonyms.

By the time they reached the back row, Imri’s calves had decided to file a complaint with his spine and Junebug’s hair had taken on dust as if it were confetti that had attended the wrong parade. Squid’s fingers were smudged silver from the concrete and the chalk and his own breath, and he had begun to hum, not to himself but to the pencil, which liked a song with numbers—two, four, eight, breathe, two, four. Vireo leaned against a door and let the sound the lock made when it released get into his bones. He closed his eyes for exactly the amount of time it takes to forgive an old error you will make again.

They found, at the very end, a unit that had been left unlatched as if the owner had decided that trust was a better padlock. Inside were boxes with handwritings that made Imri’s heart do the small edges of love: recipes in an aunt’s slow loops, a boy’s fails at spelling taped lovingly to the sides, a calendar page clipped to a photo, telling nobody a thing anyone would want at a yard sale. The chalked square at the back was smaller, as if it had been rebuked by gentleness. Imri stood still in that doorway longer than he needed to. He thought of jars, and nails, and names on doorknobs, and the way threads do not ask to be tended so much as they go on as if they had always been tended whether you are there or not. He drew a circle not with chalk, not with red thread, but with his finger in the air, a gesture his grandmother had taught him to make when a room’s geometry threatened to convince the heart it was a series of neat drawers. He made the circle knowing it would not leave a mark anyone could sell, and it was enough.

When they stepped back into the lane, the heat had lost its knife. The corners were still corners. The doors were still doors. But the policy that had been eating breath had loosened its belt and leaned back in its chair. The manager stood with her ledger under her arm like a baby she trusted to hold its head up. She did not know what had happened in Building C exactly. But she saw Squid’s streaked hands and Vireo’s missing smile and the dust in Junebug’s hair and the way Imri’s jars sat like citizens, and she took the padlock off her mouth long enough to say, “You can come and go when you need to. If anyone asks I will say I cleaned corners and found my own face.”

“What will you charge for that job,” Master Oakes asked, always the one to think of the economy of things, even when the economy was sorrow.

“More than anyone will want to pay,” she said, which was the same as saying she would do it for the cost of pencil lead and shoe leather and a chair to put her back in when it had crouched too long.

They walked out into a heat that had forgotten how to leer and instead remembered how to make grass lie down without complaint. Vireo kept pace with Imri because the town insisted on it and because there was something in his step that made birds consider whether they should try singing something other than their own names. He did not make the air behave like applause. He let it be air. He looked at the storage rows once and then did not look again, which was a mercy. He said, as if asking for a receipt, “You see why I cut hooks. People want order. If you do not hook, some corner will do it for you. Mine at least leaves a face where the corner leaves a number.”

“Your hooks tell the Thread that it is only safe if it knows your face,” Imri said, not cruelly, and they walked past a stand of pine that had shaded boys who had told one another about girls they did not know how to introduce themselves to. “These corners told people that they were safest when no one saw them at all. There’s a difference. It’s not the only difference, but it matters.”

Vireo swung his knife once through a curve in the air and then put it away because he had learned it looked better when you did not show it off. “You are going to win some arguments I would have preferred be undecided,” he said, and he made it sound like a plan of the town rather than a decision of his own. “I am not leaving. I will stop when my hands are tired or when your jars grow teeth and bite me. I will use the nail when you ask me to and I will steal doorways when you forget to guard them. I will make small disasters that let you look heroic at breakfast. You will say no to me in the evening in that voice that makes steel think of trains and we will both sleep badly.”

“Don’t flatter me by pretending we both sleep,” Imri said, and he had the grace to glance away so Vireo could keep the part of his mouth that had remembered how to be honest without the rest of his face noticing. They parted near the dealership where the inflatable had chosen to be a tarp and a boy was kicking it in a way that suggested a future in payroll. Vireo lifted his palm and let it fall without insisting it be a salute. Imri went toward the creek because at this point his feet often did so without asking him to supervise.

He found Squid sitting on the low wall at the substation, because the boy had decided that if magic made him late for pasta night he would at least be late with neat notes. He held up his notebook and it was full of circles, bad ones and perfect ones and one that looked like a pear because he had been hungry. He had written in the margins all the things he could think to label that would make a corner behave: HUGS, ROUNDABOUT, BAGELS, COINS, SKATE WHEELS, MOUTHS YOU WANT TO KISS. He had underlined MOUTHS YOU WANT TO KISS and then scribbled it out to be polite to his future. Imri sat beside him and did not lean in because some children need you near but not hovering. They looked at the creek together the way people look at a fireplace. It was hardly the same, but it did the same work.

“Do you think things remember,” Squid asked after a reasonable silence that admitted the day had been heavy, “when we make them round again. Do they stay round or do they go back because corners are easier to stack.”

“They remember if someone keeps telling the story,” Imri said, and he surprised himself by not making it poetry even though poetry was sitting on his tongue making faces. “A circle is not a shape you learn once. It’s something hands need to do over and over until they want to. That’s why pies were invented. That’s why we have the way you sharpen pencils.”

Squid nodded. He did not smile because he had decided that smiles were only for when you had chosen the right size of victory and today had been too many sizes at once. He packed his pencils away like pets, slid off the wall, and took a shortcut through a hedge where a startled cat made a sound like a political opinion. Junebug appeared in his wake with a handful of marbles that she did not intend to return to any child unless bribed with a lug nut made of pure sugar. She shoved three into Imri’s palm and he rolled them. They hummed like worlds.

The Parliament met that night not to decide but to learn what deciding had done. Kinna cut a slice of someone’s overconfident cinnamon bread and passed it around as if it were a sacrament designed to make teeth talk. Master Oakes sat with his broom beside him like a friend who had brought a casserole. Pash and Pash had learned to make ovals with their hand game and were bored of them until they realized they were easier to live with than corners. Imri told as little story as he could because the words themselves might look like hooks if left too glittery. He spoke of boxes and chalk and the way a policy dies when a child labels it wrong and believes it. He left Vireo’s knife out of it, because generosity is a better weapon in public than on the page.

Later, under the breath of the attic where dust had worked out its own politics, Imri placed one of Junebug’s marbles at the corner of a map that should have been art but was, for now, only a way to remember the paths he had taken. He put the marble there so the corner would have company. It shone in its own small way. He set the nail next to it and the two of them sat like punctuation that had decided to be less final. He thought of the storage units’ rooms and the catcalls of the padlocks and the policy voice inside the painted squares. He thought of Vireo’s hands holding his nail and telling a hook to soften without making it fall in love with him first. He thought of the way the Thread had not wanted what it could not have and had become better company for it.

He drifted out the window into an evening that had learned to creak again in the right places. He did not go to the bridge at once. He went to the park where mothers watched their children like saints ready to unsheathe, and he walked the lines between swings and slide and sandbox until the ground understood it was a circle drawn by feet and that circles could keep things safe if they were drawn with enough breath. He went to the lot behind the tire shop where rubber still exhaled yesterday’s rage and told it stories about wheels that had learned to let go. He went to the churchyard, laid his palm on the boundary stone that had heard a thousand names spoken with too much fear, and told it quietly that circles of people would stand there next week and the week after and that it would hold them without corners. He went to the bridge last, because he trusted it, and because leaving a friend waiting is how you tell them you know they can wait.

The Thread met him with the patience of older things. He set his jars along the lip and let them sing to the bolts and the bolts sang back, and somewhere deep in the water a fish learned to take the kind of curve that would keep it from a child’s line. He said copper, bees, grandmother, and then he said three words he had learned that day he had needed without knowing he would: circle, circle, circle. He said them until the echo made a room out of air and the room had no corners and the walls bowed the way kindness does. He whispered not to the bridge or to the water but to the picture of the town he carried between his ribs, which is a muscle that learns shapes if you ask it to. He told it: we will be round when we can, we will be square when there is a shelf that requires it, we will know the difference and not apologize for choosing.

On the far side of town where the zinnias had put on socks and gone to bed, a boy with painted wings looked at a brass survey marker set proud in a slab of rock beside the road, a perfect disk that had always believed itself important and had never been shown another way. He reached for his knife and then did not. He pressed his thumb to the stamped words that told distance and elevation and the height of human ambition, and he did not whisper mine. He said a word that was so small it did not disturb the mosquitoes. He said maybe. He said it twice and then began to turn a plan around like a coin, testing the weights, deciding whether spectacle could be taught to bow to mending without sulking forever.

Morning would bring a letter slipped under the grammar sign about a book exchange that had sprouted on a corner where nothing grew because corners do not like to be neighborly, and the letters would be cut out of magazines and glued down with a stubbornness that would offend the neat. Afternoon would bring thunder that had the sense to go around softball practice, and someone would sigh and call it luck while Imri whispered Thread. Evening would bring Vireo to the edge of a conversation he did not start and did not ruin. Night would bring the hum of the trains and the moths like poorly drawn ovals and the feeling in the air that contracts were being written by small hands who believed in circles and would never learn to be ashamed of that. Imri slept with the nail near his ear and did not dream of corners. He dreamed of loops that tied themselves and then loosened in time to keep breathing. He dreamed of a town that would never be a show and would therefore be the kind of miracle people live inside without noticing until someone brings a nail to a corner and taps three times, then three, then again.By the third morning after the storage lanes had been coaxed into shapes that could breathe without insisting on ownership, Mooresville woke to the sound of tent poles arguing with the sky. Trucks as large as unedited sentences backed into the fairground by Back Creek, and men and women in shirts that had once known white wrestled canvas that smelled like old popcorn and rain trapped too long. The carnival had come the way it always did, late in the summer, after peaches but before school supply lists turned into scripture, bright and tired and promising secrets only it had rehearsed. Children looked out of cars with their hands already sticky on the backs of their mothers’ seats and measured themselves against rides with names written in kind of lettering that insisted it was thrilling to be terrified. The creek lifted itself to watch and then pretended it had only been seeing how it looked when it squinted.

Imri knew how the carnival changed the town’s threads. It set them humming in new keys. It hung light where there should be dusk. It scraped music over gravel and told the moths to reconsider their religion. The second time he had tended the Second Thread there had been a boy who decided to run away into the maze of vans and had learned that magic could be ordinary and kind and let him devise a more dramatic escape the next year with the help of pine sap and a dog who told lies. The maze that year had been one of canvas and sloppy paint brushed in a hurry. This year, the crew unloaded mirrors. They leaned them against a truck and they reflected everything they could, which is to say, not much at all, because the air was full of dust and the creek’s fog had been practicing for autumn. But even under a film of grit, the mirror maze glittered with the promise of a dozen faces looking the way you wanted to see them.

Vireo was made for lights and reflection, which meant the maze was made for him, and Imri could feel the itch in the air that meant Vireo had already walked past and had been so gracious as not to bow. He stood at the edge of the field where the grass had been cut into lines that said the truck must go here and not over there, and he watched men with tired jokes lift mirror after mirror into a skeleton built of wishful thinking. Each pane flashed an arrowhead of sun at him and he let it sting his eyes and then go, as if the light had asked to be allowed to wander and he had merely held the gate open.

Junebug arrived with a strip of prize tickets around her neck like a laurel made of little promises. She had stolen them, but in a way that would be repaid because she always left something better where she took something, and the ticket boy would find a pocketful of luck he would not be able to spend and decide to get a haircut he would not regret until next season. She clambered up onto the harness of the Ferris wheel as if gravity had been busy elsewhere, and waved in a way that made the carnival men dismiss her in the polite way they dismissed every motion they could not own. “They brought the mirror maze again,” she said, not masking her glee with anything so sensible as caution. “It swallowed a little girl in 2004 and told us she was taller than she had been when she came out. She was so proud of that it felt rude to be angry.”

“Mirrors preen on their own without Vireo’s help,” Imri said, and ran his thumb over the edge of a jar until it thrummed because it had been asked to. “I don’t like them looking this direction. They’ll try to make the creek into a vanity and the creek will be insulted for weeks.”

“Maybe the creek should take a compliment for once in its wet life,” Junebug said, but her tone had grown wary under its bright. “Barkers with red loudspeakers have been asking for the moon since before we were ideas. The mirror man is not a barker, though. He eats salt out of a paper cone and doesn’t make eye contact with the high school girls when he takes their tickets. He hangs bells where nobody can see them. The bells feel like a pocket full of somebody else’s keys. I can’t whistle at him and throw him off his game. He doesn’t listen to whistles. He listens to clicks.”

Imri did not say that clicks meant someone had collected a rhythm out of locks. He did not say that Vireo listened to the same. He watched the bones of the maze rise and be dressed in sheets of glass cut to fit only accidentally, as if the carpenter had been taught math by a flirt and had only paid attention to the parts that could be used over dinner. The maze breathed before anyone entered it. It breathed inward. He felt it pull. He did not mind being pulled toward most things—into water, into shade, into conversation with friendly cats—but the feeling in the maze’s breath was not invitation. It was curiosity with teeth.

By dusk, lights had taken hold and the fairground had been arranged to encourage the inefficient. Children ran the wrong direction on purpose because their feet needed to say yes to something. Women told men they were ridiculous and bought the same men fried dough. High school boys stood near the Tilt-A-Whirl with their hands in their pockets as if they had stolen good posture from someone who had not been watching. Vireo showed up as naturally as thunder at a fireworks show. He wore a shirt cut from the kind of map you buy in tourist stores that makes a city look like a puzzle that could be solved with a decent lunch and a brochure. He had rubbed ash on his wings to dull them and then, because he could not help himself, had dusted it with gold in three places so anyone who paid attention would know he’d tried to be humble and had failed in a way that made him prettier. He glanced at the Ferris wheel once and it leaned half an inch toward him out of habit.

He found Imri because Imri did not decide to hide. “Are we blessing a maze,” Vireo asked, tasting the word bless as if it had come from an older language he had once learned out of spite. “Or are we refusing it. You carry your nail. Will you tack your approval to its doorway like a parish notice.”

“I’ll put my nail in its mouth if it eats a child,” Imri said, and he felt the weight of the nail press into his hip as if it had been listening to his threats and disapproved. “Until then, we watch. We tell the lights they are allowed to fail in place. We warn the mirrors that making endless versions of a thing is not the same as understanding it.”

“You are cruel,” Vireo said, not unkindly. “You say such sensible things to people who would be content with gloss. Do you ever just let a crowd be a crowd”

“When the crowd has more mercy than it has spectacle,” Imri said. “I will let them be. When the crowd sharpens because someone sharpens it, I will take the whetstone away.”

They drifted to the maze. The man at the entrance had a face that good daughters would trust without being told to. He took tickets and counted without saying numbers aloud and knew when to pretend he had lost track so a boy could save face and be handed back two tickets he had not wanted to give up. His sign said House of Reflections and someone had drawn a mustache on the gaudy woman pictured on it years ago and had not been corrected because she looked happier with it. Imri put his hand on the canvas beside the entrance. He felt unresolved things tying knots to themselves inside. Junebug sidled in under a flap because she liked to be surprised from the inside. Vireo did the unforgivable and paid.

Inside, the world slid. Families entered with their hands grappling for the right fingers and then were smudged into careful caution. The mirrors bent light like it was gossip, and the gossip was not kind. It took people’s shoulders in and made their eyes look like raccoon eyes and then, when they laughed at that, it did not laugh back. It showed them versions of themselves that were almost true, and people always wanted to forgive “almost.” The algorithm of the maze made the easiest path, not the shortest, but the one that would make you see the face you had been thinking about in your bed when you could not sleep. It was rude that the maze knew the same trick as prayer.

Imri brushed his fingers over a seam and caught a sound that did not belong to the evening. It was like a bell that had been tuned to a dial tone. He followed it and he felt the house respond not to him, but to the next person who had been taught to respond to bells. That person was Squid’s mother. She had been co-opted by an aunt into bringing three extra children and their sugar to the carnival, and she had walked into the maze because it was not a ride that made you distrust steel. The maze found the place in her where corners had learned to close to keep something from falling out, and it laid a little mirror on that place and said: look how neat you are when your hands are empty. She froze. She laughed. She held one of the extra children by the wrist and the child’s wrist never forgot it, not in any way that would break, but in a way that would draw circles whenever a teacher asked for straight lines. Squid’s mother took one more step and the maze took three.

Junebug launched herself off the top of a bumper, slid down a panel meant to look like velvet, and smacked into Imri because she did not love the way the maze liked corners. “She’s in the wrong place,” she said without needing to say a name. “It’s telling her that if she lets go nothing will require her. It’s telling her that emptiness is the same as peace. It’s telling her that mirrors keep secrets. We have to make it break its own grammar.”

Vireo had leaned his forehead against a panel and was listening as if it had been made to sing only for him and was refusing him as a favor. “They hung bells high,” he said. “In the corners. They’re not bells that ring to tell you where you are. They’re bells that ring to tell the house how the people inside are arranged. It reads the clicks. It uses them to fold light. I can make bells sing a different rhythm but I will make a spectacle and your boy with the notebooks will be on my side for a week and you will hate me for it. Or I can cut three strings and the house will not know where you are and it will panic and smooth you out with glare and the littler ones will cry. Or I can do the quiet thing and you will owe me a favor, which is an oven I always keep warm.”

Imri wanted to say no because no was a virtue and he wore it like a belt. But the maze had a mechanic and mechanics like to be turned with the tool they were built for. He unhooked his nail, felt its weight, placed it in the hand of a mirror that had been made to show someone’s waist smaller. “Hold this,” he told the mirror. He did not say who he was talking to. He tapped the nail’s head with the lightest touch of his tooth and felt the echo run through the pipes he could not see. He let the second jar on his belt uncork very slightly, just enough to let a trickle of honest radio static escape, the kind that has learned what night beans gossip about and tells no one. The house listened. He said copper and bees and grandmother, but he said them like instructions. The nail shivered and hummed, and the bells overhead vibrated in sympathy.

Vireo slid between two panels without moving the air and left three ridiculous little bows on strings that controlled three bells. He did not cut them because he had learned there is a difference between stealth and vandalism. He loosened them just enough to make the bells sulk. Junebug climbed onto the painted rafters and draped a length of monofilament line across the path that the maze thought everyone would take next. She tied to it bottle caps that had learned to be polite and then whispered a sweeter insult at them until they remembered their tin and rattled like rain. Squid, who had gotten into the maze without paying because he had been writing numbers in the dust until the entrance forgot to be watched, drew arrows on the floor with chalk with messy heads that told feet how to be confident without lying. He wrote in small staccato letters at a turn the maze had been using as a lesson: you are not lost.

The maze wavered. Its geometry wanted to insist. The bells tried to count and landed on different numbers in different corners and the house tried to hum with itself and could not find the key. In the place where Squid’s mother stood with one child’s wrist in her hand and two children’s names simmering on her tongue, something very small unthreaded. It was a habit more than it was a vow. It was the habit of counting the hours until bedtime by turning them into boxes, and the boxes had their corners sanded down by a chalk line that carried the word you three times under its breath. She came to the next mirror and did not see a woman whose edges could be cleaned up with effort. She saw a woman who had held three different kinds of crying in one room and had let each cry be itself and had not stacked them in a corner. She let go of the child’s wrist, not because she was less careful but because she could count without touching. The child stepped forward with a stride that did not bruise itself on corners and said the obvious thing that adults are rude enough to forget: “There’s the line on the ground. Go there.”

Imri bent his ear to the nail and listened for the place where the house’s clicks had been made to feel like orders. He tapped three times—wood, glass, bone—and then three more—bone, glass, wood—and then three more with the rhythm his grandmother had used when she knocked on his head to ask if it was full and honest. The house calmed like a dog that had been told to sit by someone who had learned to say the word with both vowel and patience. The mirrors went from showing to reflecting. People tumbled out the far exit laughing with their hairs out of place and the maze let them think it had taught them something clever. It had not. The maze had been taught an ordinary politeness.

Vireo held one of the loosened bell strings in his fist and did not burn it for a trick or tighten it for a laugh. He looked at the exit as if the air beyond it owed him interest. “You are making me redundant,” he said without heat. “If you teach towns to mend themselves, what will be left for clever boys with mirrors.”

“Plenty,” Imri said, setting the nail back on his belt so it knocked gently once to say hello to the jar beside it. “You can build. You can coax the vanity out of a river’s reflection when it has had a bad week and tell it the cattails still adore it. You can teach a parade to point its lion costume toward the sun. You can make a girl’s hand on a softball feel like the moment before music starts. We have work that is not theft.”

Vireo tipped his head back and let the carnival’s light throw him into strategies. “Your speeches keep sounding like tools,” he said, but his mouth softened at the corner because he had not learned yet to hide approval in his face and he was not going to practice tonight. He threw his hands up and the Ferris wheel pretended not to see the gesture and turned, and the boy up top whispered into his girlfriend’s ear that the lights were beautiful and then hated himself for cliché and she forgave him without hearing his apology.

They stood at the fence and the fence learned their names in its old wire memory and grinned without moving. Children ran past with strings that had once been attached to balloons and now attached each child to someone else’s wrist. Junebug claimed three tickets without asking and gave them to a person who had never in his life won a raffle. Squid leaned against the back of the House of Reflections with his pencil between his teeth and wrote in his notebook without looking because he had learned the maze’s geometry by feel. He wrote: bells, chalk, nail, not sorry, go, and then shaded a circle very dark and let his breath slow inside it.

The night fell harder on the far side of the fairgrounds where the backs of the rides showed their ribs. The generators coughed and bit and kept running because they knew only one trick and they liked doing it. The creek sang the kind of song that makes leaves shudder in a way that looks like pleasure. Imri followed that sound without meaning to, and Vireo did the thing he does when the crowd is behind him that he won’t admit is following. They went down into the seam where carnival light does not choose to go and found a man sitting with his shoes off and his stomach out and the bad light on his face that you get when a mirror has remembered your bad year and tries to sell it back to you for the price of fried dough. He had not been lost in the maze. He had been released by it and then discovered that the road back to being only himself was longer than he would like.

Imri knew him because he had bought a doorknob with a little boy’s handprint on it at the antique store and had wept in the stairwell until the stairwell had felt personally successful. He had a daughter who ran bases as if someone had told her she would be thanked for being fast. He had a wife who ironed receipts into flat history. He had a job that had changed what it calls itself three times in two years and paid him the same all along. He had taken his shoes off because the ground looked like water and he wanted something to be river if he could not have river. Vireo sat down beside him with the shrug of a man who has decided to be kind because formal cruelty would take too much energy to dress. “It reflects what you bring to it,” he said. “If you bring it tired it gives you angles that want a nap. If you bring it grief it gives you jaws big enough to chew. What did you bring it.”

The man did not look at him because he did not yet have the spare respect Imri had for pretty boys in polite boots. He looked into the dark and said, “I brought it a face I have had for many years without ever having to hold it under a light this bright. I thought I could walk out and keep the mirrors, but they do this trick where they pretend to be truth and you bring them home. I have those now. Hush. Let me sit with them.”

Imri did not say truth was thin. He did not say that truth is a wheel and the spokes matter as much as the rim. He put a jar down on the dirt near the man’s hand and let it hum low enough to smooth grass. Vireo did the thing Imri had not expected of him ever. He took off his mirror. He set it face down on the dirt by the man’s other hand. He said, “When you look tomorrow you will see my boot print on the back. You can decide to be comforted by the fact that even mirrors have backs. You can decide that the smell of fried dough is better admired in the air than on the tongue. You can decide to be a man who steps on mirrors and does not feel obliged to apologize to the sky for the crunch.”

The man made a sound that began as a laugh and apologized halfway and then did not apologize after all. He put his toes in the creek for the exact perfect amount of time and took them out as if he had remembered a thing you can only remember if someone lets you. He tied his shoes, not like a metaphor, but like a man going home with more room in his mouth for his daughter’s loudness. He nodded once at Imri and did not nod at Vireo because he did not know yet that he might owe him something later, and he did not have to. Vireo knew he had made a good act of theater and he had done it where no one could applaud and it nearly killed him and it nearly saved him and those sorts of near things are what people use when they learn to keep breathing after they stop thinking they are the only person with lungs.

The fair wound down around them in a halo of too-sweet, too-loud, too-bright. The House of Reflections made its peace with a line of six-year-olds carrying corn dogs like torches and decided it would angle them toward their mothers’ faces for one night and make them feel adored. The bells flashed their tongues at each other and decided they would argue with the chalk tomorrow. Junebug took a small gift from the air and did not admit she had. Squid went home for pasta night and took his pencils into the bathroom because he had been told once not to, and this was as good a day to disobey as any.

Back at the attic, Kinna sat with her braid undone because sometimes a victory that did not announce itself wanted to be attended with unfastened hair. She listened to Imri’s version of short, which was shorter than it would have been last week, and she looked at Vireo like she had a note to pin to his sleeve and could not decide whether to write be good or be better. Master Oakes ate a length of taffy with slow concentration because he liked the way sweets affected his ability to say old words. The twins Pash and Pash had acquired balloons and were teaching them to keep secrets.

When the room had emptied of the human family that felt the Parliament without seeing it, when the jars had finished listing the rides they preferred in the vocabulary of fizz, when the nail had settled into the coil of Imri’s belt and declared itself comfortable, Kinna stared at the boards above them and said, “Tomorrow the surveyors finish their laser thing by the road with the zinnias. They think only of lines. They will hammer small orange flags that will tell people where to think. We will have to be standing where a line thinks it will go and tell it not to get cocky. Bring me you, and bring me the boy with the pencils, and bring me the handsome loud creature who sometimes does good and then tries to sell it to the mirror.”

Vireo bowed like a man bending low not because he wanted to show his neck, but because he had been practicing the muscle and admired his own success. “You will buy me with work,” he said. “This is indecent. Continue.”

Imri walked home by way of the depot, because the trains were singing the good song they sing when two meet just outside of town and tell each other what they have seen, and he could not bear to miss the way the rails hum when they talk like that. He released a jar and let it catch two small kindnesses. He held the nail in his palm and let it cool. He thought of the way the maze had swallowed and the way the maze had let go. He thought of how there are corners in a woman who never shows them, and the kindness it is to tape over them for a minute. He thought of Vireo setting down his mirror with the face down where dirt could comfort it, and he could not decide whether that had been the bravest or the laziest thing he had seen him do.

The morning found the surveyors with their tripods and their lenses that made far things tell the truth, and with a young woman in boots standing by the marker disk Vireo had touched last evening, tapping a pen against her teeth and asking the air to be reasonable. She had the air of someone who loved an angle because it stayed what it said it was while her life quietly refused to. She was writing a new version of old lines for the developers across from the zinnias, and her lines would be the ones men argued with in court while their wives held hands under tables and asked their bones to be sturdy. She did not see Imri when he stood in the grass because his gentleness made him a shadow when he wanted to be. She did not see Vireo because he made shadows behave and step away from him if he wanted them to look like an accident. She did see Squid, because children who politely stand out of the way but watch with attention deserve to be used as an honest surface to bounce words off, and she said, “These lines will go where they should, and the flags will let your neighbors rest easy. No dog will be shot this year for trespassing. You can thank me when you have time.”

Imri put his hand on the disk beside her boot and felt the hum that lives in government metal. It is not magic, what governments do to metal. It is insistence tempered into alloy. It is certain words hammered into obedience. It is a promise so dry it cuts. He told the disk that he did not mind if it said how far the earth was from the place humans preferred to measure from, but that it would not tell threads where to lie. The disk listened the way a machine listens, that is to say, politely, and then did what it had planned. Vireo crouched and blew softly over the numbers until his breath warmed them and made them remember a mouth. He did not claim them. He reminded them of summers when people had propped their feet on the markers and eaten plums and told stories that had not been recorded anywhere except in mouths. The numbers loosened invisibly. Numbers are not law. They are appetite, and can be taught to eat better.

They pressed small circles around orange flags and made them less proud. They tied one with red thread and told it that while it could stand as bright as a foolish shirt, its shadow should not cross the creek, because the creek had decided it would not behave for anyone with a stapler. The surveyor watched her lines appear on a screen and patted the screen like a child because when a person makes a thing appear where there had been only air the day before, they deserve to be indulged. She took a breath that fought with itself on the way in and then decided that even if she could not move her own life’s boundary stones, she could place these flags fairly and keep someone’s grandmother from crying about eight square feet of blackberry.

“Your flags will insult the zinnias,” Kinna said, stepping to a place where the woman could both see and not see her and speaking with the authority of someone who had grown children out of spice and dirt. “Put one there. Tighten that one. Move that one three inches or it will teach a dog to hate early mornings. Good. Let go of the one in your left hand or it will cut you and make you think it was your fault.”

The surveyor’s fingers did as they were told because old women sometimes sound like old kings, and the flags fell straight and then breathed and then sat, and the wind did not try to learn to square itself. Vireo carried two without making a remark about the absurdity of holding lines, and Imri carried one and told it stories about circles until it grew charming and offended its own angles.

By afternoon the orange flickers made a small polite fence along the field, and the field looked back at them with a patience that would have been holy except that patience is not a virtue for grass. Grass is a confession. It says: I will grow anyway. Imri tucked the nail against his wrist bone and the rhythm of his pulse took to it as if trains had always been a secret inside him. Squid wrote more circles in the dust than were strictly necessary and then connected three to make a snowman because his mother had kissed him on the hair as she left that morning and he had decided it made season irrelevant. Vireo squinted at the horizon and did not turn his head because he had heard a noise he had been hoping he had imagined. The noise was men in a truck talking about a tower that would be built in a place that had been told that height was an insult only last week.

They would fight that tower or they would make it bow. They would mend things that would teach no one to applaud. They would let the town call itself lucky and nod along and not say show me the receipts. They would avoid corners when corners acted like teeth, and they would close circles when circles acted like the kind of softness that can be mistaken for a trick. They would eat cinnamon bread that made their tongues disobedient and laugh with mouths full of honest heat, and they would let themselves be tired and then not let tiredness decide anything important.

Night made itself comfortable and the trains coughed distance into the rails and let it evaporate like breath on glass. In the attic, Kinna put a coin in a jar because she claimed superstition requires payment and then forgot to take it out because age learns the miracle of surplus. Master Oakes fell asleep with his broom in his hand and no one took it from him because the broom liked his dreams. Junebug stole three marbles from herself and rejoiced unconvincingly. Vireo sat on a sill at the edge of the attic and held Imri’s nail in his palm for the length of a swallow and then returned it to its place without a flourish because sometimes the best magic is to do mundane things in a way that looks like work.

Imri slept late and woke early in the way of boys whose days do not ask their permission and do not yet apologize for it. He put his hand on the bridge because habits are a way of keeping corners honest. He whispered to the Thread because it had remembered how to be without wanting to be someone else. He let his hair be terrible and went where he needed to go and did not look at mirrors unless he was prepared to forgive them. He said copper, bees, grandmother, circle, go, stay, and sometimes he threw them all at the air and rejoiced when they landed making a shape he had not asked for but could learn to use. He went into the day. The day did not applaud. It took his shoulders like a friend and pushed.The notice went up on City Hall like a dare. Its paper was the good kind that resists weather for a week and then gives up with dignity, and its letters were the bureaucratic blue that looks friendly from twenty feet and unassailable from two. IMMEDIATE PUBLIC HEARING: COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT, it said, as if improvements were the same as kindness. The grammar-sign shop owner stood across Broad and squinted until the font flinched. She did not have a stamp for what was wrong with it, so she took out a stub of red pencil and underlined the word improvement in the air three times, and the underline hung there like a breeze that had been reminded of its manners. Imri read the edges because edges held intent; the piece of paper had traveled there in a municipal folder that had once held a map of snow routes and never quite stopped smelling like salt. The day got brighter around it the way a dog stands and wags when it knows it will be asked to do something it already wanted to do.

At the attic, the Parliament arranged its chairs into an argument and then softened them into an embrace because disagreements do better when the furniture does not pretend to be a judge. Kinna had wrapped measuring tape into her braid and the numbers looked good there, as if they were pleased to be attached to someone who would not make them lie. Master Oakes had borrowed a gavel from somewhere and was tapping the broom with it gently to teach both tools to cooperate. Junebug had attempted to fold the notice into a paper crane and it had refused to become a bird, which she took personally. Vireo leaned against the south window where the town fit into his pupils in a way that would have made a less careful boy turn his eyes into a stage. He raised the notice to his nose and inhaled like a sommelier praising a wine he intended to water down. “There will be cake,” he said, not guessing. “There is always cake at these occasions. Men who ask a town to swallow height bring sweets to numb the throat.”

Squid sat with his knees pressed to a chair rung and a notebook open to a page labeled TOWER: NOISES. He had written HISS, WHINE, HUM, BRAG, and then scratched them out because he had learned that words you write too early are rude to the day. He had two red pencils and a black pen and one charcoal stick that made his fingers look like they had tried to flirt with a chimney. “I will correct their commas,” he said softly, and nobody laughed because commas change laws.

The hearing filled up quietly, the way creeks fill in July, inch by inch until the frogs discover they are no longer on land. Mothers came in pairs the way bees do when the hive agrees on danger. Fathers came alone because someone had to and made room at their own elbows for their wives’ opinions. Boys who would not admit to caring about towers sat at the back and made an art of sneering without committing to it. The dais held three things older than the mayor: the clock, the flag with the stain from the funeral in 1983, and the scratch on the wood that had never been sanded out because it was said Mrs. Harper had made it when she put her ring down before speaking and no one had contradicted her since. The representatives of the company arranged themselves like chess pieces that had brought their own board. They smiled the way you do after dentist appointments and before first bites of pie. The tall one had a tie the exact gray of a ceiling, and when he bent his head his hair made brief shadows on his paper that looked like apologies. The young woman with the maps tapped distances into grace. The man with the surveys did not cough once because he had learned not to draw attention unless he intended to win it.

They said words like coverage and safety and reliability. They said words like increased, improved, enhanced. They offered a picture of a tower disguised as a tree, which only convinced the audience that someone had seen trees and misunderstood them. They pointed to the orange flags and promised not to insult the zinnias except in the way that was inevitable. They promised that birds would not be inconvenienced, and the crows outside laughed so loudly that the clerk dropped three paper clips and a belief. On the side wall the grammar-sign owner had put up a hand-lettered piece that read COMMENT PERIOD in straight lines that looked like a backbone with opinions, and below it in smaller letters: speak into the air as if it kept receipts.

Imri did not go to the microphone first because he had not learned to love the taste of his voice amplified. He stood where the light from the high windows fell onto the floor and let his foot find a rhythm the nail liked, tapping in his boot just enough to make the clock on the wall remember the train schedules it had once hoped to defy. He watched Vireo, who was not bored because boredom cannot stand rooms that think they are the most important thing. Vireo was calculating whether he preferred to run a Thread up that height and make it sing for him, or to unsettle the room the way a boy flips a table in a cafeteria because he wants to see who picks up the milk. He looked tempted by the height and then angry at himself for being so obvious. Junebug vibrated in place like mischief learning patience and wrote on her arm in pen: DO NOT INTERRUPT THE CHOIR unless absolutely necessary.

When Imri did speak, it was not through the town’s metal mouth. He turned and faced the rows like a man telling a story at the end of a meal he had not cooked. “There is a Thread here,” he said, and he knew it made most people think of sewing and wishes and he did not mind. “Under the bridge. Along the creek. It is not a superstition. It is not a legend that bumps its head on a new car and stops. It’s the way the town holds itself together without asking permission. We have been mending it. We have been telling it it is not a mirror. When you raise something higher than it needs to be, it will be a mirror. It will collect faces and not know what to do with them. It will want. Want is a hunger with good grammar. We can teach it to eat slowly. But it will be a lot of work to make whatever you build want kindness.”

The tall tie man nodded as if taking an elective in folklore was on his list if he ever retired. “We appreciate the historical context,” he said, meaning we appreciate your language like we appreciate iced tea at a picnic someone else paid for. “We have conducted studies. We have held impact meetings. We have consulted the necessary…” he hesitated, his tongue looking for the right shelf to take a word from and finding only jargon “…stakeholders. The tower will be elegant. You’ll forget it’s there.”

“You never forget the thing that makes you talk different,” a woman said from the second row, and her voice made the light in the windows hesitate. She was Squid’s mother and her hair still smelled like pasta and the bathroom cleaner he had spilled when trying to be helpful. “You only pretend to. You start saying can you hear me and then you stop asking because the bars tell you to be confident. We will be louder because we can. Who do we want to be loud for. Who will listen. You boys always think loud makes it honest.”

A shuffle like wind through paper moved through the room. The clerk adjusted her glasses the way a person says yes without writing it down. The mayor put his hand on the scratch Mrs. Harper had made and remembered being twenty-three and thinking every line you draw on a map is fair because the pencil says so. Vireo smiled in a way that made the lights above them hum and then grow too shy to flicker. He had decided to show off and then decided not to. His hands itched like unspent trouble.

When they opened the floor, the grammar-sign owner went to the microphone and, without introduction, read aloud the parts of the notice that used passive voice. People laughed the way you laugh at a man who trips and then does a better bow than anyone expected. Master Oakes took a turn and talked about wind. He did not make a speech. He told a story about a day in 1969 when you could throw your hat in the air at the depot and the wind would bring it back because it knew your head, and people believed him the way the tired believe good pillows. Kinna said nothing at the microphone. She walked the perimeter of the room and touched the wood of the trim where it had been nicked by chair after chair, and the wood steadied because she was there. This is how rooms vote when nobody counts their hands.

On the lawn after, the company men shook hands with oranges. They had brought crates of them because someone in a meeting had said the town liked fresh fruit and this was easier than learning the names of the ladies who made pie. Vireo took an orange and rolled it between his palms as if training it to be obedient. “You want me to stop this tower,” he said without preamble, to Imri, to the air, to anyone who would make his choice a test. “Say please. I like the word in your mouth when it knows it is not something you owe me.”

Imri thought about it longer than he would have last week. He looked at the flags along the zinnias and at the creek pretending not to eavesdrop and at the crows listing grievances to anyone who would listen. “No,” he said finally, careful and almost fond. “I want the town to stop the tower. I want you to make the air honest if they insist. I want you to help only in a way you will not be able to turn into a leash later. I want you to practice mending until you cannot bear the thought of cutting.”

Vireo bit into the orange without peeling it and winced because he deserved it. He spit the taste out with a grace that applied even to mess. “I could speak to their guts,” he said. “I could make the contractor wake in the night and think of bolts loosening and come to you with a confession you did not deserve to be offered. Or I could take the tower when it stands and make it sing to the creek and not to their blinking little bars. They would think they had improved something measurable. Their children would go to bed not knowing why their teeth hummed. You would hate me and thank me, in that order.”

“We could also submit the forms with too much red pencil,” Squid said from their knees, because he liked lawn and honesty. “They gave us thirty days. That is a month if you start on a Monday. We can make their paper argue with itself and no one will ever know why they are tired. If you ruin their tower they will just build a different one on a hill where we are not watching. If we make their words tired, they will decide to sell a smaller tower to a different town whose creek bites. That is still mean, but it is mean with a budget and a calendar, which I know how to fight.” He looked very young saying it and very old the minute after.

The thirty days acquired a taste. It tasted like coffee you drink standing up and like the inside of an envelope torn with careful fingers and like the way a town becomes itself in the quiet hallways of the building where people argue about recycling. Junebug put on shoes that could run on carpet without squeaking and moved through offices like a draft that makes calendars flutter. She stole one pen with a logo so ugly it made her remember there are worse crimes than spelling, and she put two pennies on the clerk’s desk each morning with a note that said nothing a person could read and everything that a habit could. Master Oakes made cookies that looked exactly like the ones women bring when they are about to ask for a favor, and he brought them without asking for one, which made everyone frightened and eager to give him something before he asked. Kinna taught the teenagers with the petitions how to stand not like heroes but like courtesy trained to lift its chin. She made them practice saying thank you to the man who yelled, because sometimes not yelling back is the only magic you can afford in a week.

Imri went to the creek and asked it if it had ever held anything that tall. The creek reminded him it had once touched the sky during a storm and had been unimpressed. He talked to the Thread about thinness and light and the way air can be asked to behave like wire. He put his hand on the bridge and said: if they build it we will teach it to bend. He whispered to the bolts in the fake pine that had been delivered on a flatbed like a sermon, and the bolts whispered back, surprised to be consulted. He slipped a jar into the hollow of the tower’s lowest segment while the men left for lunch and told the jar to listen without flattery. The jar listened the way paper listens when you fold it into a bird and promise it children will adore it. It came back that night humming the hungry song of a thing that wants to be ladder and will not be satisfied until it has your feet.

Vireo practiced restraint until it made him sweat. He hovered at the edges of rooms where men in ties prayed to numbers and tugged gently on the curtains so the light would make them think of mornings that had not yet forgiven them for promising. He argued with himself without an audience and lost. He picked up Imri’s nail once, when no one was looking, and tapped it against a railing on the second floor of City Hall, just once, and a deputy in a back office put his pen down and went home to tell his wife he did not want one more fight about Saturdays. He could not decide whether he had helped or meddled and it made him pace until his boots left lines in carpet that had previously been proud of not remembering anyone’s feet. On a yellow afternoon charred with August, he caught a teenager on the sidewalk trying to learn to whistle with two fingers in his mouth and said, “Bend your knuckles, not because it looks clever, but because it changes the angle of your breath.” The boy whistled, was shocked into joy, and Vireo felt the strange quiet that comes with having done something real that required no witnesses.

At night, the men with the tower’s instructions sat at their motel with their shoes off and their socks clipped to the air conditioner and learned that Mooresville had a temperature in it that did not correspond to the weather. The young woman with the boots who loved angles called her mother and did not talk about flags or men. She talked about the house that would be ripped up two counties west and the woman who had lived there for forty years and the way line weight on a map can look like mercy and not be. She put her head in her hands and Vireo, who had followed her voice along the narrow hallway because it had a sound he could not resist, stood outside the window screen and for once did not lean in. He let her draw breath in three hitches and then steady. He offered the air nothing and it kept the secret gratefully.

The night before the vote that would not be called a vote because nice words prefer to wear veils, a storm gathered itself like a grandmother with a heavy purse and a good reason to be on your porch. Thunder said the old obvious thing and lightning threw pearls into the creek just to see if it could find them in the morning. The fake pine, bolted in sections so neatly it could have been a child’s toy, took a hit in its top third. The men would later call it an unfortunate strike. The town would call it the appropriate kind of coincidence. Imri called it an opportunity and so did Vireo, which is why they met there without deciding to. Junebug climbed into the branches that weren’t branches, her wet dress dragging insects along for the ride that fell off and laughed at themselves for having signed up for charade. The bolts had held because bolts like to show off in front of weather. The sparking was not visible and not gone. The tower held its breath like a child waiting to see if the vase broke loud enough for a parent to come.

Imri unhooked the jar he had hidden and opened it under his shirt so the rain would not feel rebuked and the static fell out into his palm and spread thin and obedient. He spoke copper and bees and grandmother and added city hall because sometimes naming a building is the same as tying it to your belt. He could feel the tower’s want, huge and simple. He had felt want in the Thread and it had been frightening because the Thread was not supposed to invent appetites. Want in a tower was like desire in a sword. It was what the thing had been built for. His job was to teach it hunger that did not bite the wrong throat. Vireo held the lowest rung and did not bless anything. He made the air between his hands into a cup and drew the half-dead current into it, not with a performance but with the softness of someone setting a child back into a bed they had fallen out of. He did not look at Imri. He let the tower speak first.

“You are trying to be a tree,” Imri said to it, which made Junebug snort so loudly she swallowed rain. “Trees are not ladders. They are not microphones. They do not ask for mouths. They accept birds. They make shade. They ask light in and know how to spend it. If you must be tall, be an umbrella. If you must be strong, be bored by applause.”

The tower shed a little water and remembered every flag that had been planted in its name before it drew breath. It could not be a tree. It could pretend to. It could be tall and carry stories and try not to want to own them. Imri pressed the jar’s mouth against the seam in two sections and whispered a word he had not used outside his grandmother’s kitchen. It was a word that meant enough. It was a word that meant after seconds, no more. The current that wanted to sprint up the tower felt a hand on its shoulder. It stopped. It sighed. It learned to circle.

They did not kill the tower that night. They did not even dent it. They taught it to listen to a humming that did not come from equipment. They taught it to blush when it overheard a teenager’s apology. They taught it that bars were not a moral good. They taught it to be embarrassed by its camouflage and stop trying to pass. They would have to keep teaching. It would forget. Everything does. The storm walked away on its own schedule and the lights along Broad turned back on with that shame-faced thrill lamps have when they have been out long enough to understand what it feels like to be missed.

At the hearing the next day, the vote that was not called a vote went not quite their way and not quite the company’s. The tower would stand, lower than it had asked to be, with a kink the map had not wanted to add, with a promise to paint it a color that the zinnias would hate less in July. The company men shook hands as if you had to rehearse patience and then become it. The mayor put his palm flat on Mrs. Harper’s scratch and said the words people say when they are relieved they did not have to do the scariest thing they imagined and ashamed they did not attempt it. The grammar-sign owner wrote in the corner of her bulletins in tiny red No mirrors on the tower and stuck the bulletins in places men would find them when they looked for signatures.

After, Imri and Vireo stood under the bridge where everything lived that is not impressed by meetings. The Thread, which had been holding its breath through a storm and a public process that smelled like coffee and sleep and the weird hope that comes from seeing your neighbor cry and deciding to be gentle about it, let out the long exhale of a thing that had not been asked to become a show. “You can go,” Vireo said, and his voice had become complicated in ways that made Imri think of rivers with three mouths. “To bed. To your jars. To the stupid handsome day. I will sit with this thing and if it tries to be a mirror I will tell it it has spinach in its teeth.”

“You will show it your boot print,” Imri said, and his smile was the kind a boy learns when he has learned to love someone he will never be able to explain to his mother. “You will not teach it longing. You will not teach it how to keep a secret that hurts somebody else. You will mend it if it sulks. That is your job tonight, if you want it, if you mean it.”

Vireo considered meaning the way a cat considers a lap. He looked at the tower’s shadow touch the water and he did not flinch away from the urge to make that shadow do tricks for him. He sat. He let his fine boots get wet. He did not take out a mirror. He put his hand on the concrete and told the Thread a joke so old it had fallen through three kinds of language and been rescued by women making soup. The Thread liked it. It stayed. It breathed.

Imri went home and fell into a sleep that felt legal. He dreamed of the tower that stood not like a tree but like an etiquette lesson that decided to become a birdhouse. He dreamed of Vireo’s hands empty and calm. He dreamed of Junebug putting pennies down on a clerk’s desk for fifty years and the clerk’s grandchildren being rich in some currency no bank would bother to count. He woke with the nail print on his palm and went to the bridge and set down his jars and spoke copper, bees, grandmother, enough, and then went on with the morning as if the day had always planned to be argued with and had finally been honored. The trains ran on time according to themselves and the moths died in circles because no one can convince them not to. The town stretched and did not admire itself, which was a greater victory than most parades.

Two days later, a boy came into the grammar-sign shop with a face that had tried to become a secret and failed and put his hands on the counter and said, “My father says the tower made the ball game sound like the ocean on the radio and it was like being on vacation while we lost,” and the owner, who kept receipts but not pity, handed him a red pencil because in Mooresville sometimes the right thing to give a child is the vivid authority to mark up the world as if it will listen. He went outside and underlined everything he loved and drew circles around things that required patience and made an ampersand on the sidewalk because an ampersand is the shape the town prefers when it can get away with it. Junebug clapped once under her breath and told three marbles they would get to see a circus if they sat still, and they did not, and they saw one anyway.

The tower’s first week passed without a miracle and with fewer complaints than a government would dare to hope for. Birds adjusted their routes with the brisk competence of union men. The sky did not end. A grandmother got a call from a grandson she had not heard from in too long and decided the tower was not a sin. A teenager lied to his mother with the new ease afforded by better bars, and the mother forgave him before he had finished lying because she had spent the morning at the market with peaches and had no room in her knuckles for long grief. Vireo carved nothing in the base of the fake pine. Imri checked anyway, and found no hook disguised as a fish disguised as a math problem. He did find a little chalk circle at the base that Squid had made, imperfect as a pie after the third slice, and he did not fix it.

When the carnival left, it forgot a bell, hung high in the House of Reflections where no one had looked up. The crew drove off in their exhausted trucks and the bell stayed and recovered its breath and wondered who it was supposed to sing for now. Junebug found it because she loves the act of looking where people do not and brought it down wrapped in her shirt and put it in Imri’s hands and said, “For the tower. For when it starts to admire itself too much and needs a note.” He hung it under the bridge instead, on a length of red thread, where it would ring if the Thread tensed and be quiet if it did not. Vireo laughed and did not correct him. The bell shone a little in the damp and sounded like a mother calling children home from a yard.

Late that night, in a room at the motel where the color of the carpet was either brown or regret, the young woman with boots and patience wrote in the margins of her stack of maps words that would not be filed: creek, stubborn, boy, nail, grandmother. She drew a circle by the zinnias and a circle on the bridge and she put a small star by the substation because she had not intended to love it and now she did. She turned off the lamp and lay on her back and thought that sometimes a town is the best boyfriend, because it tells you the truth in buildings. She slept with her boots by the bed like a promise. Outside, the tower did not pose and the Thread did the work it had always done dressed in new arguments and old steel. Imri’s jars hummed by the window like good gossip. Vireo dreamed of a sea where mirrors drowned and were grateful. Junebug dreamed she had learned to spell her entire name with bottle caps and woke to find she had done it and no one was surprised. The morning came with the infuriating cheer of a bird that insists upon its name, and Mooresville answered by feeding it without asking it to learn a chorus.
