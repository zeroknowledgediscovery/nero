The rain in Beaverton had a way of threading itself through your day: between the slats of afternoon, along the seams of your coat, and in the gap between one thought and the next. It moved the way dancers do, quietly, with purpose. When the rain came up Cedar Hills Boulevard that Tuesday, it brought the smell of spent tires and fir. It brought the shoosh-shoosh sound of bus doors and the gleam the pavement gets before dawn.

I had been at the clinic for nine hours and nineteen minutes when the email arrived, which meant two more patients and five more of those messages in the portal and a promise to call a pharmacy back about a refill on hydralazine. It was very early, the good kind of early that holds a pocket of silence, and I had just finished telling Mr. Ingersoll his cough sounded worse because it was worse, that lungs are not people but have feelings anyway. He had laughed and coughed and said, This is why my wife watches those dances of yours on the internet. You say a thing sideways and it makes the straight thing easier.

There is no relief quite like stepping out of the exam room and letting yourself lean your head for a heartbeat against the cool painted wall, which is a private gesture but not unprofessional because no one sees it. The email pinged. I checked it because you check everything at that hour, because it could be a lab, a cancellation. It wasn’t. Subject line: Congratulations — Finalist Notification.

For a brassy second my chest felt like someone had popped open the linchpin that holds the ribs together. Then a softer second. Then I was just there, under the dim lights, with my shoulder still against the wall and my heart in my throat like a ridiculous cartoon, reading slowly because that is how you stretch a moment.

Dear Dr. Hart and Ms. Park— The Cascade Lights Classic warmly invites you to the Final on March 26 at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. Your submission video scored in the top twelve. We encourage finalists to attend the orientation meeting on March 1. Please respond within seventy-two hours to confirm.

The remainder was logistics. The remainder had words I had desired for a year said in a voice that was somehow both bureaucratic and kind. I read it twice before I stopped leaning on the wall and went back to Mr. Ingersoll with an unprofessional lightness in my step. He noticed, because people always notice when someone they rely on suddenly seems taller by an inch.

“You get good news,” he asked, stirring in his chair, that lavender cardigan sliding over the slope of his shoulders.

“I got news from the dance competition. My partner and I made the final.”

He gave a low whistle. “You’re a doctor and a dancer. Is there nothing you will not do?”

“Plenty,” I said, smiling. “I won’t fix the printer again. I won’t pretend my signature looks better than a frog. But yes. I’ll dance.”

“It will be on television?”

“Livestream, I think,” I said, and felt myself blush in the way you blush when the thing you love is pulled into light. “Do you need anything else before you go? We’ll start the steroid taper and the inhaler I mentioned.”

He waved me off with a theatrical hand. “Go write down your joy before you misplace it. You doctors put it in a drawer and forget.”

I nodded like I would, but I wrote his steroid schedule first and printed it, handed it to him, listened to the rustle as he folded it into his cardigan pocket. On my way to the nurse’s station, I made a passable attempt at a chassé down the hall. Leah, who has been here longer than the hall has had paint, glanced up at exactly the right moment and caught me.

“No running,” she said placidly. “No waltzing. No hip checks. And for God’s sake answer your portal messages.”

“We made the final,” I said, not bothering to pretend to be cool. “Me and Elise. We got in.”

Leah raised her eyebrows in a way that means she was actually excited. “No kidding. The Cascade Lights one you watch on your phone during lunch? The one with sparkles and judges who speak in metaphor like they swallowed a poetry book?”

“The very one.”

She allowed herself a short smile, then turned back to the computer because joy is like that here; you put it on a plate and then keep moving. “Well. That’s big. I’ll expect autographs. You can sign mine ‘Leah, who told him to stop over-rotating sooner than anyone else.’ Now go see room three before they write a Yelp review complaining your hair looks too happy.”

I went through the rest of clinic with a steady hum under everything, the steady hum that had been there since August, when Elise texted me from the studio with a link and the words, We should. You in? She is like that. She moves quickly toward the things that scare her because moving slowly is worse. I said yes and we started a routine in a studio with scuffed wooden floors and a ceiling that was too low on one side. We filmed in November; we sent it. We said we did not care about the outcome. But of course we did.

Late in the morning I sat at the computer between a blood pressure recheck and a sinus infection and wrote Elise: EMAIL. WE ARE IN. I added a confession: I forgot how to breathe for twenty seconds.

She responded with a burst of fireworks and a voice message I listened to three times, then played for the nurses, because joy can multiply when seen. “Ro! We made it. We made it. Oh my— Okay. Okay. Okay. I’m at school until three-thirty, the kids are feral with book reports, but after that I can meet. Studio or your garage? I vote studio because the floor loves us and Roz has opinions. Also I think the mouse ate my shoe. Long story.”

I texted back: The mouse?

Her reply came with a photo of a toe of her practice shoe, satin shredded, the delicate ribbon gnawed. In the background I could see one of the studio mirrors, the busted corner taped with painter’s tape and a scribble that said, in all caps, THIS IS TEMPORARY. She wrote, It was probably a raccoon, right? Or the ghost of a cobbler? Or a mouse with a grudge. Anyway I’ll bring my other pair.

Between lunch and the late afternoon surge, I called my mother. She lives in Eugene, the way people do, snug among the hazelnuts and the thrift stores, not retired so much as sideways to work. She answered on the third ring because she has always liked odd numbers.

“Sweetheart,” she said. “I was thinking of you. No, I was thinking of tea, and then I thought of the tea you like, the bergamot that tastes like winter coats, and then I thought there you are, and then the phone rang, and so there we are.”

“Mom,” I said, because the first sound matters and it’s a tether. “We made the final. Elise and I. The big one in Portland.”

She gasped in a small, exact way. “Well. That’s very lovely. That’s— Rowan, is this the one you showed me that had that man in the silver pants nearly break his hip? The Paso with the chair?”

“That’s the one.”

“And when is it?”

“End of March. Orientation on the first.”

“Your schedule.”

“Complicated,” I said, and rubbed my forehead where the headache of the day had taken a sublet. “The clinic’s already posted Easter staffing. But Leah will switch, and I can make up the shift. It will be fine.”

She made the humming noise she uses both to agree and to disagree. It means, I trust you, but please do not fall down. “If your father were alive,” she said, and then stopped herself. When she started again her voice was light. “He would say, ‘Rowan, break a leg but not the tibia because that heals as slow as bureaucracy.’ He would bring a posterboard. He would mishandle glitter.”

“God help us,” I said, laughing. “He would.”

“You will tell me what to wear. You will tell me when to clap. I am already anxious about the voting. I do not like voting. It makes me wonder if my friends will vote wrong.”

“I’ll tell you everything. It’s a judged final. No fan voting.”

“Oh good,” she breathed. “Experts. Then you will be judged by poets. That is better.”

By the time I left the clinic, the rain had steadied into the kind of rain that is not an event but a mood. The MAX train banged along the line by the mall. I drove over to Fir Grove Dance, an old warehouse on a side street that seems like it should be spelled sienna with an S but isn’t. The sign is new and the door is old; the lock sometimes sticks; the floor remembers your bad days.

Inside, warm. Roz was at the front desk counting a pile of wristbands, the ones we use for charity nights and for the all-ages salsa socials when the teenagers come in giggling and emerging as small, fierce adults. Roz is short, strong, has hair that is either pink or lavender depending on her mood and the weather, and knows everything about everyone. She smokes sometimes in the alley even though she says she doesn’t. She has romper suits she calls jumpsuits so we all call them jumpsuits. She looked up without looking up.

“Well well, if it isn’t the tall doctor from Beaverton with the good shoes. I saw the email. Elise called me from the parking lot and screamed into my ear. I can’t hear out of one side now, thank you both. Congratulations. Try not to faint.”

I grinned and leaned across the counter. “I think I already did. Roz, orientation’s on the first. Do you have the card reader working now? I still owe for last week.”

She waved a hand like I was a child trying to pay for my own popsicle. “We’ll settle. You ought to know, Tomas is in one of his moods. He says the tango died last year and he’s the only one who knows the funeral date. So be gentle.”

Tomas is sixty and possibly from Zagreb but maybe from Ohio; he will not commit. He has the carriage of a soldier and the eyes of someone who has seen things that the rest of us should not. He teaches with a dryness that is affectionate. If you step on his toe, he lifts his head and says, My toe forgives you. My soul does not. Today he wore a scarf that had purple swirls and a T-shirt that said, In This House We Pivot.

He glanced up as I walked in. “Doctor,” he said. “How is the asthma of the man with the cardigan?”

“He’s on a steroid taper,” I said. “Budesonide twice a day. You look nice too.”

He shrugged, pleased. “You made the final. Good. It is time for you to stop under-rotating. You under-rotate everything in life. It is charming and small. We will make you big.”

“I like charming and small.”

“Elise likes winning,” he said, and I laughed because he wasn’t wrong.

Elise arrived at 4:14 in sneakers and a messy bun and carrying a tote bag with a cartoon of a fox reading a book on it. She works as a school counselor at the magnet school near the stream and can talk to teenagers without dying. Her cheeks were pink with the long hallway of the day; she smelled like paper and tea and the ersatz citrus of school soap.

“We are finalists,” she sang, dropping her tote and sliding into me with the careful exactness of a person who has learned how to stand close to someone without scaring them. “We are finalists. Why are you breathing like a hunted deer?”

“I told too many people and now it exists,” I said. “Also I listened to your voice message eight times.”

“Flattery will get you a practice room,” Roz said, tossing us the key. “Studio B, the floor’s not sticky anymore. Mouse situation is ongoing.”

“Wait,” I said, picking up my bag. “There is a mouse situation? Elise said the mouse ate her shoe. That sounded like a metaphor.”

Roz made a face. “Truth, love. Cute little monster with opinions. Lives under the vending machine. It glares. Hector sent an email to the landlord. Pest control comes Thursday. In the meantime, do not leave your snacks unattended or your expensive satin. I put down humane traps but Hector stepped in one with his boot and made a speech, so now we have contracts and clipboards. If you see it, clap and shout and it will run away. Or it will laugh at you. I can’t tell.”

I tried to imagine a mouse that laughs. I pictured it crossing its small arms and tapping a foot, disapproving. A mouse with a grudge. I felt the oddest flash of identification, as if I had been small and angry and under a machine once. Then Elise reached for my hand, because we do that habitually when our minds wander in opposite directions, and we went into Studio B.

We started with a slow tango drill, the kind whose result is the difference between being good and being interesting. Tomas watched like a hawk whose eyes are tired. He let us warm up in quiet. There are words you do not say at first because words assert and what we needed was permission, so we used our feet to make sense of it. Elise’s frame set; mine lifted; our hold found the place that is firm but not a prison. The first step into the promenade made my body swallow air with that greedy joy again.

“You see,” Tomas said at last, walking around us like we were a sculpture. “Already better. You are both taller today. You are taller because joy takes up space. Do not apologize. The music will not apologize for you.”

He put on something lush and slightly unhinged, a tango with strings like a storm. We moved. The routine is ours, a thing we built with the slow relentless movement of winter. It has a close we added last week, a quiet stillness after a run of quicks, our heads turned away at the same angle so our breath halos in the mirror. For months we have fit each piece like a carpenter, shaving corners. Now we wear it like clothes you forget you have on.

“Again,” Tomas said when we finished. “Quicker into the Corte. Less forgiveness in the knees. Elise you are fierce. Rowan you are very nice and I want you to be less nice. It is tango. Nice will be murdered in a tango alley.”

“I can do murder,” I said, breathless and sweating and not minding it.

“You can,” he said softly. “You don’t believe it, but you can.”

We drilled for an hour and a half, with small water breaks and a five-minute interlude in which Elise told me a story about a ninth grader who brought a ferret in a backpack to school for emotional support. I told her about Mr. Ingersoll’s cardigan and the portal message that said, in all seriousness, Doctor can you write a note that I am allergic to my boss. We practiced our Viennese Waltz section until I saw stars. We ended with a heel turn that is the kind of turn that takes your back teeth as collateral.

When we were done, we folded ourselves onto the floor like paper. We lay there and let the wood press up into our spines and lungs, and our breathing slowed, and the studio settled, and I heard it. Two small sounds. A faint scratching. The whisper of a creature that knows it is watched.

I lifted my head. Under the vending machine, which Roz had gaffered to the wall with a bungee cord for a reason I did not wholly understand, two eyes glowed darkly. They were not shiny, just confident. A tiny nose jetted out, whiskers tasting the air. The mouse was not scared. The mouse was interested. I had never before felt like prey to something so small. It was, absurdly, angrier than it needed to be.

Elise rolled onto an elbow. “There,” she whispered. “The goblin. That’s what Mr. Kim’s kid called it. The Goblin.”

“Hello,” I said, because medicine teaches you that greeting the thing is better than pretending it is not there. “We will not be leaving snacks.”

The mouse’s whiskers shivered, either in derision or in a draft. It withdrew half a centimeter and then came back out again, bolder. Its ears twitched. It shot off along the baseboard, an arrow of fur and decision, toward Studio A.

“Bold,” Elise said. “Tiny tyrant.”

“We’ll tell Roz,” I said, standing and tugging at the hem of my shirt. “She’ll add it to her list.”

Out in the hall, Roz already knew. She always knows. “I could hear the audacity from here,” she said, scribbling something with a marker that was running dry. “Tomorrow I’m putting the good trap. But Hector will have a fit. He thinks we should build it a little house and charge extra for mouse therapy.”

Tomas, who had been pretending to do math on his phone, looked up. “Mice are only a problem when they forget their place,” he said. “They forget and then they take. Humans are the same. Do not forget your place. It is onstage.”

Elise leaned against me, air-limp and smiling. “Again tomorrow?”

“Again tomorrow,” I said. “Clinic in the morning. Zach has me at two. I can be here by four.”

“Good,” she said. “Good, good, good.”

At home, the garage held what garages hold: bikes with soft tires, eight boxes of the life before this one, a set of free weights that made me feel guilty when I walked past. I have one of those floors you can roll out, thin as conscience. The ceiling is low enough that a lift feels monumental. I put on music and did an hour of his never-finished, never-started solo drills. Outside, the rain made a sound like pages turning.

In the middle of that, my phone rang with a private number. I let it go to voicemail. It rang again. I answered with the breathless patience of a man in a plank.

“Dr. Hart,” said a woman’s voice, and then, gently, “It’s Emme from scheduling. You told me to call if there were holes in the afternoon tomorrow.”

I stood, pressing the phone between ear and shoulder. “Hi, Emme. What did we lose?”

“Dr. Khan’s kid has a fever. She’s taking him in. Can you cover one to five? I know it’s not ideal. I’ll call Laurie in family med but I think they’re slammed. You can have Thursday afternoon off instead. Please say yes. I will bring cookies with the good salt.”

I pictured my training time collapsing and then reassembling like birds when they get spooked and then come back. “Yes,” I said. “Of course. Tell Khan I hope the fever breaks. I’ll push my workout. Tell me you’re lying about cookies so I won’t expect them.”

“I never lie about baked goods,” Emme said. “You’re a prince. Or at least a duke. See you.”

After we hung up, I stared at the garage in the unromantic light of the single bulb. I felt it then, the pressure. The competition was not going to make the clinic go away. The clinic was not going to excuse the competition. This is the place I live, between, a thin plank between two stories, arms burning, trying to be both patient with myself and impossible. It’s an ordinary story, no better or worse than the one that belongs to the nurse whose kid needs school supplies or the teacher who works a second job at the grocery store. It is ordinary and it is mine.

I texted Elise. The schedule. Her reply was immediate because she reads my mind and my calendar. We can move it. I’ll talk to Roz. I’ll bribe Tomas with soup. We will be flexible like the thing I cannot think of because I am hungry. Eat something.

I ate something. I showered. I stared at the ceiling and thought of the stage, not the studio with the warm scuffed floor but the sharp clean open mouth of the stage that is waiting at the Schnitz in late March. The first time I saw a performance there I was eight. A touring company of some Broadway thing with a big staircase and a lot of hats and one song about the sun. I remember the feeling of the orchestra lights coming up, the inside of my chest doing what it did this morning. Somebody somewhere said, quiet please, and then it began.

That night I dreamed about it, the stage, but it wasn’t the onstage part. It was the part under and behind. Cords and coils. Tapes on the floor that meant don’t die. It was the way big old buildings breathe when the heating system changes its mind. It was the mouse of the studio, somehow there, sitting on a coil of cable and chewing with a solemn concentration. In the dream, someone said, He has a job. Later I woke and lay in the dark, listening to a different silence, the kind apartments keep, and heard nothing at all but my own breath and the rain that does not ask.

The next day collapsed and elongated, like all good days. At noon Leah slid me a peanut butter sandwich and said, “Eat while charting so you can use your lunch to go outside and remember the sky.” I followed orders. At twelve forty-eight a woman cried. At one thirty-five a kid let me listen to the sound of his valve through his shirt because he believes doctors are like detectives and I wanted to be worthy of it. At one fifty-five Emme leaned in and mouthed the word cookies and I mouthed back liar and she mouthed back never. At two fifteen the portal chirped. It is strange to live in a world where people can request a letter saying our clinic does not allow dogs unless they are trained and also ask you whether it is safe to travel to Spain if you are allergic to cats.

At four exactly I was in the car, at four nineteen I was in Studio B, at four twenty I was in Elise’s arms. There is a space that you inhabit when you dance with someone for months, a geography like a tight map. You know the sound their shoes make when they are tired. You know their laugh after a heel slip. You know what they will do when the music stutters. We ran the routine without music once, then with, then again.

On the third run, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I looked down without thinking, the way you are not supposed to do and do anyway. It was a message from a blocked number: Finally. a stage that suits the ego. Meet your match. The punctuation was wrong. The capitalization was wrong. The bones of the message were wrong. I stared at it, a small unease threading through the high of our work.

“Spam?” Elise asked, leaning sweaty shoulder to sweaty shoulder, catching her breath.

“Probably,” I said. “Somebody selling knives. Or votives. I’ll block it.”

“You should get off the internet,” she said, and then Tomas shouted, “Do not flirt with your telephones; flirt with each other,” and we both laughed.

After practice we huddled in the corner with Roz’s tour of the new schedule. She was agitated in the way she gets when she has too many moving pieces and not enough tape. “Sebastian sent an email,” she said, as if dropping a diagnosis. “He wants to rent Studio A four mornings a week until the final. He says he’s in the running and needs room. I told him to go to the community center and do it under the portrait of the mayor. He said he would pay double.”

Elise’s eyebrows went up. “Sebastian Ames? The one with the jawline and the manbun? He makes those Instagram videos where he pretends to be indifferent to applause and then looks directly into the camera like he invented applause.”

“He’s good,” Roz said, reluctantly. “He is fancy. He brings women who look like expensive soap. You two are nicer humans and you work harder. I do not want him to win. But he will rent Tuesday mornings so I will allow him to try.”

It is late to introduce an antagonist and yet here he was, striding through my mind in slow motion, hair perfect, teeth like a threat. I brushed it off. Competition is fine. It is a thing between your brain and your work and the stage. The rest is noise. Elise pressed a hand to my chest, just there, a permission. “We’ve got this,” she said. “Rivals are like coffee. Useful in small quantities. Terrible at midnight.”

We did not see the mouse that night. I went home with aching toes and the lightness joy lends you when work and luck align. Later, standing on my balcony with a mug of too-hot tea, I tried to resist the part of me that wants to see the future like a spreadsheet, clean boxes, selecting the right handful of steps and telling a patient there is no debt incurred on the heart. It does not work that way. It is messy like rain.

When orientation came on March 1, the sky over Portland was a bright, flat blue that felt like a favor. Elise wore a dress she called her meeting dress because it has a collar that makes adults in ties feel at ease. I wore a blazer I had had since residency because it has the smell of dissection and fear removed by time. We walked in through the front doors like people who have tickets to the inside of a machine and were greeted by a volunteer so enthusiastic I suspected choreography.

Inside, the ballroom part of the hall was full of folding chairs. Onstage, where we will be, there were tape marks and a man named Ed who runs such things standing with his hands in his pockets. “Welcome to the Cascade Lights Classic,” he said into a microphone that did not need a microphone. “We are so happy to have you here. Some of you have been here before. Some of you have not. Some of you will pretend to be nonchalant and fail and that is fine. This is a good place. You are safe. Do not die. Do not bleed too much. Do not be cruel to the volunteers. Everything else can be fixed.”

We watched a slideshow about the stage dimensions and the rules about lifts and how to exit and what to do if you lose a shoe. We were given badges. We were handed maps. We stood on the stage and did our own silent run, feet sketching the steps, when the room was empty. The echo was different than the studio. It made us taller. It made the edges of the routine show, hide, reveal again.

On our way out, just past the stage door, I saw it. A small sign, stenciled, that said in block letters PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE ANIMALS and then, smaller, (We have a mouse who lives somewhere in the under-hall. He is temperamental. He will steal from the unguarded.) I pointed it out to Elise because sometimes the world gives you a private joke and you have to share it before it evaporates. She looked and snorted a laugh. “They always do. They always have one. A theater mouse. With opinions.”

“We will not feed him,” I said, and as I said it, a young stagehand in a hoodie with a coffee mug passed us, humming. He glanced at the sign with affection. “He’s been here for years,” the kid said. “We call him Captain. He gets mad if you move gaffer tape without permission.”

“Does he,” Elise said, doing that thing where she nods to keep from laughing.

“I’m serious,” the stagehand said, not offended. “He’s bitten one of the violinists. It’s a whole thing.”

I said what you say when the world gives you a stagehand who believes in a mouse. “We’ll be careful.”

It became a story by the time we were in the car and a myth by the time we were back at the studio. Roz made the sign of the cross with two pens. Tomas rolled his eyes and then knocked on the floor three times. Leah texted me a picture of a mouse in a lab coat she had printed from the internet. We laughed and kept going. It was March, which is a brittle month here. Sometimes the sun comes up like a cymbal and then the hail comes in around three. I hunkered into the rhythm I know, the one where you jump from one world to the other without looking down, trusting the boards.

There are moments you can see from a distance and there are moments you don’t. There was a night, mid-March, when we practiced two hours too long and Tomas said go home before you ruin it. There was a morning I met with a patient who hung his head and said, it is too late, and I said, it isn’t, and I believed myself with a ferocity that made my throat ache. There was a phone call from my mother that lasted exactly the length of her tea, and she said, plainly, I am proud of you, and the sentence laid down in my chest like beams.

And there was a Wednesday when I found a small, angry, precise pile of sunflower seed shells in my dance bag, even though I had not eaten sunflower seeds in a year.

I looked at the shells, at their neat pile, at the tiny shape of the tooth marks. I looked around the studio, unconsciously gentle, as if the culprit would be offended to be caught. Then I tightened the zip on the bag and told Elise and she howled. Roz put her head on the counter and beat it twice very softly. Tomas said, in his driest voice, “You are marked.”

It felt like a prank, the kind somebody plays when they like you. It felt like an omen, the kind you ignore until the day it matters. Both can be true. Everything is always two things at once. Sometimes three.

On the nineteenth of March the cherry trees that make the parking lots bearable came out like a party thrown by someone you love. Elise and I rehearsed the entrance three times, then the exit three times. We argued about the tilt in the second chorus, the small angle of our heads at the end of the run. We argued politely and then impolitely and then made up with a gelato from the truck on the corner. We stood under the pink trees and put both our heads on one shoulder because the photographers from the little lifestyle magazine asked us to and it seemed funny. Then we went back inside and danced again, because that is the only thing that makes anything quieter.

Sebastian appeared that same week, as advertised, in Studio A with a partner whose hair was a field of gold and whose mouth was unsmiling even when she smiled. He was what he was. He was undeniably good. He was controlled without being cold, and his footwork was precise in a way that made you a little mad and a little inspired. He nodded when he passed us, a nod that could be read as hello or sorry, your day will not come.

“Let him be a sledgehammer,” Elise said, while we did our quiet slow promenade. “We will be a violin. It’ll be fine.”

“Violins can be violent,” I said, and smiled because I liked myself better when I let myself think like that.

The week before the final, the clinic became a storm and the studio became a nest. In the mornings, gallbladders and fear and allergies to cats. At night, turns on turns on turns. I fell asleep one night with my shoes on and woke with the imprint of the laces on my ankle. The mouse came and went, leaving fewer messages and more presences. I saw him twice more, a scuttle, a regard. He looked exactly like himself. He looked like something small and furious in a world too big and bright.

On Thursday, Elise came in with a bandage just under her knee. “Basketball at lunchtime,” she said, an apology hanging on her like a coat. “I forgot that children fling themselves headlong at happiness. I will be okay. I am twenty-two inside.”

“You are twenty-two inside,” I said. “Inside I am eighty-four and deeply skeptical of microwaves. We will go easy today.”

We did not go easy. We did what you do when you are close to a thing and it is close to you. We ran and ran and then we stood still with our hands held and listened to our breath. Tomas watched us and nodded once. “Now,” he said. “Now it is almost right. Now it is you.”

That night it hailed and the next morning it was eighty degrees. Portland throws the weather like confetti. My mother texted me a photograph of her suitcase with the caption: Does one bring flour? I think not. I told her to bring earrings instead. Leah brought me a silver clip in the shape of a star and said, I wore this when I sang karaoke and died. It is yours now. You will die and also not. Emme left a sealed box of cookies on my desk that said, In Case of Emergency, With Salt. I did not open it. I wanted a ritual.

The angry mouse was surely somewhere doing what angry mice do when spring arrives. He had his own program. He had his own stage. He had his cords and his tapes and his coils and someone he taught to be scared of what he could do when he was small and determined. He had no idea what he would do to me. Or perhaps he did. Perhaps he had been planning. Perhaps we had all been planning, which is to say, we had been building the moment that would ask us to become larger than what we were, even if only by an inch.

On Saturday morning, Elise texted me: Up? and I wrote back: Up. She wrote: Coffee? I wrote: Always. She wrote: Come soon. It’s quiet here. The floor is ours. And for a moment I sat at the edge of my bed and looked at the window and thought, which life is this. Then I stood and put my weight into both feet. I stood and thought of the inside of a concert hall, of a man named Ed saying do not bleed too much; of a sign that said Do Not Feed the Animals; of a small creature with a temper; of a chair in a clinic where a man in a lavender cardigan told me to write down my joy before I misplace it. I stood and thought, I will try. Then I went to dance.Chapter 3

The studio at nine on a Saturday has a quiet the weekday never offers, a hush that sits on the barre and watches you lace your shoes and asks very little in return. Roz had left the front lights on low and the door cracked in a way that meant, if you are early, you can pretend I meant to let you in. Elise arrived with two coffees that smelled like we had done something right. We stood in the hall and sipped them like contraband, paper cups warm in the small space between us, the silence of a city that had not yet made up its mind. Inside, the floor received us with the politeness of old friends who will call you on your nonsense if you try to pull it.

We started with basics because basics are the only religion that has ever saved me. Weight over heels. Inside edge of the standing foot. Spine lifted from the back of the neck so you can breathe even when everything else is a set of square corners. I like drills for the way they turn your brain down from a shout to a murmur. Elise likes drills because they are the path to a thing that can survive light. Tomas stood in the doorway with a cup the color of tar and watched us do our little meditations with an expression that meant he approved and did not want us to know it. When we had burned through the first song, he stepped in and rearranged my elbow half an inch, as if tuning a violin. Half an inch was a better person.

“Today we make choices,” he said, setting his cup on the piano and wiping his hands on a towel that used to be white. “Today we decide which flaws we will keep and call character. Today we accept that you cannot fix everything in the time you have and you should not try or you will look like a man who brought a toolbox to a wedding.”

“I have brought a toolbox to a wedding,” I said, making my face appropriately contrite. “Basement light. Long story. Terrible vows but good electrician work.”

Elise snorted and bumped her hip against mine. “Let’s put the run at tempo,” she said. “Start in the walk so my head remembers we have a head.”

We ran it two, three, four times, with Tomas’s little interjections dropped like postcards. Less forgiveness in the Q-Q-S. More arrogance in the promenade. Stop apologizing with the eyes; you are not here to make them comfortable. My body was a small country that morning and I liked my chances. Elise’s left shoulder, which will always try to steal from the right if you let it, behaved with near saintliness. The heel turn that had made me see God and then bargain with him last week arrived and placed itself where planned. When we finished the fourth run we both laughed, not from superiority but from relief, like people who have been allowed to keep something.

Roz knocked the doorframe with her knuckles and came in rubbing the corner of her eye with her wrist. Her eyeliner was copper, which meant she had woken up feeling generous. “Before you get too pleased with yourselves,” she said, which in Roz’s mouth is an affirmation, “remember the sewer outside is backing up and Hector is going to cry about it and the city says Monday. Also, there were sunflower shells under the vending machine again. The angry prince feasts. I put down the humane trap with peanut butter because Hector is a bleeding heart and I am a little too.”

“Does peanut butter count as feeding the animals,” I asked, thinking of the sign in the Schnitz, and the stagehand’s earnest face, and the way the rodent world seems to run parallel to ours like a tiny war.

“Peanut butter is an apology we make to ourselves,” Roz said. “Also, pest control Thursday turned into pest control who will call me back. So clap at your friend if you see him and please do not let him chew your costume. That silk is a mortgage.”

We practiced an hour more and then put it down on purpose, because Tomas knows something about us that I have only recently admitted, which is that my desire to solve is a drug I cannot manage alone. He made us stretch with the lights off and the music low and the door cracked for air. He talked about walking onstage like it was a kitchen you know, not a god’s mouth. He told me if I remembered to breathe in the second chorus I would stop trying to fix things that were not broken and start offering something that was.

Between one song and the next, my phone buzzed with a text. It lit my pocket the way lightning lights a corner of a room you were pretending was small. I took it out and looked because I have not yet become the person who can delay a possible emergency for art. The number was blocked. The message said, in that same wrong grammar, Ever think the floor likes someone else. Try not to slip when the music gets real. I stared at it until the words detached from sense and became blocky shapes. Elise saw my face and reached out in that mechanical way we now have, her hand finding my wrist like she had been there seconds earlier. I showed her and watched her frown reach back toward her hairline.

“You gonna block it,” she asked, not pleased, not panicked, the way you ask if someone is going to wash their hands before cooking. “Or forward it to Roz so she can mutter in Italian and slash tires.”

“Blocking feels like a game,” I said, throat tight. “Forwarding feels like a bigger game. We could tell Ed when we get to the Schnitz for the tech. He likes rules. He eats them for breakfast with bran.”

“Tell Ed,” she said. “Tell Ed and tell Roz and do not tell anyone else because we will starve the drama. And then we will dance better than whoever writes like a middle school hallway.”

We did both of those things. Ed read the message without moving his eyebrows and said, “We have security. If there is a person, they will have a badge or they will have a problem. If there is a phone, it can be put in a bag. Leave this on the floor and do not pick it up.” He had his hands in his pockets in that way stage people do to keep from touching hands with other stage people. We stood on the stage again with the lights up to day and the auditorium empty. There is something indecent about an empty theater; it lets you see its ribs. The stage had an imperceptible away tilt that made my calves talk to me in long sentences. The edge was farther than I thought; the back was closer. Elise and I marked the entrances and the exits and the breath. I watched her walk to where our finish will happen and line her body up with the sight lines and close her eyes. I watched the way she stacked herself like a person solving calculus on an inhale.

Back at the clinic, I wrote a medication change for a woman whose migraines had ruined three jobs and made a fourth. The new medication had side effects she had read about on the internet and we talked about risk and about a life she could put her hands on and about the way we sometimes over-identify with the worst thing we have heard. She had a scar under her ear that she touched when she was thinking. By the time she left, we had a plan and a follow-up and a promise that if she called at night someone would call back. I ate half of an apple Leah left on my desk and a thing in a wrapper that claimed to be a cookie and failed so nobly I wanted to give it a medal. I put the blocked number on a list of things for my brain to carry in a pocket and sat on my hands so I would not check it again every nine minutes.

Mr. Ingersoll came for his follow-up in his lavender cardigan and announced he had already written down his joy and it was on the fridge next to the picture his wife had put up of a house in Arizona that did not belong to them and never would. His lungs sounded better. He told me he had watched videos of the competition from three years ago and had opinions about a couple that broke hold too early, and I told him about hold rules the way you tell a neighbor how the HOA works even though you wish we lived in a place without an HOA. He made me promise to text his daughter a link to the livestream when it existed. He made me say it twice. I put it in my calendar as if I could trust myself later to remember anything but breath and count.

Two days before the final, Sebastian decided to be human. Or he decided to play a man who had something like humanity available. He approached us while we were sliding our feet into our shoes and said, in that perfect public voice he keeps in a jar, “Break a leg, you two. I’ve heard nice things.” His partner, whose name I kept losing and finding again, nodded once like a bell. Sebastian’s hair was pulled back with aesthetic mathematics. When he turned to leave, the air smelled like grapefruit and the inside of a car that cost more than college.

“You want to say something poisonous,” Elise murmured, amused. “Don’t. It will come back to haunt your feet.”

“I was going to say, your man bun looks expensive,” I said, tying my laces. “I was going to say, is it insured.”

“Even that is too spicy,” she said, pressing the knot with the pad of one finger. “We will be generous in small ways so when we are vicious on stage it’s clean.”

After he left, I pulled my bag open to grab the towel I had been using and found, again, precise little shells, a small pyramid of them, placed on top of my knee sleeve like a note. I sat for a second with my hand on the zipper, trying, and failing, to find the line between annoyed and delighted. This time, under the shells, there was a long fragile thread of something that had once been ribbon and now was plan. It had been gnawed at the edge, tiny bites. It was not mine. It was not Elise’s. Roz arrived like an omen and put her hands on her hips when she saw my face.

“You are being courted by the goblin,” she said, not faking dismay. “He brings gifts. Today ribbon, tomorrow a ring made of gaffer tape. Do not marry the mouse, Rowan, it ends badly.”

“What if it’s not the mouse,” I said, before I could stop myself. “What if it’s a person who thinks I will enjoy the way my shoes are a metaphor.”

“Then you will not marry the person,” she said, hand already out for the shells. “And I will put these in the jar with the paper clips and curse them every time I have to find a staple.”

She tapped Tomas on the shoulder and showed him the ribbon. He looked at it and then at me in the mirror. “Superstition is a rehearsal for grief,” he said, not unkind. “Keep your bag on a chair. Keep your head on your work. Do not give your fear a name that makes it a friend.”

That night in the garage, my brain would not simmer. It over-boiled and made a mess on the range. I attempted to quiet it with heel leads and body flight and failed. I put on music meant for sleeping and lay on the mat and did a variety of unpleasant core exercises until my stomach trembled and I felt virtuous enough to attempt nothingness. The phone was face down across the room and I stared at it from the floor with the intensity of a cat. When I stood up to shower, it buzzed once. I did not look at it for three minutes. When I did, the message said, New laces at the Schnitz are not a bad idea. Floors are hungry. It was from a different number with the same punctuation sin. I pressed my thumb between my eyes until stars.

I texted Elise and she wrote back immediately, which is her gift. We’re telling Ed. We’re telling Roz. We’re telling nobody else. Then we are buying two sets of laces and a roll of tape and pretending we are camping. Bring an apple. Bring your mom’s voice. Bring nothing more complicated than water. I love her for saying bring your mom’s voice and meaning it.

My mother arrived the day before, wearing earrings the color of old coins and carrying a tote full of snacks she would try to press on backstage volunteers. She hugged me with the one-armed squeeze that let me keep my hands for carrying things and then looked at my face as if counting it for parts. She put her hand on my cheek. She said, in a voice that did not belong to anyone but her, “You are holding too many ends. Tie two and let the others be strings. They will not choke you if you do not wind them around your neck.”

“You have always been poetic about strangulation,” I said, and she laughed and hit me, softly, with the tote.

We went to the theater that afternoon for the last tech and the first dress. Ed’s hand was in his pocket and there was a headset on his head like a crown. He pressed it absently as he talked to a person I could not see. He walked us to the dressing rooms and pointed out the vent that made the room cold on the left and the heater that made the room hot on the right. He told us who our backstage volunteer would be. He introduced us to both of his stage managers and the electrician who would fix a thing you did not know was broken because he had already fixed it. Everyone looked like someone you would want nearby if your car broke down or your heart did.

The backstage smelled like gaffer and dust and the faintest breath of someone else’s cologne. There were flowers on a table with a sign that said DO NOT LEAVE THESE HERE and a basket with safety pins and a vial of clear nail polish and three coils of wire that I have never figured out what anyone uses for but always find reassuring. Someone had posted a handwritten note that said THE MOUSE IS A CRUSTY OLD MAN; IF YOU RESPECT HIM HE WILL RESPECT YOU. Under it, someone had added, in smaller letters, EXCEPT WHEN HE DOESN’T.

I taped the inside of my shoes because I am a man who listens to omens even while trying not to. I checked my laces and put the spare set in Elise’s bag because when I lose things I prefer to lose them twice rather than once. Elise did her hair in a way that made her look like herself if herself had a stage. She clipped Leah’s star into the back and then unclipped it and clipped it again with more care. She gave me a look in the mirror that said, gently, Don’t go somewhere I cannot follow. I gave her one that said, I won’t, but if I do, pull.

When we stepped onstage for the last light check, I felt the shape of the room like a hand at my back. The sound of the empty was taller than any sound. The light found us in that honest way light has when it is not being romantic. The tape marks we had memorized looked smaller under the glow. Ed nodded from the wings and the light operator bumped us slightly warmer, slightly less like salt. We ran the first section and I fought with my mouth about smiling and my mouth won. The floor was smoother than the studio, slipperier, more like a promise than a grip.

In the second run, Sebastian took an unremarkable fall and made it interesting by standing up beautifully. His partner rescued three bobby pins from the stage and put them between her teeth like a magician. No one made a noise about it. The professionals moved around the small crisis like it was furniture you expect in a familiar house. Later, near the wings, he caught my eye and shrugged without self-pity. “It happens,” he said, a human thing, a good thing. “The floor and I are in a long marriage. We argue. She wins.”

Outside, the weather held its breath. Inside, the air moved because there were so many of us breathing. I left my bag on a chair as Tomas had instructed and looped my jacket over the back in a proprietary way. In the hallway, a violinist tuned like a person trying not to cry. A volunteer named Marta with a name tag that had tassels told us where to line up. She had the voice of an aunt who got things done. She handed us both a safety pin “for luck” and then pretended not to care when we took them like talismans. Roz whispered in my ear that no one had seen the mouse in the under-hall for three days and she did not like new quiet.

The night before is worse than the day of because the night is a theater too and this one has fewer lights and no Ed. I went home and ate pasta because I have faith in carbohydrates I do not place in doctrines. I showered and put on socks and then took them off because my feet were hot with a hum that was not entirely mine. I stood on my balcony and looked at the dark with the patience of a person waiting for a kettle to boil. My phone rested face down and I made a ceremony of leaving it that way. My mother read in the corner chair I had never figured out how to sit in properly and asked, without looking up, “What song will you use to slow your blood before you step out,” and I said, “The one with the strings we did drills to,” and she said, “Good, because if you do that one with the sparklers I will disown you.”

I slept and woke and slept and woke like the ocean. I dreamed of the stairs at the back of the Schnitz that lead to the place where people smoke and tell each other secrets they will forget. I dreamed of Ed saying, as if from far away, The line is the line is the line. I dreamed of my father’s laugh and my mother’s hands and the little shells in a very small neat pile on a surface you should not have been able to see under the light of a single emergency bulb. I woke at four and watched the ceiling for a long time, counting it into peace with a method Leah taught me that works better for children and worked adequately for me.

On the morning, I went to clinic for two hours because anxiety is a form of fuel and so are forms. I saw a walk-in ear infection that I could help in exactly ten minutes and left a voicemail for a cardiologist asking for an earlier appointment for someone who would not ask for themselves. Leah gave me a bag with a ribbon on it that contained something wrapped in tissue that I knew was edible and would open later like a superstitious animal. Emme hugged me in a way that would not change my posture and whispered, “I’m not bringing cookies today but after, I am bringing cake,” and I wanted to cry for reasons that did not include cake. Mr. Ingersoll did not come in but he called the nurse line and left a message saying, tell him break a leg but not the tibia, and I wrote it on my hand with a pen I do not normally permit and that made me feel twelve in the best way.

Backstage at call, the hallway had become a river. People flowed. People eddied. People said hello and smiled with their front teeth and fixed their hair while talking about parking. Ed walked through calmly like a man crossing a street where cars yield because they love him. He said, to everyone and no one, “Mic check, light check, breath check,” and Marta clapped like a camp counselor and said, “Water is behind the black,” and I thought about how institutions survive on people like Marta and Ed, on people like Leah and Emme, on people like Roz who hold the middle while the rest of us do our show.

Elise put her palm flat against mine and moved her matching hand to my sternum and pressed until I thought my bones would ask for names. “There,” she said, a steady, “there, there. Stay where I am.” She kissed her thumb and touched my sternum with it and then pretended not to notice my eyes go ridiculous. “We are okay,” she said. “We are better than okay. We deserve this weight and we can set it down when the music stops.”

When I went to my bag for the last time before stepping into the wings, the zipper slid strangely. There is a tone the human body emits when it knows a thing the mind has not caught up to. I pulled the bag open and saw that inside, arrayed beautifully like a still life, were four sunflower shells, one on each corner of my towel. They were placed with a kind of ceremonial care that made me inhale a little too much. On the towel, two rips faced each other like lips. My laces were fine; my spare laces were there; my shoes were there; the ribbon from before sat like a whisper. Under it all, a scrap of paper I did not own had been put. It was torn from something pocket-sized. In tiny block letters someone had written, less nice, more bite.

I looked for teeth marks and found none. I looked for humor and found some. I looked for malice and found a small ration of it, the size of a teaspoon. I polished it into competitiveness and put the towel aside with a reverence I did not expect. Elise yelled my name from the wings with the roundness of her mouth that means do not make me come fetch you and I called back that I was moving. I tucked the note into the pocket of my jacket because I am who I am and because sometimes you accept an omen not as a prophecy but as a dare.

In the narrow dark before the stage, the world reduced itself to breath and elbow. The singer on the bill before us finished a very long note and the room gave her its hands, not ungenerous. The light changed, somewhere overhead, to the world we had picked. Ed’s head tilted toward me once and then away. Marta put a hand on my back and squeezed like family. Elise looked at me with her whole face open and then shut her eyes the way she does to re-enter herself. Tomas stood beyond the proscenium, at the far left wing, statue-still, the way a person stands who understands he is not the main thing and also that he built the bridge to it.

“Ready,” said a voice in my ear that I could not place because even my bones were listening to something else. “Ready,” said Elise, low and bright. “Ready,” said the part of me that used to sit in the audience and hold my mother’s hand. The floor did not speak. The mouse did not speak. The house breathed in.

The music started. We stepped forward.Chapter 4

The light is a mouth and we walk into it as if we have silver in our veins. My hand finds Elise the way a bird finds wind. Her palm is dry and narrow, familiar and electric. The first step is always a betrayal of gravity and a promise to it at once, the way a handshake both welcomes and restrains. We breathe on three, not because the music asks for it but because our bodies do, and the floor receives us like it remembers the shape of our weight as well as we do. The tape mark under my toe is a small country I would defend with everything I have.

Tango asks for a spine like a blade and a heart like a bell. We give it the blade first, because that is easier. My chest hooks to hers in the space that is not a hold but a conversation, her forehead a thought away from my jaw. On the QQS my knee forgives less and my ankle stops apologizing for existing. “Less nice,” the note had said, like a dare on a napkin, and I let the sentence climb into the back of my eyes and sit there like a coin on my tongue. When I step into the Corte, I let my heels think like weapons and discover they prefer not to be.

The Schnitz is an old building and it sings with you even when it is not trying. I can hear our steps return to us like second thoughts. The edge of the stage has that tiny downhill tilt that makes you measure your own toes with new respect, so on the first cross I shorten the length a breath and lengthen the idea, and Elise catches the choice and makes it look like it was the point all along. Tomas never claps when he likes something. He does not clap now. He watches with the stillness of a man who believes fervently in gravity and in people who occasionally outrun it.

There is a moment in our routine when the façade of ferocity turns into the actual thing. It is not the promenade or the half-moon. It is the place just before the swivel where I choose, with my lower back and my ribs and some animal part of me that only sees red when given permission, to say no. No to softness as apology. No to the old habit of smiling when a thing hurts. No to the version of myself that thought medicine would be the only hard thing and that art should behave. Elise feels it like a weather change and her chin lifts a millimeter and her left hand does not ask my right for permission because it does not need it.

The audience is not there until it is, a wave I am not supposed to look at. They were a softness at the edge of my vision and then they are a bank of heat. I feel the smell of cologne and the powdery ghost of a bouquet someone held three rows in. I swear I hear my mother’s ring slide against the paper program and Leah’s whisper carried on a stranger’s laugh, the way you hear the shape of people you love even when they keep their mouths closed like you asked them to. There is a noise a crowd makes when it forgets to cough in sync and I ride that noise into the pivot like a thief sliding into a door he has oiled himself.

At the heel turn that has taken teeth from us all winter, I think of Tomas’s dry decree that some doors should not squeak and some humans should. My heel finds the floor like it belongs to it and Elise’s rotation comes through my axis like music you don’t have to count because you already live there. For a single instant we are a machine that has forgiven itself for being made of flesh. It feels like I owe apology to no one and to everyone, like a train schedule and a river. It is ridiculous to be sentimental in the middle of a turn and yet I say to myself, privately, like a toast made in an empty kitchen, thank you for letting me have this one.

The Viennese comes like a knife in a nice suit. We’ve stitched it in on purpose, not because the rules required it but because the story did. The judges will decide later whether that is brave or naive, but in the time it takes to inhale I do not care at all. We break hold, we find a breath, we re-enter on a second that is too skinny for the amount of weight we drop into it, and the roll of strings does the thing that made me want to be a dancer at all, which is to remind me that time is elastic if you are gentle and rude in the right proportions. “The music will not apologize for you,” Tomas said, and the music does not.

Somewhere in the second chorus my right knee registers a complaint about a thing I asked it to do two days ago in a garage that did not deserve my fidelity. It is a small complaint and I answer it with a measured threat and a promise to ice. Elise’s bandaged spot under her knee takes up precisely zero of my attention because she is not interested in being injured and so she is not. The lift we do which is not an actual lift but a suggestion of height turns us both into something avian and then into people again, which is to say we are ourselves with a memory of flying.

On the back third, where endurance makes its argument and art makes its, something changes. At the edge of the wing, a shadow moves that is not a person, a small quick thing the size of a glove crossing from monitor to coil. It is too quick to be anything but what my brain thinks it is, and some childish part of me wants to laugh or point and say, of course, even here. Captain patrols the under-hall and has decided the wing is his, and I respect property law in ancient buildings as devoutly as I ignore parking signs in new ones. Ed does not flinch. Ed flinches at nothing. The mouse disappears into an idea and takes my anxious superstition with him like lint.

The last held shape is our good joke. For weeks we have practiced the art of stopping in public, which is more difficult than starting if you are built like someone who believes in momentum almost as much as he believes in medicine. We find the axis of it and put our eyes where we said we would, not on each other and not on the audience but on a single spot where the balcony rail meets the aisle, where absence lives. We breathe together in the silence the audience gives because they are kind or because they are trying to see if we will break. We do not break. We bend like saints with better shoes.

There is a second after a last note that is worth entire bad years. The room pulls the air back into itself. Someone coughs and someone else tuts them and somewhere a program falls. Elise’s fingers, which can talk on their own about three distinct forms of exhaustion, press twice into my palm, our little code that means you’re here, yes, I check. The applause arrives in its blunt honorable way, not a roar, not a trickle. It feels like a decent part of the world remembered to clap for a decent thing and that will be enough for tonight.

When we leave the light, the black feels like velvet you trip on. Marta is there like a lighthouse with a bobby pin. She pats my arm in a way that would irritate me coming from anyone else and from her steadies my blood where it needs to be. Tomas stands in his spot with that particular smile that is a withholding of a larger one and says, simply, “Good,” and then, in a tone that makes me straighten a vertebra I did not know had options, “Again in your head later. You left three degrees of rotation in the first promenade. You did not need them; you will want them.”

Elise laughs, the kind she does when her lungs are full of heat and pride and mischief. She presses her forehead to mine for a second not because it is romantic but because it is specific. “We did the thing,” she whispers, like a theft that turned out to be legal. Her hair smells like the product we bought together and the inside of a clean closet. Her cheek is hot like an unwise radiator. “We did the thing in front of people with eyebrows. Are you alive?”

“I am arrogant about being alive,” I say, leaning back and finding Roz’s copper eyes, which are shining because she wept for two seconds during the Q-Q-S and would die rather than admit it was anything but the eyeliner. Roz hands us both a bottle of water with the tops already cracked and then glares at the bottle like it suggested she smile more. “Any deaths,” I ask her. “Any spilled glitter; any curse that needs reversing.”

“Everyone dies of their own habits,” she says, which is her version of praise. “You made them look like virtues. Also, your mother tried to go backstage and Marta threatened to truss her like a ham. Your mother told her she respected boundaries and then gave her a cookie. I love your family. Now go sit down because your legs are lying to you. And do not look at your phone or I will remove your thumbs.”

I mean not to look at my phone and I mean to be the man who moves through victory with monk-like detachment, but I am also the man whose clinic portal pings during dates and who breathes more easily when EMR tabs are closed. I sit on the narrow bench by my bag and drop my forehead to the back of my wrist and tell myself I am smelling the faint clean of detergent and not the iron of nerves. When I lift my head, the bag gives that small new resistance again, as if the zipper has decided it will only be loyal if I deserve it.

Inside, there is a settledness where chaos could be. The towel with its two rips is folded carefully by a hand that does not belong to me and does not belong to Elise. The spare laces have been wrapped around themselves and tucked into the heel of my shoe like a superstition grandma would approve of if we had a grandma in the room. On the towel, arranged like a quiet joke, are two shells only, their faces toward each other like they are speaking. Under them is another scrap of paper, this one torn from the opposite side of the same pocket notebook by the look of the ragged edge. It says, in the same patient block hand, I liked your spine. Keep your teeth.

I feel that peculiar split where half of me warms and half of me wants to break something gentle just to make a point. It is an intimacy I did not consent to and a coaching that sounds like Tomas if Tomas wore a mask. It is advice I did not exactly need and exactly wanted. It is a line I should not cross and will, because parts of me do not take orders well when they are spoken softly. Elise reads it over my shoulder and hums in her throat. “Less murderous today,” she says, voice even. “Still intrusive. Still weird. Does it feel like the text person to you.”

“No,” I say, surprised at my own certainty. “The text voice is a hallway after the bell. This voice is someone who thinks they are being helpful and thinks their intimacy is earned because they have watched me long enough to take a liberty. Or someone who is pretending to be that person. Or a mouse with a pen.”

Roz plucks the note and the shells with the tips of two fingers as if they are mildly radioactive and drops them into the pocket of her jumpsuit with an air of tidying a small mess at a cousin’s wedding. “Ed has a woman at the stage door whose face could cut brick,” she says. “I will show her this and she will take offense on my behalf. In the meantime, lock your things in the trunk of my car because men who take liberties tend to take other things. We have two more acts before the break. Watch Sebastian and get all your jealousy out at once or you will get stomach acid in the waltz.”

Sebastian is very beautiful on a stage. It is disgusting and instructive. His spine is a hose he controls with his mind and his face is a study in what it looks like not to doubt your own ability to be adored. He does a run backward in Latin heels that would make a priest swear and his partner’s hair becomes an event and I am glad, unreasonably, to have been born in an era when hair can be an event. He finishes and bows with a humility entirely engineered and, to my shame, effective. The audience claps with that appreciative middle that will remember his jawline better than his foot placement. He looks, just once, at the wing where we stand and mouths, you were clean, and it is less poison than I would have assigned him. It is almost kindness. The world complicates itself even when you want it to play easier parts.

At intermission, the lobby inhales us. People glide and trip and look at the posters for things they will attend and say they won’t and plans their friends will puncture with sleep and weather. My mother finds me like a homing device made of gray hair and teacups. She kisses my temple as if I am still the temperature of boy and says, “If there were a volcano and a god, I would throw my good earrings into the mouth and ask him to keep you safe from slippery floors and misplaced metaphors.” She has damp at the corner of her eye and a smear of lipstick she does not know about. “You were severe in the best way. You made me remember to sit up.”

“I am practicing texts to send to God about her use of certain metaphors in her judging,” I say, which is possibly a sentence that would have gotten me disowned last century. “Thank you for not rushing the stage. Roz says you bribed Marta.”

“I did nothing of the sort,” she says, dignity covering the fact that she would absolutely bribe a TSA agent with biscotti. “I am well-behaved at the theater. I taught you not to cough during adagios. Also, there was a small animal in the corner near the orchestra rail. Either it was a mouse or I am aging into a person who hallucinates theatrical rodents. Do they have names.”

“Captain,” I say, because it pleases me that she will tuck away the detail and bring it out at inappropriate times. “He is a crusty old man who respects gaffer tape and will steal from the unguarded.”

She sobers a gray degree and touches the underside of my wrist, the spot where you can feel the insistence of anyone. “Do not be stolen from,” she says. “Do not be unguarded with people who congratulate you while they count your eyelashes. Do not be suspicious of joy; it does not deserve that. I am going to sit before the lights flash again. Tell me if I clap wrong.”

Back by the wings, Ed’s hand is in his pocket and then out and then in like breathing. He nods at Roz whose pocket is now carrying contraband in the shape of two shells and a sentence and his mouth tightens not at us but at the idea of an idea. “We can move your bag into a cabinet I trust,” he says. “We can give you a volunteer who looks like a romance novelist’s cover model to stand near it and look like violence. We can put a small camera on this corner and I can stand here and frown for an hour. I will do all three.”

“I don’t want to make this your show,” I say, ashamed of attention that is not the kind I asked for. “But yes, to all three. Also, the blocked-number person sent a message about the floor being hungry and new laces, which would have worked better if my laces had broken or my throat had. We told you before. I am telling you again so I can pretend I did a decent thing.”

Ed’s face softens in the way a face can when it decided to be someone’s uncle for the next four minutes. “To be clear, nothing in my building wants you to fail. Floors are not hungry. They are bored. They like dancers like cats like cardboard. And everyone thinks their joke is original until they meet a stage manager. Carry on.”

We do carry on. The second half is a hunger you can feed if you bring the right food. It matters less for us because we are done throwing our bodies at strangers and more because we will learn who else will throw theirs and how well. Behind the velvet, strangers behave like versions of cousins and you begin to pick favorites. There is a lindy couple from Spokane whose joy is mustard-yellow and contagious and a ballroom pair from Salem who are so elegant it makes me suspect they iron their air. There is a boy who cannot be older than seventeen who has the posture of a man who tells other men things in court and a girl whose nails are painted the same blue as a treble clef who hugs everyone who passes and does not make it weird.

Tomas drains the last of his tar and throws the cup into a trash bag with a disdain that suggests the bag and he have history. He leans near enough for me to pretend not to feel fathered and says, “When they speak later, the poets, they will tell you a small truth and dress it in birds. Listen for the bird and not the dress. And if there are results you do not like, remember that you owe your body kindness before you owe it improvement.”

I promise to try to learn kindness like a foreign language and he smirks because he has seen me attempt grammar. In the wash of people, Sebastian passes and touches his heart in that antiseptic show of humanity performers deploy, and I do not hate him for it because I am tired and my feet are generous. His partner lets her mouth actually smile and in that instant she looks like a person I might trust with a secret about a small animal. I do not.

There is the part of the night where the judges speak into mouths that do not need microphones and say the things that make people taller and shorter by turns. They are as advertised. The first one, a woman with hair like punctuation and shoes that could start a small war, says our heel turn was the most honest door she has seen opened this season, that we did not squeak, that we contained our storm like a teapot with opinions. The second, a man with eyebrows that do not recognize compromise, says our promenade lacked menace at the top, as if we did not entirely believe we had the right to the room until the strings told us we did. He says, with a small barbed sweetness, “I wanted more teeth,” and I try not to make a face like a man who has inside jokes with strangers. The third, a younger person in a suit that fits like an apology for all previous suits, tilts their head and says we are a medicine cabinet with whiskey in it, which is either an insult or the best thing anyone has ever said to me.

Results are a ritual. The paper under Ed’s hand has already told him what is happening and his face is a country with good looks but no borders. He reads from his list with the care of a mail carrier and the words go out and hit bodies and make them warm or cold. We are not called first and we are not called last. We are called in a slot that makes generosities and disappointments both plausible. We are Top Three and not one, which is an answer that will keep you honest and keep you awake. The lindy couple who brought mustard-yellow come in fourth by a whisker and hug each other like it is the end of war, and Sebastian’s jawline is very acceptable to judges who like blue light, and when he takes the one I feel the small bitter that is not poison but a spice you have not yet learned how to cook with.

Elise stands with her hands so still I almost check her pulse. Then she relaxes her shoulders the way a person does when a full sentence has arrived and it isn’t what they wrote and it’s still smart. She says, “Okay,” as if the word has weight training, and she tips her head against my shoulder for exactly one count of four. “We did it. We did not do everything. We did a thing worth doing and we get to keep doing it. I want gelato. I want fries. I want to sleep for thirteen days. I want to call your mother and make her explain the difference between eucalyptus and the other one.”

“Fir,” I say, which makes her roll her eyes in a way that feels like water.

Backstage breaks into its afterpicture. The stagehands coil the cords in a way that would calm a nervous system if we taught nervous systems to watch for competence. Ed slips his headset to his neck and looks tired in a way that respects his bones. Volunteers collect roses and rogue wraps and the improbable number of water bottles human beings can leave behind when their hearts are elsewhere. Captain does not appear again; he has had his show and prefers anonymity. Roz returns my bag with a tiny brass lock she has placed on it that she holds the key to like a fairy who is also a bouncer.

At the back door, cold air supplies clarity as if from a vending machine. The alley smells like ash and rain and the secret snacks of people who work in buildings like this. The volunteers brag about how quickly they got someone to the medic when a heel went wrong in the second act and about the kindness of a tenor who remembered everyone’s name. Marta stands with her hands on her hips and surveys the evening like a field she has harvested. She takes the shells and the note from Roz and tucks them into a plastic sleeve that contains incident forms and a Sharpie and a spool of mercy. “We will file this under ‘theater people are not always theatrical,’” she says, dry.

My phone has not buzzed in hours, which is its own unnerving weather. When we get to the car, it lights like a fish under a dock and I look because I am a predictable animal. The blocked number says, New teeth. Good. Don’t get cocky. Floors remember. It is so nearly practical that I want to send it a bill. I take a photograph of the screen and send it to Ed and Elise and Roz with a note that says, same hand, new number, same hunger, and then I put the whole thing in a mental box with a handwritten label that reads for later: indignation, measured.

At home that night, the rain returns as if it had been waiting on the other side of town for an applause of its own. My mother wraps herself in a sweater that has seen more winters than some friendships and falls asleep in the chair with a book on her chest like a faithful animal. I sit on the floor because the floor permits the sensation of sanity and stare at my shoes like they are a riddle I almost answered. Leah’s star sits where Elise clipped it earlier and it catches the light from the street in a way that suggests luck and work are often the same thing viewed from different angles. I take the note out of my pocket and consider the block letters and the steadiness of the hand and the peculiar care with which someone has decided to coach me without speaking to me like I am the last man in a gym and they want me to do the postscript.

I tell myself the mouse brings shells because that is what mice do, because anyone would if anyone were a mouse, because it is hilarious to live in a city that names its ghosts. I tell myself a person brings shells because they have found a way to make themselves feel close to me without admitting that is what they are after, because that is how loneliness dresses itself up on a Saturday night. I tell myself it is all theater and none of it is theater and then I put the note in the drawer with my cufflinks and two tiny screws and the ribbon Elise gave me to tie my program when I pretend to be someone who keeps things neat.

Sleep comes like an uninvited friend and sits heavy. I dream of a room without corners and of my father showing up late with glitter and outrage, of Leah rolling her eyes in slow motion, of Ed telling a floor to behave, of Tomas swallowing a star and pretending not to notice. I dream that the mouse, in a small vest no one should have made and yet did, drags a pencil three times his size into a crack and writes the word hungry in a secret place, and in the morning I cannot decide whether to laugh or call a locksmith.

The morning after any triumph you are not supposed to go to work because the world tells you to let glory soak in, but the world also loses audio when you need it to tell you sensible things. I go to clinic because Monday is a verb there and because two of my patients promised not to die over the weekend if I would let them tell me one more time how bad the coffee is. Leah has placed a newspaper article on my desk with a circle around my name and a highlighter star and the words underlined, local doctor dances, which is the kind of headline that makes it sound like doctors do not usually move their bodies. Emme leaves me a sticky note that simply says, cake at noon, and a drawing of a mouse holding a sparkler. I am a man stitched to a community and I know it and the stitches feel like the kind you keep, not the kind you itch to remove.

Between nine and ten, the blocked number does not speak. Between ten and eleven, a message arrives from a different strange number that says only, do you like yellow. I stare at it long enough to make yellow meaningless and then realize I am looking at the Lindy couple’s mustard joy again in my mind and decide I am not in the mood to donate brain time. I screenshot it, I forward it to our small circle, and then I open a file for a patient whose kidneys have written a letter of resignation and I methodically refuse to accept it.

At lunch, cake is a rectangle of ordinary magic with salt on top. I put the fork in and feel heard by a person with flour on their forearms. Leah sits with her knees out like a person who made her peace with comfort and says, as if discussing weather, “I liked your face when you stopped. Everyone’s face is loud when they move; a face is honest when it is still.” I tell her she produces aphorisms like almonds, handfuls when you least expect it, and she aims a napkin at me and misses on purpose.

After lunch, Roz calls the clinic line and says, without hello, “Hector has news I do not want. He found a shell on top of the card reader. This means the goblin knows finance. Also, the landlord says Thursday again in a voice that suggests Thursday is an idea and not a day. Also, a bouquet came for you at the studio and it does not smell like hurt feelings; it smells like real flowers. I am suspicious of real flowers from unknown persons. Do I put them in water or set them on fire.”

“Water,” I say, because I am not prepared for arson before three p.m. “Read the card and be my aunt about it. If it’s from my mother I will die. If it’s from Sebastian I will laugh until I cry. If it’s from a human whose number is blocked I will bring Ed to your front desk like a ritual.”

She says, rustling, “It is not from your mother. It is not from your jawline competitor. It is from a person who writes as if they live in 1961. ‘Congratulations on remembering your bones. The floor and I are friends and sometimes adversaries. I enjoyed watching you negotiate. Less niceness looks good on you. —C.’”

“C like Captain,” I say, because if I do not make a joke I will have to go lie down, and Roz snorts in solidarity and then exhales the way she does when she wants to stop giving oxygen to a thing. “Or C like a person whose name I do not know who thinks anonymity makes candor charming.”

“Do not let them name your work,” she says, and for a second loses her irony and becomes a banner someone could march under. “Do not let them name your fear either. I will put the flowers where my jumpers can smell them. If they wilt weird I will call a priest.”

By late afternoon the adrenaline has burned itself into ash and the ash has become customary. The world did not end when we did not win. The world did not end when we were very good. The world did what it does best, which is keep being. In the early evening I walk out to my car in a small Beaverton rain that has decided to be a friend and I think, as stupidly and briefly as you would expect, that I might actually know how to be in two places at once if I do not name either place a burden. I think that perhaps the thin plank I described to myself in the garage is not a plank but a bridge, and that bridges are meant to be walked and do not require apologies for feet.

When I get home, my mother has left with a note that says, in her quick hand, the mouse is an omen of the best kind because it means even in pretty places there is hunger and life. Do not starve yours. I love you in a way that makes me forgive your haircut. I put the note next to the shells I did not throw away and the star Leah lent me and the safety pin Marta gave me and I look at these ridiculous totems and I allow myself a luxury I have not permitted in some time. I let the water run in the shower until it is too hot and stands a chance against the places in me that have been tight like a drum for months. I stand in it and lean my head against tile that has needed scrubbing for weeks and I count my blessings like a person who has been accused of hoarding and is trying to inventory.

There is a sound at the edge of the apartment then, a tiny scuffle so faint I could pretend it is a neighbor expecting twins or a pipe remembering its youth. I turn the water off because I am a person who will always turn down the soundtrack to hear the plot. There, again, under the kitchen counter, a thread of movement I could have conjured from fatigue. I have an unreasonable picture of a small creature in a vest with a pencil, of an angry prince with opinions about gaffer tape and financing and footwork, and I laugh, quietly, at myself for being so susceptible to stories. I put a towel around my waist and step carefully into the kitchen as if I am stepping onto a stage. I crouch, ridiculous, and look under the counter at a shadow that is just a shadow and nothing with eyes. I say, into the perfectly normal emptiness, “We will not be leaving snacks,” and the room does not answer and I am relieved and disappointed in equal measure.

The next days are the slow burn of after. People write to say things you will keep and things you will delete to make room for the kept. A reporter calls to ask how one balances arteries and ankles and I say something about lists and love that will sound trite on paper and true if you know me. Sebastian posts a photograph in which we appear in the background out of focus and he tags us in a way that is both generous and mercenary. The studio sells out a beginner salsa class because a seventeen-second clip made a ninth grader in Tigard cry for reasons she cannot explain to her father and he signed up with her because he loves her and because he believes in what he cannot name.

The texts continue with their odd breathless punctuation and their practicality like a knife sent in the mail with no return address. You did not slip because you paid attention. Corners are worse than middles. Work the edges of your shoes. I do not know if this person wants to be my worst angel or my strangest friend. I tell Ed each time. Ed’s patience grows a bark that he refuses to show me but I can hear it when his thumbs hesitate over the phone, when he says, “We are not public yet, and yet. The world insists on its hold. We can block and we can report and we can tell the police and the police can put it on a pile. In the meantime, we can move through the world like a line you draw thick and not like a smudge.”

I practice lines. I practice niceness that is not capitulation and teeth that are not cruelty. I practice my job with the same devout attention I give a promenade and discover that the same muscles that keep a big feeling from looking fake keep a bad feeling from looking impossible. Mr. Ingersoll brings me a cupcake with purple frosting and says he yelled at the livestream in his living room when our wheel tried to argue with the physics of the stage and that his wife laughed at him and he loved her for it. I tell him that we came in third and I am proud enough to be embarrassed and he says, “Third made me open the second beer at a decent hour. First would have kept me up too late.”

On a wet Thursday that draws black lines down the window, Elise and I meet in Studio B again because we are not done because nothing is. The floor has been mopped by someone who is both thorough and resigned to human error. The vending machine hums its righteousness. The bungee that holds it to the wall has frayed in an aesthetically pleasing way and someone has tied it again with care. Roz has placed the “THIS IS TEMPORARY” tape at a new angle and it makes me want to be better. We drill basics because basics are how you tell the future a story about your intentions. We talk about a new piece because the old one is a story we can tell in our sleep and I do not entirely trust anything I can do without being awake.

Tomas watches with a pleasure that he hides in a pocket, and mid-way through the hour he makes a small noise and waves us down and tells us a story I did not know he had. “In Zagreb,” he says, or Ohio, I still do not know and neither does he, “there was a teacher who carried a mouse in his pocket because he believed that the animal had a better sense of timing than the metronome. It would climb to the lip of the pocket at different places in the music. He said when it sat very still, you were lying. So he kept dancing until it moved.”

Elise grins because she loves a ridiculous method that might also be a spiritual practice. I shake my head because I know he is interfering with my superstition on purpose and I love him for it. “What did he name it,” I ask, as if that matters.

“He did not name it,” Tomas says, approving. “He said names make pets out of everything and he had no time for pets that had any chance of dying before him.”

We end that practice laughing and then not laughing and then both, the way people who have been nearly excellent behave when they are tired and want to be dangerous again. When we gather our things, I find one more precise shell in my bag, placed with the care of an apology and the nerve of a dare. There is no note. The absence is its own speaking. I pick it up between thumb and forefinger and feel, for one tick of the clock, not watched but witnessed. It is a difference I cannot rationalize and I do not have to. I put the shell with its siblings in a small glass jar I did not know I owned and set the jar on the windowsill at the studio, where the light can touch it and anyone who needs to roll their eyes can.

If someone is playing a game, I refuse to lose at the part where you become the version of yourself they wanted you to be. If a mouse is minor royalty in a kingdom of tape and floorboards, I will tithe to him in the only currency I can afford, which is attention in moderation. If a crowd can make me taller by clapping, then a quiet can make me taller by believing me when I say I am not done growing.

It is March bleeding into April. The rain remembers here and then forgets, and the sky tries out coin-gray and mouthy blue and a white that has too much sun in it to be benign. The cherry trees let go of themselves and coat the sidewalks with paper we did not write on. I stand in two rooms that are the same and different until my shoes feel like an argument I am winning. I keep my hands open enough to hold a thing without crushing it. I listen at the baseboards not for scuttles but for the unpleasant sound of myself beginning to behave like a person who believes any of this is owed to him. When I hear it, I knock; I laugh; I call Roz; I go back to the floor. And when the floor does that small arrogance it has of being indifferent and eternal, I bow like a man who knows better than to pick fights with old wood. Then I ask it, politely and with my teeth, to dance.Chapter 6

The week after the Schnitz unfurled like a ribbon that had been wound too tight and then released; it curled back on itself in places and lay flat in others, and each morning I would find a new bend and identify it like a doctor identifies murmurs without thinking. Monday turned its face toward clinic and I obeyed. Tuesday was the kind of wet that makes the paint on the crosswalks glisten. Wednesday belonged to Elise’s school, which means it belonged to five kinds of bureaucracy and fourteen kinds of heart. By Thursday I had stopped waking in the night to conjure the stage, and by Friday I could walk past a mirror without checking if my spine still held the secret the judge said it did. People had opinions in the grocery store. People had opinions in the portal. The nice opinions made me blush like an adolescent and the less nice ones made me taller for twelve seconds and then shorter for an hour. All of it felt like weather, amusing and dangerous if you stayed out in it too long without a coat.

On Saturday morning the hospital held a fundraiser in a conference room someone had attempted to disguise as a ballroom. There were uplights against walls that wanted to be beige even when you convinced them to be gold, and round tables with linens so stiff they could stop a bullet, and a banner that declared the name of the event in a font that has never been accused of elegance. I was not on the bill but I was on the hook. Leah had convinced me with the argument that nurses in this hospital have learned to lift buildings and the least I could do was lift my feet. She wore a badge that said CHAIR in a way that implied she could sit in any room and decide where everyone else should go. Emme circulated with a clipboard and cinnamon on her breath, whispering that the silent auction included a basket of artisanal salts she had misgivings about as a concept and the right to name a therapy dog, which seemed like too much power to give to anyone with twenty minutes and a Visa.

Elise came in a black dress with sleeves she tugged by habit, and her hair sleek in a way that made adults who write checks nod in approval. She has a presence at daytime events that makes people confess tax fraud and then donate to avoid jail. I wore a suit that made me feel like I was about to apologize in a board meeting and then refuse to, and Tomas slipped in late with a scarf like punctuation and stood at the back making a face that meant the music was too loud and the donors too eager and the coffee too gentle for anyone who wanted to survive. Roz could not bear the room and pretended she came because they had said the word “dance” out loud near a bar but really came because people she loves were in a space that had too many exits and not enough windows.

We did not do a number; we did an invitation. Ed’s part in this was to send us a text the night before that said, Be visible but not loud, and I wrote back, This is a problem for me; I enjoy being loud, and he responded with an emoji that looked like a theater sighing. We shook hands and said hello and looked at each other’s shoes in the way of people who notice what people are standing on. Someone asked for a demonstration and I said no in a way that sounded like yes if the room asked as a group, and the room did, which is an old trick of polite extortion. Elise leaned in and said, under the clink of glass and the chuff of a rented coffee machine, “It will be fine. Two slow walks and a turn. Tomas will pretend we offended his grandmother and Leah will collect five checks because of it.”

The floor in those rooms is always a game of chance; here it was carpet that had a memory of a different carpet from nineteen-ninety-three and a will of its own. We picked a small rectangle where the carpet complained less and did a walk that was not a walk so much as a suggestion that we might, on occasion, move our bodies in unison for the joy of people whose jobs require them to remember death differently than we do. Elise smiled the smile that appears on her face when she is using her craft the way a baker uses flour to coax a quiet person into speech. I kept my body polite with strangers and slightly rude with gravity, and when we turned the room did that oh the way a room does when it has forgotten that two people in black can pin its attention to one moving point. When it was done, donors clapped in that way that means thank you for reminding us we have joints. Leah pocketed a stack of pledges with the efficiency of a general stealing maps and winked at me like she was saving the city while teaching a child to tie his shoes.

At the corner of the bar, a woman with a haircut that made her look like the answer to a question I did not think to ask lifted her glass in our direction as if blessing and appraisal were the same motion. Later she caught my sleeve with a fingertip that wore too many rings and said, “You’re the doctor who dances. I’m the gala chair who needs a doctor with better knees next year. I loved your spine,” and then laughed in a way that made the sentence less threatening and more like she had told a joke at a dinner where everyone had decided to be kind. On the charity table, a basket full of sunflower seeds in five flavors sat with a raffle ticket stuck in a ribbon that read GARDEN PARTY, and Emme, who saw me see it, moved the basket an inch to the left and said in a voice that belonged to a medic, “Not today, weird gods.”

The texts had not stopped; they had changed. The blocked number had learned to be less obviously theatrical. It sent me practicalities like a stagehand sends a shrug. Tape the hem of the practice pants so the floor doesn’t flirt. Put your bag on a shelf. Walk the corners when the room is empty. In the hospital ballroom, as donors gathered and music tried to be something else, my phone buzzed with a sentence that made my shoulders come up and then settle. It said, in the block letters I could have traced now with my eyes closed, Numbers matter. Three is not losing. Quiet is loud. I took a photograph and forwarded it to Ed and Roz and Elise with the caption: we are being coached by a ghost who reads results, and Roz wrote back, Tell your ghost to Venmo the studio for the last three months since they like being involved, and Elise wrote, I am going to give your ghost a syllabus and a detention, and Ed wrote, I am redirecting this annoyance into a document.

Seattle called on Tuesday with a polite email and a tone that, if it had a color, would have been silver. The Sound & Step Gala, which had a reputation for treating dancers like creatures the world should invest in, wanted to know if we would make the trip north for a spring showcase, not a competition but a curated evening where the curation would include us if we said yes. The date was three weeks away. The rehearsal scheduling would make Emme curse and Roz invent a new kind of excel. Seattle means different rain; it means bridges that look like instruments; it means coffee even when you don’t want coffee. Elise read the email aloud in the studio and then again with her head tipped like a dog hearing a high whistle. Tomas listened and shrugged one shoulder in a way that meant he cared more than he looked like he did. Roz did a hand motion that was either a blessing or a threat to highways. I said what I say when a thing is both preposterous and inevitable: “We should do it; I can work only fourteen jobs that week instead of fifteen.”

We made a plan that was less a plan than three calendars arguing. Elise would take two mornings from her school and give them back in June when ninth graders are made of near-graduation and regret. I would trade with Laurie from family med and owe her a bottle of something aged and unrepeatable. Leah said, simply, “I can cover the portal for a day; do not break a tibia,” and Emme said, “Your admirers can leave cake on your desk and I will guard it like a dragon until you return.” I sent a message to my mother that said, We are going to Seattle, do you need a ride from Eugene if you want to see a different city remind itself no one asked it to be dramatic; she wrote back a picture of a map with little pins and, because she is herself, a paragraph about ferries as metaphors that made me cry at the stoplight under the canyon of downtown.

Elise’s school had a week that clenched; when schools clench, the air changes. I could see it at the door when I stopped by to pick her up for practice one day because our calendars had requested we share a car. A kid with a backpack large enough to carry a future huddled under an exit sign. A teacher on lunch duty moved with the precise pace of someone who will not rush a child who is crying because rushing is the same thing as failing loudly. Elise emerged with her jaw set and her voice warmed up for calm. She had a text chain open with three parents and a vice principal and someone at the district who had failed to meet her yet and would not forget the experience. She gets called into rooms where psyches have decided they are fragile glass and need a glove to hold them. She does not flinch. I waited with my hands in my pockets for the part of the day that was ours and understood, not for the first time, that sometimes the most dazzling thing you can do with your body is keep it still and your face kind.

We arrived at the studio late and guilty, and the guilty part melted by the time we had laced and stood in the rectangle of light that Studio B tilts toward afternoon. Roz had taped a hand-written sign behind the desk that said PLEASE DO NOT FEED THE GOBLIN and beneath, in a different pen, someone had added, HE HAS DIETARY RESTRICTIONS and someone else had crossed that out and written, HE EATS JOY. Hector had placed a humane trap near the vending machine baited with granola that would make a cyclist weep and the mouse, who knew his worth and his preferences, had declined to move. In my bag, which I now placed in a cabinet with a lock that had cost less than my peace and was possibly the best purchase of the quarter, I found no shells, which somehow felt like a loss. I closed the door and stood under Tomas’s eye and we did basics with an attention I had missed during all the running of all the time.

The new piece arrived like a shy animal. Elise has a process that refuses crowding; she has to hum near a thing and allow it to approach. She had a song on her phone she would not let me hear until she was sure it would not break us. It had strings and drums that had a mind like a drum should, and a patience in its middle that reminded me of the hum in a clinic hallway at eleven when the walk-ins stop walking and the charts lean against each other like exhausted sheep. She played it and Tomas did that thing where he pretends to leave. He stood with his back half turned and his eyebrow arched in case we needed the eyebrow and not the man. We marked without marking, little shifts in the body that are the pre-language of choreography. We found a weight on three that felt like a bet and like a prayer. We named nothing. We wrote nothing down. We let the music leave fingerprints on our muscles and then left the room so we wouldn’t ruin the prints.

Sebastian, who had returned to being a citizen of the world with an Instagram following and a jawline that caused accidents of small and large sorts, appeared in the doorway with two paper cups and a face that wanted to be candid without being seen. He said, as if it happened to him in the shower and he regretted it, “You were better than thirds,” and I said, because truth deserves its small teeth, “So were you,” and he grimaced like a man who had to admit the floor had been his wife and she had slept with someone else. He said, “I got a message with sunflower emojis from a number with no name; it said, ‘work the corners,’ and I nearly threw my phone into the river, which would have been dramatic but also would have drowned a thousand pictures of my dog,” and I felt that warm-cold of recognition slide up my back. He held up his own blocked block of text, a cousin to mine, and for a minute we were allowed to be two people whose lives would get on better if no one tried to make them into metaphor in the margins.

In the same breath, he did a cruel impression of a judge and then laughed at himself; in the same minute, his partner appeared without sound and took his hand like a person collecting what belongs to her and nodded at us with the exact level of humanity she was able to spare without collapsing. There are rooms you do not intend to be part of that still invite you in. I learned a thing about myself in that doorway, which is that I want my rivals to be exactly as good as they can be and myself a breath better, and that wanting it does not make me wrong. There is a flavor of arrogance that tastes like sharpened strawberries and on some days I have earned it.

At clinic, a patient coded on a Wednesday afternoon because death has no schedule and the body is a house with fuse boxes built by men who were good at wood and guessed about electricity. It happened in room five, which has a window that looks at a maple that has not decided whether to leaf this year or move to Tucson. We did the things that people trust strangers to do with their bodies when it is time to be rescued or not. Hands on sternum, elbows locked, a rhythm that is not music except for the desperate metronome of hope. A nurse named Alberta turned her voice into steel and gave me the line I needed; a paramedic whose name I never caught let me feel how they wanted my pressure and my relentlessness and not my despair. We pulled a person through the small door that leads back into a long hall. When the gurney disappeared, Leah leaned against the sink and repeated a word that has more uses in a hospital than anywhere else in the world: okay. Okay, okay, okay, like gospel, like a rock rolled back from a mouth.

I walked out into the bad kind of light you get at three forty-six and sent a message to Elise that said, simply, breathing, and she wrote back, we are, and then, come slow if you come, and I did, slow, and the studio looked like a country that had not been at war that day. That is a kindness you do for each other in a community; you keep your own tragedy from bleeding into the corners. We did basics until my hands stopped remembering chest compressions, and then we allowed the new piece to put its thumb on our foreheads and push gently until something in us fell into the place where gravity wants you and you want it.

On Thursday night an all-ages salsa social unspooled itself across the studio like a ribbon from a gift no one expected. Teenagers came in wearing new shoes they had bought with babysitting money or with the cash their grandmother insisted on pressing into their palms as if cash is a blessing that loses power in plastic. The room filled with a smell like shampoo and fries and sugar and the air that hangs around young people who have decided not to die. Hector took money with apologetic gravitas. Roz pierced the entry with her eyes and found the kids who were trying not to be seen and made sure they were. Tomas wore a shirt that said PRACTICE IS LESS ROMANTIC THAN YOU THINK and leaned against the DJ table until the DJ admitted he was playing something too clever and changed it.

Halfway through there was a shriek near the snack table that turned out to be the kind of shriek that is a prelude to giggling. The mouse made a run for the far wall like an aristocrat who has realized the party has too many people who pronounce the wine wrong. He cut across two pairs of shoes and an argument about whether social dancing should count toward P.E. credit and stopped by the leg of the folding table long enough to glare at a nacho. He lifted onto his haunches as if to address the room. The teenagers, who understand celebrity more intuitively than theology, cleared a path as if he were an influencer taking a selfie with our bad lights. Roz clapped twice and said, “Sir,” and the mouse reconsidered the nacho and the fame and darted under the vending machine in a motion so clean it made four kids decide to practice their footwork.

After, when the floor had been mopped back into usefulness, I went out to the parking lot where rain had pressed the cherry blossoms into wet confetti across the black. Under my windshield wiper there was a slip of paper with a crease so sharp you could have cut yourself. It was torn from the corner of a program—our program from the Schnitz—a piece of the cast list with half of a name and the words created by in a font that always makes me itchy. On the blank side, in the same patient block letters that had performed so much free labor on my psyche, someone had written, in a tone less cool than the others, Bridges not planks. I want you in Seattle alive. Use your eyes in the diagonals. It is counseling and trespass in one sentence. It is useful and wrong at the same time. I stood there in an Oregon drizzle with paper in my fingers and the sensation that the world was both very small and too large and felt like a man who is being pursued by a benevolent wolf.

I did all the things that make a person feel marginally less foolish and marginally more adult. I took a photo. I sent it to Ed, whose reply said, clean the wiper and check your doors and stop being so interesting. I gave it to Roz, who said, “I could go five different directions with my rage; I will pick the one where I install cameras that do not blink,” and then she hugged me like someone who knows when the human spine needs a second string. I considered calling the police and then pictured the pile where this would live and wrote an email instead to a detective Ed recommended whose nose read like a map. I put the paper in a zipper pocket and then, in the most reluctant surrender I had made in months, I parked under a light where the rain could tell on anyone who stood too long.

The next day I found a quiet I had not had since the theater. It was in the tiny clarity of a morning that did not require a heroic stance. I drank coffee that tasted like someone had roasted a sweater. I read a text from my mother that said she had learned the name of the Seattle ferry she would refuse to get on and wanted to discuss it in detail with Elise. I called Mr. Ingersoll to tell him his chest X-ray had improved and he read me a line from a poem he said he liked to read to his lungs—“teach these feet to walk on water and these hands to row”—and I wrote it down on a sticky note and stuck it to my refrigerator with a magnet shaped like a lemon because I am not immune to charm.

In the studio, we returned to the new piece the way you return to a book that you suspect will change you and you are trying to be polite about it. It had a section in the middle where the music’s patience made us impatient and Tomas, who knows when we want to run and when we should not, made us stay. He talks to us about the diagonals the note mentioned as if he had written it and also as if he had not, because pretending he wrote all our good ideas is his hobby until he is faced with proof. “Eyes are not decoration,” he says. “Eyes are steering. Eyes are indictment. If you look at the wrong thing, your legs will follow your cowardice. Choose better.”

Elise’s body had a new thread in it, a steel that was not there three months ago and had replaced a ribbon that had been useful in its season. She does not apologize with any part of her when she is in that mode. She listens to music with her sternum and then answers with her shoulder blades. It is witchcraft; it is physiology; it is enough. We argued exactly twice, which means we were doing it right. The first time was about the length of a breath between phrases; the second time was about how to pretend you have made a choice when the truth is you were led and decided to call it leadership. Both ended with a gelato and a promise to treat the next impasse like a fire we build together instead of an inheritance we fight over.

The week before Seattle, the studio smelled like lemons and tape and a sense of preparation that treats ordinary things like sacraments. Roz arranged a new set of lockers as if she had declared war on all bad boundaries. Hector taped the bungee in a different way so the vending machine would neither become a bullet nor a memorial. A new sign appeared by the desk that said LOCK YOUR JOY WITH A COMBINATION, which is the gospel of a woman who has had enough of finding tutus under chairs. The jar I'd put on the windowsill with the shells got an addition I had not made. A lone shell sat on the sill, fresh as if it had been put down while we were looking away, and beneath it, written in pen on the glass in a hand that could only be Roz’s because the letters had hips, was: CONSENT OR GET CURSED. It made me laugh out loud and then feel complicated because laughter is not a cure; laughter is a light; you still need locks.

On the Friday before we drove north, a package arrived at the clinic addressed to me care of the front desk. It was the size of a book and weightless enough to make my heart spike. Leah held it like it might explode and said, “If there is confetti I am quitting,” and I said, “If there is glitter I am getting an N95,” and Emme hovered with the look of a person willing to jump on a grenade. I opened it with the worst letter opener on earth and found inside a book, actually, but not a new one. It was a paperback so worn the spine had maps of earlier hands. It was an unpretentious translation of a nineteenth-century tango treatise if such a thing could be said to exist, with notes in the margin in a calm pencil and a postcard tucked into the middle with a photograph of the Schnitz. On the back of the card, in the patient block hand that had become the third person in my group chats, it said, Teeth are not cruelty. They are honesty when you stop apologizing. Do not make me be your worst angel. —C.

Leah made a sound in the back of her throat that could have belonged to a cat or a mother. Emme took the book between her palms and said, “This is intimacy without permission and I do not like it and also I want to borrow this because the endnotes are probably scandalous,” and I said, “Ed gets a copy of the postcard and Tomas gets the book because no one should be trusted with me with literature and a coach who won’t show their face.” We took a photograph, we documented, we turned the moment into an action instead of a feeling because this is how we do not drown in rooms with people in them.

The drive to Seattle was the good kind of long. Elise brought a bag of snacks that made no nutritional sense and Roz had loaned us a playlist that had more horns than you want and exactly the right number of bad decisions in the bridge. The rain behaved politely until Centralia and then sent an emissary to check on us. The highway was a procession of SUVs and existential angst. We stopped at a place with a sign that promised pie and delivered decency. Elise made me pull over once so she could take a picture of fog in a field that had no business making me cry and yet did. My mother texted that she was en route with a friend named Lolly who had opinions about ferry lines and would share them even when asked not to. Tomas sent a photograph of his plants with the caption, Do not die; I am watering.

Seattle itself was a new scale of wet and steel. The very air had the taste of something that expected you to learn its pronunciations before it allowed you to use its names. The Sound & Step theater was less old than the Schnitz and more precise; its backstage smelled like decisions and coffee in small cups. Ed’s cousin, whose name was Arden and whose ability to move six things at once made me believe in time travel, met us at the stage door and distributed badges and kindness. The rules were the same because rules are a liturgy that keeps art from turning into ambulances. The mouse here had a different folklore; someone’s aunt had sworn she saw a rat the size of a raccoon in the eighties and someone else had named a shadow Harold and warned everyone not to step in it. I looked for a sign about feeding animals and found, instead, a note that said DO NOT FEED DANCERS IN THE WINGS, LET THEM HUNGER, which caused Elise to make a sound like a death whistle and Roz to plot a raid on the craft table.

The stage had a rake you felt in your ankles by the third step. The light spoke a different language but wanted the same things. We ran our piece and the corners that had been philosophical in Portland turned into geometry here. The diagonals mattered in a way the note had begged they would. On the second run, Elise’s head remembered a choice before her feet and she changed the color of a count into something like bruise and like sky. A man in a headset made of steel and pity said to a woman with a clipboard, “He’s less nice,” and the woman said, “Good,” and I pretended I had not heard because some compliments are meant to be known and not acknowledged.

Seattle had its own characters. A couple from Vancouver had a polish that made me suspect they travel with their own air. A troupe of teenagers from Tacoma had a teacher with a voice that could sand a floor and hearts that waited to be dared. A soloist with a scar down his shin like a lightning bolt wore shoes that had been resoled so many times they had a doctrine. I liked us among them; I liked our scrapes and our less and our more. Tomas had taught us to walk into rooms imagining we had been invited because we brought the floor a story it wants to hear. We walked like that even when we did not entirely believe it. The room believed it enough to get us the rest of the way.

At the end of our first tech, I found a shell on the lip of the stage left monitor. It was single and placed with a precision that, at this point, made my throat heat with tiredness as much as gratitude. On the gaffer tape by the shell, someone had drawn a tiny arrow toward the diagonal with a Sharpie that had lost its will to live. I crouched and picked up the shell and felt Elise stand over me and lean down. “Captain has cousins,” she said, her voice amused and not. “Or C has friends. Or this is the oldest theatrical prank in the world and we have joined a lineage without consent.”

“I need a universe in which gifts are not all traps,” I said. “I need a minute without riddles.”

“You have one now,” she said, putting a palm on the back of my neck and letting her hand be heavy, which is a kindness more people should learn to offer. “We will give the shell to Roz because she hoards well and she will take its power and turn it into locking cabinets at the community center. Then we will eat, and we will do the piece, and then we will be the kind of tired that feels like clean laundry in a world that smells like rain.”

We ate too much and we did the piece and the audience here had a different way of being silent that I liked, as if they knew how to hold their breath without swallowing room. The applause was not louder than Portland and it did not need to be. My body did something in the middle of the breath that I had hoped it would do and not asked it for; Elise smiled without showing teeth in that place the judges had told us we were honest and I felt a line draw itself across the stage where I had been nice and where I would refuse to be. After, backstage was a river and then a shore. Arden handed us towels as if we had returned from a war that had lasted seventeen minutes and ended in a treatise on posture.

When we stepped out into a Seattle alley that smelled like rope and smoke and the leftovers of the day shift, I felt watched and not hunted, which is the distinction I had been negotiating with myself since the shells began. My phone stayed quiet in my pocket. Roz walked with her hands in her jumpsuit and her jaw set to Protect Everything. Elise had a small smile that belonged to the part of her that knows how to balance on a point without bleeding. The night made all our ghosts taller and then shorter and then forget the choreography that would bring them in our direction.

We drove back the next morning under a sky that wanted to be an ocean when it grew up. The highway was a moving kingdom again. In the rearview a city unstacked itself to make way for whatever was next. We talked about nothing and about everything. We listed the places we had been alive and the places where we had learned to pretend. We passed a truck with a load of lumber strapped down like a promise and Elise said, without looking, “Bridges,” and I laughed and then did not and said, “Yes.”

Back in Beaverton the rain had threaded itself through the afternoon again in a way that made me think of porters moving through old trains, efficient and invisible until you need them. At the studio, Hector had hung a small aluminum bell by the vending machine so we would hear the goblin if he chose to announce his presence like a gentleman. The jar on the sill had four shells and then five and then six, and Roz had set a small white card behind them that read DONATIONS FOR LOCKERS WELCOME and a picture of a mouse with a key. People are very good when you give them something concrete to love. I watched a teenager put a crumpled five in the jar and fluff her hair with a gesture that told me she was going to be a surgeon or a cellist or a border guard for feelings no one else can name.

At clinic Monday, Leah left a printed copy of the Seattle review on my chair with a yellow sticky that said, The poets liked your diagonals; I told you you had diagonals, and drew a heart shaped like an anatomical in-joke. Emme scheduled a half-day for me with the note “human day” and a cookie the size of a map. Mr. Ingersoll called to say the cardigan had lost a button and he would never find another like it and also congratulations on being severe. I texted the blocked number a photograph of a bridge I found on our way home and wrote, unprofessionally, Stop making me like you, and then stared at the screen long enough to make myself angry and then let it go like breath in a turn you have finally learned not to ruin.

That night, in my apartment, I emptied my bag with the care of someone gladly late to a ritual. My shoes were not chewed. My towel had no new mouths. The safety pin Marta had given me still lived in the pocket where I had put it like a relic. I took the book from C and put it on a shelf next to the things I keep when I have given up pretending I am a minimalist. I put the new shell in the jar and took the jar in my hands and heard the faintest click as the glass remembered all it had held before it held these. I slept with the steadiness of a man who has been given good work to do and a map he does not entirely trust and will follow anyway.

The next morning at dawn, the rain turned from thread to bead. Outside, the gutters did their honest work. Inside, the kettle sang its unsingable song. My phone, face down on the counter, sat in a truce with me. When it finally lit, it was not a message from a blocked number but a photo from Elise of a seventh-grader with a plastic medal from a community center competition, grinning like the world had finally admitted it had been wrong about their shoulders. Under it she had written, In case you forgot why we make our spines behave, and I wrote back, I never do, and meant it in a way that surprised me. The mouse did not comment. The floor did not insist. The day began, which is both ordinary and a miracle that never quite learns how to be less impressive.Chapter 8

By the time April learned to unclench its jaw, the rain had started carrying light in it the way old glass does, a thin milk of brightness you don’t notice until you turn your head. The cherry mush on the sidewalks had been combed into gutters by tires and ten-year-olds; the maple outside room five had decided, benevolently and against its own instincts, to leaf. In the mornings the clinic smelled like coffee and printer frustration and a new antiseptic that Leah swore was trying to kill her gently. At the studio the air kept the memory of lemons and sweat and the aftertaste of teenagers, and Roz had taped a sign by the front desk that read CHECK OUT YOUR HUMILITY WITH YOUR SHOES, PLEASE RETURN BOTH when you were done. I lived between a floor that asked me to stop apologizing and a floor that made sick people brave enough to. It suited me until it didn’t, and then it suited me again.

The Monday after Seattle I stood at the sink in the staff room with my hands under the too-cold water and tried to talk my body into believing that two versions of readiness could coexist. The new piece Elise had coaxed out of the air had teeth set into silk; it demanded less ritual and more nerve. Clinic had six portal messages that used the word urgent correctly and two that did not. Emme came in with a clipboard and a braid that had escaped its fastener and said that the hospital wanted a face for a flyer about a public health thing that would anger the public if we did it wrong. Leah pointed at my chest with a pen and said, “Not it,” and then pointed at me again and said, “Fine, it,” and I said, “Only if we get the graphic designer to stop using that font that looks like a haunted kindergarten,” and Emme laughed in a way that told me a font would never be my real problem.

At lunch, I took my sandwich into the hallway to look at the sky the way Leah tells me to. The light pooled in the space between buildings like water deciding whether to be a pond. A man in a reflective vest stood by the bus stop and counted something with his fingers, and a woman in a purple raincoat took a photograph of the sky as if it had performed. I ate quickly, not because there was not time, but because time felt like a tap that someone else had control over, and the trick was to steal sips when they weren’t looking. When I went back in, Leah had left me a sticky note with a drawing of a spine wearing a tiny crown and the words be rude to gravity in her lean practical script. I stuck it to the inside of my locker at the studio later that afternoon and pretended a crown could be utilitarian.

Elise and I met at four with our unremarkable bags and our remarkable relief. The studio had a hush that did not mean quiet; it was the hush you hear when a person is listening to themselves. We warmed up with the slow genocide of calf raises and Elise’s favorite sadistic drill where you stand with your feet together and try to move your rib cage as if it were a separate animal. Tomas watched us and made noises like a grandfather clock about to opine. After our third run of the section we couldn’t name yet—something in the center that refused to be rushed—he stepped into our line as if stepping into traffic and moved my elbow a quarter inch and said, “You keep trying to be hospitable. Stop offering chairs to your own fear. Let it stand.”

“I am a good host,” I said, which made him roll his eyes and then smile in the way he does when he catches me doing the thing on purpose.

“You are, which is its own problem,” he said. “There is a season for hospitality and a season for throwing things out of the house. This is the latter.”

We ran it again and Elise did not apologize with her left shoulder and I did not offer my fear a beverage, and when the music reached for the place where it would usually get me to flinch, I did not. The relief in my body felt like a window finally opened in a room you didn’t realize had been close to unbreathable. Roz looked up from the ledger she was mauling and said, with the nonchalance of a cat complimenting a bird, “That was nasty in the good way,” and then added, “Also, a woman from the community center called about lockers. She says we guilted the teenagers into feeling safe and she is not mad about it but she wants to write us into a grant under ‘small furniture that keeps big feelings from going missing.’”

“Do it,” Elise said, pushing her hair back with the heel of her hand. “They’re going to keep sneaking in their joy if we don’t give it a lock.”

By the end of the week, a plan existed that would not survive contact with weather and still deserved to live. Roz had designed an event and declared that anyone who did not love it would be “gently escorted into the sun to rethink their life choices.” She called it the Goblin Gala and then, because she could not help herself, added a subtitle on the flyer that read A BENEFIT FOR LOCKERS, LIGHTS, AND NOT GETTING OUR SHOES CHEWED. Hector shook his head while smiling at nothing and ordered a box of sixteen locks that would later drive him to a rant about the lack of standardization in key codes.

I had opinions about whether we should invite Sebastian and then felt small for having them. Elise solved it by sending him the flyer and a text that said, This is a party and not a duel. We will quasi-host. There will be snacks and boundaries. He wrote back three minutes later with a photograph of a tuxedo T-shirt and the words, I deeply respect parties with boundaries. His partner, in a separate message that made me like her separately, wrote, I will bring a pan of brownies and one look that will stop men with cameras. Roz accepted both on behalf of decorum.

The day of, Saturday decided to be a friend. The clouds just barely agreed not to be dramatic. The teenagers came in in packs, but the packs contained variations: kids with shoe bags like surgeons with scrub kits; kids who had never owned a pair of dance shoes and had drawn the outline of a sole in marker on their socks; kids who were there to flirt cautiously with futures and kids who were there to help someone else survive the night. Roz ran the door like Ellis Island with incense. Tomas wore his shirt that said DO YOUR BASICS, COWARD and nodded at parents who were trying not to look like they were watching their hearts exit their bodies with new haircuts. I had a roll of wristbands and the very specific joy of snapping them to seventeen-year-old bones that had not yet learned to be ashamed of their wrists.

There were raffles because there are always raffles. There were baskets that contained absurdities and necessities: a certificate for three free shoe polishings; a set of gaffer tape in six colors; a plant pot shaped like an adrenal gland. Roz had insisted on a jar labeled CAPTAIN’S COLLEGE FUND and a line underneath that said HE WANTS TO GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL, and an eight-year-old placed two dollars into it with the gravity of a banker loaning his first million. An auntie with a laugh that turned the air warm bought five tickets for the basket titled “Things You Should Not Leave In Your Bag” and when she won it, kissed the air near Roz’s cheeks with the accuracy of a professional.

Halfway through the evening, with the floor doing its honest work and the music taking a lap around all our spines, the lights flickered with the finesse of a person trying not to faint. The room made the polite murmur people make when something electrical decides to be a protagonist, and then the lights went out with a snap like theatre, which made three teenagers shriek, four laugh, and one hug an enemy. We stood in the big dark together and for a second I could hear the rain outside thinking about its next line. Roz swore softly in a language that sounded like copper scraping against velvet and Hector went hunting for the breaker with a headlamp so dramatic it would have made a raccoon envy. Tomas said, in the darkness like a camp counselor, “We do not move or we move in order,” and the room obeyed, which is not something rooms always do.

Phones lit up like lazy stars. Someone started a clap in the back of the room because humans cannot resist rhythm even when no one has asked for it. Elise’s hand found my sleeve and slid down until her fingers were at my wrist, and the calm in me arrived like a creature that has been waiting for permission to enter. In the splay of light from a dozen small screens I saw a low shadow move along the baseboard with the confidence of a man in his own kitchen; the Goblin took the opportunity to traverse the wall with impunity, stopped by the bungee at the vending machine, and sat back as if considering grand larceny. The bell Hector had hung chimed exactly once like a courtesy. In a corner, a kid laughed the private laugh of someone who has just found a myth to believe in.

We waited with grace longer than rooms usually will. When the lights came back, they came not as an attack but as a slow apology. They hummed up through their own doubt and arrived presentable. The room clapped for electricity as if it had been a soloist who had blown a run and recovered. Roz appeared with a box of tiny LED candles she had not mentioned owning and distributed them as if she’d always planned to, then made a pronouncement that we all agreed had the power of law: “No more chips under the vending machine. The Goblin is in a mood. Do not feed admirers or rodents.” Captain, who has no regard for signage and a healthy disdain for bureaucracy, vanished behind the bungee with a flick of contempt.

Sebastian came and did not wear the tuxedo T-shirt. He wore a sweater that belonged to a ship owner and smiled in a way that made it hard to stay irritated. His partner brought brownies so dense they could be classified as architecture and a look that did indeed stop a man with a camera. They danced one social with a courtesy that did not feel like a press release, and then he leaned against the wall, hands in pockets, and watched the kids on the floor like a man trying to recall a language he used to dream in. During the raffle he yelled numbers with the accidental clarity of someone whose consonants had been coached and got mercilessly teased by a grandmother with chartreuse nails.

We raised enough money that Roz got to order a better set of lockers than her rage had budgeted for. A teenager with a haircut like a manifesto asked if we could paint one of them pink and Roz, who is both a realist and a Catholic where paint is concerned, said, “One locker is your radicalism; the others are the army you join,” and agreed to buy a single can of a color that would offend the landlord. I went into Studio B for five minutes of quiet because five minutes would be a gift I could both give and accept. The room smelled like wood and lemon and something sugared from the brownies. In the slant of light that made the mirrors look forgiving, my bag sat under the lock with the easy posture of a thing that trusted its circumstances and the human who had moved it there.

When I opened it to dig for a towel, I found, in a small curve on top of the folded cloth, one perfect shell. It sat as if it belonged there. No ribbon. No paper. No teeth marks on what I owned. I lifted it with two fingers and said aloud, because talking to objects and their implied authors is now apparently part of my religious practice, “Consent is still a thing,” and put the shell in the jar on the sill, where Roz had lettered with a paint marker: CONSENT OR GET CURSED, with tiny lightning bolts around it like a cartoon revelation. When I stepped back into the hall, a girl of twelve stood there with a plastic tiara canted and eyes that could read rooms. “Is he real,” she asked, not whispering but not challenging either, and I said, “Which he,” and she said, “The mouse, the goblin,” and I said, “He’s as real as a floor that forgives you and as fake as a rumor about your friend you don’t believe,” and she nodded like I had said something that would do for her purposes and went off to remind a boy with too-big shoes to bend his knees.

The next morning I woke into the kind of quiet that exists only when a thing went well the night before and every involved party is granting itself a reprieve. My mother called at nine because she will always be nineish, and said, “If I were a mouse, I would hold people accountable for crumbs. If I were a ghost, I would only haunt the kind of house with good lighting. As I am neither, I have decided to haunt you with sensible advice and carrots. Are you eating.”

“I’m ministering to a loaf of bread,” I said. “We had a good evening. Roz has money for lockers and teenagers have hope that smells like the inside of a gym bag and brownies.”

“What a luxury,” she said, her voice gone soft the way it does when ordinary success pleases her more than spectacle. “Lockers that hold joy. That is a revolution I can still afford to believe in. Anyone trying to be mysterious bother you at an inopportune moment.”

“Only in the approved ways,” I said, and she made a noise that would translate into, I am satisfied for now but do not leave your windows unlatched.

Clinic had its own gala on Tuesday in the form of a city council meeting where a man who had not read the packet declared that public health was a scam perpetuated by people who liked statistics too much and washing too little. Leah sat in the row behind me and wrote in her notebook in a large hotel pen, breathe, and turned the page and wrote, do not make a speech with metaphors about lungs, and turned the page and wrote, I know you and love you but do not. I behaved because she was right. I said my three sentences into the mic like I was telling a teenager the rules about hall passes, then sat down and let a grandmother with a cane and an aura of competence do the real work. She said, “I raise three children and two grandchildren; if you make shots harder to get, I will come to your house and explain herd immunity at a decibel your wife will not enjoy,” and the man who had not read the packet put his eyes on his hands as if they were a novel.

The block-number messages continued, less frequent but not gone. They wore their practicality like a disguise. Check the seam in the heel. Stairs are a lie, corners are not. Keep your eyes in front of your chest when you don’t trust your knees. They bothered me less when I did not have the capacity to be bothered and more when I did. I sent each to Ed or Arden or, if it seemed too small to be a lawsuit and still too big to ignore, to Roz, who kept a file and a mood. I told Tomas as much as he would tolerate hearing about a person trying to be his competitor in the category of my spine’s conscience, and he took the book with the margin notes and read it through twice and then wrote in his own hand on the title page, You are not raised by angels; you are raised by floors. He gave it back to me without comment as if returning a borrowed cup.

Thursday brought a patient who carried a brown paper bag as if it held a small animal. It did not. It held all her medications, unlabeled because the labels made her feel watched. She said the names of them like pets that had displeased her. We did the thing where you itemize a life and try to put possibilities in order. When we were done she reached into the bag again and brought out a folded piece of paper and set it on my knee with the tenderness of someone delivering a fragile hope. It was a cutout from the newspaper with my stupid face on it and the words local doctor dances that Leah had made rude with a highlighter star. The bottom right corner had a note in block letters that were not the block letters, softer, rounder, a child’s block hand grown up. It said simply, I liked the part where you stopped and breathed. I looked up and her eyes were doing the wet thing eyes do when they decide not to. She said, “I forget,” and I said, “Me too,” and we told each other we would try different.

Elise called in the late afternoon to say that a ninth-grader had written a poem about Captain and wanted to read it at the next social, and that she had told the kid to email Roz, and that she was prepared to defend the artistic merit of rodents to a trustee if necessary. She added, after a pause that I could hear her fill with a hum so her voice would land right, “You are tired in that way where your spine behaves like an honest man at a bad party. Can we drill and not argue today.”

“Yes,” I said, an agreement and a gratitude in one syllable. “Basics and then nothing fancy. I want to earn the right to lie to myself about the diagonals later.”

In Studio B that evening, the new piece came toward us with the permission that only arrives when you stop chasing. It was not timid and it was not proud; it expected attention but not worship. We worked the place in the middle where the music went patient and we had wanted to hurry. We stayed. We let the breath become a count without letting the count become a rule we resented. Tomas watched, then looked away not because he was bored but because he wanted the room to decide what to do with us without his eyelashes. When we finished, he said, “Good. This one will make judges argue with themselves later about whether they like conscientious spines or rude ones. It will be amusing. You may never hear the end of it.”

Sebastian came in during the last twenty minutes with his dog on a leash, a dog who looked like a gentleman and a vacuum cleaner had been combined and come out perfect. Roz raised an eyebrow so pointed he apologized in advance, then produced proof of vaccination for the dog that included a mugshot in which the dog looked bored and philosophical. He claimed he was there to pay for his rented studio hours and then, as if the truth had to be told before it ruined his skin, said, “Also, I got mailed a shell,” and handed Roz a small envelope with a flourish he regretted. Inside, on a bed of dealer false velvet, sat one sunflower shell and a business card without a business but with a single letter stamped on it in an old-fashioned typeface: C.

Roz held the card between her fingers like a detective and a woman who organizes Halloween at the same time. “He is diversifying,” she said. “Or she is. Or they are. Or the Goblin has figured out mail. Either way, the jar gets a cousin in which I put items collected as evidence of humans being both sentimental and invasive. Hector, get me a jar that does not look like it used to hold spaghetti sauce. This will not be a marinara of rage; this will be a reliquary.”

“Are we being hazed,” Sebastian asked, not entirely joking. “Is there an initiation for people who take floors personally.”

“You’re already in,” Elise said, not unkind and not entirely forgiving either. “This is what it’s like. Floors want what they want and people want to help you want it and sometimes they forget to ask if you asked them to.”

On Friday I had clinic until two and then promised myself a nap I was not going to take. Leah left me a thermos of coffee with salt like Emme’s from the times when she wanted to put an arm around my head and couldn’t because we were doing medicine. Mr. Ingersoll came in with his cardigan mended and announced that his joy was currently on a yellow sticky because his fridge had eaten his notebook and he was not in the mood to argue with an appliance. He said he had watched the clip of our Seattle thing twice and then turned it off because he wanted to see it again later with a drink in his hand and not with a dry mouth. He said, “Your partner’s face makes me want to sit up. Your face makes me want to go for a walk and not tell anyone I went until I get back,” and I wrote that on a napkin and stuck it to the inside of my brain for days when it would help.

The nap did not happen. I drove to the studio with my eyes doing that scratchy protest and thought, I am too old for this, which is untrue and unhelpful, and then thought, I am too young not to try, which was also untrue and also unhelpful and made me laugh. The parking lot held puddles like coins. A kid from Elise’s school was attempting a turn in the reflection in the window and almost fell into a family arguing cheerfully about whether pizza was a food group. I unlocked the cabinet and took out my bag and found, under the towel that had become our message board, a postcard tucked with the radical manners of a person who thinks intimacy is partly postal and partly timing. It was a picture of a bridge in Seattle, the one my mother refuses to cross, and on the back, the same patient block letters: You did not apologize with your back this time. Keep not. Don’t outrun quiet. — C.

I read it twice and then did the thing I have learned to do which is breathe all the way down to where my body keeps its rage and its gratitude like neighbors and tell both to keep their voices down. I took a photograph. I sent it to the small circle in which we place things we are not yet wise about. Ed responded an hour later with, I’ve forwarded this to a person whose hobby is being correct for a living, and Roz wrote, I have added “Do Not Outrun Quiet” to the bathroom wall where we put sentences that make showers holy, and Elise wrote, fine, but we are not meeting your friend without a chaperone and pepper spray and a sense of our own worth. I put the card in the jar and went to basics.

We had the choice to make the new piece about gentleness weaponized or about weaponry that remembered to be gentle; we chose the latter because we are who we are. Elise decided, mid-drill, that she wanted to learn a particular turn the old-fashioned way, which is to say slowly and with a vow against theatrics. She refused to let me help until the point where help would be partnership and not interference. Her hair, which does what it wants when invited but hates to be told, escaped the careful clip and hung in a line like punctuation at her neck; she pushed it back with a movement that I would have sworn was choreographed if I had not seen her do it while telling a ninth-grader he could tell the truth and still be loved. I watched and I did not hover and I reminded my hands that keeping her safe is not the same as making her small. Tomas, who has a radar for the borders between help and control, nodded and pretended to check his email.

By Sunday the studio had been put back into order. The lockers stood in a line like soldiers who had been told to do good and not die. One of them was pink enough to raise the dead. Roz had placed a label maker on the front desk and a teenager with handwriting like branches had been placed in charge of temporary names for people who did not yet trust themselves with permanence. The jar on the sill held its ridiculous little moons. Captain left no shells and much attitude.

Late that afternoon, after we had both decided to call practice before the point where nothing could be improved without being broken and after Roz had sent us home like children who had earned their exhaustion, I stopped at the co-op near my apartment to buy vegetables my mother would approve of and then, for balance, a block of cheese that could silence God. In the parking lot, under a sky that had the courtesy to pretend to be indifferent, I felt the small cold-lipped kiss of being watched and remembered I am an animal and not a metaphor. I turned, not quickly, because predators like that, and saw, twenty feet away, a person holding a phone at that angle people use when they wish to pretend not to be taking a picture. They wore a jacket the color of boiled beets and a hat that wanted to be a disguise. The posture was not dangerous so much as intent. I felt my neck get taller. I felt my hand go to my pocket where there is nothing useful and everything important.

“Can I help you,” I said, not loud and not quiet because either would be an invitation to a different game. The person looked, not caught, but revised, like someone who had to change a plan mid-stitch and was good at sewing. They lowered the phone with an exaggerated courtesy and said, “Sorry. You’re the doctor who dances. My sister follows you. She likes the mouse,” and the last sentence was spoken in that stranger’s tone that makes the world both hilarious and impossible. I nodded and kept my body where it was and my voice the register that does not start fights. “Tell your sister to bring cash to the next Goblin Gala,” I said, and they laughed, like a door closing with care, and walked away.

The next day, in the clinic, I learned a new method for not letting my shoulders live where my ears belong. A woman with three jobs and a laugh like a door hinge told me that she had watched our video in between shifts and had practiced the promenade in her kitchen and spilled coffee on her long-suffering cat. She said she didn’t write down her joy because she didn’t have a piece of paper, and I told her about Mr. Ingersoll’s fridge and she said, “I do not argue with appliances,” and I said, “Neither do I; I raise my eyebrows at them gently until they behave.” She left with a plan and four prescriptions and the kind of determination that would, frankly, rather we kept our hands where she could see them. After, Leah put one of Emme’s cookies on my desk with the note, This is to bribe your angels into unionizing, and I laughed and ate it because I am a man with boundaries but not about sugar.

Near the end of that week, the detective Ed had connected us to called and asked me to come in if I had ten minutes to meet his eye. He was the kind of cop whose desk has more plants than paperwork, which made me feel weirdly safe. He showed me photographs in dull colors: the postcard, the envelope with Sebastian’s shell, a screen grab of a blocked number’s reputation that did not cheer me. He asked me the questions I had already asked myself and a few I had not. Did anyone from your childhood write their letters like that. Did anyone at the studio favor old-school stationery. Did you ever throw a shell at a classmate and call it a gift. I said no to all but one, which made him grin, because there had been a shell once in third grade and I had been the kind of child who believed that if something looked like a boat it could carry grief.

He said, “This person does not like phones unless they can pretend the phone is not part of their face. This person believes they can pre-own your gratitude. This person threatens in the dulled way of someone who used to be good at something,” and then, seeing my spine respond, added, “They have not crossed it yet, but they like the line. Tell me if they do. Leave bags in a locker. Introduce me to Roz so I can ask her to glare for me because she will do it with more moral authority than my badge.” I liked him. He liked Roz on sight later, which made me trust him further. He told Captain’s story back to himself while looking at the vending machine with a professional vigilance that probably spends most of its days on humans.

Elise and I did the thing that I think is the secret to either art or survival: we kept showing up. We put our bodies in the place where muscles remember and improved the smallest degree we had promised ourselves we would. We argued about trivialities at a volume that would not disturb the dead and important things at a volume that would not scare the living. We sent each other images of bridges and mice and the way a city looks when it is pretending to be unbothered. When I apologized for forgetting to eat before a late practice, she told me in a tone no less sacred for being practical, “Do not starve the part of you that carries me,” and it landed in my chest like a note slid under a door by a person who knows the house.

Two Sundays later, we drove out to the coast to teach a workshop someone had requested on a whim and then accidentally funded. The sky over Highway 26 had the particular drama of a god with a temper and decent timing. The trees did the dark crowding thing they do when they are preparing to let the ocean in. Elise built a playlist that involved violins and drums and exactly one pop song so we would not become priests. We played the part of people who know both more and less than the room expects. The community center gym was linoleum and memory; it smelled like sneakers and the end of dodgeball. A dozen couples showed up holding hands and opinions, and two teenagers who had lied to their aunt about their homework and were going to get away with it, and an older gentleman with a boutonniere like a joke and a flair for dramatic pauses. We taught weight shift and breathing and the refusal to hurry and then, because we were asked and because it would have been rude not to, we showed the middle of the new piece without saying its name.

After, a woman with sea-air hair and a sweater that had learned to respect the wind approached me with the quiet authority of a person who knows all the answers to the town crossword. She said, “You don’t know me but I know your mother because we all know everyone’s mother here,” and then, without pause because the point was to keep me from deflecting, “There is a person down the street who leaves shells on people’s porches when their kids play too loud. There is a person in every town who believes intimacy can be borrowed if they say something true in block letters. They cause casseroles and locks. They stop when you make them.” I said, because she had earned the question and because I wanted to carry her clarity home like driftwood, “How do you make them,” and she said, “Look them in the face and say, out loud, ‘You do not live here,’” and then she smiled that dangerous sweet smile old women wear when they are done being polite, and added, “It also helps to buy a motion sensor.”

We stopped at the beach for thirty minutes on the way back, because to be that close to salt and not look at it would have been indecent. The ocean made an argument for persistence that I could not refute. Elise took off her shoes and walked to the line where the water flirted with the sand and then left, like a careful suitor. I stood without being inevitably sucked toward metaphor and watched the horizon make itself and unmake itself, which is a trick I could do with my day if I’m not careful. Before we got in the car, a gull regarded me with judgment and I told it, “We are not leaving snacks,” and it screamed laughter with the voice of a god who gets jokes.

When we returned to Beaverton, my apartment smelled like the lemon oil my mother had sent me the year before I learned how to stop letting mail pile into shame. On the floor by the door, under the mat I sometimes forget to straighten, there was a single shell. It did not come with a note. It did not come with block letters. It sat there like a punctuation mark you didn’t ask for but cannot ignore. I picked it up and held it in my hand and made myself breathe until my body caught up to my decision. I set it on the counter. I walked out to the hall where my neighbor was arguing amicably with a stroller, and I said, too loudly and just for me, “You do not live here.” The hall did not laugh and the shell did not answer and for one second I felt ridiculous and then I felt better.

I texted Elise: shell at my door. said the line the sea woman taught me. felt foolish and human. she wrote back: both is the assignment. also i bought pepper spray that smells like cinnamon and guilt. Also, your detective friend used the phrase “pattern of encroachment” which Roz has now printed on a T-shirt.

The next week, a letter arrived at the studio with a stamp that made Roz snort at its effort. Inside was a typed note on thin paper that smelled faintly of talc. It said, in a voice that was trying to be old and precious and did not quite pull it off, that the sender delighted in our art and in our awareness of corners and that we would no doubt be less nice when it mattered because we had learned not to be. It was signed C in ink and the ink had bled slightly, the way ink does when the pen is cheap or someone’s hand is damp. Roz, who is forensic when given a reason, held the paper up to the light and said, “Pharmacy pad,” with derision. I wanted to laugh and we did. We gave it to the detective and to Ed and to our jar because if a thing deserved to be ridiculous, it should at least be ridiculous in good company.

We kept making the dance. We kept making two kinds of room. We kept arguing with ourselves and with gravity and losing and winning in the correct proportions. The note from the judge about our diagonals started to feel like the kind of sentence you can stand on and not just look at. Tomas lectured me one evening about knees with the intensity of a man who had allowed himself fewer mistakes than I had and pulled two more degrees out of my hips like a loan I could afford. Elise showed up one Thursday with a bruise the size of a tangerine on her thigh from telling a locker to stop being stupid, and she said, “I am very sexy in the way furniture movers are fancy,” and I loved her for it and told her so. Roz installed the last of the locks and posted a polite note by the jar that said: WE HAVE REACHED OUR LOCKER GOAL. PLEASE CONTINUE TO THROW MONEY AT US BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE DRAMA QUEENS AND SO ARE CHILDREN.

At clinic, Leah told me she’d been offered a job in a place with thinner walls and better pay and could I imagine a world in which she might leave. I did not. I told her I would respect anything she did and then went to my office and put my head down for thirty seconds and did not cry in the way men in my family express grief, which is to stand like a coat rack and pretend to admire the paint. She came in while I was performing stoicism and put her hand on my shoulder and said, “I am not going,” and I said, “Good,” and then, because both of us know medicine is a building that collapses if we do not beam it with people, I added, “If you do, I will ask you to take me with you,” and she said, “That was the right answer,” and left a granola bar on my desk that had the caloric density of an apology.

On a Wednesday night, late, when the studio was empty in the polite way buildings empty when you’ve asked them to and not in the tragic way, I went back to do thirty minutes alone. The new piece had a hitch in the middle I thought I could befriend in solitude. The room took me the way water takes someone who knows how to float and also how to kick. I ran the part where you tell your ribs to act like adults and not like cousins at a wedding. At the end of a pass I heard a soft, precise sound like a tiny cough. I froze, which is unhelpful in art and survival and sometimes unavoidable. In the mirror, at the baseboard by the bungee, he watched me. He is not a metaphor and I refuse to make him one, and yet there he was, as if my insistence on keeping certain things separate was a game he could win when bored. He sat on his haunches and did a thing that made me laugh even while being unnerved: he yawned, an open, ridiculous rodent yawn, and then, as if insulted by my involvement in his life, disappeared.

I stood alone in the room and practiced saying new sentences out loud. “You do not live here,” I said, and then, so the part of me that loves and the part that defends could call truce for a second, “But you belong here in the way wild things belong where there are corners and heat,” and if that made me foolish it made me less afraid. I put my bag in the locker. I stretched. I left the studio with the sense that the building had not owed me anything and had given me something anyway.

The invitation for another event arrived the next day with a subject line that said simply: Bridges. It was a small festival in a town further south that wanted to claim both coast and culture. They had heard about Seattle in the way towns hear, and wanted to mine our piece for grit. Elise read the email aloud while using a pair of scissors on a ribbon that had wronged her. “We can’t keep saying yes,” she said, and then added, “We also can’t keep pretending saying yes is our sin,” and I said, “I will ask Emme to be violent with my calendar,” and Elise said, “Good, she is my favorite version of authority,” and we circled the date with a pencil in the air.

That evening, my mother sent me a link to a video about mice in ancient theaters and wrote, in the body of the email like a person who still honors the idea of the letter, “The Romans thought a mouse crossing the stage was an omen for whether an actor would forget his lines. They were wrong about many things; they were right that animals don’t owe us their symbolism. Call me when the rain stops or when it gets interesting again.” I called and we argued about whether the sound the new kettle made was ethical and whether she should grow rosemary on her windowsill like a cliché, and she told me that Lolly thinks my neck is too long for my profession and that is why she worries. When I hung up, I laughed out loud in a room that acted like it hadn’t asked for my laughter and then kept it anyway.

When the next text came from the blocked number, the words were less like instructions and more like a line of poetry that had accidentally dined out. It said, simply, Quiet can be an argument. Use it with teeth. The hand that had written the postcards was in it somewhere, but something had shifted: the person composing had been made to listen to someone besides themselves. I took a photograph. I sent it to the circle. Ed wrote back, “I am bored of them and yet compelled. This is rude of my brain. We will continue to put names on doors. We will not feed any animals but ours.” Roz wrote, “Teeth merch coming soon; don’t be mad,” and sent a picture of a shirt that read KEEP YOUR TEETH, in a font that did not make me itchy. Elise wrote, “Bring it into the studio as a dare and not as medicine,” and I did.

That weekend, Leah made me pancakes in her kitchen like the cousin I only recognize in some lights. Her daughter, who is learning to do math as if it’s a language for people she doesn’t like yet, told me I wasn’t allowed to leave until I had watched her do a cartwheel in the yard and said, “Not terrible,” which is her highest praise. Leah put food into me with so much love disguised as bossiness that it would have gotten messy if I had been less hungry. She asked me if I was sleeping and I lied and she let me, just for that morning, because sometimes generosity looks like pretending to believe a person so they can rest in the sentence.

I went to the studio that afternoon with syrup in my veins and a vow to be less noble about loneliness. The jar on the sill had an extra shell. There was no note. The pink locker gleamed like a threat to sadness. Captain did not appear. We drilled. We did not hurry. We made a choice in the middle to take a breath and to show it. We made the floor understand us. We were less nice and more bite and not cruel. We were not owed any of it and we didn’t act like we were. The rain shut itself off for an hour then and the world made that noise it makes when it is surprised into being quiet. We didn’t outrun it. We learned how to stand inside it without apologizing. We learned, slowly, stupidly, well, how to carry it from one room to another without spilling.
