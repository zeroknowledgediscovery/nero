Rain had fallen in a thin hush over Bath since the small hours, more a veil than a storm, softening the honeyed stone and turning the pavements slick as black ribbon. Corporal Nathan Lark walked up from the river toward the Abbey with his hood down—he liked the drizzle; it threaded into his hair and made the city smell like limescale and old books. On Walcot he stopped to look into the window of a charity shop and caught his own reflection, hunched and taller than he remembered from the last time he’d gone out without a cover or a pack. The sign in the window was flaking gold leaf: Furniture, Linen, Treasures. His face framed by doilies. He grinned—ridiculous—and his grin looked back like he’d won something.

He had, though. That morning a message had come, short and disbelieving. They’d put his name through to the final. Our final, he corrected himself, because it wasn’t just Nathan Lark who got him here. It was his left ankle, mended twice in the desert and still clicking when the air went damp. It was the spare afternoons in the drill hall when the lads tired of circuits and he put on a playlist he’d stole from some radio show and coaxed Rhys into a jive. Soul like a knotted rope. Callus on callus, and yet. His body was remembering something older than the service, older than Bath or Abbey bells—his Gran’s kitchen where the lino was worn to paper and she’d lift him and laugh and swing him around, two steps and a turn, two steps, turn, a lullaby of steam and scraping kettle. Nathan, she’d said, you’ll never fall if you’re listening.

He stepped back from the glass and nearly collided with Eva, who came out of the bakery next door with an apron in dabs of flour. She had a tray balanced against one hip and a look in her eye that was either mischief or the beginnings of a telling-off.

"Thought you’d be in bed," she said. "Not fossicking through other people’s secrets."

"You always make me sound like a petty thief," Nathan said. He dodged as she tried to dab her floury wrist against his cheek. "You heard?"

"I heard," she said, softer. "Nate. Oh Nate." The tray rattled as she put it down on an upturned milk crate and hugged him, bread-scented and fierce. "The final. Fancy it, our Bath boy in the big lights."

"It’s in London," he said, as if that mattered, as if the city were a character who’d have a say. "They’ve pushed it up. Next Saturday."

"You’ve got time to tart yourself up by then. Get you a proper haircut, not this hedgehog under hedge scenario you’re cultivating."

"It’s a regulation hedge," he said, laughing. "I asked Sarge, he measured it with that ruler he keeps for despair."

"And your partner? That redhead in the leopard shoes, what’s her name. She the one who nearly took your head off with a spin?"

"Lina," he said, "and no, that was rehearsed. Mostly."

"You know I can’t watch the show on the floor," Eva said. "Too much to think about when you do that knee-thing. But I watch it after, on my phone, and the girls at the bakery do all the weeping for me."

"You’ll be there, though. For the final."

"As if I'd miss it." She bent to pick up the tray and he took it from her, because soldier reflex or big brother or both. "Mum’s already making a banner. She’s got glitter on the cat."

Nathan swung the bakery door open for her. Warmth and yeast breathed out. On the radio in the corner a woman sang in Welsh, crisp, like a river with stones in it. The baker-boy, Kian, lifted a palm covered in flour and grinned with half his mouth. The baker gals did fake catwalks with baguettes. Someone had left a stack of postcards on the counter—Bath Abbey drawn in soft graphite—and someone else had written in the margins: ALWAYS BE YOUR OWN AUDIENCE. He tucked his chin to hide a suddenly stupid smile.

"You’ll come by for lunch," Eva said, already at work, already pulling trays and cutting new dough into fast obedient soldiers. The word hung in the air without meaning to and she flinched as she saw his face shift. "Sorry."

"It’s fine," Nathan said. It was fine. He’d trained his jaw not to clench when someone used the word like a utensil for eggs. "I’ll be back. I’ve got to make a call."

He was a mile into it when he turned his phone back on in the rain and sat on a stone bench near the Parade Gardens, where tourists took pictures in summer and dogs chased tennis balls like small green angels. The call connected him to a production coordinator with a sweet voice and an edge like broken ceramic.

"We’re absolutely delighted," she said. "You’ve had such a—journey. Can I say that? It’s a bit of a cliché but there we are. The public loves your face. How’s the ankle?"

"It’s attached."

"Good enough," she said briskly. "We’ve got a few segments planned. There’s a package on you taking Lina to see the Crescent. And a satellite link for the barracks, if you can manage it. And—oh—one more thing." Her voice changed, brightened. "We’ve got a presenter for the final. Big surprise for our boy from Bath. I can tell you, but you must pretend I didn’t. Strictly hush."

"I can pretend to be surprised," he said. He’d been pretending to be fine for so many years he could cry on exact cue.

"Mara Vale," she said. "She’s doing the sponsor’s tie-in and she insisted on the dance final. You met her, didn’t you, at the Remembrance Gala? There are pictures of you two being charming on a staircase."

Nathan let the name slide through him like a flat stone skips water. Mara Vale. Face on billboards and bus shelters and flight safety videos. Laugh big as a summer storm. He had been introduced to her at the Gala and she’d threaded her hand into the crook of his elbow as if they were cousins—or conspirators—and said, "Private Lark. I’m trying to work out how you got away with a name like that without becoming a singer."

"Corporal, ma’am," he’d said, because he’s always himself about the little things. "And you’re thinking of a nightingale, probably. I’m more of a crow."

"Crows remember faces," she replied, and he had laughed, and she had kissed the air next to his cheek and smelled like lemon and something cold, like rain on a stone windowsill.

"She remembers?" he asked the coordinator, stupidly.

"The pictures got good numbers," the coordinator said, meaning clicks and eyes and the timer on an app that watched the nation breathe. "So. Can we book you for a pre-record on Wednesday? And we’ll send a car for you on Saturday morning. Don’t be late; we live for you and we will die if you are late."

"Brutal," he said.

"It’s show business," she answered, then softened. "Congratulations, Nathan. It’s not a fluke. You’re good. Don’t tell anyone I said that, I have a reputation."

He hung up and then didn’t move, because sometimes the city seemed to tilt, and he had learned what to do when the ground behaved like a ship: hands on knees, breathe, let the rocking turn into ordinary sway again. Be a tree. Be the only tree on a plain and pretend the wind is a choice. He looked at the river, muddied and heavy with rain, and then turned and looked at the bridge with its shallow, graceful shops hanging like earrings over the water. Pulteney’s curve, drawn with a kind of sunny confidence two hundred years ago.

He took out his phone again and scrolled through the pictures of that Gala. He hadn’t taken them, and he didn’t fit in them as if he’d been pasted in after, a sticker, not a boy. In one, he and Mara were on the stairs with gold-trimmed carpet and she was laughing, mouth wide open, head back, all that silly hair like a halo spun out of thread. He was looking at her like he was drinking, like a thirsty dog at a bowl. He remembered later that a journalist had asked him something about her, and he had said something with the creamy caution of a private man: she’s kind, she’s... cleverer than they put on. She wrote him a note that he’d never thrown away, curved in black ink: If you dance for them, dance for you twice. I saw you listening. M x.

He sent a message to Lina: They want the Crescent on Wednesday. Bring trainers and your angry face.

Lina sent back a dancing avocado and a string of expletives about her day job, which involved spreadsheets and a man named Felton who insisted on talking to her in a voice he reserved for women he thought were fainting goats.

Nathan put the phone in his pocket and got up, because sitting still when the blood is buzzing is a sort of voluntary torture. The pump room clock struck the quarter; the bells sounded like teacups bumping into each other. He started walking, and on the other side of the road a man leaned against a lamppost and watched him.

Just a man, you say. Just a bloke in a waterproof with his hood up, making a phone call and studying the town. That was what Nathan told himself, and what he’d learned to tell himself when the paranoia had filed its teeth sharp and tried to gnaw him hollow. He walked, and the man did not follow him, and the rain slowed and held its breath. There were mobile phone stalls on the corner near the bus station, and a boy doing wheelies on a bicycle, and two tourists laughing because the map app had turned them in a circle. He turned up past the Abbey and into the narrow street that would take him home to his mother’s little house with its blue door that had swallowed more keys than a magician’s hat, and thought: remember this. The timing of things. Rain, phone call, man with a hood, the taste of bread in the air. Because later, afterwards, that is what he would not be able to retrieve except as fragments.

When he opened the blue door, his mother was on a stool and the cat was on the table wearing glitter like a constellation. "Don’t you dare say anything," she said, without turning. "He wanted to help."

"He’s a cat," Nathan told her. "He doesn’t want anything but to judge us and sleep on clean laundry."

Mum pointed with a pair of scissors. She’d cut the glitter paper into a forest of stars and letters; the air tasted of glue that would never come fully off the table. "For your big night," she said, voice very light. "Look at this. I’ve made the A wrong."

"It’s perfect," he said, kissing the crown of her head, hair dry as straw. "It’s an Art Nouveau A."

"It’s a drunk A," she said, and smiled. "Your grandfather would have loved this. He’d have come with his harmonica and got himself thrown out for blowing in the wrong places."

"He got thrown out of his own wedding," Nathan reminded her. "For singing You Are My Sunshine while you were still in the aisle."

"He wanted to make sure everyone understood the brief," Mum said. "Anyway. London. I don’t like London; it eats you. But we’ll go. The whole old lot of us, family and ragamuffins. Your cousin Elise says she’ll bring the baby, which the show will hate and also love."

"You don’t need to come if you don’t want to," he said. "It’s just a room where people clap and some lights and my ankle squeals."

"If my son is going to put himself under glass," she said, "I will be there to tap, tap, tap. And to bring sandwiches, because I’ve seen the price of the little squares of cheese at those events. Cheeky devils."

He looked beyond her at the living room where the mantel had accumulated photographs of things that were, in total, a family. Eva with a pie the size of her head. The old labrador, Gideon, who had gone into the ground last year and taken with him a certain squeaking door-spring happiness. Nathan at twelve with a skateboard and a nose like a battering ram. Gran in a floral dress with a waist like a wasp and a laugh crinkled like tissue.

"You still dance with your ghost girlfriend?" Mum asked, and he blinked.

"Which one is that?"

"The one that lives in your head," she said. "The music you hear when it’s quiet. I see you with your feet on the tiles and the kettle going. Don’t pretend you don’t."

He leaned against the doorframe and looked down at his hands. He had broken the little finger on the right hand three years ago, in a bar fight he didn’t start, and now it sat just a bit crooked, like a guest too shy to come fully into the room. "Gran taught me," he said. "She started on twos and threes and then decided I deserved a six. I suppose it’s there whether I try or not."

"That is a good way of putting it," Mum said. "That’s the music, love. It isn’t something you make. It’s something that finds you because you’re listening. Don’t let the television people pretend it’s their trick."

Later, after he had eaten a sandwich at Eva’s and then another because Kian produced cold cuts with the solemnity of a ceremony, Nathan went to a studio he used sometimes in a space above a carpet warehouse on Kingsmead. The wood floor had seen everything and told no one: ballet and a birthday party and a fight and a child sliding across it in socks like an otter and, twice, a wedding waltz in trainers because the groom had lost his shoes.

Lina was late by the measure of the clock and exactly on time by the measure of her life. She burst in with a gym bag and a curse and hair in a bun that would have outlived a mild earthquake.

"Felton," she said, in the tone of a hex. "Felton thought he could tell me what to do by putting his hand on the back of my chair and talking down at me like I was mid-table furniture. I said, 'Felton, my love, if you put your hand on my chair again we will both learn something about velocity and Newton.’"

Nathan grinned. "Can I borrow you that sentence for when the show runner gets handsy with my schedule?"

"Anything for our boy," she said, then saw his face, and the grin, and the little breath held behind it like a child looking out a window at snow. "You got the call."

"I got the call."

Lina was Polish by birth and Bath by stubbornness and she never did anything halfway. She jumped on him with a whoop and he caught her without thinking and his ankle said nothing about it, which was either nice or the calm before a complaint. She blew air kisses around his jaw and then let go and snapped a hairband on her wrist with a declaration that would have stripped paint.

"Mara Vale," he said, and she dropped her bag.

"Oh she is so... what’s the word. Dangerous."

"To who?"

"To herself," Lina said. "All that glitter falls back down. But also to men who think they can see through. You will be nice to her. Not because she is famous—pffff." She actually made the pffff noise like air from a sofa cushion. "Because she is a person. And she will be frightened, and I know that face, all the famous women have it. It is a flinch you don’t know you do."

"You know famous women now?"

Lina gave him a look that made a mockery of the question. "I know women. Come, you lanky beautiful idiot. Let’s see if your heel remembers the tango."

They danced until the windows steamed and the wood floor darkened where their shoes bit in, and the music rose and fell in loops of something with an old piano and a rhythm like someone tapping on the underside of a table. His chest hurt, the good kind of hurt, the clear pain of lungs opening to something they didn’t know they held. They had to pause because Nathan’s shirt had decided to turn into a wet rag and Lina’s hair had given up its structural ambitions and was living its life on her neck.

"I like you best when you are tired," she said, without malice. "It flattens your stubborn."

"I don’t have stubborn," he said, in a tone entirely composed of stubborn.

"We will go to London. We will take the train with cut sandwiches and a readiness to be disappointed. You will not be disappointed," she corrected herself. "You will do what you do."

He thought of the man with the hood, and the way you could conjure danger out of nothing, gifts out of thin air. He and Lina danced again with their shoes whispering on the floor, and when they stepped out onto the street the rain had stopped and the sky had found a new color, something like pewter lit from behind. Nathan watched a bus go by with Mara Vale’s face on it, her lipstick like a story, and his chest did that little jump that you could pretend was indigestion if someone asked.

If you dance for them, dance for you twice. He could be two men. He already had been on occasion, and it hadn’t killed him yet.

The week unspooled in a series of bright and small catastrophes, like beads falling from a broken string that you keep catching and pocketing until you look down and find your hands full. The pre-record at the Crescent meant he had to twirl on cobbles that had been polished by four centuries of footsteps until he thought he might skate into history and crack his brains on it. A tourist in a blue puffer coat took pictures and then asked him to photograph her with Lina because she said they looked like siblings and it would be cute, and Lina, who had never been called cute on purpose in her life, narrowed her eyes and then saw that the woman meant no harm and softened, because people deserve to be wrong sometimes.

At the barracks, Sergeant Hesketh stood with his arms folded and a desire not to be on camera readable in his eyebrows, and then when they rolled, his face did an entirely different thing, a brightness that moved over it like an electric kettle switching on, and he said something that made Nathan want to go into a cupboard and be small for an hour. "We’re proud," the man said. "Don’t tell him that, it will go to his head and he’ll be unable to get through the door. But we are, and that means he has to clean the canteen for a month because none of us can live with his swagger."

They all laughed and Nathan wiped his eyes off-camera and hated himself for crying in a stupid way that made him look like someone whose emotions turned on and off like a tap. He felt the dry hands of one of the lads on his neck, then a squeeze, not a hug because that was illegal in daylight. They worked with what they had.

In the evening, when he walked home, there was sometimes a car idling with its lights off near the corner by the butcher’s. It might have been someone waiting to pick up a teenager. It might have been someone arguing on a phone and forgetting the bulbs were burning. It might have been nothing. He told himself: nothing, nothing. He went into the house with the blue door and ate stew and let the cat, starry, choose him as a sleeping surface.

On Friday, he went to the studio alone because Lina had to deal with Felton and something called a pivot table, which sounded like the sort of instrument you might use to measure hope. He keyed in the code that stuck sometimes and went up the treads of stairs two at a time because his legs had not learned caution, only rehearsal. He turned on the lights.

His reflection in the long mirror had the look he hated and loved: a bit too open, as if the face were an envelope someone had steamed. He moved to the music he played low because he wanted the room to make him work for it, and he didn’t hear the door open, which was unlike him. When the voice came from the back of the room trying to be soft and ending up with amusement around the edges, he turned like a soldier on parade.

"Don’t shoot," the voice said. "I brought coffee."

Mara Vale had the gift and the curse of being seen anywhere she went—from the back of a carriage, in a hat, in a video with bad lighting, in an unflattering jacket—and still being her, unmistakeable. She was dressed as if she had looked at an outfit and then scolded it for a minute, then softened. Black jeans, a sweater that had cost more than Nathan’s cooker, trainers built for running from adoration. She carried two coffees and a bag that had the edges of pastry grease showing through, and her grin was apologetic, a girl who had burst into the wrong class at uni and was not going to leave.

"I shouldn’t have come without a person to chaperone me," she said, stepping up with that boldness that pretends it isn’t afraid. "The production person will tell me off. I’m trying to avoid being told off by grown-ups. Always have. Hello, Corporal Lark."

"Nathan," he said, and it came out low, because the part of him that did “not starstruck, never” had left the room to have a cigarette and consider how badly it had failed. "Hi. We’re—this is—"

"A room with a floor and a mirror and the smell of too much effort," she said, inhaling like a pilgrim at a well. "I started in rooms like this. Before the cameras. Before craft services, darling." She handed him a coffee and something warm in paper. "It’s a treat to see one again without a man with a clipboard counting my exhales."

"It’s weird," he managed. "Seeing you here. I thought—Saturday. At the thing."

"So did I," she said lightly. "I was in the neighborhood. And by neighborhood I mean Bristol and a car with the moral character of a teabag. But I prefer this. I wanted to see the person, not the packaging." She looked at him straight on, eyes not soft or hard but accurate. "May I?"

"What?" he said, addiction to monosyllables thick in his tongue.

"Invite myself to a small dance," she said. "Only if it’s not weird. It’s probably weird. I won’t tell if you won’t."

They put the coffees down. She kicked off her shoes with the grim acceptance of someone who has known both stilettos and hiking boots and found both wanting. He put on a track he used for the cool-down, something piano with a smoky drag, and they stood facing each other like the beginning of a language lesson.

"You know," she said, as he lifted her hand, "I’m terrible at being led. In life."

"Noted," he said. "Do you want to? Lead."

"Not today," she said. "Trust me. I spend too much of my time being the boss of nothing. I’d like to do the opposite. Sir."

"You don’t have to—"

"Shut up," she said, smiling. "You can be good and I can be tired. That’s allowed." They moved, and she listened, and he did as he’d been told long ago in a kitchen with lino and steam. He listened to her weight, where it wanted to be. She was better than she pretended; her laugh made little loops around his ear. They were not a couple. They were two people who had happened to find a step that the other person knew.

She looked over his shoulder once and her mouth did a quirk. "You’ve got shadows on your doorstep," she said, soft.

"What?"

"Men," she said, shrugging. "Maybe there for a vape and a sulk. Maybe not. I get used to identifying a sort of—texture—in a day. It helps not to die of foolishness."

Nathan felt that cold run up his back that made his hair feel individually alive. He let her go and walked to the window with the caution of someone circling a badger. The car was there again, the one from earlier in the week, a dark hatchback, not new. He saw movement behind the windscreen. Maybe it was all in the timing. Maybe the city was a theater and everyone rehearsed in front of everyone else.

"You dancing in London," she said, in a normal voice like the moment hadn’t folded, "is going to make someone phone their mum and say sorry. That’s the sort of thing it does to people. You wouldn’t believe the letters I get. They pour all of the things they can’t say to the right person into me." She took a breath. "It’s heavy, sometimes. None of them know my kitchen is full of unwashed dishes like a crime scene because I am working too much and trying too hard and then I drop things."

"I might," he said.

"And you?" she said. "Do you get letters?"

"From blokes who think dancing is... a betrayal. From girls who think it’s... a gauntlet. From my auntie who says I am standing wrong, which is true."

"And from soldiers," she said, because she knew where to put the pin. "The ones with ankles and nights and rooms with no air."

"Sometimes," he said.

She looked at him with something like caution and then reached out and touched the twist in his finger. "I’m not flirting," she said, and then laughed at herself. "I mean, how do you not. Look at us. Made of bone and nerve and disaster. I mean: I’m not being unkind with it. I don’t want a piece of you. I just would like to be in a room with you before we are instruments at someone else’s table."

He nodded because his mouth was busy keeping his heart from walking out of it.

She left twenty minutes later in a car that had been summoned by a man who called her "Miss Vale" and said things into his sleeve and then stood in front of the door to make sure she navigated the stairs without being measured by a camera. Nathan watched her go and his hand was warm where she had held it because sometimes you can't be cool with the heat you have. He took a sip of coffee which had gone cold, then decided that the taste was how he felt about all of it—bitter and sweet and nothing to do but swallow.

Saturday hugged itself around the city like a shawl. At six a.m., Bath was yards of empty like an unrolled bolt of cloth, waiting for scissors. Nathan shaved with the razor that always left him skeptical, put on the shirt that fit his shoulders as if it had forgiven them for their sins, and packed the little bag with the little things: a spare pair of socks, a tin of mints, the letter from his Gran folded so often it had become soft as cloth.

Eva came to the door with her hair in no mood and a travel mug of coffee that had the density of ambition. Mum was behind her with a carton of sandwiches like she had crackled them into existence through sheer force of will and butter. Kian blew kisses off the tips of his fingers like a magician dropping coins. They made too much noise in the hallway and startled the cat who had decided that boxes were dangerous again always. They laughed so they wouldn’t cry, because that’s what the clever do. The blue door closed with the click of a trick drawer.

The car that came for him was a black thing that had opinions about itself, the kind that liked to whisper obstinacy down low. The driver got out and said Nathan’s name as if he were asking a question on a quiz show and then did something old-fashioned, opening the rear door. He was pale, a little, and had a scar that ran from his ear down under his jaw into the collar of his shirt, which Nathan noticed and then deliberately forgot to notice, because people are allowed their maps. The man looked at the sandwiches with a kind of awe.

"You’ve brought half the shop," he said.

"My mother," Nathan explained. "We will keep you from fainting."

"Already in your debt," the driver said. He had a voice like someone who’d worn out his laugh on cigarettes and then quit out of love for someone else. "We’ll get you there in plenty of time. Traffic’s light." A pause. "Name’s Danny."

Eva looked at Nathan with eyebrows that said: We approve of drivers named Danny. Mum handed Danny a foil-wrapped something with authority and he said thank you three times and then they were off, rolling past the Abbey where the earliest tourists were composing their day. Nathan watched Bath recede in the little frame of the rear window until it just became a thought.

He exhaled. He took out his phone. He wrote to Lina: On our way. You ok?

A little dot, then another, then the dots faded as if she had put the phone down to deal with Felton. Then: Running late but alive. Don’t break your neck. Break somebody else’s if they ask stupid questions.

He smiled at the phone liked it had said something charming. He put it down. Danny drove with his hands low on the wheel and his eyes on the road and something else, a kind of quiet that wasn’t quite professional reserve. Eva fell asleep with her head back and her mouth open in the way she would hate to be photographed doing, and Mum knitted with the ferocious concentration of a general deploying troops. Nathan watched hedges go by, then hard shoulder, then sky. His thoughts spooled. He thought about the regiment, about Sergeant Hesketh saying the truth, about Mara’s hand in this. About the car in the corner near the butcher’s.

At Membury, somewhere between coffee and the black smear of the M4, Danny signaled and exited into a service area that smelled like coffee ground twice and small fries and rain. He said, "Toilet break," and Mum nodded and said, "All of us," as if he were another son, which made Nathan want to hug both of them and also keen a bit. They spilled out under the big signage. Danny stretched and looked at the sky as if it had done him a personal favor. Nathan went in, washed his hands, looked in the mirror, found a man who was not thirteen and terrified anymore and also exactly that.

He came out into the car park and felt something shift. The air. The timing. One car eased in near them and then another. Old black hatchback behind them, a dark van out to the side, a shine in the second’s windscreen. Danny looked up and saw it too and did not change his face, which told Nathan more than a shout would have. Eva, the fastest reader in the world when it came to his pulse, was already at his side with her bag over her shoulder like a weapon.

The hatchback door opened and a man got out, and it was the man from the lamppost, or his cousin, or his shadow. He looked more tired in daylight, the way men do at six months into a plan. He walked like he had practice walking in places where other men didn’t belong.

Danny said, easy, "Back in the car, please," and Mum, for once, did as she was told, because she had seen this before, a long time ago, in other clothes.

"Nathan Lark," the man said, and he did not smile, which would have made him less or more dangerous, Nathan could not decide. "Congratulations on your success. We’re going to have a quick word." He glanced at Eva and then at Danny as if acknowledging them, as if the script had annotations about extras. "No problem. No problem at all."

"Get in," Danny said, quiet, to Nathan, and Nathan took one step too slow because he had trained himself not to run until the rotation of the planet had made it absolutely necessary. That’s when he felt the small cold thing press into the soft space above his hip, and the man with the tired face said intimately, "Don’t. It’s not a weapon. It’s my hand. But we can pretend it is. Walk."

A permanent hum started behind Nathan’s ears. The car park glittered with little stones like salt caught in tar. Eva said, "No," like a bell.

Danny moved, then, not to strike, but to stand in the space where Nathan was intending to go. He was a big man in a way that only shows when it has work to do. His face said: think. Nathan put his hands up as if he had been told to, which he had, by a thousand training hours in a thousand different rooms. He smiled. It was a bad idea. He had no idea what else to do with his mouth.

"We’ve got time," the man said. "It won’t be long. You’ll be back in time for your—I hesitate to call it a race. Your event. It’s just a chat. Get in the van. Please."

We make our choices, Nathan thought. Hands in the right place or the wrong place. A joke or a shout. He said, "I can’t go with you."

"Can," the man said. "Will." He kept his voice natural. People were walking around them with bags of doughnuts and toddlers, the cheerful innocence of motorway relief, and there was a click behind Nathan that might have been a car door or the change in air pressure that happens when a thing is about to snap. "Don’t be noble," the man said. "Be quick."

Mum’s hands were on the inside of the window, white like chalk. Eva took a step as if the ground were a piece of paper on which she could write a different line, a better one. Danny, this man called Danny, lifted his chin just enough that Nathan saw the old scar pull. It was absolutely nothing like a signal and exactly like one.

And then, as if an editor had cut the tape and spliced in the stupid part of the movie where the hero does something brave and idiotic, Nathan tipped his head as if to concede, and dropped his weight and spun, grabbing the man’s wrist with the certainty of a dance. They ended up with the man’s arm behind his back, a figure Lina would have scolded him for having bad line on, and he pushed the bloke against the van hard enough to make it grunt.

"Run!" Eva said, although where, and how, and what for, could not be explained by any map.

The driver of the hatchback stepped out and showed them the absence of a weapon like it was a lesson: empty hands spread wide, a nothing that could be something. He smiled. It was tidy, like a hospital. Nathan heard his own breath like a bellows. He tightened his grip because that was what he knew how to do.

"Now that’s that," the man he held said, not angry, just resigned. "No one needs to make a mess. We’ve got a message and then you can go. This isn’t the bit." He made his mouth into a shape that could be almost friendly. "The bit comes later."

Danny moved again, and Nathan thought, at last, at last, and then someone behind him did something with a cloth and a smell, and the world, which had been behaving up until then with plausible decorum, folded.

He woke with the taste of sadness on his tongue and the smell of upholstery that had been new when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister, which is to say long ago and yet not very. His cheek was against vinyl. The van’s engine made a noise like a man thinking about telling the truth. He tried to move his hand and found that it was less free than he preferred. He kept perfectly still because he had learned, in barracks and barrens, that the second movement after waking should always be the smallest one.

"Well then," the man with the tired face said conversationally. "Good morning again. Tick tock. Don’t worry. This is a prelude."

Nathan, who had fallen just as he had been told not to, took a breath and signed up for the day like a volunteer. Somewhere, not very far away, Bath was waking without him, and London, that greedy mouth, was waiting with lights and applause and all the things that look like love from far away.He lay very still and let the van tell him a story. The panels creaked when the road wavered, a swell passing under a boat; the tyres sang the long vowel of motorway; there was a rattle in the left rear that wouldn’t pass an MOT in a just universe. His cheek had welded a patch of sweat to vinyl and there was grit under his tongue as if he had been chewing the car park, which in a way he had. He tested the edges: left wrist tugged and met the thin inflexible bite of a cable tie; right wrist likewise; ankles together but not fastened, which told him somebody thought of themselves as humane or thought him incapable of much mischief. His head was clear enough to be embarrassed by the clarity. Chloroform in films knocks people out like a switch; in real life what he remembered was the rough wet of cloth and that instant of stupid childish offence—don’t—before everything turned grey, not black, like theatre lights dimming with too much sentiment.

“You still with us?” asked the voice in the front, conversational, the tired-faced man doing what Nathan’s Gran had called Sunday tone, soothing as church but with less God. “Before you get clever, roll onto your back. The sleeping beauty pose. You’ll breathe better and save yourself an argument with your lungs.”

He did as told because an argument with his lungs had never ended well and because compliance buys seconds, and sometimes seconds turn out to be small ladders everyone else has overlooked. He turned. The world righted itself; the van roof lined itself over him like a sky with stickers. His mouth tasted like copper coins and regret. He swallowed and made his voice calm for the sake of the animal in his chest that refused to be fooled by him. “Where are we going?”

“Away from the services,” the man said dryly, and someone in the passenger seat made a sound at the back of their throat that could have been a laugh or a cough. “You were overfond of geography at school, I see. Roads, hedges, bridges with numbers on. You and I both know you could get out and count the white lines and you’d still say: somewhere between here and a mess.”

“My mother,” Nathan said, because there are people you are allowed to say before yourself and she was always the first. “The woman with me. The driver.”

“All fine,” the man said, not clipping the words to sound efficient, but letting them out easy, as if kindness cost nothing. “We don’t do bodies. We do timings. Your driver did the correct thing and telephoned an appropriate person. Your girl with the flour on her apron could run a battalion if she felt like it. Your mum is terrifying in the preferred way. To calm you: no one’s following. No one knows where you are except us and now, by virtue of being here, you. I’m sorry to be dramatic on a Saturday.”

“Let me sit up,” Nathan said, because asking for control in two-inch increments was better than asking the universe to redo a morning. “Or take this off my wrists and we can have your chat like functioning mammals.”

“That’s the spirit,” said the other voice, younger, closer to cheerful, the hatchback driver perhaps, whose tidy smile Nathan had not liked for reasons he could now articulate: it had the absence of pity integrated into it like a design flaw. There was a shuffle and a hand came over the back of the seat, pale at the wrist, the cable tie clicked and then loosened halfway, enough that he could bring his hands in front of him and sit with his shoulders cursing him. He had a moment to believe in these men’s competence without committing to it, and took it, because belief was also a ladder.

The van felt longer now that he was upright, a hollow thing that had transported wardrobes and broken promises, smelled of oil and an old fish and chip wrapper trying to pass for a ghost. Through the smeared plexi grid he saw the backs of two heads, one shaved to indifference, one with hair cut at home, likely by a wife who read the instructions and ignored them politely. He rolled his wrists to get blood back into his hands and catalogued. Small mole by the left ear of the driver. Long fingers on the tired man, the kind of hands that had held something delicate once and then learned to ruin with gentleness. The road outside shifted from long straight to a bend that told him nothing, hedgerows turned to fence, then a low run of brick. He counted his breath to twenty and then did it again because counting was still a spell against dissolution.

“What do I call you?” he asked. “Since we’re doing a chat.”

“You can call me Stephen,” the tired man said, making a joke of it without laughing. “Everyone does. Even my enemies, who are better company than my friends. And that’s Darren, who is a saint on the road and a liability at weddings.”

“I don’t go to weddings,” the driver said mildly. “I mend radios and keep my head down.”

“Look at that,” Stephen murmured, “we’re doing backstories, Michael. You are an interviewer’s dream.” He twisted slightly, enough that Nathan caught the profile and a slice of dark stubble that wanted to be a beard but was disciplined daily. The eyes were as tired as the face had threatened, but they were not dead. People who intend harm carry a particular deadness to spare themselves from the choreography of guilt. These didn’t. Dangerous and not dead was somehow worse, because then you had to respect them.

“Why?” Nathan said, refusing narrative ease, because he had been given lines in life and did not always fancy saying them. “If it’s not bodies, and it’s not ransom, and you’ve been following me since Bath or you’ve been clever enough to seem to have, then why me and why today?”

“Because next Saturday you will not have any space around you that is not watched,” Stephen said simply. “Because right now you have a pocket of morning in which you can be apprehended without becoming the daily news. Because you’re about to decide whether you’re in the business of grace or in the business of getting. Because you are good, Mr Lark, and good men are useful in the market.”

“Market,” Nathan repeated, holding the word up to the light and grimacing at its facets. “Do you expect me to believe this is—what—a bookmaker’s errand? That I should throw a dance?”

“I expect you to hear me,” Stephen replied. “Belief can come later. Or not at all. There are men who never believe in gravity and still fall through skylights. We are the practical wing of a practical interest in outcomes, that’s all. No politics. No ideologies. Arms length and deeply dull. It would bore you if it weren’t your neck.”

“There are easier competitors to scare,” Nathan said, the soldier in him assembling options, snapping on bits of dark humour like kit. “There are women in sequins who would turn to dust if a man in a van coughed at them, men with bones like glass and egos like foams. Why me.”

“Because you’re stubborn and because you listen,” Stephen said, and Nathan did him the courtesy of blinking, of letting the accuracy be admitted, like a jab landing. “Because you will go to the line we draw and then lean away, which is interesting. Because people who love you will do so loudly and that noise spills profit if it’s channeled. Because you are not supposed to win, not in the narrative the show has purchased, and there are a lot of accounts balancing on the fulfilment of a narrative. You know this. You read the face of a Sergeant and the mouth says something bland and the eyes say: not this time. Same trick. Bigger set. Brighter lights. They do not want your face when the confetti falls. We do not want to break a sweat making that happen. So here we are. We give you a place to put your foot down that looks like choice.”

Nathan let that swim in him and then speak as if through him. “You want me to lose.”

“We want you to declare a body,” Darren said from the wheel, half-turning with the air of a man making a suggestion about milk. “The ankle. The story writes itself. He gave it everything. He’s a hero who knows when to pull back. The country likes a stoic. You double your brand by halving your chances.”

“The ankle is not a prop,” Nathan said, the old heat flaring, ridiculous that this, of all the ways they could cut him, was the one to raise his hackles. “And it does not perform on cue. It is a bastard in private and behaves in public because it has manners.”

“Then fall,” Stephen said, the mildness returning like a tide. “Not a noble collapse, those are booed. A slip. You know the work—make it look like you’ve recovered and you’ve wrecked something in the recovery. Do not consult Lina; she will disown you with her eyes in a way that will ruin us all. Tell no one. A whisper travels this business faster than a cheetah on a scooter and kills the very thing it loves. You make the sound you make when men are told we’re disappointed. You go out in third place or second if your fans are noisy. You go home to Bath and learn to use a sponsorship to fix your mother’s roof. You sleep at night. Or you don’t. But you sleep at all.”

“What if I say no,” Nathan said, because he had to say it; because the body needs to test the bars of the cage even when it knows its size by heart.

“Then other men you will not meet will speak to other people you do not know and the little lights in your life will dim and come back on a fraction to the right,” Stephen said evenly. “The cat will return, because cats do, but he will jump at sharper shadows for a time. The bakery will pass a health inspection and then fail for a different reason, one with a longer acronym and more abbreviations in the notes. The door with blue paint will require a carpenter who overcharges and subcontracts a man with too much paint on his hands and not enough in his soul. You will not be marked physically, that is vulgar and invites stories. Your circle will simply become a shade smaller than it was and set like that and you will not be able to take a deep breath because something in you will know it is your doing.”

“You’ve been watching,” Nathan said, tasting anger now and keeping it sweet on his tongue because some rooms only open if you smile nicely at the man with the key. “You’ve got details you think make a threat look like a poem.”

“We have been paying attention,” Stephen agreed, and did the smallest of nods that could count as respect. “And we can be persuaded. We are capable of being moved by the right sermon. I’m not made of brick.”

“What would move you,” Nathan asked, and knew the answer was money and also that it wasn’t; that with these men the bolder currency was obedience.

“A promise,” Stephen said. “And the impression you mean it. We both know men are little machines built to lie to themselves first and others second. Show me that you will help me keep my job and I will help you keep the rest of your life as you prefer to tell it.”

“You don’t expect me to shake on that with my hands tied,” Nathan said, and was annoyed to hear the smile in his voice, as if his mouth, traitorous, had been waiting to deliver that line from some doomed noir.

“We expect you to move your right hand two inches to the left and take this water,” Stephen said, and there it was, as if the van had read his hunger and conjured a bottle. The cap cracked like a polite knuckle. He drank and it hurt and then it was better, the water cool in a way water in vans never is, which made him think they had a cooler and that meant a plan and that meant this had not been rushed. He drank again. He looked at the small cut near his thumb, a nick that had reawoken, and saw, under the new bleed, his gran’s handwriting in his head. If you dance for them, dance for you twice. What is that twice worth, he thought. Where do you put it, when men come with arithmetic.

He asked, “Where are you taking me. A car park somewhere with a useful wall. A lay-by. A lock-up with a kettle and a folding chair so I feel like an episode of a show where men in nylon anoraks interrogate each other gently.”

“It’s important to me that you not be traumatised,” Stephen said, and the deadpan was convincing enough that Nathan let out a small unbeautiful noise he refused to name as laughter. “We’re going to a room where no one will mind if we stand in it for twenty minutes. Then we will bring you to a piece of London which is adjacent to the piece of London you need. You will be not late enough to scare the runners but late enough to pay attention next time a stranger says please.”

“Danny,” Nathan said, and those two syllables were dry for his trouble. “You said he called someone. Who.”

“A man with a better vocabulary than the police,” Stephen said. “Before you panic, he used the number we expected him to use. Your friend is not ours, not if you’re asking me to lay him on this altar, but he is a man who recognises a losing shape and chooses not to stand in front of it. He has made himself useful to people before out of the simple human desire to keep his own roof from leaking.”

“God we’re all so boring,” Darren said, swinging them off the motorway with a signal like a small bow to fate. “Incredible the lengths we’ll go to keep the plaster on.”

They ran under a viaduct, along a strip where warehouses had learned the names of their weeds, past a chain-link fence that had painted condemnation in flaking white and then been embarrassed by its own melodrama. The van pulled into a yard where a forklift had once pushed crates until it had remembered it could not feel affection. A shutter rolled up and the noise was a mouth of metal. Inside, the light had a hangover. They parked. The engine turned to quiet like a argument that had found no winner.

“Out,” Stephen said, and there was none of the theatre of fear Nathan had expected from his youthful reading, no display of weapon or even posture. They stepped him down and he moved as if his ankle belonged to someone who owed him a favour. The room had the taste of damp on its tongue and a gentle slope to one corner that any dancer would turn into something sooner or later. There was a chair which they brought into the space like a guest of honor. They did not ask him to sit. He stood. He preferred to stand.

“There is a thing you are not accounting for,” he said, and watched Stephen’s face for that minute ripple that meant new information. “And I can’t decide whether to tell you because you’ll use it like a knife or because you might leave me a bandage with it.”

“Go on,” Stephen said, and there it was, the ripple. The man liked to have the world named to him. He had been a child once who turned spoons and scissors over in his hands to see which hurt and which helped.

“I’m not crucial to how that night goes,” Nathan said. “This is not the story you think you’ve bought a piece of. It’s two bodies moving in a box while the nation tries to remember how to breathe. She is as important as I am. Which means: it may not be up to me to fall or not fall. It will be in her hands and her feet and in the sound the room makes in the second before the downbeat. I can do what you ask and the world will still meant to mean something else, and the story will go there. And then you will come back and say I didn’t keep my word, and I will have to persuade you that I did, in fact, fall in my heart, and we will both find ourselves ridiculous.”

Stephen’s eyes warmed in a way that made Nathan want to hit him. “You are, under the glow and the kindness, a man with his own cruelty,” he said softly. “I would have liked working with you in a world where I wasn’t asked to kidnap you for twenty-five minutes. You are right. There are variables I can’t chase with a net that small. So here is what we will do, Mr Lark, and it is very dull, and it may save you from the grief that comes of trying to keep your promises to men like me.”

He took from his pocket a phone that looked like it had been designed to withstand war, and held it up like a small flag. “We will be in the room where it happens—oh, don’t flinch, I am a man of the musical age and have had nieces—and we will watch the first dance. You will know we are there because the back of your neck will perform a small opera. If the result is trending in the wrong direction for the men who feed my children, we will do nothing because we are patient. If it is trending in the wrong direction and continues to do so because the judges have decided to give you a score that is an act of aggression against my pension, then you will do what men do when they have pushed a body too far. You will allow your ankle to remember the desert. You will exit while there is still narrative available to you. You will be so brave and so good at it that I will cry and Darren will use the inside of his sleeve and we will all go home feeling like we have done something noble with a knife. If the night does not require that, then we will politely clap and make the best of a thing that paid less than we hoped. We are capable of that.”

“And if I do none of this,” Nathan said, because like an idiot he had to say it again just to hear how his own voice would take the taste of it twice.

“Then your bakery has a fire and it is no one’s fault and the footage looks like weather,” Stephen said, not unkindly. “And Eva decides that Bath has too many ghosts and moves to somewhere that does not mean as much to you. She will be ultimately happy because she is built that way, but she will be happy in a place where your ghost has less room to move. We will not touch your mother. That’s ugly. But we will rearrange the furniture in your small world until walking through it is something you do with your hands in front of your face. And if you go to the police—and why wouldn’t you—we will be gone and the men you find will be men you already watched at the garage, fixing a wing mirror and trying to work out which late-night show will have them on if they are found funny enough by the internet.”

Nathan did something he had not planned to do, which was laugh. It came up against the damp smell and made it bearable for a moment. “You say all that as if you’ve got any control over your own consequences,” he said. “As if there aren’t so many ways this goes wrong for you that you might trip over the first one just getting back into your van.”

“You see,” Stephen said, and for the first time admiration came to sit next to his voice and share a cigarette with it, “I want you to win because I like winners. It’s ugly. I like men who know their own steps. But I like mortgages more, and I like not seeing my wife’s face do a thing I’ve been preventing for ten years if I can keep her from it. We are made of two parts, all of us. You of all men should know that, Mr Lark. I’ve watched you turn the second part on when the song asks and we applaud in our living rooms and tell ourselves it was always there. It wasn’t. You invited him. Invite him again and then tell him to leave early.”

They gave him more water and then left him alone for a minute with a strip light that had only learned one song and was bored to pieces of it. He flexed his hands and considered the possibility that this had all been a rehearsal for the day when he would be asked to be a coward professionally. He thought of Lina, the way she would read his face before he had even put it on, the way she would put her hand on his chest without looking down and say very low the name for the thing the two of them knew in two languages. He thought of Mara Vale and the kind of danger she was, to herself, to others, to him if he dared let her stand near where he was soft. He thought of the boy doing wheelies near the bus station and wished he could go back and tell him that sometimes the men at the edge of your day are not there for your wallet or your blood. Sometimes they are there for a number on the bottom of a page you will never see.

“We should go,” Darren said, and he led them out as if showing them the features of a house he was keen to sell: here, brick. Here, roller shutter. Here, sky, where it belonged, not falling, despite your fears. They put him back in the van with a gentleness that almost made him ill. They drove, and the motorway welcomed them as if they were commuters who had simply stopped for a long stretch and now wished to be folded back into the day. He checked the time in the blurry face of the dashboard clock and found that he had been borrowed for less than an hour. A lifetime and the room you went into to clean your teeth.

When they pulled off again it was not at a TV studio door but at a corner where London began without ceremony, a stretch of houses that had been converted into particular dreams by men with permits: a dentistry with a frosted window and a pun for a name; a solicitor’s that had given up arguing and become an accountant; a cafe that thought it was Paris if you looked at it with half-shut eyes. The van stopped in a place where stopping was a suggestion offered by the kerb. Stephen turned half around and looked like a vicar about to conclude a service.

“You will go,” he said, as if Nathan hadn’t been planning to leap out since they’d merged back into civilisation. “You will do what you do with a body that’s got a bit of history and an inconvenient talent for joy. You will look at that woman as if she is not made of a composite material designed to resist sincerity. You will remember to breathe when the cameras and the drumbeats think they can outpace you. We will meet again, in a way that will disappoint storytellers for its lack of flourish. We will sit at the back in our coats and clap politely. Even if you decide to become my enemy tonight, I will clap, because I am raising a son and I do not want him to think that liking a thing makes him weak.”

Darren leaned back into the space between the seats and offered Nathan a square of kitchen roll as if that made the whole performance legal. There was grease at one corner as if it had once wrapped something that had rescued a breakfast. “Your hair’s a mess,” he said. “You might like it that way, but it reads as ‘collected from a hedge’ on camera.”

“It’s regulation hedge,” Nathan said, because the joke was a handhold back to a self he wanted to keep, and both men laughed as if he had given them a cordial toast.

He stepped out into the air that tasted of bus exhaust and ambition and nearly went to his knees because the world had developed an extra dimension in the last hour and he could not tell whether it was his or someone else’s. He put a hand out flat on the paint of the van and felt its flimsy reality. He walked. The van took itself into the stream of Saturday and became none of his business. He slid the kitchen roll into his pocket because it was a ridiculous keepsake, and ridiculous keepsakes anchor you when nothing grand will. He made his way toward the railway, because the car was gone and the day still had to be ridden like a horse that had decided it would bolt if you let it smell fear. He texted Lina because that was the rope he had, two words she would read in the tone he meant. Running late.

The reply came back in nothing like the time that etiquette prescribes. Where are you, she wrote, and then, in the voice that was a hand at the back of his neck: Are you hurt. Because she had decided that if he were dead somebody would have done her the courtesy of calling her, and that meant that the catastrophe was of a class she could beat with verbs. He wrote: No. Later. Trust me. And he wanted to throw up because he had used Stephen’s word and it had felt like a chip sliding into the right slot in a machine and that was exactly what he did not want to be.

At Paddington the station was as it always was, a cathedral for trains with hymnals that smelled like wet newspapers, people in weekend clothes performing the part of people in weekend clothes with eyes that looked like they had slept in ordinary beds. He caught sight of himself in a window and stopped because a stranger looked back at him, one who had borrowed his height and put it on a different skeleton. The time on the station clock tugged at him. He ran a hand over his face and found that he was washing it without water, the way men do when there is no mirror and too much truth. He bought a coffee that tasted of burnt sugar and stubbornness and drank half of it because to drink all of it would mean admitting that his mouth had become a cave.

He did not tell the security man who asked him for his pass what had happened to him between Bath and here because men like that already had too much of other people’s errand in their heads. He put on the lanyard someone handed him with his name spelled right. He saw the little plastic rectangle hanging on the chest of a runner and nearly wept with love for the harmless bureaucracy of lives that have not been interrupted. He walked into the corridor of the studio with its taped lines and its signs that told professionals to do things they needed no signs to remember, and the smell of hairspray and worn carpet rolled over him like a rumour and then became a fact.

Mara Vale was there in a chair with her feet tucked up, her trainered toes peeking as if to prove something unglamorous about her, which she didn’t need to prove. She saw him and unfolded, which is to say stood, and for a moment something was too bright in the room and then retracted itself as if scared. She took three steps to him and stopped one step away because some people learn the quantum physics of proximity from necessity. Her hand hovered. “You all right,” she said, in a way that didn’t require him to say yes in order not to disappoint her.

“Yes,” he said, and found that the word sat on the back of his tongue like a coin you hold there for luck. “I got waylaid by men who think the world owes them for the time they spent learning not to be good.”

Her eyes did a small, clean widening, and then she put the event away on a shelf from which she could retrieve it later with both hands. “Do I need to… has someone… are you safe,” she said, and those were the three rooms she knew how to open for herself every day and now she opened them for him.

“I’m here,” he said, and stepped forward into the permission she had left in the air between them. He did not hug her. He let the silence be what it needed to be, a thing with joints that could bend without breaking. “Are you afraid of me?”

She snorted, the old-fashioned kind, a young woman startled by her own honest noise. “Always,” she said. “And never. Afraid for, perhaps. You smell like tarmac and threat. Sit down before somebody puts a powder on you and tells you it will make you look dewy. I hate that word. Makes everyone look dipped in oil and regret.”

“There’s a segment,” a production person said, sliding up the corridor like a hat blown off a head and retrieved before anyone noticed, “with the regimental chap who said a thing that made me cry at my desk. And the bit on the Crescent. And you have ten minutes with Mara before the sponsor has to put her in front of a car no one can afford. Nathan, darling, your mother is very determined about sandwiches and a fire marshal has had to have a conversation with her. She is the bravest woman I ever met. I say that as someone who once interviewed a tightrope walker.”

“Tell her I love her and I will eat them on the other side of the end of the world,” he said, and the girl—woman—whatever the word was for the person moving like a brilliant bird—nodded with ferocious sympathy and was gone.

Lina found him the way people find water underground. He didn’t see her first. He felt the shift in the air because energy changes shape when people with your name in their mouths enter a room. She walked up and put one palm in the middle of his chest as if to keep him in one place long enough to take his pulse properly. Her eyes said later in six languages and her mouth said, at a normal volume, “We’re fine. Felton fell off a chair. It was the highlight of my morning.”

He looked at her hand. He remembered what Stephen had suggested, that he lie to everyone he loved for the sake of strangers’ rent. He imagined telling Lina the thing. She would do that human thing where every tiny muscle in the face becomes history. She would then remain his friend because loyalty is her hobby. He could not give her that face. He could not do that to the version of himself that has to dance with her in ten minutes. “We aim for truth,” he said, and she laughed because she thought he was making a joke about choreography, which he was, and also he wasn’t.

He stood with both women, one famous for reasons that always seemed to him a bit daft and a bit holy, one famous only to him for reasons that might keep him alive. The studio hummed. Around them, a thousand small acts of work held the whole thing up. Someone argued with someone else about glitter. A man in a headset ran because the person after him had walked and the difference would have been visible on screen. Nathan breathed, the way the old training had taught him to breathe, down into the parts of him that think the lungs are a luxury.

“You’re going to be very good,” Mara said, not as a charm but as a curse that might come true if said the right way in the right room. “People will write to you and you’ll be even more polite than you are now and it will kill you a bit and then you’ll make dinner and it’ll be fine. Also, the men with the clipboards will ask you about the ankle and how… how is the ankle, actually.”

“It will do what it is told,” he said, and the two women looked at him as if he had just confessed to keeping a dragon under his bed. “I can make a body be something else for a time. That’s all we’re doing anyway. I plan to do exactly and only that for as long as it takes.”

“‘If you dance for them,’” Mara said, almost under her breath, as if she were reading from the letter folded in his bag without having ever seen it, “‘dance for you twice.’ Who wrote that on your face, Lark.”

“My grandmother,” he said, and for a minute the roof of the studio was a tin lid on a kitchen and his feet were in lino and his lungs were blessed.

On the monitor down the corridor they had a rehearsal looped, someone else standing where he would stand later and pretending to be him, which is all anyone can do with anyone anyway. He watched a man in a black t-shirt lift a woman in a green sash and thought: Right, then. The van had been a room. This was another. He could move through rooms. He had learned to do that and to leave as much of himself intact as the door would allow. The tracks in him shifted. He found his place to start, counted four, and then forgot to be afraid long enough to remember why he did any of this at all. The men who wanted to buy a movement would have to wait their turn. The body, like all good citizens, would be governed by the music.By the time the red light blinked on the camera cowl like a benign warning and the floor manager’s headset hissed with other people’s imperatives, the room had narrowed itself into the shape Nathan remembered from children’s television: glare and the illusion of a cold he couldn’t feel because his body had converted all available sensation into a single frequency of readiness. He stood in the wings where tape on the floor made an alphabet for feet and read the letters with the hungry care of a boy faced with his first library. Lina bounced once on the balls of her feet, then settled, her face doing that extraordinary cleanse where all the day fell off it and only the point remained. He saw the little mark on her wrist where a bracelet had caught earlier and was glad he had not been there to see Felton’s chair-hand become a diagram; he liked his fury unopened when it served them.

“Don’t look at the lens,” she said, and he smiled because of course she had to say it, because ritual is a rope and mates tie it even when they’re walking on a broad pavement. “Look at me. Look at me when you’re meant to be looking at the ceiling or the middle distance or the idea of God. I’ve got enough face for two.”

“I’ve got the middle distance under control,” he said. “God will have to wait.” He breathed down into the bottom of himself where old exercises lived and found the place where his shoulders stopped pretending to be shields and became hinges again. He glanced to the back of the tiered audience because curiosity is a disease with symptoms that look like intelligence, and there they were—two men in coats that had learned to be background, not together, not obvious, not even in sync with each other’s stillness, just present in that way you only notice if you have learned to catalogue quiet. The back of his neck filled with knowledge that was not quite fear and not an ache either, a little orchestra tuning itself with small stabs of sound.

Mara padded across to them with cards in her hand and an earpiece like a small insect clinging to her and smiled in a way that would have sold a lot of any product that believed in miracles. Close-to, he saw the edges she kept for herself; the smile was not a door, it was a window propped open on a stick. “They are feeding me questions about the ankle,” she said in a tone that wanted to be a joke and failed because jokes don’t ask permission with their eyes. “I will do as I am told and fail politely. If you see me toss the cards from my left hand to my right, that is me changing the subject on your behalf. You can help me by being charming in a way that makes it look like my idea.”

“I can be a lamp,” he said. “Or a fern. Or a man who has decided he is not going to break theatrically on live television.”

She nodded without moving her chin because movement is currency and presenters learn to fold notes without anyone hearing the paper. “If they come at you after, if anyone you don’t know uses your name like a key, I’ll have Mal in your corridor. He has the face of a bouncer and the soul of a pastry chef. He will be very kind in ways that terrify men.”

“I’m not going to be a problem,” Nathan said, and it was not bravado. It was the flat truth of a man who had decided the shape of the next twenty minutes with the same authority he used when choosing whether to take cover on instinct or to stand where he was and wait for the second noise.

No one called it a first dance; they called it a package and then a VT and then a count-in and then a sequence and then everything else they needed to call it to convince the machinery inside the building that it was doing something other than placing a human heart on a plate for the nation to cut into with forks. He and Lina walked out to their marks as if nothing about walking could betray them. The set threw gold at the corners like a party trying too hard. The music began slightly too loud because the sound man had been told to be brave this week. Nathan tipped his head and listened until the first bar resolved into a shape his feet knew, and then there was no choice to be made at all.

It had been a tango once and they had taken the corners off it not because the show preferred soft things but because his ankle hated hard conclusions. It began with a backwards step that looked like a retreat and wasn’t, his hand above her shoulder like a thought he’d had twice. Lina’s weight was where he’d hoped it was, not in her hip or her heel but in the place he could steer without insulting her or the music. They moved through the square and the lights pretended to be night in Buenos Aires while everyone in the room remembered they were in a warehouse near Hounslow. He didn’t look at the judges’ desk or the faces behind it that were trained to open and shut like theatre doors. He did not look at the black of the camera. He did not look into the ordinary darkness where the men in coats sat like pockets of weather. He looked at Lina, who had decided to be dangerous in the way knives are dangerous when they are being used to cut bread for hungry people.

A corner became a curve. His ankle tried to tell him a story and he said later, but not rudely. They did the little trick Simone from wardrobe liked, where her skirt made a single seditious opinion of his leg and everyone thought something they would not confess to thinking on a Sunday. His heart beat in the right meter. They stopped in the place they had agreed to stop and the world returned to itself like a held breath let go. The noise, which had waited like a dog, launched itself.

After things like this, strangers tell you what you meant. The panel did its trained expression of impressed and reluctant, the version you give a nephew who has built a tower without being told to by anyone you respect. A woman known for a glitter that had the density of armour said something about connection that made teenage girls across the country flatten their faces against sofas. An ex-pro told him his frame was like a promise that didn’t hurt to keep. A man with the cheapest tie on television said he wouldn’t have thought a soldier could be so tender with a foot and Nathan laughed because when you don’t laugh someone will write you a new character from scratch and make you live in it.

Mara came in like weather clearing, her hand warm and dry in his arm for the ten steps up to the little platform where interview happened as if it were a form of doctor’s waiting room. “You looked like you were listening,” she said into the microphone in a way that suggested this was a question and in another way made it a blessing.

“That’s my only trick,” he said, and on one of the small monitors in the corner he saw the wide shot of them, her hair behaving in the way hair behaves when it has been bribed, his face with too much open in it, Lina like a challenge, and he thought: it isn’t mine or theirs; it’s both. “My gran taught me. Two steps and a turn. Two steps. Turn. If I don’t listen, I fall.”

“And the ankle,” she said, dropping the cards from her left to her right so if anyone counted on that they had at least been warned. “You look very sound on it tonight. Do you feel sound?”

“It’s attached,” he said, and she let out the sound of someone who has had to say oh God on live television and decided to do it in a manner Ofcom could approve. The scoreboard did its little insurance salesman graphics and he did not look at it because numbers were not going to help him with the next three minutes of his life. He felt eyes like little dots of heat up where the coats sat. He smiled as if the audience in the room were the only audience and that in itself was treason enough.

Back in the wings, the air went soft as if the building had exhaled with him. The makeup woman dabbed something at the corner of his eye because men blinking look like saints and advertisers have slow, careful things to sell them later. Lina put her forearm against his and left it there for one second longer than any professional rule would sanction and then shrugged herself into the physics of whatever came next. “Trend?” she asked, as if they were traders looking to buy a moment before anyone else saw it on the board.

“Higher than men in jackets prefer,” he said. “Lower than the machine ordered.” He kept his mouth easy and his hands loose and let the part of him that had been in the van sit in a chair and put its head down for three breaths. Sometimes the trick is neither to deny nor to revel, but to allow, and that is not a thing shows like this teach; your gran has to or you learn it on exercise in the dark when the men around you are eating up the universe by mistake.

Eva found him as if walls were suggestions and he supposed for her they always had been. She had a laminate hung on a string like something won at a fair and glitter on her eyelashes, which she refused to acknowledge. She said nothing useful and everything in the way she grabbed his jaw and kissed his chin and told him off for sweating with the joy of it. Behind her, his mother had a paper bag under her arm like contraband and the expression of a woman who had argued with a fire marshal and thought she’d done very well. She looked at him, not at the man on stage or at the small celebrity with the hair, and she did not nod because her nods are expensive, but she let a line soften around her mouth and he was rich for another hour.

It is odd to sit in a corridor with cups and wire and strangers moving as if their bodies had been designed by sensible committees while your life decides to take a particular route. Mara folded herself into a chair across from him with a bottle of water that had a label designed to make people with money feel blessed. She had taken off the shoes the brand insisted on and was in her tights like any other person whose feet suffer for a living. “We can still make a nuisance,” she said in a conversational voice pitched for the flies on the wall. “If you decide to move a piece on the board, I’ll block for you. If you decide to call the police, I’ll look credible when I tell them what happened. But I have learnt, because I am not completely gormless, that men like the ones you met feed on the appearance of panic.”

“I don’t want to spend the last five minutes before the thing thinking about a van,” he said, and that was the closest he came to begging all day. “I want to stand in a box with the girl who knows where my feet should go and I want to not waste that on an argument with a shape. I want to make an okay thing and then a good thing out of the okay thing. I want to be useful to the right story.”

“You’re doing PR on the fly,” she said, not unkind. “You’re very good at it. You should frighten men who use words for money.”

“God help them,” he said, and the corridor shook briefly as somewhere someone dropped a truss pole and then did that industry laugh that says everything is fine because if it isn’t fine we won’t be paid.

The showdance was not a kind of dance. It was a category of exposure. You throw what you are at a piece of music and hope the people who have watched you learn to be a person in front of them will recognise either the throw or the man. He and Lina had built theirs out of things they could do in their sleep and one thing they could only do if they were looking out of the same window. It started without warning, no posture, no bow. He walked onto the floor like a boy into a kitchen, plain, unsoldiered, his hands visible. The music was not brash; he had argued for that. It was a piano with life in it and the kind of drum a heart makes when it’s remembered itself off a bus in the rain. Lina came to him not like an entrance but like the moment someone comes back because the kettle has boiled. They stepped. Two steps and a turn. Two steps, turn. The camera would show it as quaint because cameras like to patronise small holiness. He let it. The room knew and that was enough.

He lifted her, not high, not to insult the seamstresses by flashing the underskirt they had put so much work into; he lifted her because lifting is sometimes just making a place for someone to stop falling for a second, and she laughed the amount you laugh when a thing like that is true, even in a room like this. He felt his ankle as a presence, not pain, like an elderly relation observing with notes he would not be obliged to read. He folded her back to earth and heard the floor say yes as their shoes found it. The middle latched in with a bit they had put there to make men who only watch for tricks sit up like their name had been called. The end came when they asked it to. They finished with a turn that put his back to the judges and his face toward the coast of seats where the ghosts of Bath had come to look, and he could have sworn he saw his gran, ridiculous and true, as if the lights had remembered her for him and painted her on the back wall with glue that would come off in the wash.

For a second afterwards, silence did the thing only silence can do, which is build a room even bigger than the loudest sound can manage. Then people who had worked all day to make noise made noise and did not seem to resent that quiet had taken the best line. He was not crying. He was not. His eyes were simply obeying the laws of physics as they apply to ex-soldiers who have permitted themselves to be seen as something other than an inventory of competence.

The men in coats did not vanish or stand or applaud differently. That would have been too elegant. But one of them—Stephen, he thought, though he had not let himself learn that name so intimately that it could sit in his head without rent—put a finger to his tie as if straightening it and lifted his chin a fraction in a way that read as acknowledgement in the old language men use when they cannot write each other letters because that would be too much like confession. It was not a benediction. It was a receipt. Nathan breathed through it the way you breathe through the bit on a fast horse where it decides, having weighed your options evenly against its own, that you will get one vote in the process of slowing down.

The queue of next things formed like weather. Interviews you could be forgiven for not hearing. Scores that would matter until they didn’t. Somewhere inside the building a kettle clicked, and he thought of Mal, pastry-chef-souled, bouncer-faced, and hoped the man had a strong tea and somewhere not too noisy to drink it. Lina kissed his temple and swore into his hair in Polish and then called him a saint in a way that made sainthood seem like a mismanaged rota. “Whatever that was,” she said, “we can cheat with it one more time. Not twice. I will not cheat twice. Once, for good. Then we run.”

“Then we run,” he said, and the absurdity of the word in this room was a drug he drank with relief.

He had three minutes to remember the men who could not be here because life had bent their days to other rooms. He thought of Sergeant Hesketh’s little smile when he had made his remark about swagger, and he wondered whether the satellite feed would pixelate his face into a kindness at an angle and make a grandmother in Accrington love him. He thought of Danny’s hands low on the wheel and the old scar that had learnt to live in his face, and he let the anger that belonged to that man be unlit for now because there are times for bonfires and times for banked coals. He thought of the cat with a constellation and laughed in a way it would have disapproved of.

The third go was the judges’ pick, which is always part compliment and part cruelty, a chance to make you better at a thing that once nearly made you drop your teeth. They had chosen his quickstep because they had seen him clip his own courage on it three weeks ago and then use it in a better pattern. He and Lina had drilled it until the studio floor above the carpet warehouse had learned the sound of their apologies. He put the shame down next to the tape and did the running of men who are not running, and the lights attempted to chase him and failed because they were attached to quite sensible rails. His ankle decided it was in a good mood and then changed its mind as a joke halfway through a scatter-chassé, and he threatened to report it for insubordination and did not mean it. They finished with more air in the room than they had found, which is always the best you can say for a dance you survive with panache.

Afterwards, in the space that was not the corridor and not the stage and not anything a human being would choose to live in, he sat on a road case and looked at Mara’s shoes abandoned under the chair and thought about labour. She sat next to him with her legs folded in a way that would have alarmed a chiropractor and handed him a little piece of paper he did not take at first because notes are traps. “Don’t read it like a spy,” she said. “Read it like a person.”

It was the kitchen roll Darren had given him earlier, and someone had drawn a square on it with a black felt tip, careful, patient lines like a boy concentrating on getting corners. Inside the square, someone had written in a hand that looked young even if it belonged to a man: All we do is make rooms. You choose who you are in them. Underneath, in smaller writing that could have been an apology or a dare: We will be patient.

He put the paper back in her hand and she tucked it into the pocket in the back of the chair that held programmes and old jokes. “They’re not stupid,” she said. “It’s upsetting. I much prefer stupid adversaries. They let you nap.”

“They have children,” he said, because they had, because Stephen had said it like a shield and a knife in the same breath and Nathan knew what it was to be someone’s son even when you thought you couldn’t breathe under the weight of someone else’s love. “And mortgages. And a sense of their own decency that is not wholly invented. It does not make me want to invite them to tea. It makes me want to get this right and then never have to think about whether the roof leaks for anyone I love ever again.”

“You’re not going to fall,” she said, as if he might be considering it because she had been trained to notice the shape of a decision even when a man was sitting very still. “You’re too vain.”

“I’m vain about the wrong things,” he said. “Also the right things. I’m vain about the way my grandmother’s kitchen smelled like steam and polish after my granddad had buffed his shoes for a funeral. I’m vain about the girls at the bakery thinking they’ve made something fit for God if God happened to like cinnamon. I’m vain about not stopping because someone asked me to.”

She smiled in a way that would have been described as beautiful by three separate tabloids and ignored by everyone in the room whose business was not descriptions but acts. “You will win or you will lose,” she said. “And then the night will pack up its miracles and the men who move the flat will go home and take their shoes off and look at their toes and be amazed. You will sleep. You will wake. The city will smell like something else. If you need to call me tomorrow I will be in a hotel that thinks it is a monastery and is in fact an argument with a mini bar. I will answer. If you do not need to, I will not mistake your silence for rejection. I’m not twenty-two.”

“You’re right,” he said. “About all of it, which is boring of you. You should be wrong sometimes for sport.”

“I am wrong constantly,” she replied, and laughed in a way that made three grips pause and grin because happiness looks better when someone rich is doing it and everyone else gets to borrow the effect.

They put him back into the light because that is what light is for. The finalists stood in a row with their arms around each other like a gallows that had forgiven them in advance. He could feel Lina’s breath on his neck and the small message her shoulder sent his shoulder like two children in a class writing notes they had learned to fold so brilliantly no teacher could suspect. Mum had got the banner in somehow; it gleamed in the third row like a bad idea executed with sufficient commitment to make it charming. He saw Kian with a baguette he had smuggled in his coat like a joke he planned to tell in a taxi later. The judges did their last performance of wisdom and then the room held itself rigid for the name.

If you say you don’t care, you’re lying. If you say it will break you, you’re being Grecian and nobody asked for a chorus. He wanted to win because winning is a knot you can put on your rope and show to boys later, not because the television requires it to make a certain amount of noise on a winter night. He wanted to win because it would rewrite a little of the script other people held in their heads for men like him. He wanted to win because his gran would have laughed until her mouth hurt and Nathan was a man who liked to chase the sound of that laugh around corners and catch it in a glass for later.

Mara put her hand on the envelope as if it were a little wild animal that needed calming and looked at him because sometimes the only power you have is to let a person see that they are not invisible at the moment they would prefer to be. He nodded. She read. The name was not his. For a second that felt like two, the floor under him tried to become an ice rink and then remembered what it had promised the risk assessor and stayed floor. He held Lina as if he was congratulating a friend and he was, because the boy next to him had tears too big for his face and a story about a mother that would make rugby crowds stand.

The men in coats clapped without triumph, and he hated them a little for being decent and understood that this hatred had no place to live for long. He smiled the smile that meant good and thank you and I’ll be sick in a dustbin later and he did not use his ankle for anything but transport. The camera missed nothing and spared him nothing. He did not fall. He did not have to.

It took time to take the night apart and place it in boxes. He signed a face in the corridor because the face had come on a boy who could not hold his hands still and had decided that drawing was the way to keep them. He ate a triangle of bread with too much ham in it because his mother was a general and had captured the green room by force of will and a knowledge of municipal fire regulations. He found Lina in a stairwell where people who had just been very public went to remember how to hold their tongues. She put her head on his chest and said nothing for long enough that he got to hear his heart rediscover a normal beat.

“They didn’t get parts of you,” she said at last. “They must be disappointed. They always are, the ones who think people are furniture.”

“They were patient,” he said, and she snorted in a way that translated as my grandmother has a word for a patient thief, and it is not one I can say on the BBC. “They drew a square on a piece of kitchen roll.”

“They love squares,” she said. “They understand rooms they can describe. They do not understand the places between. That’s where we live. That’s where you dance. If they come again, I will glue their shoes to the floor and we will see how good they are at improvisation.”

“Please don’t go to jail,” he said. “It will upset Felton to have you absent and then he will take it out on a chair.”

“You danced for you twice,” she said, and then ruined the solemnity of the moment by biting his shoulder through his shirt because ridiculousness is insurance against becoming a statue.

When the building began to empty and the floor began to resemble again an industrial space in search of its correct purpose, he took his bag with its folded letter and his sore right shoe and went out into a night that had forgotten how to rain. The black car he had arrived in was not the one at the kerb; this one was cheaper and therefore kinder. Danny was not in it. A woman with plaited hair, forearms like trust, and a paperback on the seat said his name and held up a little sign anyway because fetish is part of the industry. He got in. His mother and Eva were a tangle of post-adrenaline and leftover glitter and argued about whether to stop at a motorway services and give the night one more chance to be strange. He looked out of the window at a city that was finally tired and thought of two men in coats summing their working day and going home to people who might or might not ask questions they could stand to answer.

His phone, which he had forgotten to silence because deep down he had wanted to be interrupted by something excusable, buzzed with the raw insistence of a child. A message, unknown number, the words as plain and grammatical as if they had been run through a machine that removed every flourish: Well done. It suits you. We can live with this. He nearly wrote back something barbed because barbs are fun and alarmingly easy; instead, he closed the screen and let it be as if it were weather.

He fell asleep between two women who knew his face when joy lived in it and woke when the car rolled under the big vault of Paddington again because lives have routines even after you have been kidnapped for twenty-five minutes and told philosophy through a metal grille. Bath would be there at the other end smelling of limescale and bread. The cat would jump at shadows and then forget them. The blue door would take a key like a champion. He would go to the studio above the carpet warehouse and sweep and not tell anyone he had done it, because clean floors improve the odds of good work and that’s as much magic as anybody gets.

When he unlocked the house with the blue door, very late to be dignified and very early to be safe, there was a square of paper on the mat under the post flap. He bent because bodies do that when there isn’t enough in them left to worry about traps. It was not a threat; it was a flyer that someone had pushed through on their way past, charity shop with flaking gold letters offering furniture and linen and treasures. Someone had written in the margin in a hand that might have been Mara’s and might not, bent and private and a little bit mocking of itself: Always be your own audience. He laughed, carefully, because waking your mother at two in the morning to tell her a stranger had assisted you with your existential position is rude even in a house that runs on the collapse of the fourth wall. He put the paper on the mantel between Eva’s pie and Gideon’s soft eyes and went upstairs to see if sleep would be kind.

It was, for once. When he dreamed, he was not in a van or a corridor or a room where applause tried to take the place of weather. He was in a kitchen with lino that had worn itself thin out of duty, and there was steam on the window and a kettle doing its small, serious dance. There were no men with coats. There was, however, a woman with a waist like a wasp and a laugh like tissue paper and a hand that told him where to be without embarrassment. Two steps and a turn. Two steps. Turn. If you listen, she said, you will never fall. And he woke not because the floor failed him, but because somewhere downstairs a cat leapt onto a chair and made a noise like somebody dropping a brick, which in Bath is as good a blessing as any.On Sunday the rain had done its civil morning thing and stepped back, leaving Bath rinsed and a little smug. Nathan woke to a cat landing from a wardrobe with the fatalism of a man jumping from a low wall, then performed the particular audition he held every morning now—breath, ankle, head, the latter sending up one small postcard of complaint from the place where the chloroform had turned his resistance into a rumour. The cat arranged himself on Nathan’s ribs as if inspecting foundations and purred a judgement that sounded like a saw biting through soft wood. He lay and counted the gaps between the Abbey bells and the pigeons’ arguments on the roof and let the ordinary invade his body until the night was pushed out to the skin, ready to be toweled off.

Downstairs, Mum had the banner folded into a neat square that would never again lie flat because pride warps paper. She had dismantled the glitter constellation from the cat with less success than she had predicted and the animal wore stars like a man who had not committed fully to a fancy-dress code but felt he should respect the spirit. “I told your Auntie Lorna I’d make jam tarts and now I find I’ve promised to feed the choir,” Mum said, not looking up but radiating that particular mixed signal of relief and melancholy you only learn to read in people you’ve watched when they thought no one was. “Boys from the rugby came to the shop for mince pies after the show. One of them had a cry and tried to buy a lampshade.”

“They do that when their blood sugars are low,” Nathan said, kissing the dry verge of her hair the way you take the temperature of a room with your palm. “You’ll get a plaque. Avaunt, tart queen. I saw a flyer on the mat when I came in last night. Furniture, linen, treasures. Someone has amended it.”

Mum made herself turn, which is an act at a certain age, and squinted at the flyer propped between a photograph of Gideon and a shot of Eva attempting to murder a panettone with a serrated knife. “Always be your own audience,” she read, and cocked her head. “That’s either deeply wise or something teenagers put under a picture of their knees. Who wrote that?”

“Someone with a pen,” he said, and she tutted because mothers are allergic to evasions not made by toddlers. He thought of Mara’s hand, the way she held cards like apologies. He thought of Stephen’s square on kitchen roll and the way it had been exactly the right shape for a room you could trap yourself in. He shrugged the thought off like a coat damp at the cuffs and sat to drink tea from a mug that had learned to taste of tea and no longer of clay.

Eva came with a swagger he recognized from the bakery’s Christmas rush, hung her apron on the back of a chair as if pinning a medal on a reluctant soldier, and announced that Bath had cried properly for once. “Kian sobbed and then pretended he was allergic to nutmeg,” she said, unloading a bag of cinnamon swirls as if it were contraband. “We had that quiet after the end you get at football matches where people realize their lives are not going to be solved by twelve men running into each other. It was excellent. I almost went to confession and I don’t even have a Catholic in the house to justify it.”

“You were supposed to stay where I could see you and not adopt a fire marshal,” Nathan said, taking a swirl because not taking one would have been rude to the part of the room that smelled like comfort.

“He was rude about Mum’s sandwiches,” Eva said, aggrieved. “I educated him. Also—” and here she put her hands flat on the table in the way she did when a conversation needed to be nailed in place—“the men. We will talk about the men in coats without talking about the men in coats, because we have learned that saying a thing out loud sometimes makes it bolder than it deserves to be. But I am saying this out loud anyway. If you decide we go to someone wearing a lanyard and a pension plan about it, we go together. If you decide we do not, we still do not alone. You understand me, Nate? I will not have you making a hobby of burden-hoarding.”

“Who taught you to be like this,” he asked, not, for once, meaning it as a compliment disguised as exasperation.

“You did,” she said simply, and then ruined the moment so neither of them had to cope with it by stealing half his swirl and the cat’s chair at the same time.

The bakery was a chapel the day after a miracle, filled with people unashamed of coming to be close to a piece of something they could not name. Nathan wiped a table because wiping tables is a sacrament wherever food has been served properly. He endured three versions of You should have won with the good grace of a man who had not died and can therefore accept disappointment politely. He took a photograph with a woman who had brought her mother’s spatula to show him because the woman felt it had done something spiritual with pastry and wanted a witness. Kian kept handing him things to carry which kept him busy and happy, and somewhere between the door and the till Nate saw, chalked small at knee-height on the skirting board where flour drifted like snow, a square drawn with neat hands, not big, not a threat, just there, as if an art student had thought this corner needed anchoring. He put his thumb over it and smudged nothing, which meant someone had been careful to spray fixative, and that both soothe and irk in different rooms of his chest. He said nothing because saying makes things choose a size. He carried a tray of chelsea buns that smelled like everything good he had learned to stand still for and made jokes with the customers about no dance today, only cardio by butter.

Midday brought a lull and then the swing back up the way weekends do, so he ducked out for an hour with a promise extracted from Eva that she would eat something that had not been baked by herself. He walked up to the Abbey and sat on the stone lip that kept the grass appropriate and let the tourist tide wash around him. He watched boys in hoodies exchange cans and girls in velvet coats do that exercise with their hair that means waiting has become a performance. He thought about the van and how he had not told a person with a badge. It did not feel like cowardice; it felt like keeping a piece of himself wrapped while he worked out whether it was jewellery or a blade. But he had promised, in a corner of himself that had no time for cheap vows, to tell Hesketh. Sarge had the air of a man who had lived through a decade of other people’s bad ideas and found a system for filing them that did not involve burning or denial. Nathan could trust that system to tell him if he was being proud when he needed to be sensible.

He went to the little granite slab where his gran’s name was pressed into the world and stood an appropriate distance because privacy is due even to the dead. A woman in a red coat was arranging something brave in a jam jar on the stone a few yards down and he nodded to her because Bath requires that and because grief recognises grief even when it is wearing the wrong shoes. “Thank you,” he said, very softly, because no one needed to overhear his bargaining with a memory, and then he said the stupid sentence that had more truth in it than he liked: “There were men in a van. I did not embarrass us.” The wind did its thing with his hair and he decided that counted as an answer.

In the studio over the carpet warehouse, Lina appeared as if popped out of a trunk by a conjuror, dropped her bag, kicked off her boots and became weight in the doorway that made the room feel trued. “We are doing no waltz,” she declared, dragging a chair with purposeful gracelessness to lean against the mirror. “The waltz is too polite for a day like today. We will do the rude dance. We will foxtrot and we will look at each other like two clerks in a ledger room who have decided to run away and marry marmalade.”

“I never know what you mean and then I do and it’s always too late to object,” he admitted, and her face softened because she recognized gratitude when it dressed up as resistance. They moved without music first, rehearsing weight and yes and no like a couple who had lived together too long to waste words on preference. When the music came on he let it turn the floor into something other than wood and the air into something other than air. He used his body for something that no one could bet on except the two of them. At a pause, she looked at him head to heel and back again with a professional malice that was all protection. “You are too calm to be calm,” she said. “You will tell me when you are ready the thing I already know. You have a bruise in your ears where a cloth was placed. You will say to me I am fine and I will say to you I did not ask that question. We have time because I will make some.”

“Tomorrow,” he said, and she let him have it because she loved him, not in any way that made for television, but in the only way that ever saves anyone. “I’m going to Hesketh. You can come if you want to watch him deny that his eyes have moisture in them.”

“Tomorrow,” she echoed, and then made him work so hard he had to remember to swallow between bars or turn blue for aesthetic reasons.

Monday was a training day on the rota and no one would blame him for taking it, but he went to the barracks with his bag on his back and his ankle two moods behind his jaw. The room in the admin block with the kettle and the calendar from five years ago had seen men come in with a proposal, with an apology, with an absence already arranging itself behind their mouths. Hesketh sat with a pen in his hand and an empty form in front of him as if bureaucracy grew from his very presence and had learned to wait for him to tell it what it was for. He looked up with his eyebrows already sympathetic.

“You’ve come with either a dog or a swan on your conscience,” he said, indicating the two kinds of stupidity he preferred to shepherd men away from. “Sit. Try to look like a person who trusts that furniture is real.”

Nathan told him the outline and then something of the inside because he had learned to resist the temptation to be dramatic at the expense of clarity. He said men in coats and a van that smelled of chip wrappers and a yard where damp had decided to make its home. He said Stephen without giving him the dignity of his false name and a driver with an old scar and a competence that did not want to be seen. He did not pretend he had been brave; he said he had counted the number of bolts on a roller shutter while promising a stranger something in a voice that did not shake. Hesketh listened with the small exhalations of a man learning a new tune in a key he dislikes and would nonetheless be humming by tea-time.

“You’re telling me because you know that if you don’t, the men who want you in rooms you didn’t choose get bigger and you get smaller,” Hesketh said at last, arranging the words with the care he reserved for telling lads that the reason they were called lads had ended. “You’re not calling the old bill because you know that what they’ll do is fill out a form that says the right sentences in the wrong order, and then someone will call you and ask you to identify a man you never saw in a light that never existed. You are asking me if you are being a coward or a strategist. I am telling you to make it both an act of courage and a plan. We go quiet and we go steady. We tell one person with a badge whose life has trained them not to make a noise just because there is one. We do not insult men who do this for a living by trying to do it for them, but we also do not hand your mother’s house to a story she did not write.”

“Is there such a person,” Nathan said, feeling the relief that comes when someone older than you behaves like the grown-up you secretly keep needing.

“There is a woman I went to school with who preferred trees to people until she learned she could put the latter behind the former to catch them,” Hesketh said with something like fondness colouring the sentence. “Detective Sergeant Ria Moffat. Avon and Somerset. She will not laugh at you. She will not mention dances because she has a father who thinks telly is a communist plot. She will tell you she cannot promise you anything and it will be the best promise anyone makes you this year. I’ll call her. You will answer an unknown number and you will tell her only the truth, not the extra brave bits men add when they think they sound prettier.”

“And the other thing,” Nathan said, because if you didn’t say all the dumb things out loud you ended up being their landlord. “Danny. The driver. Our Danny. The scar and the voice and the way he didn’t panic.”

Hesketh rubbed at his jaw in a way that made the younger men in the regiment sit up straighter even if he didn’t say their names. “Men like Danny are pieces in other people’s games until they realise they need to become boards. It would not surprise me if someone you know had made themselves useful in a way that keeps where they live inside their cheque book. It would also not surprise me if they had guessed, at the services, that moving too fast toward a fight would get you hit with something you couldn’t name. This is what I’m saying to you instead of smash him in a car park: I will talk to him if I can find him, and I will choose a sentence that gives him a ladder to climb out without pretending he was never in. If he refuses to climb, then we will stop holding the ladder.”

“You’ve become so gentle it scares me,” Nathan said, and Hesketh barked a laugh that made the kettle jump on its base as if it had an opinion about it.

“Gentle is what I learned when hard made no one safer,” he said. “Go on. Be seen in town. Be dull on purpose. Make it look like you have nothing to hide because you do not. That’s the petty thugs’ least favourite flavour. When Ria calls, don’t make jokes. She will like you better for not making jokes.”

He could have hugged the man and instead he saluted with a lazy precision that would have earned him a small, painful comment on parade and left the room lighter, his pockets full of instructions instead of rocks. Outside in the barracks yard, two lads were inventing a game with an old tyre and a length of rope in which the object appeared to be to fall without conceding any fear to gravity. He watched them for a minute because it was good for the soul to see foolishness immortal. He walked home by the long way because long ways are sometimes the ones that take you past the things you need to see, and because the town was a theatre he refused to let anyone else cast him in.

The package was on the step with the blue paint scuffed where eight hundred keys had missed their appointment by millimetres and his mother had said a rich and beautiful language to replace the missing wood. It was brown and ordinary and had paid its postage. Inside was not a knife or a note or a small corpse the universe had been waiting to give him. It was a book, clothbound, second-hand, with a library stamp from somewhere that smelled of old men with sandwiches in their pockets. On the flyleaf someone had written in a tidy confident hand, Hannah M. Worth your trouble. The title made him take a small breath and hold it—A Practical Grammar of Social Dancing, 1954—and the diagrams inside were so upright and earnest you wanted to apologize to them for learning to move your hips. There was no name of a sender, no card, but tucked in at the back were three sheets of notepaper with corners worn thin, containing handwritten annotations in an American hand that had come to Britain in the seventies and never left. He laughed because your life, once you let it, always started dropping the right props on your mat when you least expected them.

In the late afternoon, before the sky had decided whether it wanted to mount a proper sunset or go straight to bed, his phone did the thing phones do when they are about to become plot devices and displayed a name he had been trying not to summon. Mara said hello as if they were in a queue with bad lighting, as if she were wearing a coat she disliked and wanted to discuss it, as if nothing serious had ever been said near her because that was the safest way to say serious things. She asked him how his lungs were and he told her honestly and she believed him because he did not put extra adjectives on them to make them more interesting.

“I was going to take you to a cafe with waiters who have developed a theory of coffee and a wall covered in bicycles that don’t mean anything,” she said. “Instead, I’ll tell you a small story in a voice that fits in your room. Once, early on, when I was all mouth and dress and nothing in me that could lift my own weight, a man in a very expensive jacket told me that if I wore a certain colour and smiled a certain way he could guarantee a number that would absolve me of all the debts in my body. He said it so quietly I nearly told him yes by accident because saying no would have made us both attend to the fact of a person in a room with a demand. I said no. I threw up afterwards because the body punishes you for choosing yourself when it has been trained not to. Nothing exploded. His wife called me a year later to ask if I would sign a hat for a charity auction. The world is not neat. I tell you this because you looked like a man the other night who had said no and kept all his parts assembled.”

“There was a square on kitchen roll,” he said, because only to her did that sentence feel like he would be understood without footnotes. “They will be patient.”

“Then we will be more patient,” she said, and he heard, not for the first time, the steel in the laughter she sold for a living. “Say the detective’s name slowly into your pillow and maybe the pillows gods will be kind and put her brain in your path more often than your enemies manage to roll a van. And if you need a little bit of the small power I have to be wasted in the right direction, you can have it. I am not generous for free. I want to go on knowing the man who used his hands as if they weren’t an apology.”

He wanted to ask her whether the flyer’s handwriting had been hers and did not because the better way to keep a magic trick is to refuse to ask the magician where the rabbit went. He thanked her the way you thank the person who holds the door of a church when you’re uncertain about entering. They said the normal things then because normal things are how you get out of conversations alive. When he put the phone down, he found that a particular knot in his stomach had undone itself with a modest flourish and gone to see if it could be useful to someone else.

At dusk he went out and found the charity shop with the flaking gold sign that persisted in listing treasure as something you could put on a shelf. The bell on the door was a real bell that had been demoted from somewhere nicer. Inside, the air smelled of old linen and coats that had been to fireworks and weddings. He laughed out loud because on a table someone had stacked a tower of silver-framed photographs, all of them containing strangers on beaches with the sky being brave, and at the bottom, as if fate had a sense of humour, was a picture of a boy with a haircut like a penalty with a woman whose waist would have shamed an illustrator, dancing in a kitchen. It wasn’t his Gran—wrong wallpaper, wrong dog—but the photograph had caught laughter in the act of making itself useful. He bought it and an absurd bow tie that could anchor no one’s neck and a record with a torn sleeve that claimed to contain four foxtrots at a tempo recommended by men in the fifties who had survived a war and refused to be bored by counting.

He took them home under his coat because rain had changed its mind at the last minute and decided to come after all. Mum had retired to bed with a murder she disapproved of, and the house had the sound it gets when your mother is present but not watchful; the air becomes humane. He set the little record player he had impulsively rescued at the till onto the old sideboard that had resisted so many fads and coaxed the needle to believe in itself. The first song came out with a hiss like a rumour and then settled into being music you could trust. He didn’t turn on any more lamps than he had to. He danced alone because that is a skill no one gives you a trophy for and is absolutely necessary if you are going to live to seventy without becoming suspicious of your own heart. The cat made a decision about legs that had nothing to do with art and nearly killed them both. He laughed because ridiculousness belongs to the righteous.

When the phone rang again at nine, an unknown number did not lift his hackles because he had trained them not to, and a woman said her name was Moffat, and that Hesketh had told her he was the sort of man who could listen without making a story out of what he heard. He told her the short version, and then the medium, and when she asked for the long he enjoyed the fact that he could tell it to her in full and not have it become ammunition. She asked him things good men forget to ask themselves, like what time the USP truck had gone past at the services because the cameras that watched it might have seen a piece of van that was supposed to be invisible, and whether he had any sensation of the van’s wheel wobble that suggested a bad alignment you could hear later on a CCTV clip, and whether Danny had a wedding ring and if so which way he turned it when he spoke. He told her what he knew and where he fluffed and she said, “Thank you,” in a tone that did not overpay or underpay him. Before she rang off she said, “I will likely ring you at odd hours and sound more tired than is appropriate. You are allowed to not answer me. If you do, I will not turn your life into a manhunt. I am allergic to showbusiness and I am not idiotic. I am however keen not to let men who think it is funny to reverse engineering outcomes feel that the police have sat down to have a beef sandwich while justice happens elsewhere.”

Afterwards, he took the book from the packet and sat in the corner where Gran would have sat if she had been manufactured out of current matter and ran his fingers over the diagrams. On page thirty-three a man with a heroic haircut had his hand at the right angle to a woman who had learned cheekbones as if they were a language, and the caption said The Man Guides: Firm, Not Stern. He whispered, “Yes,” to the air, and put the book down on the little table that had received so many letters and bills and divinations from tea cups and let his house be a house again, not a place where threat made decisions about size.

He slept the kind of sleep that is not a gift but a negotiation. Somewhere in the morning a fox shouted and a bus changed gear and the cat muttered something that would have been actionable if translated into human. In the dream he did not go to the van; he went to the kitchen; he took two steps and turned, because that is the first thing anyone should learn. In waking, he thought: patience then; rooms; ladders. He got up and strapped his ankle the way a man who has made peace with a body does and went downstairs to boil a kettle because somewhere in the world there was a detective on a bicycle and a man with an old scar and a driver who had to decide whether he wanted to be called Danny again by a woman with forearms that told the truth for a living. The morning lay ahead of him like a street with little squares of chalk on it, polite and dangerous, and he was, for once, amused at the prospect of walking it.On Tuesday Bath did that thin, decent sunlight that makes the city’s stone look like a memory of summer, and in it Nathan felt both overexposed and absurdly safe, like a man in a play wearing armour made of pewter. He took his tea to the back step and watched the cat reconnoitre the bins with a professional nose, then he read two pages of the old dance grammar as if it were scripture from a denomination he did not belong to and could nonetheless admire. The diagrams calmed him. The certainty of arrows appealed; someone had once believed bodies could be arranged without surprise. He closed the book when he heard his mother humming in the hallway, a tune with no origin that had travelled down women in his family until it came out of a throat that had never chosen it.

Detective Sergeant Moffat called with a time and a place in a tone that made the instructions feel like options, which Nathan appreciated. She chose a cafe on the river that did not try to be anything other than a place for tea and a roll; the sort of room where the staff look at your face and decide whether to give you privacy or chatter based on their read of your eyebrows. She was in the corner with her back to the wall and the menu already memorised, hair tied with what looked like a shoelace that had made peace with its new life. Her jacket had seen rain and done the decent thing. She looked like someone who had learned to find the least creaky step in any house and to befriend it.

“You’re taller than your voice,” she said, as if that were data. “I’m going to speak as if we have known each other for years because men tell me things when they think I will not be impressed by their height. Tea?”

“You have a terrifying bedside manner for a woman whose bed is a desk,” Nathan said, and then straightened his mouth because he had promised Hesketh to keep the charm on a shorter leash. “Please. Tea. And whatever you order that comes with butter.”

She ordered scones as if this were part of police procedure in Avon and Somerset and a kettle clicked somewhere behind a low partition with the tenderness of someone deciding to make something right. She put a notepad on the table but did not uncap her pen yet; people relax when ink delays its entrance. When she spoke, it was the voice of a woman with a hobby of building bridges where other people had thought the river meant you could not cross. She asked him to go through his account again and he did not resent it; repetition had washed the fear out of the story and left something serviceable behind.

“You are very clear on what you don’t know,” she said when he had finished. “Appreciated. People who come to me loving their own guesses make my life a little longer and a lot less useful. First: services. Membury. I can get cameras; they will be poor and grumpy because cameras at services are meant to convince teenagers not to do doughnuts, not catch men with tidy coats. But a licensing body placed a new pole there I can talk to. Second: your driver. You did not ring him because you do not know how to speak to him without either forgiving him or hitting him, and you are not in the mood for either. I will talk to him. Third: the yard. You’ve given me a run of landmarks that are like the bad directions uncles give, but you described the way the road sang in the van, and that might save us time. There’s a stretch under a viaduct on the A4 where a wheel alignment will hum a D. I’ll take a man out and make him drive it. We will look stupid. He will still love me because the alternative is paperwork.”

Nathan ate a bite of scone and discovered he was starving. The butter had been cut with a knife that cared. The river outside was doing the work of rivers, pretending they are always going somewhere as if eternity needed rehearsing. “They drew a square,” he said, and waited for her to ask why that mattered.

She did not. She looked pleased with herself for not interrupting him. “Of course they did. They told you the room you are allowed to move in. You smudge them when you can. You do not do it where it will make them change size. You can send me photographs of every square you find; that is not me being mystical, that is me knowing half the men who get clever like to leave fingerprints where they think they’re being elegant. Elegance is vain. Vanity is sloppy.”

“Lina says she will glue their shoes to a floor if they come again,” he said, and DS Moffat smiled with her mouth in a way her eyes refused to join.

“She is my favourite kind of civilian. No glue. We do boring things instead. I will ask you a more boring favour. If anyone approaches you—anyone—with an offer couched in kindness, you will give me the call log before you decide how polite to be. If anyone so much as carries your bag at a station and uses your name with a delay that suggests they have practised, you will pretend you have to go to the men’s. Then you will ring me. You will ring me even if I am asleep. You will ring me especially if I am asleep.”

“I’m going to London Wednesday for a thing that isn’t a thing,” he said. “Somebody wants a segment at a charity lunch where looking like you’re not eating is half the brief. They send a driver. The driver will not be Danny because I think someone in the building went home and binned a Rolodex after I was late to my own final.”

“Perhaps write down number plates as if you are fourteen and trying to impress your little cousin,” she said. “I have a man who can make a database sing arias. It looks like a toy until it does something. You are not wrong to be suspicious of cars. Men with vans are not cleverer than men with clipboards; they just wear worse shoes. We catch them with the same net if we’re careful.”

“What do I do about the part where I would like to tell someone who can arrest someone and have them arrest someone,” he asked, aware he was talking like his mother’s generation, who still thought doorbells meant people.

“You do not insult me by pretending you don’t already know the answer,” she said, and finally uncapped her pen like a little coronation. “We go slow enough to not lose our place. We do not tell them we are coming; we take their dinner out of the oven while they are chatting over the fence. We do not go to the press because the press likes the story more than it likes you. We go to the licensing body and the man with the pole. We go to the man with the scar. We go to Danny, who might be about to choose being small forever or being useful once and not sleeping for a fortnight. We go to your van boys at a pace that suggests we are bored by them, which will insult them more than any of the colourful adjectives in your friend’s arsenal.”

He paid because he was not going to argue with a woman whose work would be to argue with men all day. She permitted it because allowing men kindness is a gift you have to parcel out carefully or they come to expect bows. When he stood, she did too, and he noticed she had chosen shoes that could run. Her phone vibrated; she glanced; she smiled without moving her cheeks. “Good,” she said. “A lorry driver at Membury can see license plates in his sleep. He is going to be my friend for the price of a bacon bap. Off you go. If you find a square, don’t kick it. Be pleased you see it.”

Once you have told a thing to an authority who doesn’t turn it into theatre, the air around it moves to a different temperature. Nathan walked the long way back past Pulteney Bridge and looked at the old curve the way you look at a person who has aged into something like mercy. He stopped to watch a man in a suit try to eat chips elegantly and fail; he did not apologise for watching. He let himself be proud for a quarter-hour, not of the dance or the courage or any of the stupid nouns people had been pinning to his lapel in messages that used too many heart emojis. He was proud of the bit where he had not tried to be the only adult in a room. It is a skill you do not get taught in any of the institutions he had passed through.

At the bakery a woman with a microphone on a stick as if she were going to fish for trout drifted past the door three times and then came in because her producer had been impatient in her ear. Eva saw her, appraised her, and decided she was not a threat to the till or to Kian’s adolescent composure. “We sell pastries and we do not sell anguish,” she said, wiping her hands on a cloth that had survived wars. “If you want anguish you go to the supermarket. They have it prepackaged.”

The reporter softened because being deflected with humour is a mercy, and Nathan thought: this is how you keep a world. You do not fight every little battle; you turn a few into jokes, and you pick the ones you will stand on with your full weight and become stone.

They trained that afternoon in a room that had somehow acquired two extra mirrors while he was asleep and he could not tell whether the change was physical or the simple result of having been seen by too many cameras. Lina ran him through steps as if she were reading him a recipe over the phone while chopping onions with one hand. “You do too much when you are trying to look like you are doing nothing,” she said, and then accepted that she was not being particularly useful and patted his cheek. “Your body doesn’t lie to me. If you lie to me with your mouth again about the van, you will step on your own foot and I will have it on record that you have assaulted yourself.”

“Sergeant Moffat has very likely frightened the lorry drivers of West Berkshire into becoming spies,” he said. “I admire her. She asked me for number plates and I felt a rush I have never felt in the presence of a spreadsheet.”

“We are doing risers tomorrow,” she said in the tone of a woman who understood her own confession will never come. “We must trust the men who bring them not to take away a screw just for fun because they are bored. You must trust gravity not to be personal.”

“You asking for too much,” he said, and she kissed his jaw because it was a way to tell him she had noticed the light behind his eyes had stayed on since Saturday and he should probably turn it down before it burned the socket.

That night there were three more squares. One appeared chalked low on the skirting board of the studio in a corner that collected dropped hair pins; one was on the backside of a street sign near the bus station where the boys rode wheelies; one was on the brickwork near his mother’s house in a place a drunk might have leaned and imagined himself safe. He saw them because his eye had been taught to see them, which made his skin itch with the sensation of being trained by strangers. He took photographs not because he needed to but because sending them to Moffat would make the squares move out of his head and onto someone else’s desk. He refused to feel cleaned by the act; he refused to let satisfaction do that trick sinister men love where it turns people into spectators of their own lives.

Moffat texted to say “Good,” to the photographs and then “Under a camera,” and then “Lazy,” which made him hope someone had been caught at a pixel count he could respect. She did not gush. The last message: “He will speak. Not quickly. Not in a way a microphone would catch. But he will.”

She meant Danny. It turned out that men like Danny could be found if you asked the right question of an MOT man with a good memory for a particular set of cheap tyres, and if you looked at supermarket car parks with your head tilted so the pattern emerged. Moffat went herself with a uniform colleague who had perfected the art of appearing to be a less competent policeman than he was, which calmed men who thought they liked to fool the police. They found Danny sitting in the driver’s seat of a car that was not black and not hired and had a small chipped lucky coin in its ashtray that had migrated from a car fourteen years older because men who did not believe in blessings still did not throw such coins away. The scar down his jaw looked grumpier in daylight, as if it had opinions about his decision-making.

She did not ask the first question men expect from police. She complimented his parking because it was tidy and then she asked him if he had eaten and he said yes in the way men say yes when they mean if a biscuit fell into my pocket I would keep it. She gave him a ginger biscuit on the grounds that if you give men other flavours they think you are trying to make them eat root vegetables with spice, and then she said, “You are in a story you do not want to see yourself aged in. Come out now and you will be older for kinder reasons.”

He put his head back on the headrest. “You could arrest me,” he said, because that’s how simple men want the world to be in the moments they’re tempted to be better. “I picked the lad up and drove. I saw enough films to know that counts.”

“I could put a lot of men in paperwork prison,” she said. “It does not always get me the thing I need most, which is the next person up the chain. Tell me a place. Or a name. Or a habit, even. I will take something you can say without turning your stomach inside out.”

He nodded once, because it is a relief to be asked for less than heroism by a woman who is clearly tired of performing it for other people’s benefit. He told her where the van had stopped, and what the yard kept on its walls, and that the man who had sat in the passenger seat had used too much hand cream for somebody who claimed he mended radios, and that the maps on the wall were old enough to make the names of places feel like declarations. He did not say Stephen because he had not been given the name and because he was not prepared to give a man a name he had not earned by saying it in his own mouth first. He said, “I told them we didn’t do bodies and I meant it,” and Detective Sergeant Moffat believed him enough to tell him to go home and put a chair under something and then to go to a job that involved driving people with ordinary lives to ordinary destinations and to avoid black cars with opinions if he could.

On Wednesday, because her texts made the world seem less like a performance for a wide audience and more like a conversation between two people who had met on a staircase and liked the view, Mara asked Nathan if she could borrow him for twenty minutes after his charity lunch thing that wasn’t a thing. He agreed because he had discovered that one way to make danger small is to put a famous person in front of it like a taller child in a school photograph. They met in a corridor of the hotel that had confused the colour beige with a creed and then realised halfway through its decorative philosophy that it might have been happier in lemon. She was eating a small cake out of a napkin and trying to keep it off her mouth with admirable but doomed concentration. She held out a hand full of crumbs as if she were offering him communion.

“I thought of you when someone told me a story about patience,” she said, swiping the side of her mouth with a finger that the make-up woman would probably want to tackle with a brush in a minute. “Not the sort where you behave because you’ll be rewarded. The sort where you decide not to give a thing your expression because you refuse to enlarge it with your face. They come back if you don’t feed them. Everything from foxes to ex-husbands—no, not me, calm down, the tabloids will write me as a jealous tree while we’re still breathing—will eventually seek easier bins.”

“You’re telling me to wait,” he said, because he had practised that and liked the way waiting looked in his mouth now it had been associated with action.

“I’m telling you to dance and make it look like an insult to the men who thought they could make you sit down,” she said. “And I’m telling you a thing for which I am not going to charge you because I am feeling like a benefactor. The sponsor—bless their greedy hearts—want to put you in an advert in March. It pays in a way that would make the cat’s diet upgrade. You have to decide whether you want to be on a bus stop catching a cold at two in the morning. I cannot tell you whether doing it makes you more or less a person. But not deciding will make you poor and tense. Decide. I am not kind to dithering men.”

He did the thing he had learned to do when a person who lives in a bright box asks him a question he does not know how to answer properly: he pictured the blue door, the silly cat, the glue on the table that would never come off, the record with the foxed sleeve, and allowed the right desire to step forward. He could brand a piece of himself without selling all of it; he would have to keep the good part somewhere a camera would not find. “I’ll do it if we can put the words Always be your own audience on the wall somewhere in small letters,” he said, and her face did a pleased trick that would have launched a thousand truly terrible thinkpieces.

“You’re going to become the kind of annoying man who makes me cry at buses,” she said. “Fine. We’ll hide it in a frame on the wall behind your shoulder. The person who needs it will see it. No one else will understand why we’re smiling.”

He noticed then that she had a square drawn on her wrist in biro, small and imperfect, which made his stomach do a quick, ugly flip. She saw him see it and lifted her wrist and kissed the square as if it were a bruise that belonged to someone else. “I prefer tattoos,” she said lightly. “But this will do for an afternoon. It’s a reminder. They don’t own the rooms. We do. Even when we are only renting.”

He laughed because to hesitate in a corridor with a famous woman and a biro drawing a symbol that had been used to menace you felt like a parody of threat. They parted with two hands on two shoulders, like reasonable people reassuring each other the street was where they had left it.

Nathan’s mother agreed to the advert because she had found mould in a corner behind a bookcase that she was not going to confess had been there for months, and mould is a persuasive lobbyist. Kian promised to become a creative director for fifteen minutes and drafted slogans that would have caused both the sponsor and God to apologise; Eva told him he was going to lose the bakery’s more delicate customers if he allowed that much sincerity to appear on the side of a bus. Gideon’s photograph on the mantel acquired a piece of ribbon for no good reason; the cat attempted to eat it and was dissuaded by physics and the insult of the thing.

On Thursday night Bath smelled of damp leaves and the cold coins in the pockets of men who stand outside pubs making decisions that have nothing to do with their wives. Nathan walked home the long way with his hood up and his hands in his pockets and counted four squares and allowed himself one derisive grin because someone had done a poor job with one and had had to correct their chalk mid-stroke. He took a photograph of the messy square and sent it to Moffat with the caption: Sloppy. Her reply came back with suspicious speed for a woman who had implied she never slept. “Losing interest,” she wrote. “Or recruiting children. Both good signs.”

He slept, dreamless or at least without a dream he could remember in daylight, and woke to find that Bath had decided to behave like a toy town again, the river low, the pigeons sure of themselves, the buses considering themselves important. He went to the studio and found a new notice pinned to the corkboard in the corridor that served all the rooms above the carpet warehouse, photocopied a long time ago and still white enough to glare: FLOOR IS A TRUST. That was all. No one owned the sentiment; no name at the bottom. He smiled and put his thumb briefly to the page as if it could tell the difference between him and some other man who had also needed the reminder.

Detective Sergeant Moffat rang him just after lunch. She had the sound in her voice of someone who has found a piece of string and is tugging it, not hard, not yet, delighted in the simple fact that the string moved at all. “Your map with a D hum was right,” she said. “The yard belongs to a man who lends his name to other men who don’t like forms. We have their numberplate leaving at a time that has the decency to be plausible. Don’t prick up. That’s not the same as don’t care. Go about your business in a way that could bore a saint. I will take this somewhere sensible and pretend I got it by doing crosswords and not by asking my friend’s brother who drives a lorry. If anyone posts you a square on paper, keep it. Don’t set it on fire. That way you aren’t tempted to notice whether the smoke smells like anything you’ve smelled before.”

“Am I going to be asked to identify a man in a coat in a room where the chairs are too tall for the table,” he asked, and she made a noise that sounded like a kind of laugh that had sat down out of respect for seriousness.

“I wouldn’t insult you,” she said. “No lineups that look like television. If it comes to that we’ll do it like decent people, with cognisance of memory and light and the unreliability of humans. And if it doesn’t come to that we’ll take the tyres off a van and count the stones in the treads for where they’ve been, and make a judge listen to the sound of a wheel singing at a certain speed under a viaduct, and call it an education. There are days this job is just asking men to pay attention to the world they live in. I enjoy those days more than the ones where somebody’s father thinks I am ruining his boy’s prospects.”

“I’m not going to call you at two in the morning just to tell you I can still breathe,” he said, and she hummed as if this were generosity she could accept.

“You can,” she said. “I will be awake. I chose a life where sleep is what my sister has so I can borrow it when I stay at her house. Try to save your mercy for the morning, if you can. Go and dance at someone for free today. It will make my work feel less like a repetition and more like a human choice.”

He did. He went to the mobility class at the leisure centre where old men with great knees and terrible shoulders come to collectively decide they can still reach the top shelf if they have to, and he led them through two steps and a turn and everyone looked foolish and redeemed in equal measure. One of them had been a painter and decorator with more paint on his boots than on the walls and he said, “This is not music, son,” and Nathan said, “We’ll get there,” and the woman on the far side of the room who had a cardigan with a button in the wrong place said, “It’s always music if you decide it,” and there it was, the thing Moffat had promised: the day made into a choice.

Danny put a letter through the blue door on Friday like a man who had finally worked out which step creaked least and used it. The envelope was cheap, the way people choose envelopes when they don’t usually own paper and feel silly standing in shops looking at quality. Inside was not a confession a court would accept or a name a judge would recognise. Inside was a petrol receipt folded into quarters with two numbers written on the back, one of them a date that made the hairs on Nathan’s arm try to sit up, one of them a sequence that did not mean a plate or a phone, not at first. Under the numbers, one sentence: We are not lions. The handwriting looked like a mechanic had taken a course on penmanship and quit halfway through because the tutor had been patronising.

Nathan did not ring Moffat. He walked the twenty minutes to Hesketh because he knew his own weaknesses and one of them had always been the desire to finish the puzzle before showing anyone else the lid of the box. Hesketh looked at the paper, at the numbers, at Nathan’s mouth while it shaped the word receipt as if to make sure the man would not start producing sonnets on the subject, and then he did the thing that had made him worth giving your life to: he did not pretend to know what it meant. He rang Moffat himself and said, “The good kind of bone,” and she arrived with her shoelace and her pen uncapped and Danishes in a bag because she assumed men would not eat unless bribed with sugar.

“It’s a ferry crossing,” she said five minutes later, chewing through a bit of paper in the way detectives have been chewing paper since God made pulp. “The sequence is a crossing number. Someone went to Calais in a vehicle that shouldn’t have left the country. Someone is comfortable using borders. This is not small. Good,” and she looked at Nathan as if he were a boy who had brought her a stone and been correct about it being interesting.

“Do you arrest him now for the letter,” Nathan said, because the longer you sit in rooms with policemen the more ridiculous questions you feel licensed to ask.

“You can’t arrest a man for being clever on paper,” she said. “Also, you do not punish a person who has located the right part of their conscience and used it. You give them a cup of tea and tell them their scar looks distinguished. We call the ferry company and pretend to be men whose job it is to check things. We get plates. We get the colour of a van. We bring your yard and your viaduct and your humming wheel and a ferry port into a nice neat row of facts that do not require me to ask twelve-year-olds to describe faces.” She stood and patted his shoulder in a way that felt like being knighted by a woman who had no time for swords. “Well done. Now go home before I begin to like you and then I’ll be forced to pretend otherwise.”

He left the admin block lighter, the slip of petrol paper folded in his pocket as if it were a piece of grace he had earned by not making himself taller than other people’s competence. Bath looked ordinary again, which is what it does for the good and the bad; it absorbs drama and issues you a chair. He walked past the charity shop and went in and bought a sugar bowl for no reason because it was shaped like something unhelpful and his mother would enjoy loving it despite its flaws. The bell over the door rang like a polite animal and nobody chalked anything on the skirting board while he was there, which he took as a win.

He met Lina at the studio and they did the aggravating task of talking through bookings for a tour that would take them to towns that had ordinariness down to an art. She had plotted the cheap trains against the expensive ones because she had finally admitted she had better things to do than save twelve pounds and lose four hours of her life to delays near Didcot. “Felton tried to ask if he could come see us in Cardiff,” she said. “I told him the venue had a dress code that forbade men with voices like paperwork. He said he didn’t understand and I had the rare pleasure of saying ‘No’ and disconnecting the call.”

“He’ll marry someone who will make him fun,” Nathan said, and she frowned with theatrical disgust.

“They will both die,” she said. “And it will be my fault. Do your heel. You are sloppier than you think.”

He did his heel until it remembered the correct way to obey gravity’s laws without looking like a supplicant. The light outside the windows went from winter to the suggestion of later months and for ten minutes he let it convince him he would warm again.

They finished and did the boring work of wiping down the mirrors and making sure the speaker cables wouldn’t invent a fire while they were away. When they went down the stairs together in the warm companionable quiet that follows shared labour, he stopped halfway because a small thing had shifted on the landing: a square chalked delicately, not by the usual hand, nested inside another. It was neat, precise, the work of someone who had held a ruler to brick and used it. In the centre, a circle; in the circle, a dot. Lina crouched, made a sceptical sound, and wiped her thumb across it. It did not smudge. She sniffed it like a woman whose grandmother had taught her to smell spices before buying them. “Wax,” she said. “Not chalk. They want it to stay.”

“Do I take a picture and flirt with a detective over text,” he asked, and she did that Polish lifting of the eyebrows that could have been wreaths at a patriotic funeral.

“You take a picture and send it because if you flirt with her she will arrest you,” she said. “I like her. She looks like a person who has built a house for herself in a world of rented rooms. The circle means they think they have found the point. We show them that maths is a trick.”

He sent the photo. Moffat replied slower this time and with less delight. “Not them,” she wrote. “Copycat or message from a different choir. Circle is not their habit. Keep. Ignore in public. We will have a conversation in private when the person who drew it finds they’ve delivered no panic.”

The last night of the week he had a dream that did not involve vans or squares or the indignities of men with coats. He dreamed the Abbey emptied itself of tourists and a woman sang in Welsh like a river with stones in it and he danced very small in the nave because there is a particular holiness to moving immodestly in a room designed to shame you. When he woke he smelled yeast and cinnamon and the indefinite smell that means somebody you love is sorting the cutlery drawer with unnecessary fury. He went downstairs and found his mother making sandwiches as if a platoon had been promised lunch any minute and Eva sitting with a glass of wine she would pretend was difficult but was in fact the sort she likes because it tastes like fruit.

“We are going to Cardiff tomorrow,” Eva said, because she had decided to become his road manager in the way families appoint themselves to parts of your life and then perform them with great seriousness. “I have made a schedule that allows for three motorway disasters, one unplanned interview, two posh women who will pretend they know you and one man we will have to shake off with sly speed. Kian has made a cake that will break some rules of physics and perhaps a tooth.”

“Detective Moffat says the men will be patient,” Nathan said. “They will wait and watch and I will not entertain them because even malevolent audiences do not deserve to be kept.”

“We should hire her to start doing the bakery rotas,” Eva said. “She would terrify suppliers into punctuality and the flour would never clog again.” She put the wine down and looked at him with the full force of the authority she did not have to cite to be obeyed. “You will tell me when she tells you to do a thing and I will not argue with her. I will only argue with wicked men in coats and anyone trying to sell you protein powder. Those are my enemies this week.”

He put the old dance book next to the plate of little cakes like an elderly relative who had earned a seat at the table and would not overawe the more fashionable guests. He did not touch his phone for an hour. He listened to the noise of his house, which has always been the thing he liked most about it—the small undermusic of a place doing its job without fuss. He let it collect around him until the urge to do something dramatic was soothed into something better. Outside, on the blue door, chalk waited to drop on the shoulder of any man who leaned the wrong way to eavesdrop. Inside, he did two steps and a turn on lino that had already forgiven him everything he had ever done to it in stubbornness, in pride, in fear.

Cardiff was what cities are when you are there to work: roads and a room and a particular version of air. In the van out there—which was not his van, which smelled like someone else’s breakfast and receipts for cones of chips—he made Kian laugh with a story about Felton attempting to say the word chassé and ending up somewhere he had no map for. They crossed the bridge and the river widened and the weather shrugged like it knew what country they were in and was going to keep the secret. Nathan watched the lanes, the verges, the number plates, the square of road that belonged to them and no one else, for a while; then he slept because there is nothing as political and as private as a nap next to people who already know the shape of your mouth when it droops.

The venue had that odd comfort of theatres built in the nineties; someone had thrown a lot of carpet at the problem of sound and had succeeded in muffling ambition as well. Men in black moved chairs the way butlers move secrets. Lina found a coffee that made her consider forgiving a snub from last week, and they did their bit, their twenty minutes of telling strangers’ bodies how to trust them. Afterwards, in the corridor, a woman cried because she had learned in public that her hip could still make a certain circle without telling her the story about being old that everyone had handed her like a pamphlet. He had no square in his line of sight for the first time in days, and he knew better than to make a wish on that absence.

They got home late with a cake that had survived the motorway only by sheer aggressive team spirit, and when they turned the blue door and went in, Mum was asleep and the cat was in possession of the living room armchair like a syndic. On the floor, under the table, there was a paper bag from the charity shop with gold flaking in a way that looked almost deliberate. Inside, wrapped in tissue that had done duty at twenty parties, there was a vinyl single with no label, just a hand-scratched note in ink that had bled: Two steps. Turn. He put it on the player and the needle made an old noise and then a new one, and he took two steps, and turned, and did not plan the next two, and found, as he always did when he let this happen, that the floor had been waiting patiently to tell him what to do. Someone had posted him a room and he had accepted it, which is as much grace as the week was prepared to offer.Morning carried a brightness like a held breath, thin and particular, the kind that makes even a teabag look deliberate. Nathan woke with the word turn in his mouth and the song still in the grooves of his ribs, the small record’s hiss lingering as if it had become an appliance of the house. The cat, bored of his own legend, kneaded a jumper as if to work grief out of it and then sat with his back to the room in that way which implies working men are being judged and should be grateful for it. He boiled a kettle because the day requires rituals and because the whistle of water at the edge of a boil had always sounded to him like a piece of advice he could use. He let the steam make a small theatre of the light and thought about squares, not as shackles but as frames, and the places where you could choose to step outside without alerting anyone to the fact of your treachery.

It had taken him three days to say the whole of it to Lina without apologising for either the fear or the parts he had found funny at the time, and when he did, she had done him the service of not rearranging her face into sympathy. She had listened with her eyebrows kept in the neutral position she reserved for businessmen and pain, then she had stood up and said, very quietly and with the efficiency of a note pinned to a child’s coat, that if he ever let a person put cloth over his mouth again while she had a working pair of hands she would deport herself. He believed her, not because she was violent but because she had a priest’s intolerance for ritual cruelty and would find the administrative route to hell if necessary. Afterwards they practised until sweat made sense of their bodies and then she forced him to eat a potato, which felt like a punishment he accepted as a kindness. When she left she put both palms on either side of his face and said into his skin that he was not allowed to become a room other people locked themselves in, which was the kind of sentence you could get drunk on if you weren’t careful.

Detective Sergeant Moffat’s messages came like a metronome with particular tastes, every one of them doing an amount of work disproportionate to its size. She had pulled the thread on the ferry receipt until it led to a man who lent vans to other men without asking why they wanted an extra lock on the inside, and she had done it with the bureaucratic glee of a person who enjoys forms when they hurt the right people. She had told him to sit very still while she introduced a licensing officer to the concept of curiosity, and he had sat very still in the way that involves going to the shop and buying loo roll and remembering to send his auntie a photograph of the Abbey because she liked to look at stone when her joints were bad. When she finally asked whether he would be willing to wear a microphone at a lunch he had to attend anyway because the head of a car company wanted to stand near an ex-soldier who was photogenic, he said yes without dressing the word in heroism. He asked whether the microphone would make him feel like a magician or a liar, and she said a little of both and then apologised for the glue.

The advert meeting was in a room that wanted to be a gallery and had been defeated by budget and a plant that had taken against the heating. The creative director was a man who had learned to say sincere with his front teeth, and his assistant had eyeliner so exact it could have solved minor crimes unaided. They wanted Nathan on a bus stop at two in the morning looking like the train had left without him and he was the kind of man who could tell you that was all right, and they wanted Lina in the corner of the frame as a rumor of competence for those who looked properly. He said the sentence about his own audience in a voice designed not to startle anyone who had brought a brief to the table with both hands, and there was a silence in the room for three seconds where you could have placed a glass and drunk from it. Then the assistant said that tiny texts make brands feel like secrets, and the creative director let himself be persuaded because the day had already asked him to be brave twice. They found a frame behind a fake fern and gave a junior designer the job of hiding letters at a size that would require intent to find, and Nathan felt a satisfaction tidy as a cufflink click when he saw it in the mock-up, small as prayer and more useful.

There was a square drawn on the back of the call sheet in pencil, small and smug, done by a hand that knew better and had chosen not to try, and he bent as if to tie a lace and drew a line through one of the sides until the square had become a skewed box that looked less like authority and more like a teenager’s idea of a room. Mara arrived late in a coat that had made a promise to behave and was reneging elegantly, and she took in the plant, the square, the man with teeth, the tiny text on the mock-up, and lifted her chin in a way that suggested the day belonged to her as soon as she had time to collect it. On her wrist the biro square had faded to a smudge, and in its place was a small requisite scratch where a bracelet had failed to be polite. She read the hidden line in the mock-up and laughed without noise, and later, while a camera looked at her as if she were light, she put the pad of her ring finger against the frame where the words were and left a small, entirely private blessing.

London did what it does when you ask it to pretend to be cosy and produced a rain that made everyone’s hair fail in the same unflattering direction. Nathan met Moffat outside a hotel where the carpets had given up and the staff had not, and she gave him a microphone in a case that could have housed a more expensive sin and told him that most men who forget they are wearing one start to whisper at the exact wrong moment. He promised to keep his voice where she could catch it and not anywhere else, and he took the long route through the foyer because walking like an ordinary person is half the game. The sponsor shook his hand with the devotion of a man finally allowed to tick a name off a laminated wish-list, and three different people called him a hero in three different intonations, none of which had anything to do with him. He put the weight of the tiny machine in the notch of his sternum and allowed it to record the idiocy of canapés and a man who had turned networking into a pattern you could print and sell.

Men in coats, or the suggestion of them, were not in the room, and that was the first thing to make him feel unsteady, as if he had expected an antagonist to come out from behind a potted plant on the third beat. Instead there was a woman with a necklace like a small conspiracy and a laugh that told him she had never given up a table to anyone in her life, and she told him in an undertone that her niece adored his partner and that boys in her school would be better at being human if taught tango. He said something about quickstep and the way it rewrites shame if you let it, and the woman put her head to one side as if he had offered her a new word for an old ache. By the time the pudding had been praised and the microphone was back in a case, he had learned the names of two men who liked vans, one charity that did not check its donors, and the single loud fact that nobody wanted to say the word betting where a camera could overhear it. He took Moffat a list of understatements, and she looked at it with the air of a gardener given a bucket of bulbs just before the first frost.

The different choir, as Moffat had called them, made their introduction in a manner that was not a manner at all but a leaflet. It slid into the bakery door the way good weather does, unannounced and almost indecently cheerful, thick paper, clean font, no logo, a graph so neat even Eva approved the axes. It knew how to speak in bullet points to men who felt they had never been written to by a system except to be told off, and it said that television that includes public votes can be daddy to three kinds of trouble, and that Nathan was welcome to speak to a reporter with a woman’s name who had a reputation for smiling at liars and walking away. There was a small circle drawn inside the square printed at the bottom edge of the leaflet, and a dot in the centre like a pupil, and he held the page like it had temperature. He did not ring the number, because patience had, in the last week, begun to feel like a sport at which he might not be entirely incompetent. He put the leaflet in the drawer where the warranty for the kettle lived and told his mother they had been invited to be sensible by the wrong people.

Danny was a voice before he was a face again, a voice on a payphone that should not have existed in the year, threaded through a confusion of static and the small criminal sound of people dropping change. He said he couldn’t talk and then did, because people always begin with their own dramaturgy and then trust the person on the end of the line to hold it together when they slip. He said the name of a man who was not Stephen and not Darren, a man with a first name that had become a brand of rooftop solar panels, and Moffat, listening on an earpiece in a car that smelled of receipts, mouthed thank you at a windscreen that did not require gratitude. Danny said he had a son who liked to count buses and that the boy would count better if he had a father who came home with the same number of bones he had left with. Nathan said that men built rooms and some of those rooms could be stepped out of if you picked your day, and Danny made a noise like agreement from a great distance.

After that, the week turned like a card in a magician’s hand, half on purpose and half because someone was watching for the turn. The yard under the viaduct had men in it who were not expecting visitors and then found themselves accompanied by people who could say warrant and mean it, and three vans discovered they were being measured properly for the first time in their lives. A name on a clipboard did not match a name on a ferry manifest and the mistake had the decency to be legible, and Moffat stood very still while other people did the necessary shouting because she had never found shouting useful as a way to move a day. There would be lawyers; there would be baroque explanations; there would be a man who claimed he had been scammed by a nephew who had a face like a primary school; but before any of that there would be a photo of a hubcap and a grain of gravel from a road on the wrong side of Folkestone, and a judge who had once been young would remember the precise way a wheel sings when it is telling you a story you should not ignore.

Nathan, whose job in this was to be available and to not allow his skin to begin to imitate a drum, went to a school where children were being taught that knees could bend without betraying you. He did not tell them about vans or squares or the ways a person’s life can begin to look too patterned for comfort; he told them about two steps and a turn and the way gravity, when not made personal, is simply honest. A small boy who had practised scorn said dancing was for women and Nathan showed him how to stand on the balls of his feet and feel clever, and the boy did and then was obliged to conceal a smile from his mates as if hiding treasure. On his way out of the hall he passed a noticeboard on which someone had pinned a photocopy that read FLOOR IS A TRUST, and he put his thumb on the corner as if to keep it from falling. A teacher with hair like a hedgehog asked if he would sign a permission slip for fate, and he promised to get back to her with a biro.

Mara called at an hour designed to suggest she was not the sort of woman who called at odd hours and asked whether the advert people had frightened him with numbers yet. He told her a figure and she said softly that she was going to stop asking men in the second half of their lives to tell her they found things unbelievable; the world had provided sufficient proof of its stupidity to make belief a practical posture. She said she would be at the taping on Saturday with a dress that had an opinion on women’s rights in a century that still wanted to ask permission, and that if he felt at any point that the men with coats were drifting over him like weather, she would invite them to sit with her and ask them questions about their mothers. He said that he had seen her disembowel a politician with her eyebrows and he trusted her to do triage. She said a thing about mortification that made him wheeze, and they both paused to admire the way complicated jokes fit into small spaces when two people have built the room together.

By Friday evening, squares had stopped appearing as frequently as if the chalk had got wet or the men who drew them were developing boredom, which is the closest thing to a weakness men like that allow themselves. The wax circle with the dot did not repeat itself, and Moffat allowed herself to suspect a teenager or a journalist with a new theory, which in some cities are indistinguishable. Nathan took the evening off from being useful in any visible way and went to a pub with chairs that had nursed four generations of elbows into a familial shape, and drank a pint at a speed that would not upset a Methodist. Kian joined him and told him a story about a tourist who had asked whether they sold gluten-free mince pies and had then eaten three after being told no, and they both performed the act of being people in a pub not talking about the thing they had promised not to talk about, which is an ancient masculine rite.

Saturday came with the smell of foil and hair spray and the peculiar clean anxiety of a floor that remembers choreography better than the men on it. The audience that had voted last week and gotten the name the nation wanted—by which everyone meant the producers—was back to do it again without remembering their own complicity in democracy, and Nathan, who had made his peace with democracy by kicking its shins and then kissing it, put his hands on the side of his head and breathed until his shoulders remembered to be ordinary. Lina drilled him in a way that would have made a cavalry officer blush, then lost her temper at a shoelace and swore with an elegance he envied daily. He caught sight of the coats in the back of the room and felt nothing that he could not convert into oxygen, which was either maturity or shock.

It happened in the second dance, the small thing that would later be written up as if it had been an engine of fate when in fact it was simply life doing its impartial physics. As they came out of a pivot that had the politeness to look harder than it was, his ankle sent a small postcard up his leg, a message in an old code, and he acknowledged it without sending an answer back. He altered the weight of a foot the way a mother shifts a baby on her hip when the bus lurches, and the change made Lina throw him a look that was mostly admiration and a bit of fury because she liked to know the choreography before the music did. They finished smoother than they had any right to, and in the wings she hissed at him that if he was lying to her she would install him in a chair and make him tell the truth until the cleaners came. He said later the way men in love say later when they mean both not now and not never, and she kissed his face in a place where the camera had no permission to be.

During the interval, when the building is most itself and everyone behaves as if television is something even children understand naturally, a runner brought Nathan a small white envelope with his name on it in the handwriting of a hospital receptionist. He opened it because pretending not to would have been an insult to his own curiosity, and inside was not a square but a photograph of a square drawn on a lino floor that could have been his gran’s or any woman’s in the seventies. In the middle of that square someone had placed two coins and a button, like a constellation done at kitchen scale, with the caption in biro: This is what we do instead of hurting people. He showed it to Moffat, who had smuggled herself into a gap between a lighting stand and a man who preferred lists to love, and she nodded once in a way that said both Noted and Try again when you’re cleverer.

Mara’s interview felt like a lullaby with teeth, gentle in the way the sea is only when it knows where the rocks are and has decided to be kind for ten minutes. She asked him if he had decided to be a man who looks at the lens and tells the truth with his lips or a man who pretends he is walking through a room with a friend, and he told her the middle distance was his church and she rolled her eyes in a manner that made three grandmothers fall in love with her at home. She asked him about heroes and he said his mother made sandwiches like a general and someone in the control room wept at their workstation and would deny it until their death. When the judges said their last nonsense for the night and the confetti committed its ritual crimes, he and Lina stood with their arms around each other and let the black of the cameras be the sky above them without asking it for anything it could not give.

After, in the corridor where rooms are stripped of glamour with the efficiency of stagehands who know how to fold miracles, Mal with the pastry-chef soul walked past carrying two buckets and a piece of advice for a young man who had tried to pick up a truss with his lower back. Nathan leaned his head back against a wall that had learned a thousand secrets and kept none, and Moffat came to stand next to him like a person waiting for the correct bus. She said the yard was shut, the ferry crossing had become a case file with its own number, the man with the rooftop solar panels had a solicitor who disapproved of violence but enjoyed money, and Danny had gone home to a child who counted buses until he slept. He asked her whether there would be a trial, whether men would go to prison for trying to make a dance into an accountancy, and she said softly that justice is a room with uncomfortable chairs and that some nights it is enough to have taken away a person’s capacity to believe themselves inevitable.

On the way back to the blue door they did the thing family always do after danger has been contained in folders with coloured tabs and the adrenaline has finished performing its opera. They argued about cake, about driving speeds, about whether you can hear foxes thinking when they shout at night, about whether Gideon had been handsome or simply nice in a way that made the camera forgive him. Nathan sent a text to a number he had been given that belonged to a reporter and said, calmly, that he was not ready to be anyone’s scandal, and that if she wanted a story she would do better to wait for a trial and write about quiet people at desks who read wheels for a living. She wrote back with a thumbs-up emoji and a sentence that made him want to buy her breakfast: Not everything has to be content; sometimes it is just a life.

At home the house held them the way good houses do, making a noise under their feet that reminded them it was older than all of this and would outlast all of it if they kept feeding the boiler. On the mat was a postcard from a dance shop in Cardiff advertising shoes no sane person could afford and the handwritten addition, in an old-fashioned, careful hand that could have belonged to either a grandmother or a patient criminal: Remember to turn on purpose. He put it on the mantel next to the charity-shop photograph of the laughing kitchen and the sugar bowl that could not decide what era it belonged to. The cat reclaimed the armchair like a soldier taking a hill and fell asleep with his chin on the arm, making a noise like someone sanding hope smooth and then lighting it.

Sunday tasted like bacon and old sunlight, and Bath performed its quiet play about being grateful for stone and not telling anyone. Nathan walked to the Abbey and watched a boy on a scooter refuse to be afraid of his own ankles, and he thought how much of living comes down to deciding which rooms are yours, and which rooms you will allow others to think they invented. He said his grandmother’s name to no one and felt the room expand enough for another breath. On the way home he noticed a new square chalked low, very neat, outside the optician’s, and below it someone had written, in a different hand and a sillier mood, No. He did not take a photograph of that one because it did not belong to the work; it belonged to the city, which had its own opinions on geometry.

On Monday the advert shoot unfolded like a recipe where the cook had decided to trust instinct, and nothing set fire to anything except one man’s dignity when a wind machine made a liar of his hair. They put him on the fake bus stop and told him to think about a kettle, and he did, and it made him unthreatening in the precise way brands want men to be. Lina drifted in and out of shot with her bag like a planet, and a small child in the park behind the set waved at the camera in a way that would make someone’s auntie in Scotland ring a landline at nine to say she had seen a ghost of her own youth. In the final set-up, the tiny words sat behind his shoulder inside the frame like a dare, and no one but three people knew they were there. That was enough, he decided, for a Monday in a city with an unending appetite for other people’s faces.

Moffat rang that evening to tell him that papers he would never read would have his name on them, that his testimony was unnecessary and therefore precious, that the men who thought windows were for climbing through had met a kind of glass they had not practised on. She told him not to be a martyr, not to become a campaign, not to imagine that living was less radical than going on the radio with a righteous tone. He said he would dance a foxtrot to annoy the men who wanted him to move like an accountant, and she said if he insisted on being poetic she would come round and make him write bullet points on his fridge. They rang off without saying goodbye because some conversations end like a waltz and others like a drill.

There were still squares, because men do not give up habits the instant they are asked to, and some of them had dots and some of them did not, and one of them had a small cat’s paw in the corner as if the universe had decided to become collaborative. Nathan, who had trained himself against superstition and had therefore acquired a useful collection of minor ones, began touching the top left corner of doorframes again as he passed them the way he had at nineteen before a patrol. He told no one, because a man is entitled to one or two private acts of nonsense as long as they do not injure others. He went to the studio above the carpet warehouse and swept the floor until it shone like someone’s hope, and he put the old book with diagrams on the windowsill because it liked the light and he liked the way its certainty made his doubts look less clever than they thought they were.

When Felton finally cornered him near the fire exit and tried to ask a question that had more oil than sincerity on it, Nathan smiled like a man who knew where every screw in the risers lived and had counted them twice. He said that the world was full of men who wanted to be told what to do with other people’s bodies, and that he was not taking applications today. Felton did the puffed laugh of a colleague who believes he has been bantered with and wandered away to go and irritate a shoe, and Lina slid into the space he left and put a grape in Nathan’s mouth because she liked him compliant and fruit is cheaper than threats. They rehearsed until the light outside learned to live with being exhausted and then they stopped not because anything was perfect but because something had landed in the right place and would be bruised if they moved it again.

It occurred to him, as he locked the blue door and listened to the house exhale against his back, that patience was not an absence of action but a choreography all its own. He could make himself into a line that invited harm or a shape that confused it long enough for better people to do their work, and rather to his annoyance he discovered he would rather learn the latter. Upstairs, the cat decided the landing was a sufficient bed and arranged himself like punctuation. Downstairs, the record player waited with its small private instructions and a song on a cheap disc whose only job was to be kept honest by a needle. He put it on because he knew when to accept orders and because he had not yet run out of nights where two steps and a turn could be enough to call a day finished properly.
