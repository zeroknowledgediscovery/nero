Whispers of the Wandering Wood
Chapter One: The Glimmer in the Bramble

The Bramblewood was older than the bones of the mountains that loomed behind it. Its trees gnarled and twisted like the thoughts of dreaming gods, their roots threading deep into a soil thick with stories never told aloud. Sunlight never dared to fully pierce the canopy, instead spilling through in fractured beams, soft as sighs. The forest breathed. It remembered.

And somewhere in its forgotten folds, a pixie named Nettle spun magic like a spider weaves silk.

She was not large, even by pixie standards, no taller than a sprig of lavender in bloom. Her wings, veined like frost on a windowpane, shimmered with colors that changed depending on the hour — at dawn, pink; at dusk, a bruised violet. Nettle’s eyes were too large for her face, giving her an expression that seemed forever on the edge of knowing too much. Her hair, a wind-tangled riot of moss and black curls, always smelled faintly of flint and rain.

Most pixies were capable of a trick or two — a glimmer to mislead, a whisper to misplace a hunter’s path. But Nettle? Nettle once turned a falling star into a lantern, just to light the inside of her tree-stump cottage for tea. Magic loved her, clung to her, circled her like moths to a flame that never burned. She was, as the older fae whispered behind the leaves, touched.

And as with all touched things, she was a little... odd.

Nettle’s cottage was hidden in the heart of a hollow oak. The door, a slab of beetle-polished bark, opened to a cozy room lined with shelves that hummed. Not metaphorically — they hummed, the spellbooks too saturated with old enchantments to stay quiet. The walls were covered in a hundred clocks, none of which told the right time but all of which chimed in peculiar unison when the mood struck them. Potions bubbled of their own accord, and the fireplace roared when someone told a particularly scandalous secret.

On this particular morning, which may or may not have been a Tuesday, Nettle stood before her cauldron and frowned.

“Too much ashroot,” she muttered. “Or not enough lieberry. Depends on whether I want it to fly or explode.”

“Perhaps both?” a voice offered helpfully.

Nettle turned to see a raven — or something dressed like one — perched on her window ledge. It wore a hat, which was the first clue that it wasn’t entirely of the bird persuasion.

“Grack,” she said. “You again.”

“Don’t sound so delighted. I brought news.” The raven-creature preened its feathers, which were in fact smoke made solid.

Nettle’s brow arched. “What kind of news?”

“The kind that crawls through roots and shivers through leaves. Something is stirring in the deepwood. Something old.”

She paused, stirring her potion counterclockwise, then clockwise again, then backwards in time. “Old things stir all the time. The Deepwood’s practically a retirement home for ancient evils.”

“Not like this,” Grack replied. “This one’s waking up with purpose.”

There was a long silence. The potion thickened. A single bubble rose, popped, and from it escaped a tiny sound like a trumpet playing a dirge.

Finally, Nettle sighed. “Fine. I’ll have a look.”

The journey to the Deepwood’s heart was not one taken lightly. Even for those born of magic, it was a place where reality folded like paper and secrets took shape in the fog. Nettle packed carefully: a pouch of truths (distilled, not fermented), a bottle of moonlight, a dagger carved from regret, and a biscuit.

The biscuit was for morale.

She flew low, darting between roots and hollows, careful not to disturb the sleeping stones. The deeper she went, the quieter the world became, as though even sound was wary of trespassing.

Then she heard it — not a noise exactly, but the absence of noise. A silence so absolute it had weight.

And in that silence stood a tree.

It was black. Not charred, not dark — black, like the color had been siphoned from every other thing and poured into this shape. It pulsed faintly, as though breathing. At its base, half-swallowed by moss, was a door. Not bark, not wood — stone, old and carved with sigils that curled and shifted when she tried to read them.

“Grack,” she whispered.

He was already beside her. “Told you.”

“This tree shouldn’t be here.”

“It wasn’t. Until it was.”

Nettle circled the door warily. “Do you think it’s a prison?”

Grack didn’t answer immediately. “If it is, something’s already loose.”

Back in the village of Thistledown Hollow, gossip fluttered like moths in the twilight. The elder pixies had noticed the signs: mushrooms blooming upside down, rivers running in loops, shadows refusing to match their owners. And all of it pointed to one conclusion — the Seal was weakening.

The Seal, according to fae lore, was forged in the First Silence — a time before song, before magic. It kept Hollowroot asleep.

And Hollowroot, in turn, had teeth.

Nettle returned home shaken. Not afraid, exactly. She didn’t really do fear the same way others did. But the air tasted different. Things long dead were whispering again.

The next day, she received a visitor.

He arrived on the back of a dragonfly the size of a sheep, wearing robes that sparkled like dew on a spiderweb. His name was Finloe, and he was from the Crystal Archive — a place where magic was studied, classified, and occasionally argued with.

“I’ve heard about your talents,” he said without preamble. “We need your help.”

Nettle gave him tea. “Flattery tastes better with honey. What do you want?”

“There’s a disturbance in the ley-lines. Something big. Your name keeps showing up in the readings.”

“Sounds like your problem.”

Finloe leaned forward. “It will be everyone’s problem if this breaks through. We believe it’s looking for a vessel. A source. A... host.”

“Then it’s foolish,” Nettle replied, sipping. “The woods will eat it.”

Finloe didn’t blink. “Or it will eat the woods.”

That night, Nettle stood on her roof and stared at the stars. They seemed farther away than usual. Her fingers itched with power — not her own, but something older. Something reaching.

She whispered a word she hadn’t spoken in centuries. The ground responded.

And far below the roots and rock, the thing in the tree stirred.

It had remembered her name.

Nettle didn’t sleep that night.

Sleep, for a pixie of her nature, was never just rest — it was wandering through dreamthreads spun by the Forestmind itself, tangling into visions of possible futures and impossible pasts. But that night, every time she tried to drift, she found herself falling into a great black root that spiraled down and down with no end. Faces peered out of the bark, eyes like melted gold, mouths whispering secrets too old to belong to this world. She would jerk awake each time just as the root split open like a mouth to swallow her whole.

So instead, she paced.

The floorboards creaked not from age, but from mild irritation. They didn’t like being walked on in circles, and she could hear them muttering under their breath. Even her cauldron had gone quiet, its usual happy burbling reduced to a low simmer, as if it too sensed something coiled in the dark.

When the first rays of dawn smudged the horizon like charcoal across damp paper, Nettle stopped in front of her window and opened the shutters. The air outside had changed again. Everything was too still. Even the breeze seemed to be holding its breath.

A knock came at her door, light but deliberate. Three taps, a pause, then two more. She frowned. That was the rhythm of the Old Compact, a call-and-response from the first treaties between the fae and the deeper wilds.

She opened it.

A figure stood on her threshold. Not tall, not short — it was the kind of shape your eyes forgot the moment you looked away. It wore a robe stitched from shadow and fog, its face hidden beneath a hood that seemed to drink the light around it. But Nettle knew who — or rather what — it was.

“The Hollowbound,” she murmured, narrowing her eyes. “You're not meant to leave the Rootstone.”

The creature tilted its head. “Neither are you.”

“I never swore an oath.”

“You were born under the First Tree’s shadow. That is oath enough.”

Nettle didn’t invite it in. That would have been unwise. Instead, she stepped out onto the moss-carpeted path and pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders. “Why are you here?”

“The bindings are fraying,” the Hollowbound said in a voice like wind through dead leaves. “Something is calling from the other side. Something that remembers the taste of stars and the songs of fire. We came to warn you.”

“I already saw the black tree.”

“It is not a tree. It is a seed.”

Nettle felt her stomach tighten. “What does it want?”

“Not what. Who.”

They stared at one another for a long moment. Behind her, inside her cottage, the humming from her books began to rise, uneasy and discordant.

“Why me?” she asked at last, though a part of her already knew.

“Because you are the only one foolish enough to touch what should remain untouched. And strong enough to survive it.”

With that, the Hollowbound turned and vanished, melting into the morning mist like ink into water.

By midday, the glade behind her cottage had grown cold despite the sunlight. Nettle stood ankle-deep in spell circles etched into the earth, each carved with precision and sealed with drops of her own blood. Around her floated relics she hadn’t touched in decades — an obsidian comb from the Dusk Court, a bone flute given by a dream-eater, a ring that once belonged to her sister before she’d vanished into the mirror realm. All anchors. All dangerous.

She was preparing for something she didn’t yet understand, but her instincts — older than her bones, older than her name — told her it was necessary.

The air vibrated.

A tear opened above the sigils. Not torn fabric, not light — more like the concept of place had been briefly removed from that spot. Through it, she glimpsed teeth. Not sharp. Wide. Endless. A smile without joy. A mouth without a face.

She flung a ward, then another, then a third — the tear sealed like a wound being pinched shut. The wind fell still again.

“Too soon,” she whispered, wiping sweat from her brow. “It’s trying to push through cracks.”

Behind her, Grack landed with a rustle of wing and smoke.

“You’re poking holes in the world again,” he said, eyeing the scorch mark where the tear had been.

“It poked first.”

“Semantics.” He hopped closer, pecked at a root. “You need help.”

“I have you.”

“I mean real help. This thing isn’t just hungry. It’s curious. That’s worse.”

Nettle knelt, began packing away the relics. “I’ll go to the Weaver.”

Grack fluffed his wings. “She’s not going to be pleased.”

“She never is.”

The Weaver lived where the world thinned to thread.

At the edge of the Barrowveil, where mist wept from the trees and the grass grew in spirals, Nettle found the ancient spider-fae hunched over her loom. Her body was long and low, more silk than flesh, her eight limbs moving in rhythmic precision as she spun strands of time and story into cloth that shimmered with unreal colors.

“Still wearing that awful shawl?” the Weaver said without looking up.

“Still weaving stories no one believes?” Nettle retorted.

They grinned at each other, or at least Nettle did. The Weaver’s expression was harder to read.

“You’ve felt it then,” the Weaver said after a pause. “The stirring.”

“I’ve seen more than felt. It’s not hiding anymore.”

The Weaver cut the thread she’d been working on with a blade made of stillborn lightning and gestured for Nettle to sit. “It’s not a return. It’s a reckoning. What was buried wasn’t dead. Just dreaming.”

Nettle sat on a cushion woven from moss and old songs. “It’s looking for me.”

“No,” the Weaver said, tilting her head. “It’s looking for itself. You’re just... close.”

“Close how?”

“You carry too many old things inside you, Nettle. Memories that aren’t yours. Echoes of oaths you never swore. It wants to wear you like a coat.”

Nettle went cold. “How do I stop it?”

The Weaver reached beneath her loom, pulled out a bundle wrapped in twilight. “You don’t. But you can trick it. If you’re clever. And if you’re willing to lie.”

“To it?”

“To yourself.”

Back at her cottage, Nettle stood in front of her mirror.

The bundle from the Weaver was a charm. Not a weapon, not a shield — a knot of possibility, anchored in a future that might never come to pass. It hummed in her hands.

Her reflection blinked.

She did not.

Nettle stepped forward. The reflection didn’t move. It stared back at her, its eyes black as hollows.

“Found you,” it said.

And then the glass exploded.

The shards rained down like frozen raindrops, glittering midair before clattering to the floor in a discordant chorus of breaking spells and unraveling wards. Nettle threw up a hand, and the air thickened around her — not quite a barrier, more a thrum of resistance, like pushing against heavy fog. The largest pieces of the mirror stilled in place, hovering with malevolent intention, and in their jagged reflections she saw dozens of versions of herself, each expression different — some horrified, others blank, and one smiling far too wide.

She spoke a word then, one she had not uttered since the last Thorn War, a word so old it had no true vowels, only breath and intent. The air snapped tight. The mirror shards dissolved into powder, then into nothing, sucked into the weave of the walls, leaving behind only silence and the faint scent of rosemary and rust.

But the voice remained.

It slithered in behind her, from no mouth and all mouths at once. “You are thin,” it murmured. “A vessel too small. But clever. Clever vessels grow deeper.”

Nettle clenched her fists and turned, but there was nothing there. No shadow, no shape — just the whisper, now fading into the grain of the wood, the fibers of her books, the quiet tremble of magic hiding in corners. She exhaled slowly. This was no longer a stirring. This was intrusion.

Grack sat perched on a windowsill, his wings folded tight, watching with unusual solemnity.

“It’s inside,” she said, voice flat.

“It’s... brushing,” Grack replied. “Like a hand on a curtain, testing the weave. If you let it tug again, it’ll start to come through.”

Nettle moved slowly to the hearth and lit the flame with a twist of her fingers. Blue fire burst forth, casting long shadows that flickered like dancers caught mid-motion. She placed the Weaver’s charm into the flame and whispered a second word — this one not old, but forbidden. The charm pulsed, then cracked open like a seed.

From inside bloomed a sphere of light, no larger than a plum. It floated upward and hovered in the center of the room, spinning slowly. From it projected a lattice of runes that turned in and on themselves, looping like serpent knots.

“What’s that supposed to do?” Grack asked, his voice tight.

Nettle didn’t answer. She was listening. Her eyes followed the patterns in the lattice, tracking their shifting syntax, watching for the break. It came — not in the pattern, but in the reflection it cast against the far wall.

One symbol glowed dark instead of light.

“There,” she breathed. “That’s where it’s pressing.”

The runes snapped together into a single glyph — a door. Not physical, not present. Conceptual. The kind of door only opened from inside.

Nettle turned her back on it. “We’re not ready for that yet.”

“You will be,” said Grack. “Or you’ll be... something else.”

Three nights passed with no further events, though the quiet had changed its tone. Birds flew in strange patterns, avoiding areas of the sky. Bees hummed songs in minor keys. Even the wind carried messages now — not words, exactly, but feelings, sharp and bitter like regret.

On the fourth morning, Nettle woke to find the village elder at her door.

Tansy Elderroot was the kind of pixie who could turn a stare into a weapon. She wore a cloak of ivy and thorn, and her eyes were the silver of moonlit dew. Once, long ago, she had commanded armies of whisper-moths and walked through fire without burning. Now she ruled Thistledown Hollow with a silence more powerful than law.

“May I come in?” Tansy asked.

Nettle stepped aside. “If you’re going to scold me, at least have tea first.”

Tansy took the offered cup without sitting. “Something old has slipped through. The mirror folk have fled. One of the hollow wells is singing.”

“I know,” Nettle said.

“You’ve been stirring things again.”

“I didn’t stir. I just looked. It saw me.”

Tansy’s lips tightened. “Then we must move quickly. The Eldergrove has called a moot. They want you there.”

“That’s a bad idea,” Nettle said without hesitation. “You know how they are. The last time I attended a moot, three willows set fire to themselves and a pine tried to eat my shoes.”

Tansy’s voice was iron wrapped in velvet. “This isn’t a request.”

Nettle exhaled, turned back to her cluttered workbench. “Fine. But if someone tries to bind me again, I’m setting the moss on fire.”

“Understood.”

The Eldergrove was a place few pixies visited lightly. Deep in the heart of the Bramblewood, past the Rootbone Caverns and the Pool of Whispers, it stood as a circle of living trees older than stories. Each was a sentinel of its own domain — Oak, Birch, Ash, Thorn, and Yew. Their bark bore runes in languages spoken only in sleep. Their roots stretched miles deep, interwoven in a lattice of magic that held the entire forest’s memory.

When Nettle arrived, the grove was already crowded.

There were fae of every variety — mosslings from the northern bogs, bark-skinned rootkin from the dry hills, a pair of glasswings from the coast who shimmered with ocean hues. Even a windwalker from the Upper Air had coiled down into a tethered form to attend.

They all fell silent as she stepped into the circle.

The Oak, who served as the mouth of the moot, spoke first.

“Nettle Fernwhistle, you are summoned under the Pact of Leaf and Star. Do you come willingly?”

“No,” she replied, “but I’m here anyway.”

A rustle passed through the grove — half disapproval, half amusement.

“You have awakened an ancient tether,” the Oak continued. “Something that was meant to sleep.”

“I didn’t wake it,” Nettle said. “It was waking already. I just happened to be close enough to notice.”

The Ash spoke then, its voice like crackling bark. “Proximity is not innocence.”

Nettle stepped forward. “Neither is inaction.”

Silence.

Then the Birch — youngest and most impulsive of the grove — leaned forward. “What is it, exactly?”

Nettle hesitated. “It’s not one thing. It’s many things. It’s... the memory of a god, maybe. The echo of what used to be worshipped, before names mattered. It’s hunting for a mind to wear. And it found me.”

The Yew, who had not spoken yet, finally stirred. Its voice was slow, heavy. “Will it succeed?”

“That’s what I came to find out,” Nettle said. “And why I came to ask for something dangerous.”

All the trees leaned inward.

“I need access to the Rootward Vault.”

The reaction was immediate. Shock. Fear. Rage.

The Thorn, sharpest of them all, hissed. “You dare request that?”

“I do,” Nettle replied. “Because it already knows me. If I don’t learn its name, it will take mine.”

The trees conferred in silence. It felt like hours.

Then the Oak turned back. “So be it. You may enter.”

Nettle bowed slightly, though her heart felt like it was crawling toward her throat. The Rootward Vault was sealed for a reason. Only those with permission from the entire moot could even find the entrance.

Now, she was going in. Alone.

As she turned to leave, Grack flapped down beside her, silent.

“You coming?” she asked.

“I don’t think I have a choice anymore.”

“Neither do I.”

Chapter Two: The Vault Beneath the Roots

The entrance to the Rootward Vault was not marked by stone or spell, but by stillness. The path leading to it lay beneath the oldest tree in the Eldergrove — a colossal behemoth of bark and shadow known only as the Deepmother. Her trunk bore no carvings, no glyphs, only the natural folds and fissures that resembled sleeping faces. When Nettle placed her hand against it, the bark opened like a sigh.

She stepped inside.

The air changed immediately, thickening with ancient breath. Inside the trunk was a spiral staircase of roots — not grown but shaped, as though the tree had dreamed them into this form for the sake of those who would descend. The way down was lit by fungus that glowed a color Nettle couldn’t name, neither green nor gold nor blue. It pulsed slowly, like a heartbeat. She could feel her magic growing taut, threads pulling toward something below, something vast.

Grack clung to her shoulder, unusually silent. His eyes were sharper here, more avian, less smoke. The deeper they went, the more he seemed to shift — less illusion, more essence. It reminded her of what he truly was, though she rarely let herself remember.

At the base of the staircase, the walls gave way to open space.

The Vault was a chamber without ceiling or floor, a place suspended between layers of memory. Roots crisscrossed the air like the ribs of a forgotten god, thick as towers and covered in runes that moved of their own accord. In the center of the chamber floated a prism — not crystalline, not material — a knot of compressed time and identity, bound in the language of creation.

The Vault was not a place. It was a consequence.

Nettle stepped into the void and didn’t fall. Her magic kept her balanced, light as breath. She drifted toward the prism, heart pounding in a way it hadn’t since she first glimpsed the black tree.

“What now?” Grack asked, voice hushed by awe or fear.

“I ask,” Nettle replied.

She extended her hand toward the prism and spoke a question — not aloud, but into the lattice of meaning itself.

What hunts me?

The prism shuddered. Lights flickered. The runes across the roots hissed and turned inward, focusing. Then the answer came, not in words, but a feeling, a vision—

A throne of teeth in a hall of mirrors. A crown made of forgotten prayers. Eyes without lids, watching from within every reflection. A hunger that remembered being worshipped. A being known in ancient times as Dreldein, the Hollow Crown.

Nettle reeled back, clutching her chest. The prism’s glow receded, shivering like water struck by a stone.

“Dreldein,” she whispered. “It was exiled by the Pact of the Vein. Buried in the Unwaking Root. The Seal was supposed to fracture its name.”

“It remembers more than it should,” Grack said grimly.

“It’s rebuilding itself. Through dreams. Through mirrors. Through me.”

She reached again for the prism. “How do I sever the tether?”

The answer was slower this time. Images flickered and danced: a blade carved from self-denial, a mirror turned outward, the blood of kin willingly given. A choice.

“It needs a host,” she said. “But it also needs a story. A myth to inhabit. That’s how it survives.”

“So,” said Grack, voice dry, “we kill the story?”

“No,” Nettle said, eyes sharp now. “We rewrite it.”

Returning from the Vault left her drained in ways she didn’t fully understand. The walk back to her cottage felt long and warped, as if the woods shifted with each step, reluctant to let her leave. The Eldergrove was quiet. Even Tansy had not waited for her. Word would spread, of course. The Vault did not open without echo.

Back in her home, Nettle lit every lamp and hung wards across every window. Her shelves rattled with restless books. Her cauldron refused to boil, sulking in its hearth. She didn’t blame it. The room itself felt like it was holding its breath, bracing for something inevitable.

She sat at her desk and opened the Weaver’s scroll — a blank strip of barkskin inked in disappearing script. Slowly, she began to write her counterspell. Not a banishment — that wouldn’t hold Dreldein. No, she would craft a narrative, something to override the god’s own self-image. She needed to trap it in a tale more compelling than the one it had been telling itself for eons.

Grack watched her from the mantle. “You’re going to make it believe a lie?”

“No,” Nettle replied. “I’m going to make it live a different truth.”

“And what truth is that?”

Nettle hesitated, then wrote one sentence at the top of the scroll: The monster was once a child who forgot its name.

Grack tilted his head. “That’s... surprisingly gentle.”

“I don’t believe in evil,” she said. “Only in things that hurt too long and forgot how to stop.”

The scroll glowed faintly. The story had accepted its seed.

But nothing remained quiet for long.

That night, as Nettle prepared her wards and sipped tea made from memory-blossom petals, the shadows in her cottage deepened. One by one, the lanterns went out. Not by draft. Not by will. They snuffed themselves, as though ashamed to cast light.

She stood, back to the hearth, listening.

No footsteps. No wind. No voice.

Only the mirror.

She had replaced the shattered one with silvered water in a frame of birch. It was a temporary ward, reflecting only what should be seen. But now, the water had gone still — not the stillness of calm, but of absence. Like it had forgotten how to ripple.

A face surfaced.

Not hers.

It looked like her — a shadow of her, if she had never laughed, never loved, never chosen curiosity over caution. A version grown in darkness and silence. The reflection smiled.

“You can’t rewrite me,” it said.

Nettle stepped closer. “Can’t I?”

The mirror rippled. “You are the lie. I am the truth of you. The truth beneath.”

“No,” she whispered. “You’re what was left behind when I became myself.”

The face snarled. The mirror cracked — not broken, but split like bark under pressure.

Dreldein was pushing again.

She grasped the scroll and pressed her hand to its center, pouring the story into the room. The glow spread, spiderwebbing along the walls, touching every book, every floorboard. A pulse radiated outward — not magic, but narrative. A version of the world that would not include Dreldein’s version.

The shadow screamed.

And then it was gone.

Only the soft bubbling of the cauldron returned, tentative, like an apology.

Nettle sat down slowly.

“That wasn’t even the full thing,” she muttered.

“No,” Grack said, hopping down beside her. “That was the breath before the scream.”

At dawn, someone knocked on her door again.

This time, it was not a fae or a forest-creature, but a human — a boy, no older than twelve, eyes hollow, voice quiet.

“I dreamed about you,” he said.

Nettle blinked. “You’re a long way from any village.”

“They said I had to find the spark-witch,” the boy replied. “They said you could show me how to wake up.”

Nettle looked past him, at the rising sun. The wind stirred the leaves, carrying with it the scent of iron and honey.

“Come in,” she said.

And as he stepped through, the story began to grow.

The boy's name was Thomlin. He had hair like harvested straw and eyes that had seen too much for someone who still tripped over his own boots. His voice was soft-spoken, but not shy — more like he’d learned to speak in tones that wouldn’t draw attention, the way hunted things do. Nettle offered him bread with honey, and though he ate slowly, it was clear he hadn’t had something warm in days.

He told her his dreams between mouthfuls, his words careful, as if speaking too plainly might make them too real.

“I see this place. Dark and wet. Everything echoes, like it’s deep inside a tree or under a hill. There’s a... humming, like bees trapped in my chest. And then the voice comes. Not loud. But right there.” He tapped his temple. “It says things that I know aren’t mine. Words I never learned.”

“What kinds of words?” Nettle asked, already knowing the answer.

“Old ones. Names that make my ears feel cold. It says I belong to the Hollow Crown. That I was promised before I was even born.”

Nettle’s lips pressed into a line. “You were born during a Silence Year, weren’t you?”

Thomlin nodded. “I never cried. That’s what they said. When I came out, the midwife said the air stopped moving in the room. That my eyes were already open.”

That clinched it. Silence Years were rare — gaps in the pulse of the world, when the Leylines ran quiet and time seemed to fold slightly at the corners. Children born during those years often carried strange tethers, half-born ties to things forgotten.

Nettle stood and began rifling through her shelves, pulling down old records bound in hair and sealed with wax. She didn’t bother asking Thomlin where he’d come from. If the Hollow Crown had truly touched him, distance was irrelevant.

“What happens when you sleep?” she asked.

“I wake up wrong,” he whispered. “Sometimes I’m not in my body when I open my eyes. I can feel him looking out through me. Talking in my voice.”

Grack landed beside him and peered into the boy’s face with one beady eye. “He’s marked,” the raven murmured. “But not fully rooted. You could still cut the tether.”

“Cutting won’t be enough,” Nettle muttered as she flipped through the scrolls. “Dreldein doesn’t just mark with intent. He leaves pieces behind. Hooks. Stories.”

She found the page she was looking for — a ritual from the Thorn Manuscripts. Not a banishment, not a sealing. A rewriting. The same method she had begun using on herself.

She laid the scroll across the table and lit the corner with starlight.

“Thomlin, I need you to listen to me very carefully.”

The boy nodded, all traces of weariness burned off by the intensity in her tone.

“We’re going to tell a different story about you. One that Dreldein can’t live inside. It’ll be hard. It might hurt. But when we’re done, he won’t be able to find you again.”

Thomlin’s fingers curled around the edge of the table. “What if I forget who I am?”

“You won’t,” she said. “You’ll remember who you chose to be. That’s stronger than any memory he gave you.”

The ritual began at sundown.

She had cleared a space behind her cottage, circling the clearing with ash from her own hearth, blood from her fingertip, and the last breath of a summer wind caught in a glass jar. Thomlin stood barefoot in the center, wearing a simple tunic. In his hands, he held three things: a feather, a broken tooth, and a blackened acorn. Each was a symbol of something Dreldein had touched — air, flesh, seed — and each would be rewritten.

Grack perched on a low branch, silent for once.

Nettle stood opposite the boy and raised the scroll.

“In the name of thread and thorn,” she intoned, “in the name of all names unspoken, I cast the tale anew.”

The scroll burned, but the words hung in the air, glowing symbols dancing between them. One by one, she began to speak them aloud, binding each to Thomlin’s breath, his pulse, his shadow.

“You are not the silence born, but the echo breaker.

“You are not a hollow seed, but a wild root.

“You are not the mouth of Dreldein, but the end of his whisper.”

As the words took shape, Thomlin’s eyes rolled back. The clearing shuddered. The ground groaned.

And then — laughter.

Not from the boy. Not from Nettle.

From the trees.

The laughter echoed through bark and branch, cold and amused.

“So small,” said a voice from the roots themselves. “You think a child’s tale can unmake me?”

The clearing darkened, the light from Nettle’s wards dimming.

A shape stepped from the trees. Not a body, not truly. It wore a robe of writhing vines and a crown of thorns that bled darkness. Its face was a mask of many — sometimes a child’s, sometimes hers, sometimes something far older.

Grack leapt from the tree, wings spread wide. “Too soon!” he cried. “You pulled him through too soon!”

Nettle stood her ground, the words still hovering around her. “He followed the tether. Thomlin is the anchor.”

Dreldein tilted its head. “He was always mine. I planted him in the world and waited. You think rewriting changes the root?”

“I don’t need to change it,” Nettle said. “Just burn it.”

She snapped her fingers.

The scroll’s remaining words ignited. The symbols twisted, reversed, reshaped. A glyph formed — the same one she’d seen in the Vault, only inverted. A sigil of identity unbinding.

Dreldein screamed. The sound tore through the clearing like broken glass.

Thomlin collapsed to his knees. The feather turned to flame. The tooth dissolved into salt. The acorn crumbled to dust. One by one, the bindings unraveled.

Nettle stepped forward, her magic laced with fire and blood.

“This is my story,” she said. “You’re just a footnote.”

And she thrust her hand into the shadow’s chest.

There was no resistance — only a howl, and then smoke, thick and cloying, burst outward from the shape. Dreldein fractured, his form collapsing like a puppet cut from its strings. The dark scattered, flailing toward the corners of the world.

And then there was silence.

Real silence.

The ritual had worked.

Thomlin lay on the ground, breathing hard, tears streaking down his face. Nettle knelt beside him, brushing hair from his forehead. His skin felt warmer. Softer. Like it had finally remembered what being alive meant.

“Is it gone?” he whispered.

“For now,” Nettle said. “But stories like that never die. They hide. They change shape. You’ll need to be careful.”

He nodded. “So will you.”

That night, after Thomlin was asleep in her guest hammock and the wards had been redrawn with stronger lines, Nettle sat at her desk and wrote a new page.

She titled it The Dream That Forgot Its Dreamer.

It wasn’t a spell. Not exactly.

It was a warning.

And a beginning.

Because the tether wasn’t just to Thomlin. It had been testing others, too. The dream-roots stretched across the ley, touching other Silence-born, other cracks in the world’s rhythm. Dreldein’s reach was deeper than she’d feared.

Grack, reading over her shoulder, gave a low whistle.

“How many others do you think are touched?”

“Too many,” Nettle replied. “And most don’t even know.”

She folded the page and sealed it with wax shaped like a spiral — the symbol of memory reclaiming itself.

“It’s time we found them,” she said.

“You mean... start a war?”

She shook her head. “Start a story. One strong enough to hold them together.”

And outside, somewhere beyond the trees, something listened.

Not Dreldein.

Something older.

And it was curious.

Chapter Three: Threads Beyond the Hollow

The message was carried by a dream moth, its wings translucent and trailing particles of sleep. It arrived at Nettle’s window just after dusk three nights after the ritual, spiraling through the hazy twilight with the drunken grace of something more idea than creature. When it landed on the sill, it folded itself into a curl and disintegrated into letters of glowing ink. Nettle read the missive once, then a second time, her frown deepening.

“They found another one,” she muttered.

Grack, roosting upside down from the rafters, twisted his head toward her. “Another Silence-born?”

“Worse. This one is dream-flooded.” She pressed her palm flat to the wooden sill, letting the message seep into the grain of her cottage. “It’s spreading faster than we thought.”

Grack straightened, wings flaring. “Where?”

“Far edge of the Drowning Fen. Near the Lornspire.”

He let out a breath through his beak. “That’s old land. Dead land. Nothing sane lives there.”

“Nothing sane,” she agreed. “But something lives.”

Nettle stood, already reaching for her travel kit. She packed it methodically: truththorn for cutting lies, a silver spool of tether-thread, three potions in clouded glass, and her wand — crooked, burnt at the tip, and still humming with the aftershock of her last duel. The wand she hadn’t used in decades, not since the Winter Binding.

“Will the boy be safe?” Grack asked.

“Thomlin will be fine. Tansy’s watchers are already stationed nearby. And he has the glyph now. It’ll warn him.”

She paused, her hand hovering over a crystal vial filled with compressed dusk.

“Grack.”

He tilted his head.

“If I don’t come back in three nights, burn the scrolls. All of them. Don’t let what’s inside them find another way out.”

The raven’s eyes darkened. “Don’t talk like that.”

“I’m not planning to die. Just... hedging.”

The Drowning Fen earned its name honestly. It was a place where the land forgot it was supposed to stay solid. Mist clung to every surface, and the water beneath the grass was never more than an inch away, lurking like a predator. Paths shifted when unlooked at. Sounds traveled in loops. It was a place where things once buried tended to resurface.

Nettle touched down just before midnight.

Her wings were already slick with dew, her boots mud-caked. The air was thick with the scent of peat, salt, and something slightly metallic — like wet coins buried under rotting leaves. She pulled her shawl tighter, muttering a hex to keep her temperature steady. The chill here wasn’t natural. It gnawed.

The letter had given her coordinates in the old way: three paces west of the crying tree, past the mirror pool, until the ground sings. Nettle found the tree easily — its bark weeping sap that smelled like grief. The pool came next, reflecting nothing but sky even though clouds had long since swallowed the moon.

And then the ground began to hum.

She stopped.

Before her was a clearing, impossibly dry, and in its center stood a girl. Not quite child, not quite grown — suspended in that ageless state peculiar to beings touched by the fey or by fate. Her eyes glowed faintly. Her feet didn’t touch the ground.

Nettle felt her mouth go dry.

The girl turned, slowly, as if sensing a draft rather than sound. When she spoke, her voice echoed twice — once in the air, once in Nettle’s spine.

“You are the one who rewrites,” said the girl.

“I try,” Nettle replied carefully. “What’s your name?”

The girl blinked. “They called me Eline once. But now I have many names. Most of them not mine.”

“Are you awake?”

“Sometimes. But mostly... I dream. And in the dream, I am everyone. And everything.”

Nettle took a cautious step closer. “Someone touched you. Something.”

“Not someone,” Eline said. “Everyone. Every Silence-born. Every tether. I feel them. I am them. The dream passes through me like water through cloth. I catch the shape, but never the weight.”

This was worse than she feared. Eline wasn’t just marked. She was becoming a conduit.

“How long have you been here?”

“Time is unthreaded. But I remember the bees.”

Nettle nodded once. Then, slowly, she reached into her satchel and removed the tether-thread. “May I try something?”

Eline tilted her head. “If you break me, I will unravel.”

“I’m not here to break anything.”

Carefully, Nettle unraveled a length of the thread — it shimmered as it moved, catching traces of thought and sound. She circled Eline once, whispering binding words that didn’t bind, but define. The thread responded, drawing a shape from the girl’s floating form — an outline of selfhood, a border between what was hers and what was not.

Eline gasped.

“I remember the river,” she whispered. “I remember my mother’s song. I remember... me.”

The thread pulsed, anchoring.

But then, the ground screamed.

It wasn’t a sound — not in the normal way. It was pressure, emotional and real, forcing tears to Nettle’s eyes without permission. A pulse burst from the soil, hurling her backward into the mud. The mist around them snapped taut and peeled back, revealing eyes — dozens of them, blinking from trees, from puddles, from air itself.

Dreldein had found her again.

“Grack,” she hissed into the air, activating the whisper bond. “Get here. Now.”

The raven’s reply was distorted by distance. “Already on my way.”

Eline was hovering higher now, her glow flickering. Her voice rose, panicked.

“They’re inside again. The dream is cracking.”

Nettle stood, swaying, her hand pressed to her chest. Her wards were fraying. The spell was leaking. She had no choice.

“Eline. Listen. You have to come back into your body. Take hold. Choose.”

“I’m not strong enough!”

“Yes, you are. I’m not your story. You are.”

Eline screamed — and in that sound was everything: terror, defiance, mourning. Her light exploded outward. The eyes recoiled, melting. The mist shivered and collapsed. And then...

Silence.

Real, full, holy silence.

Eline crumpled to the earth, breathing hard, her eyes normal again.

Nettle knelt beside her. “You’re back.”

“I held the thread,” the girl whispered. “It was so small. But it was mine.”

Nettle smiled, exhausted. “That’s all it ever takes.”

Grack arrived ten minutes later, soaked and swearing.

“Did I miss the apocalypse again?”

“Barely,” Nettle said, helping Eline to her feet. “You’re late.”

“I brought snacks,” he offered, lifting a satchel that smelled strongly of burnt sugar.

They returned to the edge of the Fen by morning, traveling in silence for long stretches. Eline slept part of the way, head resting against Nettle’s shoulder, the thread tied like a bracelet around her wrist.

“You’ll need to teach her,” Grack murmured. “She’s more than a survivor.”

“I know,” Nettle replied. “She’s an amplifier. Every voice Dreldein touches, she echoes. But she can echo truth now. That matters.”

“And if Dreldein returns?”

Nettle glanced up at the stars, fading in the light.

“Then we teach every Silence-born how to write their own ending.”

The sun broke the edge of the horizon like a yolk in water, its light bleeding across the damp edge of the Fen, painting everything in orange and violet. The trees, warped and hunched from years of slow decay, cast long fingers of shadow that reached and curled over the mossy ground. Eline stirred under the crook of Nettle’s arm, her breath steady, no longer echoing. For the first time in days, her presence did not disturb the air around her. She was anchored now, at least for the moment.

They made their way slowly through the shallows of the bog, climbing the ridges where land forgot it was meant to be submerged. Nettle could feel the rhythm of the ley returning beneath her boots — sluggish, but not broken. Where Dreldein had touched, the threads of the world remained twisted, singed at the edges, but the damage was no longer growing.

The next hill came into view, one she recognized. At its base stood a monolith — ancient, etched with moss-eaten glyphs — a boundary marker from the elder days. It had once signaled a limit to the Old Kingdoms, a place where civilization dared not tread. Now it was a reminder that even history could drown if it wasn’t tied to something solid.

They paused beneath it.

Eline looked up at the stones. “What is that?”

“A warding post,” Nettle answered. “Before stories like Dreldein’s even began, the old ones carved the world with meaning. This is one of the last that still holds. Faint, but it resists him.”

“It doesn’t look like much,” Eline said, brushing her fingers along the moss.

“Neither do most things that matter,” Nettle replied, and for a moment, the three of them — the witch, the child, the half-formed raven — stood in silence beneath it, breathing in the space it offered.

A low tremor passed beneath their feet. Not a threat, not this time. Something stirring deeper, slower. The world adjusting its spine after a long, uneasy slumber.

“I think we’re being watched,” Grack muttered.

“I know we’re being watched,” Nettle said. “The Lornspire's too close for comfort.”

The Lornspire rose above the bog just two miles north — a spire of bone-white stone shaped like a spear hurled from the heavens. It had no doors, no visible seams, but the fae whispered it had once been a prison, or a tower, or perhaps a relic of a dead god’s finger. No one truly knew. All they agreed on was that it never changed position, yet always seemed to loom closer when you looked away.

“We’re not going there,” Grack warned.

“Not today,” Nettle agreed. “But soon. Dreldein left echoes behind. Not just in minds. In places.”

Eline had turned back toward the marker, her brow furrowed.

“There’s something in the stone,” she said.

“What do you mean?”

She stepped forward and pressed her ear to the glyphs. Her body stiffened. Her eyes widened. Her mouth opened — not in scream or warning, but in recitation.

A voice emerged, old and androgynous, neither hers nor Dreldein’s.

“When the roots forget the song of water, the hollow returns. When silence falls on the name of light, the mirror opens. When the crowned mouth speaks through dreaming wood, the weaver must choose: cut the thread, or be unspun.”

Then silence.

Eline slumped to her knees, panting.

Grack's feathers stood on end. “Well. That’s ominous.”

Nettle stepped forward, hands trembling slightly. She knelt beside Eline, checking her pulse, her breath, the clarity in her eyes.

“I think,” she said slowly, “we just heard part of the old prophecy. The one they buried after the Thorn Reckoning. The one the Eldergrove denied existed.”

Eline’s voice was hoarse. “It’s not a prophecy. It’s a warning. A choice.”

Nettle helped her to her feet. “They all are.”

By the time they returned to Thistledown Hollow, the sky had gone gray. Not with storm, but with the peculiar heaviness that signaled a thinning of the world’s border. Pixies in the treetops whispered of strange winds. The mushrooms glowed when they shouldn’t. The reflection-pools were still even when disturbed.

Tansy Elderroot met them at the gate.

She looked older than before — not in body, but in gaze. Like she’d seen something she couldn’t unsee. She said nothing at first, only looked at Eline, and then at Nettle.

“You brought it with you.”

“I brought her,” Nettle replied. “And yes, she touched it. But she’s not part of it. Not anymore.”

“Are you certain?”

“No. But certainty isn’t a luxury we get.”

Tansy nodded slowly. “There’s been movement. The waters near the Hollow Wells are sinking. Something is pulling the veins of the forest. We believe Dreldein left something behind in the Rootmirror.”

Nettle grimaced. “That well was sealed. With six glyphs.”

“They broke,” Tansy said simply.

Grack let out a low, pitiful groan. “Well, that’s... delightful.”

Nettle looked at Eline. “You’re going to stay here for now. Tansy will teach you the deeper wards. You’ll be safe. Or safer, at least.”

“I want to help,” Eline said. “I want to help find the others.”

“You will. But right now, you’re a spark. You need time before you become a flame.”

Eline nodded, though reluctantly. She understood, even if she didn’t like it.

Nettle turned to Tansy. “There’s more of them. Dozens. Maybe hundreds. And Dreldein was never the only voice in the dark. He was just the one that remembered how to sing.”

Tansy tilted her head. “You’re saying something worse is coming?”

“I’m saying something older is waking. The vault dream was only a symptom. The illness is spreading through memory. Through legacy.”

Tansy stepped aside. “Then I’ll ready the Hollow. You do what you do best.”

Nettle looked to the sky, where the sun had been, but no longer was.

“Rewrite the endings.”

That night, she didn’t sleep.

Instead, she sat at her desk, carving new runes into the wood. This time, she was not sealing. She was preparing. There was a difference.

Grack watched her, preening in awkward silence.

“You’re getting serious again,” he said. “I don’t like when you get serious.”

“I’m always serious,” she murmured.

“No, you’re always dangerous. There’s a difference.”

Nettle didn’t respond. She was too busy drawing the map — not of roads, but of dreams. The dreamlines stretched like veins across the parchment, pulsing faintly as she touched each node. Her magic hummed along the edges.

“There,” she whispered. “There’s where the next voice will rise.”

Grack leaned closer. “That’s the Icehollow. Nothing lives there anymore.”

“Exactly,” Nettle said. “Which makes it the perfect place for forgotten stories to grow.”

She marked it with a thorn-shaped sigil. Then another beside it — the Weaver’s spiral.

Then she picked up the thread bracelet Eline had given her and tied it around her wrist.

“Tomorrow,” she said. “We begin again.”

Outside, the forest held its breath.

And somewhere far away, under ice and silence, something opened its eyes.

Chapter Four: The Icehollow Silence

It took Nettle three days to reach the Icehollow.

The journey was more trial than travel — every mile marked by twisted geography and the aftermath of dreams gone wrong. She crossed forests that whispered in reversed tongues, glades where time pulsed too quickly or too slowly, and hills that bent inward, swallowing their own paths. The Hollow Crown’s touch lingered in the land, like a bruise that would not fade.

By the time the air grew sharp enough to bite skin, she knew she was close.

The Icehollow was a place even maps refused. A circular basin carved from ancient glacier-bone, it sat silent beneath the eaves of the Northwall Cliffs, hemmed in by frost and riddled with silence. It was always snowing there, even in the height of summer. But it was not a stormy snow. It fell evenly, gently, like ash.

And just beneath the surface of that snow, things stirred.

Nettle stopped at the edge and crouched, pressing her palm to the frost. Her magic flinched. The leyline here was not broken — it was dormant, as if something had settled over it like a blanket, dulling the pulse. She let her eyes flutter closed, listening.

Nothing.

No birds. No wind. No rustle of branch or footfall. The air did not echo. It absorbed.

She stood, adjusted her coat — a heavy wool garment stitched with whisper-wards and lined with red fox-fur — and stepped into the basin.

With every step, the snow swallowed sound. The weight of it didn’t press against her so much as follow, clinging to her boots, her shawl, her thoughts. By the time she reached the center, she wasn’t sure how long she’d been walking. Time seemed to have gone sideways.

At the heart of the basin stood a single structure: a spire of ice, impossibly tall, its shape warped like a mirror half-melted. The spire vibrated faintly, and inside it, something moved.

Not fast. Not urgent.

Just... watching.

Nettle took a breath and raised her wand. “I am Nettle Fernwhistle of the Bramblewood. Touched by the Vault, bearer of the rewritten thread. I am not here to bind or burn. I am here to know.”

The spire answered with silence.

But then the snow moved.

Not in the way that snow drifts. Not in wind or slide. It rose.

A figure formed from it — tall, androgynous, swaddled in white. Its face bore no features. Its presence was not hostile, but it radiated old magic, the kind that predated language. The kind that remembered the weight of ice before fire was born.

“I know you,” it said in a voice that came from inside her head. “You are the weft.”

Nettle’s hand tightened on her wand. “Weft of what?”

“Of story. Of self. Of what once was straight, but now bends.”

She swallowed. “Are you of Dreldein?”

“No,” said the figure. “I am of the Cold Root. I was silent long before the Hollow Crown dreamed its hunger. I watched the first names fall from lips that could no longer bear them. I held the mirror before he ever looked.”

Nettle’s breath misted before her, even though her wards should have kept it hidden. “Then you’ve seen him rise.”

“I have seen many rise,” the figure corrected. “But never like this. Dreldein forgets that the dream is not only his to shape.”

“Then why do nothing?”

The figure’s head tilted, a movement like snow slumping off a roof. “Because this story is no longer mine. It is yours. I am the Witness, not the Author.”

That word struck her: author.

A dozen thoughts fired in Nettle’s mind. Dreldein, for all his power, had never written — only rewritten. He corrupted, infected, borrowed. He took stories and turned them inward, made them reflect only him. But something else — something older — was watching.

“Is he here?” she asked.

The Witness nodded. “A shard. A memory. You may speak with it, if you are willing to be seen.”

Nettle gritted her teeth. “I’ve been seen before.”

She followed the figure to the base of the ice spire. With a gesture, the surface parted like breath on glass. Inside was a void — not cold, not warm, but hollow.

And in the center of that hollow, something floated.

It was a sliver — a fragment of thought, shaped like a child’s drawing of a crown. Not full, not whole, but active. It pulsed with recognition as she entered, and her stomach twisted as its voice laced the walls.

“Again, you,” it said. “The story thief.”

“You’re a parasite,” she answered, stepping closer. “You live in echoes and reflections. But the mirrors are cracking.”

“I am not a parasite,” it replied. “I am the parasite. I am the hunger between identities. I am what remains when belief fades. I fill the hollows left behind.”

“And what happens,” she asked slowly, “when there are no more hollows? When every thread is rewoven?”

The shard’s light dimmed, just slightly.

“Then I starve.”

There it was — truth, raw and simple. Dreldein wasn’t a god. He was a consequence.

And consequences could be undone.

Nettle reached into her coat and pulled out a second thread — the twin to the one she wore on her wrist. Eline had made it for her, woven from a dream where the world survived. It thrummed faintly in her palm.

“This is not a ward,” she said. “It’s not a trap. It’s a rewrite.”

She pressed the thread into the shard.

The reaction was immediate. A flare of light. A scream — not of pain, but of denial. The hollow twisted, trying to reject the story, but the thread held. Its truth was small, but bright: you are not necessary.

The shard cracked.

The hollow imploded.

And Nettle found herself kneeling in the snow, the Witness standing silently beside her.

“It begins,” it said. “The unraveling.”

“Of Dreldein?”

“Of everything he touched.”

Back in Thistledown Hollow, the change was already spreading.

The pools reflected true forms again. The trees stopped murmuring in forgotten dialects. The moths began to fly in spiral patterns once more — not loops. Patterns mattered. Small things, but powerful.

Tansy Elderroot sat in her chair, her eyes closed. She could feel it in her bones — a shift, subtle but wide-reaching. Something had loosened. Not snapped, not yet. But the forest breathed deeper.

And somewhere near the Pool of Whispers, Eline stood with Thomlin.

“You feel that?” she asked.

He nodded. “Like waking up twice in the same morning.”

Eline smiled, and her shadow smiled with her, no longer out of sync.

Nettle returned to her cottage and didn’t speak for a full day. She sat by the fire, tea cooling in her hand, the thread still tied around her wrist. The silence was no longer suffocating. It was restful. Earned.

Grack paced in front of her, occasionally pecking at the rug.

“You look tired.”

“I am.”

“Did you kill him?”

“No. I unneeded him.”

Grack blinked, then nodded. “That’s worse, isn’t it?”

“Much.”

They sat in silence for a while longer.

Finally, Grack sighed. “Well. What now?”

Nettle rose, took a fresh scroll from the shelf, and dipped her pen in ink made from midnight oil and dreampetal.

“Now,” she said, “we write the next chapter.”

The next morning came slowly, the sky reluctant to change. Frost lingered longer than it should have, silvering the grass and misting the windows of Nettle’s cottage with lace-like patterns. The air held the hush of something watching — not hostile, but deeply attentive, as if the land itself were listening to see what she would do next.

Nettle stood in the doorway, holding a mug of tea gone cold. The wind had shifted. She could feel it in her bones, in the way her magic twitched like a muscle beneath her skin. The Ley was flexing, adjusting to the absence of Dreldein’s grip. Where once the dark god’s threads had run taut and jagged across the world’s story, there were now places of soft unraveling — silence that meant rest, not erasure.

She stepped outside and let the frost cling to her boots. It was good, in a strange way, to feel weather again. Real weather. Not storm-forged by nightmares or rippling through the bones of ancient fear. Just cold. Just quiet.

Grack flapped down from the roof and landed with a thud on the moss-stone path.

“The birds say there was a dreamquake near Hollowmarsh,” he reported, hopping beside her.

“Was anyone hurt?” she asked without turning.

“No bodies. No screaming. But the reeds started singing in harmonics. That hasn’t happened in a hundred years.”

Nettle squinted toward the horizon. “It means a tether’s collapsing. Maybe one Dreldein left behind.”

“Or maybe one something else has begun to pull.”

Grack didn’t need to say more.

They both knew that unseating a godlike presence never left a vacuum for long. Something would rush in — not always darker, but always different. The world abhorred absence.

Nettle ran a hand through her hair, tangled and still damp with dew. “I’ll have to go,” she said. “Before the new weight settles wrong.”

“Eline wants to come,” Grack said. “She’s been practicing. Has her own thread now. Braided it into her hair like a proper dreamcaster.”

“She’s still raw.”

“She’s stronger than we were at her age.”

That was true, and deeply unsettling.

Nettle turned toward the inner glade, where Eline and Thomlin had taken up daily practice, spinning their threads and weaving them into illusions that shimmered faintly between the trees. They were learning quickly, too quickly — the magic clung to them now, as if seeking a new generation to carry what the old could not.

“She’s going to lead them one day,” Nettle murmured.

Grack flapped up onto a branch and looked at her sidelong. “And that terrifies you.”

“Yes,” Nettle said. “Because she might not get the chance to choose it.”

The Hollowmarsh lay northeast of the glade, past the Glistening Roots and the ridge of sighing stones. The journey was easier now than before — the land no longer fought the tread of her feet, no longer twisted paths behind her. Still, Nettle didn’t let her guard down. Some parts of the world remembered Dreldein’s whisper too fondly to let go so easily.

She arrived just before dusk.

The reeds were still singing — not in human voice, but in a strange chorus of resonance. A song made entirely of frequency and suggestion, rippling through the mist like the heartbeat of a sleeping thing. She stepped into the shallow marsh, water lapping around her ankles, and the sound shifted. Tuned itself to her.

Nettle closed her eyes.

The song coalesced into thought. Not a message. A memory.

She stood at the edge of the mirror. She reached. She fell through. And she became.

The vision wrapped around her, not showing, but inviting. She wasn’t just observing. She was part of it — the echo of a soul too fragile to bear weight, the shimmer of a truth never spoken aloud. The marsh remembered not what Dreldein had said, but what his victims had believed. It had stored their reflections.

And one of them had begun to sing.

Nettle moved toward the center of the water, where the silt grew deep and warm. There, rising from the surface like a memory refusing to be forgotten, was a statue. Not carved, not raised — grown. A sculpture of water and will, shaped like a child with no eyes.

She approached slowly, wand in one hand, thread in the other.

“Who are you?” she asked, not to the statue, but to the story surrounding it.

The song quieted.

Then came the answer — not words, but a presence. It poured over her like honey and dust, filled her lungs with a longing not her own.

“I am the silence Dreldein did not want. The truth he could not use. I am the unclaimed.”

The unclaimed.

A terrifying thought.

The statue moved slightly. Just a twitch of the hand. But it was enough.

Nettle whispered a spell — a recognition charm, one of the first things she’d ever learned — and flung the thread outward. It caught, snared the air around the figure, pulled taut, and glowed.

The thread did not bind it.

It revealed it.

Under the shimmer, the statue dissolved into a girl.

Young. Pale. Alive.

She fell into Nettle’s arms, gasping.

Her voice cracked like thin ice. “He left me behind. I was his voice, and he left me behind.”

Nettle held her tight. “You’re not a voice anymore. You’re a person. You get to choose.”

“But I don’t remember how,” the girl wept.

“Then we’ll remember together.”

They named her Corin. It was not her original name — that had been lost to the spire, to Dreldein’s hollow. But names were stories, and stories could be rewritten. Corin wore her new one like a second skin, light and strange, but growing more natural by the day.

Back in Thistledown, she joined the others in the glade. Eline took her in like a sister. Thomlin showed her how to listen to the wind again. And each morning, Nettle taught them how to thread their stories tighter — not to trap, but to shape.

For three nights, nothing stirred.

On the fourth, a scar opened in the sky.

It wasn’t wide. Just a hair-thin crack across the evening, a blackness too still to be night.

Nettle saw it from her rooftop.

Grack landed beside her, eyes hard. “You see it?”

“I feel it.”

“It’s not Dreldein.”

“No,” she whispered. “It’s something coming because of him.”

She stood and gathered her things.

“A crack like that,” she said, “means something outside is listening.”

“And if it’s listening,” Grack murmured, “it might want in.”

Nettle looked down at the clearing, at her students.

“At least this time, we won’t be alone.”

Chapter Five: The Sky That Fractured

The crack remained in the sky for two full days.

It didn’t grow, not exactly. Nor did it vanish. It hovered — thin, black, and wrong — slicing through cloud and color like a thread pulled too tightly across fabric. People noticed. Not just the fae, not just the Silence-born. Humans from the outer barrows began sending messages. Scribes recorded birds refusing to fly east. Weather patterns stalled. Spells that relied on starlight failed to function, and dreamers across the continent reported identical nightmares.

In each one, a voice whispered through a keyhole in the stars:
"You left the door ajar."

Nettle spent the first day walking the perimeter of the glade. The second, she spent inside her cottage, crafting a listening spell so delicate it could capture whispers carried only on intention. What it recorded wasn’t speech, but resonance — a sound like a heartbeat in reverse. Every time she played it back, her stomach turned over with dread.

Grack refused to sleep near the windows. Eline’s dreams began to bleed into the waking hours. Thomlin stopped speaking for a full twelve hours, eyes fixed on the crack as if watching something move just behind it. Only Corin remained quiet. Not calm, but purposeful. She seemed to be waiting for something.

On the third morning, she told Nettle why.

“There’s another,” she said as they walked beneath the flowering ash trees. “One more left behind. Not a voice. Not a dream. A root. He planted it before he began unraveling. A seed. It’s grown now.”

Nettle stopped, nearly dropping her satchel. “Where?”

“In the Between. The place stories go when they’re forgotten.”

Nettle swallowed. The Between wasn’t a physical place. It was the space between memory and myth, where unfinished tales drifted like smoke. Few had gone there willingly. Fewer had returned.

“We’d need a tether,” she said.

“I am one,” Corin replied. “I can open the door.”

“And what comes with us?”

“Only what knows its own name.”

The ritual required three things: a reflection from a mirror that had never seen its maker, a drop of blood from a Silence-born who had never spoken their dreams aloud, and a flame that burned from the breath of a spellcaster born during a lunar shift.

They had all three.

At midnight, in the clearing beneath the ash trees, they performed the invocation. Eline held the flame cupped in her palms. Thomlin let his blood drip into the soil, just three drops. Nettle laid the mirror on the ground, and Corin stepped into its reflection.

The air fractured. Not shattered — peeled. The world’s skin rolled back like a scroll opening too fast.

And they stepped through.

The Between was nothing like Nettle expected.

She’d imagined fog and silence, perhaps the flicker of unfinished stories clinging to misty cliff edges. Instead, it was loud. Not with noise, but with presence. Every inch of the place was stitched with half-thoughts, broken sentences, characters abandoned mid-scene. A cathedral of echoes, all stitched into the shape of a forest that never grew.

Above them, the sky pulsed with colors that did not exist in the waking world. Trees formed and re-formed as if trying to recall what they were supposed to be. Ground shuddered with every footfall, uncertain if it wanted to be soil or story.

Corin moved with unshaken purpose. “It’s near. I can feel it pulling. It wants us to find it.”

“Because it still thinks it’s Dreldein?” Eline asked.

“No,” Nettle said. “Because it wants to replace him.”

The path narrowed. Trees bent overhead. Somewhere in the distance, something sang in reverse — a melody played backward through the memory of an instrument. Nettle could feel the pressure building.

They reached a clearing.

In the center of it grew a tree.

Not a normal tree. It was made of script — bark etched in sentences, leaves folded from paragraphs, roots that coiled and twitched with living grammar. Each leaf told a different ending. Each root hummed a different beginning.

And at its base was a child.

No older than Eline or Thomlin. Pale, faceless, clothed in a cloak of fading ink.

It looked up as they approached.

“You found me,” it said.

Nettle stepped forward slowly. “You’re the Root. The last seed he left behind.”

“I was meant to grow in silence,” it said. “But now I’m loud. Now I’m unfinished. That hurts.”

Corin reached for it, but Nettle held her back.

“What do you want?” she asked the Root.

“I want a story,” it whispered. “My own. Not stolen. Not borrowed. One that stays.”

Eline stepped forward. “Then let us write you one.”

The Root tilted its head. “What kind?”

“One where you don’t belong to Dreldein. One where you’re free.”

The Root looked at each of them in turn.

“Do you promise not to forget me?”

Nettle reached into her coat and drew out the final scroll — the one she had been writing ever since the mirror cracked above the world. A blank story, bound in living thread.

“I promise,” she said, and offered the scroll.

The Root took it. Touched it.

And the Between screamed.

Not in pain.

In joy.

All around them, the unfinished stories sang out — voices restored, plots unpaused. The wind carried old names spoken aloud for the first time in centuries. The trees solidified. The colors faded into recognizable shapes.

And the Root glowed.

It didn’t vanish. It changed. It became a boy, hair dark as ink, eyes wide and clear. He stood, trembling.

“I think I’m me now,” he whispered.

Nettle smiled. “Then we can go home.”

They returned through the reflection in the scroll’s final line.

When they stepped out into the waking world, the sky had healed. The crack was gone. The stars sang again, faint but true. The world, at last, was exhaling.

Grack met them on the edge of the glade.

“Did you win?” he asked.

Nettle, exhausted, looked up at the sky.

“No,” she said. “We rewrote.”

And that was enough.

The boy who had once been the Root was quiet on the walk back.

His steps were light, as though he didn’t yet trust the ground to hold him. He touched everything: tree bark, dew-damp moss, the edges of flowers just beginning to open. His fingers trailed through sunlight like it was something unfamiliar. Each time he blinked, it was with the wonder of someone who had never closed their eyes voluntarily before.

Nettle watched him carefully. There was no immediate danger in him, no trace of Dreldein’s hunger. But there was something equally fragile—an unformed selfhood, the dangerous kind that others might shape if given the chance. She would not allow that.

“What should we call you?” Eline asked gently.

The boy paused and looked up at her, his head tilted in the same way Corin used to tilt hers when someone asked her to imagine something outside her memory. “I don’t know yet,” he said. “Can I wait until I feel it?”

Eline nodded with a small smile. “You can wait as long as you need.”

By the time they reached the edge of Thistledown Hollow, the sun was falling toward the horizon. Gold filtered through the bramble-shade in long, straight lines, and the trees whispered like content old men. Birds had returned, in twos and threes, and the silence that used to cling to the leaves had transformed into something gentler. Not absence. Stillness.

Tansy Elderroot was waiting for them near the Heartknot Tree, arms folded, staff planted firmly in the soil beside her. She examined the new boy with the kind of gaze that didn’t blink often and had seen too many mistakes repeated across too many centuries.

“Is it done?” she asked.

“No,” Nettle replied. “But he’s no longer part of it.”

Tansy raised a brow. “He was the Root.”

“He was a placeholder,” Nettle said. “A half-written idea. We gave him a beginning.”

“Beginnings come with endings.”

“So does everything.”

Tansy turned to the boy, studied him, and then nodded, slow and heavy. “He’ll need guidance.”

“He’ll have it.”

And then, for the first time in Nettle’s memory, Tansy smiled—not a warm smile, but one of acceptance. Of concession.

“I’ll assign him a nameward,” she said. “Until he finds his own.”

The Hollow adapted quickly.

Children who once walked in circles through their dreams now found paths forward. Elders who hadn’t spoken aloud in decades began to share the names they had given up for safety. The trees no longer twisted their roots to hide ancient scars; instead, they let shoots grow in places they had long denied. The land was changing—slowly, cautiously, but with purpose.

Grack took to perching outside the apprentice grove, where Eline and Thomlin had begun teaching others. His commentary was as useless as it was constant.

“That’s not how you summon a firefly,” he would croak. “They’re not moths with lanterns, they are the lanterns. You can’t bribe them with sugar.”

“You could just let them learn,” Nettle said once, amused.

“I could,” Grack answered. “But then who would annoy them into greatness?”

Nettle didn’t argue. She’d begun to understand that annoying was his love language.

Corin, too, changed in the weeks that followed. She grew stronger in silence, choosing her words with care. She often sat with the boy who had been Root, sharing stories like threads—thin and bright and flexible. Sometimes he asked questions. Sometimes he just listened.

One afternoon, she came to Nettle carrying a woven charm: a ring of bark, wrapped in dreamthread and dyed with sunset pigments.

“He picked a name,” Corin said.

Nettle put down her pen. “What is it?”

“He wants to be called Vey.”

She nodded. “Vey. That’s a good name.”

“He says it sounds like a sigh at the end of a long dream.”

“It does,” Nettle agreed. “And he’s earned one.”

But peace, like all rare things, never lasted long in Thistledown.

The first warning came not in word, but in instinct. The trees bent against the wind in the wrong direction. Streams began reversing for seconds at a time. Small things—too small to matter, perhaps, but Nettle noticed. And when the air stopped tasting like summer and began to hum with buried frost, she knew.

The Between hadn’t closed. It had shifted.

One morning, she stood before her cottage and held her hand to the earth. The leyline beneath her trembled, and for a moment, her vision filled with colors she didn’t recognize—shades that didn’t belong to her spectrum. She saw things that didn’t belong to any waking dream: spirals coiling into themselves, mouths with no language, stars blinking out in sequence.

Grack, sensing the shift, swooped down from the watchtree.

“You felt it too,” he said.

“Yes,” Nettle answered, low. “But it’s not Dreldein.”

“No.”

“Something older?”

Grack’s silence was long. “Something hungrier.”

The Eldergrove gathered for the first time in a generation.

Pixies, whisperfolk, barkbloods, even the glasswings of the coast sent delegates. The moot was called not by tree, but by tether—those whose stories had crossed into the Between and returned marked. Nettle was among them, as were Eline, Corin, and Vey, who now stood tall among his peers, no longer a fragment.

The Oak spoke first. Its voice had grown slower since the last time Nettle stood in its shadow.

“The Hollow Crown has faded. But in its echo, a door has opened.”

The Yew, older still, continued. “The Between stirs. Not in dream. In hunger. It has no name. Yet it listens.”

The Birch, ever impatient, leaned forward. “So what do we do? Close the crack? Build a wall? Burn the forest?”

“It’s not in the forest anymore,” Nettle said. “It’s beneath the forest. Beneath the story. It has always been.”

Tansy Elderroot stepped beside her. “She’s right. This isn’t a wound. It’s a mouth.”

The moot fell into silence.

Then the Thorn laughed. “Then it’s simple. We feed it something it cannot chew.”

The room turned toward Nettle.

“You want me to enter the Between again.”

“We want you to anchor it,” said the Oak. “Before something else does.”

Nettle exhaled.

“Then I’ll need a story sharper than teeth.”

Preparations for the second crossing into the Between began the next morning, but this time it was not a ritual performed in the shadows of a cottage or the hush of a glade. The entire Hollow moved with purpose — not panic, but unity. Threads of magic were reinforced through song. Wards were recast on the stones at every boundary. Stories were told and retold by firelight, some for remembrance, others to make sure the world remembered itself.

Because forgetting, as Nettle had learned, was the first invitation to erasure.

Eline braided dreamthread through her hair again, but this time without hesitation. Her fingers moved quickly, fluidly, and with confidence. Corin stood beside her, wrapping her own braid in a circle of whisperglass — a charm meant to hold the bearer’s name close even when the self faltered. Thomlin practiced mirror-wards, not for defense, but as signals — messages to send back if they were pulled too far from memory.

And Vey, once a silent figment of someone else's prophecy, now carried a wand of woven hornbeam, etched with new runes. His voice was soft, but no longer hollow.

Nettle took all this in from her cottage door. She watched them without speaking, without smiling, her hands folded behind her back. She wasn’t thinking of her own path anymore. She was thinking of what the world would look like if they failed. And more dangerously — what it might look like if they succeeded, and the Between began to reshape itself around them.

At dusk, she walked to the Eldergrove one last time.

There, beneath the twisted canopy of sentient trees, the moot presented her with a talisman: a stone seed, smooth as river-worn bone and faintly warm to the touch. The Oak spoke as it was handed over.

“This is not a weapon. It is a story’s core. If you lose yourself in the Between, plant it. It will grow toward what is true.”

Nettle nodded, accepting the gift without ceremony. She didn’t need speeches. The task ahead of her was too close to reverence already. She tucked the seed into the inner pocket of her cloak and returned to the glade where her companions waited.

Grack fluttered beside her, preening but tense.

“They still think you’ll be able to rewrite it,” he muttered.

“Not it,” Nettle said. “Us.”

The second crossing was cleaner, faster — not because the Between had become more welcoming, but because Nettle and the others no longer feared it. It knew them now, and they knew how to speak back.

Still, the moment they stepped through the veil of thread and story, the shift was unmistakable. The Between had changed. Gone was the uncertain mist and ever-reforming landscape. In its place stood a vast city of bone and parchment — a metropolis constructed from the dreams of the forgotten. Towers stitched from rejection letters, roads paved with abandoned outlines, doorways into epilogues that had never been written.

And rising in the center, where the weight of stories pulled deepest, was a cathedral shaped like an open book. Its pages turned in the wind, though there was no breeze.

“It’s sentient now,” Corin whispered. “The Between... it’s dreaming on its own.”

“No,” said Nettle, scanning the horizon. “It’s remembering. Something came before Dreldein. Something that never spoke.”

Vey stepped to her side. “It wants a name.”

They walked through the silent city, past alleyways where echoes waited like dogs, through plazas filled with statues of characters who had never found their endings. The ground pulsed with narrative tension — a world trying to choose a genre and failing.

They reached the cathedral doors.

There were no locks. Only a single phrase inscribed across the arch in a language none of them had studied, but all of them understood:

Only the unwritten may pass.

Grack glanced at Nettle. “So I stay behind.”

“You’re written,” she said.

“And damn proud of it.”

Eline, Corin, Vey, and Thomlin entered beside her.

Inside, the cathedral was quiet — not the emptiness of abandonment, but the kind of quiet found in libraries after closing, when the shelves hum with memory and the air is too full of pages not to be sacred. Columns rose into nothing. Every wall was covered in lines of text, written by invisible hands, in every language ever spoken. Their footsteps did not echo.

At the center of the cathedral stood a dais.

And above it hovered the Void Seed.

It was black, but not colorless. Shifting. Deep. It seemed to pulse in time with their heartbeats, mirroring every fear, every unfinished line, every memory not fully claimed. The essence of what had never been spoken aloud.

Nettle stepped forward.

The Seed reacted.

Words spilled from it like blood from a wound. Names she had never said. Stories she had never written. Every version of herself she had left behind.

One by one, her companions formed a circle around her.

Eline held a mirror, turned outward. Corin began to hum the song she’d learned from the reeds. Vey reached into his cloak and withdrew his nameward — glowing softly now, no longer just a charm but a declaration.

Nettle drew her wand.

And with it, she carved one word into the air:

Anchor.

The void shuddered.

It tried to pull away — to scatter, to flee into the corners of the Between, into the folds of unspoken possibility. But they were ready. Together, they cast the net of their combined story — each thread a different truth, woven not from prophecy, but from choice. It wrapped the Seed in story, in selfhood.

And slowly, the darkness began to change.

It was no longer a void.

It was potential.

It had been a question. Now it could become an answer.

Nettle stepped forward and pressed the Eldergrove’s talisman into its core.

The ground split — not destructively, but like the final page of a long-closed book finally opening.

A new root grew.

And from it came the first leaf of something older than Dreldein, older than even the forest.

A truth that needed no crown.

Chapter Six: Roots That Remember

The Between did not close when the void changed. It did not collapse, nor did it fade like mist under sun. It transformed. The moment the root sprouted from the center of the cathedral, the very texture of the world shifted. No longer did the air tremble with indecision. No longer did the ground flicker beneath uncertain feet. The story beneath the story had accepted its shape.

But what grew in the wake of that acceptance was not peace.

It was complexity.

As Nettle and the others stepped away from the dais, the walls of the cathedral bent outward, reshaping into new forms — less rigid, less canonical. The text on the walls no longer streamed in endless, unknowable languages. Instead, it settled into patches of quiet, with names and ideas slowly blooming like wildflowers among weeds.

“Is this... healing?” Thomlin asked, glancing at the others.

“No,” Corin said, laying her hand on a pillar that now pulsed like slow breath. “This is growth. Healing is what happens after something breaks. This place was never broken. Just... untended.”

Vey ran his fingers along the dais where the Void Seed had hovered. “It’s remembering itself.”

“And rewriting,” Nettle added, her voice low, gaze distant. “We changed it. Which means everything connected to it might begin to shift as well.”

Outside the cathedral, the city built from abandoned ideas had already begun to transform. Roads once made of lost words were becoming paths of possibility — fluid, reframing their direction with each new step. Towers twisted downward, burrowing into the foundation like roots rather than stretching aimlessly toward a sky that never fully existed.

Grack, who had waited beyond the archway with talon-tapping impatience, flapped to Nettle’s side the moment she emerged.

“You’re alive,” he croaked. “And not turned into a poetic puddle of sentiment. That’s new.”

She gave him a tired half-smile. “Still stitched together. Mostly.”

Grack eyed the others as they emerged behind her. “No one missing?”

“No,” Eline said, her tone gentle but firm. “But something’s different. In us. Not broken. Just... more.”

Nettle understood what she meant. She felt it too. The moment they had stepped into the Between, they had been tethered to the deep mechanics of story. And now, after shaping its trajectory, a piece of it lived within each of them — not like possession, but like root-bound symbiosis.

They were no longer merely storytellers. They were conduits.

The return to Thistledown was quiet, but not subdued. The forest, sensing the shift, responded with an alert calm. Trees shed old bark and grew fresh moss. Dreamflowers opened in full daylight. Even the stones — long asleep beneath root and soil — began to hum with ancient song again.

Tansy Elderroot met them at the edge of the glade. Her face betrayed nothing, but Nettle saw the way her eyes scanned each face, searching for fractures, distortions, signs of tether corruption.

When she found none, she gave a single nod and stepped aside.

“We felt it,” she said. “The change. The humming in the sky. The stilling of the mirrors. You brought back something new.”

“I didn’t bring it back,” Nettle corrected. “We gave it permission to exist.”

Tansy regarded her for a long moment. “And what is it?”

“Truth,” Nettle said, then hesitated. “But not as a blade. As a garden. Untamed, uneven. Alive.”

“Then it will need tending.”

“It already has gardeners.”

Tansy looked past her, to the others — Eline, Thomlin, Corin, and Vey, standing in a loose line, not as students, but as peers.

The elder woman smiled, small and tired. “So it begins.”

The changes unfolded slowly, in ripples.

Some of the dream-afflicted began waking on their own, claiming voices they hadn’t used in decades. Old magic that had refused to work under Dreldein’s influence flickered back to life, awkward but willing. Songs returned to the lips of riverfolk, and the hollow wells stopped singing backwards.

But not everything was calm.

With the Between shifting, other things came loose. Dormant prophecies twitched back to life. Forgotten names stirred in grave-moss. The line between memory and myth, once thin and strict, grew porous. New creatures emerged — not hostile, not corrupted, but curious. Things that had no category, no taxonomy. Things that had waited in the half-space between idea and existence.

Nettle documented each one as best she could, keeping records stitched in bark-paged journals wrapped in iron-thread. She sent messages to the Crystal Archive, to the Weaver’s Hollow, even to the coastal song-keepers. Most responded. A few did not.

Eline began traveling beyond Thistledown, searching for others like them — tethers, echoes, dream-walkers. She found three in the River Fens, two more in the Frostbell caves, and an entire village in the Blackbramble that had learned to speak only in metaphor.

Corin remained in the glade, building what she called the Garden of Unfinished Lines — a sanctuary for stories that hadn’t yet found endings. She guided children through dreams, helped them reshape the nightmares Dreldein had left behind. Not with power, but with invitation.

Thomlin studied mirror-magic, becoming a quiet expert on reflection and reversal. He rarely spoke in groups, but when he did, others listened.

And Vey — Vey who had once been Root — became the keeper of memory. He walked the perimeter of the Hollow each evening, whispering every story he could remember into the bark of trees, making sure the land would never forget again.

One night, Nettle stood alone at the Pool of Whispers.

The water reflected only the sky — no future, no visions, just a pale constellation of stars beginning to blink into place. The air was cool. The wind spoke in patterns she no longer had to translate.

Grack landed beside her.

“You’re not restless,” he said, a little surprised.

“No,” she agreed. “I’ve never been this close to peace before.”

“Doesn’t suit you.”

“It’s not supposed to.”

They stood in silence.

Finally, Nettle asked, “Do you think Dreldein is truly gone?”

Grack preened a feather, then shrugged. “No. But I think he doesn’t matter anymore.”

“That’s almost scarier.”

“It is,” he said. “Because now it’s up to you.”

“Not just me,” she said, and smiled. “Us.”

And the forest, the glade, the pool, and all the stories still unwritten—they listened.

As the seasons turned, the Hollow changed alongside them. Summer bled into a soft, smoke-laced autumn, and with it came a new texture to the air: not unease, but alertness, like the land was paying closer attention than it ever had. It wasn't just that the world had shifted after their second journey into the Between—it was that the world knew it had changed, and was now waiting to see what came of it.

In the mornings, mists rolled through the glade earlier than expected. They coiled low around tree trunks, curling like questions, carrying sounds in strange directions. The trees didn’t speak in the old ways anymore. Their groans and creaks carried subtle rhythm, like music being composed in real time. Eline said she could sometimes feel chords forming in the leaves when she walked the borders. Thomlin claimed the wind in the reeds had begun to imitate lullabies.

Nettle began to suspect something larger was occurring—not loud, not sudden, but foundational.

One day, while tending to her shelf of bound memories, a single book slipped from its place. Not fell—slipped, as though intentionally making itself known. It was a slender thing, no thicker than her thumb, bound in bark with silver stitching around the spine. She didn’t remember writing it.

When she opened the cover, she found one line written on the first page in unfamiliar script:

Every ending leaves a root.

She stared at it for a long time. It was a simple line, but it carried weight, the kind that echoed across thoughts, tugging at ideas she hadn’t fully formed yet.

Grack noticed her silence from his perch above the hearth.

“You look like you’ve eaten a riddle.”

“This isn’t mine,” Nettle said.

“You’re holding it.”

“But it isn’t mine,” she insisted, frowning. “I didn’t write this.”

Grack dropped to the floor and peered at the book. “Then someone did. And they wanted you to see it.”

There were no more pages after the first. No story, no poetry, not even a table of contents. Just the single sentence and a blankness so total it felt intentional.

Later that night, when she took the book to bed and tucked it beside her other notes, she dreamed not of Dreldein or of shadows or of stars blinking out.

She dreamed of roots.

Roots that twisted through stone and memory. Roots that reached backward through time and forward into stories yet to be spoken. In the dream, she stood at the center of a forest she did not know—a forest that knew her. The ground was warm. The canopy was thick with unread stories, dangling like fruit too heavy to stay put. The roots pressed upward beneath her feet, not threatening, but eager.

They were looking for someone to tell them where to go.

When she woke, the book was gone. In its place was a single seed, no larger than a fingernail, the same shade as the night sky between stars. When she held it in her palm, it throbbed once—like a heartbeat—and then fell still.

She consulted the others one by one.

Eline saw it and grew quiet. “It’s a beginning. But it comes with something behind it. It’s not dangerous. Just… lonely.”

Thomlin didn’t want to touch it, but he stood near it for a while and said, “It hums like it wants a name.”

Corin took it in her hands, turned it slowly, and said, “It’s not from the Between. It’s from something deeper.”

Vey, the boy who had once been a figment, held the seed gently and nodded. “It’s asking permission to exist.”

Nettle placed it in the center of the glade, near the place where the Dreamflower Grove met the Sighing Stones. She circled it three times, humming a tune with no name, and then whispered a story into the soil around it. A story of a world that wanted to be kind but didn’t know how. A story about a girl who loved her magic even though it scared her. A story that didn’t end in battle, but in choice.

Then she buried the seed and walked away.

That night, it rained.

Softly. Not enough to flood or wash or erase. Just enough to bless the ground.

In the morning, something green had sprouted from the soil.

In the weeks that followed, more signs appeared.

A child in a northern hamlet woke from a years-long sleep and recited, in perfect meter, a poem no one had taught them. A crow in the Eastwood began to speak in dream-riddles, giving answers to questions not yet asked. And beneath the surface of the Reflection Marsh, mirrored glyphs formed on the water’s edge—shapes that matched no known tongue, but which made sense when spoken aloud.

The world was not breaking.

It was rewriting.

Nettle began traveling again, not with urgency, but with purpose. She spoke with river witches, cave-born scholars, wind-walkers who carved messages into clouds. All agreed that something new was blooming. And not one of them believed it was entirely safe.

But none of them feared it.

When she returned home, the sprout in the glade had become a sapling. Not large. Not magical in any dramatic, spark-filled way. Just... persistent. Healthy. Real.

Grack perched on the lowest branch.

“You think it’ll grow into something big?” he asked.

“I hope not,” she replied. “I hope it grows into something wise.”

He tilted his head. “You’ve changed.”

“We all have,” she said. “We were part of something vast. And now we’re part of something small again. But small doesn’t mean unimportant.”

The sapling leaned slightly in the breeze. It looked like it was listening.

That night, Nettle took out a new scroll. Blank. Crisp. Waiting.

She began writing.

This is not a tale of crowns or gods. This is not a warning. This is not even a memory.

This is the story that followed.

This is the tale of the root that remembered.

And far away, in places where no one had yet walked, the ground began to stir.

Chapter Seven: The Language Beneath

By the time frost touched the outer edges of Thistledown Hollow, the sapling had grown as high as Nettle’s shoulder. Its bark was pale and smooth, like moonlight trapped in wood, and its leaves shimmered faintly with a language no one could quite read—glyphs that flickered only in peripheral vision, shapes that changed depending on how you approached them. The forest had accepted it. So had the birds. Even the oldest stones nearby began to warm slightly when the sapling’s roots brushed them.

But it wasn’t just a tree.

Not entirely.

Every few days, someone in the Hollow would dream of it—not as it was, but as it might become. In one dream, it bloomed with mirror-flowers that whispered the names of forgotten people. In another, it hummed songs composed of old prayers that had never found a god to answer them. Nettle herself had dreamed of its leaves unfolding into pages, each inscribed with the beginnings of stories that had never been written.

It was more than a symbol. It was potential, rooted in the present but branching into countless futures.

One cold morning, Vey approached Nettle’s cottage carrying a bowl filled with ink-thistle berries and snow-melt. He’d been helping the younger tethers craft memory-charms, and he wanted to test something new.

“If you write a story beside the sapling,” he said, “I think it responds. Like it listens.”

Nettle raised an eyebrow. “Responds how?”

“The glyphs change. Just slightly. They mimic the rhythm of what you wrote.”

“And how do you know it’s not coincidence?”

Vey hesitated. “Because I wrote a lie once, and the bark turned gray. For days.”

That was enough for Nettle. That afternoon, she sat beneath the sapling and told it a simple tale—a love story between two moths who only met once every decade under a specific moon. She spoke it aloud rather than writing, letting the sound of it drift into the winter air.

When she finished, the leaves rustled gently, though there was no wind.

She stared at them, narrowing her eyes.

The glyphs on the underside of one leaf had shifted. Instead of curling shapes, they had flattened into even lines. A poem, she realized. A response.

The sapling had not just understood.

It had answered.

They began calling it the Rootspeaker.

It was a name born of both reverence and practicality. As more visitors arrived—magicians, lore-weavers, sleepwalkers—more patterns began to emerge. The tree responded best to stories with unresolved endings, especially those told with emotional honesty. Exaggeration caused it to fade. Irony made it cold. But sincerity? That stirred the glyphs into motion.

Word spread slowly, but inevitably. Not as rumor, but as curiosity. The Hollow, once a place of guarded whispers and hidden scars, became a destination for storytellers who had lost their endings. They came not to be healed, but to understand. The Rootspeaker did not offer answers. It asked questions back.

One day, an aging cartographer came with a map he could no longer complete. It was meant to chart the last continent that no one remembered how to reach. He read his maps aloud to the tree, trembling. After a long pause, the Rootspeaker unfurled a single branch toward the northeast, bending ever so slightly—not enough to give a path, but enough to suggest one.

The cartographer left the next day, whistling.

Another time, a child who had never spoken came to sit beside the roots and hummed a single note for hours. The Rootspeaker responded by dropping a leaf shaped like a musical key.

Not magic in the expected sense. But resonance. Echo.

Meaning.

Not everyone accepted it so easily.

Some of the elder fae feared what the Rootspeaker might become. They remembered Dreldein’s promises, and the way seductive power dressed itself in prophecy. The Eldergrove convened again, sending a delegation to observe, to test, to weigh. Nettle stood with them in the glade, arms crossed, as they cast scrying spells and ran truth-loops across its roots.

After a long day of examination, the Oak pronounced its judgment.

“This is not Dreldein reborn,” it said. “But it is born from the wound he left.”

“And wounds,” added the Ash, “must be watched.”

Nettle didn’t argue. She understood. The Rootspeaker was not a relic. It was a seed of something new, and new things scared those who’d lived too long in a cycle of destruction and return.

So she made them a promise.

“It will grow only as far as we’re willing to tend it,” she said. “It won’t bloom because it must. It will bloom because we choose to nurture it.”

That appeased them—for now.

Winter deepened, and the Hollow moved with it.

The dreamers began sharing tales in the evenings beside the Rootspeaker, wrapping themselves in wool and memory. Vey collected these stories and copied them in his careful script, binding them in books that would later become the first volumes of the Living Archive. Corin expanded the Garden of Unfinished Lines, carving spaces in the snow for stories too broken to carry weight. Eline taught the next generation of tethers how to listen, not just to dreams, but to the truths beneath them.

And Nettle?

She began to forget what it felt like to fight.

Not because the world had grown safe—far from it. But because she had stopped being its shield. She had become its soil. She fed it, and it grew.

One evening, as snow blanketed the glade, she sat beside the Rootspeaker with Grack dozing on her shoulder and began writing a letter she would never send.

To the first girl I was—the one who thought magic would always hurt:

It doesn’t. Not always. But it does change you.

You’ll lose parts of yourself. Names. Beliefs. People. But you’ll also find new ones. You’ll carry them in your bones like stories too short to tell aloud.

And someday, you’ll plant something that asks questions instead of giving answers.

And that will be enough.

She folded the letter, pressed it into the snow beneath the Rootspeaker’s bark, and watched as the tree curled a root gently around it.

No consumption. No disappearance.

Just... holding.

Remembering.

And when she walked away, the glyphs on the leaves spelled only one thing.

Thank you.

That winter, the Hollow became a place where stories were planted like seeds. Some sprouted quickly, stretching into the world as truths freshly spoken. Others took longer, coiling deep into the earth before daring to reach for light. The Rootspeaker stood in the center of it all, neither commanding nor silent, simply present—an anchor for possibility.

But as the snows deepened and the days grew short, something else began to stir beyond the Hollow’s borders. Strange winds reached the Hollow’s edge—not cold winds, nor fast, but laced. Threaded with faint voices and the scent of parchment not yet inked. Dreams that had once bloomed softly now ended abruptly, with an edge like a page torn mid-sentence. Children reported waking in the middle of night unable to recall who they had been just hours before. It wasn’t fear they felt, but disorientation, as though they had become part of a story that someone else had started writing.

Nettle first noticed the difference when she woke one morning and couldn’t remember which tea blend she had invented the night before. She could see the herbs—lavender, nettle leaf, stonefruit rind—but the name had disappeared from her mind entirely. Not just forgotten—erased. She hadn’t even written it in her recipe ledger. Her memory had a perfect blank where it used to be.

Later that morning, Thomlin approached her in the glade, eyes wide, holding an empty book.

“I was writing a story,” he said. “About the marshlight hunters. I had a whole chapter finished. But when I opened the book today... it was gone. Not torn. Just never there.”

Nettle took the book from him and ran her fingers over the pages. There was no residue of ink. No indentations from pen. As if the paper had been unmarked from the moment of its making.

She looked to the Rootspeaker.

It did not respond.

The glyphs on its bark were still. Not silent, but withheld, like lips pursed against speech.

That was when Nettle understood: something had begun to consume narrative itself.

Later that night, she called the others—Eline, Corin, Vey, Thomlin—to her cottage. Grack was already pacing by the hearth, agitated in that way he got when his feathers bristled despite no wind.

“It’s happening again,” he said before she could speak. “Not Dreldein. Not exactly. But something born of the gap he left.”

“He was a parasite,” Corin said, arms folded. “This feels more like... decay.”

“No,” Eline said. “Decay leaves bones. This leaves nothing.”

Vey stood near the window, eyes fixed on the dark treetops outside. “The Between is bleeding.”

At that, the room fell silent.

Nettle moved to her workbench and unrolled the map she had drawn after their last journey—an etched record of the Between’s shape, boundaries, pulse points. She traced a finger toward the eastern edge, where the lines began to blur.

“Here,” she said. “This was stable. A well of echoes, a space for forgotten beginnings. But I checked it this morning.”

She pointed to a blank corner of the parchment. “It’s missing. Not corrupted. Just... not there.”

“The void isn’t screaming anymore,” Thomlin said quietly. “It’s listening.”

That frightened Nettle more than anything else.

Because a thing that listens without identity, without memory, without anchor—that thing isn’t asleep.

It’s waiting.

They returned to the Rootspeaker at moonrise, hoping for guidance.

It stood as it always had, gently radiant, leaves still whispering stories from the day. But as Nettle stepped closer, she saw a shift.

At the base of the trunk, something had begun to curl: a vine, dark and thin, growing backwards. Not against gravity, but against time. Its leaves didn’t shimmer—they dulled the air around them, drawing story-light into themselves like ink bleeding through paper.

She touched the vine.

A sharp sting shot through her fingers, not pain but sudden unknowing. For a full second, she couldn’t recall her name.

She staggered back, and the others caught her.

“It’s feeding,” she said. “Feeding on memory. On presence. On narrative.”

Vey knelt beside the vine, careful not to touch it directly.

“It doesn’t belong to the Rootspeaker,” he said. “It’s inside it. But it didn’t come from it.”

Grack landed with a hiss. “Then it’s a graft. A foreign thread trying to overwrite.”

“Or sever,” Eline said.

Corin stood slowly, her face pale. “What happens if it reaches the heartwood?”

No one answered.

The next morning, the Rootspeaker dropped a leaf.

It had never done so before—not even in wind or winter or rain.

The leaf was pure white. Smooth. Blank.

Nettle turned it over in her hand, waiting for glyphs, for shimmer.

Nothing came.

And suddenly she understood: the vine’s presence wasn’t corruption.

It was erasure.

This wasn’t Dreldein’s hunger for form. This was something worse. Something that sought to unmake the possibility of story itself.

A cold understanding took root in her mind: the Between had not only shifted. It had been wounded.

Something—perhaps someone—had begun cutting out stories at the root. Not twisting them. Not claiming them.

Removing them.

This wasn’t just a threat to Thistledown.

This was a threat to the architecture of narrative itself.

“We have to go back,” she said that night, as the wind carried with it no sounds, only echoes. “One more time. Into the Between.”

Eline nodded immediately. Thomlin looked scared but resolute. Corin said nothing, only packed her satchel. Vey, the youngest of them, the one who had been Root and now bore a name of his choosing, placed his palm against the Rootspeaker.

“This time,” he said, “we don’t go to rewrite.”

“No,” Nettle agreed. “This time... we go to remember.”

And far beneath their feet, the roots of the Hollow curled tighter, as though bracing themselves against a future even they could not yet name.

The days that followed were filled with quiet urgency. Not panic—never that—but a kind of solemn clarity. Everyone in Thistledown Hollow seemed to sense that something delicate and deep was being lost, and they moved with the careful intent of those trying not to step too loudly inside a breaking temple.

Nettle spent the mornings weaving new wards, though she knew most would not hold against erasure. Traditional magic relied on memory, on structure, on belief that a spell had meaning. But what they now faced unmade meaning. It turned spells to suggestion, suggestion to silence. Each ward she made felt thinner than the last, a wall built of echoes in a place that had forgotten how to listen.

Corin crafted a charm from ash-root and hollowglass, something designed not to shield but to anchor. "If it takes you," she said, placing it into Nettle’s hand, "this will remind the Between where to put you back."

“I’d rather not be taken at all,” Nettle said.

Corin gave a soft smile. “Then you’ll need a story strong enough to carry you.”

Eline was already preparing their passage. Of all of them, she had become most attuned to the shape of the Between—the way it shifted, the rhythm of its mood, how to step between the threads without getting tangled. She carried herself like a song waiting for a crescendo, her steps as quiet as breath but never hesitant.

Vey, meanwhile, had changed in ways none of them entirely understood. He no longer flinched at sudden memories. He no longer looked around as though expecting something to claim him. Instead, he moved through the Hollow as though he had grown with it—from it. When he placed his hands against the Rootspeaker, it responded instantly. The glyphs glowed only for him now, flickering softly like heartbeat-light through bark.

“It knows I’ve seen the other side,” he told Nettle. “It remembers me even when I don’t.”

“And does it fear what’s coming?”

“It doesn’t know how to fear. But it wants to live.”

That, more than anything, solidified the decision. They would return to the Between—not to change it, not even to fix it, but to understand who or what was trying to cut it apart from within.

The Between could survive madness, dreams, even gods like Dreldein. But if it lost story, if it lost memory itself, it would unravel into quiet.

And that kind of quiet could never be unmade.

The crossing was different this time.

They stepped not through a portal or a mirror or a woven thread, but through a moment. Eline called it “the breath between questions”—a space so small and precise that you could only pass through if you didn’t mean to. They gathered around the Rootspeaker as the snow fell and told a story together, slowly, with no ending. And when the tale reached its pause—the part where the question hung in the air—they simply stepped forward.

And the world let them through.

The Between greeted them with unfamiliar silence. Not the strained hush of anticipation, but a dead quiet that felt deliberate, like the echo of something erased.

What remained of the city they had once seen—the towers of bone and parchment, the cathedral of story—was gone.

In its place was a field of blankness. Not white. Not black. Just absence. It swallowed definition. Even their footsteps left no mark.

Corin was the first to speak. “It’s been severed.”

“More than severed,” Nettle said, crouching and touching the ground. “It’s been forgotten.”

The air carried no scent. There was no horizon. The sky was the same color as the earth, and above them nothing moved. There was no up. No down. Only memory standing very still.

Until Vey reached for her hand.

He pointed.

Far in the distance—if distance had meaning here—there was movement. A small thing. Flickering. It blinked into place like punctuation in a long, empty sentence.

As they approached, they realized it wasn’t a thing, but a person.

A girl. No older than ten. Sitting cross-legged on the blank ground, drawing invisible shapes into the air.

She looked up at them without surprise.

“I’ve been waiting,” she said.

Nettle knelt before her. “What are you?”

The girl tilted her head. “I’m the last page.”

Eline froze. “Of what?”

“Of the story that never wanted to end.”

Nettle’s breath caught. “The story of the Between?”

The girl nodded. “But someone started writing new endings. Endings that sealed. That cut. They thought they were saving the world by simplifying it. But stories aren’t meant to be clean. They’re meant to grow.”

“Who’s cutting the pages?” Thomlin asked.

The girl looked up, eyes suddenly wide with sadness. “You are.”

They stepped back as one.

“What do you mean?” Nettle asked slowly.

“You started rewriting,” she said, not accusing, only describing. “Dreldein twisted the story. You came and corrected it. That taught the Between it could be shaped. And once it knew that... someone else decided it could be controlled.”

Vey’s voice was hollow. “Who?”

The girl raised one hand and pointed behind them.

They turned.

A shape stood in the distance. Not threatening. Not monstrous. But exact. It was built of rules. Of expectations. A tower of form. It resembled nothing and everything: part archive, part judge, part mirror.

“The Editor,” the girl whispered. “Born from the moment you decided one story was better than another.”

Nettle’s knees buckled. “No…”

“It’s not evil,” the girl said. “But it doesn’t understand wildness. It only knows how to refine. It thinks it’s helping. It wants to prune away all uncertainty. All roots.”

Grack let out a low, hopeless caw.

“This place is made of might-have-beens,” he said. “You can’t trim it without killing it.”

The girl stood. “There’s only one way to stop it. You have to give the Between its mess back. Its chaos. Its roughness. Let it tangle. Let it be wrong sometimes.”

Eline swallowed. “You want us to... make it forget perfection?”

“I want you to stop making sense.”

Nettle looked at her friends. Then at the tower. Then at the blankness stretching endlessly.

“I think I know what to do.”

She sat down.

And she began to tell a story that contradicted itself.

Every paragraph unraveled the one before it. Every character betrayed the structure. She changed tenses mid-sentence. She abandoned arcs halfway through. She inserted dreams with no anchor, flashbacks to lives never lived, names that had never been spoken aloud.

She made it wild.

Corin added a poem that rhymed in no language. Vey added a history of a kingdom that existed in reverse. Thomlin whistled a tune that meant different things depending on where you stood.

Eline began dancing.

And slowly, the Between began to flicker. To remember how to breathe.

Behind them, the Editor cracked.

It didn’t fall.

It unwrote itself.

And in the space it left behind, the silence softened.

Not vanished. Not defeated.

But reclaimed.

Chapter Eight: A Garden of Wild Ends

They emerged from the Between just as the first thaw of spring touched the Hollow. Snow still clung in the shadows, but the streams had begun to speak again—soft whispers that wrapped around stone and root like language made liquid. The air smelled of damp moss and the first petals daring to open.

No one noticed their return at first. It was as if the world had taken a long breath and, in doing so, missed the subtle shift of presence. When the village lights flickered gently that evening, and the Rootspeaker let loose a gust of warm pollen scented like dusk, people began to realize: something had changed.

Not loudly. But deeply.

The Rootspeaker had grown. Not taller—its height remained modest, a polite reach toward sky—but broader, its roots now curling visibly above ground like arms stretched in comfort. Its leaves no longer shimmered with precise glyphs. Instead, they rustled with color. Each leaf bore a different hue, not tied to season or temperature, but to emotion. When Nettle approached it after her return, the leaves turned the soft gold of gratitude.

“It knows,” she whispered.

And it did. The Between had survived.

But not unchanged.

Stories had always lived in Thistledown Hollow. Some told, others buried. A few wrapped in rhyme or tangled into spells. But now, the Hollow had become something more: a refuge not just for stories but for possibility.

The Editor was gone—dispersed, unmade by contradiction and invitation. It would not return. But its passing left behind an undeniable truth: even stories could become too orderly, too clean. And if the Hollow was to guard against that future, it would need to welcome not just endings, but endings that wandered.

So they built the Garden of Wild Ends.

It wasn’t a garden in the usual sense. There were no rows, no beds, no trimming. No one planted anything intentionally. Instead, visitors came and spoke their unfinished tales aloud—stories with no moral, no structure, no satisfying resolution. The garden would listen. And then, slowly, it would grow.

From each confession sprouted strange flora. One woman told of a brother who vanished mid-song, and from her memory grew a bloom that sang only in storms. A traveling priest wept over a prayer unanswered, and where his tears fell, a vine twisted into the shape of forgotten gods. A child described a dream of a house with no doors, and beneath their feet, a mushroom shaped like a key emerged.

The garden was not for solving. It was for holding. For remembering that incompleteness was not failure—it was real.

Nettle took to walking the garden every morning.

She carried a journal not for recording, but for reminding. Each entry was a moment—half a line, a flicker of thought, a scrap of imagery. Nothing whole. Wholeness, she had learned, was a burden too heavy for any one story to bear alone.

Grack often accompanied her, hopping between misshapen roots and flowers that told half-jokes. “I liked it better when we were fighting dark gods,” he would mutter. “At least then you didn’t stop every five minutes to talk to a tree.”

“You’re not required to come,” she always replied.

“You’d miss me.”

“Probably.”

He was right, though. The peace was not without tension. Quiet invited questions. Stability raised suspicions. But Nettle no longer feared that. Peace, she had realized, was not the absence of problems—it was the presence of space in which to face them without breaking.

Eline became a pathweaver.

She traveled across the continent, visiting border towns, edge-realms, and forgotten villages where stories had stopped being told. She didn’t bring tales with her. She asked questions. And in the asking, people began to remember who they were beyond their roles, beyond their fears.

Corin stayed with the Rootspeaker. She rarely left its side, becoming its translator, guardian, and friend. On her shoulder sat a small bird with no name who chirped only in palindromes. She spoke less now, but her silences were fuller, richer. People came from far away just to sit near her.

Thomlin returned to the marshes for a time. He mapped the forgotten places not with ink, but with absence—drawing blank spaces on charts and labeling them with symbols only he and the land understood. He said nothing more about it, only that some things didn’t need to be found to be known.

And Vey, quiet Vey, now led the teaching of the younger tethers.

He told them no story was sacred. That even legends could bend. That endings could be soft and strange and looping.

That names were doors, and forgetting them was not the same as losing them.

One night, Nettle sat under the Rootspeaker and spoke aloud to no one in particular.

“I think we were wrong to fear the wild stories,” she said. “It wasn’t chaos we were fighting. It was the idea that we couldn’t live without resolution.”

Grack blinked from the branch above.

“So what now? You just let every story go unbuttoned?”

Nettle laughed softly. “Some of them. But not all. Some need closing. Others need to stay open, just wide enough to let something unexpected in.”

She pulled out a small slip of paper and pressed it to the bark.

On it, she had written a single sentence.

This story is not over.

The glyphs above it shimmered a soft violet—hope and dusk combined.

And in the far distance, beneath mountains that hadn’t yet remembered their own names, the world shifted its weight.

Not toward war.

Not toward prophecy.

But toward maybe.

And that, for once, was enough.

The Hollow settled into its new rhythm with the patience of old stones and long winters. It was not stillness—it was balance. Birds did not sing constantly, but when they did, the notes echoed more clearly. The wind no longer howled or whispered; it spoke, when the time was right. The Rootspeaker’s branches widened across the glade, and children began to hang fragments of dreams from its limbs: bits of woven cloth, strands of story-thread, wax-stamped snippets of half-songs and names they hoped to remember someday.

No one told them to. No one told them not to.

The Rootspeaker allowed it, and in doing so, became something more than symbol. It became home.

Nettle, though still called Witch of the Hollow, felt the title soften on her. It no longer carried the edge of old fear, the shadow of isolation. Now, it was almost affectionate—more a way of saying we remember who helped us remember ourselves. She still brewed tea with strange herbs and scribbled thoughts on wall parchment, still walked in circles when thinking too hard, still talked to her books as if they were rowdy pets—but she no longer moved like someone expecting the world to fall apart beneath her feet.

That change was subtle, and it came slowly, the way old habits fracture when new roots grow stronger than the ones they replaced.

Visitors came. Not in waves, not in procession, but like messengers arriving on the breeze. They carried questions instead of quests. They stayed in the Hollow for a few days or weeks, wandering the Garden of Wild Ends or sitting in silence beneath the ash trees, and when they left, they left different—not solved, but held.

One such visitor, an archivist from the Deepward College, arrived in late spring with a knapsack full of lost tomes and a heart full of disbelief.

“This place wasn’t supposed to survive,” she said on her third day. “The records described the Hollow as a cursed perimeter. A place where language decayed and memory couldn’t root.”

“Records,” Nettle replied, sipping from a mug of saltberry tea, “have always been allergic to magic that doesn’t care to explain itself.”

The archivist stayed for a month, left behind two books, and returned home barefoot.

Elsewhere, the world noticed the change in subtler ways. The dreaming-woods in the Western Glade began to produce twin-leaved trees, the kind only seen in old myth. Storythread, once a rare and dangerous spell material, began growing wild in hedgerows. Languages once extinct were spoken fluently in dreams and carried over into waking conversation. People began speaking aloud the questions they had kept hidden in their hearts—and sometimes, they were answered by the land itself.

The Between, though still unreachable to most, became a place of gentle myth rather than danger. The word no longer summoned fear. It summoned curiosity.

And within it, somewhere past the shattered archways of forgotten narrative, a girl still sat—the Last Page, watching the edges of unwritten possibility curl toward light. She smiled more often now, and sometimes the ground bloomed beneath her feet.

Because endings were being rewritten—not just in Thistledown, but everywhere.

One evening, Nettle found Eline standing at the edge of the Rootspeaker grove, holding a story-thread wound tight around a silver key.

“You’re leaving again,” Nettle said.

“I am.”

“Far?”

“Far enough. I’ve heard of a river that remembers every name ever spoken to it. I want to see if it remembers mine.”

Nettle nodded. “Will you come back?”

Eline smiled. “If I don’t, it’s because I’ve become a part of something worth being lost inside.”

They hugged in silence. It was not a farewell. It was just a chapter break.

Later, Vey sat with Thomlin near the garden and read from the Living Archive. The pages no longer shimmered—they pulsed. The ink changed slightly every time they told the same story, not because the story was uncertain, but because living things move.

Corin planted new memory stones beneath the Rootspeaker’s outer ring. She never explained to anyone what they were for, but each bore a single etched phrase:

This is what I chose to keep.

When asked what they meant, she simply replied, “You’ll know when it’s time to place your own.”

On the last day of spring, Nettle stood alone in the center of the glade.

The sun filtered down through the Rootspeaker’s branches, scattering leaflight across the moss. Everything was quiet—not silent, but content. Even Grack was napping, wings drooped over the edge of the roof like melted ink.

She held in her hands a scroll. Not a spell. Not a prophecy. Just a record.

She had begun writing it the day after they unmade the Editor.

Not to remember, she’d said then, but to remember that we can forget without being lost.

She unrolled it now, rereading the first lines.

This story did not end where we thought it would.
It did not collapse, nor did it triumph.
It changed.
And in that change, it invited us to stay.

She added one final sentence.

And in staying, we began again.

She tucked the scroll into a notch in the Rootspeaker’s trunk, where it disappeared with a soft shimmer.

No ceremony. No magic burst. Just a gesture.

Just enough.

And as the day slid into evening and the Hollow settled beneath a sky that no longer cracked, no longer wept, but simply held, Nettle smiled for no one but herself.

The stories were still unfinished.

Good.

They always should be.

Chapter Nine: Echoes in the Tangle

Summer arrived not in a blaze, but in a slow exhale—warm, golden, and rich with scent. The Hollow smelled of earth and blooming barkroot, the kind of summer that clung not only to the skin but to memory. Cicadas buzzed high in the branches, not in repetition but in song, improvising a rhythm that only made sense if you listened crooked. The Garden of Wild Ends exploded with color—some plants that bloomed at dusk, some only when ignored, some that told secrets if you watered them with tea.

It had been many moons since the world bent beneath the weight of gods or voids. And yet, Nettle had not grown complacent. Peace, she had learned, was a plant that bore watchfulness like fruit.

The Rootspeaker now held a ring of benches around it, shaped not by hand but by natural growth. Fungi and fallen limbs, smoothed by time, formed seats that invited contemplation but not permanence. People came, stayed a while, and left when they felt finished, though many returned later, realizing that being finished was a lie most often told to oneself.

One morning, a wind from the western fen brought a letter—folded leaf, sealed with beetle wax. Nettle knew the style. It was from Eline.

She opened it with care, unfolding the leaf to reveal looping script.

    I found the river. It remembers names, yes—but not in words. It remembers feelings.
    When I stood at its edge, it murmured something I had once thought I’d forgotten: the way my mother said my name when I was very small. That exact tone.
    The river can’t lie. It only echoes.
    I’ll stay a while longer. There are others here—wanderers, wayfarers, untethered folk. They’re starting to share stories, even though they’ve never had homes.
    I think they’re building one. I might help.

Nettle read the letter twice before pressing it between the pages of her memorybook, not to keep the message, but to remember the moment. She poured two cups of tea, though no one else was there, and left one steaming beside the Rootspeaker.

“You know,” she said aloud, “some people think stories end when the main character finds peace.”

The Rootspeaker’s leaves turned a shade between lavender and smoke—contemplative.

“But that’s a lie, isn’t it?” she went on. “Peace isn’t the end. It’s the hallway between doors.”

A single leaf fluttered down and landed in her empty cup. She laughed softly.

“I thought so.”

It wasn’t long after that the dreams began again.

Not nightmares, not prophecies, but pulls. People in the Hollow started waking with words in their mouths they didn’t remember learning. Some muttered songs with no melody. Others sketched spirals into the dirt without meaning to. Thomlin found himself staring into puddles for hours, seeing places that shimmered just outside thought.

At first, they believed the Between had begun to shift again. But when Vey slept beneath the Rootspeaker and returned with a name he’d never heard before—“Mirael”—something in Nettle’s bones stirred.

She hadn’t heard that name since the very early days of the Hollow. Mirael had been a flame-whisper, a storm-speaker, one of the first to bend storythread into usable form. She had disappeared when the Hollow was still young, when the first roots were not yet settled, and her name had since passed into silence.

Until now.

Corin found the first anchor.

It was a stone—not large, but warm to the touch, etched with spirals that moved ever so slightly when looked at from the side. Beneath it was a lock of moss braided with storythread. A trace. A breadcrumb. A fragment of someone who had refused to be erased completely.

“I think she buried herself,” Corin said, brushing dirt from her hands. “Not in fear. In promise.”

They followed the signs.

Through the Sighing Stones, where wind always carried questions. Into the Bramble Path, which shifted with every second step. Across the Shard Vale, where broken mirrors sprouted like weeds and only half your reflection looked back.

Each place offered a piece.

A memory, a smell, a word that felt like a heartbeat caught in the throat.

Mirael had scattered herself.

Not to hide.

To protect something.

At the edge of the Hollow’s old boundary—where the oldest map trees grew and the river looped like it had forgotten how to go straight—they found the last thread. Not a lock of hair. Not a page.

A laugh.

Suspended in the air like dew, crystalline and impossible, a perfect moment of delight captured in spell-song. Vey was the one who heard it first. He fell to his knees and wept—not for sorrow, but recognition.

“She never stopped believing the Hollow would need her again,” he whispered.

And Nettle, standing above him with her cloak catching in the breeze, knew what had to be done.

They would reseed her.

Not resurrect. Not summon. Not rewrite.

They would invite her back into the garden.

The ritual took place beneath the Rootspeaker, at dusk, when the air carried that soft hush between light and dark. Not many came—only those who remembered enough to speak her name without fear of binding her. Nettle spoke first, followed by Vey, then Corin, then Thomlin. Each offered not a eulogy, but a thread—a memory of something Mirael had believed.

“She said magic didn’t belong to blood,” Nettle said. “It belonged to choice.”

“She taught me that forgetting is sometimes how we survive,” said Corin.

“She called dreams the map between people,” Vey added. “She said stories were just how we built bridges between one another.”

And then they scattered the memorythread into the soil.

Nothing happened at first.

Then a new bloom unfurled at the Rootspeaker’s base.

Dark violet petals, edges laced with silver. The scent of smoke and honey. And when the wind passed, it carried a sound just barely audible.

Laughter.

Soft.

Familiar.

Home.

They didn’t speak of it again—not formally. Mirael wasn’t a relic, and she wasn’t meant to become a monument. She had returned, not in flesh, not even in spirit, but in presence. Her beliefs had found soil again.

From that day on, the Hollow changed in subtle ways. People began naming the flowers that grew from shared stories. The garden became less curated, more chaotic—but it thrived. The Rootspeaker’s canopy extended just a little farther each week. And the dreams? They became layered, not confusing, but tangled, like roots that met and wrapped together, choosing not to grow apart.

One day, Nettle found a child sitting near the new bloom, whispering her own name into the wind.

When asked why, the girl replied, “Because I want to be remembered the way she is.”

Nettle smiled and nodded.

“We all do,” she said. “Now and then.”

That same summer, as heat deepened and the days lingered into golden hours where time felt unanchored, more children began wandering into the Garden of Wild Ends. Not just from Thistledown Hollow, but from further beyond—villages where language still had hard edges, where dreams were discouraged, where magic was spoken of only in the past tense. They arrived without ceremony, usually alone, carrying a story with them that they didn’t know how to tell.

The Hollow welcomed them the way it welcomed all stories: not with questions, but with space.

One girl named Lira came with no shoes, her arms covered in faded chalk glyphs. She said nothing for a week. Then, one evening, she took a stone from the garden and drew a spiral on the trunk of the Rootspeaker. When Nettle asked her what it meant, she replied simply, “This is how I remember not to be forgotten.”

Another child, Rilo, brought a pouch of pebbles and dropped one each morning into the stream that ran through the northern glade. “Each one’s a secret,” he explained. “When the water smooths them enough, I’ll come back and remember them properly.”

These weren’t spells. They weren’t rites. They were choices—rituals of personal meaning. And the Rootspeaker responded not with words, but with resonance. Its leaves vibrated ever so slightly when certain children approached. Sometimes, it dropped fruit no one had ever seen before, with skin like velvet and cores filled with storydust—powder that made people recall dreams they'd never had but somehow missed.

Nettle began to wonder if the Hollow was becoming something more than a place.

Something alive in a larger way.

Not sentient like a being. But aware like a tide.

That idea solidified one evening when Corin returned from her walk along the outer trails, face drawn, hands shaking slightly. She carried a handful of crumbling paper, wind-worn and scattered with ink that no longer held legible letters.

“I found this caught in the bramble weave,” she said, spreading the scraps out on the table inside Nettle’s cottage. “It’s not just from our side.”

Nettle studied the fragments. The ink shimmered faintly in a hue that didn’t belong to their world’s palette.

“Between-born,” she whispered. “From within the old seams.”

“I think the Between is leaking,” Corin said. “But not breaking. It’s... sharing.”

The implication was staggering.

The Between had always been a place of change, of reshaping, of raw potential. But it had required crossing. Effort. Permission. Now, it was reaching through—pressing gently into the real, not to conquer or consume, but to intertwine.

“This is what happens when you don’t contain wildness,” Nettle murmured. “It becomes part of the landscape.”

They didn’t send out a call. They didn’t announce it. But word spread all the same: the Hollow was a threshold now.

Not just to the Between.

But to the unspoken, the not-yet-named, the not-quite-possible.

And people came.

Not seeking answers, but seeking room to ask better questions.

One day, Thomlin brought back a traveler from the salt coast—an elderly man with eyes like dusk and a voice that sounded like it was waiting for silence. He claimed to be a memory keeper from a ruined temple that had worshipped stories as gods. Not in metaphor. Literally.

“Our stories began to demand,” he said as he sat by the Rootspeaker, fingers combing the moss. “They wanted tribute. They became hungry.”

“And what did you do?” Nettle asked.

He looked at her sadly. “We obeyed. Until we realized they were only mirrors for our own fear. Stories don’t consume us unless we forget we can change them.”

He left the next morning, but not before pressing a ring of woven paper into Nettle’s hand.

“For when the Hollow forgets itself.”

She didn’t know what to do with it yet, so she planted it in the Garden of Wild Ends.

That evening, a single shoot sprouted.

The Rootspeaker, meanwhile, continued its quiet evolution.

Its leaves had become bilingual, if such a thing could be said of flora. Some bore glyphs from the old Between tongue; others curled with markings that resembled songs—wave-etched forms that sang when touched. Children called them “whisper leaves,” and they began a game of learning to read them with their hands rather than eyes.

Even Grack got caught up in it. He began stealing dropped leaves and arranging them in the shape of poems, though he denied it furiously whenever anyone caught him.

“I’m no bard,” he muttered once. “Just bored.”

But Nettle noticed the way he lingered near the sapling that had bloomed from Mirael’s memory, the way he sometimes hummed to it without realizing.

The Hollow was no longer merely recovering.

It was remembering forward.

That night, Nettle dreamt of the Hollow as a map. Not drawn, but grown.

Each root was a path. Each bloom, a decision. Each memory, a seed pressed into future soil.

She saw herself walking between dreams, leaving handprints on trees that whispered in mirror-voice. She saw Eline laughing at the edge of a continent that hadn’t existed yesterday. She saw children building lanterns from unanswered questions and floating them skyward, not for resolution, but for resonance.

When she woke, she walked to the Rootspeaker barefoot, still carrying the warmth of sleep.

“Is this what we were building all along?” she asked, voice thin with awe.

A wind rustled the branches.

No words.

Just sound.

Like something smiling through leaves.

Like yes.

Or maybe more.

And she understood.

The Hollow was no longer simply a refuge from the world’s endings.

It had become a place where beginnings could be left unclaimed, allowed to wander until someone was ready to follow them home.

The signs of the Hollow’s transformation continued, not in grand miracles, but in the fine, careful threading of the everyday. A mushroom appeared that only bloomed in the presence of contradiction. A root system beneath the eastern rocks began growing in spirals that matched the cadence of lullabies whispered nearby. Stories whispered into cups of tea left a faint aftertaste of memory not your own. And no one—not even the oldest residents—found any of it unusual.

This, perhaps, was the greatest change. Not that the Hollow had become wondrous, but that wonder no longer needed to explain itself.

In the middle of the Garden, a tree began growing—not planted by hand, nor seed, but from shared memory. Children had begun gathering around a certain patch of soil where they would tell their dreams, hopes, fears, half-invented tales about future selves and possible worlds. One night, a sprout pushed through the moss, and by morning, it had become a sapling. No one took credit. It wasn’t claimed or named. But it grew, slowly, steadily, fed by collective imagining.

The Rootspeaker did not oppose it. In fact, its glyphs glowed softly every time the sapling grew a new branch.

“They’re not in competition,” Corin observed one day, sitting beside Nettle on the outer bench. “They’re in conversation.”

Nettle glanced over, noticing the harmony of their shapes—one old, broad, glowing with lived memory; the other thin, angular, still reaching. She nodded. “Past and future. Root and branch. Question and echo.”

Grack fluttered down beside them, dropping a beetle he’d been inspecting onto a stone. “One of these trees is going to end up telling stories about the other. You know that, right?”

“Maybe that’s the point,” Nettle said. “That they’ll take turns.”

Vey began organizing what he called “Memory Walks”—rituals of movement rather than speech. Once a week, he would lead a group of anyone willing to walk the Hollow in silence, eyes open, feet slow, collecting impressions rather than facts. Participants weren’t asked to report what they saw. Instead, they left behind something of their own—a thread tied to a branch, a word buried under a rock, a question spoken into the bark of a tree.

Over time, the Hollow responded.

Paths began to curve gently around places where stories had lingered. Trees grew with intentional knots, places to rest a head or place a hand. A set of stepping stones arranged themselves across the creek, though no one admitted to having placed them. The land was listening, not with ears, but with attention.

And in return, people began to notice not only the Hollow—but each other.

One morning, a child asked Nettle why there were no maps of the garden paths.

She smiled. “Because if you know where you’re going, you miss what you didn’t know to look for.”

The child nodded as if that made perfect sense and skipped away humming a tune that no adult could quite remember afterward.

Later that month, a man arrived from the eastern gate. He carried a long staff wrapped in ribbons and a satchel filled with unopened letters. He had no name he cared to give, but he introduced himself with a question:

“What story are you willing to forget in order to become someone new?”

The question unsettled some. But in the Hollow, it was met with curiosity.

He stayed for nine days. Never in one place, always moving, always listening. He left behind a folded piece of paper at the Rootspeaker’s base. When opened, it simply read:

Truth is a question we have to keep asking differently.

No one saw him go.

But afterward, the Garden grew a flower that bloomed only when no one was looking directly at it.

One early morning, Nettle found herself sitting alone beneath the Rootspeaker, tea gone cold in her hands. The sun had barely crested the treetops, and a thin mist lingered, curling gently over roots and stone. She wasn’t thinking of any one thing. It was more like her mind had become a field, and thoughts drifted through it without needing to land.

Then, softly, she heard someone approach.

Vey.

He sat beside her without speaking, legs drawn up, watching the leaves sway in the still air.

After a while, he said, “Do you think we’re still needed?”

Nettle turned her head. “What do you mean?”

“The Hollow doesn’t need protecting anymore. Not in the way it used to. People come, and it holds them. The Rootspeaker knows more now than I ever will. The Between has quieted. Even the dreams… they’re no longer warnings. Just invitations.”

Nettle sipped the last of her tea, bitter now with coolness. “Maybe being needed isn’t the point anymore.”

Vey didn’t answer.

She continued, “We started this story thinking we had to stop something. Then we thought we had to shape something. Now I think… maybe we’re just meant to be part of something.”

“Like roots in the dirt.”

“Like breath in a body. Like punctuation in a sentence that doesn’t want to end.”

Vey exhaled, a slow, thoughtful sound. “I think I can live with that.”

That night, for the first time in months, Nettle dreamed of Dreldein.

But not as a threat.

She stood in the field of the Between, where storylight used to flicker like lanterns in fog. He sat on a bench made of memory, hands empty, watching something invisible move across the air like smoke.

“I thought you were gone,” she said.

“I am,” he replied.

“Then why are you here?”

“Because stories remember even what they let go.”

She looked at his face—not cruel now, not hollow. Just tired.

“What are you watching?” she asked.

“New stories,” he said. “Ones I never had the patience to leave unfinished.”

She sat beside him.

“You don’t get to shape them anymore,” she said.

“I know,” he said, and for once, he didn’t sound angry. “But it’s enough to watch.”

When she woke, she wept—not out of grief, but relief.

The story that once tried to devour all others had finally learned to listen.

And in doing so, had become just another name in the garden.

Chapter Ten: Where the Stories Sleep

Late summer in the Hollow was a kind of slow symphony. Everything moved softer. Bees drifted rather than flew. Leaves whispered in longer syllables. Even the creek’s rush had relaxed into a kind of humming lullaby, as if it had run far enough and now simply wanted to stay near. The Garden of Wild Ends was blooming in contradiction—some flowers shriveled as they matured, others unfolded only when spoken to in forgotten dialects. There were vines that told jokes if touched in the right order, and mushrooms that glowed softly when you lied near them, as though illuminating the space dishonesty leaves behind.

And the people?

They were quieter too—not silenced, but settled.

Something in the Hollow had shifted again—not dramatically, not like in the days of Dreldein or the Editor, but deeper. Like a sigh released after years of held breath. It wasn't the kind of peace one declared, but the kind one discovered already blooming beneath your ribs.

Nettle noticed it first in how rarely anyone asked what things meant anymore.

Visitors still came, and always would, but fewer demanded explanations. The Hollow wasn’t there to provide certainty—it was there to hold the unanswered long enough that people stopped needing the answer at all.

One morning, a young woman named Seret approached Nettle near the Rootspeaker, her hands stained with ink and her hair full of twigs. “I wrote a book,” she said. “But the ending won’t settle. It changes every time I reread it.”

Nettle gestured for her to sit. “Then maybe that’s what it’s meant to do.”

“But how can it mean anything if it doesn’t decide something?”

Nettle took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Some stories don’t teach. Some stories stay with you. Like dreams. Or songs you don’t understand until years later.”

Seret frowned, but she didn’t argue. She buried her book beneath one of the memory stones and walked away whistling a tune she hadn’t remembered knowing.

Later that evening, the Rootspeaker dropped a single seed at Nettle’s feet. It pulsed faintly, not with light, but with remembrance. When she touched it, a story flickered behind her eyes—a half-told tale of a boy made of fog who spent his life building stairs to nowhere.

She planted it beneath the glowvine and didn’t speak of it again.

By now, the Hollow had no map, no borders anyone could agree on. Paths appeared, vanished, reappeared somewhere else. Stones rearranged themselves to mark decisions made in silence. A tree began growing upside down, its roots curling into the sky like curious fingers. No one knew why. No one tried to stop it.

It was accepted.

One day, Grack came flapping furiously into Nettle’s workshop, feathers askew, eyes wide.

“It’s speaking,” he cawed. “Not in words, but it’s speaking.”

She followed him to the edge of the Garden where a thicket of threadvine had grown into a kind of cocoon, its fibers trembling with song.

Inside was a man.

Or something once a man.

His skin was etched with lines like bark, his fingers long, as though meant to turn pages that didn’t exist yet. His eyes were closed, but his mouth moved in time with the trembling vines.

They didn’t touch him. Didn’t wake him.

They listened.

His whispers were not a story.

They were the story of dreaming itself.

He told of trees that remembered being stars. Of laughter older than gravity. Of a place where language hadn’t learned to divide yet, where everything could still be everything else.

When he finished, the vines unraveled and the figure vanished like mist in sunlight.

Grack blinked. “Well. That’s new.”

Nettle only smiled. “No, old friend. That’s the oldest thing we’ve ever heard.”

Toward the end of the season, a child who had never spoken before took a brush and painted a doorway on the side of a tree. No one taught her how. No one knew where the paint had come from. But the doorway shimmered for three days.

Some said it led to a world made of questions. Others claimed to have heard voices from it asking things like, Who are you when no one needs you? and What do you leave behind when you don’t leave?

No one stepped through.

That felt important.

By the fourth day, the tree grew new bark over the doorway, slow and smooth, like a blanket being tucked gently over a sleeping child.

Nettle began dreaming of the sea again—not the real sea, but the one her grandmother used to speak of in riddles: a sea with no water, only memory. A place where waves crashed not on shores, but on ideas left incomplete.

In her dreams, the sea whispered the names of stories that had yet to be told.

And she woke, always, with one word in her mouth: soon.

She wrote it on a slip of paper and tucked it into the hollow of the Rootspeaker, next to the scroll she’d left long ago.

That night, the wind carried her dreams to the children, who sang them in their sleep.

Then, without warning, it rained.

Not water.

Pages.

Thousands of them.

Falling from the sky in spirals, blank and weatherless, soft as moth wings. No message. No mark.

Some caught in the trees. Some melted on contact. Some landed and remained, curling into themselves as though waiting to be written.

The Hollow paused.

Held its breath.

And then went back to being itself.

Nettle gathered a handful of the pages and placed them beneath the sapling beside the Rootspeaker. “For whatever’s next,” she said.

No one asked where the pages came from.

Everyone agreed they had been waiting for them.

Nettle noticed, in the weeks after the page-rain, that the Hollow had developed a hush—not a silence, but a low, constant stillness, like breath held in anticipation. The kind of stillness found just before dawn, when the world is awake but not yet moving. It wasn’t unsettling. It felt like the Hollow had paused—not to rest, but to listen.

People continued their lives, but differently. More attentively. A potter from the south spent three days sculpting a bowl from ashclay, then smashed it deliberately and whispered to the pieces before burying them. A boy began collecting laughter in small bottles, corking each one and hiding them throughout the glade. A woman spent seven sunsets writing a poem that could only be read if the reader walked backwards while reciting it aloud.

No one questioned these things.

In fact, they became contagious.

The Hollow no longer offered clarity. It offered permission. To unravel. To explore. To contradict yourself and not apologize. Every leaf on the Rootspeaker seemed to glow faintly, not in brightness but in mood. If you stood beneath it long enough, you often forgot what question you’d come to ask—only to realize you’d never needed an answer to begin with.

Vey had grown quiet. Not withdrawn, but interior. He’d begun speaking in riddles, not to confuse, but because he no longer believed meaning had to be linear. “Words are trails now,” he told Nettle one afternoon, while balancing four smooth stones on his knuckles. “Some lead away. Some bring you right back to the beginning.”

She watched him work, then placed a fifth stone atop his little tower. “And some make a circle.”

He nodded. “Or a nest.”

They left the stones where they lay, and by morning, moss had grown around them in the shape of a spiral. Someone later painted a memory onto that moss, a story about two sisters who traded shadows and learned to sleep in each other’s dreams.

It stayed there. Unclaimed. Unexplained.

It didn’t need to be more than it was.

One dusk, the Hollow held a gathering—not announced, not organized. It simply happened. People drifted into the clearing near the Rootspeaker with blankets and cups, with songs on their breath and stories on their palms. They came not to perform, but to share, each person unspooling something they had carried too long: a broken ritual, a secret name, a line of poetry they were afraid to finish.

Nettle stood near the edge, listening. Corin beside her. Grack perched on a lantern post, preening but alert.

“Do you remember,” Corin asked, “what it was like before any of this began? Before the Rootspeaker, before the Between opened to us, before anyone came?”

Nettle thought a moment. “I remember feeling like magic was something you survived. Now it feels like something you can become.”

Corin nodded. “I like what we became.”

“So do I.”

The Rootspeaker’s canopy rustled softly in agreement.

When it was Nettle’s turn to speak, she walked into the center of the glade and said nothing at first. Just looked around at the faces—weathered and young, wide-eyed and weary, familiar and strange.

“I once thought a story was only worth telling if it had an end,” she said. “But I’ve learned that endings are just places where a story chooses to rest for a while.”

She let that settle. Then added, “This story—ours—it hasn’t ended. It’s resting. And in that rest, it’s dreaming.”

Someone in the back clapped. Another laughed, then quickly hushed themselves. The crowd relaxed into warmth. Not euphoria, but ease. Like a circle that didn’t need to close to feel whole.

The next morning, a new structure stood in the garden.

Not a building. Not quite.

More like a frame—four posts made of driftwood, roofless, wall-less, with ribbons of storythread stretched between them. It hummed faintly, like a memory tuning itself.

A note had been left nearby.

For those who need a beginning but don’t yet have a shape.

People began using it the way you might use a mirror you don’t expect to understand. Some left offerings: half-drawn maps, old names, unfinished confessions. Others simply sat inside it and waited for the echo of themselves to return.

Nettle visited it once and left a single word tied to one of the threads:

“Still.”

She didn’t expect a response.

But three days later, the word had been gently rewritten beneath her original in handwriting she didn’t recognize:

“Becoming.”

Autumn’s breath came slowly.

The first chill did not announce itself with frost but with memory—certain trees began to hum older songs, and the stream’s laughter deepened. Leaves shifted color as they always had, but now the hues corresponded to emotion, not season. Crimson meant memory reclaimed. Amber meant a story forgiven. Violet meant you had stopped waiting for someone to return, but you loved them still.

The Rootspeaker began shedding pages again—not leaves, this time, but full paragraphs. Story-fragments, handwritten and soft-edged, fell like petals. People gathered them without greed, passing them around like pieces of shared breath.

No one ever collected more than one.

To hold one was enough.

And Nettle?

She began writing again.

Not spells. Not charms. Not protections.

Just pages.

Not for anyone else. Not to preserve or predict or warn.

Just to keep something moving.

She kept them tied in a bundle on her table, loose and wrinkled from time and tea spills. When asked what they were, she said, “Things I don’t want to forget. Even if I do.”

Sometimes she read them aloud to the Rootspeaker.

Sometimes she burned them in the garden.

Both felt like love.

One night, she found herself awake long past dark, the Hollow bathed in silver shadow and breeze.

She wandered to the Rootspeaker, where a child was sleeping with their head in the crook of a root, hands still clutching a piece of blank page. Nettle sat nearby and stared at the sky.

There were no stars that night.

Only the wide quiet.

And in it, she whispered:

“This story is still dreaming.”

The tree stirred.

A leaf fell.

Not in ending.

But in invitation.
