Chapter One: The Shadow in the Orchard

My father used to speak of his brother only in slivers, as if the memories were too sharp to hold all at once. He would sit on the back porch when the sun dipped low and turned the apple orchard gold, the trees casting long lines of shadow like bars across the lawn. He’d light his pipe but often forget to smoke it, and then he’d say:

“You know, your uncle Eli could catch a fish with just his hands. Like some sort of river spirit.”

Then he’d stare off toward the treeline as if waiting for someone to emerge. But no one ever did.

It wasn’t until after he died that I realized I didn’t know whether Eli was alive or not.

My name is Silas Ward. I’m twenty-seven, a stonemason by trade, and I came back to the family farmhouse in Wren Hollow, Vermont, three weeks after my father passed, summoned by a voicemail from the lawyer who handled his will.

“He’s left you something unusual,” the man had said. “You’ll want to come in person.”

So I came, not knowing what to expect, not expecting much. My father had always been a man of silence, the kind who carried pain like a relic in his chest, untouched but precious. Our relationship was measured in working hours and nods, a language of few words and many pauses. I’d left at eighteen and hadn’t returned until the funeral.

Now the house stood quiet, paint peeling in soft curls from the windowsills, the orchard overgrown but still bearing sour fruit. There was something timeless about the place, like it had been waiting for something—or someone.

I met the lawyer, Elias Lark, in the parlor. A tall, skeletal man with thin silver-rimmed glasses and a cough that rattled in his throat like loose change.

“He left you this,” Elias said, handing me a wooden box. Cedar, with a latch that had nearly rusted shut. “And a letter. I advise you read it before anything else.”

Inside the box were four items: an old photograph of two boys standing in front of the orchard—one clearly my father, the other smiling like he knew a secret—a faded map of the local area with strange symbols drawn in red ink, a silver key, and a black stone, smooth and flat like a river rock but warm to the touch.

The letter was short, written in my father’s jagged hand.

Silas,

I tried to forget him. God knows I tried. But the past doesn’t lie still, not in this house.

If you’re reading this, you’re old enough to understand.

Find Eli. He’s still out there. I know it. He never really left.

Follow the map. Use the key. Don’t trust what you see.

-R.W.

The key was the size of my palm, old and heavy, the teeth oddly shaped—too angular for any door I could imagine. It left a faint metallic scent on my fingers, not iron or brass, something older, something more like blood.

I spent the night in my childhood room, the one with the sloped ceiling and the scratched desk. The wallpaper still peeled in the corners. That night I dreamed of a boy in the orchard, digging with his hands. Not digging for something—digging to something.

The next morning, I walked the land with the map. Most of the markings matched local landmarks: the well house, the split oak, the creek that curved around the back of the orchard. But one mark stood out—drawn not on land but beyond it, on a patch that was just blank space.

There was a note scrawled beside it: “Hollow Tree. ¼ mile north of split oak. Only opens after dusk.”

I waited until the sun began to sink, then followed the path through the orchard. The trees seemed to lean closer the deeper I went. The split oak had grown since I last saw it—two trunks from one base, its bark like wrinkled skin.

Past it, the ground changed. The soft hush of grass gave way to damp moss and roots that curled like fingers. I nearly missed the tree—a massive, gnarled thing with a hollow trunk wide enough for a man to slip through.

The key fit into a rusted iron fixture hidden behind a flap of bark. When I turned it, something clicked deep inside the tree.

The air changed.

I stepped into the hollow, expecting the back of the tree. Instead, I stepped out again—into a different orchard.

Same trees, same hill, but the sky was wrong—too red, like a fire just beyond the horizon. And there were no birds. No wind. Just silence.

A figure stood by the treeline, tall and lean, with a hat pulled low.

“Silas,” he said. “You took your time.”

I didn’t answer at first. My throat was dry.

“Eli?”

He smiled. It was the same smile from the photo.

“More or less.”

That was when I realized I hadn’t crossed into a hidden part of the land.

I’d crossed into somewhere else entirely.

Chapter Two: The Red Orchard

The place beyond the hollow tree was a mirror with its colors reversed. The trees bore no fruit, only dark leaves that whispered in a wind I couldn’t feel. The ground was soft and too warm, like skin. I followed Eli—if that’s who he was—through the orchard in silence.

“You’re wondering where we are,” he said eventually.

I nodded.

“It doesn’t have a name,” he said. “Not one you’d understand. It’s old. Older than towns, older than maps.”

“How did you—how did he lose you?”

Eli glanced at me, his eyes catching a flicker of red light. “He didn’t. He gave me up.”

I stopped walking.

“That’s not true.”

Eli tilted his head, birdlike. “Isn’t it? Ask yourself why he never told you. Why he never came looking.”

“He left a map.”

“Now,” Eli said. “But not when it mattered.”

I didn’t know how to argue with that.

He led me to a clearing where the trees opened in a perfect circle. At its center was a stone table, smooth and black, not unlike the one in the box.

“This is what it’s all about,” Eli said, touching the stone with reverence. “This is where they chose.”

“Chose what?”

“Who stays. Who goes. Who remembers.”

There was something written on the stone in a script that shimmered and shifted. My eyes couldn’t hold it; the words slipped away every time I tried to fix them in place.

“You were meant to come sooner,” Eli said. “But time doesn’t move here the same.”

He looked older than in the photo—much older than he should have been.

“You’ve been trapped here?”

“Not trapped. Bound. There’s a difference.”

I felt the weight of the key in my pocket.

“And you want me to free you.”

“No,” Eli said. “I want you to take my place.”

The silence in that orchard was not the kind of silence you find in the early morning, nor the hush before a storm. It was the kind of silence that pressed against your skin, that got into your ears and dulled your heartbeat. I followed Eli, if he was indeed Eli, through the strange mirror of my childhood orchard, trying not to look too long at the trees. Their bark writhed subtly, and some of the trunks appeared to have faces pressed into them, as if the trees had swallowed people long ago and the imprint of their final moments had been frozen in wood.

Eli walked with an easy grace, but his boots didn’t make a sound on the earth. That unsettled me more than anything. When I stepped, leaves crunched and twigs snapped beneath me. But when he walked, there was nothing. No echo, no weight. Just movement.

He led me past a row of trees that had been hollowed out. Inside each cavity, something shimmered faintly—images, maybe, or memories. I caught one glimpse of my father, younger than I’d ever seen him, sitting beside a river with a boy I now understood to be Eli. They laughed together, splashing water, oblivious to the watching world. But the vision faded as I passed, and when I looked back, there was only blackness.

“Why are you showing me this?” I asked, my voice sounding damp in the heavy air.

“Because this place is made of memory,” Eli said, not turning. “And memories rot, if they’re not tended to.”

At the edge of the orchard stood a house that hadn’t been there before. It resembled the farmhouse back home but in the way a dream resembles the real world—similar in structure but wrong in proportion. The shutters hung at odd angles. The door was too tall, the porch too wide. A faint light glowed in the upper window.

“You remember it like this,” Eli said. “That’s why it looks this way.”

I stopped at the porch steps. “Is this your doing?”

He shook his head. “This place listens. It builds from what’s inside you. I’ve tried to change it, but it’s stubborn. It wants truth.”

I hesitated, but Eli gestured for me to follow, and I did. The floorboards creaked under me but not under him. Inside, the house was furnished with pieces from my past—a green corduroy couch we’d thrown out when I was twelve, the cuckoo clock my father had smashed in a fit of anger one winter, the table with the burn marks from when Eli—if the stories were true—had left a lantern too close to the wood.

Everything was dusty, as though it had been waiting a long time.

Eli sat across from me in the living room, long legs folded beneath him, fingers steepled like he was about to give a sermon. I had a thousand questions, but they choked in my throat. All I could manage was, “How long have you been here?”

He tilted his head, considering. “Time is… different here. I think it’s been years for you. For me, it’s felt like a lifetime.”

“What is this place, really?”

He hesitated before answering. “It’s where things that aren’t supposed to exist… end up. Where people go when they’re forgotten but not gone. A place outside of time, outside of death.”

“You died?”

“I changed.”

That wasn’t an answer, not really. But in that moment, I believed him. His skin was pale but not sickly. His eyes held no madness. There was sadness, yes. And something sharper—regret, maybe. Or guilt.

He looked at the stone I’d placed on the table between us. “That was mine once. You brought it back.”

“I don’t know what it is.”

“It’s a seed,” he said. “From the first orchard. The one that came before this world.”

I blinked. “You’re not making any sense.”

“I know.” His voice was kind, almost apologetic. “But you will understand. There are things your father never told you. He was trying to protect you. And me. But he was too late. He made a choice. He let me stay here, because he couldn’t face what I’d become.”

I opened my mouth, but he raised a hand.

“Let me finish. You’ll want to interrupt. Everyone does, the first time.”

So I sat back. The house creaked around us. Shadows shifted on the walls even though no fire burned.

“I was thirteen the day it happened,” Eli began. “We were down by the creek. Your father and I used to pretend we were explorers, like in those old dime novels he liked. We found something—something buried in the riverbed. It looked like a stone at first, but when I touched it, I heard a voice in my head. Not words, just… a hum. Like the inside of a bell.”

He paused, eyes going distant.

“Your father told me to leave it, but I kept going back. Every night, I’d sneak out, dig deeper. Eventually I found more than the stone. I found the gate.”

“Gate?”

“There are places in the world where reality thins. Weak spots. Cracks. That was one of them. I opened it. I stepped through. And I didn’t come back the same.”

The air grew colder. I could see my breath now, curling like smoke.

“You brought something back,” I said, though I didn’t mean to say it aloud.

He nodded.

“It wasn’t evil,” he said. “Not in the way people think. It was old. Hungry. It wanted a home. I became that home.”

My mouth went dry. “What happened?”

“Your father tried to save me. But he didn’t understand the rules. He thought sealing the gate would stop it. All he did was trap me here. Half in, half out.”

“And the map?”

“He kept watch. He wanted to fix what he broke. But he didn’t believe I was still me. And maybe I wasn’t.”

I stood up, not sure what to do with my limbs. “Why bring me here?”

Eli rose too, slowly. “Because the gate’s weakening again. This place doesn’t hold as well as it used to. And you have something I need.”

I backed away, one step.

“Don’t be afraid,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt you. I just want to be free.”

“How?” I asked.

He pointed to the black stone. “Plant it.”

I frowned. “Where?”

“Here. In the orchard. It will grow. It will open the gate wide enough for me to pass.”

“What happens if I do?”

His eyes darkened. “The world changes. Maybe not all at once. But over time, this place and your world… they’ll merge. Become one.”

“And if I don’t?”

He looked genuinely sad.

“Then I stay. And something worse finds its way through.”

The ground trembled beneath our feet.

“I didn’t come here to make this choice,” I whispered.

“No one ever does,” Eli said. “But here you are.”

A groan echoed through the walls of the strange house as though the timbers themselves had heard Eli’s words and were objecting. Dust sifted down from the rafters in a fine mist. Somewhere upstairs, something heavy shifted, like a piece of furniture dragging across the floor, though neither of us moved.

I gritted my teeth and took a step back from him, my hand inching toward the pocket where the silver key sat like a hidden blade. Eli noticed, of course he did. He’d always been the quicker one, the watcher, the listener. When we were kids—if that memory had any basis in truth—he was the one who could sneak out and back in without a creak of the stairs. He saw the twitch in my hand and smiled, thin and tight.

“You think the key will protect you?” he asked.

I didn’t answer. Instead, I kept my eyes locked on his and let the silence stretch between us, trying to read his intentions the way my father used to read clouds—looking for signs of storm.

He sighed and turned away, walking to the cracked window. Outside, the orchard’s trees pulsed ever so slightly, their branches twitching in rhythm, not with the wind—there was none—but with something deeper, like a heartbeat buried in the soil. I realized that I hadn’t heard a bird, or a squirrel, or even an insect since I stepped through the hollow tree.

“I don’t want to lie to you,” Eli said after a while. “I’ve done enough of that. There is no good choice here. Only the one that hurts less.”

“You don’t even know what will come through if I plant it.”

“No,” he agreed, turning back to me. “But I know what will happen if it’s left here. It won’t stay dormant. Eventually, it’ll grow anyway. Without roots, without shape. It’ll feed off the memories here until it tears a hole too wide to mend.”

“And the real world?”

He gave a slow shake of his head. “It won’t be real for long.”

The wind picked up outside, finally, but it wasn’t the wind of home. It was thick, wheezing, carrying the scent of wet ash and something worse—something sour, like old blood on rusted iron.

“Your father knew all this?” I asked, suddenly cold down to my bones.

“He knew enough. Enough to be afraid of it. Enough to try to lock it away.”

“Then why did he leave me the map?”

“Because he believed in you.” Eli’s face softened. “Even after he’d given up on me. He hoped you’d find another way. He always thought you were stronger.”

A hollow laugh escaped me, bitter and sharp. “I’m just a mason. I fix walls. I don’t open gates. I don’t plant ancient seeds from other realities.”

Eli looked down, his voice low. “Maybe that’s exactly why it has to be you. Because you don’t want it.”

There was a crack behind us—loud and final. The back door of the house, the one I hadn’t even noticed until now, split down the center, and through the gap seeped a creeping mist. It rolled in low, slithering over the floor like fog across ice. In its wake, the wood warped and blackened.

Eli’s expression changed. For the first time, he looked afraid.

“We’re out of time.”

“What is that?” I asked, backing away as the mist inched toward my boots.

“The others,” he said. “The ones that stay in the cracks. They smell the stone. They know you brought it here.”

He snatched the black seed-stone from the table and thrust it back into my hands. It burned, not with heat, but with a kind of weight that dragged down the tendons in my wrist.

“Run,” he said.

“But—”

“GO!”

I turned and bolted through the front door, flinging it open so hard it cracked against the wall. The orchard outside was darker now, the trees closer, almost choking the path. I didn’t look back. Behind me I heard the door splinter, and something scream—a sound like metal scraping against teeth.

The ground writhed beneath me. Roots lashed at my boots. I tripped once, rolled, came up scraped and breathless, but I didn’t stop. My legs moved on their own, driven by the primal instinct that comes when all other options vanish.

The hollow tree came into view, the trunk yawning wide like a mouth waiting to swallow me whole. I could see the shimmer of my world on the other side—a haze of pale gold and fading sunlight.

I lunged through.

For a moment, I felt pulled in two directions—one foot in each world, my body stretching like taffy. The orchard behind me moaned, a chorus of rustling leaves and things that should not breathe. Then the key, still in my pocket, flared hot. I clutched it through the fabric, and suddenly I was through.

I collapsed just outside the tree in the real orchard, gasping on my hands and knees. The sky was still the blue of twilight. Birds chirped, distant and faint. The scent of apples—real, sour, overripe—hit my nose.

I was back.

I lay there for a long while, my fingers digging into the dirt just to remind myself it was solid. Real. I heard the wind move through the leaves, and it didn’t speak. It just rustled.

When I finally got to my feet, I didn’t look back at the tree. I walked toward the farmhouse on shaky legs, not bothering to brush the dirt from my clothes. My mind churned, but no clear thoughts came. Just pieces—Eli’s face, the sound of the mist slithering, the weight of the stone in my palm.

That night, I buried the black seed under the floorboards in the cellar. I wrapped it in burlap and salt and locked it in a wooden box with iron nails driven into every corner. I didn’t know if that would be enough. But it was something.

For the next week, I stayed in the house. I didn’t go back to the orchard. I didn’t answer my phone. I sat in my father’s chair on the porch and smoked a pipe I didn’t like and watched the horizon for signs of red.

Nothing came. But nothing felt the same, either.

Sometimes, at night, I heard footsteps upstairs where no one lived. And once, just before sleep took me, I thought I heard a voice whisper through the vent beside my bed.

It said, “You’ll have to choose again.”

But I didn’t respond. I rolled over, closed my eyes, and dreamed of roots reaching through the floor, looking for the box.

Chapter Two: A Silence Between Seasons

The first true snowfall came late that year. October turned over into November with bare branches and a dry wind that rattled the shutters on the house each night like the knuckles of a man too long dead to knock properly. When the snow finally did arrive, it came quietly, without storm or thunder, just a gentle layering of white that softened the world outside into something that looked almost peaceful—if not for the way the orchard refused to wear it. Every tree on the far side of the split oak remained dry, untouched, the snow melting as soon as it landed on the branches. It left a dark swath in the orchard’s heart, a strip of land that seemed to breathe against the cold.

I stayed indoors as much as I could. The farmhouse was no warmer than a refrigerator even with the wood stove burning through cords I’d stacked earlier in the month, but the cold in the house didn’t bite like the cold outside. That cold had weight, and when I stood too long on the porch, I could feel something in it watching. Something that remembered me.

My days fell into rhythmless hours. I repaired what needed repair, mostly to distract my hands—recaulked windows, oiled hinges, replaced three steps on the back porch that had turned brittle. The cellar remained locked. I didn’t go down. Not since I’d buried the seed beneath the packed earth floor and covered it with iron and salt. But sometimes, I’d feel a thrum beneath my feet when I passed over it, like a heartbeat, too faint to hear but impossible to ignore.

I started keeping a journal. It felt like something my father would have done, though I never found any journals of his, only loose notes and the map, carefully folded and now hidden inside an envelope tucked behind a kitchen cabinet. I filled the first pages with what had happened—everything I could remember from the hollow tree to the orchard-that-wasn’t. I wrote Eli’s words down, over and over, trying to see if their meaning changed depending on how I arranged them.

"He gave me up."
"It’s where things that aren’t supposed to exist… end up."
"Don’t trust what you see."

Each phrase felt like the beginning of something much older than the day I stepped through the hollow tree.

On the eleventh night after my return, I was woken by a knock—not at the door, but from beneath the floorboards. Three short raps. Deliberate. Close. I sat upright, heart hammering, eyes straining in the dark for shapes that didn’t belong. The knock didn’t come again. I didn’t go down. I waited until morning, then checked the cellar. The box hadn’t moved. The salt circle I’d drawn around it remained unbroken. But the floor above it had a fresh crack, like something had pushed up from underneath.

That morning, I went into town for the first time in weeks.

Wren Hollow hadn’t changed much in the decade I’d been gone. The gas station still only had one pump that worked. The diner still served lukewarm coffee with pie that tasted like cardboard. Most of the storefronts on Main Street were half-empty or shuttered entirely. The snow here clung properly to rooftops and sidewalks, and people nodded at me with polite suspicion.

At the edge of town, in a little trailer with a hand-painted sign that read Antiquities, Curios, & Sundries, lived a woman named Iola Pike. She’d been a fixture of the town since before I was born, older than the hills and twice as stubborn. My father used to call her “the swamp crow” when he thought I wasn’t listening, though I’d never seen her near any swamp, and she didn’t look much like a bird.

When I stepped inside, the bell above the door gave a metallic chime like a spoon striking bone. The smell of the place hadn’t changed—dried herbs, dust, and the sweet decay of time. Shelves lined every wall, filled with glass jars, taxidermy, yellowing books, and objects that looked like they’d been unearthed in places men shouldn’t dig.

Iola was perched behind the counter, wrapped in a shawl of green wool, her long grey braid draped over one shoulder. Her eyes were cloudy but sharp enough to cut glass.

“You’re Robert Ward’s boy,” she said without looking up.

“I guess I am.”

“Didn’t think I’d see you again.”

“I didn’t think I’d come back.”

She tapped ash from her cigarette into a chipped teacup. “That’s the way of it. The Hollow brings them back, sooner or later.”

I stiffened. “You know about the orchard?”

“I know about the crack in the world that runs through your family’s land. And I know your uncle Eli was the first to fall through it in fifty years.”

She lit another cigarette before the first had gone out. The smoke twisted in the air, curling like fingers.

“I need to know what I’m dealing with,” I said.

“No you don’t,” she said flatly. “You already do. You’re just hoping I’ll say something to make it easier. I won’t.”

I stepped closer to the counter, lowered my voice. “I brought something back. Or… something followed me. I locked it up. But it’s still moving.”

She didn’t flinch. “Did you bring a piece of it?”

“A seed.”

Her lips thinned. “Then it’s not following you. It is you now. That seed chose you the moment you carried it across.”

“What does it want?”

“Roots,” she said. “A place to grow. You think it’s silent, but it’s talking to the land. To everything that remembers. Trees. Shadows. Even people, if they’re hollow enough.”

I felt sick. “How do I stop it?”

“You don’t,” she said. “You bargain with it.”

“How?”

“You give it something else it wants more than you.”

I stood there for a moment, feeling the cold seep into my bones despite the warmth of the shop. Bargain. It sounded so… reasonable, which made it even more terrifying. As if what I carried was not just a force of nature, but something intelligent.

I turned to leave, but she said one more thing before I reached the door.

“It’s not the first time this has happened, you know. Your family’s been gatekeepers longer than you think. Your father just thought he could outrun it.”

I paused, then looked back. “And what about Eli?”

She didn’t answer at first. Just stared at me with those clouded eyes.

“Eli made a deal,” she said finally. “But deals don’t end. They just… shift.”

I left with more questions than answers, the same as every time I’d gone looking for truth in this town. The snow was falling again as I returned to the farmhouse, thicker now, heavy enough to obscure the trail back to the orchard.

That night, the knocking came again.

But this time, it came with a voice.

Low. Soft. Familiar.

“Silas. Let me in.”

And I did the one thing I promised myself I wouldn’t.

I listened.

The voice continued, repeating my name with patient persistence, like the dripping of water from a broken faucet. I lay in bed unmoving, heart hammering against my ribs, as though any shift of muscle or breath would draw it closer. It was Eli’s voice—at least, it wore his tone, his cadence, the lilt he always had at the end of a question, even when he wasn’t asking one. But it lacked the warmth I remembered. It felt hollow, like someone else playing Eli, like the way a ventriloquist moves his lips just slightly and pretends it's the puppet speaking.

“Silas… it’s cold down here.”

My bedroom window had frosted over. Outside, the snow fell in dense curtains, covering the orchard and barn, but again the far end beyond the split oak remained untouched. A dark corridor of earth and tree limbs still breathing in slow, subterranean pulses. I could feel the pressure of it now, like a wet cloth over my face, heavy and suffocating.

I didn’t respond. Instead, I closed my eyes and tried to will the voice away, but it stayed for hours, whispering through the floorboards, slipping between the cracks of the house like steam under a locked door. It told me things only Eli would know—how we’d broken a window with a slingshot when we were six, how we’d buried a toy soldier under the willow tree and called it a funeral. It whispered that Dad had tried to dig up the gate years ago, had failed, had made the seed angry. And now it needed new soil.

By morning, I was pale, exhausted, and sick with the taste of old ash in my mouth. I made coffee I didn’t drink and sat at the kitchen table watching the frost creep inward on the windowsill. I knew I couldn’t stay in that house much longer. Whatever tether had held the seed in place was fraying. The thing below was becoming stronger. More persuasive.

So I did what anyone does when fear gets too loud: I searched for something older than it. Something that might know what I was facing.

I found it in the attic.

Behind the boxes of yellowed tax documents and a trunk full of my mother’s dresses, I discovered a hidden panel in the wall. The latch was nearly invisible, but something—intuition, or perhaps the influence of the seed itself—drew my hand to it. Inside was a narrow compartment no larger than a drawer. A bundle of old cloth, tied in rotting twine. I unwrapped it slowly, careful not to break the brittle edges of the fabric.

Inside was a leather-bound book, handwritten in black ink, the cover etched with a single symbol I recognized immediately: the same spiral and branch etched onto the seed.

The handwriting was my grandfather’s.

His name was Thomas Ward, and I knew almost nothing about him. My father never spoke of the man. Not with bitterness, not with reverence—just silence, the kind you leave around a grave no one visits. But now here he was, a voice from before all of us, his words still inked into the pages after decades.

I was not the first, he wrote. But I will be the last.

That was the first line. What followed was a diary, a ledger, and a warning. He wrote of dreams—endless fields of white trees with red leaves, voices that came from the roots, faces in the cellar dirt. He wrote of the gate and the orchard and a “fracture line” that ran not just through the land, but through their blood. Every few generations, someone heard the call. Someone answered. Eli had been the most recent. But Thomas had heard it too, when he was a boy. He had sealed the gate with the help of a woman from town—he called her “the green-eyed witch”—and together they buried the last seed in iron and bone.

I heard it whisper once more before it died, he wrote. It said my son would open it again. That the orchard would never forget.

The pages following were filled with diagrams—wards, sigils, rituals written in a script that made my head ache to look at. There were instructions on how to bind a seed, how to trap its voice in a vessel of ash and salt. And finally, at the end, a letter.

Silas—if you find this, it means your father failed. That isn’t his fault. The seed is patient. And it waits for pain to make its move.

I don’t expect you to win. But I do expect you to choose. You’ll know when the moment comes. There is no right answer. Only sacrifice.

I’m sorry.

I sat with the book in my lap for a long time. It felt heavier than its weight. The attic was cold, but sweat slicked the back of my neck. I knew then that the thing in the cellar wasn’t just a seed. It was a memory given shape. A kind of parasite that lived not only in the soil but in the story of our family—feeding on the idea of us, generation after generation. And I had carried it further than anyone before me.

That night, I gathered the things the book said I’d need. A blade made of bone. Three strands of hair—mine, my father’s (which I found in an old shaving brush), and Eli’s (clipped from the collar of one of the coats still hanging in the closet). A jar of river water taken from the creek at dusk. And the seed, still locked in the box, still wrapped in burlap and salt. I placed it all on the kitchen table beneath the light of a dying bulb.

I waited until midnight.

Then I walked into the orchard.

The snow stopped at the line, just as before, and the trees leaned in like old men eager to gossip. I followed the path past the split oak, past the hollow tree, deeper than I had ever gone before. The air grew warm. Wet. I smelled rot and sweetness. A kind of fermentation.

At the center of the orchard, I found a stone circle I hadn’t seen before. It hadn’t been there the last time. But it had always been here. The earth had just been waiting for me to remember it.

I placed the seed in the center. Poured the river water over it. Drew the sigils from the book with my own blood on the stones. The ritual began, not with lightning or fire, but with breath. A deep inhalation from the trees, as though the entire orchard had lungs.

And then Eli stepped from the dark.

Only… it wasn’t him. Not exactly.

He had his face. His voice. But his eyes were empty—like candle stubs burnt down to the wick. The thing wearing my uncle’s skin smiled and stepped into the circle.

“You’re finally ready,” it said.

I raised the bone knife. My hands shook. My voice cracked. “I didn’t come to open the gate.”

“No,” it said. “You came to close it. But you’re too late.”

The seed cracked.

From within, something small and white began to unfurl—like a root, or a worm. It moved with purpose, reaching for the soil.

I lunged forward and drove the bone blade into the earth beside it. The trees howled. Not the wind—the trees. They screamed in every direction, a choir of grief and rage. The blade glowed briefly. Then went black.

The seed paused.

The Eli-thing stepped forward. “You can’t hold it. Not forever.”

“I don’t have to,” I said. “I just have to bury it deep enough that it forgets the way back.”

I poured the remaining river water over the root. Sprinkled the salt. Burned the strands of hair.

And then, from the trees, came another figure.

My father.

Or what was left of him.

His face was worn, transparent. A ghost dragged up by the ritual, or by my memory. He looked at me with eyes that no longer judged.

“Let go,” he said.

And I did.

I collapsed over the circle as the seed shriveled, recoiling into itself. The air tightened, then broke with a single pop, like a bubble bursting. The orchard exhaled. The wind returned.

When I woke, the snow had returned to the trees.

The circle was gone.

And so was the seed.

Chapter Three: The Memory That Waits

It snowed heavily the next three days. The orchard disappeared beneath a white blanket that looked too clean, too soft, like a freshly painted backdrop hiding the stage beneath. No more black streaks, no more heat rising off the soil. Everything was quiet again—eerily so. But the quiet now felt earned, not imposed. Like whatever had been stirring beneath the roots had finally gone still.

I didn’t dream for two nights. No voices. No whispers. Not even the usual nonsense flickers of thought that creep into the back of your eyes when you sleep too light. Just blackness. Blessed and deep. It wasn’t until the third night that a dream returned, and with it, the orchard.

But this time it was spring.

I was standing by the creek, and Eli was beside me, not as he had been in that strange version of himself, but younger—thirteen maybe—mud on his hands, a striped shirt pulled crooked across his chest. He was humming something I couldn’t place. A tune with no rhythm, no beginning. Just endless refrain. I tried to speak, but my voice didn’t work in the dream. My body wasn’t really there; I was just watching. Witnessing.

We walked together—he leading, me following—back through the trees. The orchard was blooming. White blossoms everywhere, petals falling like snow, sticking to the cuffs of Eli’s sleeves. We came to the split oak, and he knelt at its roots. Dug. Just a few inches down, he uncovered something wrapped in cloth.

He opened it.

Inside was a stone, smooth and dark, but not the one I’d brought back. This one pulsed faintly, like it breathed. Eli held it in both hands, tilted his head.

“I thought it was sleeping,” he whispered.

And then I woke.

The first thing I did after getting dressed was return to the orchard. The snow reached up to my knees, and every step took effort. I followed the same path, though I had no map to guide me this time. The trees were just trees again. No whispers. No movement. But I could feel something under the surface—a stillness that didn’t feel natural.

When I reached the split oak, I stood there a long time, listening.

Nothing.

But something drew my eyes downward. Not a sound or a shadow, just that sense you get when you walk into a room and feel you’ve forgotten something important.

I dropped to my knees and cleared the snow.

The roots of the tree curled up like twisted veins. The ground was frozen solid, but I scraped away a thin crust of ice until I saw the edge of something. Wood.

A box.

Not the one I’d buried. This one was older. I pried it out carefully with my hands, teeth chattering. It was small, cedar, with rusted hinges and no lock. When I opened it, I found a folded letter, yellowed with age and tied with a red string. Beneath it, a photograph. Two boys—my father and Eli again, younger this time, barely older than ten. They stood in front of the same split oak, both of them smiling, arms around each other’s shoulders. Behind them, just barely visible through the trees, was a third figure. Blurred. Watching.

I didn’t recognize the shape, but something about it made my skin crawl.

The letter was addressed to R.W.—my father.

I didn’t read it right away. I tucked it inside my coat and walked back home, heart hammering, unsure whether I was shivering from the cold or something deeper.

Back in the kitchen, I opened the letter.

Rob,

I know you’ll come back here. You always do when things break. If you’re reading this, it means I’ve already failed.

The orchard took something from me. From all of us. And I think part of it was never meant to be human in the first place.

I see it now—how it waited. How it shaped itself into Eli’s face. It doesn’t want the world. Not yet. It wants a home. Roots. Memory.

You’re not crazy. You were never crazy. But you have to remember: it can’t hurt what doesn’t remember. That’s why the forgetting matters.

If I don’t come back, don’t dig. Let the past stay buried. Let the memory rot. Or it will bloom again.

Forgive me. I couldn’t save him.

—T.W.

I read the letter twice. Then I sat in the silence of that old kitchen and thought about what it meant to forget someone you loved. What it would cost to un-remember your own brother. What kind of sacrifice that was, and why my father had never spoken Eli’s name without that hollow look in his eyes.

Memory. That was the key. The root. The seed.

It didn’t survive on flesh. It didn’t need blood.

It needed stories.

It fed on being remembered.

Every photograph in the house with Eli in it—there weren’t many—had been marked somehow. A smudge on his face. A corner torn. His name scratched out of a yearbook inscription. But my father hadn’t been able to forget completely. That was his failure. And now mine.

I had brought Eli back not just by crossing the threshold, but by thinking about him. By wanting to know more.

By remembering.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Instead, I gathered every photograph, every letter, every journal entry I’d written since returning. I tore the pages out. Burned them in the old stove. I took the photograph from the box beneath the tree and lit that, too. It curled black, the image of the two boys vanishing into cinders. I stood outside and watched the smoke disappear into the cold wind, and with it, something inside me frayed.

I was not afraid. Not then.

I was sad.

Because forgetting is a kind of dying.

And I wasn’t sure if I could ever truly do it.

The snow melted by the end of the week, and spring arrived early. The orchard bloomed, but this time the blossoms were pale pink, not white. There was no dark corridor. No heat in the roots. No whispers. Birds returned. Bees came in clusters. The land felt real again, grounded.

I still walk the orchard some mornings. I leave no offerings. I say no prayers. But I listen. I watch. I make sure the soil stays silent.

Sometimes I see a boy standing at the edge of the trees—just for a second. He never speaks. Never moves. He just watches.

And I tell myself he’s not real.

That he’s just a memory.

And I do not remember his name.

Spring bloomed with too much color. The grass came in fast, unnaturally green, pushing through the black soil in patches where snow had barely melted. Daffodils showed themselves like little yellow eyes, watching me from the hill above the creek. The air, for the first time in months, carried no weight—no scent of rot, no bitterness from bark. Just soil and wind and the early perfume of honeysuckle. It felt too good. Like the world was trying too hard to appear normal.

I spent more time outside then, walking the property each day just after dawn, boots wet with dew, rifle slung over one shoulder out of habit more than need. The animals had returned: rabbits darting under fenceposts, a fox near the barn, even a few deer wandering the orchard edges like ghosts wearing flesh. It all looked like it should. That was what unsettled me most. The normalcy arrived too cleanly, too completely, like someone had painted over the cracks in the world and hoped I wouldn't notice the bulge beneath the wallpaper.

I didn’t see the boy again—not at first. After the last burning, the final letter, I thought maybe it was over. Maybe I’d done enough. But then I began to notice small things, trivial things, the kind that make you pause mid-step. The willow near the creek had started blooming weeks early, which it never had before. The cellar stayed cold even on warm days, and twice I found the salt circle disturbed, not broken, but scuffed—like someone had paced around it. I began waking to the smell of pipe smoke, my father’s blend, sweet and earthy. The pipe itself hadn’t been touched. It stayed in the drawer beside his chair, clean and dry. But I smelled it anyway, always around dusk.

One morning, I found a footprint outside the hollow tree. Not mine. Too small. Barefoot. Just one print, half-melted in the grass. The weight of it made my heart seize.

I remembered the letter from my grandfather: It can’t hurt what doesn’t remember.

And yet, I couldn’t un-know what I knew. Couldn’t unsee the smile Eli wore, the way his voice bent in that not-quite-human cadence. Forgetting wasn’t just hard—it was unnatural. We are creatures of memory. Every cell in us remembers something, even when we wish it wouldn’t.

I called Iola Pike again.

She answered on the third ring, breathless and annoyed.

“You shouldn’t be calling here,” she said, no hello.

“I think something’s wrong again,” I told her.

A pause. “You didn’t burn the seed?”

“I did. Salt, blood, the whole ritual. The circle held.”

“Then it’s not the seed. It’s the soil.”

“What does that mean?”

“You live on memory, boy. And memory grows roots.”

She hung up.

That night I dreamed again. But it wasn’t the orchard. I was in the farmhouse, seated at the kitchen table, across from a child with dark hair and a face too familiar to ignore. He didn’t speak. He just smiled, swaying slightly in the chair, hands folded like he was waiting for me to finish a story. His eyes were brown. I remembered that. Eli had green eyes. My father, blue.

“Who are you?” I asked, finally able to speak in the dream.

He opened his mouth and spoke with my voice.

“I’m the part of you that never left.”

I woke with blood on my tongue. I’d bitten the inside of my cheek during sleep. The taste lingered like copper pennies and rusted nails.

The rest of the day passed in a haze. Every surface in the house looked like it might shift if I turned my back. I kept thinking I heard footsteps behind doors, felt warmth on a chair just vacated. There were no signs of intrusion. Just a growing awareness that something shared space with me again, unseen and increasingly unafraid.

By evening, I made a decision.

I returned to the hollow tree.

There was no key this time. No gate to unlock. Just the tree, wide and dark, pulsing with its own breath. I stepped close, ran a hand along its bark. Smooth now, as if time had buffed it into bone.

“I’m not here to open anything,” I said aloud. “I just need to understand.”

The wind kicked up. The leaves around me shivered. But nothing answered.

Then a sound—soft, rhythmic. A lullaby. Sung in a child’s voice. Coming from inside the hollow.

I didn’t enter. I knew better.

Instead, I reached into my coat and pulled out the last piece of the past I hadn’t burned. My father’s pipe. I placed it at the base of the tree.

“I remember you,” I said. “But I won’t let you grow here.”

The wind stopped.

I left the orchard before nightfall. Didn’t turn back. But I felt something behind me shift—like something that had been watching had finally closed its eyes.

The next few days passed in an uneasy quiet. Then the mail arrived.

Among the usual bills and catalogs was a plain white envelope, no return address, no stamp. Just my name, handwritten in ink that smelled faintly of cedar.

Inside was a single photo.

It was old, faded, curled at the corners. A picture of the orchard from decades ago. And standing in the center—so small I might’ve missed it—was the boy from my dream. He wore a striped shirt and smiled as if he’d been waiting to be found.

On the back of the photo, a single word had been written:

“Rooted.”

I burned it that night. But the fire flared high, too high, and for a moment the smoke rose not like a column but like a tree, with branches stretching toward the ceiling.

Then it was gone.

But the scent of cedar remained long after the flames had died.

Chapter Four: The House Beneath the Orchard

I began marking the days in the way prisoners do—scratches on the cellar wall. Not because I was trapped in any physical sense, but because I needed some rhythm to the silence that had taken hold. It wasn’t the same silence as before, the heavy kind that pressed in from the dark. This was subtler, more patient. Like the pause in a conversation when someone leans in, waiting to see what you’ll say next.

April slipped into May with little fanfare. The orchard ripened quickly, far ahead of schedule. Blossoms dropped and fruit began to swell where only flowers should have been. It wasn’t right. I’d lived here most of my childhood. Apples didn’t come this early, not even in good years. I started counting them. That’s how bored or anxious or unanchored I’d become. I walked row after row, tree after tree, noting which ones had fruit, which didn’t, and how many. I found a pattern by accident—every seventh tree bore two apples, exactly two, no more, no less. And the trees between those? Barren. As if something had moved through the orchard in perfect intervals, taking what it wanted and leaving silence in its wake.

The cellar grew colder. I stopped storing wood down there. The salt circle had been scuffed again, and I reinforced it with fresh chalk, double the lines. The box I’d used to bury the seed still sat in the center, wrapped and sealed, but I had the nagging suspicion it was no longer empty. That something else had moved into it.

I dreamed of footsteps beneath floorboards, of doors opening to staircases that descended forever. The house in my dreams was always mine—but wrong. Rooms too long, furniture placed just slightly off-center, like someone had rebuilt it from memory and hadn’t quite gotten it right. In one of those dreams, I found myself standing at the kitchen sink, staring out the window. The orchard beyond was black—not at night, but colorless. A void with shape. The trees were there, but drained of every hue, every sound. And in the center of that black orchard stood a house I didn’t recognize. Low-roofed. Windowless. Sunken into the earth.

I woke gasping, mouth dry, shirt damp with sweat. The image stayed with me all day. That house beneath the orchard—it didn’t belong to this world. But I had the terrible certainty that it had once been real. Maybe still was. Just beneath the surface.

Iola didn’t answer her phone anymore. I drove into town on a Thursday, thinking maybe I’d check on her. Her shop was closed, curtains drawn, dust on the windows. A faded sign on the door read, “Closed for good. We tried.”

I asked around. Nobody had seen her in over a week.

“Probably went north,” one of the waitresses at the diner said. “She always hated spring.”

I didn’t believe it. But I didn’t press. People in Wren Hollow didn’t like questions, and I’d already asked more than my share.

The next night, I went back to the hollow tree.

I didn’t bring anything. No salt, no charms, no iron. Just myself.

The tree stood as it always had, rooted like a monument to whatever gods had come before soil was called soil. I ran a hand over its bark. It felt warm again, just slightly. Like something breathing on the other side.

“Are you still there?” I asked.

No answer. Not right away.

Then, a sound.

A knock.

From inside the tree.

Three soft raps.

I staggered back, nearly falling over my own boots. The orchard swayed gently in the breeze—if there was a breeze. I couldn’t feel it on my skin. But the trees moved all the same, like an audience waiting for the curtain to rise.

And then I heard a child laughing.

Not from within the tree. From somewhere deeper in the orchard.

It was distant, echoing through the rows, bending the space between trees like a mirror stretched too far. I knew that laugh. It was mine.

Not from now. From years ago.

That’s when I understood.

It wasn’t Eli who was coming through this time.

It was me.

Not the me I knew. The me that had never come back. The boy who had once wandered too far into the orchard and seen something he wasn’t meant to. The boy who had buried a toy soldier and dug up a stone instead. That version of me—half memory, half shadow—had been waiting in the house beneath the orchard. Feeding on the recollections, on the scraps of story I’d tried so hard to burn away.

You can’t kill memory. Not entirely.

You can only choose what shape it takes.

I returned home, pulled up the floorboards in the attic, and took out the journal my father had left—the one I hadn’t yet dared finish. I’d only read pieces before, too afraid of what I’d find in the final pages. But now, I needed to see.

The last entry wasn’t a warning. It wasn’t even a goodbye.

It was a map.

Drawn in ink so faint I hadn’t noticed it before. The orchard sketched from above, each tree marked with tiny symbols. In the center: a spiral. The same spiral that had been on the stone. On the seed. On the box.

Beneath it, a word: “Door.”

Not gate. Not threshold. Not even portal.

Door.

Doors go both ways.

The house beneath the orchard wasn’t just a metaphor or dream. It was real. Or real enough.

And if it had a door, it could be opened.

Or sealed.

I packed for the journey as one might pack for a pilgrimage. Rope. Lantern. The bone knife. A compass that had never worked right but still made me feel safer. I took nothing that tied me to the present. No phone. No clock. Just tools, the kind you take when you expect not to return.

The next morning, I marked the spiral on the orchard floor with lime powder. It didn’t take long. The pattern was already there beneath the soil. My father hadn’t drawn it. He’d traced it.

At the spiral’s center, I began to dig.

The earth came up easy at first, then turned dense, rich with a scent like rotting fruit. After three feet, the color changed—from brown to black, and then to a deep red clay. I kept digging. Hands blistered. Arms shaking.

At five feet, I found the roof.

Wooden. Warped. Covered in moss that hadn’t grown naturally.

I brushed it away. Beneath it, a handle.

A door.

I took one last look at the orchard.

And then I opened it.

The door opened inward without resistance, though its hinges groaned with the weight of decades. A rush of air rose from below—not fetid or foul as I expected, but dry, ancient, and startlingly cold. The scent wasn’t rot, but old wood and something harder to name, like the breath of a closed room that had never been meant to be entered again. My lantern flared as I descended, casting a soft orange glow against the curved earthen walls of the passage beneath the orchard. The staircase wasn’t stone or plank, but root—thick, gnarled tendrils curled together like ribs, forming a path that led down into a place untouched by sun or season.

I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. The moment I stepped fully inside, I felt the pressure of the world above lift, like surfacing from deep water. My ears rang. My breath came easier, but colder. There was no sound beyond my footsteps. Even the creak of my boots seemed wrong here, swallowed by the earth.

The path wound downward in a slow spiral, the roots woven so tightly they may as well have been carved from one solid mass. Along the walls, faint carvings began to appear, shallow lines etched in overlapping arcs—language, or something older than language. Some were familiar—resembling the sigils from my grandfather’s journal—but others bent in unnatural shapes that made my vision blur if I looked too long.

Eventually, the tunnel leveled out into a chamber the size of a barn cellar. The floor was packed clay, the ceiling low enough I had to stoop slightly. In the center stood a table, and around it, six chairs. Each was different—one carved from stone, another from twisted metal, one from something that looked like antler. Each faced inward, surrounding a seventh chair at the head of the table, which was empty.

On the table sat objects. A cracked teacup. A pair of rusted scissors. A child’s shoe. A pipe, identical to my father’s. A photograph of a house I did not recognize but felt deeply in my gut I had once visited. And finally, a single black stone. Smooth. Oval. Not the seed. Not exactly. But a cousin to it.

I reached for the photograph first. The house in the picture stood crookedly on a slight hill, with windows that seemed too small for the structure. There were no trees around it. No sky. Just the house and a horizonless plain, faded at the edges like a dream remembered wrong. On the back of the photo, someone had scrawled: “Don’t look behind it.”

I set the photo down carefully.

My hand hovered over the stone.

“Be careful,” said a voice, low and distant.

I spun, raising the lantern. No one. Just the root walls and the chairs and the table.

Then the stone pulsed.

Not with light or sound, but with memory.

Suddenly, I was nine years old again, running barefoot through the orchard after a thunderstorm. The air was thick with ozone. I was laughing. Eli was ahead of me, hair plastered to his forehead, calling back: “Come on, Silas, this way!” We were chasing something—a light, a sound, I don’t remember. We stopped near the creek, breathless, soaked. Eli looked at me, serious all of a sudden, and said, “Promise you won’t forget this.”

Then the memory snapped away.

I stumbled, gripping the edge of the table. My hands trembled. The stone had given it to me—a moment I had not known I’d lost. But it hadn’t done so kindly. There had been something inside the memory, behind the color and the sound, like a shape glimpsed behind smoke. Watching.

I didn’t touch the stone again.

Instead, I turned to the far side of the chamber, where a second door waited.

This one was different. Smooth. Seamless. Not made of wood or root, but something pale and hard—bone, maybe, or a mineral I didn’t recognize. A single symbol marked the center: the spiral.

There was no handle. No lock.

Just a thin crack down the center, as if it would open when asked properly.

I didn’t speak. I just stood in front of it, letting whatever part of me had carried this burden since birth rise to the surface. The boy in the orchard. The man with the seed. The brother who had tried to come back. All of it swirled behind my ribs like a storm gathering speed.

And the door opened.

Beyond it was not another chamber, but a forest.

Impossible, I know. But real.

The air was clean, sharp like the mountains in early winter. The sky above shimmered pale violet, a color that did not belong to dusk or dawn. Trees surrounded me, tall and thin, their bark silver, their leaves deep red. The ground glowed faintly where my boots pressed it. No birds. No wind. Just that hum again, low and persistent, like the world had its own breath, slow and patient.

I stepped through.

The forest welcomed me with silence. Not hostility. Not fear.

Recognition.

I followed a narrow path between the trees. It wound gently downhill, the forest sloping toward a hollow in the distance. And there, nestled in the low belly of the land, was the house from the photograph.

Crooked. Leaning. Too tall and too narrow in places. Its roof sagged like it had been crying for centuries. And though I had never been there in waking life, I knew the porch would creak beneath my weight. That the third step would dip. That the door would stick unless lifted slightly before pushing.

I knew it because this was the house of memory.

My memory.

And something inside waited for me.

I climbed the steps, each one echoing louder than the last. The door opened before I could touch it.

Inside, the house breathed.

I don’t mean it in metaphor. The walls expanded. Contracted. The air moved not with breeze but with rhythm. Heartbeat. Breath. Each room I passed—kitchen, parlor, hallway—was a version of places I’d known twisted through recollection. My father’s voice echoed from the stairwell. My mother’s laughter drifted from the cellar. The sound of Eli’s humming rose and fell between the walls.

I found the boy in the attic.

He sat by the window, knees drawn to his chest. He wore my face. My shirt. His hands were covered in dirt. He looked up as I entered, and his eyes were empty.

“I waited,” he said.

“I know,” I whispered.

“I kept it safe.”

“What?”

He held out his hands.

In them was the seed.

Not the one I’d burned. Another. Whole. Unscarred.

“I didn’t mean to,” the boy said. “But I remember everything. And it remembered me.”

I stepped forward. My breath came in shallow bursts. The house creaked around us, slow and groaning, as if its walls disapproved of this reunion.

“What do I do?” I asked.

“Forget,” he said. “Please.”

And then he held out the seed.

I took it.

It was warm.

It pulsed once, like a living thing.

And in that moment I knew: this wasn’t a curse, or a haunting, or even an entity. It was a legacy. A memory passed too many times, by too many hands. It had grown roots through us—not through the land. Through story.

We had fed it.

Not through belief.

But through remembrance.

And now, I held the choice.

To carry it forward.

Or to bury it where no story could reach.

I stood in that crooked attic, holding the seed, the boy watching me with an expression I couldn’t parse—somewhere between sorrow and relief. His face, so close to mine in shape and memory, seemed to shimmer faintly in the low light filtering through the warped glass. The walls around us pulsed, steady as a resting heartbeat, and I understood in some unspoken, ancient way that the house was not just built from memory but fed by it.

“I’ve kept it too long,” the boy said again, his voice lower now, almost brittle. “It grows heavier each year.”

He looked at me with a pleading in his eyes that made my throat tighten. “It’s not supposed to be kept. That’s not what it was made for.”

“What was it made for?” I asked, my voice hoarse.

“To be forgotten,” he whispered. “That’s the only way it dies.”

But forgetting isn’t easy. It’s not like losing a set of keys or misplacing a name. It takes effort. Ritual. Will. You don’t just erase memory—you trade it, lock it away, bury it beneath something deeper. My grandfather had tried. My father had tried. Eli had made his deal and never come back the same. And now here I was, holding the last piece, the final echo.

“I don’t know if I can,” I said.

“You have to,” he replied, and he was crying now, though no tears fell. “If you carry it out, it comes with you. And it remembers the way. Again.”

I looked at the seed. Its surface glimmered faintly, as though it caught light from nowhere. It pulsed—slow, insistent, not like a heart, but like the ticking of a buried clock, waiting to be unearthed.

“What happens if I stay?” I asked.

The boy shook his head. “You won’t stay. Not really. You’ll split. Part of you will walk out, thinking you left it behind. But the other part will sit here, always, forever, holding it. Waiting for someone else to find the door.”

My hand closed around the seed, and I felt a surge of something—not power, not fear, but a memory not my own.

A child in a stone cellar, hiding in a barrel while his father hammered sigils into the wall. A woman in a red shawl drawing a spiral in the dust with blood. A scream, low and wordless, echoing across time.

None of it belonged to me.

All of it lived inside me now.

I turned away from the boy. He didn’t follow.

“I’m sorry,” I said.

He didn’t respond. I stepped back through the attic door, and the house groaned again. The stairwell bent slightly underfoot. My lantern flickered, casting strange shapes on the warped walls. Faces formed and disappeared in the wood grain—some I knew, others I hoped I’d never have to. My father’s face. My mother’s. Eli’s. Even mine, though older, sunken, tired.

The house didn’t want me to go.

But it didn’t stop me either.

When I reached the forest again, the violet sky had dimmed, and the red-leaf trees swayed gently in a wind that didn’t touch my skin. I passed between them without looking back. The door in the white wall waited open, the spiral glowing faintly now, not as a warning, but as a farewell.

I crossed the threshold, and the chamber with the table greeted me like a held breath. The stone, the photo, the scissors—all still in place. I passed them without pause. Up the root-stair I climbed, each step feeling heavier, like gravity wanted me to change my mind.

But I didn’t.

I emerged into daylight, though I couldn’t tell how much time had passed. My limbs ached. My chest burned. The seed in my pocket pulsed softly, less insistently now, as if it knew this was the end.

I walked back to the farmhouse without speaking, without thinking. Just walking. The orchard was quiet. Still. The blossoms had dropped. The apples had vanished. Nothing left but branches and the rustle of wind.

Inside, I lit the stove. Took a shovel from the shed. I didn’t go to the cellar. That place had held too much already. Instead, I returned to the willow by the creek—the place Eli and I had once played, where we’d buried that soldier, long ago.

I dug until the shovel struck stone.

I didn’t know it was there. I hadn’t placed it.

It didn’t matter.

I laid the seed in the shallow depression above the stone. No salt. No iron. No blood. Just earth. I covered it slowly. Pressed the soil flat with my palms. No prayer, no incantation.

Only silence.

Then I stood, heart pounding, hands caked in dirt, and whispered the only thing that came to me.

“I forget you.”

It hurt more than I expected.

The world didn’t shift. The sky didn’t crack. But something inside me unraveled, like a knot pulled slowly from the center outward. I felt my body stiffen, as if muscles long dormant had finally relaxed. My head lightened. My chest stopped its constant clenching.

And the pulse in my pocket stopped.

I walked home without remembering the exact path.

That night, I slept without dreams.

The next morning, I found the photograph again—though I had no memory of keeping it. It lay on the kitchen table, curled and pale, showing a house I didn’t know and a boy whose face was unfamiliar.

There was no writing on the back this time.

I burned it anyway.

And when I opened my journal, ready to write what had happened, I found only blank pages.

Not because the ink had vanished.

But because I no longer knew what story I’d meant to tell.

Chapter Five: The Hollowing

Summer came quietly. There were no storms, no great heatwave or sudden bloom. It just settled over Wren Hollow one morning, the way sleep comes after a long illness—gently, without triumph. The orchard remained still. Its branches didn’t quake. Its bark didn’t pulse. It had returned to the shape of ordinary things. But I knew better. The silence was not victory. It was pause.

Some mornings I woke up convinced I had never gone down into the house beneath the orchard. That there had never been a door, a spiral, or a boy in an attic handing me anything. That I had simply lost time to grief, and everything else had been some hallucination stitched together by my mind in its effort to make sense of the loneliness my father left behind.

Then I’d find things—small, quiet proofs.

A new spiral carved into the wood of the barn’s door.

A seed, identical to the one I buried, lodged in the tines of a garden fork.

A set of footprints circling the willow tree, barefoot, too small to be mine.

These were not the signs of an active presence. They were echoes. Faint, but insistent. The way a word said too many times loses meaning but never weight. I started calling them remnants. Not hauntings. Not warnings. Just… residues. Proof that something had passed through and left part of itself behind.

There were no more dreams. But waking life sometimes felt like a dream, colors a little too saturated, sounds ringing just a second too long. The edges of things blurred when I stared too hard—trees, doors, the lines of my own hands. I stopped trusting mirrors. They showed me as I was, but not as I remembered being.

One day in early July, I walked into town.

The sky had that peculiar light to it, where everything looks like it might rain but never does. A few people nodded at me as I passed. Most didn’t look up. I didn’t take offense. Wren Hollow had always been that way—half of its people belonged to the land, the other half tried not to notice the cost.

At the library, I found something unexpected.

A file—thin and dusty—filed under “Ward, Eli.”

I didn’t ask why it existed. I just opened it.

Inside were two documents: a missing person’s report from 1976, and a faded letter marked “unsent” in shaky handwriting. The report listed Eli as having disappeared from the Ward property at age fourteen. No body recovered. No signs of foul play. Filed by Robert Ward—my father. No follow-up.

The letter was more personal. It was addressed to my grandfather.

    “Dad,

    I think I did something wrong. He was talking to something before he went missing. I found symbols carved into the trees. I think I saw a gate open in the orchard, but it could have been a dream. He said it called to him. I thought I could fix it, that if I kept him out of there, it wouldn’t happen again. But I was wrong.

    I hear things now too.

    I’m going to try what you did. If it doesn’t work… I’m sorry.”

There was no signature.

I sat with the letter for a long time, the quiet hum of the library pressing in on all sides. The hum reminded me of that house beneath the orchard—constant, without source. I put the letter back in the file and left it on the desk. Some things don’t belong in pockets.

That night, I stood by the willow again. I waited. Not for anything specific. Not for Eli or the boy or the shadow of memory. I just waited, hoping that something would change. That the wind might carry an answer.

Instead, I found a gift.

At the base of the tree, nestled in the roots, lay a small wooden figure. Carved crudely. It looked like a person, maybe a child. Its head was slightly too large for its body. One eye was scratched out. The other was a knot in the wood, untouched. On its chest, the spiral.

I didn’t touch it. I buried it there, beneath the roots.

I didn’t speak to it.

Didn’t name it.

Just covered it with soil and walked away.

The next day, the figure was back.

Not where I’d buried it, but in the kitchen, placed neatly on the windowsill above the sink.

I laughed when I saw it. Not because it was funny—but because of the simple absurdity of it. I hadn’t heard a sound. No doors creaked, no windows opened. But there it was, the same wooden figure, same spiral, same missing eye.

This time, I burned it.

It didn’t scream. It didn’t resist.

It cracked once, loudly.

And then it turned to ash.

After that, I left the house for a week. I camped by the creek in a tent I’d kept in the barn for years. It felt safer, somehow. The sky looked bigger there. The ground felt neutral, like it didn’t remember me yet. I cooked over a fire, washed in the cold water, slept lightly and woke early. And still, on the sixth morning, I found the figure again—this time beside my boots, waiting.

It was whole again.

Both eyes intact.

No spiral.

Only a word carved into its back: “STAY.”

I didn’t burn it this time.

I placed it in the creek and watched it float away.

Then I went home.

Back at the house, everything looked untouched. The floor was clean. The windows dusty. The cellar door was closed. But the orchard? It had changed.

The grass was too high.

The trees leaned just a little.

And the air smelled of cedar and something faintly metallic.

I walked to the edge and stopped.

The hollow tree stood in its usual place. Still. Bark grey as ash.

I stepped close. Touched it.

No pulse.

No warmth.

No door.

I stood there a long time, waiting for it to open.

But it never did.

I returned to the hollow tree each day for a week. At first in the mornings, then again at dusk, and finally at night, when the world quieted down to its deepest, loneliest hum. I brought nothing with me. No offerings, no symbols, no words. I simply stood there and waited, thinking maybe it was like an animal—skittish, unwilling to come near unless you pretended not to care.

But the tree stayed dormant.

The bark never breathed. The faint groove where the keyhole had once been was now smooth and closed. Not sealed, exactly—more like healed. Whatever wound had once existed there had scabbed over, and I wasn’t sure if that meant it was gone for good or simply waiting again, the way seeds do, sleeping under snow.

One evening, after another fruitless hour spent beside it, I started to walk away and caught a flicker of something in my peripheral vision. Just a shimmer—a color that didn’t belong, a distortion in the corner of my eye like heat off a road. I turned. Nothing. Just the orchard, bathed in that tired, gold-pink light before true dark.

Still, I didn’t imagine it.

The shimmer came again the next night, and the next. It never moved, never grew. But it stayed. And I understood then—it wasn’t the tree anymore.

The gate had shifted.

I followed the shimmer on the fourth night. It wasn’t a glow so much as an absence, like a place where the world forgot to color itself in. I stepped through the orchard, crunching leaves and avoiding the gnarled, dry roots that coiled across the soil like fingers.

The shimmer led me past the split oak, down the far slope where the orchard thins and becomes something wilder—less cultivated, more like the woods I remembered exploring as a child before my father told me not to go there. He’d never explained why. He never needed to. Even then, it had felt like a boundary you crossed at your own risk.

I kept walking.

There was no clear path, no trail, just the shimmer, always just ahead, as if leading me into a memory I hadn’t made yet. At some point, I realized the sounds of the world had stopped. No birds. No breeze. Not even the rustling of my own boots.

Then I saw it.

A clearing.

Roughly circular. Flattened grass in the center, arranged in a spiral, the same old pattern—just slightly misshapen, as though drawn by an unsteady hand. And in the center stood a mirror.

Not hanging. Not framed.

A tall pane of glass, rectangular, upright, set into a thin wooden stand so fragile it looked as though a breeze could tip it. The glass was old—not dusty, not cracked—but rippled in a way that made reflections slide and twist like water. I approached carefully, my chest tightening with each step. I was afraid, but not of what I would see.

I was afraid of what might look back.

When I stood before it, the reflection showed me. Not twisted. Not monstrous.

Just me.

Older, perhaps. Sadder. My shoulders hunched a little more than they should’ve been. My hair thinner. But my eyes… they weren’t mine. They were empty. Familiar.

I stared at the reflection for a long while.

It didn’t blink when I did.

Didn’t tilt its head when I leaned closer.

It just stared.

Then it smiled.

Only the reflection. Not me.

It was Eli’s smile. And my father’s. And mine.

I stepped back.

The smile held a moment, then faded.

That night, I did something I hadn’t done since my father died. I went to the attic and opened the old chest with the photo albums. I flipped through them slowly, page by page. There were fewer photos of Eli than I remembered. Some had faded. Some had been removed entirely, the outlines of the missing prints leaving pale ghosts behind. And the ones that remained? His face blurred just slightly, like time didn’t want to hold onto him anymore.

One photo caught my eye.

It was from the year before he vanished—1975. A picnic by the creek. My father, younger, lean, smiling in a way I never saw him smile in life. My mother, pregnant with me. And Eli, standing behind them, eyes cast sideways toward something out of frame.

There was something in his hand.

I hadn’t noticed it before.

A wooden figure.

Crude. Carved.

Just like the one that had followed me.

I turned the photo over.

In faded ink: “July. The last time it was quiet.”

I stared at those words for a long time. Not because they were profound, but because of what they meant. Eli hadn’t vanished in a storm. He hadn’t been taken all at once.

It had been slow.

A hollowing.

That was what the seed did. It waited. Not in the soil, not in the trees. But in us. It turned memory into a path. A story into a doorway. And once the story was told enough times, remembered hard enough, it became real.

That’s why it didn’t matter how many times we buried the thing.

As long as someone remembered, it could always come back.

I closed the album and looked out the attic window toward the orchard. The trees were still. But I saw something move at the edge of the woods. A figure. Small. Watching.

I didn’t go out. Not that night.

Instead, I went to the cellar.

I took the box—the one where I’d once buried the seed—and brought it upstairs. I opened it and placed inside everything I could remember. A scrap of the spiral-marked paper. The pipe. A page torn from my father’s journal. The burned edge of the photograph. I placed the wooden figure in last.

Then I sealed it with wax.

On the lid, I carved one word:

“Unspoken.”

The next morning, I drove thirty miles out of town to a small ravine I’d once visited as a child on a school hike. It was steep and wooded and full of places no one would stumble upon unless they were truly lost. I buried the box beneath a slab of shale. Covered it with stones. Walked away.

I didn’t pray. Didn’t say goodbye.

Only made a promise:

If it ever came back, it would not be through me.

Chapter Six: The Quiet Season

The summer wore on. August arrived dry and mean, cracking the orchard soil into flakes, thinning the creek into a trickle. I stopped trying to mark the days. They passed without events, as if time had grown tired of making an effort. I kept the house clean. Fixed a shutter. Repaired a fence gate near the southern property line. All the while, the hollow tree remained still, as if asleep with its back turned.

And yet, I never once felt alone.

It was nothing overt. No voices. No laughter echoing from the walls. But I would find things out of place. A chair shifted two inches. A drawer left ajar. My boots set neatly beside the door, even when I remembered leaving them in the barn. I began setting traps—not cruel ones, just little arrangements: coins balanced on the edge of a shelf, thread pulled across doorframes, a piece of charcoal resting on a windowsill. Every morning, one would be disturbed.

I told myself it was the house settling. Or rodents. Or habit. But the truth I couldn’t say aloud was this: I’d never left the orchard. Not really. It had grown through me now. Its shape was in my spine. Its silence lived behind my eyes. The seed was buried, yes. Forgotten, no.

You don’t survive something like that. You carry it.

One night, the phone rang.

It startled me so badly I nearly dropped the kettle I was carrying.

No one had called the house phone in months. Everyone I knew either texted or stopped caring. But I still kept the landline, like a relic.

The number was unknown. I hesitated, then picked up.

“Hello?”

A pause.

Then a voice—thin, worn, nearly hollow: “Silas Ward?”

“Yes. Who is this?”

“I used to live in your house.”

I gripped the counter. “Who is this?”

“My name’s Molly Kerrigan. My family rented the Ward property in the '90s, just a few seasons. Summer mostly. I think you were off at school by then.”

I sat down.

“I remember your name,” I said. “Barely.”

Molly let out a breath that wasn’t quite a laugh.

“I’ve had dreams about your orchard for twenty years.”

The silence on my end stretched.

“You’re not the only one,” I finally said.

“No,” she whispered. “I figured as much.”

Her voice was calm, but it carried something heavy, like someone who had been pushing a rock uphill for so long she forgot what it was like to stand still.

“I only saw it once,” she continued. “Late July. I’d been out late, walking after dinner. I wandered too far. I was thirteen. I found a clearing. There was a door in the ground. When I got close, it disappeared.”

My throat was dry.

“Did you go back?” I asked.

“I tried. It was never there again. But that was the year my brother changed.”

I closed my eyes. “What happened?”

“He was younger. Seven. After that summer, he started sleepwalking. Talking in his sleep. He’d dig in the yard, burying little bundles of twine and leaves. When my parents moved us out, he cried for days. He kept whispering, ‘I promised to watch it. I promised.’”

A pause.

“He died four years ago. Drowned in a pond near our home in Oregon. We found him face down, holding a stick with the spiral scratched into the bark.”

I didn’t speak.

“I thought I was going crazy,” she said. “But then I found your name. And the records. The stories.”

“You’re not crazy,” I said.

“I know that now. But I need to know if it’s done. If the thing is still out there.”

My eyes drifted to the orchard window.

“It’s quiet,” I said. “But it’s never gone.”

Molly was silent for a long time.

Then: “Can I ask you something?”

“Of course.”

“Did it ever feel like it wasn’t trying to hurt us? Like it just… wanted something?”

I hesitated.

“Yes,” I said. “That’s the hardest part.”

We said nothing after that for a while. Then she thanked me. Said goodbye. Hung up.

I sat at the table for a long time after, staring at the wall, thinking about how far its roots had spread. The orchard wasn’t just here. It was a shape. A pattern. A story told and retold in different places, passed between people like a shared dream. My family had anchored it. But it had grown hungry enough to stretch beyond our blood.

A week later, I received a package in the mail. No return address. Inside was a single item: a child’s drawing, yellowed with age.

A stick figure stood beside a large spiral. A line of trees surrounded them. And above, in shaky block letters:
“IT’S MY TURN TO WATCH”

There was no note.

Just a second sheet of paper beneath it, blank, except for one sentence written in careful, adult handwriting:

“How do you unmake a story?”

I had no answer.

That night, I went back to the willow tree.

The earth was undisturbed. No footprints. No figures. The breeze was soft and clean. I sat there until the stars came out.

And then I spoke—not to summon, not to confront. Just to speak.

“I’m sorry,” I said.

“For burying you. For carrying you. For remembering.”

The wind shifted slightly.

And I swear I heard a voice—not Eli’s, not my father’s.

A child’s voice.

Mine.

“Thank you.”

The breeze passed.

The orchard stayed still.

And I finally stood and walked back toward the house, not in fear, not in mourning, but in a kind of quiet, exhausted peace.

Because I knew, for now, that was enough.

The following morning brought fog—dense, low, and unmoving. It clung to the fields and the orchard like it had grown from the soil itself rather than descended from the sky. From the porch, the trees were only silhouettes, dark shapes blurred at the edges, familiar but just distorted enough to keep my hand from the doorknob. I didn’t go outside that day. Instead, I stayed in, cleaned the floors, oiled the old desk drawers, and organized what little was left in the pantry. The hum of the fridge and the occasional creak of the floorboards overhead were the only sounds that reminded me I was awake.

By noon the fog hadn't lifted. It pressed against the windows in soft waves. The stillness of it unnerved me more than any shadow I’d seen. Fog usually moved, swirled, responded to wind or passing cars. This fog just stayed, like a thought that wouldn’t leave. And even with all the curtains drawn, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching the house—not from the outside, but from the inside. Like the walls had eyes again.

At some point during the day, I found myself standing in the narrow hallway between the living room and my father’s study. I hadn’t opened that room since the funeral. I don’t know why I did it then. Maybe I was tired of the silence. Maybe the fog pushed me toward it. The door creaked open as if relieved to be used.

The study was untouched—dust on every surface, books lining the shelves in their same odd, uneven rows, a lamp still plugged in but long since burned out. His chair was turned just slightly toward the window, as if he’d stood up mid-thought and never sat again. I ran a hand over the desk and left a clean streak in the dust.

There were still papers in the drawer. I leafed through them absently—notes on taxes, phone numbers scrawled with no names, an old grocery list. Nothing mystical. No hidden maps or incantations. Just the mundane echoes of a life. But in the back, tucked inside a yellowing envelope, I found something that caught my breath.

A drawing.

It was crayon on construction paper—worn and cracked in the folds. The color had faded, but I could still make it out: a boy and a man, standing side by side in front of a row of trees. In the corner, a small black circle with lines spiraling out. The boy had written in large, shaky letters: Me and Dad, watching the gate.

I didn’t remember drawing it.

I didn’t remember being told about the gate that young.

But the handwriting was mine.

The fog stayed for two more days. It never rained. It never moved. It just hovered over everything like a held breath. And then, as suddenly as it had come, it lifted.

The orchard was unchanged. The grass had grown longer, wild in some places, matting down in wide circles like something had lain there. A few trees had begun to drop their fruit, though it was still early in the season. I picked one—small, green with a brown streak—and bit into it out of habit. The taste was sharp. Not bitter, not sweet. Just unfamiliar.

That night, I wrote a letter.

Not to anyone living. Not to Molly Kerrigan or to whatever bureaucrat might eventually inherit the house if I disappeared. I wrote to Eli.

Dear Eli,
I don’t know where you are now. I don’t know if you were ever whole again. Maybe part of you is still in the house beneath the orchard, in that crooked attic. Maybe you were never anything but memory. But if you are listening—if something of you still moves between the roots and shadows—I want you to know I tried.

Dad didn’t forget you. Not really. Neither did I. But I see now that remembering isn’t always love. Sometimes it’s a chain. Sometimes it feeds what should be left buried.

I hope, wherever you are, you’ve let go. Or that someone helped you.

If I carry this thing for the rest of my life, it won’t be because I failed. It’ll be because someone had to.

—Silas

I folded the letter and placed it beneath my mattress.

That night, I dreamed of the orchard again—but it was winter. Snow blanketed the trees, and each one was bare, skeletal, the limbs stretching to the sky like arms asking to be taken. The hollow tree was gone. In its place, a stone pillar. Smooth. Pale. Marked with a spiral. And written in the snow at its base were words:

You were never the seed. You were the soil.

I woke with tears on my face.

Not from fear.

From relief.

Because somehow, that meant it was over.

Or, if not over, then finally at rest.

The weeks that followed were quiet in the truest sense. Not an eerie silence, but a genuine stillness. The kind that sits in a room when the music ends and no one rushes to fill the void. I took long walks. I repaired the shed roof. I re-sorted the canning jars my mother had kept in the cellar. I even baked bread one morning and ate it warm with jam, something I hadn’t done since childhood.

The orchard didn’t speak. It didn’t shimmer or hum. But I still visited it, like checking on an old friend recovering from a long illness.

And then, one morning, I found a child’s drawing pinned to the front door with a small nail.

The picture was crude. Two stick figures—one tall, one small—stood beside a tree. Between them, a spiral. And beneath, scrawled in a hand I didn’t know, three words:

It found you.

I stared at the drawing for a long time before removing it from the door. The nail had been driven deep, not hastily or with a child’s uncertain aim, but with deliberation. I ran my thumb over the paper. It was cheap, thin, the kind used in schoolrooms and waiting rooms—staple of kindergarten art projects. The crayon had smudged in places, the red of the spiral bleeding slightly into the stick figures. One figure had no face. The other had too many lines where a mouth should have been.

I took it inside and laid it on the kitchen table beside the others I’d kept, the ones I swore I’d destroy and never had the heart to. Each had come unexpectedly. Left in places no one should have reached—on the back porch, slipped between pages of old books, once even folded into the pocket of a coat I hadn’t worn in weeks. There were seven now. All drawn in different hands. Some shaky and new, others confident and sharp. The only constant was the spiral.

I didn’t know who sent them.

But I knew why.

The orchard was spreading again—not as place, but as idea. As memory. And someone—maybe several someones—was passing it along. Perhaps not maliciously. Perhaps not even knowingly. Just as I had. Just as my father and grandfather had, whether they admitted it or not.

By speaking of it. By writing it down.

By remembering.

I burned the drawings that night.

Each one curled slowly, stubborn to catch, as though the paper resisted forgetting. The last to go was the newest. The flame crawled across the spiral with reluctance, turning the red lines black, then to ash. The smoke that rose smelled faintly sweet, almost like apples.

I opened every window in the house.

The air outside was warm. Still. No wind. No sound of insects or owls. Just that waiting quiet, thick as syrup, that came before the orchard decided to speak again.

I slept lightly.

Dreamless.

But when I woke, I found something strange in the hallway: muddy footprints.

Child-sized.

Leading from the front door to the attic stairs.

There were no marks on the door, no broken windows. The lock was untouched. Nothing was stolen. But the tracks were real, drying in faint brown smears across the floorboards. I followed them slowly, heart thudding, up the narrow stairs. The attic was dark and still. The dust undisturbed.

Except for the chair in the far corner.

It faced the window now.

And resting on its seat was a stone—flat, black, familiar. But smaller than the seed had been. No glow. No warmth. Just stone. At its center, faint but visible, the spiral.

I didn’t touch it.

I stepped back, descended the stairs, and closed the attic door.

I made coffee. Fed the dog I didn’t have. Stared out the window and tried to pretend the orchard hadn’t started again.

But I knew it had.

Not loudly. Not with thunder or split trees or the opening of impossible doors.

Subtly.

Softly.

Through footsteps and drawings and things that should have stayed buried.

It had found a way back.

Not as seed.

Not as story.

As inheritance.

That afternoon, I called Molly Kerrigan.

She answered on the second ring.

“I got another drawing,” I said.

A pause. Then: “Me too.”

My chest tightened. “What did it say?”

“Nothing. Just a picture this time. But the spiral was carved into the sun.”

That silenced us both.

After a moment, she asked, “Do you think it’s children?”

“I think it’s anyone who listens.”

“Do we stop them?”

I didn’t answer right away.

“I think we try.”

We made a plan, the kind two people make when they know it won’t matter, but need to believe it might. We would write everything down—every detail we remembered—and then destroy it. We would each take turns holding onto memory, passing it back and forth like a loaded weapon, never both remembering at the same time.

A kind of watch.

Not to guard the orchard.

But to keep it from rooting in us.

I buried the small stone behind the barn that night. Not in a box. Not with salt. Just deep, beneath a heavy rock that wouldn’t move without effort. No spiral. No marker. I didn’t say a word while doing it. Just shovel, dirt, silence.

When I finished, I stood still for a long time, until the wind returned.

The orchard swayed gently.

As if nodding.

As if saying:

“Good. But not enough.”

Chapter Seven: The Watchers

The rain returned in September, heavy and slow, soaking the orchard soil in long sips. It darkened the trunks, made the apples shine like lanterns caught in a storm. I watched the weather from the porch most evenings, rocking slowly in my father’s chair, the one with the cracked armrest and the loose leg that never fully settled. The house smelled like damp wood and memory, the kind of scent that clings to your clothes even after you leave.

Each morning, I’d wake and check the perimeter of the orchard. I don’t know what I expected to find. Tracks. Burned grass. Something left behind. What I found instead were impressions—shapes in the earth where something had stood, something too still to be animal, too purposeful to be random. Once, I found an arrangement of stones, flat and pale, stacked in a ring no larger than a dinner plate. Another time, an apple with a single bite taken out, left balanced on the split oak’s lowest branch.

Small things. Harmless, if I believed in such things.

But I didn’t anymore.

Molly and I spoke weekly now. Not about the past. We’d learned our lesson there. No retelling. No shaping memory into something that could be shared or mistaken for narrative. Instead, we talked about what was. Simple, factual. A drawing appeared. A noise under the floorboards. A book fell from a shelf with no wind or hands to help it. She lived in Washington now, far from the orchard. But distance didn’t seem to matter anymore. The story had legs. It walked. It chose its listeners carefully.

“I had a dream,” she told me one night in late September. “Not about the orchard. About a classroom. I was ten again. The teacher asked me to draw a place I loved. I drew the gate.”

My stomach clenched.

“I think I dreamed the same thing,” I said.

Silence.

Then: “We need to stop talking.”

I didn’t argue. I agreed. We said goodbye. The kind that’s supposed to be temporary but never really is.

A few days later, I received a package in the mail.

No return address.

Inside was a tape recorder. Old. Clunky. The kind you pressed a button on with a satisfying click. No batteries. Just the tape already inside. A yellow Post-it stuck to its side read: Play once. Then destroy.

I stared at it on the table for an hour before giving in.

The voice that spoke was mine.

Not exactly, but close enough to make me sweat.

It was older. Slower. The syllables dragged like someone walking uphill.

“Day one hundred and twelve. The door hasn’t opened again. But I think something else has. There’s a shape in the orchard now. Not a person. Not quite. It doesn’t move when I look at it. Only when I forget to. I tried to name it. That was a mistake. Names are too close to stories. I keep thinking about Eli. Not him exactly. The space where he used to be.”

A pause. Breathing. The shuffle of a chair.

“I’ve stopped writing things down. I think maybe the words are what it wants. The permanence. The way a story stays even after the person who told it is gone. Maybe that’s all the orchard is now—a graveyard of stories.”

Click.

The tape ended there. No rewind. No second side.

I burned it that night.

Didn’t watch the plastic melt. Just let it blacken in the pit behind the barn and walked away.

The orchard stayed still.

But not quiet.

I began to hear whispering—not words, not voices. Just the soft sibilance of thoughts forming. Sometimes it came from the trees. Sometimes from the walls. Once, I heard it from the mirror in the upstairs hallway. I stopped using that mirror. Draped a sheet over it. Some things don’t need to be seen twice.

Then came the child.

I saw him first from the window.

Standing just at the edge of the orchard. Facing the house.

He didn’t move.

Didn’t call out.

Just stood, staring.

I watched for nearly ten minutes, not breathing, barely blinking.

Then I turned away to get my boots.

When I returned to the window, he was gone.

No tracks.

No sign he’d ever been there.

But the next morning, a note was pinned to the front door. Same nail. Same paper.

This one read: “You still remember. That’s enough.”

The spiral was smaller this time, drawn in pencil. Smudged in the corners, as if erased and redrawn several times.

I didn’t burn it.

I folded it once, twice, and slipped it into the drawer where my father used to keep old receipts and worn-out keys.

I thought about calling Molly.

Didn’t.

Instead, I returned to the split oak.

Beneath its roots, just shallow enough to disturb with a boot heel, was a new carving.

Three letters.

S. W. E.

My initials. Eli’s. And one I didn’t recognize.

Maybe it hadn’t been carved. Maybe it had always been there.

The bark around the letters looked older than me.

Maybe older than any of us.

That night, I left the porch light on.

Just in case the boy returned.

The boy came again the following week, just after the first frost painted the orchard with its pale, brittle glaze. I saw him from the kitchen, standing precisely where he had before, just beyond the last row of trees. This time, he was facing away from the house, his head tilted up toward the sky as though listening for something. I didn’t move. I didn’t try to go outside. I simply stood at the window, waiting.

He stayed for an hour.

Then he vanished again.

I checked the orchard after he left, walking the same route I always did, boots crunching over the frost-covered leaves, flashlight bobbing low in the mist. No footprints. No broken branches. But near the hollow tree—which still stood, still silent—I found something that hadn’t been there before.

A door.

Not the door, not the one that led beneath, but a freestanding one. A wooden frame nailed together in hasty, irregular cuts, standing upright with no hinges, no knob. Just a rectangle of warped, white-painted boards with nothing but air behind it. It leaned slightly, and the frost hadn’t touched it.

I walked in a wide arc around it, careful not to cast my shadow through the frame. Superstition, maybe, or instinct. Either way, I didn’t cross in front. I circled slowly, trying to find some reason it would exist. There were no markings. No spiral. No blood, or rope, or iron nails. Just wood. Ordinary. Human-made.

I reached out and touched the edge.

The wood was warm.

I drew my hand back and stepped away.

I didn’t sleep that night. Not deeply. I drifted, rose, drifted again. In those shallow waves of consciousness, I heard the sound of knocking—not on the doors or the windows, but from somewhere inside the house. Not loud. Not urgent. Rhythmic. A pattern. Not asking to be let in, but reminding me it already had been.

By dawn, I’d convinced myself I dreamed it.

Until I went back to the kitchen and found muddy prints across the floor.

Not child-sized this time.

Larger.

Mine.

But not placed the way I walked.

They went from the orchard door to the attic.

Back and forth.

As though I’d been pacing in my sleep.

I didn’t remember leaving bed.

And yet, I couldn’t deny the evidence. My own boots, still wet. The smeared trail across the floor. A leaf caught in the cuff of my jeans that hadn’t been there the night before.

So I checked the attic.

Everything looked the same. Dust thicker now, the sheet still over the mirror. But the chair in the corner had moved again. This time, it faced the attic door. And in its seat was a piece of paper.

The same yellowed construction paper as before.

A stick figure. Two eyes. No mouth. Holding a key.

Next to it: the spiral. Faint, almost hesitant, like the hand that drew it wasn’t sure it should.

And below: “Some stories want to be let out.”

I burned it, but the smoke didn’t rise right. It curled along the ceiling in slow circles, then slid into the corners of the room like it had somewhere to be.

I opened the windows.

Let it escape.

But I knew it hadn’t gone far.

That day, I returned to the freestanding door.

It hadn’t moved. Still leaned at its strange angle. Still didn’t cast a shadow in full sun.

This time, I walked in front of it.

Nothing happened.

I walked through it.

Just grass beneath my boots. Air around me. No shift in temperature. No sound. Nothing.

But when I turned back, the orchard had changed.

Only slightly. The rows weren’t in the same order. The split oak was gone. Replaced by a younger tree, unfamiliar. The house was still visible through the thinning trees—but the roof was wrong. Lower. Sagging.

I stepped back through.

And it returned to normal.

Everything where it should be.

I repeated the process twice more, with the same result.

Step through—slight shift.

Step back—reset.

The third time, I noticed something new.

The boy.

But older.

Not a child now, maybe fifteen, standing further into the distorted orchard, holding something in his hand.

It was my journal.

The one I’d burned.

He smiled when I met his eyes.

Then turned and vanished behind a bend in the trees.

I stepped back through the frame.

And the orchard returned again.

Later that night, I woke to find my hands stained with soot. The kind of stain you get from handling paper that’s been through fire.

The journal I’d burned was gone from memory.

But not from the story.

Not from its memory.

And I began to understand the truth that had haunted the orchard all along.

It wasn’t a place.

It was a mind.

And we were its thoughts.

I stayed away from the freestanding door after that. Not out of fear, exactly, but because I understood now that it wasn’t for me—not in the way I thought. It wasn’t a passage to somewhere, but a symptom. An expression. Like the orchard had started dreaming, and this was the shape its dreams took. The boy—older now—had only confirmed it. The spiral had never been static. It twisted forward. It grew.

I boarded the door over with old barn planks the following day, nailing them crosswise so it no longer resembled a threshold. I didn’t burn it. I didn’t bury it. I simply made it look less like itself. Afterward, I felt a mild pressure in the air, like the orchard holding its breath. But nothing stopped me. The trees stood still. The ground didn’t groan. The silence was not permission, but acceptance.

That was worse.

By October, the days shortened and the nights grew loud again.

Not with whispers. Not with footsteps.

With creaking.

The house had always groaned in cold weather—wood contracting, wind pushing through old seams. But this was different. It came from within. Floorboards shifting when no one stood on them. Doors easing open as if called. One night I woke to the sound of something being dragged slowly across the attic floor. When I checked, nothing was out of place. But I could smell cedar.

It clung to the walls like incense, like something burned too long ago to still be fragrant.

I found more footprints that week.

Not mine. Not the boy’s.

These were barefoot. Wide. Adult-sized. They came from the cellar door and stopped at the foot of my bed. I followed the trail the next morning and discovered them again out by the barn, this time circling the old well where the rope had long since frayed to threads.

And always—always—the spiral.

Drawn on a shed wall in white chalk.

Scratched into the frost on a windowpane.

Formed from fallen twigs in the driveway.

It didn’t matter how many I erased, wiped, broke.

They returned the next day.

One morning I found a message scrawled beside the spiral on the porch railing.

“Memory isn’t enough. We need roots.”

The words were etched deep, not scratched by a tool, but burned in—thin lines charred into the grain like fire had traced the letters one by one. I touched them, and my fingers came away clean. No ash. No soot.

The house was trying to speak.

Or the orchard was using it as a tongue.

Either way, it had learned a new language.

That evening I took out every photograph left in the house. Every image of the land, my father, Eli, the orchard. I sat at the kitchen table and stared at each one. I forced myself to look.

And then I tore them apart.

I fed them, piece by piece, into the stove, watching faces curl, trees blacken, skies collapse into ember. I thought maybe if I erased enough of the past, the present would close back up behind it. That without a trail of memory to follow, the orchard’s mind would forget itself.

But I was wrong.

The next morning, the same photos were back in the drawer.

Pristine.

Untouched.

And in one, the one I hadn’t remembered ever seeing before, was the older boy—me, not me—standing between Eli and my father, all three of us smiling.

In the background, behind a stand of trees, a sliver of white.

A door.

I drove to town that afternoon.

Not for groceries. Not for escape.

I went to the historical society, a squat brick building with dusty shelves and a half-functioning heater. The volunteer behind the desk remembered my name. She brought me records without question. Newspaper clippings. Deeds. Obituaries.

I wasn’t looking for ghosts.

I was looking for patterns.

And I found them.

Every fifteen to twenty years, something strange had been noted in or near Wren Hollow. Small mentions in local columns. A missing hiker. A barn burning down without cause. Children sleepwalking and drawing spirals on chalkboards. Never enough to raise alarms. Never enough to point a finger.

But always there.

Consistent.

In 1959, a report of "unseasonal blooming" in a patch of land behind the Ward farm. In 1976, Eli’s disappearance. In 1992, a boy found at the edge of the orchard speaking a language no one could identify. In 2009, a fire in the woods—reported by one witness as "smoke with no flame."

All of it scattered.

None of it forgotten.

The woman behind the desk watched me scan the pages. She said nothing until I stood to leave.

Then she said, “There’s something in that orchard, isn’t there?”

I paused.

“Yes.”

She nodded once. “It won’t die, you know.”

“I know.”

“But you keep going back.”

“What else would you have me do?”

She didn’t answer. She just looked tired.

Before I left, she handed me an envelope.

“My grandfather worked this desk once,” she said. “Said he was supposed to destroy this. Didn’t.”

Inside was a page from a book I didn’t recognize. Old vellum. Ink faded but legible.

A spiral in the center.

And beneath it:
“When a memory takes root in soil, it grows into something else. A tree. A house. A boy. A name. The only way to stop it is not to forget—
but to never know it in the first place.”

I drove home in silence.

The sky was flat. The sun a dull bruise behind the clouds.

When I got to the orchard, I saw the door again.

The one I’d boarded up.

It was open.

Chapter Eight: The Root and the Mirror

The door stood open, the boards I’d nailed across it split clean through, not torn or pried apart, but broken inward, like something had pushed out from the other side. The wood lay scattered in the grass around the frame, each plank split down the grain, edges darkened with moisture. No wind stirred. No birds sang. The orchard around me was still.

I didn’t approach it at first. I stood at the edge of the clearing and watched the empty rectangle of air, framed in splintered pine, leaning now with the barest angle, as if it had begun to collapse under the weight of its own purpose.

I knew better than to look through.

Instead, I walked a slow circle around it. The grass was flattened in a wide radius, not trampled, but sunken, like it had been weighed down from above. At the very center, behind the frame, the air shimmered faintly—heatless and colorless, like the warping on old film.

Something had come through.

Or was trying to.

I returned to the house before dark and locked every door—not out of belief that locks mattered, but out of habit. Ritual, even. I lit no lamps. I sat in the living room, in my father’s old chair, and listened to the creaks of the house settle into the bones of night.

And eventually, the knock came.

Three soft raps.

Not at the door.

From upstairs.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

A moment later: another knock.

Then footsteps.

Measured. Familiar. Slow.

Crossing from one end of the attic to the other.

Then silence.

In the morning, I climbed the stairs.

Dust coated everything, undisturbed. The mirror was still covered, the chair still turned to the wall. But when I reached the top step, I saw the prints.

Barefoot.

Small.

Leading to the covered mirror.

I didn’t uncover it.

Not yet.

Instead, I returned to the orchard, to the broken door.

It stood as it had the night before, leaning now slightly more than before, as if gravity itself had begun to reject it. But the air beyond was clear. The shimmer gone.

I stepped through.

The orchard changed.

Not drastically. Not visibly. But I knew. The trees weren’t in the same order. The sky was a deeper gray than it had been before. The ground had a slickness to it, not quite wet, not quite dry. I walked in a wide arc, retracing the loop I had memorized from years of tending and pacing.

There were no animal tracks.

No sound.

No wind.

Just the orchard breathing.

And in the middle of it: the boy.

Older now.

My age.

Standing beside a tree that didn’t belong—taller, darker, with bark like coiled rope and a hollow at its center. He looked at me like we had always known each other.

“You’re early,” he said.

I swallowed. “For what?”

“For forgetting.”

I didn’t answer.

He walked to the base of the tree and knelt, brushing away loose soil.

Beneath it was a root.

Black. Glistening.

Pulsing.

“You buried it,” he said. “But you didn’t bury you.”

The ground beneath us vibrated slightly.

“I didn’t want this,” I said.

“You remembered. That’s enough. That’s how it starts.”

The root lifted, like a snake rising from a burrow.

“It doesn’t want your fear,” he continued. “It wants your shape. The way you arrange the story. That’s what keeps it alive.”

He stood, stepping aside so I could see the base of the tree more clearly.

Carved into its trunk, fresh and deep, was a name.

Silas Ward.

Underneath it:
Caretaker.

I took a step back.

The tree groaned.

“You were never its victim,” he said. “You’re its mouth.”

I turned and ran.

The orchard bent around me. Trees leaned, paths twisted. The way back was wrong. Angles curved in ways they shouldn’t. But somehow, I found the door. Still standing. Waiting.

I stepped through.

And the real orchard returned.

Or something close enough.

I didn’t speak for two days.

I didn’t write.

Didn’t move beyond the porch.

I watched the trees.

And I listened.

The knocking didn’t come again.

Neither did the boy.

But I knew what had changed.

I was no longer the watcher.

I was being watched.

And the thing that watched wore my face.

The next letter arrived in late October, just before the frost turned hard. No return address. No note inside. Just a photograph.

Black and white.

The house, viewed from a distance. My house.

Taken from deep inside the orchard.

In the upper window, behind the attic curtain, a face.

Mine.

But smiling.

Too wide.

Too still.

Behind it, on the glass, the spiral.

I burned the letter, but kept the envelope.

It smelled faintly of cedar and dust.

The smell of old roots.

The smell of memory left too long in dark soil.

I kept the envelope in the drawer beside my bed, not because I needed it, but because I had begun to accept that some parts of the story were past denial. Every time I tried to destroy a piece of it—paper, object, thought—it found a new way to come back, usually quieter than before. It wasn’t rage. It wasn’t punishment. It was reminder. The orchard, or the thing that lived in it, did not scream to be heard. It whispered to be remembered.

I began to see myself in strange places. Reflections, mostly. Not always mirrors. The back window of my truck when I walked past it in the dark. The stovetop when the overhead light caught the glass just right. Even in the polished shine of a doorknob or the well of a spoon. Always the same face. My face. But not quite. The tilt of the head was wrong. The mouth always a little too still. The eyes never blinking.

One afternoon I caught my reflection in the hallway mirror—the one I had covered weeks ago—and realized the sheet had been pulled down. I hadn’t done it. But the mirror was uncovered nonetheless. I approached slowly, half expecting to see someone else looking back.

But it was just me.

Still, something about the reflection was… inverted. Not mirrored. Opposite. My left hand moved when I raised my right. The details were perfect. Every wrinkle, every scar. Except for one.

In the mirror, there was a small spiral etched into my neck just below the collarbone.

I touched the spot on my own skin.

Nothing there.

But in the glass, the mark pulsed once—like something breathing just beneath the surface.

I covered the mirror again and nailed the sheet in place.

That night, I slept in the truck.

Not because I felt safer there. Just further away.

The first snow arrived early in November. It came fast, as if the sky was hurrying to cover something before I could notice it. Within a few hours, the orchard looked clean again. White and unmarked. The trees stood silent, their limbs skeletal and draped in soft coats of frost. For a brief time, it looked like any other orchard in the hills of Vermont. Ordinary. Almost beautiful.

I walked it just after dawn, boots crunching through the thin crust of snow. I looked for signs. Prints. Symbols. Anything out of place.

At the center of the orchard, where the door had once stood, I found a hole.

Just wide enough for a person to slip through.

It hadn’t been dug. It hadn’t been blasted or torn. The snow around it had melted in a perfect circle, and the earth inside was packed, cold, and smooth.

There was no ladder.

No light.

Just the smell of cedar and stone.

I didn’t climb down.

Not yet.

Instead, I walked back to the house, hands trembling, the cold forgotten.

I opened the old trunk in the attic. The one my father had never let me touch.

Inside were notebooks. Dozens. Maybe more. Some in his hand. Some in another—my grandfather’s, I guessed. Some in a looping cursive I didn’t recognize at all. Each one filled with short entries. Observations. Dreams. Rituals.

But one page stood out.

Folded at the very back of the trunk, wrapped in waxed cloth, sealed with a thread of hair.

I undid it carefully.

It was a map. Not of the land. Not of the orchard.

A map of the house.

Every floor. Every crawlspace. Every beam and nail.

And beneath the cellar, a space that had no door.

A circle drawn in ink so dark it looked wet.

Beside it, a single word.

“Echo.”

That night, the lights in the house flickered and went out.

I lit candles. I stayed awake.

Somewhere between midnight and dawn, I heard a sound from beneath the floorboards.

Not knocking.

Not footsteps.

A voice.

Mine.

“I’m still down here.”

The floor creaked once, sharply.

Then silence.

I’ve begun to write again, but not for memory. Not for record. I write because something in me won’t stop shaping it. The spiral is not just a symbol. It is a rhythm. A path inward. I’ve tried to break the pattern, to step outside it, but every effort folds back in.

Like this:

I try to forget, and the forgetting reminds me.

I bury the seed, and the soil gives birth.

I close the door, and the house grows another.

I look away, and the orchard turns its face toward mine.

I remember, and it listens.

I remain, and it grows.

I speak, and the roots tremble.

I write this now, knowing it won’t stay here. That the words will find their way into another hand, another throat, another memory.

Because this is how it survives.

Not by force.

But by story.

I didn’t descend into the hole right away. I told myself it was because I wasn’t prepared, that I needed light, rope, a plan. But the truth was simpler and harder: I didn’t want to know what waited down there, because I already did. Not in words or memories, but in my bones. The shape of the hole had matched something I’d dreamed years ago—a ring of roots, dark earth, and a low ceiling that pressed against my shoulders like a hand. I’d woken from that dream gasping, convinced my lungs were full of soil.

Three days passed.

Snow fell again. The hole stayed clear.

On the fourth morning, I stood at its edge with a lantern in one hand and a length of rope in the other. I tied the rope to the base of the nearest tree and lowered it until I felt tension, then I climbed down.

The descent was shorter than I expected. Ten feet, maybe twelve. The air below was still and cold, but not frozen. My boots landed on solid earth, packed tight, the surface slightly curved like I was standing in a bowl. I turned in a slow circle, letting the lantern cast its yellow glow.

The space was round, maybe twelve feet across, the ceiling low enough I had to stoop. Roots wove overhead like rafters, curling in unnatural patterns that pulled the eye in spirals and arcs. In the center of the room was a stone slab.

And on it: another box.

Cedar again. The same make as the one my father left me. But newer. No rust. The clasp intact.

I hesitated before touching it.

I had the sense that something would notice.

Still, I opened it.

Inside was a mirror.

Small, oval, set in a frame of bone-white wood.

It reflected the light of the lantern perfectly.

But not me.

In its surface, I saw the orchard.

Not as it was.

But as it had been.

Springtime. Full bloom. Birds in the branches. A younger version of my father walking through the rows, calling a name I couldn’t hear. Then another figure—smaller. A child running behind him.

Eli.

Then, behind them both, a shape.

Vague. Towering. Made of bark and shadow and limbs that reached in too many directions.

The image flickered.

Shifted.

And I saw myself.

Not watching.

But leading.

I dropped the mirror.

It didn’t break.

I closed the box.

Climbed out.

I didn’t look back.

Back in the house, I lit every lamp and pulled every curtain. I turned on the television for the first time in months. Static. Every channel. The antenna on the roof hadn’t worked in years, but I kept trying. I needed sound, something louder than my thoughts. Something that didn’t listen when I spoke to myself.

I found my way into the cellar not long after.

Not by plan.

The door was open one morning. The salt line I’d laid there years before was gone. No trace of white. No disturbance. Just… gone.

I took the lantern. Descended slowly.

The cellar hadn’t changed. The jars were still on the shelf. The shelves still bowed under their weight. The dirt floor still uneven.

But the far wall had a crack.

Vertical. Clean. From floor to ceiling.

And from within it, a breeze.

Warm.

Not the warmth of spring or fire.

The warmth of breath.

I turned and left without touching it.

Nailed the door shut.

Covered it with furniture.

It groaned behind the wood for the rest of the night.

Not loud.

Just constant.

Like breathing.

Letters came again. Three in one week. No return address. All typed.

The first said:

“The orchard was never a place. It’s a thought you stepped inside.”

The second:

“We are what remembers us. If no one forgets you, you never go away.”

And the third:

“Tell no one. Speak no more. Or you become the door again.”

I burned them.

But I knew it didn’t matter.

I had already told the story too many times.

Had shaped it into something someone else might carry.

Molly had sent a voicemail the week before. I hadn’t listened to it until now.

Her voice was tired.

“I tried to burn the drawings again. They wouldn’t catch. They folded instead, like they were becoming something else. I think… I think one of them had my face.”

She paused.

“I don’t think it ever leaves. It just waits for someone to open the right kind of silence.”

Then nothing.

I called her back.

No answer.

Her line had been disconnected.

So here I am.

Alone in a house that once belonged to my father, in an orchard that no longer sleeps, writing in a journal I will soon destroy, about a story that refuses to be unspoken.

The spiral has begun to appear on my skin. Faint, pale lines just below the surface. Like veins turning inward. I don’t scratch at them. I don’t look too closely. I pretend they aren’t there. But I know.

I know.

There’s a story forming in me now. Not mine.

Not yet.

But soon.

The orchard needs a voice again.

And it has chosen one.

It was in the early hours of a windless morning that I awoke to the sound of my own voice. Not from my mouth, but from somewhere below the floorboards. I lay still, heart hammering in my ribs, listening to the cadence—familiar, calm, the way I spoke when I was younger. It wasn’t whispering. It wasn’t calling out. It was telling. Telling a story I knew because I had lived it.

I slid from the bed and crept across the room, careful not to let the floor creak beneath my steps. My ear pressed to the cool wood of the floor, and there it was again: my voice, narrating the first day I’d found the key, the box, the letter from my father. But not as I remembered saying it. There was no fear. No confusion. Just clarity, like someone reading from a finished manuscript.

I stood and walked to the attic. Not because it made sense, but because that’s where the story always seems to circle back to. The mirror was still covered, still nailed beneath the dusty sheet. The air was tight up there, dry and thick. But I noticed a sound—a soft ticking, like an old watch that had begun to run again.

I reached for the mirror.

I didn’t uncover it.

I only touched the fabric.

And beneath my palm, the ticking stopped.

I turned back, heart pounding, but the attic was still.

Then I saw it.

Carved into the chair’s backrest—the one that had faced the mirror for months now—were the words: “Look when it forgets you.”

I don’t know what that means. I still don’t.

But I know it’s waiting.

The orchard has begun to bloom again, though the calendar says it shouldn’t. Late November, and there are blossoms—pink and white and trembling—in the upper branches of the same trees that should be bare. There is no sound of bees. No scent. Just bloom.

Each morning I find more petals on the ground, forming spirals in the dirt.

I no longer walk the orchard at night.

Not because I’m afraid—fear feels too clean for what this is.

It’s something else.

Recognition, maybe. Or resignation.

I’ve become part of it. Not the seed. Not the soil.

The root.

I feel it when I breathe now.

The rhythm of the spiral matching the rhythm of my pulse.

Sometimes I wake to find my hands covered in dirt.

Once, I found a single apple on the kitchen table.

Perfect.

Glossy.

Unpicked.

I threw it in the fire.

It didn’t burn.

It just hissed.

The cellar wall split wider last night. The crack now yawns open enough to reveal a narrow corridor of packed earth sloping downward. I haven't gone in. Not yet. But I feel it pulling.

Not like a threat. Like gravity. Like the inevitability of old footsteps retraced.

I know what lies at the end.

Another mirror.

Or something worse: a version of me that stayed behind when I first passed through the hollow tree.

The one who never came back.

Sometimes I feel him dreaming in the walls.

I try not to write his name.

But it comes anyway.

Silas.

The one I buried.

The one I replaced.

The one who remembers everything I tried to forget.

He watches now, through reflections and glass, through stories told out loud.

He is the witness.

And soon, he will be the one telling the story again.

So this is what I leave behind:

Not a warning.

Not a confession.

A tether.

If you’ve read this far, it’s already taken hold.

Not because of belief.

Not because of ritual.

Because you listened.

Because you carried the shape of the story far enough to understand its rhythm.

That’s all it ever needed.

It doesn’t want a place.

It wants pattern.

And we, foolish beings that we are, we give it willingly.

Through bedtime stories.

Through whispered family secrets.

Through locked drawers and old boxes and names scratched into attic beams.

Through memory.

And now, through you.

The spiral blooms again.

And I am nearly done.

My mouth has gone quiet, but my hands still move.

Words still take shape.

The orchard is in bloom, and the house no longer sleeps.

The voice beneath the floor now matches mine, syllable for syllable.

It no longer tells what was.

Only what will be.

And when I am gone—when I am root and not voice—someone else will sit in this chair, listening to the quiet creak of the house, wondering why the attic always feels colder than it should.

They’ll find the story.

Or it will find them.

The result is the same.

The orchard remembers.

And the spiral never forgets.

Chapter Nine: The Keeper Beneath

It snowed for three days straight. Not in drifts or blizzards, but a steady, patient fall—thick flakes that muted everything, that weighed the world down in soft, white memory. By the second day, the orchard was a cathedral of silence. The blossoms had vanished again beneath the white. The petals, the spirals, the signs—they were gone, or buried, which amounted to the same thing. And on the third morning, I awoke to find the cellar door open.

Not just ajar.

Wide, cleanly, as if waiting.

The furniture I’d stacked against it was moved without sound. The nails I’d driven into the frame were still whole, the wood unbroken. And just beyond the threshold, a dim golden glow pulsed from beneath the floor like a heartbeat.

There were no more choices.

Not really.

The corridor behind the broken wall was longer now. Wider. The roots overhead had pulled back like a curtain, leaving a passage packed with damp earth and the soft odor of mold and cedar. I carried no lantern. I didn’t need one. The glow came from below—from the floor itself, where threads of light pulsed just under the surface, winding like veins toward a deeper chamber.

And when I reached it, I understood.

There was no center.

Only recursion.

A chamber with walls that curved inward forever. Roots spiraled not around but through the space, and at the heart of it—floating just above the ground—was the mirror.

The same shape. The same pale frame.

But massive now.

As tall as me, wider than any doorway in the house.

And in it—reflected clearly, impossibly—was the orchard.

Not in winter.

But in bloom.

There were no people. No birds. No wind. Just a stillness too perfect to be natural.

And in the middle of that orchard stood a boy.

Then a man.

Then me.

I stepped closer, and the image rippled.

I saw every version of myself I had ever been—child, teen, man, boy again. And all of them stood beneath the same tree. Not the hollow one. Not the split oak. A new tree. Or maybe one I had never allowed myself to see.

Its trunk was covered in eyes.

Closed.

But restless beneath the lids.

The mirror pulsed, and I heard a voice—not through ears, but in the soil of my bones.

“Speak, and become.”

I said nothing.

Not yet.

It pulsed again.

“Remember, and root.”

And again.

“Forget, and bloom.”

The spiral formed on the glass—not carved, not drawn, but grown, like frost from the center outward, until it filled the entire pane.

And then the mirror went dark.

I stood in the black, the only sound my own breathing.

But even that began to change.

It wasn’t just mine anymore.

The breath rose from the ground, from the walls, from the wood and the roots and the echo of voices long since buried.

Eli.

My father.

The child from the orchard.

Molly.

Others I didn’t know.

All layered, all speaking in unison.

“Tell it again.”

“Tell it differently.”

“Tell it until it forgets itself.”

I turned and left.

Not in defiance.

But in understanding.

The spiral wasn’t asking to be fed.

It was asking to be confused.

To be broken.

To be rewritten.

Back in the house, I found the box again.

The original one.

My father's.

I hadn't seen it in weeks. I'd thought it gone. Burned, maybe. Swallowed by the cellar. But it sat now on the kitchen table, open, the mirror inside perfectly intact.

But the spiral was gone.

Replaced by a single word etched into the glass.

“WAIT.”

I covered it with a cloth and placed it back in the drawer.

And then I began to write.

Not this story.

Not the truth.

But something else.

A lie so complete it might break the rhythm.

A version of events where the orchard died. Where the house burned. Where Eli returned, whole and laughing, and the tree bloomed only once before falling to rot and ash.

I wrote that I moved away.

That the house was sold.

That I never dreamed again.

That the mirror shattered on its own.

That the voice beneath the floor faded.

That the roots shriveled in drought.

That no drawings came in the mail.

That no doors opened.

That the boy grew up and forgot the spiral.

I wrote it in ink and copied it in pencil.

Typed it out.

Printed it.

I buried the pages in seven places: under the hearth, beneath the barn, in the hollow tree, in the well, in the attic crawlspace, beneath the cellar steps, and beneath the mirror in the trunk.

And I whispered it to the orchard itself.

And I waited.

Three nights passed.

Nothing happened.

On the fourth, I dreamt of silence.

No voice.

No spiral.

Just white sky and the sound of snow falling on untouched branches.

The orchard stood still.

And I, for the first time in years, stood outside it.

I don't know if the lie worked.

I don’t know if stories can unmake themselves.

But the mirror remains dark.

The house remains still.

And the breath beneath the floor has quieted.

For now.

But if you are reading this…

If these words have reached you…

Then know: you must forget them.

Burn this page.

Bury the book.

Do not speak of the orchard.

Do not draw the spiral.

Do not look in mirrors after dark.

And above all—

Do not listen to the voice that calls from the roots beneath your home.

Because once you hear it,

It remembers you.

Forever.

The days that followed passed without punctuation. The world felt suspended—no birdsong, no wind through the orchard, no frost on the porch rail. Just a kind of muted continuation. The snow no longer fell. It simply existed, cold and still and smooth. I lived like someone underwater, every movement met with resistance. My hands ached when I tried to write. The pen stuttered, ink skipping across the page like the words themselves didn’t want to be formed.

I began to dream less, or if I dreamed, I stopped remembering. I would wake with my heart hammering and nothing in my mind but a sense of having been seen. Not watched—seen. Known, in the way trees know sunlight and shadows. In the way a room remembers the shape of furniture long after it’s gone.

One morning, I opened the front door and found a trail of footprints in the snow leading away from the porch and out into the orchard. Not child-sized. Not adult. Something in between. The gait was uneven, the impressions shallow, as though whoever—or whatever—had left them hadn’t been entirely part of this world. They led in a slow, meandering path between the trees, doubling back, looping, spiraling once—always once—and finally disappearing beneath the roots of the hollow tree.

The door was gone. The boarded frame had collapsed into itself and vanished without a mark. Only the spiral remained, carved into the bark of the tree and filled with packed snow.

I placed my palm against the mark.

It pulsed once, warm beneath the cold.

And then, for the first time, I felt it withdraw.

Not vanish. Not break.

Withdraw.

As though the thing behind it had grown tired. Or perhaps satisfied.

I returned to the house, unsure whether I should feel relief or dread.

That night, I found the last note on my bedside table. Typed, no envelope. The paper smelled faintly of pine sap and iron.

It read:

“The orchard doesn’t need to win. It only needs to be remembered. You have given it years. Give it silence now.”

I didn’t burn it.

I folded it and slipped it into the notebook I once swore I’d never open again.

Then I packed a bag.

Nothing large—just a few clothes, a canteen, the photo of Eli and I as children, smiling in a summer too far gone to matter. I locked the front door behind me, even knowing how useless it was. I left the mirror wrapped in its cloth in the attic. I left the cellar sealed. I left the orchard as it was.

And I walked away.

There was no destination in my mind, only the act of movement.

Distance, I had come to understand, was not a remedy. But it might be a mercy.

For myself, if not for whatever came next.

I write this now from a borrowed room in a borrowed town, far from Wren Hollow, far from the roots that once held me in their grip. The snow falls differently here. There are no orchards, no hollow trees, no spirals carved into the corners of windows.

But I still see them.

Sometimes in the way paint peels from an old church door.

Sometimes in the grain of a cutting board.

Once in the way a child absentmindedly traced his finger in spilled sugar on a diner table.

It’s always subtle. Always passing.

And always followed by stillness.

The orchard doesn’t need land.

It needs memory.

It needs shape.

And people—fragile, curious, full of hunger for stories—are the perfect soil.

So I will speak no more of the orchard.

Not in truth. Not in metaphor.

I will bury it in silence, not hoping it dies, but hoping it forgets me.

Hoping I become just another rootless whisper in the dirt.

If you found this, destroy it.

You have already read too far.

Do not trace the spiral in the margins.

Do not imagine the hollow tree.

Do not remember the boy.

Do not carry this story to anyone else.

Let it die in you, quietly, like a seed that never breaks ground.

Because the orchard is always listening.

And now it knows your name.

I spent the first week away from the house in a small roadside motel outside of Rutland. The sort of place built for overnight truckers and families on forgotten vacations, with wallpaper that peeled at the corners and beds that dipped in the center. No one asked my name. No one cared how long I stayed. I paid in cash. I kept the television on, volume low, a steady murmur that kept silence at the edges. Each night I told myself I was done. That the spiral had stopped spinning. That the orchard had, at last, gone quiet.

But something followed.

Not in form. Not in shadow. In pattern.

I started to see it in the way the motel carpet curled where the vacuum missed. In the clusters of birds overhead, circling before dusk. In the way coffee grounds settled in the bottom of the paper cup, always, inexplicably, in a slow turn inward.

The world had picked up a rhythm I could no longer unsee.

And every time I noticed it, I heard my name.

Soft.

Whispered.

Carried on the sound of passing trucks, in the sigh of the vent above the bathroom mirror.

“Silas.”

Once, I heard it inside the hum of the vending machine.

I pressed my ear to the plastic and it stopped.

The silence was worse.

On the eighth day, I checked out.

I didn’t say goodbye to the clerk. I didn’t pack carefully. I left half my things behind. Just picked up my bag and walked out into the cold morning with no clear direction.

I wandered. First west, then north, until roads stopped having names and the map no longer seemed to apply. I ate from gas stations. Slept in the cab of an abandoned pickup I found in a field. Time blurred. Snow came and went.

And always, the spiral followed.

Not drawn.

Just… present.

In trees.

In wind.

In absence.

I tried writing again—new stories, new places, new names—but they curved in on themselves, always. No matter the beginning, they returned to the orchard. The boy. The door. The mirror. My voice.

It was as though I had become a wellspring for the memory, and now every word I spoke, every image I conjured, watered the root again.

So I stopped writing.

I stopped speaking aloud.

I practiced forgetting.

Then, one night in early December, I came to a clearing I didn’t recognize. No roads. No signs. Just an old church, long-abandoned, leaning to one side as if the trees around it had grown tired of holding it up. The bell tower was missing. The windows broken. But inside, the pews remained. Dust-covered. Whole.

And in the place where an altar once stood, there was a chair.

Simple.

Wooden.

Empty.

I didn’t want to sit in it.

But I did.

The silence pressed in, deep and old.

And after a time, I heard footsteps.

Soft.

Measured.

From behind me.

But when I turned, there was no one.

Only the spiral, carved faintly into the floorboards, right beneath my feet.

Not glowing.

Not fresh.

Just there.

I stood.

And something pulled.

Not physically. Not even psychically.

Something in the shape of the moment, as if I’d stepped into a version of the story already told—and in this version, I was meant to stay.

I left the church.

That night, I slept beside a river, and for the first time in months, I didn’t dream.

Now, I have settled in a small town in the north, near the border where the map fades into forest and frost. The people here are quiet. The winters are long. The air smells of pine and smoke.

No one knows my name.

I work in a salvage yard, stripping metal from things no one remembers. I live above a closed-down hardware store. There is a single window that looks out onto nothing.

And still, sometimes, when I turn off the lights at night, I see a shape in the dark.

Not a figure.

Not a monster.

Just a curve.

The beginning of a spiral.

Waiting.

Not to be seen.

But to be told.

If you have read this far, it’s too late.

You have walked the path.

You have felt the curve.

And the orchard, wherever it now grows, has already begun to root in the hollow places of your memory.

You will not see it coming.

But one day, you’ll speak of a tree that bloomed out of season.

You’ll dream of a boy with too-wide eyes.

You’ll hear a voice behind the mirror.

And you will remember me.

You will remember yourself.

And the spiral will turn again.

Chapter Ten: The Orchard Elsewhere

I don’t know what finally pulled me back.

Maybe it was a letter. Maybe it was silence. Maybe it was that I had lived too long in someone else’s forgetting.

But one morning, I woke and the snow outside had melted—not all of it, just a circle. Six feet wide. Damp earth and brittle grass exposed in perfect clarity, as though some warm shape had rested there all night and slipped away before dawn.

I hadn’t dreamed. I hadn’t seen spirals in weeks.

But I knew what it meant.

The orchard had found me again.

And not in memory, not in dreams.

In place.

The spiral doesn’t need trees. It doesn’t need seeds. It needs recognition. A shape repeated enough times to wear a groove into the fabric of thought, and then deeper—into behavior, into instinct.

Into geography.

That morning, I walked out of the apartment, past the rusting tools in the yard and the snow-hardened fenders of the cars waiting to be stripped. No one stopped me. No one looked up. I walked north, out of the town, into the woods.

And after three hours, I saw them.

The trees.

Not the same as before. Different species. Fewer limbs. But the layout was familiar. A shape I could have walked blindfolded. The rows were uneven, but they turned, subtly, inward.

And at the center: a clearing.

At the center of that: a rock.

Not split.

Whole.

And resting atop it: a single apple.

Glossy.

Too perfect.

I didn’t touch it.

I didn’t need to.

Instead, I sat down at the edge of the clearing and waited.

Not for a voice. Not for a sign.

For memory.

And after some hours, it came.

I remembered the last time I saw Eli. Not in the orchard. Not in dreams. But in our grandmother’s attic, the summer before he vanished. We’d found an old box of papers—letters, receipts, photographs with corners chewed by mice. There’d been a map drawn on the back of a grocery list. Not of the town. Not even of the land.

A map of stories.

Eli had traced the lines with one finger, following the looping path to the center.

“What’s this?” I’d asked.

“Where the stories go when they’re done,” he’d said.

I had laughed. But he hadn’t.

He’d folded the paper carefully and tucked it into his pocket.

And later that week, he was gone.

I’d forgotten that moment for decades.

But now, in this clearing—this other orchard—I remembered it in full.

And I understood.

There was no one orchard.

Just the story that keeps appearing as one.

Different soil. Different trees.

Same spiral.

Same invitation.

That night, I returned to the town.

I slept deeply.

Dreamlessly.

And in the morning, the apple was gone.

The clearing was still there.

But something had shifted.

I hadn’t taken the offering.

I had remembered it.

But I hadn’t shaped it again.

The spiral had no new groove to wear.

And maybe that was enough.

I’ve begun writing again.

Nothing grand.

Notes on paper. Scribbles. Observations.

Each one ends with a single word: stop.

Not because I believe I can undo what’s been done.

But because even stories must pause to breathe.

And sometimes, stillness is resistance.

If you find yourself dreaming of trees you don’t recall planting—

If you see a child staring at your house from the road, unmoving—

If the mirror shows you blinking when you haven’t moved—

Don’t run.

Don’t bury it.

Don’t speak.

Forget with intention.

Let the spiral spin itself out with no one at the center.

Let the orchard bloom where no one sees.

And in that silence, you might find a path out.

Or at least… a way to remain your own.

I spent the next weeks in a kind of waking suspension, neither wholly here nor entirely gone. Days passed with a predictable, almost artificial smoothness—routines unbroken, sky pale and unchanging, meals tasteless but sufficient. I worked. I nodded when spoken to. I slept with a knife under my pillow, though I no longer believed it could protect me from the thing I feared most: the re-shaping. The slow, creeping reassertion of pattern.

I began to catalog the small changes. Not actively. I didn’t write them down—not yet—but I noted them all the same.

First, the crows. Dozens of them, circling the rooftops. They didn’t call. They didn’t land. They just circled, forming loops that narrowed each morning.

Second, the girl in the post office who drew something in the condensation on the glass door while her mother spoke to the clerk. A curve. Then a second. And then a spiral. She wiped it away before anyone saw, but I was already backing out the door.

Third, the man in the salvage yard with the blackened fingertips who claimed he dreamed in roots. Not visions, he said. Structures. Tangled, repeating shapes that pulsed under his skin. He didn’t remember telling me this. I tried asking twice. The third time, he just stared at me like I’d said something obscene.

I knew these were breadcrumbs. Not laid by the orchard—but by memory itself, creeping back under the door I’d only just learned to keep closed. The story, even now, was finding new mouths to grow in.

So I did the only thing I could.

I left again.

Not far. Just beyond the edge of the town. Into the woods. Into the cold. Into the stillness.

And I waited.

Three days passed before the snow came.

And with it, the clearing again.

No apple this time.

Only the rock.

The spiral was carved into it now—clean, recent, wet around the grooves as if etched in the hour before I arrived.

And across the ground: footprints.

Dozens.

All different sizes.

Leading to the rock.

None leading away.

I stood at the edge, heart hammering, lungs full of air too thin, too sharp. Every instinct told me to run. But instinct, I had learned, was a muscle trained by the spiral too. Flight, fight, freeze—they were all versions of the same response: participation.

So I did nothing.

I stood.

I watched.

And after a while, the clearing darkened—not from cloud or night, but from shadow.

Something enormous passed overhead, blotting out the sky for the briefest moment.

No sound.

Just a weight in the air.

Then gone.

And I understood.

The spiral had grown.

Grown beyond my orchard. Beyond Wren Hollow. Beyond names and trees and soil.

It had become idea.

And ideas, once rooted, do not die.

When I returned to town, I expected it to be changed.

It wasn’t.

Not visibly.

People still shoveled snow. Still drank coffee and gossiped about potholes and power outages. But I saw the pattern in them now. Small loops. Repetitions. A woman tying and retying the same scarf. A man locking and unlocking his car four times before walking away. A child counting backward aloud from thirteen, again and again.

The story was threading through them already.

Maybe it always had been.

I watched.

And I kept silent.

At night I hear a sound outside my window.

Not a whisper.

Not a voice.

Just breathing.

Soft and slow.

Perfectly matched to mine.

I don’t look.

I don’t move.

Because some stories, if you acknowledge them, will never stop telling themselves.

And some doors, once opened, do not close behind you.

They follow.

There is no end to the orchard.

There is no edge where memory drops off.

There is only the moment before the story begins, and the moment you realize it's already begun.

And if you’ve read this far—

Then it has begun again.

In you.

The sound began to follow me indoors.

It was subtle at first—a shifting weight in the attic overhead, the faint rasp of something settling between walls, as though the house itself were breathing. I tried to explain it away. Houses settle, especially in winter. Pipes hum, boards contract. But this wasn’t structural. This was rhythmic. A breath matched to mine, yes—but sometimes a half-second ahead, as though anticipating. As though teaching.

I stopped going to work. The salvage yard didn’t miss me. The man with the root dreams disappeared a few days later, and no one mentioned him. His trailer sat dark and sagging, the snow around it undisturbed. I watched it from my window, half-expecting the door to creak open in the night and someone—not him—walk out.

No one did.

But the breathing never stopped.

On the sixth night, I lit a fire in the stove and turned all the lights on.

It didn’t help.

The breathing only seemed to thicken, wrapping the edges of my thoughts in a slow, damp fog. I tried playing music. It warped the sound, bent the melody inward. A single lyric would stretch and repeat itself beneath the chorus until I couldn’t tell what had been sung and what had been added.

I smashed the speaker.

It didn’t change anything.

The next morning, a package arrived. No name, no label, only twine tied in a bow that had been frayed at the edges by long handling. I didn’t open it at first. I set it on the kitchen counter and circled it every hour or so, waiting for a shift in air or temperature, some invisible cue that it was safe. None came.

I opened it that evening.

Inside: a book.

Hardbound. Roughly made.

No title.

No publisher.

Just a blank cover and a spine creased by time.

I flipped it open.

The pages were filled with handwriting.

Not mine.

Not my father’s.

But familiar.

I read the first sentence:

“He woke to find the orchard blooming, though no one remembered planting the trees.”

The words hit like a bell in my ribs.

I kept reading.

Each page told a version of the story I’d lived—but wrong. Twisted. Names shifted, roles reversed. In one, Eli was the one who returned. In another, I was never born. In one chapter, I was the orchard itself, watching others walk my rows.

The spiral, always present.

On the margins.

In the layout.

Even the grain of the paper.

The last page was blank.

Except for a single sentence:

“Write what comes next.”

I threw the book into the stove.

It burned.

But the smell was wrong.

Not paper. Not ink.

Something sweeter.

Like fruit that had rotted, then fermented.

The flame turned green.

Then blue.

Then nothing.

And the stove went cold.

I began to lose time after that.

Not hours. Not days.

Moments.

I would blink and find myself on the porch.

Or halfway through the woods.

I began waking up with soil under my fingernails.

A spiral drawn on the inside of my wrist in faded ink.

Once, I found myself standing at the foot of a tree that wasn’t there the day before.

It was young.

Barely more than a sapling.

But its bark was familiar.

Smooth and pale, like polished bone.

I left and did not return to that place.

I didn’t need to.

I had planted it.

Or something had planted it through me.

Now, I spend my time in silence again.

No music.

No writing.

Only watching.

And listening.

Because I know the orchard hasn’t stopped.

It’s only waiting.

Not to bloom.

Not to whisper.

But to be spoken.

To have its shape named, once again.

Because that’s the final truth of it, isn’t it?

The orchard isn’t a place, or a curse, or a ghost.

It’s a story.

And a story lives only when it’s told.

So I will not tell it anymore.

I will let the pattern fade.

Let the spiral lose its form.

Let memory grow dull around the edges, like a dream that loses heat after waking.

Because if I don't—

If I speak one more time—

I know it will listen.

And worse, it will answer.

It was around midwinter when the town itself began to change—not visibly, not in architecture or population, but in its tone. People grew quieter, but not solemn; they weren’t grieving, they were expectant. Like they’d all heard something at once and didn’t want to admit it. The storekeepers stopped asking for small talk. Children drew more frequently on sidewalks with chalk that never seemed to wash away. At the diner, people stirred their coffee absentmindedly, tracing loops until the liquid turned black and still.

I began to suspect I was no longer the only one carrying it. That the orchard—the idea of the orchard—had infected the rhythm of the town. That maybe it never needed to follow me. Maybe it had already arrived, long ago, and I’d simply been blind to the spread.

One night I passed a window and caught my reflection before I could look away.

It was me, but younger.

He blinked.

I didn’t.

I backed away slowly, heart pounding in a way that no longer felt like fear, but memory returning at full speed. The boy in the reflection smiled—not cruelly, not even knowingly, but with the faint patience of something that had already waited years and could wait centuries more.

I covered the mirror with a bedsheet and did not go near it again.

I started getting visitors.

Not people I recognized.

They would arrive late, knock only once, and stand outside until I answered. Always alone. Always quiet. One would hand me a folded piece of paper, or a page torn from a book, or a photograph that had been burned at the edges.

None of them spoke.

None of them waited for thanks.

One girl—maybe fifteen—left behind a journal wrapped in birch bark. Inside were drawings of trees that looked like bone, spirals made of feathered ash, and a story told entirely backward, beginning with a man turning to dirt and ending with a knock at his door.

Every visitor left something behind.

They never took anything with them.

Not even footprints.

I stayed in bed for three days after the last one came.

Didn’t eat.

Didn’t write.

Didn’t move.

Because I had seen something in the final item.

A photograph, this one older than the others. Folded in half and stained with something that looked like apple juice gone brown. In the image, a man stood in front of a tree. Just one tree. Behind him: endless blank field.

No orchard.

No house.

Just the tree.

But it was unmistakable.

The spiral curled in the bark behind him.

The same one I had drawn.

The same one I had buried.

The same one I had become.

The man in the photo was me.

Or would be.

And in the distance, just barely visible, was the outline of a boy walking away, his face obscured.

Eli.

That was when I accepted it.

There would be no clean severance.

No final act.

No escape.

Because I hadn’t been chosen by the orchard.

I hadn’t even discovered it.

I’d answered it.

It had always been calling, from long before my father, long before Eli, long before the house.

Calling across generations.

Waiting for the one who would tell it right.

Not to end it.

But to keep it alive.

So here, now, at the tail end of winter, with the snow beginning to crust and the thaw just threatening the edges of the hills, I make the last entry I will allow myself.

Not because it ends here.

But because I must.

The spiral doesn’t demand faith.

It demands attention.

A gaze turned inward long enough becomes a path.

And a path, followed long enough, becomes a root.

So I leave this here for whoever comes next.

Not as a warning.

Not even as a history.

But as a seed.

And if you plant it—by reading, by dreaming, by remembering—then you have made your choice.

The orchard is listening.

And now…

so are you.
