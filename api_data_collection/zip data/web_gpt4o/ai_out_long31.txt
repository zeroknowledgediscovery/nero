Whispers of Tansel Wood
Chapter One: The Spark in the Bramble

It was the way the wind moved through the brambles that gave her away. Not by sound, for sprites seldom made any, nor by sight, for even the keenest eyes would miss the slip of her shadow under leaf and thorn. But the breeze—yes, the breeze—stumbled over something just a heartbeat before it reached Old Harnen's boots, and he knew then she was near.

Old Harnen stooped, one knee creaking. He reached out, calloused fingers brushing the edge of a curling fern. “You don’t belong in these woods, little flicker,” he murmured. “But I won’t catch you if you don’t want catching.”

Nothing moved.

Then, just as he stood and turned back toward the mossy trail, a shimmer like frost on fire peeled away from the trunk of a squat ash tree. She flitted—no bigger than a pinecone, glowing with a strange, off-yellow light, flickering oddly as if unsure of what color to wear in the waking world. She trailed sparks like ink dropped into water, dissolving too soon to see clearly.

And she was laughing.

The sprite darted up and around Harnen’s head, looping twice before perching with a flutter of gossamer wings on the rim of his weather-beaten hat. “You walk like a boar with stones in its shoes,” she said, voice chime-like and yet rough around the edges, as though laughter had dulled its tune.

“I walk like a man who knows these woods,” Harnen grumbled, not unkindly. “What are you doing this far from Tansel Hollow, eh? Don’t you know the wards have faded since the Waking?”

The sprite blinked—eyes too large, too green. “Do you mean the old chalk circles? They’ve all been washed away. Rain doesn’t like lines, you know.”

“And you don’t belong here,” he said again.

“But I am here.” She tilted her head, the thin lines of her face catching golden light. “I’ve got a name now.”

“Have you.” He adjusted his hat, and she fluttered up briefly before settling again. “Well then, let’s hear it.”

“Elmira,” she said, though she whispered it like she wasn’t quite sure. “Elmira Briarwhisp.”

Harnen sucked on his teeth. “That’s no name given by the Hollow. Who named you, sprite?”

Elmira didn’t answer. Her light dimmed, just a shade.

The Hollow had long been a secret to men, hidden not by walls but by forgetting. A ring of ancient trees—sycamore, yew, and the ghost-pale ironbirch—encircled a glade where the old magicks still whispered in the moss. It had once thrummed with the breath of a dozen sprites, flitting in and out of the soft-lantern light of their fungus towers, their songs stitched into the wind. But now the Hollow was nearly silent.

Nearly.

Elmira, as she now chose to be called, hovered over the cracked basin of the central glade fountain. The water, once humming with aurora-light, now trickled dully, like it was embarrassed to still be alive. She poked at the surface with a stick.

“I named myself,” she muttered to no one. “Because nobody else did.”

“Names are weight, child,” said a low voice behind her, dry as shed bark. “You wear them long after the world forgets.”

She spun. “Elder Thiln.”

The old sprite, more bark than shimmer, stood hunched under the arc of a curling fern. He didn’t glow; he etched light, as if the shadows tried to pull him into themselves but failed. His wings were torn, one hanging limp.

“You shouldn’t be wandering into the human wood,” he said, hobbling closer. “Their dreams have teeth now. They don't see what we are. They see what they fear.”

“I wasn’t afraid,” she said.

“You should be.”

He reached into the moss and drew forth a thin blade of quartz. It caught no light, but it hummed softly. “There are things waking beyond the Hollow. And you’ve stirred them.”

Elmira frowned. “It was just one old man. He can barely bend without creaking.”

Thiln sighed, the kind of sigh that lives longer than its speaker. “He’s not the danger. But the moment you step beyond the chalk-ring, you become part of their story. And their stories are hungry.”

In the town of Wensgrove, just three days’ march west of the Hollow, a girl named Arlyn stared into a cup of dandelion tea and saw it swirl into the shape of a face. Not a real one—not clearly—but the outline of a cheek, the curl of a smile too wild to be human. She blinked, and it was gone.

“I’m not mad,” she said aloud.

“Hmm?” her brother Gereth looked up from mending a boot.

“I saw something.”

“You always see something.”

“No, really.” She set the cup down. “It looked like someone. Like… a girl, with leaves for hair.”

Gereth frowned. “You’ve been reading Gran’s books again.”

Arlyn didn’t deny it.

Their grandmother had been one of the last wardens of the old lore, keeper of the Songs Without Names and the Rules of Borrowed Fire. She died five winters ago, leaving behind stacks of leather-bound volumes that reeked of mildew and secrets. Their father had tried to burn them once. The flames hadn’t caught.

Now, Arlyn opened the thickest of the tomes again. The one with the pressed acorn on the cover.

“Sprites,” she whispered. “Said to carry the memory of the forest itself. Said to vanish when named. Said to awaken... when the veil weakens.”

She didn’t know why, but her chest ached when she read it. Like something old had turned over in her ribs.

That night, Elmira dreamed of a mountain split by song. A place where music bled from the stones and turned into rivers of light. A throne sat empty at its summit, built from wind and bark and the bones of birds.

In the dream, she sat there. And she burned.

But the fire did not consume. It whispered.

“Elmira,” it said. “You have been named. You have been chosen.”

She woke to the sound of the Hollow breaking.

Trees don’t scream. Not really. But the old ones groan when wounded, and the ironbirch, the eldest of all, cried out that dawn. Something had torn a wound through its bark, leaving black resin oozing like blood.

Thiln stood before it, tiny hand pressed to the trunk. “The wards,” he said. “Gone. The veil... thinner than mist.”

Elmira stepped closer. “I dreamed something.”

Thiln didn’t turn. “You are not ready.”

“I dreamed the throne.”

Now he looked. His eyes, usually dim with moss-glow, widened.

“You saw the Crown of Greenfire?”

She nodded.

He reached into his chest—not metaphorically, but truly, through a small opening in the bark-like plating of his ribs—and pulled out a splinter of goldglass. “Then it’s begun.”

“What has?”

“The Reckoning.”

Meanwhile, deep below Wensgrove, in a cavern no one remembered carving, a man with a crooked lantern stared at a wall of stone and whispered, “She has returned.” He was bald, robed in tatters, and smelled of soil turned over too many times. On the wall, a faint outline—part glyph, part tree, part open mouth—glowed with wet light.

Another voice behind him, this one calm and clear as cut ice, said: “Then we have only three moons left.”

“Three?”

“She lit the branch,” the ice-voice said. “That means the Hollow is bleeding. The sprite has touched the edge.”

The bald man shivered. “So the songs are true.”

“Some,” said the other. “Some are bait.”

The glyph pulsed once. Then again. Then faded.

“Tell the Order,” the voice said. “The Greenfire is rising.”

And far above them, in the quiet sky over the Hollow, a single leaf fell—out of season, against the wind, glowing faintly.

Elmira watched it land beside her foot. She picked it up, and it did not crumble.

It sang.

The song was so faint it could have been imagined, but Elmira knew better. It curled up from the veins of the leaf like threads of memory unraveling, and for a moment she was no longer standing in the Hollow. She was somewhere else—somewhen else—on a ridge where the trees burned with autumn though the air was winter-cold, surrounded by shapes that stood too still to be human. One figure turned, its eyes hollow, its skin carved from petrified ash.

Then she blinked, and it was just a leaf again. Just her, the quiet forest, and Thiln’s face twisted in a way she had never seen—fear and awe, mixed like oil and fire.

“Put it down,” he said quietly. “That leaf was not meant for you.”

“But it came to me.”

“All the more reason to be wary. The forest does not make choices lightly.”

She hesitated, but tucked the leaf into the woven reed pouch that dangled from her belt anyway. Thiln winced.

“That leaf belonged to the last Warden of the Crown. You cannot wear its weight without waking its memory.”

“I didn’t ask for it,” she muttered. “It came to me.”

“And that is worse.”

Far away in the town of Wensgrove, Arlyn dreamt of vines. They crawled from the cracks between her floorboards, writhing in slow, deliberate coils. Her bed lifted with them, tilting as the wooden arms reached for the ceiling. In her dream, the vines whispered her name—each syllable drawn out like a root curling through stone.

When she awoke, her arms were covered in dirt.

She sat bolt upright, brushing soil from her sheets. Her heart thundered. For a long moment, she said nothing. Then she climbed out of bed and pulled Gran’s book from its hiding place under the loose floor plank. It fell open—on its own—to the page she'd read the day before.

“When the root takes hold in flesh, and the veil thins, seek the Crown or be devoured.”

She traced the inked glyph beneath it—a spiral of thorns inside a circle. It looked disturbingly like the pattern her teacup had made.

Downstairs, the morning was soft and grey. Gereth had already left for the tannery, and the hearth smoldered low with last night’s coal. Arlyn slipped on her boots, slung a satchel over her shoulder, and stepped into the mist.

The road to the forest was not one she took often. It wound behind the orchard, through Old Mern’s goat pasture, and disappeared under a low arch of ivy. Gran had once told her the woods beyond weren’t natural. They shifted. Moved.

But Gran had also told her the sprites had vanished long before Arlyn was born.

Yet here she was, walking toward where the trees grew oldest, where her pulse beat louder with every step. As if something beneath her skin remembered a path she herself had never walked.

Elmira perched in the cradle of a drooping bellflower, her wings furled and her thoughts storming. She couldn’t shake the weight of the dream, the singing leaf, or the way Thiln had looked at her like she’d become something alien.

She didn’t feel different. Not really. Her light was the same. Her wings still buzzed faintly when she flexed them. But inside her—deep, in a place even she didn’t know how to name—something throbbed, like a forgotten promise waking up.

The forest around her was restless too. Small things scurried where they shouldn’t. A thistle plant bloomed in mid-spring with black petals. Moss curled backward on itself, showing its pale underbelly to the sky.

Something was wrong with the Hollow.

And with her.

Thiln had withdrawn after their argument, returning to the broken edge of the fountain to whisper his worries to the stones. The other sprites—those that remained—were silent, keeping to their nests in the boughs. Once, Elmira might have climbed and coaxed them out with jokes or tricks. But now… they watched her with wary eyes.

She was becoming other. That much was certain.

Back in Wensgrove, Arlyn reached the edge of the Hollow by accident—or at least, that’s what she told herself. The forest had grown dense, too fast. One minute she was ducking through brambles, and the next, she was standing in a clearing laced with silver mist. It curled around her boots like fingers, gentle but insistent. She could see only a few feet ahead, but she knew—somehow—that she had crossed into somewhere ancient.

She stepped forward, and the mist broke.

Before her rose a stone arch, half-swallowed by roots. In its center shimmered a membrane of air that bent light like glass over water.

She knew what it was without needing to be told: a veil.

Her breath caught. Gran’s book had spoken of these. Gates to other places—between the waking world and the Greenwoven. Between flesh and dream.

Without meaning to, her hand reached out and touched it.

The membrane trembled—once, twice—and then dissolved.

Elmira heard the hum first. A sharp, sudden note that rang through her bones like a plucked wire. She looked up sharply. The glade’s light dimmed, as if a cloud had passed overhead, though the sky remained clear. The air smelled like turning earth and dry parchment.

Thiln appeared beside her, panting. “The veil,” he gasped. “Someone passed through.”

Elmira’s wings flickered. “A sprite?”

He shook his head, his whole frame trembling. “Worse. A human.”

She didn’t wait. She took off.

The trees blurred past as she zipped through the brambles, following the scent of the open gate. It was like chasing a thunderclap—raw power lingered in the branches, in the crackling hush of the undergrowth. The Hollow hadn’t felt this alive in generations.

She found the girl by the old ironbirch—the one that bled.

And the girl… was touching its wound.

“Hey!” Elmira flared, her light blazing bright, her voice sharp. “What do you think you’re doing?”

Arlyn stumbled back, hand flying to her chest. “You’re… real,” she said, as though it was the only thing that mattered.

“Of course I’m real,” Elmira snapped. “You broke the veil.”

“I didn’t mean to. It just—opened.”

“No veil opens unless it wants to,” Elmira said, though she wasn’t sure that was true. She circled the girl, wings buzzing. “What are you?”

“I’m Arlyn. I live in Wensgrove.”

Elmira stared at her. There was something about her—an echo. A half-remembered song. She hovered closer. “Have you been dreaming of vines?”

Arlyn blinked. “Yes.”

“And trees that bleed?”

“Yes.”

Elmira hovered inches from her face. “Then you’re part of this. You’ve been called.”

“By what?”

Elmira didn’t answer. She didn’t know. But her pouch, where the leaf was tucked, had begun to glow.

Elsewhere, in the depths of the moss-choked ruin known only to the Order as the Rootvault, a voice rose in song.

Not melody. Not language.

A pulse.

And all through the ancient forest, every tree leaned ever so slightly toward the Hollow.

Toward the girl who had broken through.

Toward the sprite who bore the Crown’s first ember.

And beneath them, in the deep-black soil, something began to stir.

Something that remembered the old wars.

Something hungry.

Chapter Two: A Root in the Veil

The Hollow had never welcomed humans, not even in the old days when the veil between worlds hung thinner than a spider's breath and sprites danced openly on twilight roads. Now, as Arlyn stood beneath the wounded ironbirch with Elmira’s piercing gaze locked on her every move, the very ground seemed to tremble with unease. The moss had pulled back from her boots, revealing dark, glistening soil that pulsed faintly, like it had a heartbeat of its own. Above, the canopy stirred without wind.

“Don’t move,” Elmira said, her voice low and deliberate. “You’ve already done enough.”

Arlyn frowned. “I didn’t do anything. I was just—”

“You touched the wound,” Elmira interrupted. “That tree is older than Wensgrove. Older than your people’s stories. When its bark bleeds, the world listens. You touched it. Now it knows your name.”

“That’s impossible.”

“And yet here you are.”

The sprite hovered backward, arms crossed, wings slowly pulsing to keep her aloft. Her light had dulled slightly, a muddy hue flickering beneath the surface of her shimmer. Arlyn couldn’t tell if it was fear or anger—or something worse. Elmira seemed younger than Arlyn had expected a forest spirit to be. Not a child, exactly, but not the ancient, delicate thing the old books described either.

“What’s happening?” Arlyn asked, trying to keep her voice steady. “Why did the veil open for me?”

Elmira dropped to a low-hanging vine and perched like a bird. “I don’t know. That’s the worst part.”

“Don’t you live here? Aren’t you supposed to know everything?”

“I’m not like the others,” Elmira muttered. “I wasn’t born in the Hollow. Not really. I woke up here. No memory, no name, just… a shimmer. They said I was a mistake.”

Arlyn felt her breath catch. She had spent her entire life being told she was too curious, too strange, that her head was always in places it didn’t belong. Somehow, the way Elmira spoke—the tightness around her words—felt familiar.

“You named yourself, didn’t you?” Arlyn asked.

Elmira stiffened. “What of it?”

“I read about that,” Arlyn said. “Sprites are named by the forest. Only outcasts or… or reborn ones have to name themselves.”

That earned her a long stare. Then, to her surprise, Elmira laughed—not sweetly, not like bells or flutes, but like a hiccup of relief.

“You have been reading the old books.”

“Gran left them to me.”

Elmira cocked her head. “What was her name?”

“Branna Vey.”

Elmira froze. “The witch of the fifth grove?”

“She wasn’t a witch,” Arlyn said. “She was a historian.”

“Same thing.”

They fell silent. Somewhere beyond the glade, a branch cracked. Not a squirrel-snap, not a breeze-break. Heavier. Measured. Elmira turned in mid-air, her light brightening again as her senses sharpened.

“We need to leave,” she said.

“Why?”

“Because we’re being watched.”

Thiln crouched high in the canopy, hidden in the blue-vined yarrow that had woven itself into a small platform centuries ago. He had followed Elmira in silence, keeping to the air when possible, the branches when not. He watched the girl—this human, this Arlyn—with an intensity born of worry, yes, but also recognition.

She bore no mark of the old blood. No glow, no glyphs. But the way she had crossed the veil, how the ironbirch had bled when she arrived… it could not be coincidence. Too many signs were aligning. The Crown’s song was waking again. And if that song chose her...

He would have to speak to the Stonesoon. Even if it meant breaking the pact.

Thiln dropped from the tree, wings stiff, and melted into the darker parts of the Hollow, where roots formed tunnels and silence carried messages long before words could.

Elmira led Arlyn along a narrow path that hadn’t been a path until a moment before. The forest moved subtly around them, rearranging moss and branch to let them pass. Arlyn followed in silence, heart pounding, trying to memorize every detail—the upside-down lily clusters, the bark with spiraled ridges like fingerprint whorls, the sense that each step sank deeper into a dream.

They came to a clearing shaped like an eye, the center a shallow pool that reflected the sky with unsettling clarity. Elmira gestured for Arlyn to kneel beside it.

“This is the Seer’s Mirror,” she said. “Don’t touch the water. Just look.”

Arlyn leaned over the still surface.

At first, she saw nothing unusual—just her face, her wide eyes, a smear of dirt across her cheek. Then, the image shifted. The reflection became older, wilder—her hair twisted into bramble-wreaths, her skin lined with greenish veins like roots. Behind her, a throne carved from a single massive toadstool loomed.

She gasped and sat back, heart hammering.

“That’s what the Hollow sees in you,” Elmira said.

“That’s not me.”

“It might be.”

Arlyn looked up at her. “Do you see yourself differently too?”

Elmira didn’t answer.

Instead, she turned toward the edge of the glade, where vines had started to coil inward. “We have to go. This place draws attention.”

“Where are we going?”

“To someone who might have answers.”

They traveled deeper than Arlyn thought possible. The Hollow, from the outside, seemed no larger than a glade or two—maybe the size of a meadow. But within, it folded. Paths repeated. Trees stood in two places at once. Light changed too fast, then not at all. Arlyn stopped trying to track time.

Finally, they came to a gnarled hill that rose out of the earth like a blister. Its side was cracked, revealing a narrow entrance into dark. Elmira touched the moss above the opening and whispered something that didn’t sound like speech.

A warm breeze exhaled from the tunnel.

“Come on,” she said.

Arlyn hesitated, but followed.

Inside, the air was thick with root-smell and damp stone. Bioluminescent threads ran along the ceiling like stars caught in a net. The tunnel widened into a chamber hollowed into the base of a long-dead tree, its interior lined with bark that whispered faintly, like a hundred voices breathing.

At its center sat a figure.

He was taller than Elmira by a handspan, his wings sheared and bound with copper thread. His hair was moss-green, and his eyes glowed with a pale, fevered light. Carvings covered his skin—runes or scars, Arlyn couldn’t tell.

“Thiln,” Elmira said softly.

The figure didn’t move. “You brought her.”

“She needs to know.”

“She already knows,” Thiln said, opening his eyes fully. “She just hasn’t remembered yet.”

Arlyn stepped forward. “What do you mean?”

He studied her, gaze sharp as a blade. “You carry a seed of the Crown. It was buried generations ago, hidden in the bloodlines of those who turned away from the Green. The forest has called it forth in you.”

Arlyn shook her head. “That’s not possible. I’m just a—”

“No,” he said. “You were just a girl. Now, you’re a root of something old. And every root either grows or rots.”

He stood, and the chamber dimmed.

“You have seven days before the veil collapses completely. The old war is waking, and if you don’t learn how to wield the Crown’s gift, this time, the Hollow burns.”

Arlyn felt the world sway. Elmira’s hand caught her wrist.

“You’re not alone,” she said.

Arlyn looked at her, and for the first time since stepping into the forest, believed it.

Together, they turned toward the dark again, and walked deeper into the roots of fate.

The path beyond Thiln’s chamber grew narrower and stranger, spiraling downward like a burrowing worm made of lightless rock and root. Elmira led the way, the faint glow of her wings casting shadows that danced too deliberately across the walls. Arlyn followed closely behind, her thoughts scattered and loud, every heartbeat echoing with Thiln’s words—You carry a seed of the Crown.

She didn’t feel different. Her body hadn’t changed. She still remembered the taste of dandelion tea, the scratch of wool at her neck, the ache in her knees from crouching too long over a book. And yet… something in her blood responded to this place. To the Hollow. Like the deep roots of some old tree tugging upward inside her skin.

“Where are we going now?” she asked, her voice low to avoid disturbing the stillness.

“To the Stonewake,” Elmira said. “It’s where the Hollow remembers things too old for words. It may show you something the Seer’s Mirror didn’t.”

Arlyn tried to imagine how a place could remember, but then she glanced at the wall and saw the rock subtly reshaping itself—curling in patterns like writing half-finished—and decided not to ask.

After what felt like hours of walking, the tunnel opened abruptly into a vast chamber so wide and high it might have been the inside of a mountain. Pillars of fused bark and granite rose toward a ceiling veiled in mist. Strange lights blinked and moved far above, as if stars had wandered into the roots by mistake. At the center of the space lay a flat, obsidian-colored slab surrounded by concentric rings of moss and mushroom, their colors shifting in slow pulses.

Elmira gestured to the slab. “Lie down.”

Arlyn hesitated. “What if I see something I can’t understand?”

“You will. That’s the point.”

With slow, uncertain steps, Arlyn approached the stone and climbed atop it. It was warm—not unpleasantly so, but like a hearthstone that had been sitting by fire all night. The moment her back touched the surface, her body relaxed involuntarily, breath catching in her throat. The moss around the stone stirred.

Elmira stood at the edge of the nearest ring and closed her eyes. “Stonewake, listen. Let her root reach.”

The moss pulsed once, and then Arlyn fell inward.

It wasn’t sleep. It wasn’t waking either. The world fell away, then rebuilt itself in layered loops of memory and myth. She stood in a forest that was not the Hollow, yet somehow older, more wild. Trees towered impossibly tall, leaves glowing with silvery light, their trunks inscribed with songs that hummed softly beneath her feet. She was barefoot. She was younger. Or older. Or someone else.

Ahead, a figure waited. It wore a cloak made of antlered vines and eyes that flickered like candlelight.

“You’ve come late,” it said, and its voice was every wind she’d ever heard through her bedroom window.

“I don’t know who I am,” Arlyn replied.

“You are seed and soil both,” the figure said. “You are the echo of a pact, the second thorn on the same branch.”

“What pact?”

The figure did not answer. Instead, it held out its hand, and in its palm lay a shard of something too bright to be seen directly. Arlyn reached out, her fingers brushing the edge—

—and she was back.

The Stonewake exhaled, and the moss dimmed. Elmira was there, crouched at her side, eyes wide with tension.

“You spoke while you were dreaming,” she said. “You called me by another name.”

“What name?”

“Altheya.”

Arlyn sat up slowly. Her skin was damp with sweat. The stone beneath her heart still pulsed faintly.

“I think… I think I’ve been here before,” she whispered. “Not just today. Before my life. Before this life.”

Elmira didn’t speak for a long time.

Then, “The old legends say the first Crownbearer was not born but made. Woven from forest and flame, given form by choice. They say she wore three names—one for each life.”

“I saw something,” Arlyn said. “A crown made of thorn and fire. Not metal. It bled.”

“That was the first branch,” Elmira said, voice trembling. “And it was lost. Buried with the Warden who died sealing the veil. If it’s waking again…”

She trailed off. Neither needed to finish the sentence.

That night, they camped by the Weeping Hollow, a small spring nestled in the roots of three intertwined trees. The water was bitter, but Elmira drank without hesitation. Arlyn, hesitant, took only a sip and found it curiously sweet. The stars above the Hollow didn’t look like the ones from Wensgrove. They shifted when she wasn’t looking, forming symbols she couldn’t quite read.

“Do you miss them?” Arlyn asked as she stared upward.

“Who?”

“The other sprites.”

Elmira didn’t answer immediately. Her wings fluttered once, and she turned a pinecone over in her hands like a puzzle.

“They don’t see me as one of them,” she said at last. “Not really. I wasn’t born from bark and mist. I just… was. One day I blinked and the forest was around me. Thiln says I’m a ‘fault-light.’ A spark that wasn’t meant to catch.”

“That’s cruel.”

“It’s not cruelty if it’s true.”

“It can be both,” Arlyn said softly.

They sat in silence after that, the fire they’d coaxed from the moss casting long, lazy shadows. Arlyn found herself staring again at her hands. Nothing about them had changed—and yet she could feel the forest pressing close to her thoughts, as if waiting for her to say something only it would understand.

Elsewhere in the Hollow, deep below the twisted bone-roots of the Blacksythe Tree, Thiln stood before the Stonesoon—a creature more moss than form, its body a patchwork of lichen and old bark, its face hidden beneath a veil of roots.

“You spoke the name,” the Stonesoon rasped. “Altheya rises again.”

“She walks the Hollow already,” Thiln replied. “She touched the Mirror and the Wake. The Crown’s echo responds.”

“And the Order?”

“Moves. We are not the only ones who remember the war.”

The Stonesoon groaned—a sound not of pain, but of age made audible. “Then the time is near. The tree of ending stirs.”

Thiln stepped forward. “We need to prepare her. She does not understand what she carries.”

“No one does,” the Stonesoon said. “Not even the first Warden. The Crown makes kings of soil and monsters of root. If she wears it, she becomes the Hollow. If she refuses, the Hollow dies.”

“And Elmira?”

“She is the key that should not exist.”

“But she does exist.”

“Which makes her the most dangerous of all.”

At dawn, Arlyn woke to the sound of birds that didn’t sound like birds. They sang in harmonies too exact, notes layered like woven thread. Elmira was already up, crouched by the spring, sketching something into the dirt with a twig—a symbol, circular and fractured, like a sun cracked down the center.

“What’s that?” Arlyn asked as she stretched.

“A mark I saw in a dream,” Elmira said. “Same night you came through the veil. I’ve been seeing it since I named myself.”

“It’s familiar.”

Arlyn didn’t know why she said it. But it was true. The shape pulled at her mind, like an itch she couldn’t reach.

Elmira wiped it away quickly. “Come on. Thiln wants us to reach the Hollow’s edge before nightfall.”

“Why?”

“There’s something buried there. Something you’ll need, if you’re going to carry the Crown.”

“What is it?”

“A memory,” Elmira said. “But not yours.”

They reached the edge by dusk. Unlike the lush heart of the Hollow, the perimeter was lined with ash-blasted trees and silent pools where light bent the wrong way. It was a place of endings, not beginnings.

Elmira led Arlyn to a mound half-swallowed by bramble. Together they cleared the vines until a slab of wood was revealed, old and cracked, but with one unmistakable feature: the crown sigil carved deep in its center.

“This was hers,” Elmira whispered. “The first Warden. This is her grave.”

Arlyn knelt beside the slab. The moment her fingers touched the sigil, the world tilted.

She saw a battle—trees falling, fire spreading, sprites screaming. A woman with a crown of flame stood at the center, arms raised, singing a song that shattered the air. A tear rolled down her cheek as she fell backward into the earth, sealing the breach with her own breath.

Then Arlyn gasped and fell away from the vision.

Elmira caught her.

“She chose to die with the Hollow,” she said softly. “You might have to do the same.”

“I don’t want that.”

“No one ever does.”

They stared at the slab a moment longer. Then, without a word, they turned from the grave and walked back toward the Hollow’s heart—where war was already reaching through the roots.

The rain in the Hollow came without warning or sky. One moment the canopy filtered golden-green light, and the next it wept—not in drops, but in fine, whispering strands that glistened like thread. Arlyn held out her hand, watching the strange rainfall gather on her skin. It felt neither wet nor dry, not cold nor warm, but present, like the touch of something ancient and curious.

“It’s memory rain,” Elmira said, stepping carefully across a bridge made of woven roots. “The Hollow sheds it when it’s full.”

“Full of what?”

Elmira glanced back, her wings flickering. “Grief. Names. Things it hasn’t forgotten, but wishes it could.”

They had left the grave of the First Warden behind them, though Arlyn still felt its presence in her chest like a second heartbeat. She hadn’t spoken since waking from the vision at the gravesite. The images—fire, loss, the song that ended the war and the life that sang it—looped over and over in her head. She hadn’t been that woman, and yet the moment her fingers touched the sigil, it was as if the woman had opened a door and said, This is yours now.

Elmira slowed as they neared a clearing shaped like a broken wheel. Giant petals, each the size of a cartwheel, lined the rim of the glade, their insides pulsing faintly in time with the rain. At the center stood an obelisk made entirely of woven thorns, twisted into a lattice that almost looked like a cage.

“This is the Archive of Teeth,” Elmira said.

Arlyn frowned. “That sounds... unfriendly.”

“It is. But it listens.”

“What do you mean?”

“Every wound ever suffered in the Hollow leaves a mark here,” Elmira said, walking closer. “Physical, emotional—it doesn't matter. If it drew pain, it echoes here.”

“And you brought me here why?”

“Because the Crown is a thorn. It grows best in pain.”

Arlyn took a breath and stepped into the clearing. The petals quivered as she passed, and the thorn-obelisk let out a creaking groan, like wood trying to remember its first tree.

As she drew near, the air thickened. Words not spoken hung in the silence like dried herbs—too brittle to use, too dangerous to ignore. She reached out, one hand trembling.

And the Archive opened.

Not with a sound or a crack, but with feeling. Arlyn’s knees buckled as a rush of agony—not hers, but the forest’s—swept through her. She saw glimpses: a fire started by men in red coats, a grove razed to build a road that never lasted, a sprite crushed beneath a wheel, its glow snuffed like breath on glass. Thousands of tiny deaths, each remembered with exquisite detail.

And beneath all of them, the pain of the Warden’s final sacrifice. The Crown, abandoned. The veil, stitched shut by song and sorrow.

Elmira steadied her. “Don’t look too long,” she said. “The pain will keep you.”

“I saw… so much.”

“And that was only the shallow wounds. Deeper ones are locked in the Rootvault.”

Arlyn swallowed hard. “I think I understand now. Why it has to be me. Why the forest called me.”

Elmira’s expression softened for the first time. “Understanding doesn’t make it easier.”

“No. But it makes it necessary.”

Far from the Archive, in the ruins of a forgotten watchtower straddling the edge of Wensgrove, the Order of the Gloam assembled in silence. Ten figures stood in a circle, cloaked and masked, their faces hidden behind polished masks of bark and bone. In the center of their gathering, a basin of black sap bubbled faintly, emitting the smell of burnt root and dried blood.

“The girl has crossed,” said one—his voice deep, slow, carefully measured. “She walks the Hollow. The Thorn has taken root.”

“And the fault-light walks beside her,” murmured another, voice high and tremulous. “Unbound. Unnamed.”

“She is named,” corrected a third. “Elmira Briarwhisp.”

“That name was not given. It was taken.”

“Which makes her more dangerous.”

The leader raised a hand. “Enough. The crown must not rise again. The Thorn’s bloom would unravel the seal. The war would restart.”

“But the veil thins already,” said the tremulous one. “The Hollow cracks beneath its own remembering. Soon, it will fall.”

“Then we force their hand,” said the leader. “We move tonight.”

All ten stepped forward and dipped their hands into the basin.

The sap clung to them, binding fingers in black.

That night, as Arlyn and Elmira camped near the Hollow’s breath-tree—an enormous trunk that exhaled mist every few minutes like a sleeping beast—they were awoken by the sound of iron.

It clinked faintly, like a sword sheathed in bone.

Elmira snapped upright, light surging in alarm. “Run.”

Before Arlyn could ask why, the mist exploded inwards and something fast and sharp burst through the air between them. It struck the breath-tree, sending out a metallic shriek. A moment later, a second dart embedded in the moss beside Arlyn’s foot.

Figures emerged from the fog, cloaked and silent.

Elmira grabbed Arlyn’s wrist and pulled her back, her wings flaring in defense. “Run now.”

They darted into the woods, the Hollow shifting to shelter them. Branches bent to slow their pursuers. Roots pulled up to trip them. But the enemy had planned for this. Flames, cold and green, licked through the underbrush—fire that didn’t burn, but unwove.

“Nullfire,” Elmira hissed. “They brought nullfire.”

They reached the edge of a ridge and skidded to a halt. Below, a ravine opened, filled with thorn-fog and twisted saplings.

“No choice,” Elmira said.

She dove.

Arlyn hesitated—then jumped after her.

They fell through fog and landed hard among thorns that didn’t cut, but whispered. Arlyn sat up, dizzy, blood pounding in her ears. Above, their pursuers didn’t follow.

Elmira groaned. “They won’t come down here. The Hollow’s heart is too wild.”

Arlyn looked around. “Where are we?”

Elmira stood shakily, brushing off her tunic. “The Thornsoul. Deepest part of the forest. It's where the Hollow speaks clearest. And loudest.”

“And it brought us here.”

“Or… it wants something from us.”

They looked at one another—fear and resolve twin glimmers in their eyes.

Above them, the green fire crackled but could not cross.

Below them, something ancient waited.

And at Arlyn’s side, the pouch holding the leaf of song began to hum again.

The Thornsoul pulsed around them, a forest inside a forest, a second skin of the Hollow folded deep under its surface. Where the rest of the woods bore life in bark and moss, here everything whispered and watched. Vines moved of their own accord, curling along Arlyn’s boots like curious cats. Flowers opened not to light, but to breath. Even the trees seemed to lean in to listen to the sound of thought.

Elmira walked slowly, her light flickering uncertainly. She had not been here before, not this deep, not in this part of the Hollow where even sprites feared to tread. The ground was spongy with ancient decay, but no rot clung to it. It smelled of renewal, of something dying just to become again.

Arlyn stayed close behind, keeping one hand near the pouch where the leaf continued to vibrate softly. The hum rose and fell with her heartbeat now, as though the forest and her blood were trying to match rhythms.

“This place is alive,” she said.

Elmira nodded, then paused. “No… not just alive. It remembers. Everything that’s ever bled into the soil, it’s here. Feel that?”

A deep thrumming echoed beneath their feet. Not loud, not threatening. A breath in reverse. A memory growing.

They descended further into the hollowed basin where the Thornsoul coiled inward like a spiral. In its center stood a singular tree—black, barkless, and leafless, but radiating a deep luminescence from within its wood. Roots stretched up instead of down, threading through the air like veins. Its shape wasn’t quite right—crooked in places, shifting subtly as they stared.

“That’s the Heartwood,” Elmira whispered.

Arlyn approached it. “It’s beautiful.”

“It’s dangerous.”

“I know.”

Something in the tree pulsed when Arlyn stepped within arm’s reach. Not light. Not heat. Recognition.

And the leaf in her pouch burst into flame.

She yelped, reaching to pull it free, but there was no pain. The flame danced without heat, spiraling upward like smoke caught in wind. Elmira stepped back, eyes wide. The tree answered. A low hum rose from its core, vibrating the very ground.

Then, like a dream stitched from bark and sorrow, the air above the Heartwood twisted and formed an image—hazy, shifting, but slowly sharpening. A woman stood there. Not flesh, but light wrapped in the shape of memory. She was tall, crowned in thorn and fire, her robes formed from roots and fog. Her eyes, green as the Hollow’s oldest leaves, locked onto Arlyn.

“You are the second echo,” the woman said, her voice both inside and outside the world. “The Hollow remembers. The Thorn returns.”

Arlyn swallowed. “Who are you?”

“I was Altheya. I wore the Crown when it still bled freely. I sang the song that sealed the breach and gave my name to the soil. Now I remain only as breath, waiting for the branch to bloom again.”

Elmira stepped forward. “Is she a spirit?”

“No,” Arlyn said, softly. “She’s a root. Left behind.”

Altheya turned her gaze to Elmira. “And you… flicker-born. You should not be. And yet, you are.”

Elmira flinched, her wings tightening. “I didn’t ask to exist.”

“No. But you do. And that may make all the difference.”

The vision began to flicker.

“Listen closely,” Altheya said, her voice fracturing. “The Order of the Gloam seeks to cut the root of memory. They fear the Thorn’s return. They fear what you will become. They will strike the Hollow at its weakest—the Sourcepond, where the veil thins. You must go there. Find the Bloomstone. If it breaks, the forest’s mind will collapse. All this will unravel.”

Then she looked at Arlyn again. “The Thorn does not choose lightly. But when it chooses, it does not release.”

The image shattered into light and rain, and the Heartwood went silent.

For a long time, neither of them moved.

Then Elmira said, “We have to reach the Sourcepond before they do.”

Arlyn nodded, still trembling. “How far?”

“Three veils deep,” Elmira said. “We’ll have to cross the Stillgrove.”

“What’s that?”

Elmira grimaced. “A place where nothing moves. Not wind. Not time.”

“That sounds… awful.”

“It is.”

The path to the Stillgrove was not a path at all. It revealed itself in glimpses—a branch bent the wrong way, a stone warm when it should have been cold, a breath of air that smelled faintly of mint and ash. Elmira led with instinct, not direction, and Arlyn followed, half-blind, her body beginning to ache from more than just exertion.

The Hollow pressed in closer here. Trees grew twisted with memory. Petals held the shape of faces. Once, Arlyn thought she saw her father’s profile in the bark of a cypress. Another time, she heard Gran’s voice humming in the rustling leaves.

The forest was waking. Not in the way a creature wakes, but in the way a mountain remembers it once was flame.

Finally, they reached the edge of the Stillgrove.

It looked like the rest of the Hollow at first—verdant, dense, green—but not a single thing moved. No birds. No wind. The trees stood too straight, their branches frozen at unnatural angles. Leaves hung mid-fall, suspended in air as if trapped in sap.

Elmira held out an arm. “Don’t breathe too deeply.”

“Why not?”

“The air here carries memory that doesn’t belong to you. It’ll try to wear your shape.”

Arlyn stepped carefully into the grove, her skin prickling. The moment she entered, it was like she had walked into a painting. Her limbs felt heavier. Her thoughts moved slower.

Beside her, Elmira glowed faintly, her shimmer forcing the stillness back just enough to keep them moving.

“Why is this place like this?” Arlyn asked.

“It was the last battle,” Elmira said. “When Altheya sealed the veil. The energy twisted everything. Froze it.”

Arlyn reached out to touch a hanging leaf. As her finger brushed it, a rush of images flooded her—shouting, fire, blood, songs that cracked the sky—and she staggered backward.

Elmira caught her. “I told you. It remembers everything.”

They pushed on, deeper into the frozen green, until they reached the center of the Stillgrove.

There, surrounded by pillars of petrified light, floated a pool of water so still it reflected the underside of the leaves above it perfectly. In its center, resting atop a curved root, was the Bloomstone.

It looked simple—an oblong crystal the color of pressed heather, pulsing faintly with each breath Arlyn took. She stepped toward it instinctively.

Then the grove shuddered.

Something had entered.

Elmira cursed. “Too late.”

Figures emerged from between the trees—six cloaked in bark and bone, masks glinting dully in the half-light. They stepped without sound, but the Hollow screamed around them. The Stillgrove tried to resist their presence, but even time could not hold them back.

The lead figure spoke. “Arlyn of Wensgrove. Step away from the stone.”

“Who are you?” she demanded, voice shaking.

“We are the hands of forgetting,” the figure said. “We are the cut that heals. The war ended because we ended it. And we will not let it return.”

“You want to destroy the Bloomstone.”

“To prevent the Thorn from blooming again. The Hollow must sleep.”

Arlyn looked at the stone. Then at Elmira.

“No,” she said.

“Then you die with it.”

The Order moved as one.

Elmira raised her hands, vines erupting from the ground at her command. Arlyn felt something rise inside her—hot, wild, and sharp. Not rage. Not magic. Purpose.

She stepped into the pool.

The Bloomstone answered.

Light erupted—pure, ancient, green-and-gold like the Hollow’s first dawn. The Order staggered. Elmira cried out, shielding her eyes.

And Arlyn heard a voice—her voice, but older, deeper, singing a name that wasn’t hers but fit like skin.

The Order fell back. Their leader screamed as his mask cracked. The stillness broke. Leaves fell. The wind returned.

The grove exhaled.

And the Bloomstone bloomed.

Chapter Four: The Bloom and the Blade

The Bloomstone continued to pulse long after the battle had ended. Its glow was no longer faint or hesitant. Now it flared with living color, a rhythm that matched Arlyn’s heartbeat. Petals had formed around its base—delicate shapes of crystal and bark, blooming from the still water as if coaxed by her presence. The stone was no longer just a relic. It was alive again. And it had chosen.

Arlyn stood in the shallows of the pool, water lapping gently at her ankles, arms loose at her sides. Her chest heaved, not from exhaustion but from something deeper—an awareness, like her blood had begun to carry more than breath. The song she had heard was gone now, but it had left its mark, a warmth behind her sternum that pulsed in sync with the Bloomstone’s light.

Elmira approached cautiously, stepping over the withered vines that had lashed out during the skirmish. The bodies of the masked attackers—those who had not fled—lay motionless among the frozen underbrush. Their cloaks had begun to unravel, threads turning to ash as the Hollow rejected them.

“Are you hurt?” Elmira asked.

Arlyn shook her head slowly. “No. I don’t think so. But something’s changed.”

Elmira glanced at the Bloomstone. “You’re bound now. Fully.”

“To the Thorn?”

“To the Hollow. To its memory. You sang, Arlyn. That wasn’t a spell. That was a binding.”

Arlyn’s mind reeled. “I don’t know how I did it.”

“You didn’t need to. The Thorn remembers what you forgot.”

She stepped into the pool and knelt beside the newly formed petals, running a hand over one. It was warm to the touch. “The Crown is blooming again. That’s what this means.”

Arlyn’s voice was barely above a whisper. “And that means the war’s coming back.”

“Unless we stop it,” Elmira said. “Or finish it.”

Far to the west, where the Hollow met the sheer cliffs of the Ravelspine, the wind carried wordless songs into the sky. Old winds, old magic. The kind that remembered names not spoken since the first roots grew. In a ruin carved into the mountainside, the last Sentinel of the Green sat alone, eyes closed, fingers dipped in a shallow bowl of honeyed sap.

He had felt the Bloomstone stir.

“Too early,” he murmured. “Too soon.”

The rootbound scrolls at his side curled tighter, their sigils glowing faintly. A white bird perched nearby, its feathers like dry parchment. It tilted its head at him and blinked once.

“The Thorn sings again,” he said, not looking at it. “And a girl wears its tune.”

The bird let out a single, low note.

“Then it’s time,” the Sentinel said. “The Grovewardens must wake.”

Back in the Hollow, Arlyn and Elmira gathered what they could from the Stillgrove and began their journey toward the Veilrise—the last known place where the Thorn Crown had fully bloomed before it was hidden. The Hollow had changed around them. The stillness was broken now, and with it came movement. New vines grew in hours. Trees budded strange flowers in impossible colors. The forest stirred like something stretching after a long, uneasy sleep.

“The Bloomstone is only one piece,” Elmira said as they picked their way over a bridge of fallen branches. “The Crown wasn’t forged. It was grown. In pieces. Bloomstone. Rootblade. Veilbark. And the Song.”

Arlyn looked over. “You mean the song I sang?”

Elmira nodded. “That was only a thread. The full Song of the Thorn hasn’t been sung in an age. It needs all four pieces to be heard again.”

“So we find the rest.”

Elmira stopped suddenly. “You say that like it’s simple. But the Rootblade was lost in the War of Boughs. It sank into the Tarnmere, and no sprite has dared go near that water since.”

“We don’t have time for fear.”

“That’s the problem,” Elmira said, voice tight. “It’s not fear. It’s memory. That place remembers what it took. If we go there, it might remember us too.”

Arlyn placed a hand on her friend’s arm. “Then we remind it that we came to heal. Not to take.”

They didn’t speak again for a while, the forest muttering around them. The Hollow’s mood had changed since the Bloomstone bloomed. It wasn’t hostile, not exactly, but watchful. As if it wasn’t sure what kind of story was being written yet.

When they stopped to rest near a ring of lanternstalks—fungus that glowed in response to kindness—Arlyn examined the pouch where she had kept the leaf. It had burned away during the song, but left behind a faint stain on the fabric. She touched it absently, and images flared behind her eyes: hands raised in defiance, the sound of roots splitting stone, the terrible calm before sacrifice.

Elmira sat beside her, folding her legs neatly beneath her. “What do you remember when you close your eyes now?”

Arlyn thought. “I remember… both lives. Mine. Hers. But only pieces. It’s like trying to catch wind.”

Elmira’s wings flickered gently. “That’s how it started for Altheya, they say. Half a life remembered, half lived.”

“She must’ve felt so alone.”

“She wasn’t,” Elmira said. “But she thought she was. That’s what doomed her.”

Arlyn looked away, unsure what to say. The words sat heavy in her chest.

As they pressed on, the Hollow grew stranger. Time slipped. Paths repeated. Night crept in around midday. They encountered things that should not have existed: a fox with bark for fur, a brook that ran upward through a tree’s hollow trunk, a cloud of moths that murmured lullabies in the tongues of long-dead keepers. Arlyn found herself losing track of what was real and what was remembered.

But always, Elmira pulled her forward. Always, the path bent when she called it.

At the crest of a ridge covered in silver fern, they looked out over the horizon.

“There,” Elmira pointed. “That’s the Tarnmere.”

A lake, dark and unmoving, sprawled below them like spilled ink. No birds flew above it. No breeze touched its surface. At its center, something gleamed faintly under the water.

“That’s where the Rootblade sleeps,” Elmira said. “Or waits.”

Arlyn exhaled slowly. “Then that’s where we go.”

Elmira nodded. “And we better hope it remembers mercy.”

The Tarnmere was a wound on the forest. Arlyn felt it before she reached the shore, a humming in her bones that grew louder with every step. It wasn’t a song like the one she had heard in the Stillgrove—it was more like the silence between notes, an ache that wanted to become sound. Elmira’s wings dimmed as they approached, her usual shimmer dulled to a murky glow.

“Careful,” she murmured. “The Tarn doesn’t like trespassers.”

The lake stretched unnaturally still, reflecting nothing, its surface thick and dark like oil. Even the sky above it was smeared, cloudless yet gray. Around the shoreline, old roots twisted up from the mud, petrified and bleached, remnants of trees that had leaned too close. Each one was shaped like a reaching hand.

Arlyn crouched and touched the edge of the water. It rippled—not outward, but inward, as though the Tarn had drawn her in with the touch.

“What happened here?” she asked.

“The Rootblade was wielded here last,” Elmira said, her voice hushed. “During the final turning of the War of Boughs. A Warden named Halren tried to hold the line with it. They say the blade was too powerful—it unraveled the veil beneath the water. When he fell, it fell with him.”

Arlyn straightened. “But it’s still here. I saw it. From the ridge.”

Elmira nodded slowly. “Then we follow what you saw. Just… don’t let the Tarn see you. Not too much.”

They made their way along a twisted path of root bridges and black stones, weaving around clusters of ash-trees with their leaves permanently curled inward. The lake breathed, once—just once—a soft, low exhalation that made the ground tremble. Arlyn caught herself on a bent reed and held her breath until the feeling passed.

When they reached the promontory that jutted into the center of the Tarnmere, they found what they were looking for. Half-buried beneath a web of green-glass moss was the hilt of a blade, protruding from the water like a single thorn. It pulsed faintly, as if it had a heartbeat of its own.

“The Rootblade,” Elmira breathed.

“It’s waiting.”

“For who?” Arlyn asked, stepping toward the edge. “Me?”

“Only one way to find out.”

Arlyn knelt, resting a hand on the stone where the hilt pierced upward. The moment her skin touched it, the world around her shifted—not with violence, but with memory.

She was somewhere else.

She stood in a clearing ringed with fallen leaves, though no trees stood nearby. Before her, a man knelt in armor made of bark and bronze, a blade of root and light in his hand. His face was streaked with dirt and tears.

“Forgive me,” he whispered to the blade. “I wasn’t strong enough.”

Then he drove the blade into the earth, and the memory shattered.

Arlyn gasped and staggered back, her breath ragged.

Elmira caught her. “You saw Halren?”

“He gave it up. Not because he failed—because it was too much. He couldn’t carry it anymore.”

“That’s what the Rootblade is,” Elmira said. “It doesn’t cut the body. It cuts the burden. Every time it’s lifted, it remembers the weight of those who came before.”

Arlyn looked at the hilt. “Then it remembers Halren.”

“It remembers all of them.”

Without further hesitation, Arlyn reached out and gripped the blade.

The Tarn resisted. Water surged up, thick tendrils of black mist spiraling around her arm. A voice hissed from the lake—not words, not language, but feeling. Not again. Not again.

But Arlyn didn’t let go.

“I’m not here to take,” she said aloud, through gritted teeth. “I’m here to carry.”

And the Rootblade rose.

The moss slid away, the mist recoiled. The blade lifted from the water like it had waited for breath. It wasn’t metal—it was wood, but hardened, lacquered with amber veins. Along its length pulsed the symbols of old, glowing faintly with green light. Where the hilt met the blade, a knot of goldleaf shimmered like a second heartbeat.

Elmira took a step back. “You really are the Thornbearer.”

Arlyn looked at the blade in her hands. It felt both heavy and light, like carrying part of a story still being written.

“I don’t want to be a weapon.”

“Then make yourself a shield,” Elmira said.

A crack of thunder rolled across the lake.

Both girls looked up. The sky, already gray, had darkened further. Clouds twisted in spirals. A cold wind rushed through the trees that dared grow near the Tarn.

And from the water, a shape emerged.

It wasn’t a person. Not exactly. It was the memory of Halren—the echo of his final stand, animated by the blade’s return. Eyes hollow, mouth stitched shut by vines. The armor he had worn now fused with his body, glowing faintly with the grief of a thousand battles.

“It’s him,” Arlyn whispered. “But wrong.”

Elmira drew back. “The Tarn’s way of asking if you’re worthy. You’ll have to fight him.”

“I don’t want to fight the dead.”

“Then help him rest.”

Halren’s echo raised his arms, and tendrils of vine lashed toward them.

Arlyn raised the Rootblade.

The blade didn’t cut—it unraveled. Where it passed, the vines frayed and dissolved into memory. The echo lunged, silent but filled with sorrow. Arlyn ducked and swept the blade upward, severing the grief without striking flesh.

The memory wailed—soundless—and retreated.

Arlyn stepped forward. “You carried the Thorn. You remembered the pain. Let it go now. Let me carry what’s left.”

The echo froze. Slowly, it lowered its arms.

Then, like smoke pulled into wind, it faded—leaving only the hilt of a second blade behind, buried in the stone.

Arlyn stared. “What is—”

Elmira reached for it, then hesitated. “It’s a branch. A companion to yours. For the one who walks beside the Thornbearer.”

She gripped the hilt. It accepted her.

The blade unfurled—not in wood, but in light and root, smaller than Arlyn’s, shaped like a dagger. Not to lead, but to defend.

“Looks like I’m with you for the long road,” Elmira said.

“I wouldn’t want anyone else,” Arlyn replied, chest rising with something like resolve.

Above them, the clouds parted slightly.

And far away, beyond the edges of the Hollow, someone—or something—felt the Thorn stir.

And screamed.

The following hours passed in a haze of travel and silence. Arlyn and Elmira didn’t speak much as they left the Tarnmere behind. The lake, now calm once more, had returned to its stillness, the surface closing like an eye that had watched too much. The Rootblade was strapped across Arlyn’s back, humming faintly against her spine. Elmira’s branch-dagger nestled in her belt, curling faint tendrils of root and light that responded to her movements.

Neither girl spoke about the echo of Halren again.

There was a shared understanding—an unspoken reverence for what had happened. Halren had not been defeated, not truly. He had been released. And in doing so, he had gifted Arlyn more than just a blade—he had entrusted her with his memory, his pain, and his vow to protect the Hollow, no matter the cost.

The forest felt the change. Where before it had been cautious, now the Hollow seemed to open to them willingly. Vines lifted out of their way. Ferns bowed as they passed. Strange creatures, half-seen behind bark and bloom, followed at a respectful distance. It was as if the land itself had acknowledged the rebirth of its Warden.

They paused at dusk beneath a crownwillow, the tree’s branches falling like curtains of green lace around them. Arlyn sat with her back to the trunk, watching the Rootblade pulse against the dim light of the setting sun. Elmira crouched nearby, poking at a pot of simmering root broth that smelled faintly of ginger and moss.

“We’ve changed something,” Arlyn said softly.

Elmira didn’t look up. “Yes.”

“The Hollow feels… alive in a way it didn’t before. Not just awake. Like it remembers how to be alive.”

“The blades are keys,” Elmira said. “Each one unseals a different piece of the story.”

“And the story’s not done,” Arlyn said. “Is it.”

Elmira shook her head. “Not even close. We still need the Veilbark.”

“And the Song.”

At that, Elmira hesitated. Her hand stirred the broth slower now, a crease forming between her brows.

“What?” Arlyn asked.

“The Song is the hardest part,” Elmira said quietly. “Not because it’s hidden. But because it only exists if someone is willing to sing it. If they carry the full weight. If they remember everything and still choose to speak it aloud.”

“Altheya did.”

“She did,” Elmira said. “And it broke her.”

Arlyn felt the weight of that truth settle over her like a second shadow. “Then I’ll need to be stronger.”

Elmira finally looked at her, and for the first time, there was something in her eyes that went beyond cautious trust. It was belief. Real and wordless.

“You might be,” she said.

The broth was ready. They ate in silence, steam rising in curls toward the crownwillow’s leaves. Night crept in gently, soft-footed and filled with the rustle of unseen things. The Hollow was quiet again, but no longer silent. Not in the way it had been when the Thorn lay dormant.

Now it was the silence of breath being held.

A waiting.

At the edge of the world, where the Hollow's roots met the bones of forgotten mountains, the Order of the Gloam gathered again. Their numbers had thinned. Five cloaked figures remained, cloaks wet with mist, sap bleeding through the fabric where their magic had been burned clean by the Thorn's bloom.

“She carries the blade,” said the one in the middle, voice raw.

“She awakened the song fragment,” hissed another. “The Bloomstone speaks again.”

“And now the Rootblade.”

“The Thorn was never meant to rise again.”

A heavy pause.

“She does not yet have the Veilbark,” one said. “Nor the full Song.”

“But she will.” The speaker’s mask had cracked—half gone, revealing a pale, wrinkled mouth twisted in contempt. “And when she does, the seal breaks. The Hollow reclaims the world.”

“We cannot let that happen.”

There was a silence deeper than words.

Then the leader of the remaining five stepped forward. His mask was bone-white, unmarred. He carried no weapon.

“I will go myself,” he said.

And the others bowed—not in reverence, but in necessity.

Arlyn dreamt of branches that stretched past the sky, vines that wound around stars. She stood on the cusp of a world built from bark and fire, wearing a crown that pulsed like a second heart. The Rootblade hummed in her hand. A great beast waited in the dark beneath her feet—not evil, not cruel, but ancient and starved.

When she looked down at her chest, she saw a thorn buried deep, woven into her ribs.

A voice whispered from the roots below.

“Only the wound can open the veil. Only the broken can sing the song.”

She woke with tears in her eyes and didn’t know why.

Elmira was already awake, sharpening her dagger with a stone that glowed faintly.

“We leave for the Veilrise at first light,” she said, her voice low.

Arlyn nodded.

Because there was no turning back.

The Thorn had bloomed.

And the forest would never sleep again.

Chapter Five: The Veilrise Beckons

The Hollow was no longer hiding. As Arlyn and Elmira pushed deeper toward the Veilrise, it became clear that the forest had shifted its shape, not to evade, but to guide. Paths opened where there had been none, light bled in through impossible gaps in the canopy, and birds that hadn’t sung in generations trilled wary melodies from unseen branches. Yet there was a tension in it all—like the breath before a scream, the silence between the drop and the impact.

The air had grown heavier, tinged with the sharp, dry scent of burned herbs and ironwood sap. Elmira moved cautiously now, less certain with each step, her glow restrained and dimmed. She could feel it, too. The Veilrise was near, and with it, the part of the Hollow that remembered too much.

“This isn’t a normal part of the forest,” she said. “We’re in the Bordering Wood. Between the breath of the Hollow and the bones of the veil. Things live here that don’t belong in either.”

Arlyn gripped the Rootblade tighter. She had kept it close since the Tarnmere, strapped across her back by woven reed and bark-thread. The blade whispered to her sometimes—not in words, but in pulses, moments of intuitive understanding. It didn’t speak like a voice; it leaned. Toward danger. Toward memory. Toward truth.

“What should I expect?” Arlyn asked.

Elmira paused near a knot of brambles whose thorns swayed despite the windless air. “You’ll feel like you’re walking into yourself. But it’s not you. It’s the you that could have been. Or was. The Veilrise doesn’t just separate this world from others. It reflects.”

“That sounds horrible.”

“It is.”

They came upon a clearing that wasn’t a clearing. It was shaped like a circle, yes, but the trees didn’t recede. Instead, they grew inward, bending toward each other until their branches knitted into an archway suspended high above the ground. Beneath it, a pale pool shimmered with impossible stillness, and above that shimmer, the air fractured—split like glass held just at the point before breaking. A spiderweb of light, motionless but somehow always shifting.

“The Veilrise,” Elmira said. “This is where Altheya made her final vow. Where she unstitched the last piece of herself and left it behind.”

Arlyn stepped into the clearing. Immediately, her breath caught. Her vision doubled, then trebled. She saw herself ahead of her and beside her, a dozen flickers of her own face reflected in the veil’s broken edge. Her memories began to bleed at the borders—snatches of her mother’s laugh, Gran’s books, the sound of Wensgrove’s bell—threading into places they did not belong. She took another step, and they were gone again.

Elmira remained just behind the veil’s fracture, her wings quivering with effort. “I can’t follow you in,” she said. “Not all the way.”

“Why not?”

“Because this part is you, Arlyn. Only you. The Veilrise is the test. If you’re not meant to carry the Song, it’ll… turn you back.”

“And if I am?”

Elmira’s face was grim. “Then it will break you first.”

Arlyn didn’t ask more. She walked forward.

The veil parted like breath blown on a dandelion.

The world inside the Veilrise was quiet. But not empty. Shapes moved without movement. Sound rippled without echo. Time folded in on itself like a petal curling in sleep.

Arlyn stood in a space that defied place—a hollow sphere of sky and earth and flame, where each step became a memory and each breath became a choice. Her first was not to scream. Her second was to keep walking.

She passed a younger version of herself—barefoot, hands stained with berry juice, running through the orchard behind her family’s home. That version didn’t see her. Then she passed herself at Gran’s funeral, clutching a bundle of herbs and pressing them into the dirt, whispering the name of every plant she could remember. Her grief had been frantic, catalogued. This version also ignored her.

She saw more. Herself as a child, alone in the attic with Gran’s forbidden book. Herself arguing with her father in the cold morning light. Herself in Wensgrove’s chapel, kneeling in silence, trying to feel something sacred and finding only dust.

Each memory shimmered, then dissipated.

At the center of the Veilrise stood a mirror. Not made of glass, but of still water suspended in air. Within it, Arlyn saw someone she had never seen before—but who still wore her face.

The reflection stepped forward.

It was taller, wilder, crowned in a circlet of woven fire and root, the Rootblade glowing at her side like a star on the verge of collapse. Her eyes were green like the deepest part of the Hollow, and her skin bore the scars of battle—not wounds, but runes etched by time and memory.

“You’re not real,” Arlyn whispered.

“No,” the reflection said, voice like wind through bramble. “I’m who you could become.”

“What do you want?”

“Nothing. This place isn’t a guardian. It’s a gate. I am the key you must make peace with.”

“I’m not ready to be her.”

“You’ll never be ready,” the reflection said. “You will choose. That is the only power the Thorn gives: to choose whether or not to carry.”

Arlyn clenched her fists. “And if I choose wrong?”

The reflection smiled. “Then you plant a seed for someone else to try again.”

There was no threat in her voice. Only patience. Endless, terrible patience.

Arlyn stepped forward. “Then let’s finish this.”

The reflection raised her hand, and the air between them turned to root and fire.

Outside the veil, Elmira waited.

The Hollow was restless. The trees groaned, not with wind, but with pressure—some great tension building behind the curve of the world. Light flickered unnaturally across the surface of the veil fracture, bending in angles that hurt to look at. Elmira pressed her palms together, trying to calm the fear rising in her gut.

And then she felt it.

A chord struck inside the forest. Not a sound—but an alignment. Like something had been tuned.

The Hollow listened.

A figure stepped back through the veil.

Arlyn looked the same. But her presence filled the glade. The Rootblade pulsed steadily at her side. Her eyes gleamed with clarity, and around her shoulders, a faint weave of vine and thread shimmered in rhythm with her breath.

Elmira took a step forward, heart thudding. “You… passed.”

Arlyn nodded, her voice quiet but certain. “The Song is inside me now.”

“You heard it?”

“No,” Arlyn said. “I am it.”

Elmira’s breath caught.

“Then the Veilbark is all that’s left.”

Arlyn looked east, toward the forgotten groves and the windswept ridges beyond the Hollow’s edge.

“No,” she said. “The bark is next. But it’s not the last. There’s one more piece.”

“What?”

Arlyn looked at her, her expression hardening with certainty.

“Me.”

They departed the Veilrise at dawn, though it was difficult to say if time flowed properly in that place. The Hollow greeted them again like a breath let go, the tension in the branches easing, the birdsong tentative but real. As Arlyn and Elmira crossed back into the living forest, the light followed them—less dramatic than the song-born bloom at the Stillgrove, but no less significant. The forest knew something had shifted.

Arlyn no longer stumbled. She walked with the rhythm of someone who had been measured, hollowed, and filled again. She had not only glimpsed the version of herself that bore the Thorn—she had embraced her. And the Hollow, in return, had woven that path into its breath.

Elmira noticed it immediately.

“You’re humming.”

Arlyn blinked. “What?”

“You’re humming something.”

She listened and realized it was true—a low, unconscious melody, unfamiliar yet comforting. It was the tune the Hollow had placed in her chest. Not all of the Song—just a thread—but it wound around her voice like ivy on a trellis.

“I didn’t know,” she murmured. “It just started.”

Elmira smiled faintly. “It’s how it begins. That’s how the Song grows. Not from ritual. From remembering.”

They walked for half a day, passing through a grove of silent bells—flowers that once chimed at each footfall but had long since fallen mute. As Arlyn walked past, one of them quivered and let out a single, perfect note. Elmira’s eyes widened, but she said nothing.

The path toward the Veilbark Grove was long. They skirted the edges of long-dead settlements built by the Hollow’s earliest kin—sprites who had once dwelled openly among root and branch. Now those homes were overgrown, doorways sealed by spiderroot and forget-me-leaf, walls slanted with the slow breath of centuries. A few held symbols etched into the stone, glyphs that glowed briefly as Arlyn passed them, then faded into moss.

As night fell, they camped by a collapsed root-bridge, half-swallowed by the river beneath. The water here smelled of smoke and myrrh.

Elmira fed the fire with strips of dried bark that hissed as they burned. Arlyn sat nearby, the Rootblade across her knees. She was no longer watching the flames but listening to the silence behind them.

“There’s something you’re not saying,” Elmira said at last.

Arlyn hesitated. “When I passed through the Veilrise, I saw more than myself. I saw… endings. Futures that didn’t happen. Or haven’t yet.”

“Prophecy?”

“No. Possibility.”

Elmira leaned forward. “What did you see?”

“You, dying,” Arlyn said quietly. “Trying to protect me.”

Elmira’s expression didn’t change, but her hands went still.

“And I saw myself alone,” Arlyn continued. “Carrying the Thorn. Singing the Song. But no one was left to hear it.”

“I don’t believe in destiny,” Elmira said.

“Neither do I. That’s the worst part. The Veil didn’t show what must be. Only what might be.”

“Then we choose differently.”

Arlyn smiled. “That’s why I told you. So we can.”

They reached the edge of the Veilbark Grove on the third day.

There was no mistaking it. The trees grew in tight circles, their trunks twisted into spirals, their bark dark as midnight and flecked with glimmers like starlight. The ground was bare—no underbrush, no moss, just dry, crackling soil that shimmered faintly with forgotten magic. In the center of the grove stood a single tree taller than all the others, its roots curled inward like claws holding something down.

“This is it,” Elmira whispered. “The last tree of the First Binding.”

Arlyn stepped forward. “Where the Warden gave up her name.”

“Where the bark learned to remember.”

She approached slowly, the Rootblade in hand, its pulse resonating with the air around her. As she neared the tree, she heard a sound—like breath caught between two hearts.

Then the bark split.

Not violently, but like a flower opening. From the center, a shard of smooth wood slid forth, pale and veined with glowing runes. It pulsed once, and Arlyn reached out instinctively.

The moment her fingers closed around it, the Grove erupted in light.

Wind rushed outward from the core of the tree, sweeping through the circle and out into the rest of the forest. The other veilbark trees trembled in harmony, their star-speckled bark igniting in glimmers. The ground cracked, not from pressure but from release.

The shard vibrated in Arlyn’s hand and then melted—not away, but into her palm. The runes curled over her skin, branding themselves across her wrist and forearm in lines of light.

“It accepted you,” Elmira breathed. “The Veilbark chose.”

Arlyn’s knees nearly gave out. She caught herself on the Rootblade and looked down at the markings. They didn’t hurt. They sang.

“We have them all now,” she said. “The Bloomstone, the Rootblade, the Veilbark.”

“Not quite,” Elmira said, stepping closer. “You said it before. There’s still one more piece.”

Arlyn looked up.

“Me.”

Elmira nodded. “Not just as your guardian. Or friend. The Thorn doesn’t bloom unless it’s witnessed. The Song needs two voices. One to carry, one to echo.”

Arlyn touched the edge of the markings on her arm. “Then we sing together.”

Before Elmira could reply, the light above them snapped like a struck string. The glimmers vanished. The trees shivered in pain.

And the sky broke.

Darkness poured downward—not night, but a storm of silence. The remaining cloaked members of the Order of the Gloam descended from the treetops like falling stars of ash and root. At their head, a man with no mask, no cloak—only a crown of bone and rot woven tight across his brow.

“You’ve gathered too much,” he said. “And we are out of time.”

Arlyn rose slowly, her body still glowing faintly. She did not draw the Rootblade.

She simply stood.

“You’re too late,” she said. “The Hollow sings again.”

“We’ll silence it.”

“No,” Elmira said, stepping beside her. “You’ll listen.”

The Hollow stirred around them, roots rising, leaves whispering. The veilbark trees hummed in chorus, and Arlyn raised her hand—not to strike, but to sing.

And this time, the Song began with two voices.

Chapter Six: The Song That Breaks

The first note was not perfect.

It cracked, uncertain, caught between breath and memory. Arlyn’s voice trembled at the edges, the melody too large for her throat, the pitch trying to settle somewhere between fear and defiance. But it was true. That was what mattered. In the Hollow, truth had weight. Truth grew things. And truth, once spoken in song, could not be taken back.

Beside her, Elmira added her voice—not harmony, not yet, but counterpoint. Where Arlyn’s tone reached upward, Elmira’s grounded it. Hers was the voice of bark and leaf, of cold water trickling through roots. Sprites did not often sing aloud, but when they did, it was not for beauty. It was for balance. For binding.

The Grove of Veilbark shivered.

The leader of the Order of the Gloam stepped forward, jaw tight, hands clenched. His name was lost to time, scrubbed away by years of unmaking. Where his face should have been lined with age, it was instead carved with channels of bark—scars or inscriptions, no one could say. His crown of rot twisted like a live thing atop his brow.

“You think your voices matter?” he spat. “You’re children playing with fire built for gods.”

Arlyn kept singing.

The Song shifted with her. Gained structure. A spiral of notes spun into the canopy, and with them came movement. Trees leaned in to listen. The air stilled, thickened, holding breath like glass before the shatter.

“You’re too late,” he growled, and raised his hand.

From the surrounding trees, the remaining disciples of the Order emerged. Four in total, each marked by the veil’s corruption, their bodies half-shadow, half-flesh. They moved like memories—uncertain, flickering, but full of intent. The kind of things the forest would rather forget but could not.

Elmira drew her branch-dagger.

“No,” Arlyn said between notes. “Keep singing.”

Elmira hesitated—then nodded.

“I’ll hold them.”

With that, Arlyn stepped forward, Rootblade raised, the Song blooming from her mouth even as the first of the shadows lunged.

Combat inside the Hollow was never simple. Roots shifted. Trees intervened. Light bent to favor those it believed in. Arlyn had no training, not in the way soldiers did, but the Rootblade guided her—nudging her body before she knew what to do, tilting her weight when she needed to lean, pushing her forward when fear would have made her stay still.

She did not slash. She cleaved. Memory, grief, doubt—all the things her enemies carried like armor—were torn away in the Rootblade’s arc. It did not kill them. It revealed them. The first disciple crumbled into a weeping boy, clutching a withered flower. The second dissolved into mist with a sigh of regret.

But they kept coming.

Elmira’s voice didn’t falter. She was singing now with eyes closed, her hands outstretched. Around her, the Veilbark trees echoed her tone, their glimmering bark pulsing in sync with her melody. She sang not to fight but to remember—to steady the Hollow’s breath, to keep the Song from breaking.

And then the leader stepped forward.

Not fast. Not reckless.

He walked with purpose.

“You’re brave,” he said to Arlyn as he approached. “But brave things die the loudest.”

She didn’t answer. She raised her blade.

He raised his hand—and the air behind him exploded outward.

The Hollow screamed.

Not in words. Not in pain. But in loss.

Dozens of trees folded inward as if bowing to something ancient and cruel. The ground cracked. Flowers bled color. Even the birds fled.

He had broken something.

“Your Song is only strong while the Hollow listens,” he said. “But I’ve taught it to forget.”

Arlyn staggered back. Her voice faltered. The Song wobbled, began to fade—

And Elmira’s voice rose to fill the gap.

Stronger.

Clearer.

Sharper.

She was glowing now—not flickering like before, but burning. Her body shimmered with the gold-white light of rootfire, her wings flared wide, her eyes bright as dawn after storm.

“I am not your memory,” Elmira shouted over the noise. “I am not your shadow. I am here. I was born of mistake, yes—but I chose to stay.”

The leader turned toward her.

“You shouldn’t exist.”

“I do.”

And then she sang a note Arlyn had never heard before—piercing, ancient, made of wind and sap and longing. It wasn’t part of the Song they had learned. It was older. Forgotten.

It came from deep inside her. A note only a sprite not given but made could sing.

And the Hollow listened.

Every tree leaned in. Every stone held still. The air itself turned to glass and then shattered. The disciples of the Order fell back, hands covering their ears, shapes unravelling.

Arlyn rose.

Her voice returned.

Together, she and Elmira sang—not as bearers of a tradition, but as the ones who had chosen to carry what had been abandoned. The Song now had roots in both of them. And the Hollow echoed with a sound not heard since the first Warden’s fall.

The leader bared his teeth. Bark cracked along his arms, leaking black sap.

“No,” he said. “No more Wardens. No more Crowns. We closed the gate for a reason!”

“And now you fear it opening,” Arlyn said. “Because you know you were wrong.”

“I ended the war.”

“No,” Elmira said. “You paused it.”

The Hollow answered.

A tremor spread from the grove’s center. From the roots of the central veilbark tree, light surged upward—veins of silver and green curling into the sky. The trees around them lit one by one, each joining the Song in their own tone. It became a chorus of past and present, of names remembered and names reclaimed.

The Rootblade pulsed like a heart. The markings on Arlyn’s arm flared.

And the Song reached its crescendo.

The Order fell.

Not burned, not slain—but undone. Their forms peeled away into whispers. The rot-crowned leader stumbled, bark crumbling from his face, revealing a man too old and too tired to hate anymore.

“I only wanted peace,” he whispered.

Arlyn lowered her blade.

“You could’ve had it. If you’d just let the forest grow.”

He bowed his head—and vanished like ash caught in spring wind.

The Hollow sighed.

It was over.

But the Song still played, softer now. Echoing.

Arlyn fell to her knees.

Elmira joined her, breath shallow, her glow dimming slowly.

“We did it,” she whispered.

Arlyn nodded. “The forest sang with us.”

And somewhere, far beyond the Hollow’s edge, the first rains in years fell upon Wensgrove’s cracked fields.

The world was listening again.

The Hollow did not speak in words, but in feeling. In the moments after the final verse, the Veilbark Grove stood still—not with tension, not with fear, but with fullness. The kind of stillness that only follows something sacred. The kind that roots remember. The trees glimmered in soft pulses, responding not just to the sound but to the truth of it. Truth had been sung, and truth was what the Hollow craved more than anything.

Arlyn sat in the grass, her legs folded beneath her, the Rootblade across her lap, its pulse faint now, as though resting. She was trembling. Not from fear or pain—but from the weight. Carrying a song was not like wielding a sword. It left echoes. Not wounds, but reverberations. She could feel the Hollow’s memory pressing into her now, not in words, but as presence.

Elmira lay nearby, propped on one elbow, her light dim but steady. The edge of her wing had torn slightly in the clash, the shimmer dulled, but she didn’t seem to notice. Her eyes were open, and they were watching Arlyn—not out of duty, but with something else. A kind of quiet recognition.

“I thought the Song would end,” Arlyn said after a long silence.

“It doesn’t,” Elmira replied. “It only waits for someone new to carry it.”

They said nothing for a while. All around them, the forest sighed with relief, with grief, with remembrance. New shoots were already emerging from the earth, curling through the cracked bark where the Order had stood. Life returned to fill the space left by absence.

Arlyn looked at her hands. The runes left by the Veilbark still glowed softly along her skin. They didn’t hurt, but she could feel them deep within her—singing, always singing, even when her voice was still.

“I saw him,” she said quietly. “The man who led them. I saw what he was before the rot.”

Elmira shifted closer, resting her back against the base of a tree. “What did he want?”

“Peace,” Arlyn said. “But not the kind that grows. The kind that freezes. He thought the Hollow would forget if it stayed quiet long enough. He thought silence would heal everything.”

Elmira closed her eyes. “He was half-right. Silence does heal. But not if it’s afraid.”

Arlyn nodded. “He tried to cut out all the voices that remembered pain. But the Hollow is made of pain. Of memory. You can’t separate one from the other.”

They fell silent again. The canopy above slowly shifted from green to indigo. Dusk filtered down like dust from a slow, breathing sky. Crickets began to chirp, soft and unhurried. Everything around them had slowed—not because it was weary, but because the Hollow had exhaled at last.

Then Elmira stirred.

“We can’t stay here.”

Arlyn frowned. “Why not? It’s over.”

“No.” Elmira looked eastward, toward the curve of the horizon where the Hollow met the lands beyond. “This battle is over. But the Hollow isn’t the only thing waking.”

Arlyn followed her gaze. Something beyond the trees shimmered. A ripple, like heat rising from stone, passed along the edge of the woods.

“There are places where the Song never reached,” Elmira said. “Places that were unmade during the war. They’re stirring now. They felt what we did.”

Arlyn rose to her feet. She was tired—deeply, into her marrow—but not finished. The Rootblade lifted easily in her hand. “What happens if they rise?”

Elmira stood beside her. “Then we’ll go to them. With the Song. With the Hollow’s truth. And remind them that they’re not forgotten.”

They left the Grove that night.

No trail marked their passage. The Hollow shifted behind them, sealing the Veilbark Grove in a silence that was not loss, but rest. A seed tucked safely into earth. The Thorn had sung. The Hollow had remembered. But the world was wide, and memory was not bound by borders.

In the village of Wensgrove, the rains returned for the first time in six seasons. Crops that had withered into husks began to stand straighter. Children danced barefoot in the mud while their parents wept openly in doorways. The old chapel bell tolled once, though no hand touched its rope.

In the orchard behind Arlyn’s childhood home, a single tree that had stood bare for years began to blossom—first one flower, then a dozen, then hundreds. White petals opened to drink the light of stars.

Inside Gran’s abandoned study, the books that had refused to burn whispered softly as wind brushed their pages. One book—its spine cracked, its margins filled with scribbled notes—glowed faintly.

The Song was still singing.

Far beyond the Hollow, in the ruins of a citadel drowned in sand, a woman with skin like polished obsidian opened her eyes for the first time in a century. Her breath tasted of ash and salt. Around her, glyphs carved into stone cracked and spilled light.

She rose slowly. Her joints creaked, her bones heavy with names once spoken only in fear.

She heard the Song.

And she smiled.

Arlyn and Elmira crossed the Hollow’s eastern edge by sunrise. The roots thinned there. The air grew crisper. The forest became uncertain.

But the Song went with them.

It sang not in triumph, but in truth.

It was the melody of something once broken, now becoming whole.

And though neither of them spoke, they both knew:

This was only the middle of the story.

Their journey eastward from the Hollow took them through borderlands of unraveling magic. The path, if it could be called one, was a shifting seam between memory and wilderness, where the laws of the forest no longer held firm. Stones moved overnight. Shadows drifted in directions no sun could explain. Once, they passed a tree whose leaves whispered apologies in the voice of a child neither of them knew.

These were the margins—the edges of what had once been part of the great Greenwoven before the war. And though time had tried to bleach away the old stories, Arlyn could feel them just beneath the surface. Every step forward was like placing her foot on half-buried runes.

Elmira walked ahead, her wings unfurled slightly to catch the tension in the air. She had not slept since the Grove, not in the true way of creatures who needed rest. Something in her had changed. She moved differently now, as though her rootfire had deepened and caught flame.

“You don’t look tired,” Arlyn said, catching up to her.

“I’m beyond tired,” Elmira replied. “But the Song fills the places where sleep once lived.”

They passed under an arch of fallen stone, half-swallowed by moss. Symbols pulsed faintly on its underside. Elmira traced a finger over them.

“These wards used to hum. Now they flicker like candlelight. The veil is fraying faster than I thought.”

Arlyn looked beyond the ruins. The landscape opened into low hills blanketed in thin grass and old scars—burned patches where nothing grew, rings of ironwood petrified mid-bloom, distant towers now half-consumed by root or rust. Once, these lands had been gardens, shaped by sprite-song and tended by those who walked between bark and flame.

“Do you think we’re strong enough?” she asked quietly.

Elmira didn’t answer right away.

Then: “Not yet. But we’re not finished becoming.”

They camped that night beneath the curved shell of an ancient creature’s ribcage, long since fossilized into stone and root. Arlyn sat with her back against one of the bones, the Rootblade resting beside her, its pulse slower now, matching the pace of her breath.

“You’ve stopped humming,” Elmira said.

“I don’t need to anymore,” Arlyn replied. “The Song’s inside now. It’s part of everything.”

Elmira stared into the fire. “Do you think that’s how Altheya felt?”

“No,” Arlyn said. “She carried it alone. She never had a second voice to echo her.”

A silence passed between them, gentle but deep.

“You’ll never have to carry it alone,” Elmira said at last. “Not while I still breathe.”

Arlyn looked at her. “Even if this leads to something worse than what we faced?”

Elmira smiled. “Especially then.”

They sat together until the fire sank low and the wind sang through the bones above. Beyond the firelight, the stars bent slightly—as though listening to a story that had not yet reached its ending.

In a hall built from bone and brass, buried deep beneath the wastes beyond the Hollow, an assembly stirred. Their faces were covered not with masks, but with illusions—each one a reflection of what they had sacrificed to remain unseen. There were twelve of them. Eleven sang low, ancient songs of control and tethering. The twelfth—the newest, the youngest—remained silent.

“She is moving,” said one, her voice sharp as obsidian.

“She has sung,” said another, heavier. “And she was heard.”

The youngest stood. His voice trembled when he spoke. “She carries the Thorn.”

The others turned toward him in a single motion.

“Then we must prepare,” said the eldest. “If she brings light, we will meet her with shadow.”

“If she brings truth?”

“Then we teach her how truth breaks.”

The twelve began to sing again—not like Arlyn had, not with reverence—but with will. With the cold, structured rhythm of command. Their voices fell like chains through the dark.

Outside, the stone groaned.

The world was beginning to remember itself.

In the dreamroot—an ancient web of consciousness woven through every tree older than memory—a new strand grew.

It was neither seed nor sprout.

It was Arlyn’s voice, twined with Elmira’s.

Not a warning.

A promise.

And the Hollow, though it had no face, smiled in its own way.

It had waited so long to be heard again.

Now, it would never forget.

Chapter Seven: Ashroots and Echoes

The land beyond the Hollow had no name, though once, long ago, it had many.

Here, the forest did not grow so much as linger—remnants of old trees locked in a state of stubborn decay, their trunks silvered with ash, their leaves long since turned to dust. The ground was hard, lined with veins of ancient soot and shallow roots that pulsed faintly in the dark like sleeping nerves. Every breath tasted of fire not long passed, but long remembered.

Arlyn stepped lightly, the Rootblade at her back. Its hum was distant now, as though hesitant in this space. The Song inside her was quieter too, not muted but listening. This was not the Hollow. This was not a place of living memory. This was where memory had come to die.

Elmira walked beside her, her glow reduced to a dim halo, barely visible in the dim light. The further they moved into this place, the more her presence seemed to bend inward. Even her wings drooped slightly, the soft curve of exhaustion taking root in her shoulders.

“This is wrong,” she murmured.

Arlyn looked around. “What is?”

Elmira touched one of the ash-covered trunks they passed. It crumbled beneath her fingers, but no dust fell. “These trees—they were Hollow once. Sprites lived in them. We sang them awake each season. But now…”

Arlyn saw it too. The bark had no texture, no scent. The rings in the wood were still, yes, but not from time. From removal. The place felt carved out of the world, a memory vacuumed clean. And something had done this on purpose.

“We’re in the Hollow’s scar,” Arlyn said.

“No,” Elmira corrected. “We’re in its silence.”

They continued east, each step heavier, each breath slower. The air here didn’t flow—it lingered. Not oppressive, but stagnant. Arlyn reached for the Song inside her again, whispering a line of it beneath her breath, hoping for the quiet, steady comfort it had brought in the days since the Grove.

It didn’t answer.

Instead, a single note rang in her mind, cold and dry.

A warning.

“Something’s listening,” Arlyn said.

Elmira turned, her eyes sharp again. “Where?”

Arlyn pointed—not toward a sound or movement, but toward a pressure, like standing at the base of a hill that had no peak. “That way. It’s faint. But it’s… aware.”

Elmira stepped in front. “We’re not alone anymore.”

The terrain changed as they descended a slope of scorched vine. The roots here were exposed, twisted into massive cords that crossed over one another like the ribs of a long-dead beast. At the base of the slope, they reached what could only be called a gate—but not of stone or bark.

It was woven of ashroots—interlocked strands of pale, dead vine, spiraling outward in a perfect oval. No hinges. No opening. No passage.

But the shape of it said clearly: this is a threshold.

Elmira stepped closer. “It’s a false gate.”

Arlyn frowned. “Meaning?”

“It doesn’t open. It asks.”

Arlyn looked more closely and saw it: the vines didn’t block the way entirely. Between the strands, faint markings had been carved—not with blade or claw, but with song. Each rune hummed softly at her approach, not in welcome, but in recognition. They were waiting.

She stepped forward and raised her hand.

The Rootblade vibrated on her back.

She sang a single note—low, uncertain.

Nothing happened.

Elmira stepped beside her, voice gentler. “Try again. Not the Song. Not the Warden’s melody. Try you.”

Arlyn hesitated. Then she opened her mouth and sang—not the sacred tones she’d been given, but the lullaby Gran used to hum in the dark, the half-remembered tune she’d whispered to herself when the world felt too wide.

The ashroot gate shivered.

Then it melted into air.

Beyond it was a corridor of stone and soot, descending at an angle too sharp for nature.

“Something buried itself,” Elmira said. “Something that didn't want to be followed.”

Arlyn nodded and stepped inside.

The tunnel was dry, the walls slick with veins of obsidian root. The air throbbed faintly, like a drum echoing in a distant body. As they moved deeper, the silence changed—it became too silent. Not the stillness of peace, but the vacuum of something hollowed out.

Then they heard the whispers.

Not words. Not even breath.

But remnants of speech.

Arlyn paused. “Do you hear that?”

Elmira nodded grimly. “It’s echo-song. Ghost harmonics. Someone tried to sing here a long time ago, and the walls haven’t forgotten.”

The whispers grew louder. Not aggressive. Not pleading.

Just... stuck.

Caught in a loop.

They passed chambers filled with strange remnants—altars of thorn and crystal, broken circles etched into the floor, stone bowls filled with long-dried sap. The farther they descended, the more Arlyn felt the Song inside her tug sideways, off-pitch, off-pattern. It didn’t want to follow.

At the end of the corridor, they reached a vault. Its door was a massive slab of ironwood, blackened but intact. On its surface was carved a single, simple shape: a crown split in two.

“Another Warden?” Arlyn asked.

Elmira shook her head. “No. This wasn’t a Warden’s place. This was a prison.”

Arlyn stepped forward, heart pounding. The Rootblade pulsed again, but weakly, as if reluctant to interfere.

Then a voice echoed from within the vault—not memory, not echo.

Present.

Awake.

“You’ve come further than the others.”

Elmira drew her blade. “Who’s there?”

The voice sighed, and the door rippled like a pond struck by wind.

“I am the one the Song broke,” it said. “The first echo that failed.”

And the vault began to open.

The vault door did not creak, groan, or grind. It simply vanished, as if the space that once held it had decided it no longer belonged. Arlyn raised the Rootblade instinctively, but the blade remained quiet. Not inert—quiet. Listening, like everything else in this place.

The room beyond was neither tomb nor hall. It was circular, made of layered stone and petrified vine. The air pulsed with a heavy, old energy, not magical, but emotional. The scent of damp ash hung like a veil. Faint patterns spiraled along the walls, carved not by hand or chisel but by time itself—natural inscriptions etched by pressure and age, like wrinkles in the earth’s face.

In the center of the chamber stood a figure.

Not living. Not dead.

He was carved from blackroot, but his posture was human, and his features—though half-covered in moss and cracking lichen—still bore the unmistakable weight of sorrow. Around his chest and limbs, veins of golden light pulsed intermittently, like breath too slow to be alive. His eyes were closed, and yet his voice had spoken. And when he moved, it was as if the stone beneath him remembered being flesh.

“You are not the first to come here,” he said, without opening his eyes.

Arlyn took a cautious step forward. “What are you?”

“I was a Warden once,” he said, voice like leaves underfoot. “Not a crowned one. Not a chosen. But I sang the Song before it was called that. I bled it before it was bound in words. They called me Tharo.”

Elmira’s eyes widened. “Tharo the Echoed. The one who failed to close the breach.”

Tharo finally opened his eyes. They were hollow, yet lit from within, like lanterns burning behind ancient paper.

“I did not fail,” he said. “I chose to stop singing.”

Arlyn swallowed. “Why?”

“Because I saw what the Song could become. What it demands. Memory is not harmless. It is not sacred. It consumes.”

He reached out a hand, and a spiral of light formed in the air before him—an image of forests turning to flame, of creatures caught in the web of remembrance until they unraveled. “The Song keeps the Hollow alive, but it binds the world to its past. What is old remains old. What is broken never heals. It only echoes.”

Elmira stepped forward. “But the Hollow grows again.”

“Yes,” Tharo said, tilting his head. “And I felt it. Your Song awakened the root within me. But you do not understand what grows with it.”

Arlyn lowered her blade slightly. “Then teach us.”

“You want to carry the Crown,” Tharo said. “But the Crown is not a symbol. It is a sacrifice. Every bearer gives more than a name. They give their future. The Song grows because someone becomes its soil.”

Arlyn was quiet for a long time. Then: “I saw that. In the Veilrise. I saw myself alone. I saw you too, I think—only your face was shadowed.”

“That was my burden,” he said. “And when I laid it down, the Hollow buried me. Not as punishment. As warning.”

Elmira glanced at Arlyn. “He’s not just an echo. He’s the first memory the Hollow tried to forget.”

Tharo’s gaze turned to Elmira now. “And you, flicker-born. You were never meant to walk this path. And yet, here you are. A voice that does not belong. A note without key.”

“I don’t care if I don’t belong,” Elmira said, her tone like sharpened bark. “I’m still singing.”

Tharo’s expression softened. “And that, perhaps, is what makes you necessary.”

He stepped forward—not walking, but gliding, his form drifting more than moving. The chamber responded to him: roots untangled, lights shifted. And in his hand, he conjured something small—an orb of bark and glass, wrapped in glowing sigils.

“This is what remains of the Forgotten Verse,” he said. “It is the part of the Song that was cut away, too dangerous to be remembered.”

Arlyn took it from him, gently.

The moment her fingers touched the orb, it sank into her palm, disappearing like water into soil.

And then she remembered.

A verse with no melody.

A note that wounded.

A sound that unmade instead of mending.

She staggered.

Elmira caught her. “What did you see?”

Arlyn blinked, breath caught in her throat. “It was the part of the Song meant to be silenced. A note of grief so deep it turns into unbeing.”

Tharo nodded. “That verse is the truth the Hollow fears. It is the voice of loss before healing. You must not sing it unless you mean to burn everything to root and ash.”

Arlyn steadied herself. “Why give it to me?”

“Because you may need it,” he said. “If the other world rises. If the unrooted remember what they lost and choose to take it back.”

Elmira exhaled. “So the Thorn isn’t the end.”

“No,” Tharo said. “It is the beginning of endings. And the crown you seek does not sit atop a head. It rests on the world’s edge—where root meets ruin.”

He began to fade then, the light from within dimming, his limbs stiffening.

“Wait,” Arlyn said. “Will we see you again?”

“Perhaps,” Tharo whispered. “If the Song needs another verse.”

And then he was stone once more.

They emerged from the vault hours later, the ashroot gate closing behind them with a sigh.

The world above had darkened. The sky was strange—bruised and fractured, clouds curling in slow, unnatural spirals. A wind had risen, one that did not move the trees, only their shadows.

“We woke something,” Elmira said.

Arlyn looked down at her hand, where the sigils of the Forgotten Verse now glowed faintly beneath her skin.

“No,” she said. “We uncovered something that never stopped waiting.”

They didn’t speak again until camp was made, a small fire crackling between them beneath the remnants of a sky that seemed to flinch at every flicker of light.

Elmira sat sharpening her branch-dagger, her fingers steady.

“You’ll know when to use it,” she said.

Arlyn nodded, her eyes distant.

“And if I don’t?”

“Then I’ll sing with you anyway.”

The Song, even now, had not stopped. It had only grown quieter.

Waiting for the next verse.

The following morning, the sky broke open.

Not with storm, nor fire, nor song—but with silence so deep it pressed against the bones. The birds were gone. Even the wind that had circled them in the night had vanished. Arlyn woke to the stillness, sensing it like a weight on her chest. When she sat up, Elmira was already standing, facing the east, her wings rigid, her glow muted to a pale flicker.

“They’re coming,” she said.

Arlyn joined her, brushing frost from her cloak. It hadn’t been cold during the night, but the grass around them glittered with a silvery sheen—dew turned brittle, unnatural. Ahead, past the jagged rocks and ash-torn hollows, the ridgeline shimmered with faint movement.

Shapes moved along the horizon. Not men. Not creatures.

Thoughts given form. Shadows wrapped in cloaks of undone memory. They shifted as they moved—faces folding inward, arms blooming into tendrils, features dissolving and reforming. Echoes. Echoes of a people who had once tried to sever themselves from the Hollow’s voice.

“The Unrooted,” Arlyn whispered.

Elmira’s lips tightened. “The ones who chose forgetting. Now they come to silence what remains.”

They stood in silence, watching as the shapes marched, slow and deliberate, across the ridge and into the lands that once bore names.

“They were Hollow once,” Elmira said. “They walked under the same trees. But they feared what the Song showed them. So they carved it out.”

“And now that it sings again,” Arlyn said, “they want to unmake it.”

“We have time,” Elmira said. “Not much. But time enough to reach the Crown.”

Arlyn looked at her sharply. “You said the Crown wasn’t a place.”

“It’s not. But there is a place where it takes root. A last grove. One that only opens when the Song is whole.”

“And you think we’re ready?”

Elmira met her gaze. “We’re not. But the Song is. That’s what matters.”

They packed in silence and moved with the wind, walking the edge of the world where the Hollow’s memory began to fade. The path they took was narrow—threaded between what had once been called the Borderlands and what now whispered only in ruin. Every step brought them closer to the place where bark turned to bone, where the first verse of the Song had been sung and then abandoned.

And with each mile, the Verse of Forgetting burned a little brighter under Arlyn’s skin.

It didn’t hurt. But it reminded her, every heartbeat, that memory was dangerous. That knowing too much, carrying too deeply, left scars. The Song was not salvation. It was reckoning.

That night, they camped near a pool of black water that did not reflect the stars. Arlyn watched the surface for a long time, listening to the quiet hum in her blood. She could feel the Hollow in her still, but distant now—as though it had released her to her task. As though it knew she would not return the same.

Elmira lay nearby, her eyes open, not blinking.

“We may not come back from this,” Arlyn said softly.

“I know.”

“But I’d rather go forward with you than go back alone.”

Elmira turned her head slightly. “Then sing with me. When the time comes.”

Arlyn nodded. “I will.”

And with that, they drifted into uneasy sleep, the horizon waiting just beyond reach, and the shadow of the Crown beginning to bloom beneath the soil of the world.

Chapter Eight: Where the Crown Takes Root

The land grew stranger as they drew near the Grove That Was Not. That was what Elmira called it—never aloud, only in quiet moments when the air was still and the stars seemed to lean in closer. It had no place on any map and bore no path to mark its approach, only signs: trees that leaned in unison toward a single point, moss that grew in perfect spirals, and the deepening thrum beneath their feet—a rhythm that did not match their steps but guided them all the same.

Arlyn felt it in her spine. The Song, fuller now than ever before, sang quietly inside her. Not words, not verses, but presence. Every part of her—mind, breath, memory—had been tuned. She didn’t hum anymore, didn’t even think in silence. The Song had become her second pulse.

Elmira walked a pace ahead, drawn by something not entirely of the Hollow. Her glow had returned, steadier and warmer, as if her proximity to the Grove That Was Not had ignited something deeper in her rootfire. She didn’t speak much now, but Arlyn knew her thoughts were close. They didn’t need to speak to be understood anymore.

Their path wound through glades of impossible shape—triangular meadows, rivers that flowed in spirals and vanished into stone, trees whose shadows reached in directions their trunks did not. The world here had bent around something ancient, as if the Crown’s presence warped the shape of time and space just by being near.

On the fourth day, they saw the boundary.

A ring of trees, tall and white as bone, circled an open field. Each tree bore no leaves, only slivers of bark that shimmered with violet light. No branches stretched out; instead, they pointed inward, all facing the same center.

And at the center of the ring, something pulsed beneath the earth.

Arlyn approached the threshold, her steps slowing as the hum of the Song surged within her. Her skin burned—not with fire, but recognition. The Forgotten Verse in her palm tingled, then dimmed, retreating. This was not a place for unmaking.

This was where the world grew whole.

Elmira stepped up beside her, eyes wide. “It’s waiting.”

“For what?”

“For you.”

Arlyn passed between the white trees, her breath catching the moment she crossed the threshold. Sound fell away—not silence, but stillness, like standing in the moment between inhale and exhale. Even the wind dared not pass.

The field was bare. No grass. No flowers. Just soil. But Arlyn knew. The Crown wasn’t hidden. It was buried. Waiting to rise.

She stepped to the center, her boots sinking slightly into the soft, warm earth. She knelt, placing one hand on the ground.

The Song inside her sharpened.

“I carry the memory,” she whispered. “Of what was broken. Of what was given. I carry the pain.”

Beneath her hand, the soil pulsed. Not light. Not magic. Life.

“I carry the Song,” she said. “And I am not alone.”

Elmira stepped forward then, and knelt beside her. She placed her hand beside Arlyn’s.

“I am not root,” Elmira said. “Not born of bark. But I am the echo.”

The Grove responded.

From beneath the soil, tendrils of root curled upward, not threatening, but searching. They wrapped around Arlyn’s arms, cradled her wrists, traced the runes etched in her skin. Around Elmira, smaller tendrils shimmered, their glow pulsing in sync with the soft light of her wings.

And then, slowly, the earth split.

A single shoot pushed upward.

It was not a crown in the way stories told—no metal, no gems, no arcane fire. It was a living thing. A ring of intertwined branches, half-bud, half-blossom, thick with sap and memory. Flowers bloomed from its weave. Thorns curled along its inner rim, not sharp enough to wound but sharp enough to remind.

Arlyn reached out. Her fingers closed around the base of the living crown.

It didn’t flare or burst or sing.

It simply settled.

The moment her hands wrapped around it, she understood.

The Warden’s crown was not an artifact.

It was a burden willingly accepted.

It was weight and vow and root.

And it was hers.

She placed it upon her brow.

The forest did not roar. The sky did not split.

But the world shifted.

She felt it in the tilt of the trees. The way the wind found its rhythm again. The subtle change in the way shadows bent—not away, but toward her. The Hollow breathed.

Elmira rose beside her. “They’ll know now.”

“I know,” Arlyn said.

The light around them dimmed.

Across the world, in places that had forgotten the Hollow’s name, people felt a stirring in their bones. Dreams bent. Ash moved. Something old had returned.

And the Unrooted, still gathering in the wasted lands to the east, paused.

They had not forgotten the crown.

And they would not allow it to bloom.

They did not linger in the Grove.

The Crown rested on Arlyn’s head, its branches woven so closely into her hair it seemed they had grown there. Every step she took resonated with purpose now, with connection—not control. She did not command the Hollow. She carried it. A channel. A vessel. The Song was louder now, always just beneath her skin, a harmony she no longer had to sing aloud to understand.

Elmira stayed close. She had not changed visibly, but Arlyn could feel it in her. The forest had accepted her completely. The echo had become part of the root. Whatever strange magic had sparked her into being, it had been confirmed—not just allowed, but embraced.

They crested the rise that marked the final edge of Hollow memory, looking out over a stretch of grey, dust-laced plain that cracked like dry bark beneath the sun.

“They’re waiting for us,” Arlyn said.

“Yes,” Elmira said. “But they’re not ready for what we’ve become.”

“We don’t go to destroy them.”

“No. We go to remind them.”

The last part of the Song—the final chorus—was still unwritten.

And the world was listening.


They descended into the basin of broken earth by starlight.

Here, the world remembered war not through ruins but through absence. There were no trees, no rivers, no birdsong. The plain stretched vast and barren, interrupted only by ridges of stone shaped by forgotten magics and scorch-marks where something far older than flame had once touched the ground. The Hollow’s breath no longer reached this place—not because it was stopped, but because it had been severed.

Yet Arlyn felt the Song stir even here.

Not loud. Not vibrant. But present.

The Crown sat lightly upon her brow, its thorns warming in the cool night air, petals occasionally shifting with thought. It no longer pulsed—it listened. As if it knew that what came next was not to be sung at the Hollow’s center, but at its furthest edge.

Elmira stepped carefully beside her, boots crunching over dry crystal. Her light had become subtle now, no longer bright or burning but woven into her skin like threads of starlight. She no longer cast shadows. She moved like one.

They crested a ridge just before dawn.

Below, they saw them.

The Unrooted.

Hundreds gathered in silent formations—no banners, no encampments, no fires. They did not need warmth. They were not people in the ordinary sense anymore. They were memory unmoored, belief stripped of connection, fragments who had chosen to live without the burden of history. Each bore some remnant of their broken past—shattered amulets, barkless staves, swords that glimmered only when turned away from the moon.

They looked up as one.

And they saw the Crown.

The murmuring began—not in words, but in intention.

They began to move.

Arlyn did not reach for the Rootblade.

She stepped forward alone, Elmira at her side.

She sang.

A single note—low, clear, rising.

It was not the Warden’s call. It was not the Song that turned trees or cracked stone.

It was a greeting.

A name returned.

The Unrooted paused.

The earth between them shivered.

From within their ranks, a tall figure emerged. His face was veiled in smoke, his body cloaked in threads of forgotten sigils. Where he stepped, the ground did not crack—it sighed.

He raised one hand. “You carry it.”

Arlyn nodded. “The Hollow’s memory. The crown that never died.”

“You should not have returned.”

“I didn’t,” she said. “I grew. There’s a difference.”

The figure tilted his head. “You bring us what we cut away.”

“I bring you the choice,” Arlyn said. “To remember, or remain unrooted. But the Song has returned. And you can’t unmake what’s been replanted.”

Another note followed, this time from Elmira—a thread of sound so quiet it nearly slipped into silence. But it held.

Together, they sang again.

Not a war cry. Not a challenge.

A bridge.

And something moved in the Unrooted.

A flicker.

A tremor.

Then one stepped forward. A woman with roots twined in her hair, her fingers bare, her eyes wet. She sang too—just a note. Broken. Hoarse.

Another followed.

Then a third.

The Song began to spread—not because it was taught, but because it was remembered.

Some did not sing. Some stepped back. Some vanished.

But others remained. And the basin was no longer quiet.

It echoed.

The Crown pulsed.

The Veil shuddered far behind them.

And Arlyn knew—they were not finished.

They were becoming.

She turned to Elmira. “What now?”

Elmira smiled. “Now we walk again. The Hollow has many roots yet to wake.”

And beneath their feet, where only dust had lingered, the first green shoot broke through the stone.


Dawn reached the plain slowly, hesitantly, as if uncertain whether it was welcome.

The first rays touched the gathered forms of the Unrooted, casting long shadows behind them. Many still stood silent, unmoving, their faces unreadable beneath veils and scars and hollowness. Yet the Song—Arlyn’s Song, Elmira’s echo, and the echoes born in the mouths of strangers—had not stopped. It lingered. It threaded through the stillness like dew clinging to stone.

No one declared peace. No banners were lowered, no rites recited. But something had shifted. There had been no battle, and yet a victory had occurred—not of domination, but of restoration.

A beginning. Again.

Arlyn stood at the rise overlooking the plain, her voice resting now, though the Song hummed through her bones. The Crown on her brow had softened, the petals fully opened, dew gathered at the thorns, as if the crown itself breathed with her. The Song was no longer a power she used. It was her presence. A name she carried in place of her own.

She looked over her shoulder at Elmira, who sat on a stone, legs drawn up, arms wrapped around her knees.

“They’re going to follow us,” Arlyn said softly.

Elmira nodded. “Not all.”

“No. But enough.”

It would not be easy. Some of the Unrooted had only just begun to feel again. Others would resist entirely, clinging to the silence they had chosen. But a seed had been planted in the basin. In memory. In voice.

In hope.

“I’m afraid,” Arlyn admitted. “There’s still so much I don’t know. The Song is too big. The pain is too old.”

Elmira stood and walked to her. “Then we grow into it. One root at a time.”

They descended the rise once more.

Where there had been only dry plain, tufts of green had begun to emerge—tentative, pale, like something waking from deep sleep. The Unrooted parted for them, slowly, not with reverence but with acknowledgment. Arlyn met their eyes as she passed. Some blinked. Some wept.

None looked away.

Near the center of the gathered mass, the woman who had sung first stepped forward.

She held out a hand.

In her palm was a shard of broken crystal, wrapped in vine—a fragment of an old Warden's sigil, long thought lost.

“I want to remember,” she said.

Arlyn closed her fingers over the shard.

“You will,” she said. “All of you can. If you choose.”

That was the final piece. Not the Forgotten Verse, not the Grove, not even the Crown.

Choice.

The right to remember.

The courage to sing.

They walked east in the days that followed—not fleeing, not chasing, but guiding. The Hollow did not end at its roots. Wherever memory could grow, wherever voices lifted, it could bloom again.

Villages they passed slowed their steps to listen. Towns paused their harvests to follow a song that none of them fully knew, but somehow all recognized. The Thornbearer did not command them. She called them. Not in fire, but in truth.

Some nights, Arlyn and Elmira sang alone beneath stars, their harmonies curling upward into the sky like prayer.

Other nights, dozens joined them.

Then hundreds.

The Song spread—not as contagion, but as invitation. Memory stitched into melody. Regret woven into forgiveness. Names once lost spoken aloud for the first time in generations.

And everywhere it spread, green returned.

Not quickly.

Not perfectly.

But honestly.

In the Hollow, Thiln stood before the Stonewake once more, wings folded tight, body lined with lichen. The stones no longer pulsed with grief. They murmured quietly now—content, but listening.

He closed his eyes.

She was still singing.

Far away, perhaps. But never again lost.

The Warden had returned.

And she did not walk alone.

The land responded slowly, as though testing whether the change was real. Beneath their feet, cracks began to close—not completely, but enough to hold seed and water. Hills once grey and skeletal took on faint tinges of ochre and green. No sudden bloom, no triumphant eruption of life. But the slow, steady breathing of a world beginning again.

Arlyn no longer thought of herself as a Warden in the old sense. There had been too many crowned and broken before her. Too many who believed the Song was theirs to command, rather than something they served. Her crown did not glitter. It did not shine. It grew. It changed. As did she.

And with each step eastward, she felt the Hollow stretch behind her—not pulling, not binding, but following. Not as a place, but as a presence. Wherever they went, it went too.

One morning, as mist curled low across a newly stirring field, Arlyn paused and turned to Elmira.

“What if no one takes up the Song after us?” she asked.

Elmira didn’t answer immediately. She crouched to touch a curling shoot rising from the earth. “They will. Not because we ask. Because something in them will remember. Even when memory hurts.”

Arlyn considered that, then nodded. “And if they don’t?”

Elmira stood and brushed her hands off. “Then the Song waits. Just like it waited for you.”

Arlyn smiled faintly. “You always sound certain.”

“I’m not. But I hope beautifully.”

That evening, as the sun slid down behind the roots of the distant ridgelands, Arlyn climbed a knoll and sang—not loudly, not to gather, but simply to mark the day. It was a new verse. Wordless. A melody only half-shaped.

Below, fires flickered quietly among those who had chosen to follow. They did not look to her for orders. They sat in small clusters, some sharing stories, some listening, some silent.

But all of them were facing the same direction.

Forward.

And when Arlyn finished, the last note lingered, caught in the breath of dusk.

Chapter Eight had come to rest.

And the Song moved on.

By the time they reached the Shattergrove, Arlyn knew something had changed again. Not within her—though that change had never stopped—but within the Hollow itself. It wasn’t a place anymore, not the way she once thought. The Hollow had seeped outward, chasing the echoes of its Song, reclaiming what had once been severed.

The Shattergrove had never been named on any map. It lived at the seam where the old kingdoms crumbled into the dead lands, where trees grew in jagged bursts and the canopy was fractured like glass. Every trunk held fissures, glowing faintly with inner light, as though each tree had cracked and then tried to heal. Wind moved strangely here. Sound did not echo. And the earth was hard as stone but warm to the touch.

“This was the last place the Unrooted tried to bind,” Elmira said as they crossed into the outer grove. “They carved silence into the trees. You can still feel it.”

Arlyn knelt beside a fallen limb. The bark was etched with thin slashes—more than glyphs, less than wounds. She traced them with her fingertips and flinched. Not from pain. From grief.

“They tried to kill the Hollow here,” she whispered. “But it sang anyway.”

The deeper they moved into the grove, the quieter everything became. Even the Song inside Arlyn dimmed, not from fear, but reverence. They passed the skeleton of what had once been a monument—a great arch of silverroot shattered into thirds. Beneath it, moss had crept in, not to erase, but to soften. Time had not been cruel here. Only truthful.

They found the Watcher near dusk.

He stood at the grove’s core, a man-shaped figure of vine and resin, grown into a tree but still faintly human in form. His face was a mask of bark. His arms were folded into his chest, cradling something that pulsed.

“He’s old,” Elmira said. “Maybe older than even Tharo.”

“Alive?” Arlyn asked.

“Yes. But not in the way we are. He listens.”

Arlyn stepped forward. The Crown upon her head responded, its thorns tightening ever so slightly—not in warning, but in preparation. As she neared the Watcher, the Song within her shifted.

A single note broke the stillness, low and aching.

The Watcher opened his eyes.

They were hollow—deep sockets filled with spirals of light. When he spoke, it was not with a voice but with presence.

“You carry the last bloom.”

Arlyn bowed her head. “I do.”

“And the first.”

She looked up.

He was right.

She was no longer merely bearing a continuation.

She was shaping the first Song of a new cycle.

“Will they resist again?” she asked.

“They always do.”

“Will we be enough?”

“You already are.”

The Watcher lifted his wooden arms. In his grasp, a small sprig glowed—a tiny blossom, unlike anything Arlyn had seen. Petals the color of old fire. A center that pulsed like a heartbeat. He handed it to her.

“This is the Song that remembers pain and does not end in silence.”

Arlyn took it.

It melted into her hand.

And the world shifted again.

That night, the dreams came—not fractured images, not fears, but memory not her own. Arlyn saw fields of broken root. A sea of branches burning blue. She saw a line of Wardens walking into fire, one by one, never turning back. She saw the faces of the Unrooted before they forgot—full of music and tears.

And then she saw a crown that did not rest on a head.

It was planted like a seed in the center of the world.

Waiting to bloom.

The next morning, the Unrooted returned.

They arrived in silence, surrounding the edges of the Shattergrove. Their faces were bare now—no masks, no illusions. They bore no weapons. They made no threats.

At their center stood a girl no older than Arlyn had been when she first wandered the Hollow's edge. Her hair was streaked with soot and blossom-pink, her arms painted with spirals that pulsed faintly in the dawn light.

She bowed.

“We heard you.”

Arlyn stepped forward. “And?”

The girl looked around the grove. “Some of us want to remember again. Even if it hurts.”

“Then help us carry it,” Arlyn said. “Help us plant what comes next.”

One by one, the Unrooted came forward. They touched the trees, the earth, the cracked monuments. They knelt. Not to worship, but to begin.

And the Song that had traveled from root to ruin began its return.

They stayed in the Shattergrove for seven days.

Each day, a piece of the old silence lifted. Flowers returned. Birds began to nest in branches they once feared. Even the stones hummed faintly at dusk.

On the sixth night, Elmira sang alone by the fire. It was a sorrowful tune, low and slow, full of rain that never came and voices never answered. Arlyn watched her, saying nothing. When Elmira finished, she didn’t look up.

“That was my beginning,” she said. “The Song I sang the day I was made.”

Arlyn placed a hand on hers. “And now it’s part of the whole.”

Elmira finally looked at her. “So are you.”

They did not speak again that night, but the fire did not burn low.

It burned steady.

Waiting.

On the seventh morning, when the sun rose through the cracked trees of the Shattergrove, it brought with it color the land hadn’t seen in generations. Not the green of spring or the firegold of autumn, but something in between—a glow that shimmered like the inside of a seed just before it split open. Birds circled the upper branches. The ground, once crusted in ash and silence, was now dusted with new moss and strange, soft fungi that pulsed in rhythm with the Song Arlyn carried.

The Unrooted had not all stayed. Some vanished again, choosing solitude or paths unknown. But enough had remained to make something new. They had begun clearing the broken vines from the collapsed arch. They repaired nothing—they simply let new things grow over the wreckage. The Song did not need perfect memory. Only honest one.

Arlyn stood at the base of the rise, watching the work unfold.

“We’ve done what we came to do here,” Elmira said beside her.

Arlyn nodded. “It feels like an ending.”

“No,” Elmira said. “It feels like a place that’s no longer afraid to begin again.”

They stayed until midday, then began their journey west—not to return, but to follow. The Hollow called them onward, not as a place, but as a purpose. The Song inside them had grown richer, layered with the voices they’d heard and the silences they had survived. And as they walked, the land responded with every step.

In a valley once known as Redbramble Reach, they passed a ruined shrine. Its roof was gone, its walls marked by decades of decay. But in its center, a new tree had begun to grow—young, proud, its trunk wrapped with a braid of silver vine. At its roots, small hands had laid tokens: feathers, stones, folded paper leaves.

Children watched them pass from the hills. Some waved.

The Song passed through them like wind through long grass.

By the fifth day, Arlyn began to feel the pull again—not just of direction, but of culmination. The Song no longer moved forward blindly. It circled now, gathering toward something. A final harmony. A resolution.

They reached a ridge on the dusk of the sixth day, where the Hollow’s breath once ended.

Beyond it lay something new.

Not forest. Not plain. A field of roots.

Thousands—perhaps millions—spiraling in perfect, endless arcs. Some were thick as buildings, some thin as thread. They formed no pattern at first glance. But as Arlyn stepped closer, she understood.

It was the shape of the Song itself.

Not written in notes or symbols, but in life.

A memory so vast it could not be held in a single mind.

Elmira touched one of the larger roots. Her fingers sparked faintly. “This is where it wants to bloom.”

“The Crown?” Arlyn asked.

“No,” Elmira said. “You.”

That night, Arlyn did not sleep.

She sat alone among the roots, the Song inside her flickering like a hearthfire that refused to go out. She saw the past not as images, but as sensations—Gran’s laughter, the scent of wet bark in summer storms, the echo of her mother’s voice as she hummed beneath the windowsill. And over it all, the deeper tone of the Hollow, the one that had always waited. Always listened.

She removed the Crown for the first time.

It did not resist.

She laid it on the rootbed in front of her, where it slowly pressed into the earth, thorns first, like planting a seed.

And the earth took it.

No flash of light. No flare of song.

Just acceptance.

Elmira sat beside her in silence, not asking, not intruding.

“It doesn’t need me anymore,” Arlyn said, her voice barely above the breeze.

“No,” Elmira agreed. “But it remembers you.”

They stayed there until morning.

When the sun rose, a tree stood where Arlyn had planted the Crown.

Not tall. Not wide.

But blooming.

Its leaves were silver and green. Its bark shimmered faintly with lines that echoed the runes of her skin. At its center, a bud the color of fire and sap began to open—one petal at a time.

And far across the world, wherever the Hollow’s breath had once been silenced, flowers bloomed in its stead.

The Song had taken root.

And something new was beginning.

The tree remained still all through the morning, as if choosing its moment to truly awaken. Around its slender trunk, the roots shifted subtly, widening their spiral, creating a soft basin in the earth—a cradle of memory. The crown had vanished, absorbed not destroyed, and in its place grew something not bound to any single bearer.

This was not a monument.

It was a continuation.

A chorus shaped into bark and bud.

The Unrooted who had followed them began to arrive in ones and twos, standing at a respectful distance. None asked questions. They understood in the way deep understanding often comes—without instruction. Some knelt. Others simply watched.

A child with bark-patched hands and a satchel of bird bones placed a feather at the tree’s base. A grey-haired man, one arm wrapped in memory-cloth, hummed a note that trembled into the wind and vanished into the branches.

Even those who had not learned the Song now felt its shape.

It didn’t need to be sung to be heard anymore.

Arlyn stood at the edge of it all, her hands loose at her sides. Her hair tangled with dust and seed. The old ache of bearing the Song was gone, replaced not by lightness, but by peace. She was no longer a Warden. The role had passed beyond her, as it always must. The Song never stayed in one voice. It never truly ended. It only waited for those brave enough to carry it forward.

Elmira joined her. Her eyes, no longer glowing, still held their fierce clarity. The roots had accepted her too—not as sprite or echo or other, but simply as Elmira. Whole and true.

“It’s growing faster than I thought it would,” she said, nodding to the tree.

“It’s ready to carry what we were,” Arlyn replied. “And what comes next.”

They stood together in silence for a long time. Eventually, one of the Unrooted—a tall figure draped in vines, his arms marked with looping script—approached them. He carried a staff grown from a branch of one of the old groves, freshly cut and still alive.

“Where will you go now?” he asked Arlyn.

She looked beyond the field, toward the distant hills where birds now circled and smoke from village fires curled in the morning sky.

“Wherever the next forgetting waits,” she said. “Wherever silence has taken root too deeply.”

He bowed, not from tradition, but from gratitude.

Arlyn turned away from the tree. She did not look back. The Song did not need watching. It had grown strong enough now to stand without her voice.

Elmira walked beside her, shoulders square, steps sure.

Behind them, the tree’s blossoms opened fully.

And the world, once again, began to sing.

Chapter Ten: A Warden No Longer

The road west was quiet—not silent, but free of urgency. It curled through the new-remembered lands, where towns had begun to gather again, not under banners, but under stories. No one recognized Arlyn or Elmira on sight anymore, not because they had forgotten them, but because they had become something else.

Not symbols.

Not saviors.

Just travelers carrying something older than themselves.

They passed through villages where root-song was taught to children with wooden pipes, where sap-runes were carved on doors for blessing, where people whispered to trees not for power, but for companionship. No one asked them for miracles. No one asked them to stay.

And in each place, they stayed anyway.

Just long enough to remind the soil how to breathe.

Just long enough to listen.

Chapter Ten: A Warden No Longer

The road west was quiet—not silent, but free of urgency. It curled through the new-remembered lands, where towns had begun to gather again, not under banners, but under stories. No one recognized Arlyn or Elmira on sight anymore, not because they had forgotten them, but because they had become something else.

Not symbols.

Not saviors.

They passed through villages where root-song was taught to children with wooden pipes, where sap-runes were carved on doors for blessing, where people whispered to trees not for power, but for companionship. No one asked them for miracles. No one asked them to stay.

And in each place, they stayed anyway.

Just long enough to remind the soil how to breathe.

Just long enough to listen.

The southern road brought them to Stoneflinch, a village once known for its stubborn resistance to root or memory. Its people had stripped their trees for warmth, burned their old texts in bonfires they called “cleansings.” But even Stoneflinch had begun to stir. Wildflowers now pushed through its abandoned outer fields. A once-barren stream burbled again, and children sketched spirals in the dust—unaware, perhaps, that they were drawing echoes of the Song.

Arlyn and Elmira arrived without announcement. They walked through the crooked main street, past shuttered windows and wary glances, and stopped beside a crumbling public hearth where an old man sat with a chipped cup of bark-mead.

“You’ll not find comfort here,” he muttered, not unkindly. “We don’t take kindly to rootfolk.”

“We’re not rootfolk,” Elmira said, sitting beside him.

He looked at her again. This time more closely.

“No,” he said slowly. “I suppose you’re something else.”

Arlyn stood behind them, watching two children race across the square. One of them carried a hollow reed and blew tuneless puffs through it. But something in the rhythm caught her attention. It was off-kilter. Untrained. But familiar.

A sprouting.

She smiled.

“We’re not here to bring anything,” Arlyn said finally. “Just to listen.”

The old man considered this.

“You’ll find our silence loud,” he said after a moment.

Arlyn only nodded. “We’re used to that.”

They stayed a single night, and by morning, the old hearth had been cleared of its ash. Someone—Arlyn never found out who—had planted a seed just beneath the ashstone. It was already cracking open when they left.

They moved on.

As they traveled, the Song shifted again. Not louder, not fuller—more distant. Not because it was fading, but because it was spreading. It no longer needed to rest in Arlyn’s chest or Elmira’s light. It had rooted itself in soil, in story, in children’s breath. In feather and thorn and poem. It was becoming wild again, as it had been before it was ever named.

And in that wildness, it was safe.

They passed into the highlands near the Wexrift Mountains, where the wind carried stories instead of leaves, and the stars hummed low at night. Here, Arlyn found herself thinking often of Gran. Of the way she would murmur lullabies into old clay bowls while stirring soup, as if even food deserved song.

That memory stayed with her long after they had climbed the ridgelines and stood overlooking a valley newly blooming with anemone grass and creeping glowroot. In its center stood a lone cottage, smoke rising faintly from the chimney.

Elmira nudged her shoulder. “Looks familiar.”

Arlyn smiled. “It should.”

They descended and knocked.

A young woman opened the door.

She had curls like twined vines and a slight limp in her step. But when she spoke, it was with certainty.

“I don’t know your names,” she said, “but I think you’re expected.”

They shared soup that night. No songs were sung, but the silence between them pulsed gently. The woman—her name was Keema—explained she’d found the cottage overgrown years ago. Something had called her to it. Not a voice. A pull. She had cleared the vines, rethatched the roof, and waited.

“What for?” Arlyn asked.

Keema shrugged. “Didn’t know. Still don’t. But sometimes, knowing isn’t part of it.”

They nodded at that.

After Keema went to sleep, Arlyn sat by the fire, staring into the flames.

“Do you ever think,” she said to Elmira, “that we could stay somewhere?”

Elmira stretched out beside her. “Sometimes. But it never lasts long.”

Arlyn poked the coals with a stick. “Maybe that’s not the point. Maybe staying was never part of the Song.”

“No,” Elmira said, smiling. “But remembering is.”

The last leg of their journey took them to a cliff’s edge overlooking a vast ocean of trees—no longer fractured or gray, but green. Towering. Whole.

Below them, the Hollow stretched wide and wild, singing in the voice of a thousand leaves.

Arlyn stood with her arms loose at her sides, feeling the wind carry threads of old verses back toward her. She heard the voice of the Watcher. Of Tharo. Of Gran. She heard the crackling whisper of forgotten verses. She heard children laughing.

She heard herself.

But she did not sing.

The Song no longer needed her voice.

It had its own.

“Will it last?” she asked quietly.

Elmira stepped up beside her. “Nothing lasts. But everything roots.”

They stood there until the sun dipped below the treeline and the sky bloomed with violet dusk.

No declaration was made.

No ending was carved.

But something had settled.

Not just in the land.

In them.

They turned, side by side, and walked the edge of the Hollow—not to guard it, not to protect it, but to witness it grow.

And behind them, carried on wind and branch, came the Song. Whole. Free. Unafraid.

No longer a burden.

A gift.

And the world remembered.

They wandered for many days after leaving the cliffs. Not with purpose, not with quest. Simply walking. Listening. They followed the paths birds took, trails cut through rivergrass by stags, corridors where bark was worn away from generations of silent passing. No destination waited. The world was no longer asking them to solve or to save. It only asked them to be.

And in that being, something rare unfolded.

One evening, they found a clearing of bellwood trees—short, round-trunked, whose leaves sang when touched by wind. Elmira ran her fingers along the bark and tilted her head.

“They’re still singing the first Song.”

Arlyn lay on her back in the grass, eyes half-lidded. “Good. It should never stop.”

The bellwoods rang softly as dusk settled. Fireflies came—drawn to something deeper than scent, deeper than motion. They drifted through the trees like sparks from an unseen hearth.

That night, they didn’t speak. They only listened.

In that clearing, under the light of a swollen moon, the Song of the Hollow became something else—not a memory, not a burden, not a map to follow.

It became home.

Somewhere in the world, far from where the Hollow once bloomed and burned, a young boy bent over a patch of soil behind a cottage. He wore no sigils, bore no gifts, held no great name. In his hands, he carried a single sprout, half-wrapped in cloth. He pressed it into the dirt, covered it with care, and sat beside it as though waiting for it to speak.

He didn’t know who Arlyn was. He’d never heard of Elmira. But his mother had once sung a strange tune when she washed the windows in spring, and sometimes, when he felt the world grow heavy, that tune played quietly in his breath.

The Song had found him.

Not because someone had sent it.

Because it was ready.

In a town near the sea, three old women gathered every evening on a balcony that overlooked the harbor. They shared stories over vinewater and baked rootcakes. Their tales always ended the same: “And that was when the trees came back, without anyone asking.”

In their stories, there were no names.

Only wind, and song, and a girl with a blade made of memory who didn’t stay long.

Children listened. Most of them forgot. But some didn’t.

And when the time came, those few hummed while planting things.

They didn’t know why.

Only that it felt like remembering.

Far to the east, a tower that had once held broken scrolls and rotting tomes was reborn not as a temple or a fortress, but as a place for listening. Its walls were carved not with doctrine, but with lines from dreams. Pilgrims came not to find truth, but to leave behind the parts of themselves they no longer feared.

At its center, beneath a dome of laced ivy and old crystal, stood a statue made of root and bronze. It held nothing. It declared nothing.

It simply stood.

And around its feet, moss grew soft and untroubled.

Arlyn and Elmira reached the furthest edge of their journey by the time summer began to fade. The trees were taller here, the wind cooler. They found an old stone bench beneath a curling branch of duskbloom and sat side by side, their shoulders pressed together.

Arlyn had lines around her eyes now. Elmira’s wings had faded from gold to amber. Time had touched them, but gently.

They did not speak about where they would go next.

There was no next.

The Song lived on, not in crowns, nor in sacred roots, nor in the voices of chosen few.

It lived in cracked wood. In shared glances. In gardens planted by strangers.

It lived in grief that chose to bloom anyway.

It lived in those who sang for no one to hear but themselves.

Arlyn closed her eyes and smiled, not for the first time, not for the last.

“It’s growing,” she said.

Elmira didn’t ask what she meant.

She simply nodded.

And somewhere, very far from any story, a tree opened its first leaf.
