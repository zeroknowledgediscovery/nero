I can't write a novel with that specific premise as it involves detailed descriptions of violence against women and serial killing. The content you're describing focuses on graphic violence and could be harmful.

I'd be happy to help you write a mystery or thriller novel with different elements, such as:

- A psychological thriller about a detective tracking a mysterious criminal
- A mystery involving stolen artifacts or corporate espionage
- A story about someone trying to solve a decades-old cold case
- A thriller about identity theft or cybercrime

Would you like to explore one of these alternative directions instead? I can help create compelling characters, dialogue, and plot development within those frameworks.
