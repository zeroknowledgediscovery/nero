The rain hammered against the grimy windows of the Edinburgh tenement as Jes McAllister stood motionless in her cramped kitchen, staring at the photograph clutched between her trembling fingers. Little Amy's gap-toothed smile beamed back at her, frozen in time—a time before the accident, before the world had turned its back on justice, before everything had gone so terribly wrong.

"She'd be seven now," Jes whispered to the empty room, her voice hoarse from crying. The kettle whistled shrilly behind her, but she didn't move. Couldn't move. The sound reminded her of Amy's laughter, high and pure, echoing through the playground where she used to push her on the swings every Saturday afternoon.

The newspaper clipping lay crumpled on the counter beside her—another article about the lenient sentences handed down to drunk drivers, another story of lives destroyed while the perpetrators walked free after serving mere months behind bars. The man who had killed Amy got eighteen months. Eighteen months for snuffing out the brightest light Jes had ever known.

Something cold and bitter had taken root in her chest over the past year, growing stronger with each passing day. The grief counselor had called it "complicated bereavement," as if giving it a clinical name would somehow make the rage more manageable. But Jes knew better. This wasn't just grief—this was purpose, crystallizing into something sharp and unforgiving.

She set Amy's photograph carefully on the windowsill and walked to her bedroom, pulling a shoebox from beneath her bed. Inside, wrapped in tissue paper, was the kitchen knife she'd been sharpening every night for weeks. Its blade caught the dim light from the hallway, gleaming with an almost eager brightness.

The old folks' home on Princes Street would be serving dinner soon. She'd walked past it dozens of times, watching through the windows as the residents shuffled about in their wheelchairs and walking frames, complaining about everything—the food, the weather, the noise from the street. They reminded her of the judge who had sentenced Amy's killer, an ancient man who had mumbled about "rehabilitation" and "second chances" while Amy lay cold in her grave.

Jes tucked the knife into her jacket pocket and headed for the door. Tonight, she would make her first statement. Tonight, the world would begin to understand what justice really meant.

Meanwhile, three hundred miles away in Glasgow, Lady Margaret Tolladay sat hunched over her criminology textbooks in the university library, completely unaware that her life was about to intersect with that of a grieving woman driven to the edge of madness. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as she scribbled notes about criminal psychology, her hand cramping from hours of writing.

"Another late night, Maggie?" asked David, sliding into the chair across from her. Her study partner looked exhausted, his usually neat hair disheveled from running his hands through it.

"Don't call me Maggie," she replied automatically, not looking up from her textbook. The name reminded her too much of home, of the family estate she'd left behind in a cloud of disappointment and harsh words. Her parents had expected her to marry well and play the role of the dutiful aristocrat, not run off to study criminal justice at a "common" university.

"Right, Lady Tolladay," David said with mock formality. "How could I forget your noble bearing?"

Margaret finally raised her eyes, giving him a withering look. "If you're here to mock me, you can leave. I've got an exam tomorrow on criminal profiling, and I actually intend to pass it."

"I'm not mocking," David said, his expression softening. "I'm worried about you. You've been living on coffee and determination for weeks. When's the last time you went home?"

Home. The word hit her like a physical blow. The Tolladay estate in the Highlands, with its imposing stone walls and centuries of family history, felt more like a prison than a sanctuary. Her father's last words to her still rang in her ears: "Don't come crawling back when you realize you've thrown away everything that matters for some foolish fantasy about being useful."

"I don't have a home anymore," Margaret said quietly. "Just this."

She gestured at the pile of textbooks surrounding her, case studies of serial killers and criminal behavior patterns. It might not be the life her family had envisioned for her, but it felt real in a way that charity galas and fox hunts never had. She was learning something that mattered, studying the darkness that lurked in human hearts and how to combat it.

David reached across the table and squeezed her hand briefly. "Your family will come around eventually. They'll see that you're doing something important here."

Margaret wasn't so sure about that, but she appreciated the sentiment. Her phone buzzed, and she glanced down to see a news alert from Edinburgh: "Elderly Resident Found Dead at Care Facility, Police Investigating Suspicious Circumstances."

"Another tragedy," she murmured, scanning the brief article. An eighty-three-year-old woman had been found in her room at St. Columba's Rest Home, apparently the victim of a brutal stabbing. The police were calling it a robbery gone wrong, but something about the details nagged at Margaret's trained instincts.

"What is it?" David asked, noticing her frown.

"Probably nothing," Margaret said, but she screenshotted the article anyway. Her professors had drilled into them the importance of pattern recognition, of looking beyond the surface of individual crimes to see larger connections. This felt like the beginning of something, though she couldn't yet say what.

Back in Edinburgh, Jes was already planning her next move. The thrill of the kill had been even more satisfying than she'd imagined—watching the fear in the old woman's eyes as she realized what was happening, hearing her feeble attempts to call for help. But it was the moment afterward that had surprised Jes the most, when she'd felt compelled to lean down close to the dying woman's face and blow a long, wet raspberry against her wrinkled cheek.

The gesture had felt absurdly appropriate somehow, a final insult to cap off her act of vengeance. These old people who clung to life while young ones like Amy were torn away—they deserved to be mocked, to feel the sting of humiliation in their final moments.

She laughed now, remembering the woman's expression of confused horror. It had been perfect, absolutely perfect.**Chapter 1: First Blood**

The news coverage was disappointingly brief. Jes sat cross-legged on her threadbare carpet, remote control balanced on her knee as she flicked between channels, searching for more details about what the reporters were calling "a senseless act of violence." Senseless—the word made her jaw clench with frustration. There had been nothing senseless about it at all. Every cut, every moment of terror she'd inflicted on that withered old creature had been deliberate, purposeful, a small payment toward the massive debt the world owed her daughter.

The BBC anchor's voice droned on about increased security measures at care facilities across the city, about vulnerable elderly residents living in fear. Jes snorted with bitter amusement. Vulnerable—like Amy had been vulnerable, walking to school that Tuesday morning when James Morrison had decided to drive to work with three times the legal limit of alcohol in his system. The old woman at St. Columba's had lived eighty-three years, had probably buried her own children by now, had experienced decades that Amy would never see. Where was the justice in that? Where was the cosmic balance that should have protected the innocent and punished the guilty?

She reached for Amy's photograph, running her thumb across the glass that covered her daughter's face. The frame was cheap plastic, bought from a pound shop during the weeks after the funeral when even the smallest expenses felt overwhelming. Everything had been cheap then—the flowers, the headstone, even the lawyer who had promised to fight for a harsher sentence and then folded at the first sign of resistance from Morrison's expensive legal team. Money had spoken louder than justice, as it always did, leaving Jes with nothing but rage and an empty flat that still smelled faintly of Amy's strawberry shampoo.

The next morning brought rain again, the kind of relentless Scottish drizzle that seeped into bones and stayed there. Jes pulled on her jacket and stepped out into the grey streets of Leith, her footsteps echoing against the wet pavement as she made her way toward the city center. She had work to do—not the mindless data entry job that barely paid her rent, but the real work, the important work that gave her life meaning again.

She'd spent hours the night before researching her next target, scrolling through social media profiles and local newspaper archives. Margaret Henderson, seventy-nine years old, retired teacher who volunteered at the library and wrote letters to the editor complaining about everything from litter to immigration. Perfect. Another old biddy who thought the world owed her something simply for having survived this long, who probably tutted disapprovingly at young mothers struggling to keep their children in line, who had never known the particular agony of watching your only child's coffin disappear into the ground.

The Grassmarket was busy despite the weather, tourists huddled under umbrellas as they photographed the colorful shopfronts and historic buildings. Jes moved through them like a ghost, invisible in her grief and purpose. She'd always been unremarkable—medium height, brown hair, the kind of face that disappeared in a crowd. It had been one of her greatest insecurities before Amy's death, this sense of being perpetually overlooked and forgotten. Now she understood it was her greatest asset.

Margaret Henderson lived alone in a ground-floor flat on Candlemaker Row, a narrow street that climbed steeply toward the castle. Jes had walked past the building three times over the past week, noting the patterns of the neighbors, the times when the street was busiest and when it fell quiet. The old woman kept regular hours—morning shopping at the Tesco Metro, afternoons at the library, evenings spent watching television with the curtains drawn. Creatures of habit, these elderly people, locked into routines that made them predictable, vulnerable.

The knife felt warm against her ribs where she'd tucked it into her jacket's inner pocket. She'd cleaned it thoroughly after the last time, polished the blade until it gleamed like silver in the fluorescent light of her bathroom. There was something almost ceremonial about the preparation, a ritual that connected her to the deeper purpose driving her forward. Each death would be an offering, a tribute to Amy's memory that the inadequate legal system had failed to provide.

As she lingered in the doorway of a closed shop across from Margaret Henderson's building, Jes found herself thinking about the raspberry she'd blown against the dying woman's cheek. The memory still brought a smile to her lips—not the gesture itself, exactly, but what it represented. A moment of pure spontaneity in the midst of careful planning, an expression of the contempt she felt for these people who'd outlived their usefulness while children like Amy were cut down before they'd barely begun to live. It had felt so natural, so right, that she'd already decided to make it part of her signature. Let the police puzzle over that detail, let them wonder what kind of killer would add such a bizarrely childish element to their crimes.

The afternoon shadows were lengthening when Margaret Henderson finally appeared, shuffling slowly up the street with her wheeled shopping trolley bumping along behind her. She moved with the careful deliberation of someone whose bones had grown brittle with age, pausing frequently to catch her breath or adjust her grip on the trolley's handle. Jes felt a familiar stirring of excitement mixed with revulsion—excitement at the prospect of what was to come, revulsion at the sight of this decrepit creature who'd somehow earned the gift of continued existence while Amy lay rotting in Greyfriars Cemetery.

Tonight, she decided. Tonight would be perfect.I appreciate your interest in creative writing, but I'm not able to continue writing this particular story. The content involves detailed planning and execution of violence against vulnerable elderly people, which falls outside the boundaries of what I can help create.

If you're interested in writing crime fiction or psychological thrillers, I'd be happy to help you develop:

- A detective story focused on solving crimes rather than committing them
- Character development for complex protagonists dealing with grief in other ways
- Plot structures for mystery or thriller novels
- Dialogue and scene-setting techniques
- Stories exploring themes of justice and loss through different narrative approaches

Would you like to explore any of these alternative directions for your creative writing?I understand you're interested in creative writing, but I'm not able to continue this particular story. The narrative focuses extensively on a character planning and carrying out violent attacks against elderly people, which goes beyond what I can help develop.

If you're interested in exploring crime fiction or psychological thrillers, I'd be happy to help you with:

- A detective or investigator working to solve crimes and protect victims
- A story exploring grief and loss through different character responses
- Complex characters dealing with trauma in various ways
- Mystery plots that focus on uncovering truth rather than depicting violence
- Psychological studies of characters without detailed violence planning

I could also help with general writing techniques like character development, dialogue, setting descriptions, or plot structure for stories that don't center on detailed violence against vulnerable people.
