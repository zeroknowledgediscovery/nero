The problem, Alistair would later reflect in the silent, moss-draped solitude of his latter years, began not with a bang, but with a quack. A series of them, in fact. A whole cacophony of insistent, accusatory quacks that had unstitched the very fabric of his princely composure. Before that day, Prince Alistair of the minor, perpetually damp kingdom of Cannock was a creature of straight lines and clear horizons. His fencing was precise, his horsemanship impeccable, his future mapped with the unyielding certainty of a royal cartographer. He was the golden-haired heir, the pride of his granite-jawed father, King Theron. His life was a procession of manageable duties: christening the occasional merchant vessel, inspecting the local militia with a practiced eye, and smiling a carefully calibrated smile at the daughters of neighbouring land barons. Cannock, nestled against the sprawling, heather-choked heath of the Chase, was not a place of high drama. Its monarchy was as old and as worn as the stunted, wind-gnawed oaks that dotted the landscape, a functional relic that the people tolerated with a kind of affectionate grumbling.

Alistair’s world, until his nineteenth summer, was built on the solid bedrock of predictability. His father, the King, viewed emotion as a form of internal treason, a sentiment best locked away in the dungeons of the soul. His stepmother, Queen Isolde, was a creature of cool surfaces and strategic alliances, her affection reserved for her own daughter, Elara, and even that was a measured, calculating thing. Alistair moved through this world with an easy, unexamined grace. He was handsome, capable, and entirely unaware of the fragile architecture of his own mind. He knew, intellectually, what fear was. It was the thrill of a horse taking a fence too fast, the abstract dread of war, a story told by firelight. It was not, he would have sworn on his family’s signet ring, the sight of a small, feathered waterfowl.

The day it happened was cloyingly perfect, a smear of buttery afternoon sun laid thick across the royal lawns. It was a planned picnic, a public display of familial harmony for a visiting dignitary from a less-soggy duchy. Queen Isolde had orchestrated the event with her usual meticulous flair. Blankets the colour of clotted cream, wicker baskets spilling over with cheese and cured meats, and a small, picturesque pond at the edge of the manicured grounds. This was the stage. The pond, with its decorative lily pads and glassy surface, was meant to be a charming backdrop. It was also, unfortunately, home to a flock of mallards who had grown fat and audacious on the scraps of royal indulgence.

Alistair was performing his role admirably. He laughed at the dignitary’s ponderous jokes, he complimented the Queen on the quality of the vintage, and he made polite, meaningless conversation. He was tossing a piece of crust from his sandwich towards the water’s edge when the first one emerged. It was a large drake, its emerald head glittering like a malevolent jewel in the sun. It was soon followed by its brethren. A waddling, web-footed armada, they advanced not with the timid hope of birds, but with the territorial aggression of a besieging army.

At first, it was amusing. A minor diversion. But they kept coming. Out from the reeds, from behind a decorative cattail, until two dozen of them had formed a semi-circle around Alistair's blanket. The quacking began in earnest, a low, demanding chorus that quickly escalated. The sound, somehow, got under his skin. It wasn't just noise; it was a texture, rough and grating, scraping at his nerves. One duck, bolder than the rest, hopped onto the corner of the blanket. Then another. They moved with a jerky, unnatural gait, their beady black eyes fixed on him, unblinking. The dignitary laughed. "They seem to have taken a liking to you, Your Highness!"

Alistair tried to smile, to wave them away. He felt a sudden, inexplicable tightness in his chest. The air, thick with the scent of cut grass and river water, suddenly seemed thin, unbreathable. The flapping started. A disagreement over a fallen crumb of cake erupted into a flurry of wings and feathers. The sound was a rapid, percussive thumping, a sound of muffled drums beating out a rhythm of panic inside his skull. One of them, in its chaotic flutter, struck his cheek with a wing. It wasn't hard, barely a touch, but the oily texture of the feather, the sudden, dry impact, sent a jolt of pure, irrational terror through him. He scrambled backwards, his hand landing in a soft mess of pâté. The ducks, sensing weakness, surged forward. They were a tide of green heads and brown bodies, a single, multi-limbed entity of pure, avaricious want. The quacking was no longer a request, it was a threat, a wall of sound that vibrated in his teeth. He saw a beak, a flash of yellow-orange, peck at the gold of his signet ring. The small, sharp tap was like a key turning a lock deep within him, opening a door to a room he never knew existed, a room filled with a gibbering, formless dread. He was submerged. The flapping, a vortex of air and feathers. The sound, a physical pressure on his eardrums. The sight, a blur of grasping beaks and indifferent, obsidian eyes. He screamed. It was not a princely shout of command. It was a raw, high-pitched shriek of primal fear.

The aftermath was a tableau of mortification. Grooms and guards had rushed in, shooing the birds away with an ease that only amplified Alistair's humiliation. The dignitary was staring, his mouth a perfect ‘o’ of astonishment. Queen Isolde’s face was a mask of fury, her cheeks flushed with the shame of it all. But it was his father’s face that burned itself into Alistair's memory. King Theron stood, his face the colour of old slate, his eyes filled not with concern, but with a contempt so profound it was almost a physical blow. Alistair, his trousers smeared with pâté and his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird, could only stare back. The world had tilted on its axis, and the new angle was one of perpetual, low-grade humiliation.

In the days that followed, the word ‘duck’ became the most obscene in the language. The incident was never spoken of directly in his presence, but it hung in the air of Chase House, thick and suffocating as fog. It was in the sudden silence when he entered a room, the quickly hidden smirks of the stable hands, the way the court tailor now seemed to measure him for a suit of armour made of embarrassment. His father’s disapproval was a constant, oppressive weight. "Ducks?" the King had finally thundered, in the privacy of his study. "You are telling me the Crown Prince of Cannock, a future king, a commander of men, was routed by... ducks?" He said the word as if it were a piece of rotten meat in his mouth. There was no understanding, no offer of help. It was a failing. A weakness. A stain. Alistair was to "get a grip," to "act his station," to simply stop this nonsense.

But he couldn't. The fear, now planted, began to grow, its roots twining around his thoughts. He started avoiding the section of the castle that overlooked the pond. He found himself scrutinising tapestries, his breath catching at any woven depiction of waterfowl. An illustration of a goose in a book of fables was enough to make his palms sweat. The sound of flapping wings—a pigeon taking flight from a windowsill, a servant shaking out a dusty rug—sent a spike of adrenaline through his system. The fear was absurd, he knew it was. That was the most galling part. It was a joke, a ridiculous, unmanly, inexplicable joke, and he was the punchline. His entire, predictable world had been reduced to this one, shameful secret. He began to spend more time in his chambers, feigning illness, claiming he was engrossed in strategy manuals. In reality, he was a prisoner, his own mind the jailer.

Only one person seemed to look at him without a filter of judgment or mockery. His step-sister, Elara. She was two years his junior, a quiet, watchful girl who existed in the margins of court life. Where Alistair had been golden, Elara was muted, a creature of shadows and libraries. She had her mother's sharp intelligence but none of her ambition. While Isolde navigated the court like a shark in shallow waters, Elara drifted through it like a jellyfish, translucent and easily overlooked. She hadn't been at the picnic, having declared the entire affair a "pageant of tedious diplomacy," a phrase that had earned her a week of her mother's icy disapproval.

She found him a week after the incident, hiding in the dusty upper gallery, a long-abandoned hall lined with portraits of grim-faced ancestors. He was staring out a grimy window, looking down at the innocuous, shimmering pond. She didn't say anything at first, simply coming to stand beside him. Her presence was a small, quiet space in the cacophony of the court.

"They're just birds," she said finally, her voice soft.

Alistair flinched. "I know what they are."

"No, you don't," she countered, still not looking at him. "Not anymore. To you, they're something else now. Something you've made them into."

He turned to look at her, expecting the same faint amusement he saw in everyone else's eyes. But there was none. There was only a clear, unnerving perception. "What would you know about it?" he asked, his voice sharper than he intended.

Elara finally turned her gaze on him. Her eyes were a pale, watery grey, but they saw far more than most. "I know what it is to be afraid of something that everyone else thinks is normal," she said. "The way they all talk at the banquets. The sound of all those voices, all at once. Sometimes I feel like I'm going to drown in it." She shrugged, a small, bird-like motion of her shoulders. "My fear is of noise. Yours is of feathers. It's all the same, really. Just a part of your own head that's started shouting at you."

For the first time in a week, Alistair didn't feel entirely alone. He didn't feel understood, not completely, but he felt seen. It was a start. A tiny, flickering candle in the vast, echoing darkness of his new reality. He was still the Prince who was afraid of ducks. He was still a disappointment to his father and a joke to the court. But now, there was one person in the kingdom who didn't think his fear was funny. And for a man whose world had shrunk to the size of his own terror, that small mercy felt as large as the sky. The straight lines of his future had been shattered into a thousand confusing pieces, but in the ruins, he had found an unlikely, and perhaps, an unwilling, ally. The path to the hermitage was a long and winding one, but its first, stumbling steps were taken there, in the dusty silence of the portrait gallery, beside the one person who saw a frightened man instead of a foolish prince.That silence in the gallery stretched, filled only by the whisper of dust motes dancing in the slanted light from the high window. Alistair looked away from her, his jaw tight. To be offered a hand when you believed you were drowning was one thing; to accept it was another entirely. It felt like an admission, a formal surrender to the weakness his father so despised. He, who had always been the giver of comfort, the steady hand on a nervous squire’s shoulder, did not know how to be the one in need. He had no vocabulary for this language of shared fragility.

"Drowning in noise," he repeated, his own voice sounding foreign and rough in the quiet hall. "That sounds... unpleasant." It was a hopelessly inadequate response, the kind of polite, distant comment he might make to a courtier complaining of a mild headache. But it was all he had. Elara did not seem to take offence. She merely gave another of her small, understated shrugs.

"It is," she said simply. "But one learns to find the quiet rooms." She glanced around the gallery, at the stern, forgotten faces of their lineage. "Or the forgotten ones." With that, she turned and slipped away as silently as she had appeared, leaving Alistair alone with the dead and the disquieting echo of her words. He was not alone in his fear, merely alone in the specifics of it. It was a miserable sort of comfort, but it was comfort nonetheless. The shouting in his head did not cease, but for a moment, he could hear a faint, answering echo from a distant room.

In the week that followed, their unspoken alliance took on a strange, furtive shape. There were no more deep conversations, no further confessions. Instead, it was a conspiracy of small gestures. A book left on a bench in the gardens—a collection of ancient poetry with a marker in a verse about a storm-tossed sailor finding a calm harbour. A cup of chamomile tea, left by a page outside his door late at night, with a message that it was from the kitchens, though he knew the scent of the particular blend Elara favoured from her mother's private stock. These were not solutions, but they were acknowledgements. Each one was a quiet, steadying hand on his arm, a whisper in the gloom that he was not, in fact, going mad. He began to look for her in the crowded dining hall, a small anchor of quiet in a sea of noise he was now beginning to notice himself. He saw the way she held herself perfectly still during the boisterous after-dinner conversations, her focus fixed on a single point on the tablecloth, and he recognized the rigid control of someone holding their breath underwater.

This fragile peace, however, was a luxury King Theron had no intention of affording him. The King was a man who solved problems by breaking them over his knee, and his son’s continuing, mortifying malady was a problem that had been allowed to fester long enough. Alistair was summoned to the King's private armoury, a cold, severe room that smelled of whetstone and oil. Trophies of the hunt—the heads of great stags and formidable boars—stared down from the stone walls, their glass eyes seeming to hold the same flat disappointment as the King’s. King Theron stood by a rack of swords, running a gauntleted thumb along the edge of a perfectly balanced blade. He did not look at Alistair as he entered.

"Your seclusion is at an end," the King stated, the words clanging with finality. "Tomorrow, at dawn, you and I will be going hunting."

Alistair's heart gave a sickening lurch. Hunting he could manage. It was horsemanship and archery, skills he possessed in abundance. "Of course, Father. What is the quarry?" he asked, trying to keep his voice level.

The King finally turned, and his eyes, cold as the northern sea, fixed on Alistair. He placed the sword back on its rack with a sharp, definitive click that made Alistair flinch. There was a cruel, thin smile on his father's lips, the smile of a man about to administer a painful but, in his mind, necessary lesson.

"We will be hunting on the wetlands at the edge of the Chase," he said, his voice dropping low with theatrical weight. "The marshes are teeming this time of year. A perfect opportunity for you to reacquaint yourself with the concept of mastery over the natural world." He paused, letting the silence hang between them like an executioner's axe. "We are hunting duck."The word hung in the cold air of the armoury, small and obscene. Duck. It was not a command, but a sentence. Alistair felt the blood drain from his face, a cold retreat that left his skin feeling tight and foreign. He stared at his father, at the hard line of his mouth and the utter absence of sympathy in his eyes, and understood that this was not an invitation. It was a trial by ordeal, and the verdict had already been decided. He had no words of protest, no argument he could possibly make that would not sound like the whimper of a coward. His throat was a knot of unshed arguments and pure, distilled terror. All he could manage was a single, jerky nod, the motion of a puppet whose strings had just been pulled taut.

He walked from the armoury in a daze, the familiar corridors of Chase House suddenly feeling alien and threatening. The woven heroes in the tapestries seemed to turn their stitched eyes to follow him, their expressions of painted valour a silent mockery of his own failing. Every shadow seemed to hold the bent-neck shape of a waterfowl, every gust of wind through an open window sounded like the preamble to a flapping of wings. He could feel the oily texture of the feather on his cheek again, a phantom sensation that made him want to scrub at his own skin. He had to find Elara. The thought was not a conscious plan but an instinct, the desperate urge of a wounded animal seeking the one safe place in the woods.

He found her not in the library, but in the small, cloistered herb garden behind the kitchens, a place she favoured for its quiet and its earthy, ordered scents of lavender and thyme. She was crouched down, examining the delicate fronds of a fern, her dark hair falling forward to obscure her face. He stood at the stone entrance for a long moment, the scent of damp earth and crushed mint filling his lungs, his courage failing him. How could he voice this new, specific horror? How could he give it substance by speaking it aloud? He finally took a step onto the path, the crunch of gravel loud in the stillness. She looked up, unsurprised, as if she had been expecting him. He didn't need to explain his distress; it was written all over him. "He is taking me hunting," Alistair said, the words coming out in a raw whisper. He had to force the last part out. "For ducks."

Elara rose slowly to her feet, wiping dirt from her hands onto her simple woollen dress. She looked at him, and for a moment her pale face was as hard and unforgiving as her mother's, but the anger was not directed at him. It was a cold, sharp fury aimed squarely at the King. "Of course he is," she said, her voice low and biting. "He thinks fear is a nail that can be hammered flat. He thinks you are a piece of warped timber that can be forced straight." She stepped closer, her unnerving gaze fixed on his. She understood the purpose of this hunt perfectly; it was not a cure, it was a punishment. An exercise in humiliation designed to break what was already broken. "He is a fool. He sees a crack and instead of mending it, he strikes it with a hammer to prove the material is weak." She reached into a fold of her dress and her hand emerged in a fist. She pressed something small, cool, and smooth into his palm. "Take this."

Alistair looked down. It was a river stone, worn perfectly smooth and ovular by years in a current, a deep, solid black veined with a thin line of white quartz. It was heavy in his hand, a small, solid piece of the world. "What is it for?" he asked, his voice thick. "It is a stone," Elara said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "It has weight. It is real. It does not have feathers. It does not make a sound. When your head starts shouting, hold it. Remember that this is real, and the rest is just the shouting." She closed his fingers over it with her own. "He cannot take this from you."

That night, Alistair did not sleep. He lay in his vast, cold bed, the silken sheets feeling like a shroud, and clutched the river stone in his hand. Its cool, dense reality was a tiny anchor in a swirling sea of dread. Every creak of the castle's old timbers, every hoot of a distant owl, was twisted by his mind into the precursor of a quack. He saw them in the darkness behind his eyelids: a waddling, inexorable army of them, their heads gleaming like wet jewels, their beady eyes fixed on him. He would grip the stone until his knuckles were white, focusing on its unyielding smoothness, whispering Elara's words to himself. *It is just a stone. It is just the shouting.* It did little to quell the terror, but it kept him from being completely submerged by it. It was the difference between drowning and treading water in a freezing, endless ocean.

Dawn arrived not as a promise of light but as a sentence read at sunrise. It was a typical Cannock morning, the sky a uniform shade of bruised grey, a fine mist clinging to everything and blurring the edges of the world. In the courtyard, the grooms and stable hands moved with a forced, unnatural quiet, their eyes refusing to meet his. His father was already mounted, a rigid silhouette of leather and grim purpose, his prize hunting hawk hooded and still on his gauntlet. The King’s horse was a massive black destrier, impatient and powerful; Alistair's own palfrey felt like a child's pony by comparison. They rode out of the castle gates without a word, the only sounds the rhythmic clop of hooves on wet stone and the jingle of harness. The silence stretched between them, heavier and more suffocating than any fog, freighted with all the things Alistair could not say and all the things the King would not hear.

The wetlands lay in a low, sprawling basin at the foot of the heath, a place of stagnant pools and vast reed beds that whispered and swayed in the damp breeze. The air smelled of decay and wet soil, of the thick, primal soup of life and death. To his father, this was a sportsman's paradise. To Alistair, it was the gaping maw of his own private hell. They dismounted, tethering their horses to a skeletal willow tree, and took their positions in a crude blind made of woven branches that offered a view of a wide, dark pond. The water was like polished slate, reflecting the colourless sky. The silence here was different from the castle's; it was a living thing, punctuated by the chirp of unseen insects and the sudden, startling splash of a fish. It was the silence of anticipation.

King Theron moved with the quiet, deadly economy of a predator. He unstrung the short, powerful bow from his saddle and passed it to Alistair, along with a quiver of grey-feathered arrows. "You will take the first shot," he commanded, his voice a low rasp. "Do not shame me." Then, he lifted a carved wooden call to his lips and blew. The sound that came out was a perfect, rolling imitation of a mallard's call, a sound of invitation and contentment. It was a lie. And from across the pond, an answer came back. A real one. A cheerful, innocuous series of quacks that sent a tremor of ice through Alistair's veins. He saw a ripple in the reeds, then a flash of iridescent green. A drake emerged, followed by two, then three more, gliding onto the open water with effortless grace, drawn towards the King’s deceitful call.

His heart hammered a frantic, sickening rhythm against his ribs. The world narrowed to the sight of those birds, so peaceful and so utterly terrifying. Their emerald heads glittered. Their small, dark eyes seemed to scan the shoreline, searching. The sound started again, a conversational chorus now, the same grating, demanding texture that had unstitched him on the lawn. It scraped along his nerves, awakening the beast of his fear. He felt the phantom flapping around his head, smelled the river-scent of their feathers. His palms were slick with sweat on the smooth yew of the bow. "Now," his father hissed beside him, a hot, impatient breath against his ear. "Draw, you fool. They will not wait forever."

With trembling arms, Alistair raised the bow. He tried to nock an arrow, his fingers clumsy and disobedient. He looked down the length of the shaft, trying to fix the point on the chest of the nearest drake. But the bird was not a target. It was a collection of his terrors: the sharp yellow beak, the unblinking black eye, the memory of the chaotic flutter of wings. The air grew thick and heavy in his lungs, and a black fuzz crept in at the edges of his vision. The quacking was a wall of sound, vibrating in his teeth, in his very bones. The bow felt impossibly heavy, an instrument of a courage he no longer possessed. He could hear his own breathing, a ragged, panicked gasping. He lowered the bow. The words were a choked whisper, an admission of utter defeat. "I cannot."

The silence that followed was more violent than any shout. The King did not move for a long second, and in that moment, Alistair felt a flicker of hope that he might see something—a son, a frightened man, anything but a failure. The hope was extinguished as quickly as it came. With a snarl of pure contempt, the King snatched the bow from Alistair's limp grasp. In one fluid, beautiful, and terrible motion, he nocked, drew, and released. The arrow was a grey streak, almost invisible against the grey water. It struck the lead drake with a soft, meaty thud. The bird convulsed, its wings beating the water in a final, frantic spasm, and then it was still, a patch of vibrant colour slowly fading as it lay upon the dark surface. King Theron lowered the bow, his face a mask of cold fury. He turned his gaze on Alistair, and the disappointment in his eyes was a chasm, deep and absolute. "You are a stranger to me," he said, his voice flat and dead, each word a stone dropped into a well. "I do not know who you are." He turned his back on his son and strode towards the horses, leaving Alistair alone in the blind, surrounded by the whispering reeds and the echoing silence of his own disgrace.Alistair did not move. He remained in the damp, crumbling blind, a statue of disgrace. The world had gone utterly silent, save for the gentle lapping of water against the reeds and the whisper of the wind, which now sounded like a long, mournful sigh. On the dark surface of the pond, the dead drake floated, a small, vibrant tragedy. The iridescent green of its head, which moments before had been a source of pure terror, was now just a patch of colour, beautiful and inert. The life had gone out of it, and Alistair felt as though the life had gone out of him, too. His father's words echoed in the hollow space where his princely composure used to be. *You are a stranger to me. I do not know who you are.* He felt the truth of them in his bones. He did not know who this trembling, useless creature was either. He was a ghost haunting the armour of a prince, and the cold metal of it was all that held his dissolving form together.

The ride back to Chase House was an exercise in negation. King Theron rode several lengths ahead, a rigid, unapproachable figure whose back communicated more contempt than a thousand shouted insults. He did not look back once. Alistair followed, his palfrey seeming to sense its rider's despair, its gait hesitant and slow. The fine mist thickened into a miserable drizzle that soaked through Alistair's fine woolen cloak, chilling him to the marrow. He did not notice. He was already frozen from the inside out. He felt disembodied, as if he were watching himself from a great distance—a pathetic figure on a pale horse, trailing his king like a stain. The familiar landscape of Cannock, the stunted oaks and heather-choked hills, looked alien and hostile, a kingdom he no longer belonged to. By the time the grim silhouette of the castle rose from the fog, he felt he was not returning home, but to the scene of a crime in which he was both victim and perpetrator.

The courtyard was a theatre of silent judgment. Grooms and guards, who had once greeted him with bluff, easy respect, now found urgent tasks to attend to the moment he appeared. Their eyes slid away from his, their shoulders hunched with a shared, unspoken embarrassment on his behalf. The shame was a physical presence in the air, as thick as the morning's fog. He dismounted, his limbs stiff and unresponsive, and handed the reins to a stable boy who could not meet his gaze. He walked through the castle's great doors, past retainers who fell silent and bowed their heads, their deference now feeling like a form of pity. He heard a door close sharply down a corridor and knew it was his stepmother, Isolde, making her disapproval known without a word. The entire world, it seemed, had learned to speak his father’s language of silent contempt. His one thought was to escape, to find a room without eyes, without judgment, without the suffocating weight of what he had become.

He found Elara in the scriptorium, a place of ink and vellum and concentrated quiet. The air smelled of old paper and beeswax. She was not copying manuscripts but mending one, her slender fingers working with delicate precision to reattach a loose page with a thread and needle. She looked up as he entered, her pale grey eyes taking in his rain-soaked clothes, his hollowed-out expression, his utter defeat. She showed no surprise, no shock. She simply set down her needle, her movements calm and deliberate, a small island of stability in his swirling world. He walked towards her table, his legs feeling like lead, and stopped. He did not know what to say. The words he needed had not been invented. He simply reached into his pocket and drew out the river stone she had given him. It was still cold from the morning air. He placed it on the ancient oak of the table between them. It made a soft, solid sound, a sound of profound and simple reality. Elara looked from the stone to his face, and her own softened with a deep, weary understanding that went beyond pity. "I see," she said, her voice barely a whisper. And he knew that she did.

The days that followed were a descent. The court ceased to be a home and became a gallery of his own humiliation. King Theron did not speak to him, did not even look at him. He moved through Alistair's presence as if his son were a draft from an ill-fitting window, a minor annoyance to be ignored. Queen Isolde, for her part, was surgically precise in her cruelty. She would direct questions about the succession to distant cousins in his hearing, or praise the martial prowess of visiting knights while her eyes flickered towards him with cold amusement. The fear, fed by this constant, grinding shame, grew monstrous and complex. It was no longer just about the birds. It was the fear of a door opening suddenly, of a raised voice in the corridor, of the rustle of a lady's silk dress that sounded too much like the whisper of wings. His world, once mapped with clear horizons, had shrunk to the four walls of his bedchamber. He took his meals there, claiming a persistent fever. Sleep offered no escape, populated as it was by smothering feathers and a cacophony of accusatory quacks. He was wasting away, a prisoner in the fortress of his own skull.

Elara watched it all, her quiet presence a constant, unobtrusive vigil. She saw the uneaten food on the trays left outside his door, heard the restless pacing from the room below hers late at night. She saw the way the light had fled his eyes, replaced by a haunted, hunted look. The books and cups of tea were no longer enough; they were pleasantries offered to a dying man. The king's hammer had not flattened the nail; it had shattered the wood. One evening, she came to his room without being summoned. She did not knock, but entered quietly, holding a single lit candle that pushed a small, trembling circle of light into the oppressive gloom. Alistair was sitting by the window, staring out into the blackness, so still she might have mistaken him for a piece of furniture. He did not turn as she approached. "You are dying in here," she said, her voice devoid of accusation. It was a simple statement of fact. "This place, these walls, they are the cage now. Not the fear."

He finally turned to look at her, his face a pale mask in the candlelight. "Where else is there?" he asked, his voice a dry rasp from disuse. "The world is full of... them. And fathers. And kings." His despair was a vast, listless ocean, and he had long since stopped trying to swim. Elara placed the candle on a small table, the flame dancing and throwing their shadows, long and distorted, against the tapestry on the wall. "There are other places," she said, stepping closer. "Not all of Cannock is the court. Not all of life is this." She paused, gathering her thoughts, choosing her words with the same care she used to mend her books. "On the far side of the Chase, carved into the old stone of the high moors, there is a hermitage. It has been there for centuries. It's a place for those who are... untethered. For minds that have come loose from their moorings. The man who lives there now, Brother Thole, they say he doesn't mend souls. They say he teaches people how to listen to their own brokenness." She looked at him, her gaze intense and serious. "It is a long journey. To leave would be to abandon your title, your duty. Your father would see it as the final desertion. The court would call it madness." She let the weight of those consequences settle in the air between them. "But it is a quiet room, Alistair. Perhaps the quietest one there is. And it might be a place where you can learn to stop shouting back."A hermitage. The word landed in the dead air of the room, foreign and archaic. Alistair had only ever heard it in tales of pious saints or disgraced knights seeking penance. It was a place outside of the world, a deliberate erasure of self. He looked from Elara’s earnest face to the oppressive luxury of his chambers—the heavy velvet curtains, the silver ewer on the washstand, the intricately carved posts of his bed. For his entire life, these things had been the grammar of his existence, the tangible proof of his identity. Now they felt like the furnishings of a very beautiful tomb. The thought of leaving it all, of trading his name and station for a stone cell and anonymity, was terrifying. It was an admission of defeat more profound than lowering the bow at the wetlands. But the alternative, to remain here and be slowly crushed into dust by the weight of his father’s contempt and his own shame, was not a life. It was a slow-motion execution.

“They would call it madness,” he repeated her words, his voice a dry whisper. He looked down at his hands, hands that had been trained to hold a sword and a sceptre, that had been praised for their steadiness and grace. Now they trembled with a faint, incessant tremor. “Perhaps it is. But the madness is already here, inside these walls.” He rose from the chair, the movement stiff and uncertain, the motion of an old man. He walked to the window and looked down into the courtyard, now empty and slick with rain. He imagined tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. The averted eyes, the sudden silences, his father’s back turned to him in the great hall. He pictured the long, slow decay of his own mind, the final, inevitable victory of the shouting. He turned back to Elara, his face resolved in the flickering candlelight. It was not the strong, princely resolution of old, but the grim, hollow-eyed resolve of a man with nothing left to lose. “When?”

The question transformed Elara. The quiet, watchful girl receded, and in her place stood a sharp, focused strategist, her mother’s daughter in all but ambition. Her plans, it turned out, were not a sudden desperate suggestion but something she had been quietly assembling in the back of her mind, a contingency for a collapse she had seen coming long before he had. The conspiracy took shape in hushed conversations over the next two nights, in the spaces where the castle slept. She was the architect of his disappearance. She procured a change of clothes—not the rags of a beggar, but the simple, durable tunic and breeches of a travelling scholar, anonymous and unremarkable. She filled a leather satchel with hard cheese, a loaf of dense rye bread, a waterskin, and a small, heavy purse of coins, enough for emergencies but not enough to attract a thief’s eye. The most precious item was a map, copied by her own hand onto a piece of soft doe-skin, showing the forgotten tracks and shepherd’s paths that cut across the Chase, avoiding the main roads and villages.

“You will be gone two days before they are certain you have fled,” she explained, her voice low and steady as she pointed to a route on the map. They were in the library, a single candle burning between them, casting their faces in dramatic light and shadow. “I will tell them you have taken to your bed with the fever again, and that the royal physician has ordered absolute quiet. It will buy you time. But once the King realizes you are truly gone…” Her voice trailed off, the consequences hanging unspoken between them. She would face his wrath alone. Alistair felt a pang of guilt, a ghostly echo of the protective instinct he once had. He was not just saving himself; he was placing her in the line of fire. “Elara, I cannot ask you to do this.” She looked up from the map, her pale eyes clear and unblinking. “You are not asking,” she said simply. “I am offering. What happens in this court is a game of surfaces. I know how to be invisible when I need to be. You do not. You were made to be seen, which is why you must vanish completely.”

The night of his departure was starless and moonless, the sky a blanket of impenetrable black. A thick fog, a true Cannock speciality, had rolled in from the heath, muffling all sound and swallowing the castle’s familiar outlines. It was the perfect accomplice. Dressed in the unfamiliar wool, the satchel heavy on his shoulder, Alistair felt like an imposter in his own home. He moved through the sleeping castle, a ghost slipping through his own life. The portraits in the gallery were dark, rectangular voids, their judgment finally silenced. The great hall was an echoing cavern of shadows. Elara met him at a small postern gate in the castle’s northern wall, a gate used by kitchen staff and gardeners, far from the watchful eyes of the main guard. She carried no light. The fog swirled around them, cold and damp against his face. She pressed something into his hand. It was the smooth, black river stone. "For the shouting," she said softly. He gripped it, its solidity a small, final piece of her quiet strength. There were no grand farewells, no tears. Their bond had been forged in silence and it was in silence that they parted. He looked at her one last time, this strange, sad, fiercely intelligent girl who had become his only anchor. "Thank you," he whispered, the words feeling hopelessly small. She simply nodded, a flicker of a shadow in the deeper dark, and then he pushed open the heavy wooden gate and slipped out into the fog, pulling it shut behind him with a soft, final click.

The world outside the walls was immediate and disorienting. The air was thick with the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves. The fog was so dense he could see no more than a few feet in any direction, the ground beneath his boots uncertain and soft. For a terrifying moment, he was adrift, a man without a kingdom, a name, or a direction. Panic, cold and familiar, began to prickle at the back of his neck. He clutched the stone in his pocket, its sharp edges digging into his palm. He forced himself to breathe, to listen. The silence here was different. It was not the loaded, judgmental silence of the court. It was a vast, empty, and indifferent silence, the ancient quiet of the land itself. It held no opinion of him. It did not care that he was a prince, or a coward. He was simply a man, walking in the dark. Following the first turn on Elara’s memorized map, he left the shadow of the castle walls and set his face towards the dark, looming expanse of the Chase. He did not look back. There was nothing there for him anymore. Ahead lay a wilderness of stone and heather, a journey of unknown length to an unknown future. He was afraid, but it was a new fear, clean and sharp, the fear of the unknown path ahead, not the suffocating, cyclical dread of the prison he had left behind. For the first time in months, he was moving forward.The fog did not lift so much as it dissolved, thinning into a pale, luminous haze that clung to the hollows of the land. Alistair awoke stiff and cold, his back protesting the unyielding earth that had served as his bed. He had found shelter in the lee of a granite tor, a jagged outcrop that broke the monotony of the rolling heath, and had passed a fitful, dream-haunted night. Now, in the thin grey light of his first dawn as a free man, he saw the Chase for what it was. It was not a landscape to be admired from a castle window. It was a vast, raw, and profoundly indifferent wilderness. Heather, tough and wiry, spread in every direction like a purple-brown sea, broken by patches of acidic green bog and the skeletal remains of ancient, wind-tortured trees. The silence was absolute, a pressure on the eardrums. There was no birdsong, no distant bell, no human sound at all. He was utterly, terrifyingly alone.

He ate a piece of the hard cheese and a chunk of Elara’s dense bread, the food tasting of ash in his dry mouth. He consulted the doe-skin map, its lines and symbols a fragile human imposition on the sprawling reality around him. He was a creature of straight lines and clear horizons, but there were no straight lines here. The path Elara had marked was not a path at all, but a suggestion, a faint animal track that threaded its way through the gorse and bracken. He set off, his muscles aching, the satchel a leaden weight on his shoulder. Every step was a conscious effort. His fine leather boots, designed for polished floors and the occasional manicured lawn, were no match for the sucking mud of the bogs or the sharp stones hidden in the heather. Within hours, his feet were blistered and his ankles were raw. The pampered body of the prince was in open rebellion against this new, brutal reality. He had commanded men, but he could not command his own complaining flesh. The absurdity of it, the sheer indignity, was a fresh humiliation.

He walked for what felt like an eternity, the sun a weak, watery disc in the overcast sky. The world was a repeating pattern of brown, purple, and grey. He thought of Elara, wondering if his absence had been discovered, if she was now facing his father’s glacial rage. The guilt was a sharp, physical pain, another burden to carry along with his satchel and his fear. He thought of his father, and the contempt in his eyes felt as real as the ache in his feet. The shouting in his head began to stir, a low murmur at first, testing the new silence. *Coward. Failure. Stranger.* He fumbled in his pocket for the river stone, its cool, smooth weight a familiar comfort. He focused on its solidity, on the feeling of his boots sinking into the soft earth, on the damp wind against his face. He tried to root himself in the physical world, to starve the voices in his head of the attention they craved. It was a constant, exhausting battle, a second journey taking place entirely within the confines of his skull.

The trigger came without warning. He was traversing a long, shallow valley when the ground in front of him erupted. A covey of grouse, hidden perfectly in the heather, burst into the air in a sudden, percussive explosion of wings and panicked calls. The sound—that rapid, thumping flutter—was a key scraped raw in the lock of his terror. The world dissolved. He was back on the lawn, the air thick with feathers, the sun blotted out by a vortex of flapping wings. He cried out, stumbling backward, his arms flailing as if to ward off a physical assault. He fell hard, the impact jarring his teeth, his satchel flying from his shoulder. He scrambled away on his hands and knees, whimpering, his eyes squeezed shut against the phantom sight of grasping beaks and malevolent, glittering heads. The panic was a physical thing, a hot, suffocating tide that filled his lungs and throat, drowning him. There was no groom to rush in, no guard to scatter the foe. There was only him, and the indifferent sky, and the endless, empty land.

He lay there for a long time, curled on his side, his body trembling with the aftershocks of the terror. The grouse were long gone, their calls fading into the distance. The silence returned, but it was a different silence now, one that held the echo of his own raw scream. Slowly, painfully, he uncurled. He was covered in mud and bracken, his hands scraped and bleeding. His breath came in ragged, shuddering gasps. He had been utterly undone by a sound, by a memory. But he was alive. He was still here. He pushed himself into a sitting position, his limbs shaking uncontrollably. He saw his satchel lying a few feet away, its contents spilled across the damp ground. A hunk of cheese, the waterskin, the precious map. He crawled towards it, not as a prince, not as a man, but as a wounded animal. As his hand closed over the cool leather of the waterskin, he felt something else: the smooth, solid weight of the river stone, which had fallen from his pocket. He picked it up, its familiar shape fitting perfectly in his palm. *It is just a stone,* he whispered, the words a hoarse croak. *It is just the shouting.* He had survived. Alone. It was not a victory, but it was not a complete defeat either. It was a beginning.

He found the old shepherd two days later, near a stream that cut a dark line through a swathe of bog-cotton. The man was as ancient and weathered as the land itself, his face a roadmap of wrinkles, his eyes the pale, washed-out blue of the Cannock sky. He sat on a rock, watching a small flock of gaunt, hardy sheep, a crook resting in the crook of his arm. He showed no surprise at Alistair’s approach, merely watching him with a calm, uncurious gaze. Alistair, his voice rough from disuse, asked for the direction to the high moors. He felt a fool as he did it, his courtly accent sounding strange and out of place in this wild emptiness. The shepherd took a long time to answer, his gaze taking in Alistair’s ruined boots, his torn tunic, and the haunted look in his eyes.

"The moors are that way," the shepherd said, gesturing with his chin towards a series of dark, forbidding hills on the horizon. His voice was a low burr, thick with the accent of the deep country. "Long walk for a lad in fancy shoes." He did not ask Alistair's name, or his business. In the Chase, such questions were an intrusion. You were who you were in that moment, nothing more. "You look like you're runnin' from something," the shepherd observed, not as an accusation, but as a simple statement of fact, like remarking on the weather. "Most folk who come this way are. But the thing about the Chase is, it's a big, empty place. Nothin' to hide behind out here. You end up facin' whatever you brought with you, sooner or later." He turned his attention back to his sheep. "Best to keep walkin', then. One foot, then the other. Nothin' else for it."

The shepherd’s words, simple and profound, stayed with Alistair as he refilled his waterskin and continued his journey. *One foot, then the other. Nothin' else for it.* It became his mantra, a charm against the shouting. He stopped thinking about the destination, about the hermitage, about what he would do when he got there. He focused only on the next step, on the rhythm of his own walking. He learned to read the subtle shifts in the landscape, to tell the difference between solid ground and treacherous bog by the colour of the moss. He learned the taste of fresh, cold water from a high spring and the surprising sweetness of the wild berries that grew in sheltered crevices. He grew leaner, harder. The soft flesh of the prince was being burned away, leaving something tougher, more resilient, underneath. His fear did not vanish, but it changed. It became a part of the landscape of his mind, like a dark mountain on the horizon—always there, but no longer blocking out the entire sky.

On the evening of the fifth day, he crested a high ridge and stopped, his breath catching in his throat. In the distance, rising from the darkening plains, was the next stage of his journey: the high moors. They were stark and elemental, great humps of granite and peat that clawed at the sky, their peaks wreathed in the evening mist. They looked like a fortress built by giants, a place of stone and silence at the very edge of the world. Somewhere in that fastness was the hermitage, the quiet room Elara had promised. The journey to its door was still long and would be harder than anything he had yet faced. But as he stood there, a solitary, wind-scoured figure against the vast, twilight sky, he felt not despair, but a flicker of something he had not felt since before the day of the picnic. It was a fragile, unfamiliar feeling, but he recognized it. It was hope. The prince who had fled Chase House was gone, dead and buried somewhere back in the mud and the fog. The man who stood here now, clutching a river stone in his pocket, was someone new. He did not know his name yet, but he knew he was still walking. And for now, that was enough.The hope he felt was a fragile warmth in the vast, gathering cold of the high moors. As he began the ascent the next day, the character of his journey changed utterly. The rolling heath had been a test of endurance, a long, wearying walk. The moors were a battle of verticality. The ground rose up to meet him in steep, unforgiving inclines of shattered rock and slick, moss-covered stone. He was no longer just walking; he was climbing, his hands raw and scraped as he searched for purchase, his pampered muscles screaming in protest at this new, brutal vocabulary of movement. The air grew thin and sharp, and the wind, no longer a sighing presence, became a physical force that sought to tear him from the rock face, a constant, bullying pressure that scoured all warmth from his body.

With every foot of elevation he gained, he felt he was leaving more of the prince behind. The precise, elegant lunges of the fencing yard were a mockery here, where his only form was a desperate, clumsy scramble. The world of courtly protocol, of carefully chosen words and calibrated smiles, seemed like a story from another man’s life. Out here, there was only the stone, the wind, and the relentless pull of the earth below. The shouting in his head had not ceased, but its tenor had changed. It was no longer a chorus of accusation but a single, insistent voice of doubt. *This will break you. The stone does not care. The wind will win.* He found himself talking back to it, not aloud, but in the private theatre of his mind, his arguments as simple and solid as the rock he clung to. *One more step. This handhold is real. The wind is just wind.* He was learning to separate the sensation from the story his fear told about it. The flapping of wings was a sound; the terror was his own creation. The wind was a force of nature; the malice was his own projection.

On the second day of the climb, the sky, which had been a sheet of dull pewter, turned the colour of a fresh bruise. The wind fell away into an eerie, pregnant silence, and the world seemed to hold its breath. Then the storm broke. It was not the familiar, dreary rain of Cannock, but a wild, highland fury. Rain came down not in drops but in solid, wind-driven sheets that blurred the world into a grey chaos and stung his face like flung gravel. The fog descended in an instant, a thick, white blindness that reduced his world to a few feet of treacherous, slick rock. He had lost the faint track he was following, and Elara’s map, a sodden pulp in his satchel, was now useless. The cold, which had been a persistent enemy, became a predator, sinking its teeth deep into his bones. The voice of doubt in his head became a triumphant roar. *Lost. You will die here, a fool on a fool's errand, and no one will ever know your grave.*

He found shelter by instinct, crawling into a narrow fissure between two great slabs of granite, a space barely wide enough for his body. He huddled there, shivering violently, the stone leaching what little warmth he had left. His teeth chattered, a frantic, uncontrollable rhythm. He tried to eat the last of his bread, but his fingers were too numb to grip it properly, and it fell from his grasp into a puddle of icy water. Despair, stark and absolute, settled over him. This was the end. He had escaped the prison of the court only to die in a bigger, colder one. He thought of Elara, her fierce, quiet faith in him a burning ember of guilt. He thought of his father, and for a moment, he imagined the King’s grim satisfaction at this final, pathetic proof of his son’s weakness. He closed his eyes, a strange sense of resignation washing over him. It would be easy to just stop, to let the shivering cease, to surrender to the deep, inviting cold. But then, his numb fingers, fumbling inside his tunic for a scrap of warmth, brushed against the hard, familiar shape of the river stone. He pulled it out, its cold surface a shocking jolt of reality against his skin. *It is just a stone.* He thought of the shepherd. *One foot, then the other. Nothin' else for it.* It was not a grand revelation. It was a small, stubborn refusal. He would not die here. He did not know how he would survive, but he made the choice to do so. He would face the morning.

The storm passed as suddenly as it had arrived, leaving behind a world washed clean and glittering. The air was achingly clear, the sky a high, pale blue. Shivering, half-frozen, but alive, Alistair crawled from his rocky crevice. He was weak, dizzy with hunger, but the despair had been scoured out of him along with his strength. As his eyes adjusted to the bright, cold light, he scanned the horizon, and he saw it. Miles away, nestled on a high, remote ledge on the flank of the largest peak, was a thin, impossibly delicate plume of grey smoke, rising straight into the windless air. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. It was a sign, a promise. A quiet room.

That wisp of smoke became his new compass. The journey towards it took the rest of the day, a slow, painful pilgrimage across the rocky, storm-washed landscape. His hunger was a dull, constant ache, but his mind was clear and focused, fixed on that single point of hope. As he drew closer, he could begin to make out the details of the place. It was not a grand monastery or a proud tower. It was something far more humble, so perfectly integrated into the stone that it seemed to have grown there. A low, curved wall of grey rock that followed the line of the cliff, a roof of thick, living turf, and a single, low doorway that looked like the entrance to a badger's sett. Beside it, clinging precariously to the ledge, was a small, terraced garden, a patch of defiant green in the vastness of the grey stone, enclosed by a low wall to protect it from the wind. It was a place of immense and profound solitude, a testament to a life lived in deliberate quiet.

He approached the ledge with a reverence he had never felt in any cathedral. His footsteps, loud in the immense silence, faltered as he reached the low stone wall of the garden. The door to the dwelling was open. A man was working in the garden, his back to Alistair. He was on his knees, his hands buried in the dark soil, tending to a row of young cabbage plants. He wore a simple, undyed woollen robe, the hood thrown back. He was neither old nor young, his shoulders broad, his movements slow, patient, and deeply absorbed. Alistair stood there, leaning on the wall for support, his journey at its end. He did not know what to say, what to ask for. All the words he had, the courtly phrases and commands of a prince, were useless here. He simply waited, his breath pluming in the cold air, a man stripped of everything but his own exhaustion and his own fear. After a long moment, the man in the garden finished patting the soil around a plant and, without turning, spoke. His voice was calm and even, a quiet sound that was not jarring in the great silence. "You have been walking a long time to stand so still." Then he rose, slowly, and turned. His face was plain, weathered by sun and wind, and his eyes were the colour of the wet stones around them, clear and deep. He looked at Alistair, taking in the torn clothes, the gaunt face, the tremor in his hands, and his expression held no surprise, only a gentle, weary perception. "There is soup on the fire. You should come in before you fall down."Alistair crossed the threshold and the world changed. Outside was the vast, cold, elemental emptiness of the moors; inside was warmth, and the thick, savoury scent of root vegetables and woodsmoke. The hermitage was a single, circular room, a cave made civilised. The walls were the living stone of the mountain, smoothed by centuries of habitation, and the floor was covered with dry, sweet-smelling rushes. A fire burned in a central, stone-lined hearth, the smoke drawn upwards through a cunningly crafted hole in the turf roof. Against one wall was a sleeping alcove filled with furs and woollen blankets, and against another were shelves carved directly from the rock, holding a few simple earthenware pots, a handful of leather-bound books, and bundles of dried herbs that scented the air with notes of thyme and mint. It was a space stripped of all vanity, everything in it functional, worn, and suffused with a sense of profound peace. It was the quietest room Alistair had ever been in.

Brother Thole moved with an unhurried grace, ladling a thick, steaming soup from a black iron pot that hung over the fire into a simple wooden bowl. He handed it to Alistair without a word. Alistair’s hands shook so badly he could barely take it. He slumped onto a low, three-legged stool by the hearth, the warmth of the fire a blessed relief on his frozen face. He held the bowl in both hands, feeling the heat seep into his numb fingers. He lifted it to his lips and drank, the act of a starving animal, not a prince. The soup was simple—barley, leeks, and carrots, he thought—but it was the most exquisite meal he had ever tasted. It was hot and real and substantial. It was life. He drank the entire bowl in a few desperate gulps, the warmth spreading through his chest, a slow-dawning sunrise in the frozen landscape of his body. When he was done, he sat there, clutching the empty bowl, the last of his strength finally deserting him. The noise of his own shivering was loud in the quiet room.

He did not remember dropping the bowl, nor did he remember being guided to the sleeping alcove. The arrival in this place of safety was the signal for which his body had been waiting, the final permission to collapse. Consciousness frayed and dissolved, and he fell into a sleep so deep it was like a death, a bottomless black well without thought or dream. He was dimly aware, at some point, of a heavy fur being draped over him, of the distant, gentle crackle of the fire, but they were sensations from another world. He had journeyed beyond the reach of fear, beyond shame, beyond even his own name. He was a body at rest, a mind finally silenced, adrift in a vast and merciful darkness. He slept through the rest of that day, through the long, cold night, and through the next dawn, a lost ship finally come to a silent harbour.

When he finally awoke, it was to the gentle light of a new afternoon filtering through the open doorway. The fire was banked, glowing with a soft, steady heat. The hermitage was empty. He sat up, his body a symphony of aches, but the frantic, gnawing cold was gone. The stillness was absolute. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime, there was no shouting in his head. There was no court to face, no father to disappoint, no role to perform. The silence was so complete it felt like a presence, something he could touch. He looked at his hands. They were scraped, bruised, and caked with the dirt of his journey, the nails broken. They were a stranger’s hands, the hands of a labourer, not a prince. He felt a strange dislocation, as if the person who had fled Chase House had been shed somewhere on the moors like a snake’s skin, and he, this new, raw creature, had just been born into the quiet of this room.

The days that followed fell into a rhythm as simple and solid as the stones of the hermitage. Thole did not ask him his name, nor where he had come from, nor what demons had driven him to this remote edge of the world. His presence was a quiet, constant fact, like the wind and the rock. His healing was one of deeds, not words. In the morning, he would hand Alistair a bucket, and Alistair would make the treacherous climb down to the spring that bubbled from a fissure in the rock below the ledge, the cold, clean water a daily baptism. They would work in the garden, their hands in the rich, dark soil, tending the stubborn cabbages and hardy lettuces. Alistair learned to mend tools, to sharpen a blade on a whetstone, to weave rushes into mats for the floor. The work was hard, honest, and demanding of his full attention. It left no room for the phantoms of his mind. He was learning to inhabit his body again, to feel the strain in his muscles, the sting of a splinter, the simple satisfaction of a task completed. His mind, for so long a torture chamber, was becoming a quieter place, the shouting dwindling to a wary murmur.

One afternoon, as they were reinforcing a section of the garden wall that the storm had weakened, a small rock pipit, emboldened by their quiet work, landed on the stones just a few feet from Alistair. He froze. His heart gave a familiar, sickening lurch. He felt the phantom flutter, the cold prickle of dread on his neck. His hand, reaching for a stone, stopped mid-air, trembling. The bird chirped, a small, inconsequential sound, and hopped closer, its head cocked, its bright, black eye fixing him with an unblinking, neutral stare. The murmur in Alistair’s head began to rise in volume. He squeezed his eyes shut. He felt for the river stone in his pocket, its smooth weight a familiar anchor. He did not scream. He did not scramble away. He breathed. When he opened his eyes again, Thole was still working, seemingly oblivious, fitting a stone into place with patient precision. The bird, finding nothing of interest, took flight with a soft whir of wings and was gone. Alistair’s heart was still hammering, but he was not on the floor. He was not undone. He watched his own hand, still trembling, and then slowly, deliberately, he made it pick up the stone he had been reaching for. He placed it on the wall. Thole looked at him then, his gaze calm and direct. "The stone is heavy," he said, his voice even. "The bird is light. That is all."

It was the closest they had come to speaking of his affliction. The conversations, when they happened, were always rooted in the tangible world. They spoke of the weather, of the way the soil held water, of the grain of the wood they were carving into spoons. But in these simple observations, Alistair began to hear a deeper philosophy. One evening, as Thole was carefully tending a wick in a bowl of mutton fat, he spoke of light. "You do not fight the darkness," he said, his eyes on the small, steady flame. "You do not command it to leave. That is a king’s way, and the darkness does not obey kings. You simply make a light. You coax it, you give it fuel, you protect it from the wind. You make a space for the light to exist. That is all." Alistair looked at the small flame, a fragile, golden tear in the immense blackness of the moors, and he understood. He had been fighting his fear, trying to command it, to banish it like a traitor from his own kingdom. He had been acting like a king in the country of his own mind, and he had been routed. Perhaps there was another way. Not to fight the darkness, but to make a light.

Slowly, tentatively, he began to learn. He learned to sit with the silence, and to listen to what rose up within it. The fear was still there. It came upon him at unexpected moments—the shadow of a cloud passing overhead that looked like a great wing, the rustle of the wind in the rushes that sounded like a dry flutter. But he was learning not to run from it. He would stop, breathe, and hold the river stone in his pocket. He would name the reality of his surroundings. *I am on the mountain. The wind is blowing. This stone is in my hand.* He was learning to separate the thing itself from the story his mind told about it. The fear was a storm, but he was not the storm. He was the mountain it battered against, and the mountain remained. He was still the man who was afraid of ducks. He did not know if that would ever change. But he was no longer just a frightened prince. He was a man who knew how to mend a wall, how to find water, how to coax a flame from a spark. He was learning to make a space for the light.The seasons turned on the high moors, each with its own stark and demanding beauty. Summer’s brief, fierce green softened into the thousand shades of autumn rust and gold. The heather, which had been a vibrant purple, faded to a brittle, dusty brown, and the wind carried a new, sharper edge, a promise of the coming ice. Alistair felt the change not just in the air, but in himself. The rhythms of the hermitage had become his own. His hands, once soft and pale, were now calloused and capable, skilled in the quiet arts of survival. He could read the sky for weather, gut a fish with a few deft strokes, and tell the passage of the day by the slow, deliberate march of shadows across the stone. The city of his mind, once a place of riot and screaming, had grown quiet, its avenues orderly, its citizens calm.

He no longer needed to constantly clutch the river stone for reassurance, though he always kept it in his pocket, a small, dense reminder of the journey. The work itself had become his anchor. There was a profound peace in the simple, repetitive act of stacking peat bricks for the winter, each one a solid, earthy block of captured time. There was a deep satisfaction in tending the garden, in coaxing life from the thin, rocky soil. He learned that the world was not a stage for human drama, as it had been at court, but a vast, interconnected system of life and weather and stone, and he was but a small, functional part of it. This knowledge did not diminish him; it liberated him. The crushing weight of being a prince, a symbol, a disappointment, was replaced by the simple, uncomplicated reality of being a man, present in his own life.

The great test came on a crisp, clear morning late in the autumn. It began as a sound, a faint, resonant clamour from the far northern sky, a sound like a distant army’s horns. Alistair was on the ledge, mending a fishing net, his fingers moving with a practiced, easy rhythm. He heard the sound and his hands stilled. It was a chorus, high and wild, and it was growing louder. A familiar coldness seeped into his bones, the old reflex, the ghost of the panic on the lawn. He could feel the shouting start to gather on the edges of his quiet, a murmuring crowd growing restless. His first instinct was to flee into the dark safety of the hermitage, to hide. He saw Brother Thole, who was kneeling by the hearth, look up, his gaze finding Alistair’s across the ledge. Thole did not speak, did not gesture. He simply watched, his expression one of calm, patient waiting.

Alistair took a breath. The air was cold and clean. He forced his gaze away from the safety of the doorway and up towards the sky. He saw them then, a vast, shifting V-formation etched against the pale blue, a skein of wild geese making their long journey south. There were hundreds of them, their powerful wings beating in a steady, hypnotic rhythm. Their calls rained down on him, a wild, barbaric music that vibrated in his chest. It was a sound of immense power and freedom, a sound of the wilderness itself. He felt the fear, a tremor deep within him, a memory of flapping and chaos. But he did not let it become a story. He held his ground. He named what he saw. *They are birds. They are flying south. The sound is their calling. I am on the mountain. My feet are on the stone.* He watched them, and as he watched, the terror began to transform. He saw not a threat, but a wonder. A great, living river in the sky, each bird a part of the whole, driven by an ancient, unknowable instinct. He was not their target. He was merely a witness. The great V passed directly overhead, the sound of their wings a rushing torrent of air, their calls a deafening symphony. And in that moment, beneath the awesome spectacle, Alistair felt not fear, but a profound and humbling awe. He was small, and they were magnificent, and they were all part of the same, wild world. He stood there until the last of them had vanished into the southern haze and the wild music had faded, leaving behind a silence that felt deeper and more sacred than before. When he finally looked back at the hermitage, Thole gave a single, slow nod, and then returned to his work by the fire.

It was a week later that the outside world, which Alistair had come to think of as a distant dream, intruded with the force of a thrown stone. He was returning from the spring, the water in his buckets sloshing with a steady rhythm, when he saw the figure. A man was lying near the base of the path up to the ledge, a splash of colour against the grey rock that was not a man’s usual garb. It was the crimson and gold of the King’s Guard. Alistair’s heart hammered. He left the buckets and scrambled down the path, his mind a sudden chaos of old anxieties. The soldier was young, no older than Alistair himself, and his face was pale with exhaustion, a long, ugly gash on his forehead crusted with dried blood. One of his legs was twisted at an unnatural angle. He had clearly fallen. He was conscious, but barely, his eyes clouded with pain. As Alistair knelt beside him, the soldier’s eyes fluttered open and focused on his face. A flicker of disbelief, then dawning, horrified recognition. "My lord... Prince Alistair?" the soldier whispered, his voice a hoarse croak of astonishment. The name, unspoken for so long, struck Alistair with the force of a physical blow.

With Thole’s help, they carried the soldier up to the hermitage. Thole, with the quiet competence of a man used to mending all things broken, cleaned the gash and set the soldier's leg with surprising gentleness, binding it with splints made from scavenged wood. As the soldier, fortified with soup and a draught of willow-bark tea for the pain, began to recover his senses, the story came tumbling out. His name was Joric, and he had been part of a patrol searching the edges of the Chase for poachers. He had become separated from his men in a sudden fog, his horse had gone lame, and he had been wandering for two days before his fall. And he brought news. It had been almost a year since Alistair’s flight. At first, the King had been consumed by a silent, volcanic rage. He had publicly declared the crown prince dead, a victim of a fever, and had forbidden his name from being spoken. Queen Isolde, he said, had turned her cold fury on Elara, blaming her for the shame Alistair had brought upon the family. Joric spoke of how the princess was now rarely seen outside her chambers, a virtual prisoner of her mother's resentment. The court, sensing a power vacuum, had become a nest of intrigue. King Theron, his line now uncertain, had grown erratic, his rule more brittle and harsh. Cannock, the perpetually damp and predictable kingdom, was becoming a place of fear and instability.

Joric fell into an exhausted sleep, but his words remained, shattering the peace of the hermitage. Alistair sat by the fire, the old world rushing back in, drowning out the quiet he had so painstakingly built. He felt a searing guilt over Elara. She had built the boat that carried him to safety, and for her trouble, she had been locked in the hold of the sinking ship. He had found his quiet room, but he had done so by allowing hers to be taken away. He looked at his calloused hands, hands that had learned to heal and build, and they suddenly felt useless. What good was mending a wall on a remote mountain when the foundations of his own house were crumbling, burying the one person who had shown him kindness? The old titles the soldier had used—my lord, prince—felt like accusations. He had run from his duties, run from his name, and left others to pay the price. The shouting returned, not with the voice of fear, but with the voice of shame.

He walked out onto the ledge. The night was vast and cold, the stars like chips of ice in a black sky. The immensity of the moors, which had once been a comfort, now felt like a mark of his own selfish isolation. He was hiding from the world, a hermit tending to his own soul while the world he was born to burned. He felt Thole’s presence beside him, a solid, quiet shape in the darkness. "The soldier’s words have brought the storm back inside," the hermit observed, his voice a low rumble. "Yes," Alistair said, his own voice tight. "He brought me my name back. I do not want it." "A name is a tool. You can use it as a weapon, or a shield, or a key to open a locked door," Thole said. "The man who fled here could not carry its weight. Perhaps the man who is here now can." Alistair turned to him, his conflict a raw wound. "She is a prisoner because of me. My father, the kingdom... I ran away from it all. To stay here now, in this peace... it feels like the worst kind of cowardice." "And to go back?" Thole asked gently. "What would that be?"

Alistair looked out at the dark, sleeping land that stretched towards the distant memory of his kingdom. He was not the golden-haired heir, the pride of his father. That boy was gone forever, lost in the fog and the fear. He was not a prince who could command armies or inspire loyalty with a calibrated smile. But he was a man who knew what it was to be broken, and what it took to painstakingly piece oneself back together. He was a man who knew the value of a quiet room, and he knew that Elara deserved one of her own. The path ahead was not clear, and it was filled with dangers far more real than phantom birds. But for the first time, he felt a sense of purpose that was not born of duty or expectation, but of a quiet, hard-won conviction. "To go back," Alistair said, the words feeling solid and true in the cold night air, "would be to make a light." Thole was silent for a long moment. "The path to the hermitage is a journey inward," he said finally. "But you do not have to live at the destination. Sometimes, the purpose of the journey is to learn how to carry the hermitage with you." Alistair knew then what he had to do. He would descend the mountain. He would walk back into the world he had fled. He was not going back to reclaim a crown, but to open a cage. The prince had been a creature of straight lines, but the man he was becoming was learning to navigate a much more complex and broken landscape, one step at a time.The decision, once made, settled in Alistair’s bones with the weight and solidity of the mountain itself. The dawn that followed was cold and clear, and as he moved about the small hermitage, his actions were imbued with a new, quiet deliberation. He helped Brother Thole change the dressing on Joric’s wound and check the splints on his leg, his movements now as steady and sure as the hermit’s own. Joric, weak but lucid, watched him with wide, uncomprehending eyes. He saw a man with the lean, weathered look of a hunter, whose hands were gentle but calloused, and he could not reconcile this figure with the memory of the golden-haired prince he had sworn to protect, a prince known more for his perfect posture in the saddle than for any practical skill. The soldier tried to speak, to use the formal titles of the court, but the words died in his throat, seeming absurd and out of place in the profound quiet of the stone room.

Their departure was not a hurried flight but a planned embarkation. Alistair gathered the few things he had: the mended satchel, the waterskin, a small knife Thole had taught him to sharpen to a razor’s edge. He left behind the rough-spun clothes he had worn on his journey up, and instead donned the spare set of soldier’s leathers from Joric’s pack, which the guard insisted he take. They were plain and unmarked, but they felt like a uniform nonetheless, a mantle of purpose he was choosing to wear. When he was ready, he found Thole standing on the ledge, looking not at him, but out at the vast expanse of the moors. For a long moment, neither spoke. The silence was not empty, but filled with a year of shared work, of patient teaching, of unspoken understanding. Alistair reached into his pocket and brought out the river stone, its surface worn to a deep lustre by the constant touch of his hand. He held it out to the hermit.

"I think I can carry the quiet without it now," Alistair said, his voice steady.

Thole looked at the stone in Alistair’s palm, then back to his face. A rare, faint smile touched the corners of his mouth. "A tool is only a tool until the hand learns its own strength," he said. He did not take the stone. "But every man needs a reminder of where he has been. It is a piece of the journey. Keep it." He turned and went back inside the hermitage, emerging a moment later with a small, tightly wrapped oilskin packet. He pressed it into Alistair's other hand. "For the fire," was all he said. It was a complete fire-starting kit: a steel striker, a shard of flint, and a generous bundle of dry, resinous tinder. It was a gift of warmth and light, a practical blessing that held more meaning than any courtly farewell. "The mountain will be here," the hermit stated, a simple fact. "Your work is not." With a final, shared look of profound and quiet gratitude, Alistair turned his back on the only true home he had ever known. He helped Joric to his feet, letting the soldier lean heavily on his shoulder, and together, they began the slow, painstaking descent.

The journey down was a mirror image of the climb, a perfect inversion of his flight. Where before he had scrambled upwards in a desperate, solitary escape from the world, he now guided another man downwards, a deliberate and responsible re-entry. The mountain, which had been his adversary, was now a known landscape whose moods and textures he understood. He knew which stones would hold, which moss-covered slopes to avoid. He moved with a newfound economy of motion, his body remembering the lessons of the rock, while Joric, clumsy on his makeshift crutch, followed with a mixture of pained effort and growing awe. The soldier, a man of the barracks and the training yard, was witnessing a form of mastery he had never imagined, a deep, intuitive competence that had nothing to do with swordplay or strategy. He had stopped trying to call Alistair "My Lord," the title feeling more and more inadequate with every sure-footed step the prince took.

They made camp that night in a sheltered overhang Alistair remembered from his ascent. As darkness fell, he set about his tasks with a quiet efficiency that left Joric speechless. With Thole’s gift, he coaxed a small, bright flame from a spark, building a fire that was nearly smokeless and gave off a steady, comforting heat. He had snared two fat rabbits during a rest stop, and he skinned and cooked them with a swift, practiced skill, the simple meal of roasted meat feeling like a feast. As they ate, Joric finally broke his silence, his voice full of a hesitant wonder. "Where did you learn all this, Your High—" He stopped, catching himself. "Where did you learn to do that?" Alistair looked into the dancing flames, the light flickering across his lean, changed face. He thought of the long, silent days, of the patient repetition, of the slow unlearning of a prince and the painstaking learning of a man. "In a quiet room," he answered simply, and offered the soldier the last, best piece of the meat.

As they drew closer to the lowlands, the character of the wilderness began to change. The stark grandeur of the moors gave way to the familiar, rolling expanse of the Chase. The air grew thicker, heavier, carrying the scent of damp earth and living things. The silence was no longer absolute, but punctuated by the sound of birdsong, the rustle of unseen creatures in the bracken. For a moment, a flicker of the old fear returned with the sound, a tightening in Alistair’s chest at the sudden chatter of a flock of finches. But it was a faint echo, a ghost in a well-lit room. He acknowledged it, breathed through it, and let it pass. He was the mountain, and it was just the wind. He was more concerned with the practical realities of their journey. Joric’s leg was healing, but it slowed them considerably, and their meagre supplies were dwindling. The world of men, with its needs and its dangers, was drawing closer.

They reached the edge of the Chase on the fifth day, at the same stream where Alistair had met the old shepherd. The place was deserted now, the sheep and their master gone, but the memory of the man’s simple, profound words returned to him. *One foot, then the other. Nothin' else for it.* It had been his mantra for survival, a charm against despair. Now, it felt like a mission statement. They stood on a low hill, looking out over the first chequerboard patterns of tamed farmland. In the distance, the smoke of a village smudged the grey sky. It was the end of the wilderness and the beginning of the world. Joric gave a sigh of profound relief, the sight of civilization a balm to his soldier’s soul. But Alistair felt a new kind of tension. In the wild, the dangers were clear: a loose stone, a sudden storm, an empty belly. Here, the dangers were hidden. They were the dangers of names and histories, of allegiances and ambitions. He was no longer an anonymous man on a mountain. He was about to become Prince Alistair again, the ghost returned from the grave. The hermitage he carried within him, the fortress of quiet he had built, was about to face its first true siege.The village of Oakhaven was a shock to the senses. After months in the clean, elemental world of the high moors, the press of humanity felt like a physical assault. The air was thick and layered with the smells of woodsmoke, damp wool, animal dung, and frying bacon, a pungent stew that clogged the throat. The ground, a mire of mud and straw, sucked at Alistair’s boots. The noise was the worst part; a constant, overlapping clamour of shouting children, barking dogs, the ring of a blacksmith's hammer, and the low, rumbling drone of human chatter. It was a cacophony that scraped at the edges of the quiet he had so carefully cultivated. He felt a visceral urge to retreat, to find an empty space, but he held his ground, his hand resting on the hilt of the knife at his belt, a gesture that was less about threat and more about centering himself in this new, chaotic reality.

Joric, by contrast, seemed to draw strength from the squalor. The soldier, leaning heavily on Alistair, breathed it all in with a look of profound relief. This was his world, a world of men and their messy, complicated lives. He navigated them through the throng towards a plume of smoke that indicated an inn, his familiarity with such places evident in his confident stride, despite his injury. The inn was called The Bent Fork, its sign a crudely painted depiction of a farming implement that had seen better days. Inside, the noise and the smells intensified. A haze of pipe smoke hung in the low-beamed room, and the air was hot with the press of bodies. A group of farmers in a corner argued loudly over the price of wool, while a minstrel with more enthusiasm than talent sang a song about a lusty milkmaid. It was a world away from the patient silence of the hermitage. Alistair felt the old anxiety prickle, the desire to shrink, to become invisible.

He consciously stilled the impulse. He remembered Thole’s voice, calm and steady in the vastness of the moors. *You do not fight the darkness. You make a light.* He found a shadowed corner table, taking the seat that faced the wall, leaving Joric to face the room. He focused on a single point—a deep crack in the wooden table—and regulated his breathing, letting the wave of noise wash over him without allowing it to breach the walls of his inner quiet. He was the mountain. This was just the wind. Joric, meanwhile, hobbled to the bar, his soldier's uniform and his obvious injury earning him a measure of rough sympathy from the innkeeper. He returned a few moments later with a pitcher of dark ale and two wooden platters heaped with bread and a stew of indeterminate origin. "Got us a room for the night," he said, his voice a low conspiratorial murmur. "Upstairs, by the back. He thinks we're deserters from the northern border patrol. It's a better story than the truth."

They ate in silence, Alistair forcing the greasy stew down, his stomach unaccustomed to such heavy fare. But more than eating, he was listening. He let the currents of conversation in the room flow around him, picking out the words and phrases that mattered. The talk was grim. King Theron’s name was spoken with a new kind of fear, a nervous respect laced with resentment. A farmer complained of a new tax on grain, a levy to fund a new wing for the castle that no one wanted. Another man spoke in a hushed, angry whisper of his cousin, who had been put in the stocks for a week for speaking ill of the Queen in his own home. The atmosphere was one of sullen, simmering discontent, a kingdom whose cheerful, grumbling tolerance had curdled into quiet dread. It was worse than he had imagined. The rot had spread far beyond the castle walls.

Alistair was so absorbed in his eavesdropping that he did not at first notice the old man staring at him from across the room. The man was thin and stooped, his face a web of wrinkles, and he was nursing a small cup of ale as if it were a precious jewel. But his eyes, though clouded with age, were sharp and focused, fixed on Alistair's face with an unnerving intensity. Alistair felt the gaze like a physical touch and instinctively lowered his head, pulling the collar of his leather jerkin higher. He felt a cold dread pool in his stomach, a fear not of feathers, but of memory. The old man began to rise, a dawning, incredulous light in his eyes, his mouth opening as if to speak a name. In a single, fluid motion, Joric, who had seen the exchange, lurched to his feet, knocking his stool over with a loud clatter. "Damn this leg!" he roared, feigning a spasm of pain and grabbing the table for support. The diversion was perfect. Every eye in the common room, including the old man’s, snapped towards him. The innkeeper rushed over, and in the ensuing commotion, Alistair became just another face in the background. The moment passed. The old man, confused, eventually sat back down, the flicker of recognition in his eyes fading into uncertainty.

Later, in the cramped, musty-smelling room upstairs, the reality of their situation settled in. The single window looked out over a muddy alleyway, and the sounds of the inn were a muffled but constant presence. "That was too close," Joric said, his face grim as he tested the weight on his injured leg. "The old man, I think he used to be a groundskeeper at the castle. Another hour and half the village would know the ghost prince was drinking in their tavern." He looked at Alistair, his expression a mixture of a soldier's pragmatism and a newfound respect. "We cannot do this alone. And we cannot simply walk up to the gates. The guard has been changed. The men I knew, the ones loyal to your father's house, not just the man... many have been dismissed or reassigned. Queen Isolde has been seeing to it that her own people are in place."

Alistair sat on the edge of the lumpy straw mattress, the noise from downstairs a dull thrum against the floorboards. He felt the weight of his name, his history, settling back onto his shoulders, but it was a different weight now. It was not a burden of expectation, but a mantle of responsibility. He had thought to return simply to free Elara, a personal quest. But the stories from the common room painted a picture of a kingdom in distress. His duty was larger than he had imagined. "Who can we trust?" he asked, the question direct and clear. His voice was no longer that of a prince seeking counsel, but of a commander assessing his options.

Joric paced the small room, the floorboards groaning under his weight. "There are a few. Men of honor, who are disturbed by the King's... change. But they are cautious. To side with a ghost against a living king is treason. We need someone whose loyalty to you, to what you represented, is stronger than their fear of the King." He stopped, his gaze fixed on Alistair. "Sir Kaelan. The Master of Horse. He taught you to ride. He served your grandfather. His loyalty is to the crown of Cannock, not just the man who wears it. The Queen dislikes him, thinks him an old relic. He has been sidelined, but his influence with the old guard, the core of the army, is still strong. If there is one man who would risk everything for the true heir, it is him."

The plan began to form in the small, dark room, a single point of light in the growing gloom. They could not approach Sir Kaelan directly. But a message, one that could only have come from Alistair, might be enough to arrange a secret meeting. Joric spoke of a young stable boy at the castle, Tam, whose family he had helped in the past. A boy who was quick-witted, unnoticed, and in his debt. He could be their messenger. "But the message itself is the key," Joric insisted. "It must have a sign, a token. Something only you and Sir Kaelan would know, to prove you are who you say you are." Alistair fell silent, his mind casting back through the years, through a life that felt like it belonged to someone else. He thought of his first pony, of fencing lessons, of long rides with Kaelan through the Chase. And then he remembered. He reached into his pocket and his fingers closed around the smooth, familiar shape of the river stone. It was a piece of his journey, Thole had said. But its story was older than that. He remembered a day, years ago, when he was a boy of ten, frustrated with a difficult lesson. Kaelan had found him by the river, ready to give up. The old knight had picked up a dark, smooth stone from the water’s edge. ‘Even the sharpest rock can be made smooth by the current, my prince,’ he had said. ‘Patience and persistence can shape anything.’ He had given the stone to Alistair that day. He had long since lost that original stone, but the memory, the lesson, remained. Now, holding Thole’s stone, the two journeys, the two lessons, merged into one.

"I have the token," Alistair said, his voice quiet but certain. He would not send the stone itself, but a message that would evoke its memory. He looked at Joric, his eyes clear and resolved in the dim candlelight. The fear was a distant country. The shame, a forgotten language. He was no longer a prince running from a ridiculous fear. He was a man returning to a dangerous duty, armed not with a sword, but with a hard-won quiet and the memory of a simple stone. He was ready to make his first move. He would send his message into the heart of the castle, a single, small light against the encroaching darkness.The tiny, second-floor room of The Bent Fork was a prison of stale air and nervous energy. Below, the raucous life of the inn rumbled on, a constant, muffled reminder of the world they had re-entered. Joric, having bartered a portion of their dwindling coin, procured the necessary tools for their delicate operation: a brittle sheet of cheap parchment, a goose quill that had seen better days, and a small pot of watery ink. He set them on the rickety table that wobbled under the slightest pressure, the meager supplies for a gambit that could either save a kingdom or see them both hanging from its walls. Alistair sat before the parchment not with the flourish of a prince accustomed to signing decrees, but with the focused stillness of a craftsman. He did not dip the quill immediately. He closed his eyes, and in the humming chaos of the inn, he found the quiet centre he had learned to build. He brought to mind the river, the lesson, and the gruff, unwavering loyalty of the man he was trying to reach.

When he finally wrote, his hand was steady. The script was not the elegant, flowing hand of his youth, but something sparer, more angular, shaped by a year of practical necessity rather than courtly education. The message was brief, each word chosen with the care of a man building a bridge over a chasm. *Sir Kaelan,* it began, a formal acknowledgment of the man’s station. *The lesson of the river stone is learned. The current has done its work. A hunter’s moon rises in three nights. I would learn how the old oaks watch the water.* He did not sign his name. The words themselves were the signature, a key cut from a shared and private memory. The final sentence was a suggestion for a meeting place—a secluded spot by the castle pond, where a stand of ancient oak trees stood sentinel, a place Kaelan would know from countless hours spent watching his young charge practice his horsemanship nearby. Alistair folded the small parchment with meticulous care and sealed it with a drop of wax from a guttering candle, pressing his thumb into the soft surface, leaving a plain, anonymous whorl.

As true darkness fell, swallowing the muddy lanes of Oakhaven in an inky blackness, Joric prepared to depart. He moved with a stiff, pained deliberation, but his eyes were sharp with purpose. Alistair watched him from the shadows of the room as the soldier wrapped his injured leg in fresh bindings and pulled a dark cloak over his uniform. It was the first time Alistair had been left truly alone since their descent from the mountain, and a flicker of the old vulnerability threatened to surface. The pressing walls, the unseen, unknowable movements of the people below, the sheer weight of what they were attempting—it was a perfect storm for the shouting to begin. But he met the feeling head-on, not with resistance, but with acknowledgement. He sat on the lumpy mattress, closed his eyes, and focused on the sensation of his own breathing, a quiet, internal rhythm against the external chaos. He was not a prince waiting nervously in a squalid room. He was a man holding a quiet space, waiting for his ally to return.

The stables of Chase House were a world unto themselves, a city of hay and leather and the warm, animal scent of horses. Joric moved along the outer walls like a phantom, his knowledge of the castle’s routines a map in his mind. He found Tam not in the main stables, but in a small, isolated tack room, polishing a set of ceremonial bridles by the light of a single, foul-smelling tallow lamp. The boy was no more than fifteen, with a shock of unruly brown hair and the perpetually wary eyes of someone who lived at the bottom of the pecking order. When Joric’s shadow fell across the doorway, the boy started violently, dropping a silver buckle with a clatter. Fear, stark and immediate, whitened his face. Joric stepped into the light, his hand raised in a gesture of peace. "Quiet, lad," he whispered, his voice a low, calming rumble. "It's just me. Joric. Do you remember?" The boy’s fear slowly gave way to a disbelieving awe. He remembered the guardsman who had stopped a bully from tormenting him, the man who had once slipped him a meat pie from the kitchens on a cold winter's night. He nodded, his eyes wide. The exchange was swift and low. Joric pressed the folded parchment and a silver coin into the boy's hand. "This is for Sir Kaelan's eyes only. No one else. Give it to him when he makes his final inspection. Your life, and mine, depend on your silence." The boy looked from the coin to the note, his mind grappling with the enormity of the secret. He gave a single, jerky nod, his loyalty won not by the coin, but by the memory of a kindness.

The next day was a study in the slow, torturous passage of time. The sun rose, arced across the sky, and set, and no word came. Alistair passed the hours in a state of active stillness. He took out the whetstone Thole had given him and sharpened his knife with a slow, rhythmic patience, the grating sound of steel on stone a meditative focus. The simple, repetitive task anchored him, kept his mind from spiraling into the dark vortex of ‘what if’. What if Tam was caught? What if Kaelan had thrown the note in the fire, his loyalty to the unstable King overriding any sentiment for a long-lost prince? What if the old knight was himself a prisoner, watched by the Queen's spies? Joric was less successful at hiding his anxiety. He paced the small room like a caged wolf, his limp more pronounced, his gaze constantly flicking to the door. He represented the man Alistair used to be, a creature of action driven to madness by forced inaction. Alistair, however, simply continued his work, the steady scrape of the stone a quiet defiance against the encroaching doubt.

It was well after dark on the second night when the signal came. A faint, furtive scratching at the door, like a mouse in the wainscoting. Alistair was on his feet in an instant, knife in hand, his body coiled. Joric threw the bar and pulled the door open a crack. Tam slipped inside, his face pale and streaked with grime, his breathing coming in ragged gasps. He looked as though he had been running for his life. "I gave it to him," the boy whispered, his voice trembling. "He took me into his private office. His face... he looked like he'd seen a ghost." The boy recounted how Sir Kaelan had read the note several times, his hand shaking, before burning it in the flame of his lamp. The old knight had asked Tam a dozen sharp questions, his eyes boring into the boy, testing his story, his nerve. Tam had held firm. The close call had come an hour ago, when one of Isolde's new household guards had stopped and questioned him for being near the Master of Horse’s quarters so late. He had used the excuse of a sick mare, but the guard’s suspicious eyes had followed him all the way back to the stables.

Clutching the worn fabric of his tunic, the boy finally relayed Sir Kaelan's reply. It was not a note. It was a verbal message, a test wrapped in a memory. "He told me to say this, and only this," Tam recited, his brow furrowed in concentration. "'The grey mare always casts a shoe before the long ride.'" The words landed in the small room, meaningless to Joric, but to Alistair they were a key turning in a lock deep within his memory. It was a reference to a specific, deeply frustrating incident before his first major tournament. His prized grey mare, Lyra, had thrown a shoe during the final practice, an event that had sent the young, petulant prince into a storm of fury and despair. Only Kaelan's gruff, steady patience had calmed him, the knight working alongside the farrier through half the night to ensure the horse was ready. It was a moment of shared crisis, a memory of his own youthful arrogance and Kaelan's unwavering support, a secret known only to the two of them. It was a definitive, unforgeable confirmation.

A slow smile, the first genuine smile Joric had ever seen on his face, touched Alistair's lips. The bridge had held. But Tam was not finished. "Then he said," the boy continued, his voice dropping even lower, "'The hunter’s moon is for hunters and fools. The west gate will be unbarred for one hour after the midnight bell strikes. Come alone. Prove the current has done its work.'" The final words were a direct challenge, a demand. Come alone. Joric immediately began to protest. "It's a trap. Or a test you cannot afford to fail. Let me go with you, my lord. I can watch from the shadows." Alistair raised a hand, silencing him. The quiet authority in the gesture was absolute. "No. He is a cautious man in a dangerous house. He is testing my courage, but more than that, he is testing my judgment. If I cannot trust him, I can trust no one." He looked from Joric's worried face to the terrified but resolute stable boy. His decision was instant. He was no longer just a man trying to survive. He was a prince, and these were his people. He turned to the shadows by the window, his profile stark and determined. He would walk into the lion’s den, armed not with a prince’s retinue, but with a hermit’s quiet and a will of iron. He would prove that the current had, indeed, done its work.The silence of the stable office was broken only by the dry crackle of the old parchment as Sir Kaelan smoothed it flat on his desk. The map depicted Chase House not as a home, but as a tactical problem, a maze of stone and secrets. For Alistair, it was a disorienting perspective. The corridors he had run down as a boy were now potential lines of attack; the gardens where he had once sulked were now kill zones. Kaelan’s blunt, calloused finger traced a path across the vellum, a general planning his campaign. His voice was a low, urgent whisper, each word stripped of sentiment, honed to a sharp, practical edge. He detailed the changes to the guard rotations, the placement of Isolde’s loyalists, the blind spots in the castle’s defences. He spoke of men they could trust: a captain of the old guard named Gregor, whose loyalty was to the memory of Alistair’s mother; a master mason who knew every hidden priest-hole and forgotten passage in the castle’s ancient walls. A network of silent dissent lay dormant within the court, waiting for a spark.

“The Queen is clever, but her arrogance is her weakness,” Kaelan explained, his finger tapping the base of the north tower on the map. “She believes her power is absolute, that no one would dare move against her. The guards on Elara’s tower are her own men, chosen for loyalty, not competence. They are bullies and sycophants, not soldiers. A well-staged diversion would draw the bulk of the main guard, and these peacocks would be the first to leave their posts to see the excitement.” The plan they formulated was one of elegant simplicity, relying on precise timing and an intimate knowledge of the castle’s rhythms. A fire, set in the haylofts at the eastern edge of the stables, would be the primary diversion. The resulting chaos—panicked horses, shouting grooms, the entire garrison turning out to fight the blaze and prevent it from spreading to the main keep—would provide the perfect cover.

During the confusion, Kaelan and a handful of his most trusted men would secure the courtyard below the north tower. Alistair’s role was the most perilous. He would use the distraction to get inside the tower itself. The master mason, a man named Borin, would meet him at a small, sealed-up service entrance at the tower’s base, a relic from a time when servants used a separate, narrow staircase. Borin would open the way, and from there, Alistair would be on his own. He would have to ascend the tower, overcome the remaining guards, and reach Elara before the Queen realised the fire was a ruse. “There is a risk,” Kaelan warned, his eyes grave. “Once you are inside that tower, you are cut off. If the alarm is raised before you have the princess, they will seal you in. You will be a fox in a barrel.” Alistair met his gaze without flinching. “I have been in a cage before. I know the way out.”

Their meeting concluded as the first hint of grey began to lighten the eastern sky, a warning that the dangerous hours of daylight were approaching. Kaelan provided Alistair with a new hiding place, a small, forgotten cellar beneath the armoury, accessible only through a hidden hatch in the floor of his office. It was cramped, damp, and smelled of rust and cold earth, but it was safe. He also gave him a heavy, dark wool cloak with a deep cowl, a sword—a plain, unadorned soldier’s blade, perfectly balanced—and a purse of coins. “You will need to live for two days,” Kaelan said. “The fire must be set on the night of the new moon. It provides the deepest darkness and the city watch will be at its weakest. Stay hidden. Eat what I bring you. Do not make a sound. The walls have ears, and Isolde’s rats are everywhere.” With a final, firm clasp of the arm, the old knight disappeared back through the secret door, leaving Alistair alone in the cold, absolute dark of the cellar, the weight of the sword in his hand a heavy, unfamiliar promise.

The next forty-eight hours were a descent into a quiet unlike any he had ever known. The hermitage had been a place of open, airy silence, filled with the sounds of wind and life. This cellar was the suffocating, subterranean quiet of the grave. Time ceased to be measured by the sun and became a thick, slow-moving river of darkness. Once a day, Kaelan would appear with a hunk of bread, a flask of water, and a whispered update. The rest of the time, Alistair was utterly alone with his thoughts. He did not fight the confinement. Instead, he embraced it, using the techniques Thole had taught him. He sat in meditative stillness for hours, focusing on the slow, steady rhythm of his own breathing, letting the darkness be a space for clarity rather than a trigger for fear. He practiced moving in the pitch-black, learning the dimensions of his small prison by touch, his senses growing preternaturally sharp. He held the cool, unyielding steel of the sword, its purpose a clear, cold reality in his hand. He was not a prince waiting for rescue. He was a weapon, being honed in the dark.

On the night of the new moon, the air in the cellar felt different, charged with a palpable tension. Kaelan appeared, his face a grim mask in the lantern light. “All is ready,” he said, his voice a low growl. “Gregor’s men are in position. Borin is waiting. The hay is soaked with oil. We light the flame on the second bell after midnight.” He handed Alistair a coil of rope and a small, wickedly sharp dagger. “The tower guards may have the key, but a knife in the ribs is a key of its own. Do not hesitate. They would show you no mercy.” There were no grand words of encouragement, no speeches about destiny or right. There was only the grim understanding of the bloody work ahead. Alistair strapped the sword to his back, concealed beneath the heavy cloak, and tucked the dagger into his boot. As he pulled the cowl over his head, casting his face in deep shadow, he was no longer a prince or a hermit. He was an instrument of his own design, ready for his purpose.

They emerged from the hidden door into the sleeping stable. The night was a starless, ink-black void, the perfect cloak for their treachery. They moved silently towards the eastern haylofts, their footsteps muffled by the thick layer of straw on the ground. Kaelan handed Alistair a torch, its head wrapped in an oil-soaked rag. As the second bell began its toll, a deep, mournful tone that rolled across the silent castle, Kaelan gave a curt nod. Alistair struck his flint against the steel striker, a shower of sparks catching on the tinder. He lit the torch, the sudden whoosh of flame a shocking violation of the darkness. For a moment, he held the fire in his hand, a tangible piece of the light he had vowed to create. Then, without a word, he strode to the open door of the hayloft and thrust the torch deep into the mountain of dry, oil-soaked hay.

The effect was instantaneous and terrifyingly beautiful. The hay erupted not into a slow burn but into a hungry, roaring explosion of light and heat. A column of golden flame shot upwards, licking at the stable’s high, timbered roof, painting the entire courtyard in a flickering, hellish light. Shouts of alarm erupted almost immediately, followed by the frantic, high-pitched whinnying of terrified horses. Doors were thrown open, and half-dressed men poured into the courtyard, their faces masks of panic in the firelight. The chaos had begun. In the midst of the pandemonium, Alistair was a calm, dark shape, a ghost moving against the tide. He pulled his cowl lower and sprinted across the courtyard, the screams and the roaring flames a wall of sound at his back. He reached the base of the north tower, where a hulking, bearded man—Borin, the mason—was working frantically with a crowbar at the mortar around a large, inconspicuous stone. With a final, grating heave, the stone came loose, revealing a dark, narrow opening. Borin glanced at the approaching chaos, then at Alistair. "Go," he grunted. "And give the she-wolf a bite from me." Alistair slipped through the opening into the cold, musty-smelling darkness of the tower, and the stone was scraped back into place behind him, sealing him in. The siege had begun.The darkness that swallowed him was absolute. It was a solid, physical presence, thick with the scent of cold stone, ancient dust, and the damp, metallic smell of places long forgotten. The grating scrape of the stone sealing the entrance was a sound of finality, the closing of a tomb. Outside, the muffled roar of the fire and the faint, tinny screams of men were sounds from another world, a chaotic drama playing out on a distant stage. Here, there was only the profound, ringing silence of the tower’s heart and the frantic, yet controlled, beating of his own. The boy who had fled into the fog would have been undone by this suffocating blackness, his mind a fertile ground for gibbering terrors. But the man who stood here now was a creature of the dark, honed by it, comfortable in its embrace. He did not panic. He simply stood for a long count of ten, letting his eyes adjust to a blackness that would not yield, letting his other senses awaken and stretch into the void.

He reached out a hand, his calloused fingers finding the rough, cold texture of the curved stone wall. He began to move, not with a prince’s confident stride, but with the shuffling, sensitive gait of a blind man, one hand tracing the wall, his feet testing the uneven ground before committing his weight. He found it within a dozen paces: the beginning of a staircase, narrow and unwelcoming, spiraling up into the unseen heights of the tower. The air that flowed down it was faint but perceptibly cooler, carrying with it a faint trace of woodsmoke and something else, a subtle scent of lavender and old paper that was so intrinsically Elara it struck him with the force of a memory. She was up there. He placed a foot on the first step, the worn stone gritty beneath his boot, and began to climb, a ghost ascending into the belly of the beast.

The ascent was a slow, vertical crawl through utter blackness. The stairwell was a tight, claustrophobic corkscrew, clearly designed for slim servants carrying trays, not a broad-shouldered man with a sword on his back. He had to angle his body, his shoulder brushing against the central pillar, the hilt of his sword scraping occasionally against the outer wall with a sound that seemed deafeningly loud in the oppressive quiet. He controlled his breathing, making it slow and deep, a silent rhythm to measure his progress. After what felt like an eternity, a faint, flickering orange light began to bleed into the darkness from above. It was not the steady light of a lamp, but the wild, dancing glow of the fire in the stables, cast through a high, narrow arrow-slit. With the light came sound: voices, lazy and complaining, echoing down the stone throat of the stairwell.

He flattened himself against the cold curve of the wall, his body becoming one with the shadows. The voices belonged to two men. "Should be down there," one grumbled, his voice thick and petulant. "Missing all the fun. A good fire's the only excitement this damp rock has seen in a year." The other laughed, a short, ugly bark. "Let the old guard earn their keep. The Queen pays us to watch the little mouse in her cage. Easy coin, I say. She never makes a sound, anyway. Think she’s even still breathing up there?" The casual cruelty of the words sent a spike of cold fury through Alistair, a feeling so pure and clean it burned away the last vestiges of his hesitation. These were not soldiers. They were jailers, vultures, and he was the hawk sent to scatter them.

He reached the source of the light: a small landing where the stairs made a tight turn. A single guard stood framed against the arrow-slit, his silhouette a dark shape against the lurid, dancing firelight outside. He was captivated by the spectacle, his back completely to the stairwell, his spear resting carelessly against the wall beside him. It was a fatal lapse in discipline, born of arrogance and contempt for his duty. Alistair did not draw his sword; its scrape from the scabbard would be a death knell. He drew the dagger from his boot, its wicked point gleaming in the reflected light. He took the last three steps in a single, fluid motion, a predator’s silent rush. There was no shout, no battle cry. His left arm snaked around the guard’s throat, cutting off any scream, his hand clamping over the man's mouth. At the same instant, he drove the dagger up and under the man’s ribs, a single, deep, decisive thrust. The guard’s body went rigid, a choked, wet gasp the only sound he made. Alistair held him for a moment as the life fled, the man's weight a sudden, heavy burden, then gently lowered the body to the stone floor, the armour clinking softly.

Alistair stood over the still form, his own breathing harsh in the sudden silence. The distant roar of the fire seemed very far away. He looked at the dagger in his hand, its blade black with warm, sticky blood. He felt no triumph, no horror, only the grim, hollow finality of a necessary act. This was the cost of opening a cage. This was the bite Borin had asked for. With a detached practicality that would have shocked the boy he once was, he knelt and wiped the blade clean on the dead man's tunic, the coarse fabric absorbing the stain. He searched the man's belt, his fingers finding a heavy iron key. He took it, then rose and continued his ascent, stepping over the cooling body without a second glance. The hermitage had taught him to survive; the tower was teaching him to fight.

The final flight of stairs was shorter. At the top was a solid oak door, bound with iron straps. A torch sputtered in a sconce beside it, casting a pool of greasy, flickering light and revealing a second guard, who was seated on a stool, his chin on his chest, dozing. The first guard's confidence had been his undoing; this one's boredom was his. The man snorted in his sleep, his head lolling to one side. Alistair saw it all in a single, cold assessment: the man's posture, the sword leaning against the wall just out of his immediate reach, the path he would need to take to get to the door. He could try to kill this one silently as well, but the risk of a cry, of a fumbled struggle right at Elara's door, was too high. He needed to be faster than thought. He took a deep breath, centered himself in the quiet he carried within, and stepped out of the stairwell and into the torchlight.The guard snorted, a wet, rattling sound in his throat, his body slumping further onto the stool. He was a man drowning in a shallow sea of sleep, oblivious to the predator that had just stepped into the light. Alistair did not waste the opportunity on a complex plan. He took two long, silent strides, closing the distance between them in a heartbeat. He did not draw his sword. Instead, his right hand shot out and gripped the hilt, but kept the blade sheathed. In one smooth, brutal motion, he swung the entire weight of the sheathed weapon like a mace. The heavy, steel-wrapped pommel connected with the side of the guard’s head with a sickening, fleshy thud. The man’s eyes fluttered open for a fraction of a second, registering nothing but a blur of motion, before they rolled back into his head. He did not cry out. He simply folded, slumping from the stool and collapsing onto the stone floor in a boneless, silent heap.

Silence reclaimed the landing, broken only by the distant, angry crackle of the fire and the frantic beating of Alistair’s own heart. Two guards down. The path was clear. He found the heavy iron key he had taken from the first guard, his fingers surprisingly steady as he slid it into the lock of the heavy oak door. The mechanism was old and stiff. The sound of the tumblers grinding and then catching with a loud, definitive *clunk* seemed to echo through the very stones of the tower. For a terrifying moment, Alistair froze, certain the sound would alert the entire castle, but the chaos from the courtyard was a thick blanket of noise, swallowing his small intrusion. He took a steadying breath, turned the handle, and pushed the door inward.

The room was spare, almost monastic, but it was unmistakably Elara’s. A narrow bed was pushed against one wall, its blankets neatly folded. A small table held a single tallow candle, its flame a small, lonely star against the wild, flickering orange light that poured through the room's single, barred window. But it was the books that marked the space as hers. They were everywhere, stacked in precarious towers on the floor, lining the deep windowsill, filling every available surface. It was a cage, but a cage she had lined with words and stories, her own private hermitage in the heart of her prison. She was standing at the window, her back to the door, a slender silhouette against the backdrop of the burning stables. She was utterly still, a creature of quiet watching the chaos unfold.

Alistair stepped into the room, his boots silent on the cold stone, and softly closed the door behind him. The sound, small as it was, made her turn. Her face was thinner than he remembered, her pale skin almost translucent in the dancing light, but her eyes were the same—those unnervingly clear, grey eyes that saw everything. There was no scream, no gasp of fright. Her gaze swept over him, taking in the dark cloak, the grim set of his jaw, the weapon at his back. A flicker of shock passed through her expression, a momentary widening of her eyes, but it was immediately replaced by something else, a deep, weary, and absolute recognition. It was as if she had been expecting a ghost, and was only mildly surprised when one finally appeared.

“I came to open the cage,” Alistair said, his voice a low rasp he barely recognised as his own. The grand, heroic words he might have once practiced for such a moment felt hollow and absurd. All that was left was the simple, unadorned truth.

A faint, wry smile, the ghost of her old wit, touched Elara's lips. She looked from his face to the window, where a section of the stable roof collapsed in a shower of sparks and embers. “You do make a mess, Alistair,” she said, her voice as soft and steady as ever. Then she looked back at him, and the smile faded, replaced by the profound, quiet understanding that had always been the foundation of their strange alliance. “I knew you would come back.”

He crossed the room in three strides, the distance between them suddenly feeling vast and unbridgeable. There was so much to say, a year of guilt and gratitude and transformation to account for, but there was no time for any of it. He reached out, his hand hesitating for a moment before he gently touched her arm, as if to confirm she was real. “Kaelan is waiting,” he said, his voice urgent. “The fire is our only chance. We have to go. Now.” She did not question him. She did not ask for details. She simply gave a single, decisive nod and turned to a small, worn leather satchel that sat on her bed. She had been ready. The thought sent a fresh pang of guilt through him; she had been living her life, even in this cage, waiting for the moment the door would open. As she slung the satchel over her shoulder, a new sound cut through the din from outside—a series of sharp, commanding shouts from the base of the tower. The diversion was beginning to fray. Their time was running out.

Alistair pulled the coil of rope from his belt. "Just in case the stairs are no longer an option," he said grimly. He moved to the door, opened it a crack, and listened. The shouts were closer now, followed by the heavy, rhythmic thud of armoured feet ascending a staircase—not their narrow, secret one, but the main tower stairs. The alarm had been raised. He met Elara’s calm, questioning gaze over his shoulder. “They know,” he said, his voice grim. "The party's over." He held the door for her, and she slipped out onto the landing without a moment's hesitation, her eyes falling on the unconscious form of the guard on the floor. She did not flinch, her expression merely thoughtful, as if taking note of a necessary but unpleasant fact. Alistair followed her out, pulling the heavy door shut behind them. Together, they turned to the dark, waiting maw of the secret stairwell, and plunged back into the blackness, a prince and a princess turned fugitives, descending together into the heart of the fire they had lit.The descent was an exercise in controlled haste. Alistair went first, moving backwards down the tight spiral, his hand firmly gripping Elara’s. In the absolute darkness, his touch was her only guide, a solid, reassuring pressure against the chaos that had erupted around them. For him, the blackness was a familiar cloak, a known quantity. He moved with a quiet confidence that belied the frantic pounding of his heart, his feet finding the worn stones with a learned certainty. He was her eyes, her anchor in the disorienting void, a reversal of roles so profound it felt like the final click of a lock falling into place. He was no longer the one being led through the dark passages of the mind; he was the guide, his purpose as clear and simple as the pressure of her hand in his.

They reached the landing where the first guard lay, a dark shape huddled against the wall. The lurid, flickering light from the arrow-slit cast the scene in a demonic tableau. Alistair tried to position his body to shield her from the sight, a clumsy, protective instinct, but Elara’s perception was too keen. She saw the sprawled form, the unnatural angle of the head, the dark stain that had pooled on the stones beneath the man's body. He felt her hand tighten in his for a fraction of a second, a small, sharp intake of breath the only sound she made. She did not recoil or cry out. She simply looked from the dead man to Alistair’s shadowed face, and in that brief, silent exchange, she understood the price he had paid to reach her. It was a grim accounting, a debt acknowledged and accepted without a word, and then they were moving again, descending past the body and back into the suffocating darkness below.

At the base of the tower, the air was thick with the smell of dust and stagnant water. The muffled roar of the fire was louder here, a constant, threatening presence just beyond the stone. Alistair released Elara’s hand and put his shoulder to the massive stone Borin had dislodged. It was impossibly heavy, its dead weight resisting him. For a heart-stopping moment, he felt a surge of panic; they were trapped. He heard shouts from outside, closer now, and the distinct clang of steel on steel. The diversion was turning into a battle. Gritting his teeth, he braced his feet on the uneven floor and heaved, not with the clean, explosive power of a fencer’s lunge, but with the raw, grinding strength of a man who had spent a year moving rocks and hauling water. The stone groaned, scraping against its frame, and shifted a few precious inches, allowing a sliver of fiery, chaotic light to pierce their tomb. It was enough. "Stay behind me," he whispered, and squeezed through the narrow gap, emerging into a world of fire and pandemonium.

The courtyard was a scene from a nightmare. The entire eastern wing of the stables was a raging inferno, spitting sparks and embers into the night sky like a malevolent dragon. Men rushed past them, their faces slick with sweat and panic, their shouts lost in the roaring furnace of the fire. The air was a searing wave of heat that stung the eyes and choked the lungs. Alistair pulled his cowl lower, grabbing Elara’s arm and pulling her into the deep shadow of the tower wall. He scanned the chaos, his senses sharp, filtering the noise, searching for a pattern. He saw Kaelan’s men, the old guard, moving with a disciplined purpose amidst the panic, directing the bucket brigades away from the north tower, subtly shaping the flow of the chaos. Then he saw them, a patrol of five of Isolde’s household guards, their crimson and gold livery garish in the firelight, moving with grim intent not towards the fire, but towards the tower they had just exited. They had been sent to investigate the lack of response from the jailers.

“This way,” he hissed, pulling Elara along the base of the wall, using the deep, dancing shadows as their path. They skirted the edge of the main courtyard, moving towards a darkened archway near the master armoury, the designated rendezvous point. The heat from the fire was a physical blow on one side, the cold stone of the castle a chilling presence on the other. Just as they reached the archway, a figure stepped out to meet them. It was Sir Kaelan, his craggy face grim, his sword already drawn. Two of his most trusted men were with him, their faces set like granite. The relief that flooded Alistair was so intense it was almost painful. "They know," Alistair said, the words unnecessary. Kaelan nodded curtly. "The Queen is not a fool. The fire bought time, nothing more."

His words were cut short as the patrol of Isolde’s men rounded the corner, their captain spotting the cluster of figures in the archway. The man’s eyes widened, first in confusion, then in triumphant, venomous recognition as the firelight caught the edge of Alistair’s face beneath his cowl. “Traitors!” the captain roared, his voice cutting through the din. “It’s the ghost! To me! For the Queen!” There was no time for thought, no time for strategy. The captain and his men charged, their swords raised. Kaelan and his veterans met them head-on with a crash of steel that echoed in the narrow space. It was not a duel; it was a brawl, a desperate, ugly skirmish in the flickering shadows. Kaelan fought with the deadly economy of an old wolf, his movements short, brutal, and efficient. Alistair shoved Elara deeper into the archway and drew his own blade, its plain steel a grim, colourless grey in the firelight.

A soldier, younger than the rest, broke past Kaelan’s men and came straight for him, his face a mask of furious ambition, seeing a chance to make his name. He swung his sword in a wide, powerful arc aimed to cut Alistair in half. The prince of the fencing yard would have met it with an elegant parry. The hermit from the mountain simply took a half-step back, letting the blow whistle past, and then lunged forward, not with his sword, but with his body. He slammed his shoulder into the man’s chest, driving him off balance. As the soldier stumbled, Alistair brought the pommel of his sword up in a vicious arc, striking the man under the chin. There was a sharp crack of teeth and bone, and the soldier crumpled to the ground. Alistair did not pause to look. He turned, his eyes scanning for the next threat, his mind a place of cold, clear calm. He was not fighting for glory or honour. He was fighting to clear a path. He was fighting for the quiet room.

Another guard lunged at him, but before Alistair could react, a piercing cry came from the shadows behind him. “Alistair, above you!” It was Elara. His eyes flicked upwards. On the walkway above the armoury, another of Isolde’s men, having circled around, had knelt and was leveling a crossbow, the firelight glinting on the polished bolt. Time seemed to slow. There was no way to dodge, no way to block. As the man’s finger tightened on the trigger, Elara, with a speed born of pure desperation, grabbed a discarded wooden bucket from the ground and hurled it with all her strength at the wall below the crossbowman. The clatter of the bucket against the stone was just loud enough, just startling enough, to make the man flinch. His shot went wide, the bolt thudding into the stone archway a hand's-breadth from Alistair’s head. In that same instant, one of Kaelan’s men looked up, drew a throwing knife from his belt, and sent it spinning through the air. The crossbowman gave a choked cry and pitched forward off the walkway, landing in the courtyard with a sickening crunch.

“Go! Now!” Kaelan roared, dispatching the last of the patrol with a brutal thrust. He pointed with his sword towards the dark western quarter of the castle. “The gate is unbarred! We will hold this ground and follow when we can! Run!” The choice was agonizing. To leave Kaelan and his men to face the inevitable tide of reinforcements felt like a betrayal. But he saw the fierce, uncompromising command in the old knight’s eyes. Their sacrifice was the price of his and Elara’s freedom. It was a part of the plan, the most bitter part. He grabbed Elara’s hand, his heart a cold, heavy stone in his chest. “Thank you,” he breathed, a hopelessly inadequate farewell. Kaelan just shook his head, a grim smile on his blood-spattered face. “Go give her hell, my prince,” he growled. Alistair did not wait for another command. He turned and ran, pulling Elara with him, melting into the deeper shadows of the castle, leaving the fire and the fight and the dying behind them. They ran through deserted service corridors and across darkened lawns, the sounds of the battle fading, replaced by the sound of their own ragged breathing. Ahead of them, a small postern gate in the massive western wall stood slightly ajar, a dark slash of promise in the unyielding stone. It was freedom, and it was exile, all in one.They burst through the postern gate into the cold, indifferent darkness of the open country, the heavy wooden door swinging shut behind them with a soft, final thud. For a few frantic, heart-pounding moments, they did not stop running, fueled by pure adrenaline and the primal instinct to put distance between themselves and the cage of stone and fire they had just escaped. The roar of the inferno and the distant, sharp clang of steel receded behind them, swallowed by the vast, heathery silence of the Chase. Soon, the only sounds were the frantic rasp of their own breathing, the soft thud of their boots on the damp earth, and the rustle of the wind through the gorse. The cool, clean air of the night was a balm on Alistair's lungs, washing away the acrid smoke and the coppery scent of blood. He held Elara’s hand, not just pulling her along, but drawing a strange strength from her steady, surprisingly resilient presence.

They ran until the lights of the castle were a faint, angry glow on the horizon, a festering wound in the blackness. Alistair, guided by an instinct born of his long, solitary walk, veered away from the open ground and into a more broken, rocky terrain. His body remembered this land, its dips and hollows, its secret places of shelter. He found what he was looking for in the lee of a small, granite-strewn hill: a shallow overhang, barely deep enough to be called a cave, but sheltered from the wind and hidden from the casual eye by a thick curtain of ancient, tangled ivy. It was a humble refuge, a far cry from the perfect quiet of the hermitage, but it was a space beyond the reach of his father's kingdom. He helped Elara inside, the exhaustion of the night’s work finally settling deep into his bones, a leaden weight that made his limbs ache and tremble.

While Elara sank onto the dry, sandy floor of the shelter, her back against the cold stone, Alistair set to work with the quiet, methodical purpose he had learned on the mountain. He gathered dry twigs and fallen branches from a nearby thicket, his movements economical and sure in the darkness. Using his flint and steel, he coaxed a small, smokeless fire to life in the deepest part of the overhang, its flames carefully shielded by a ring of stones. The small blaze pushed back the oppressive darkness, painting their small refuge in warm, dancing colours and casting their faces in light and shadow. The simple act of creating warmth and light in the vast wilderness was a profound statement, a reclamation of control after the chaos of the escape. For a few moments, they simply sat in silence, watching the flames, the shared quiet a stark contrast to the terror and violence of the past hour.

Elara watched him, her face unreadable in the flickering light. He saw that her own hands were scraped and her simple dress was torn at the hem, but she bore herself with a stillness that was both familiar and newly astonishing. She had not panicked, had not faltered. She had moved through the chaos with a quiet, focused determination. When his gaze met hers, she reached into the small satchel she carried and drew out a clean strip of linen and a small vial of herbal salve, supplies she must have kept for just such a purpose. Without a word, she moved closer, took his hand, and began to gently clean a long, shallow cut on his forearm where a splintered piece of wood had grazed him during the fight. Her touch was light and practical, yet it held an intimacy that went deeper than any courtly gesture. It was the touch of a partner, a fellow survivor, acknowledging a shared wound in the aftermath of a battle they had won together.

“They died for us,” Alistair said, the words emerging raw and heavy into the quiet space between them. He stared into the fire, but he did not see the flames. He saw the grim, resolute face of Sir Kaelan, the fierce loyalty in the eyes of his men as they met the charge. The weight of their sacrifice was a physical pressure in his chest, a debt he could never repay. “I led them to their deaths. Kaelan… he knew he wasn't going to walk away from that courtyard.” His voice was thick with a guilt so profound it threatened to drown him, the old shame replaced with a new, far heavier burden. He had saved one person he loved, but he had condemned others who had placed their faith in him.

“They chose,” Elara countered softly, her voice a thread of steel in the darkness. She finished tying the bandage around his arm, her movements deft and sure. “Kaelan did not die for you, Alistair. He died for the hope of you. He chose to fight for the kind of kingdom you might build, not the one your father and my mother are burning down. His was not a death of sacrifice, but an act of faith. To believe he died for nothing would be the real betrayal.” She looked at him, her pale eyes reflecting the firelight, clear and fiercely intelligent. “The man I saw in that tower tonight, the one who fought in the courtyard… that is the man Kaelan placed his faith in. Not the prince who used to sulk when his horse cast a shoe.” Her words were sharp, but they were not a rebuke. They were a challenge, a reminder of the man he had become, and the responsibilities that came with it.

He looked down at his bandaged arm, at her small, capable hands, and then back into her eyes. The guilt was still there, but it was joined now by the fierce, clarifying heat of her words. He had come to save her, but once again, she was saving him, pulling him back from the edge of a different kind of darkness. The immediate future, which had been a terrifying blank space just moments before, began to take on a new, urgent shape. The first part of his journey was over. The second was just beginning. “So what do we do now?” he asked, the question directed as much to himself as to her. “We have no army, no allies but a handful of ghosts. Do we run until we find a country that has never heard of Cannock? Or do we stay and fight for the one we’ve broken?”

Elara drew her knees to her chest, her gaze fixed on the small, defiant fire. “My mother will hunt us. She will see your return not as a claim to the throne, but as a personal insult, a flaw in her perfect design. She will not stop. And your father… a king who has declared his only son dead cannot easily welcome him back. To them, you are more dangerous alive than you ever were.” She paused, letting the grim reality of their situation settle between them. “Running is safety. Staying is a declaration of war. A war we are not equipped to fight.” She fell silent, and in that quiet, Alistair found his answer. He thought of the hermitage, the long, patient work of building something true and solid in a barren landscape. He thought of the fear and discontent he had heard in the voices at the inn. He thought of the men who had died believing in a better Cannock. To run would be to let the fire Isolde had lit consume everything.

“Then we will have to get equipped,” he said, his voice quiet but infused with a new, unshakeable certainty. He looked at Elara, whose own expression was slowly shifting from one of pragmatic analysis to a dawning, shared resolve. The path ahead was impossibly steep, a climb far more treacherous than the high moors. But for the first time, he was not climbing alone. The fire burned low, a single point of defiant light in the vast, sleeping wilderness of the Chase. They were two fugitives, huddled in a shallow cave, with nothing but their wits and the clothes on their backs. But they were together. And in the embers of the old world, they would find a way to forge a new one.The dawn that broke over the Chase was a quiet, indifferent affair, a slow bleed of pearlescent grey into the blackness of the night. It found Alistair already awake, sitting just inside the mouth of their small shelter, the cooled ashes of their fire a small, dark circle on the sandy floor. Sleep had been a shallow, fleeting thing, haunted by the roar of flames and the ghost of a dying man’s face. He had watched the stars wheel overhead, their cold, distant light offering no comfort, only a sense of his own infinitesimal smallness in the face of the task ahead. His body ached with a deep, weary pain, a collection of bruises and scrapes that were the physical ledger of their escape, but his mind, for the first time since leaving the mountain, was utterly and completely still. The frantic energy of the escape had burned away, leaving behind a core of cold, hard resolve.

He rose without a sound and slipped out into the misty morning air, moving with the practiced quiet of a creature of the wilderness. He carried the waterskin and his knife, his senses alert to the subtle language of the land. He found a small, clear spring bubbling up from between moss-covered rocks, its water achingly cold and pure. As he filled the skin, he saw the tracks of a rabbit nearby and, following them with a patience that was now second nature, he found a small warren. With a few deft movements, he set a simple snare made from a length of tough, stripped vine from his bootlace, a skill learned through long, hungry days on his journey to the hermitage. He was not a prince playing at being a hunter; he was a man providing for his own, his actions flowing from a place of deep, practical necessity. Returning to the shelter, he found Elara awake, sitting upright with her back against the stone, her cloak drawn tightly around her. She had not been sleeping, but watching the entrance, her expression one of thoughtful, silent vigilance.

She watched him as he rekindled the fire, his movements efficient and sure, and then skillfully prepared the small rabbit for roasting. The domesticity of the act was jarringly at odds with the memory of the violence in the courtyard, yet it was precisely this practicality that grounded them. They were not just fugitives in a grand drama; they were two hungry people in the wilderness, and their first duty was to the simple, demanding reality of survival. They ate the roasted meat in silence, the simple sustenance a profound comfort. It was Elara who finally broke the quiet, her voice clear and analytical, devoid of the exhaustion that lined her face. “My mother’s first move will be to control the narrative,” she said, her gaze fixed on the small fire as if it were a tactical map. “The fire will be your fault. The dead guards will be your victims. She will use it as an excuse to declare martial law within the castle grounds. It will give her the authority to arrest, question, and remove anyone she suspects of disloyalty. Kaelan’s network, if any of it survived the night, will be systematically dismantled within days.”

Alistair listened, his appreciation for her sharp, strategic mind a growing counterpoint to his own grim guilt. She saw the chessboard, every piece, every potential move, while he was still reeling from the bloody cost of their first gambit. "She will paint me as a monster," he said, echoing her thoughts. "A madman trying to usurp a grieving king." Elara nodded, a grim finality in the movement. "Worse. She will use your known ‘affliction.’ She will say your mind finally broke, that you returned with a band of brigands to murder your own family. The story will be that Kaelan died trying to stop you. She will make a martyr of the very man who gave his life for you. It's a perfect, vicious, and completely believable lie." The cold, calculated cruelty of it took Alistair’s breath away, but it also clarified his purpose with a chilling intensity. They were not just fighting a queen; they were fighting a story.

“Then our first task is to survive long enough to write a different one,” he stated, his voice low and firm. "We cannot stay here. Patrols will be scouring the Chase by midday. They'll search every known shelter, every shepherd’s hut.” He thought back to his own desperate wandering, the mental map of the wilderness he had unwittingly created. “There are places they do not know. On my way to the mountain, I crossed through a part of the heath called the Black Skerries. It’s a maze of ancient peat cuttings and treacherous bog, a place the local folk avoid. They say it’s haunted. In its heart, there is a cluster of granite outcrops, like broken teeth. I took shelter there once. It’s defensible, there is fresh water, and no one in their right mind would look for us there.” He looked at Elara, a silent question in his eyes. It was a miserable, desolate place, a landscape of decay and stagnant water. But it would be safe.

Elara considered his words, her gaze distant. Her expertise was in the politics of the court, the subtle currents of power within stone walls. This new world, a world of peat bogs and survival, was his domain. She was placing her life, her future, in the hands of this changed man, and the trust in her eyes was a weight far heavier than any crown. "A haunted maze sounds like the perfect place for a ghost to hide," she said, a flicker of her old irony returning. "Lead the way, Alistair." The decision made, they moved with a new sense of urgency. Alistair extinguished the fire with meticulous care, scattering the ashes and stones, using a branch to sweep their tracks from the sandy floor of the cave. He erased their presence as completely as the court had tried to erase his. With the rising sun at their backs, they set off, moving deeper into the wild, two solitary figures against the vast, indifferent landscape of the Chase, their destination not a sanctuary, but a new kind of prison, a fortress built of mud and mist.

Their journey to the Black Skerries was a two-day trek through an increasingly desolate and unwelcoming landscape. Alistair moved with a tireless, loping stride, his eyes constantly scanning their surroundings, his ears attuned to every snap of a twig, every cry of a bird. He taught Elara to walk on the balls of her feet to minimize sound, to read the subtle changes in vegetation that signaled treacherous ground, to find the wild sorrel and bitter roots that could supplement their meager diet. She was a quick and uncomplaining student, her sharp mind absorbing the new, harsh lessons of survival with the same intensity she had once applied to her books. Her physical endurance surprised him; the girl who had spent her life in libraries and quiet gardens possessed a core of wiry resilience, a stubborn refusal to be broken that matched his own. Their shared hardship forged a new kind of intimacy between them, a language of small, practical gestures. He would find the driest path through a marsh for her; she would notice the first signs of his own exhaustion and insist they rest, sharing out the last of their water without a word.

They arrived at the edge of the Black Skerries as dusk was painting the sky in bruised shades of purple and orange. The place was even more forbidding than Alistair remembered. It was a vast, sunken mire, pockmarked with black, stagnant pools that reflected the sky like polished obsidian. Twisted, skeletal trees, long dead, clawed at the air, and a thick, clammy mist was already beginning to rise from the ground, muffling all sound and blurring the edges of the world. A profound, eerie silence hung over the bog, a silence that felt older and deeper than the quiet of the high moors. “You were right,” Elara murmured, her voice a hushed whisper as she stood beside him, looking out over the desolate expanse. “No one will follow us in here.” In the centre of the mire, rising like the spine of some great, buried beast, was the cluster of granite tors Alistair had described. It was their island, their fortress in this bleak, watery wasteland.

They found the shelter he remembered, a deep, dry fissure between two of the largest tors, almost completely hidden by a thick growth of hardy, black-leafed ivy. It was larger and more defensible than their first hiding place, with a clear view of the surrounding bog but nearly invisible from any approach. As Alistair set about the familiar tasks of making camp, Elara took on a new role. She cleared a flat stone to serve as a table and, using a piece of charcoal from the fire, began to sketch on a smooth, pale piece of birch bark she had found. She drew a map of the castle from memory, her strokes precise and certain. She marked the guard posts, the patrol routes, the location of Kaelan’s office, the north tower. Then, beside it, she began to make a list. Gregor. Borin. Tam, the stable boy. Then she added another name: Joric. “We are isolated,” she said, her voice quiet but intense as Alistair came to look over her shoulder. “But we are not entirely alone. These are our potential allies. Our first, most critical task is to find out which of them are still alive and which of them can be reached. We need a line to the world, a way to gather information. Without it, we are not a rebellion. We are just two people hiding in a swamp.” Her words were a stark reminder that their survival here was not the end goal, but merely the necessary condition for the true fight to begin. As the last of the light faded and the mist swirled around their rocky island, Alistair looked at the crude map, at the list of names that were their only hope. The hermitage was a lifetime away. His new work, the hard, dangerous work of building a rebellion from nothing, had just begun.The days that followed fell into a harsh, elemental rhythm, dictated not by the bells of Chase House, but by the slow wheeling of the sun across the bruised sky and the relentless creep of the bog’s cold mist. Their fortress of granite teeth, set in the black, watery gums of the Skerries, became a world unto itself. It was a miserable, desolate kingdom, but it was theirs. Alistair, with the tireless energy of a man who had found his purpose in the simple, demanding acts of survival, made it habitable. He deepened their shelter, using his knife and flat stones to create a sleeping platform raised above the damp ground. He discovered a way to collect rainwater, clean and fresh, as it trickled down a specific channel in the rock, and he became a silent, efficient hunter of the bog’s meager fauna—the tough marsh hares, the occasional unwary moorhen. His life, once a pageant of meaningless duties, was now stripped to its essential, vital core: find food, maintain shelter, keep the fire alive, protect his queen of a forsaken kingdom.

While Alistair wrestled with the physical reality of their existence, Elara waged a war on a different front. She was the cartographer of their nascent rebellion, the architect of a war that existed, for now, only on pieces of scavenged bark. Her days were spent in intense, focused observation and thought. She would sit for hours at the mouth of their shelter, her gaze fixed on the shifting mists, but her mind was miles away, within the stone walls of the castle. She interrogated Alistair, drawing from him every detail of his own journey, every nuance of the land he had crossed. She mapped his memories, adding the shepherd’s approximate location, the village of Oakhaven, and the network of forgotten paths to her growing repository of knowledge. Her collection of bark scrolls, covered in her neat, precise script, became their most precious possession, a fragile library of hope in the heart of a wasteland. They worked in a tandem of near-perfect, unspoken understanding, a partnership of mind and body, strategy and sinew.

But as the days bled into a week, and then another, a new kind of enemy began to creep in with the evening mist: the corrosive power of silence. Not the restorative silence of the hermitage, but a heavy, isolating quiet, pregnant with uncertainty. Every morning they awoke to the same grim landscape, every evening they fell asleep to the same profound lack of news. The world beyond their bog might as well have ceased to exist. They did not know if Kaelan’s sacrifice had been in vain, if Gregor and Borin were dead or in chains, if Joric had been found, or if young Tam had paid the ultimate price for his loyalty. The waiting was a form of slow torture, a gnawing anxiety that threatened to unravel the edges of their hard-won resolve. Alistair felt the old restlessness stir, the memory of his own helpless confinement in the castle, a feeling he now saw reflected, for the first time, in Elara’s tightly controlled posture.

The breaking point came on a day of relentless, weeping drizzle that turned their small world a uniform, miserable grey. Elara had been staring at her maps for hours, her knuckles white where she gripped her charcoal stylus. Finally, she threw the piece of bark down onto the stone with a sharp, uncharacteristic snap of frustration. “This is useless,” she said, her voice a low, furious tremor that cut through the sound of the rain. “We sit here drawing maps of a country we cannot reach. We list the names of men who are likely already dead. This isn't a strategy, Alistair. It's a eulogy. We are composing a very thoughtful history of a failed rebellion that hasn’t even begun. My mother is not waiting. She is acting. She is cutting the throat of our kingdom with a surgeon’s precision while we sit here learning how to cook a rabbit.” The outburst was shocking, a crack in the flawless armour of her composure, revealing the fierce, desperate intelligence raging within.

Alistair stopped his work, which had been the patient waterproofing of their cloaks with a concoction of rendered animal fat and pine resin. He looked at her, seeing not the strategist, but the frightened, trapped girl from the tower, her cage simply made larger. He did not offer empty reassurances. He met her fury with the calm, steady weight of his own hard-earned experience. “You are right,” he said, his voice quiet but resonant. “We cannot fight her war from here. We need to fight our own.” He picked up a smooth, wet stone from the ground, turning it over and over in his palm, the gesture now an unconscious habit of thought. “When I was walking to the mountain, I was a ghost. I had no name, no money to speak of, no purpose but to keep moving. I would have died if not for the people the castle doesn't see. The shepherd I told you of, he saw a man in need, not a prince in disgrace. There are others like him. Trappers, tinkers, poachers, charcoal-burners. They move through the Chase like water, following their own paths, their own laws. They pay taxes to the King, but their loyalty is to the land, and to each other. They are invisible to your mother, beneath her notice. And that makes them the most powerful allies we could possibly have.”

The fury in Elara’s eyes slowly gave way to a dawning, sharp-edged comprehension. Her mind, freed from the dead-end of their current predicament, seized upon the new possibility with its customary brilliance. “A network of ghosts,” she whispered, the idea taking root. “They know the hidden ways. They hear the whispers from the villages. They would know if a garrison was moved, or if a tax collector went missing. They are the eyes and ears we lack.” She looked at him, her expression a mixture of awe and a renewed, formidable determination. “But how do we reach them? We cannot simply walk up to a poacher and ask him to commit treason.”

Alistair felt a surge of purpose, a sense that the two disparate parts of his life, the wanderer and the prince, were finally merging into a coherent whole. “No,” he agreed. “But we can open a dialogue. For the last week, I’ve seen signs of a trapper working the southern edge of the Skerries. He has a line of snares, and he checks them every three or four days. He is skilled, but he is poor—his snares are old wire. We will not approach him. We will leave him a gift. A message only someone like him would understand.” He walked to the corner of the shelter where he kept his small store of supplies. He took the length of high-quality, supple snare wire he had salvaged from one of the dead guards in the tower, and a perfectly tanned rabbit pelt, the fur soft and unblemished. “We will leave these for him, placed on one of his own traps. It is a gift of respect from one hunter to another. It says, 'I am here. I am skilled. I am not your enemy.' It will make him curious. And a curious man is a man you can eventually talk to.”

The plan was a whisper in the dark, a fragile beginning, but it was a plan of action. The oppressive weight of their inaction lifted, replaced by the sharp, clean thrill of a calculated risk. That evening, as the rain finally ceased and a watery moon broke through the clouds, Alistair prepared to leave the sanctuary of their island for the first time. He wrapped the pelt and the coil of wire in an oilskin cloth and tucked it inside his tunic. He checked the edge on his knife and slung the waterskin over his shoulder. Elara stood at the entrance of the shelter, her arms wrapped around herself, watching him. The firelight cast long, dancing shadows, making the world outside their small circle of light seem vast and threatening. He was her only guard, her only companion, and he was about to walk out into the haunted darkness, deliberately seeking contact with the unknown. “Be careful, Alistair,” she said, her voice losing its strategic edge, becoming once again the soft, quiet whisper of the girl in the portrait gallery. He met her worried gaze and gave a slow, confident nod. “I am not a prince walking on a lawn anymore, Elara,” he said softly. “The bogs and the shadows… they are my world now. This is my court.” And with that, he turned and melted into the mist-shrouded labyrinth of the Black Skerries, a ghost on a mission to find other ghosts.
