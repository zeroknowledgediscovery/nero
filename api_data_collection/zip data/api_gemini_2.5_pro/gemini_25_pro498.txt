The rain wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a cinematic, street-cleansing torrent that promised a fresh start. It was Wolverhampton rain. A fine, persistent drizzle that hung in the air like a sigh, seeping into the brickwork of the terraced houses and turning the sky the colour of a forgotten cup of tea. It was a weather of quiet resignation, and it suited Alex’s mood perfectly. He sat on the top deck of the number 5 bus, watching a smeared, water-colour version of the city slide by, his reflection a pale ghost superimposed over the grey concrete of the Ring Road.

Another Tuesday. Another shift at the call centre, his voice slowly being eroded by the endless script, his soul being nibbled away by the feigned enthusiasm. “And how would you rate the service I’ve provided you today on a scale of one to five, with five being ‘exceptionally helpful’?” He’d said it so many times the words had lost all meaning, becoming a mantra of his own personal, beige-coloured hell. His thumb moved of its own accord, scrolling, scrolling, a nervous twitch of the modern soul. A blizzard of curated lives, angry headlines, and videos of cats falling off things. Numbness was the goal. Apathy, a shield.

Then he saw it. Not a headline, but a tremor in the digital ether. A trending topic, bubbling up with unnatural speed: #WolvesBlight. He frowned, his thumb pausing. He tapped. The first post was a grainy video, poorly lit, showing what looked like the towpath of a canal. A dark, oily sheen coated the water, not like petrol, but thicker, like tar. The video zoomed in on the brickwork of a bridge, where a black, creeping mould, webbed with something that glittered sickly in the phone’s torchlight, seemed to be eating a-way at the mortar. The caption read: “Canal blight down by the old works. Smells of sulphur. Police are saying it’s nothing but it’s spreading FAST.”

Alex snorted. Some kid with a filter and too much time on his hands. He scrolled down. More videos. Different angles. The same black, creeping substance. Then came the stories. A dog had fallen in and come out whimpering, its fur matted and cold. A woman claimed the air around it made her dizzy, that she’d heard a low humming sound. A local historian, a man Alex had never heard of, was being quoted in hastily written blog posts, talking about an “ancient industrial curse” woken by new developments. It was absurd. It was the kind of nonsense that flared up for an afternoon and was gone by teatime.

Except it wasn’t going. By the time the bus wheezed to his stop in Penn, his feed was completely saturated. It was on the local news sites now, framed with cautious, non-committal language. “Authorities are investigating an ‘unidentified substance’…” But the public comments below were a wildfire of panic. “It’s a chemical leak from the old factories!” “It’s a terror attack, they’re poisoning the water!” “My cousin’s mate is a copper and he said they’re evacuating the whole area!” Alex knew for a fact they weren’t. He could almost see the canal from his bedroom window. He felt a strange, cold knot tighten in his stomach. The panic felt… synthetic. Too quick. Too uniform.

His house was like a thousand others in the area, a brick-faced terrace with a small, tidy front garden that was his mum’s pride and joy. The smell of mince and onions hit him as soon as he opened the door, a smell so familiar it was practically a part of his DNA.

“You’re late,” his mum, Sandra, said without looking up from the stove. Her focus was absolute. A pan of peas bubbled aggressively. “Your tea’s on the table. Don’t let it get cold.”

“Bus was packed,” he muttered, dropping his bag by the door. He slumped into a chair at the small kitchen table. The plate was already there, a perfect dome of mince, a wall of mashed potato holding back a gravy sea, and a small, green mountain of peas. For his mum, the world could be ending, but you’d face it on a full stomach.

“There’s some funny stuff on the internet,” he said, prodding the mince with his fork. “About the canal.”

Sandra tutted, a sound she had perfected over forty years of mild-to-moderate exasperation. “Oh, I’ve seen it. Carol from next door was in a right state. Said her grandkids were supposed to be feeding the ducks tomorrow and now she thinks they’ll grow a second head. Hysterical, the lot of them. It’s probably just some kids chucking paint about.” She said it with conviction, but as she brought her own plate to the table, he saw her glance nervously towards the window. The lie, or whatever it was, was seeping under the doors. It had reached his mum. It had made her glance at a window. That was more terrifying than a thousand panicked tweets.

“It just feels weird,” Alex said, quieter now. “How fast it’s spreading. The story, I mean.”

“Everything’s fast now, our Al,” she said, finally sitting. “A lie gets halfway round the world before the truth has got its boots on. Your nan used to say that.”

His nan. The thought of her landed in his mind with a sudden, unexpected weight. His nan, with her tower block flat and her view of the entire city. His nan, with her strange sayings and her stories about their family that everyone else treated as a gentle, harmless madness. The stories of a line of Mercian princes, not of castles and crowns, but of iron and coal and the soul of the Black Country. A royal line that had dwindled to a woman who collected porcelain birds and a grandson who reset passwords for a living.

“Might pop and see Nan later,” he said, the decision forming even as he spoke.

His mum looked at him, a real look this time, her fork halfway to her mouth. She saw something in his face, a tension that wasn't usually there. “Alright,” she said, her voice softening. “See if she needs any biscuits. I think she’s running low on digestives.”

The lift in his nan’s block smelled of stale smoke and damp dog. It groaned its way to the twelfth floor, the mechanics sounding as tired as Alex felt. But when the doors opened, the air was different. Her corridor was quiet, clean. He knocked on her door, 2B, and heard the scuffle of slippers, the rattling of a chain.

The door opened a crack. An eye, bright and bird-like, peered out. “Alex?”

“Hiya, Nan.”

The chain was undone, and the door swung wide. Elara, his grandmother, was a tiny woman, engulfed in a pink cardigan that had seen better decades. Her white hair was a thin, flyaway halo, but her eyes were sharp, missing nothing.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost,” she said, ushering him in. “Or you’ve been reading the news, which is much the same thing these days.”

Her flat was a sanctuary of meticulously arranged clutter. Doilies on every surface, the aforementioned porcelain birds perched on the mantelpiece, and photos. So many photos. Alex as a gap-toothed kid on a tricycle. His dad, young and smiling, before he’d decided family life wasn't for him. And older photos, sepia-toned, of faces he didn't know, stern-looking men with formidable moustaches and women in high-collared dresses. His ancestors. The “princes.”

“Mum said you might be low on digestives,” he said, handing her the packet.

“Your mother is a saint and a worrier,” Elara said, taking them and placing them on the kitchen counter. “But that’s not why you’re here, is it, my love? You’ve got that look. The one you get when the world stops making sense.”

She led him into the living room. The main feature of the room was the window, a huge pane of glass that offered a panoramic view of Wolverhampton. The city was spread out below them, a tapestry of sodium-orange streetlights and the dark, sleeping shapes of buildings. The rain had eased, and the lights glittered like scattered jewels. It was, from up here, almost beautiful.

“It’s the canal,” he said, not sure where to start. “This story. The blight.”

His nan didn’t laugh. She didn’t tut like his mum. She just nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the view. She walked over to the window, her tiny frame silhouetted against the urban sprawl.

“It’s started, then,” she whispered, and the words were so quiet, so filled with a deep, ancient dread, that a chill traced its way down Alex’s spine.

“Started? What’s started? Nan, it’s just a story. It’s a hoax.”

She turned to face him, and her eyes, usually so full of twinkly mischief, were as serious as he’d ever seen them. “A story, Alex? Yes. Of course it’s a story. That’s the whole point. That’s his weapon.”

“His? Whose weapon?” This was it. He was on the threshold of the family joke, the gentle eccentricity, but it didn’t feel funny anymore.

“You’ve always thought my tales were just… ramblings, haven’t you? A bit of nonsense to make a dreary world more interesting.” She smiled, a sad, knowing little smile. “I don’t blame you. It’s a lot to carry. But the stories are true. All of them. Our line. We’re not princes of land and titles, Alex. We’re keepers of the narrative. We’re anchors for the truth in a world that’s becoming… untethered.”

He just stared at her. He wanted to say something, to be cynical, to make a joke. But the words wouldn’t come. The cold knot in his stomach was now a block of ice. The sincerity in her voice was absolute.

“There are others,” she said, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. “Other lines. Not all of them are like us. There is one, the Whispering Prince, who was born with a twisted gift. Where our blood resonates with what’s true, his thrives on the lie. He can weave a story, a nasty, poisonous little story, and if he’s clever, if he feeds it just right, it can… bleed into the real. It can take root. He finds the cracks in a community, the little fears and anxieties, and he whispers his poison into them until the crack becomes a chasm.”

Alex’s mind was reeling, trying to process the impossible. A prince of lies. A magic based on fake news. It was the most insane and yet, horribly, the most believable thing he had ever heard. The #WolvesBlight. It wasn’t a chemical spill. It was a story. A story that was coming true, down there in the dark water.

“His name is Lyron,” Elara said, the name tasting like ash in her mouth. “And his power is growing. He’s been practicing, getting stronger. Little things at first, a rumour that ruins a man’s reputation, a whisper that closes a beloved shop. But this… this is different. This is bigger. He’s not just sowing discord. He’s poisoning the place itself. Our place.”

She shuffled over to a small, dark wooden chest by the fireplace. She lifted the lid, and the scent of cedarwood and old paper filled the air. She rummaged inside, past bundles of letters tied with ribbon and what looked like old maps, before her hand closed around something.

She turned back to him, her hand outstretched. In her palm lay a ring. It wasn't gold or ostentatious. It was made of a dull, heavy-looking silver, blackened with age. The design was a simple, thick band, its face carved with a strange, interlocking knot-work design that seemed to pulse in the low light. It was a snarling wolf’s head, its form woven from the roots of a tree. The sigil of the Mercian Kings. The sigil of the Prince of Wolverhampton.

“Your great-grandfather wore this,” she said. “And his father before him. It doesn’t give you power, Alex. Not like Lyron’s. It’s not a weapon. It’s an amplifier. It attunes you. It helps you hear the truth beneath the noise. It helps you see the seams of the lie.”

Alex stared at the ring, then at his own hands – hands that typed on a keyboard and held plastic-wrapped sandwiches. They were not the hands of a prince. He was Alex, from Penn. He liked video games and hated his job. He was not destined to save the world. He was destined to maybe, one day, afford a deposit on a flat.

“Nan, I… I can’t.”

“You can,” she said, her voice fierce, cutting through his disbelief. “Because you have to. Because he has chosen our home as his new canvas. And if we let his story take hold, if we let this blight fester, it won’t just be the canal. He will rewrite this city into a place of fear and decay. He will break its heart. And you, Alex, are its prince. It’s time you remembered what that means.” She took his hand, her own one surprisingly strong, and pressed the cold, heavy metal into his palm. It felt less like a gift and more like a sentence.The weight of the ring was absurd. It was like holding a small stone, dense with a history he couldn’t comprehend. The snarling wolf’s head, worn smooth by generations of touch, seemed to dig into his palm. Prince. The word echoed in the quiet flat, a ridiculous, theatrical title that belonged in a fantasy novel, not a twelfth-floor flat overlooking a retail park. He wanted to laugh, to drop the ring on the doily-covered coffee table and tell his nan she’d been reading too many strange books. But he couldn’t. The desperate sincerity in her eyes held him captive, and the cold knot of dread in his gut was now a churning vortex of impossibility.

"Nan, this is… crazy," he managed, his voice a strained whisper. "We're not... there are no princes in Penn. I work in a call centre. My greatest achievement this week was up-selling a pensioner to a premium broadband package she didn't need. That's not a prince. That's just... a bloke." He opened his hand, looking at the ring as if it were a venomous insect. "It's a cool story. It's a better story than my actual life, but it's not real."

Elara’s expression didn’t falter. She didn't look offended or disappointed, just tired, as if this was a hurdle she had expected. “What is real, Alex? Is the job real? The script you read? The number on your bank statement? Or is the feeling in your gut real? The feeling you had on the bus, that something was wrong. That the panic was… manufactured. You felt it, didn't you? Before I said a word. You felt the lie. That’s our blood, Alex. That’s the inheritance. Not castles, not land. A tuning fork for the truth. The ring just helps you hear the note.”

His thumb, that twitchy, modern soul, found his phone in his pocket. A reflex. A retreat to the familiar stream of nonsense. He pulled it out, the screen lighting up his face. The #WolvesBlight hashtag was still there, now accompanied by a stark red ‘BREAKING’ banner from a national news outlet. His thumb hovered over the screen. This was his world. Feeds and notifications. Concrete. Verifiable, even when it was fake. He looked from the phone to the ring in his other hand. It was a choice between two kinds of madness. One he understood, and one he desperately didn't. With a surge of something – frustration, despair, a sliver of terrified curiosity – he pushed the ring onto the third finger of his right hand. It slid on as if it were made for him, the cold metal instantly, unnervingly, warming to his skin.

For a moment, nothing happened. The flat was still the flat. The city lights were still the city lights. He felt a wave of relief mixed with foolishness. See? Just a ring. A piece of old family tat. He looked down at his phone again, at the trending topic, and that’s when the world tilted. The text on the screen seemed to… shimmer. The words of the panicked comments, the breathless news reports, they were no longer just pixels. Beneath them, visible like a watermark or a heat-haze, he saw something else. He saw threads, thin and greasy, like strands of oily cobweb, linking the posts. They all emanated from a single, dark point, a node of pure fabrication somewhere deep in the digital noise. The fear he read in the comments no longer felt genuine; it felt puppeteered, each exclamation mark, each capitalised shout of outrage, pulled by one of these greasy threads. He could perceive the *intent* behind the words, the cloying, sickly glee of the person weaving the narrative. It was a feeling, a taste in the back of his throat like sulphur and burnt sugar.

He gasped, dropping the phone onto the sofa as if it had burned him. He looked up at the window, at the city spread below. It wasn't just a pattern of lights anymore. He could see the narratives. He could see the story of the city as a living, breathing thing. He saw the threads of community, golden and warm, connecting houses and streets. He saw the dull, grey lines of routine, like the path his bus took every day. And now, snaking out from the dark, serpentine line of the canal, he saw a new thread. A black, cancerous tendril, pulsing with a malevolent, storytelling energy. It wasn't just blight on the water; it was a blight on the very idea of the place, a story of decay and poison being actively, maliciously told. And it was working. He could see the golden threads of community near the canal fraying, turning brittle and grey under the onslaught of the black narrative.

“I see it,” he breathed, turning to his nan, his eyes wide with a terror that was finally, horribly real. “I can see it. The lies.”

Elara nodded, a deep sadness in her eyes. “It’s a heavy burden, to see the weave. But seeing is the first step to mending.” She pointed a trembling finger towards the dark line of the canal in the distance. “He’s there. Not Lyron himself, not yet. He’s too cautious for that. But his story is. It’s anchored to a place, just as our truth is. It’s latched onto the old canal works, a place of memory and decay. A place with its own sad stories he can twist.”

“What am I supposed to do?” Alex’s voice cracked. “Go down there? Make a blog post saying it’s all a magic lie? They’ll lock me up. I’m not a prince, I’m not a warrior. I sell broadband packages.”

“You don’t fight a story with a sword, Alex. You fight it with a better one. A truer one,” she said, her voice gaining a sliver of its old strength. “You are a Prince of this place. Your blood remembers its real stories. The stories of the iron, the coal, the graft. The story of its resilience. The story of the people who built it and live in it and love it, even when it’s grey and drizzling. That’s the truth. And the truth is always, always stronger than the lie. But it needs a voice. You need to go to the source, to the place where his lie has taken root, and you need to… remind it of itself.”

He looked down at his hands. The ring felt like it was fused to his finger, a part of him now. The weight of it was no longer just metal; it was the weight of his city, of his ancestors, of the stories he’d dismissed as ramblings. He thought of the canal, of the feigned panic, of the creeping black mould he’d seen in the video. It wasn’t just a hoax anymore. It was an invasion. A quiet, insidious invasion of his home, not with armies, but with whispers. And as he stood there, his call-centre voice and his beige-coloured life felt a million miles away. A different kind of purpose, terrifying and vast, was settling over him. He was still Alex. But maybe Alex was more than he thought.

“The old works,” he said, his voice steadier than he expected. “Down by the junction.” He looked from his nan’s determined face to the sprawling, wounded city outside the window. The thought of going there, into the heart of the creeping lie, sent a fresh wave of fear through him. But beneath the fear, something else was stirring. A stubborn, grit-your-teeth resolve that he hadn’t felt in years. It was the same feeling that made you get on the bus in the rain, that made you clock in for another shift, that made you keep going. It was a Wolverhampton feeling. He slipped his phone back into his pocket, the greasy threads of the lie still a faint, sickening overlay in his perception. “Alright,” he said, the word a vow. “Alright. I’ll go.”The goodbye was quiet. Elara simply took his hand, the one without the ring, and squeezed it. Her skin was like paper, but her grip was firm, a final, silent transfer of conviction. She didn’t wish him luck or tell him to be careful; those were words for a world where the dangers were simple and physical. Instead, she just looked at him, her bird-bright eyes filled with a terrifying, absolute belief. "Remember its name," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "Remember what it’s made of. Iron and sweat and song. That is its truth." He nodded, the words lodging themselves somewhere deep inside him, a counter-spell to the lies he could now see so clearly.

He didn't take the bus. The thought of being in a confined space, watching the greasy tendrils of Lyron's story leap from phone to phone, from whispered conversation to worried glance, was more than he could bear. He walked. The drizzle had returned, settling over the city streets like a shroud, but it felt different now. With the ring on his finger, the world was a layered, complex text he was only just beginning to read. He saw the faint, golden glow of a shared joke between two women huddled in a doorway. He saw the weary, grey thread of a man walking home from a sixteen-hour shift, a line of pure, dogged perseverance. These were the city’s authentic stories, the tiny, countless narratives that formed its real soul. And weaving through them, stark and invasive, was the pulsing, black network of the Blight. It fed on anxiety, thriving in the spaces where worry overshadowed reason. He saw it flicker in the corner of a newsagent’s window, where the headline of the local paper screamed about the ‘Canal Crisis’. The lie was everywhere.

As he got closer to the canal junction, the air grew thick and cold, the ordinary city smells of traffic fumes and damp pavement giving way to something else. It was the scent from the video, a chemical tang of sulphur overlaid with a strange, cloying sweetness, like rotting flowers. It was the smell of a story that knew it was a lie, a scent of corruption. The background hum of the city, a constant in his life, faded away, replaced by the low, dissonant thrumming the woman on the internet had described. It wasn't a sound his ears could properly place; it was a vibration he felt in his teeth, a pressure behind his eyes. It was the sound of a wrong note being held indefinitely, straining the fabric of the world.

He found the towpath easily. There was a flimsy police cordon, a single car parked nearby with its wipers on, but no officers in sight. They were treating it like a prank, a low-priority chemical spill. They couldn't see the real danger. Alex slipped under the tape, his heart hammering against his ribs. The scene was far worse than the grainy phone videos. The water was a sheet of viscous, light-devouring black, a void where reflections should be. It didn't ripple; it seemed to swell, thick and malevolent. But the true horror was on the brickwork of the bridge. The creeping mould wasn't just on the surface; it was *consuming* it. The familiar, rough texture of the Victorian bricks was being smoothed over, erased, replaced by a featureless, tar-like substance. And in it, the sickly, glittering fragments swirled like trapped data, a digital poison made physical. This was not decay; it was deletion.

He followed the hum, which grew louder, more insistent, as he walked under the arch of the bridge. The greasy threads of the lie he could perceive with the ring were no longer a subtle watermark; here, they were as thick as ropes, all converging on a single point. It was a large, iron mooring ring, set into the oldest part of the wall, its surface almost entirely consumed by the black blight. This was the anchor. The point where Lyron had hooked his story into the physical world, choosing a symbol of connection and stability to corrupt into a source of poison. The air around it was freezing, and the humming drilled into his skull. As he drew closer, whispers slithered into his mind, not in his nan's voice, but his own. The voice of his own doubt, amplified and weaponised. *What are you doing here, Alex? You’re going to get yourself killed over a fairy tale. You’re a fraud. A call centre drone playing at being a hero. This place is already dead. Let it rot.*

He flinched, the words hitting him with the force of a physical blow. This was part of the story, he realised. The narrative of futility. Of apathy. The beige-coloured hell wasn't just his job; it was the weapon being used against his city. He gritted his teeth, the stubborn Wolverhampton feeling rising in him like bile. He reached out a trembling hand and pressed his fingers against the cold, blighted iron of the mooring ring. The moment he made contact, the humming shrieked, and an agony of despair flooded him. He saw his life, not as he’d lived it, but through the lens of the lie: a meaningless sequence of failures, a slow slide into lonely obscurity. He saw the city as a forgotten relic, a joke, its industrial past a story of pointless labour and inevitable decline.

"No," he gasped, his knuckles white against the iron. He closed his eyes, forcing the poisonous narrative out. He had to tell a truer story. But he had no grand epics. He had no songs of kings. He had mince and onions. He had the smell of his mum's kitchen. He had the view from his nan’s window, the city lights like scattered jewels. He had the memory of kicking a football against a garage wall until it got dark. The sound of the crowd at the Molineux, a single, hopeful roar. He pushed these things, these small, mundane, intensely *real* things, into the ring. *Iron and sweat and song,* his nan had said. He thought of the men who had laid these bricks, their hands raw, their backs aching. He thought of the iron in the ring, smelted in the Black Country's fires. He thought of the songs sung in the pubs and factories, stories of ordinary lives lived with a quiet, unyielding strength. He wasn't telling a story. He was *remembering* one.

He focused it all, a lifetime of small, insignificant truths, and pushed it through the ring like an electric current. A pulse of warmth, brilliant and golden, spread from his fingers. The blighted iron beneath his hand sizzled, not with heat, but with a sound like static being tuned out. The soul-crushing hum faltered, breaking into discordant fragments. The blackness *recoiled*. It shrank back from his hand, revealing a patch of rust-red, pitted iron. For a single, breathtaking second, he saw the mooring ring as it truly was, a testament to a hundred and fifty years of resilience, of holding fast. Then the world slammed back into him. A wave of exhaustion so profound it buckled his knees. His head pounded, and the whispers of doubt rushed back in to fill the silence, though they were weaker now, more distant.

He stumbled back, gasping for air, his body trembling with the effort. He looked at his hand, then at the ring. It was just a piece of metal again, cool against his skin. He looked at the mooring ring. The black, creeping blight was already oozing back over the patch he had cleared, sluggishly, but with a relentless certainty. It was an impossibly slow, venomous tide. He hadn't won. He had just proven it could be fought. He had landed a single, defiant blow against the encroaching dark. He turned and scrambled away from the bridge, back towards the thin police tape and the world that didn't know it was at war. The drizzle on his face felt real, a clean, honest sensation against his skin. He was still Alex, from Penn. But now he had a new job, one without a script. And the first shift was over.The walk home was a strange, dislocated journey through a city that was both intimately familiar and terrifyingly new. The sodium lights of the streetlamps cast their usual orange glow, but now Alex saw them as weak fortifications against a tide of perceptual static. He could feel the lie of the Blight as a faint, sour note in the air, a background radiation of wrongness that no one else seemed to notice. A couple walking their dog, a teenager on an e-scooter, a woman unloading shopping from her car – they were all living in a different reality, one where the biggest worry was the price of milk or what to watch on television. He was an observer in his own life, a ghost haunting the streets of his hometown, burdened by a secret that felt heavier than the damp air in his lungs.

He let himself in as quietly as he could, but the scrape of the key in the lock was enough. The hall light flicked on, and his mum stood there, a tea towel in her hand and a frown etched onto her face. Her expression shifted instantly from mild annoyance to sharp concern. He knew he must look a state; his jeans were damp and muddy from where he’d stumbled, his face was the colour of ash, and an exhaustion deeper than any double shift had carved new lines around his eyes. He saw her, for a fleeting second, not just as his mum, but as an anchor of solid, uncomplicated truth in a world that had become a shimmering, deceptive haze.

“Al? My God, you look like you’ve been dug up. What happened to you?” She was already moving towards him, her worry a tangible force. “Are you ill? Did something happen?”

He couldn't tell her that he’d been fighting a sentient narrative with the power of memory and a magic ring. The absurdity of it would break the simple, precious reality of this hallway. He had to lie, and the irony was a bitter pill. “No, I’m fine, Mum. Just… slipped. Down by the path near the park. Made me feel a bit sick, that’s all. Just need a shower.” The words felt like gravel in his mouth, another thread of falsehood added to the world, even if it was for a good reason. Sandra’s frown didn't disappear, but it softened with maternal practicality. She herded him towards the stairs, her fussing a comforting barrage of instructions about hot water, clean towels, and the restorative power of a strong cup of tea, which would be waiting for him whether he liked it or not.

Later, sitting on the edge of his bed with a towel around his shoulders, the steam from the mug of tea ghosting around his face, he felt the chasm between his two lives yawn wide. Downstairs, the television was on, the familiar theme tune of a quiz show a dispatch from a world of knowable facts and easy answers. Here, in the quiet of his room, the humming in his teeth had finally subsided, but a residue remained. He could still feel the echo of the fight, the exhilarating, terrifying moment when the golden warmth of his city’s truth had pulsed from his fingers. It had been the most real thing he had ever experienced, and it had left him feeling hollowed out, a battery drained to zero. He had to know if it had made any difference. With a hand that still felt unsteady, he picked up his phone.

The screen glowed, a portal back to the battlefield. The #WolvesBlight hashtag was still trending, but the flavour of it had changed. With the ring on his finger, he could perceive the shift in the underlying structure of the lie. The initial, chaotic blizzard of panic had coalesced. The greasy threads of Lyron's narrative were no longer spreading wildly; they were being woven into a more complex, more insidious pattern. The story was evolving. He saw a news article from a national website, one known for its aggressive, populist stance. It wasn't about a mysterious blight anymore. The headline read: "DECADES OF NEGLECT: WOLVERHAMPTON COUNCIL’S TOXIC LEGACY POISONS CANALS AS WHISTLEBLOWER FEARS COVER-UP."

He scrolled, his blood running cold. The lie had mutated. Lyron wasn't just telling a horror story now; he was crafting a plausible, cynical narrative of civic failure. The frantic posts about monsters and curses were being buried under a wave of angry, targeted accusations. Comments blamed the council, blamed old industry, blamed the city itself. The fear was being channelled into blame, the community’s golden threads of trust being systematically snipped and re-tied into knots of resentment and suspicion. Lyron had taken Alex’s small act of defiance, his pushback against the supernatural horror, and used it. He had pivoted, turning the unexplainable into the political, a far more potent and believable poison. He was turning the city against its own heart.

The realisation landed with crushing weight. This wasn’t a single battle he could win; it was a war of attrition. For every truth he could find to mend the world, Lyron could weave a dozen more convincing lies to tear it apart. The sheer, grinding effort of what lay ahead stretched out before him, an endless series of shifts in a war nobody else could see. The quiet despair of his call-centre job suddenly seemed like a warm, safe blanket. He felt an overwhelming urge to take off the ring, to shut his eyes, and to retreat back into the comfortable numbness of his beige-coloured hell. But he couldn't. He couldn't unsee the greasy threads. He couldn't unknow that his home was under attack.

He threw on a clean t-shirt and a hoodie, the exhaustion a physical cloak around his shoulders. He went downstairs, placing the empty mug on the kitchen counter. His mum was on the sofa, engrossed in the quiz show. "Just popping back to Nan's," he said, his voice flat. "Forgot to ask her about something." Sandra turned, her brow furrowed with concern. She opened her mouth to protest, to tell him he should be in bed, but something in his expression stopped her. She saw a resolve there, a brittle hardness that hadn't existed that morning. "Alright, Al," she said, her voice soft with an unspoken question. "Don't be long. It's a bad night."

The lift ride was an ascent into a different state of being. He wasn't the confused grandson from earlier. He was a soldier, returning from a skirmish, seeking new orders. Elara opened the door before he could knock, as if she had been waiting just behind it. Her gaze swept over him, and a flicker of something – pride, pain, understanding – crossed her face. She knew. She simply stood aside and let him in, the scent of old paper and lavender a welcome balm after the sulphur of the canal.

He didn't sit down. He stood in the middle of her living room, the city lights a silent audience behind him, and told her everything. He spoke of the viscous water and the consuming mould, the iron ring that served as the lie's anchor, and the disembodied whispers of his own amplified self-doubt. He described the feeling of pushing back, of channelling the small, mundane truths of his life and his city through the ring. And then, his voice cracking with frustration, he told her how it hadn't been enough, how the lie had simply changed its shape, twisting itself into a story of blame and civic decay.

Elara listened without interruption, her small frame radiating an intense, focused stillness. When he finished, the silence in the room was heavy with unspoken history. "You didn't fail, Alex," she said finally, her voice firm. "You learned the first rule of this war. A lie is a blunt instrument. It wants to smash and conquer. But truth is a living thing. It must be tended, remembered, and spoken aloud. You did that. You tended the truth in that one small place. But you cannot be the city's only gardener."

She moved towards the old wooden chest by the fireplace, her movements precise. This time, she didn’t rummage. She lifted the lid and withdrew a thick, leather-bound volume that looked like an old business ledger. She placed it on the coffee table with a soft, definitive thud. “Our line are Keepers of the narrative, the heart-story. But we are not the only ones who guard the city’s soul. Lyron knows this. His new lie is not random. By blaming the council, by inventing a 'whistleblower' and a 'cover-up', he is launching a targeted attack. He is aiming his poison at the city's memory.”

She tapped the cover of the ledger. "There are others who keep the truth, even if they don't know it. The Curator, who protects its artifacts. The Musician, who holds its rhythm. And the Chronicler, who guards its documented history. Lyron’s new story is an assault on the Chronicler’s domain." She looked up, her eyes pinning him in place. "He will try to anchor this new lie in the place where the city's records are kept. The place where paper and ink hold the facts that can disprove his fiction. He's going after the Archives." Her finger traced a line on the dusty cover of the ledger, as if drawing a map of the battlefield. "The old Molineux Hotel. If he can corrupt that place, if he can weave a story that the city's history is itself a lie, then there will be no foundation left to stand on. His narratives will have nothing to contradict them. He will have captured its mind, and the heart will surely follow."Alex stared at the heavy leather ledger on the coffee table. The Curator. The Musician. The Chronicler. It sounded like a fantasy guild, not a defence against a metaphysical attack on a post-industrial city in the Midlands. The Molineux Hotel. He knew the building, a grand but faded red-brick and terracotta structure that stood in the shadow of the football stadium. He’d walked past it a thousand times, vaguely aware that it housed the City Archives, but he'd never once considered going inside. It was a place of the past, filled with dusty things that had no bearing on his life of scrolling feeds and answering calls. Now, his nan was telling him it was the next front line.

“The Archives?” he said, the words feeling clumsy and inadequate. “What am I meant to do? Stand outside and tell true stories at the building? Nan, it’ll be locked up for the night.”

Elara’s gaze was unyielding. “Lyron’s lie is not bound by opening hours. It will seek the path of least resistance. It will seep through the cracks, drawn to the symbolic heart of its target. But the building itself has a story. It has defences of its own, if you know how to listen.” She ran a frail finger down a column of handwritten names in the ledger. “The Chronicler… the line is old. They are not like us. They don’t know what they are. They are simply people with a perfect, unyielding memory for fact. A love for the verifiable. Their gift is a form of passive magic. They are living repositories of truth, and their presence sanctifies the places they work. The current Chronicler is a man named Arthur Gable. He’s been the City Archivist for thirty years. He is the keeper of the city’s paper soul.”

Arthur Gable. The name meant nothing to Alex. He was probably just a man who liked old documents, unaware that his job made him a lynchpin in a secret war. “So, Lyron is attacking him? His office?”

“He is attacking his domain,” Elara corrected gently. “He will try to plant a lie so deep in the historical record that it becomes indistinguishable from truth. A forged letter. A doctored photograph. A falsified report. Something that gives his narrative of corruption a physical anchor. You must find it, Alex. You must go there, use the ring to find the falsehood, and… unwrite it. You must confront his lie with a fact so solid, so undeniable, that it shatters the illusion.”

The prospect was daunting. He wasn't a historian. He didn't know how to navigate an archive. He was used to search bars and hyperlinks, not card catalogues and microfiche. “How will I even get in?”

Elara closed the ledger and looked at him, a faint, almost mischievous smile touching her lips for the first time that night. “You are the Prince of this place, Alex. The city knows you, even if you’ve forgotten it. The ring you wear is a key, of a sort. Go to the door. Not the main public entrance, but the old staff door at the back. Place your hand upon it. Don’t try to force it. Just… ask. Remember what you are, and ask to be let in. The story of the building will recognise the story in your blood.”

It was the most outlandish thing she had said all night. He was to talk to a door. Part of him, the part that still clocked in and read the script, wanted to scream. But the Alex who had felt the golden pulse of truth push back the black blight on the canal simply nodded. In for a penny, in for a pound. He was already so far beyond the realm of the sensible that asking a door for permission seemed like a logical next step.

The Molineux Hotel was silent and imposing under the dark, drizzly sky. Its ornate terracotta frontage looked like a sleeping giant’s face, its windows dark and empty. Alex circled around the back, his footsteps echoing in a narrow alley that smelled of wet bins and stale beer from the nearby stadium. He found the door exactly where his nan had described it: a heavy, dark green wooden door with a small, grimy window set into it, reinforced with wire mesh. It was bolted, chained, and utterly impassable. He felt a surge of foolishness. He was a trespasser, about to be arrested for talking to a door. He took a deep breath, the damp air chilling his lungs, and placed the palm of his ring hand flat against the cold, peeling paint.

He closed his eyes, shutting out the grimy alley, and tried to do as Elara had said. He didn’t think about locks or hinges. He thought about the building’s story. He pictured it being built, the shouts of the workers, the pride in its newness. He pictured it filled with guests, the hubbub of the hotel lobby, the clink of glasses. He pictured its slow decline and its eventual rebirth as the Archives, a quiet haven for the city’s memories. Then, he focused on himself. Not Alex, the call centre agent. But the "prince." The scion of a line stretching back into the iron and coal of the Black Country. He wasn't demanding entry. He was requesting sanctuary. He was a keeper of the story, asking to enter the library. He thought, with as much conviction as he could muster: *Let me in. I need to protect you.*

For a long moment, nothing. He felt his hope collapsing into self-mockery. Then, a low, groaning sound came from the door, the protest of ancient, rusted metal. He heard a click, sharp and distinct, from the lock. Then another, heavier thud, as if a deadbolt had been drawn back by an invisible hand. He slowly pulled his hand away and reached for the iron handle. It turned with impossible ease. The door swung inward on silent hinges, opening into a pitch-black corridor. He had asked, and the building had answered.

He slipped inside, pulling the heavy door shut behind him. The click of the latch echoed in the profound silence. The darkness was absolute, thick with the scent of old paper, leather, and that unique, dry dust that accumulates only in libraries. He fumbled for his phone, its torch cutting a nervous, dancing beam through the black. He was in a narrow service corridor lined with metal shelves holding cleaning supplies and stacks of old, forgotten stationery. With the ring on his finger, the air itself felt different. The building was humming, not with the discordant wrongness of the canal, but with a deep, layered thrum of a million sleeping stories. It was the collective voice of every birth certificate, every deed of sale, every councillor’s minutes, every letter written home from the war. It was the sound of truth at rest.

His phone’s light seemed inadequate, a profane intrusion. As he moved down the corridor, a flicker of light appeared ahead. Old gas lamps, long-since disconnected, sputtered into a low, ghostly life as he approached, their faint green-tinged glow illuminating the path just ahead of him and extinguishing behind him. The building was guiding him. He followed the spectral breadcrumbs of light out of the service corridors and into the main body of the archives. The public reading room was a cavernous space, the high, ornate ceiling lost in shadow. Long oak tables sat like sleeping beasts, their polished surfaces reflecting the ghostly lamplight. But this wasn’t where Lyron’s lie would be. He needed to go deeper, to the stacks where the raw materials of history were stored.

He could feel it now, a subtle discord in the building’s harmonious hum. It was like a single string on a vast piano being played slightly out of tune. It was a sour, greasy note that tugged at the edge of his perception. He followed the feeling, the ring on his finger acting as a dowsing rod for deceit. The ghostly lights led him to a heavy fire door marked ‘Private – County & Borough Records’. It too opened at his touch. He entered a maze of rolling shelves, packed so tightly together that they formed solid walls of paper and cardboard. The air was cooler here, the smell of history more potent. The discordant note was stronger, pulling him deeper into the labyrinth.

As he moved through the stacks, the threads of Lyron's lie became visible again, no longer the thick, oily ropes of the canal but thin, spidery filaments, seeking purchase. They snaked between the shelves, probing the spines of ledgers and the edges of document boxes. He saw one tendril wrap around a box labelled ‘Public Health Reports 1970-1975’, trying to worm its way inside, to twist a report on factory drainage into something more sinister. The building's own inherent truth seemed to resist, the sheer weight of accumulated fact acting as a passive shield, and the tendril dissolved like smoke. Lyron couldn't just corrupt any old file; he needed to create a new one. A lie with a physical form.

The sour note led him to a small, secluded research nook, where a single desk was piled high with grey archive boxes. A lamp cast a pool of warm, yellow light onto an open ledger, and in the chair sat a man. He was elderly, with a shock of unruly white hair and a cardigan that looked even older and more beloved than his nan’s. He was hunched over the ledger, a magnifying glass in one hand, his brow furrowed in concentration. He hadn’t heard Alex approach. This had to be him. Arthur Gable. The Chronicler.

Alex froze, hidden in the shadows of a nearby shelf. He watched as Arthur muttered to himself, his finger tracing a line of spidery copperplate script. “No… no, that can’t be right. The dates are wrong. The water survey for the Brewer’s Yard development wasn’t commissioned until March. Why would the engineer’s report be dated February?” He shook his head, looking profoundly troubled, as if he had discovered a fundamental law of physics had been violated. He was sensing the lie, not with magic, but with his own encyclopaedic knowledge. The lie was a factual inconsistency, a note so wrong that his perfect pitch for history couldn't help but detect it.

It was on the desk. Alex could see it now. Lying separate from the ledger was a single, yellowed sheet of paper, supposedly a supplementary memo. From a distance, it looked authentic. But to Alex's heightened senses, it was a vortex of corruption. It pulsed with a sickening, grey light, the source of the entire discordant hum in the building. Greasy black threads radiated from it, the anchor for the new narrative about the council cover-up. It was Lyron’s forgery, his poisoned seed planted in the heart of the city's memory. And Arthur Gable, the city’s guardian of fact, was moments away from either dismissing it as an error or, far worse, accepting it as a confusing but genuine historical paradox, giving the lie the legitimacy it craved.Alex had to move. He couldn’t stand there in the shadows and watch the city’s memory be corrupted by a confused old man’s sigh. He had to give Arthur the weapon he needed. He had to fight the lie on its own terms: with documentation. He backed away slowly, deeper into the forest of shelves, letting the ring on his finger guide him. He closed his eyes, ignoring the visual information of shelf labels and catalogue numbers, and focused instead on the texture of the air, the hum of the million sleeping truths. He was looking for a contradiction. He pushed the core concepts of the forgery into his mind—the engineer’s name, the project, the date in February—and used them as search terms, broadcasting them into the narrative hum of the archives.

The response was not a single clear signal, but a subtle resonance from a few aisles over. It was a tugging sensation, a thread of truth that vibrated in perfect opposition to the lie’s sour note. He followed it, the ghostly gas lamps flickering to life just ahead of his feet, illuminating a path through the darkness. He stopped in front of a row of plain, grey cardboard boxes, indistinguishable from thousands of others. But the ring on his finger was warm, and the hum of truth was strongest here. The label on the box was utterly mundane, written in a neat, faded marker: ‘Borough Engineer – Travel & Sundries, 1988-1990’. It was perfect. It was the kind of boring, bureaucratic chaff that no one would ever think to look for, and therefore, the most likely place to find an unvarnished, unglamorous fact.

He carefully lifted the heavy box from the shelf, his muscles protesting the strain. It was heavier than he expected, weighted with the dense reality of forgotten paperwork. He carried it back towards the research nook, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He couldn’t just walk up and hand a document to Arthur. He had to make it a discovery, an accident. He had to let the Chronicler find the truth himself. Peeking around the end of the aisle, he saw Arthur was still staring at the forged memo, rubbing his tired eyes. This was his only chance. Taking a shaky breath, Alex stepped out of the aisle, pretending to stumble. He let the box tip from his hands. It hit the floor with a loud, percussive crash that shattered the sacred silence of the archives. Papers, bound with rusty clips and rubber bands that had long since perished, spilled across the dusty floorboards.

Arthur Gable jumped in his seat, a startled cry escaping his lips. "Good heavens! Who's there? What is all this?" He peered into the gloom, his eyes wide and alarmed. Alex, his face burning with a mixture of real and feigned embarrassment, muttered an apology from the shadows. "Sorry… so sorry… clumsy of me. I'll clear it up." He quickly knelt, gathering the scattered papers, his hands trembling. He didn’t dare look at the archivist. He just scooped and stacked, creating the illusion of tidying, before grabbing the now-empty box and retreating back into the darkness of the stacks as quickly as he had appeared. He left one small sheaf of papers behind on the floor, seemingly missed in his haste. It lay directly in the path between Arthur’s desk and the main aisle.

For a full minute, there was only silence. Alex held his breath, concealed behind a wall of 19th-century census records. He heard the scrape of Arthur’s chair, the soft scuff of his shoes on the wooden floor. "Clumsy fool," Arthur muttered, more to himself than to Alex. "Now, what's this he's missed?" Alex heard him stoop to pick up the stray documents. The papers were a travel expense claim form, brittle and yellowed, along with several attached receipts. Alex risked a glance. Arthur had moved back into the pool of light from his desk lamp. He held the claim form in one hand and the forged memo in the other, his head tilting back and forth between them. The magnificent, dusty machinery of his memory was whirring into life.

"Brewer's Yard site survey... memo dated February 14th," Arthur whispered, his eyes fixed on the forgery. He then looked at the expense claim. "But here... February 12th to 15th... Engineer Cotterill, J... claim for travel to Harrogate. For the Northern Waterways conference. Signed by him. Signed by the department head. Here are the hotel receipts. You can't be in Harrogate and Wolverhampton at the same time, John." The last sentence was spoken with a tone of deep, personal satisfaction, the voice of a man who had found an error in the universe and was now setting it right. A fact had been presented. The lie could not withstand it.

Alex watched, his senses wide open. The forged memo on the desk seemed to wilt. The pulsating grey light within it didn’t explode, it just… switched off. The greasy black threads that had radiated from it, the very structure of the new lie, shrivelled into nothing, like burning spiderwebs. The paper itself, which moments before had thrummed with a malevolent power, became inert. It was just a piece of old paper with lies written on it. The dissonant, sour note that had pervaded the archives vanished, and the deep, harmonious hum of a million sleeping truths returned, settling over the space like a blanket. The crisis was over.

Arthur Gable let out a satisfied "Hmph." He took the forged memo and, with a decisive gesture, placed it in a separate folder, on which he wrote with a fountain pen: ‘Query – Spurious/Incorrectly Dated’. He had not defeated a magical curse; he had corrected a filing error. To him, the distinction was meaningless. The truth was back in its proper place. He carefully re-stacked the travel claims Alex had "dropped", placed them on the corner of his desk for later re-filing, and returned his full attention to the authentic ledger, his world once more making perfect, logical sense.

A profound wave of relief and exhaustion washed over Alex. He felt boneless, held up only by the metal shelving at his back. He had won. He had fed the system a single, undeniable fact, and the system had chewed up the lie and spat it out. He hadn't needed a sword or a spell, just a travel expense form. He slipped away, moving back through the labyrinth of shelves. The ghostly gas lamps guided him once more, their light feeling warmer now, friendlier. They led him back to the green service door, which opened with a silent push into the damp night air of the alley. He stepped out and pulled it shut. He heard the soft, definite thud of the bolt sliding home, the building securing its memories once more. The drizzle had stopped. The air felt cleaner, lighter. He looked up at the night sky, a smear of dark grey with a hint of light pollution. He had fought two battles in one night and won. But he knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the night air, that Lyron would not be defeated so easily. He had only been tested. The real war for the soul of Wolverhampton had just begun.The journey back to his nan’s block was a slow, deliberate march. Each step was a conscious effort, his body screaming for the simple oblivion of sleep. Yet his mind, scoured clean by the night’s events, was preternaturally sharp. The city felt different, as though a low-grade fever he hadn't known it had had finally broken. The air was just air, the distant drone of traffic was just noise, and the faint orange glow of the city centre against the clouds was just light pollution. The absence of the lie was a palpable, peaceful emptiness, and he drank it in like a man dying of thirst. He was so tired he felt transparent, but for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, he was walking through a world that made a plain and simple sense.

He bypassed his own house entirely. There was no point trying to formulate another clumsy lie for his mum, no way to explain the bone-deep weariness that had nothing to do with slipping in the mud. He needed the truth, and the only place he could find that now was on the twelfth floor, in a flat that smelled of lavender and old books. The lift’s groaning ascent was a journey between worlds, from the concrete reality of the street to the strange, mythic realm of his new life. He knocked on door 2B, and it opened instantly. Elara stood there, her small frame wrapped in a thick woollen dressing gown, her eyes knowing and ancient. She didn’t ask what had happened. She simply stepped aside, and the unspoken words ‘well done’ hung in the quiet air between them.

“Tea,” she said, a command, not a question. She shuffled into her small kitchen while Alex collapsed onto her sofa. The springs protested with a weary sigh that mirrored his own. He let his head fall back against the cushions, his gaze falling upon the porcelain birds on the mantelpiece. They looked delicate, fragile, yet utterly permanent. Like the facts in the archive. Like the truth. He felt the heavy silver ring on his finger, its weight a constant, grounding reminder. Elara returned with two steaming mugs, placing one on the doily beside him. The comforting aroma of strong tea filled his senses, a small, solid piece of normality.

“He’s angry,” she said, settling into her armchair. It wasn't a guess. Her gaze was distant, fixed on the panoramic window as if she could see the ripples of their victory spreading across the city’s narrative web. “You didn’t just foil his plan, Alex. You embarrassed him. You used the driest, most mundane piece of truth, a travel expense form, to unravel his carefully constructed fiction. You fought him with bureaucracy. He won’t appreciate the irony.”

Alex took a sip of tea, the heat scalding his tongue. “So he’ll stop? Go somewhere else?” The hope was a flimsy thing in his own throat.

Elara’s smile was sad. “No, my love. He will escalate. He tried horror, a story to create fear. It was too blunt, too easily dismissed as a hoax. Then he tried politics, a story to create division. You used the city’s own memory to disprove it. Now he will try something more subtle. More insidious. He won’t attack what the city remembers, or what it fears. He will attack how it *feels*.” She paused, letting the weight of the words settle in the quiet room. “He’s going after its rhythm. He’s going to target the Musician.”

Alex felt a new kind of dread, colder and more abstract than before. He could understand a physical blight, a forged document. But a rhythm? A feeling? “The Musician? Nan, what does that even mean? How can you attack a rhythm?”

“Every city has a heartbeat, Alex. A tempo. It’s in the sound of the morning traffic, the chatter in the market, the collective roar from the Molineux on a Saturday afternoon. It’s the rhythm of people’s lives, living together. It’s the baseline of community. It’s a story told not in words, but in sound. And there is a person whose soul is perfectly attuned to it. A person who doesn’t just hear it, but broadcasts it, reinforces it.” She gestured towards the city lights with her mug. “Her name is Jasmine Kaur. Most people know her as Jaz, the host of the late-night show on WCR FM. She’s the city’s Musician. Her gift isn’t knowing history, it’s knowing the mood. She can play a song that will perfectly capture the feeling of a rainy Tuesday, or a hopeful Friday night. She connects people through shared sound, even when they are alone in their cars or their kitchens. She strengthens the golden threads without ever knowing she’s doing it.”

A late-night radio DJ. The idea was so normal, so mundane, that it made the danger feel even more surreal. “And Lyron’s going to… what? Get her show cancelled?”

“Worse. He will hijack it. He will create a sound, a song, a piece of anti-music. An earworm from hell,” Elara said, her voice dropping low. “It won’t be a story you read online; it will be a melody you can’t get out of your head. It won’t create panic or anger. It will create something far more dangerous: a quiet, creeping disharmony. It will be a tune that isolates, that makes the listener feel disconnected, apathetic, alone. It will slowly untune the entire city, making every person feel like they are the only one hearing a song that everyone else is humming. It will dissolve the bonds of community from the inside out.”

The concept was terrifying. It was an attack that bypassed logic and reason entirely, aiming directly for the subconscious. How could he possibly fight that? He wasn’t a DJ. He couldn’t even hold a tune. He looked down at his hands, the hands that had reset passwords and, just hours ago, had held the dusty truth of an expense claim. They were not the hands of someone who could fight a war of music.

“What can I do?” he asked, his voice barely a whisper. “I can’t fight a song.”

“No,” Elara agreed, her eyes locking with his. “You can’t. But Jaz can. Lyron’s lie will feel like a brilliant new discovery to her, a piece of genius, avant-garde music she’ll be desperate to share. You have to get to her before she does. You can't show her a document to prove it's a lie. You have to make her feel the truth. The ring will help you identify the false song, the source of the discord. But to fight it, you have to help her find the counter-melody. The city’s true song. It’s not something you can look up in a book, Alex. It’s a sound you have to listen for, in the streets and in the people. You have to find the city’s heartbeat and remind her what it sounds like.” She leaned forward, her expression more serious than ever. “This is a harder fight, and a more dangerous one. A lie in a document can be corrected. A song in the heart is much harder to remove.”Sleep was a luxury he couldn't afford. The exhaustion had settled deep in his bones, a heavy, leaden ache, but his mind was a live wire, thrumming with the aftershocks of the night and the grim forecast of the next battle. He left his nan’s flat and walked out into the pre-dawn quiet, the city holding its breath before the first wave of commuters began their daily charge. He had a name, Jasmine Kaur, and a location, WCR FM. The station, he knew from its own incessant advertising jingles, was housed not in a glittering tower, but in a squat, brutalist block near the ring road, a building that looked like a concrete bunker someone had reluctantly punched windows into. It was a fittingly unglamorous headquarters for the city’s audio soul.

Elara’s words echoed in his head: *Listen for the city’s heartbeat*. As he walked, he forced his senses open, using the ring not as a weapon, but as a microphone. He filtered out the obvious noises—the whine of a lone taxi, the distant wail of a siren—and listened for the sounds beneath. He heard the rhythmic, metallic clang from a bakery down a side street, where a baker was loading trays for the morning rush, a beat as old as bread itself. He heard the low, resonant hum from the direction of the hospital, a collective sound of machinery and vigilance that never slept. From an open window on the top floor of a council block, he caught a fragment of a lullaby being sung in a language he didn’t know, a thread of pure, tender melody stitched into the vast, dark fabric of the night. These were the notes. This was the city’s true song, a symphony of small, persistent survivals.

The WCR building was even less inspiring up close. Grey, stained concrete walls rose to a flat roof bristling with aerials and satellite dishes. The ground floor was dark, but lights were on in a long, horizontal window on the third floor, a strip of warmth and life in the monolithic structure. The main entrance was a set of heavy glass doors, firmly locked. A small, intercom panel glowed next to them. Alex knew that buzzing and trying to explain his mission to a skeptical night-time security guard was a fool’s errand. He remembered the door at the archives, but this place was different. It wasn’t a place of quiet, solid history. It was a place of transmission, of signals and airwaves. He pressed his hand to the cold glass of the door, the ring cool against the surface. He didn’t ask to be let in. He thought about the station’s purpose, its invisible network of signals reaching into cars, homes, and lonely night-shift canteens. He wasn’t trying to break into a building; he was trying to join a network. He focused on the ring, not as a key, but as a tuner, trying to match its frequency to the building's broadcast. *I’m part of the story,* he thought, focusing the idea with all his might. *Let me speak.*

The intercom on the wall crackled, a burst of static that made him jump. A bored, tinny voice spoke. “Yeah? Who is it? We’re not taking requests, mate.” Alex stared at the speaker, his mind blank. He hadn’t pressed the button. The building had answered him. “I’m… I’m here to see Jaz,” he stammered, his own voice sounding thin and ridiculous. There was a long pause, filled with more static. “She’s not expecting anyone.” Alex’s desperation overrode his caution. “It’s important. It’s about the… playlist. A new track. It’s urgent.” He was gambling, throwing out words he hoped would mean something. Another pause, longer this time. Alex was sure the connection would be cut. Then, a loud buzz echoed in the lobby, and the magnetic lock on the glass door clicked open. “Third floor. Don’t touch anything.” The voice cut out.

The lift smelled of stale coffee and cleaning fluid. As he ascended, he felt the discordant hum again, the sour note of Lyron’s magic. It was different this time, not a greasy physical presence, but a thin, needle-like vibration in the air itself, carried on the building's own electrical currents. It was a signal, waiting to be broadcast. The lift doors opened onto a long, dimly lit corridor lined with posters of beaming, airbrushed DJs. At the far end, through a glass-panelled door, he saw a single studio, bathed in the soft glow of monitors and mixing desks. This was the source of the hum. He pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The room was a chaotic sanctuary. Mugs were piled precariously on speakers, scrawled-on CDs and records lined every surface, and the walls were plastered with band posters and scribbled notes. In the centre of it all, haloed by the light of a monitor, sat Jasmine Kaur. She was younger than he’d expected, with a cascade of dark hair held back by a pair of oversized headphones. She was completely absorbed, her fingers dancing over a mixing desk, her head nodding slightly to a beat only she could hear. As Alex stepped into the room, she looked up, her eyes bright and intelligent, but also deeply tired. She slid the headphones down around her neck. “Okay, you’ve got thirty seconds to explain why you conned my security guard before I have you thrown out,” she said, her voice the same smooth, velvety instrument he’d heard on the radio, but edged with steel.

“You can’t play it,” Alex said, the words tumbling out. “The new track. The one you’ve just found. It’s… wrong.” He knew how insane he sounded. Jaz raised an eyebrow, a mixture of amusement and irritation on her face. “Wrong? Pal, it’s the most incredible thing I’ve heard in years. It’s genius. It’s like nothing else out there.” She gestured to her monitor, her face lighting up with genuine passion. “No artist name, just a raw file that showed up on a deep-dive search. It’s clean, minimalist, perfect. It’s the sound of right now. It’s the sound of… peace.” She reached for a fader on the desk. “Here, you tell me if this is wrong.”

Before Alex could protest, she slid the fader up. The music didn’t blare; it seeped into the room. It was exactly as Elara had described. It was a piece of anti-music. A simple, looping melody played on what sounded like a cold, digital piano. The notes were perfectly spaced, mathematically precise, with vast, empty silences between them. There was no warmth, no passion, no human flaw. And it was devastatingly beautiful. Alex felt it instantly, a wave of profound, logical despair washing over him. The music whispered directly to the tired, beaten-down part of his soul, the part that hated his job and the grey drizzle. It didn’t argue or shout; it simply presented a compelling case for giving up. It told him that striving was pointless, that connection was an illusion, and that the most rational, peaceful state of being was a quiet, isolated apathy. The beige-coloured hell of his old life was being sold back to him as a state of grace.

“Stop,” he gasped, stumbling back, his hand flying to his head as if to physically block the sound. The comfortable embrace of meaninglessness was terrifyingly seductive. The ring on his finger felt ice-cold, its connection to the city’s truth being jammed by this sterile, perfect lie. Jaz looked at him, a flicker of concern replacing her annoyance. “Hey, you alright? It’s just a piece of music.” But he could see it in her eyes too. A distant, glazed look. She was already half-seduced by it.

He had to act. He lunged forward, not towards the mixing desk, but towards the large microphone on a boom arm in front of her, the one she used to speak to the city. He grabbed its heavy base, the cold metal a solid anchor in the disorienting sea of sound. He closed his eyes, shutting out the sterile studio, and forced himself to remember. He remembered the clanging of the baker’s trays, the hum of the hospital, the whispered lullaby. He poured the memory of those sounds, the feeling of them, the stories they told, into his hand. He wasn’t just a prince of narrative; he was a conduit for it.

“This isn’t the city’s song,” he said, his voice low and urgent, amplified slightly by his proximity to the live mic. “It’s an absence. The real song isn’t this clean. It’s messy. It’s the clatter of plates from the late-night Balti houses. It’s the roar from the South Bank when the Wolves score, a sound that’s half hope and half fury. It’s the rhythm of the machines in the factories that still run through the night, a heartbeat of iron that’s been beating for two hundred years.” He opened his eyes and looked straight at Jaz, willing her to understand. “It’s the sound of your own voice, Jaz. The way you sound when you introduce a song you truly love, the way you connect a lonely truck driver on the M6 with a student cramming for an exam. That’s the rhythm. It’s the sound of people trying, failing, and trying again. It’s not perfect. It’s not peaceful. It’s just… real.”

As he spoke, he channelled everything through the ring, through the microphone, pushing the chaotic, warm, complicated truth of the city’s soundscape into the room as a tangible feeling. Jaz flinched, pulling her headphones off completely. She looked from Alex’s desperate face to the monitor, where the waveform of Lyron’s song scrolled past, a series of cold, perfect, sterile blocks. For the first time, she seemed to truly hear it for what it was. The beautiful, minimalist melody suddenly sounded hollow. The silences were no longer peaceful; they were empty, devoid of life. The genius she had perceived was revealed as a profound and terrifying vacancy. A single tear traced a path down her cheek. “It’s so… empty,” she whispered, her voice filled with a horrified disillusionment. With a sudden, decisive movement, she spun to her keyboard, her fingers flying. She selected the audio file—the perfect, poisonous lie—and, without a moment’s hesitation, dragged it to the trash icon on her desktop. A small, animated puff of smoke confirmed its deletion. The sterile music stopped. The silence that followed was not empty. It was full. It was full of the low hum of the equipment, the sound of their breathing, the distant rumble of the city outside. It was a real silence, and it was beautiful.For a long moment, the only sound in the studio was the gentle whir of a computer fan and the distant, rhythmic hum of the city waking up. The silence was a physical presence, a clean space where the poisonous melody had been. Jaz Kaur sat motionless, her hands resting on the mixing desk, staring at the empty trash icon on her monitor as if it were a fresh grave. The single tear had been joined by another, and she wiped them away with an angry, trembling hand. She finally turned to look at Alex, and her eyes were not filled with gratitude, but with a raw, unnerving combination of fear and violation.

“What was that?” she whispered, her voice, usually so smooth and confident, now brittle. “It wasn’t just a song. It felt… it felt like it was hollowing me out. Like it was proving that everything I love about music, about this job… was a pointless waste of time.” She looked down at her own hands. “I was going to play it. I was seconds away from sending that… emptiness out to the whole city. I thought it was beautiful.” The self-recrimination in her voice was sharp. She had been betrayed, not by a person, but by her own artistic judgment, her own ear.

Alex’s exhaustion was a heavy cloak, but he knew this was a critical moment. He couldn’t afford to sound like a lunatic. He had to anchor the impossible truth in her own experience. “Because a part of it felt true,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “The part that knows how tiring it all is. The grey days, the thankless jobs. It’s a story. A very simple, very seductive story that says the best thing to do is just… stop. But it’s a lie. It’s a story designed to make us forget all the other ones.” He leaned forward, gesturing around the chaotic, vibrant studio. “This room is full of them. Every one of these records is a story. Joy, anger, love, heartbreak. It’s messy and loud and complicated. That’s the truth. That thing,” he nodded towards the monitor, “was a lie designed to silence all of it.”

Jaz shook her head slowly, trying to process it. “A story? It was just notes. A melody.” She looked at him, her gaze sharpening. “And how did you know? You came in here like a man on fire, talking about playlists. How did you know what it would do?” Alex took a breath and made a decision. He held up his right hand, letting the low light of the studio glint on the dull, heavy silver of the ring. He didn't present it with a flourish, just showed it to her as a simple fact. “My nan calls this an amplifier. It helps me… hear the stories underneath. The true ones and the false ones. I felt that song, your new track, like a nail being hammered into my skull. I felt what it was trying to do.”

He expected her to laugh, to call security, to dismiss him as one of the city's many eccentrics. Instead, she just stared at the ring, then back at his face. She was the Musician. Her soul understood resonance and discord on a level he couldn’t. She had felt the wrongness of the song, and she had felt the profound, chaotic truth in the words he’d poured into her microphone. She didn’t believe in magic, but she believed in what she had just felt. “So this… storyteller… he’s real? Someone is doing this deliberately?” she asked, the concept so vast and strange it seemed to suck the air from the room.

“His name is Lyron,” Alex said, the name tasting like poison. “And yes. He’s real. This is the third lie he’s tried to tell the city in two days.” He gave her the briefest, most surreal summary of his week: the canal blight born from a hashtag, the forged document in the archives. As he spoke, he watched her face change from disbelief to a dawning, horrified understanding. She wasn’t just a DJ who had narrowly avoided playing a bad track. She had been an unknowing soldier, nearly turned into a weapon in a war she hadn’t known existed. The alliance was fragile, forged in shared trauma and the echoes of a phantom melody. “I don’t understand half of what you’re saying,” she said finally, her voice regaining a fraction of its usual steadiness. “But I know what I heard. And I know what I felt. If this Lyron tries to use my airwaves to tell his stories again, he’ll have a fight on his hands.” She looked around her studio, her domain, her eyes alight with a new, fierce protectiveness. “You have my number. Call me if you hear anything… out of tune.”

Leaving the WCR building felt like stepping back into his own skin. The sun was a pale disc behind a blanket of cloud, casting a weak, watery light over the waking city. The morning rush hour was beginning, a river of red brake lights and white headlights, the city's metallic heartbeat picking up its daily tempo. He had an ally. A real one. Someone else who, on some level, now knew. He felt a surge of something he hadn’t experienced in years: a clear, sharp sense of purpose. He hadn’t just been reacting, he had acted. He had won. For a moment, walking past the tired faces of people on their way to work, he didn't feel like a fraud playing at being a prince. He just felt like a man who was fighting for his home. He decided to go straight to his nan's, to tell her what had happened, to see the relief in her eyes. It was a victory he wanted to share.

He was halfway there, his mind replaying the events in the studio, when his phone vibrated in his pocket. He smiled, thinking it might be Jaz. But the screen displayed his mum’s name. He answered, a cheerful “Hiya, Mum” already on his lips, but it died before it could be spoken. He was met not with his mother’s usual morning greeting, but with a choked, frantic sob. "Al? Oh, thank God. It's Nan. You've got to get here. Now."

The calm, victorious world he had been inhabiting shattered into a million pieces. "Mum? What is it? Is she hurt?" he asked, his own heart starting to hammer against his ribs. "No, it's… it's worse," Sandra’s voice was a torrent of panicked words. "It’s Carol from next door to her. And Mrs. Higgins from down the hall. They've called the council, Al. Social services. They're saying Nan's a danger to herself. That she’s been wandering the corridors at all hours, talking nonsense about 'whispering princes' and 'wars of stories'. Someone said she threatened them. It’s lies, Al, all of it, but they’re… they’re talking about an emergency assessment. About taking her away. There's a van outside. An ambulance. You have to stop them."

A cold so profound it felt like it was freezing him from the inside out spread through his limbs. He could feel it, even from here. A new narrative, clinging to his grandmother like a shroud. A thick, sticky, plausible story woven from half-truths and neighborly concern, twisted into a weapon. Lyron had been embarrassed. He had been defeated. And now, he was retaliating. He hadn’t attacked a canal or an archive or a radio station. He had come for the heart of the resistance. He was attacking a little old lady in a tower block, using the mundane, bureaucratic machinery of the modern world as his cudgel. This wasn’t a story to cause fear or division in the city; it was a story to erase its memory, to discredit its keeper, to break its prince’s heart.

“I’m coming,” he said, his voice a low, dangerous growl he didn’t recognise as his own. He broke into a run, his earlier exhaustion completely burned away by a surge of pure, cold adrenaline. He sprinted through the morning crowds, ignoring the angry shouts and surprised glances. He could see the tower block in the distance, a concrete tombstone against the grey sky. As he got closer, he saw exactly what his mum had described. A white social services van and a green-and-yellow ambulance were parked at the entrance, their official liveries a stamp of dreadful legitimacy. A small knot of residents, including Carol from next door, were gathered at a safe distance, their faces a sickly mixture of pity, fear, and self-righteous justification. He could feel the lie spreading between them in their hushed whispers and worried glances, a contagion of concern. Lyron’s most vicious story yet was coming true, right here on the pavement. Alex didn't slow down. He plunged through the glass doors of the lobby and jabbed the button for the lift, knowing he was heading into a battle not for the city's soul, but for his grandmother's. And he had no idea if it was a fight he could win.The lift doors opened on the twelfth floor to a scene of quiet, bureaucratic warfare. The corridor, usually a silent, neutral space, was charged with a thick, cloying atmosphere of professional concern. This was Lyron’s new poison, and it was the most potent yet. It wasn’t the monstrous horror of the canal or the sterile apathy of the song; it was a story of benevolent intervention, a narrative of ‘doing what’s best’ that was suffocatingly plausible. Two paramedics, a man and a woman, stood impassively by the wall, their presence a clinical threat. A woman in a smart but functional coat, holding a clipboard like a shield, was talking in low, soothing tones to his mum. And there, hovering by her own doorway with a ghoulish, self-important piety, was Carol from next door. The greasy threads of the lie emanated from her, weaving themselves around the uniforms and the clipboard, lending a false weight to every concerned murmur.

His mother, Sandra, saw him first, and a wave of desperate relief washed over her face. "Al! Thank God. Tell them. Tell them it's all lies." Her voice was high and frantic, her hands twisting the strap of her handbag. Alex saw the social worker’s eyes flick towards him, her expression hardening slightly. His mother’s panic was being logged as evidence, another tick in the box marked ‘unstable family environment’. He moved towards her, placing his hands on her shoulders, his own voice unnaturally calm. "It's alright, Mum. I'm here now. Let me handle it. Go and put the kettle on in Nan's flat, eh? We could all do with a cup of tea." The simple, domestic instruction seemed to ground her. She hesitated, then nodded, giving the social worker a final, baleful glare before pushing past her into the open doorway of 2B.

Alex turned his full attention to the woman with the clipboard. He could feel the story she was operating under, a crisp, official narrative of safeguarding a vulnerable elderly person. It was a good story, a story that made her the hero. He had to give her a better one. "Hi," he said, holding out a hand. "I'm Alex, Elara's grandson. My mum called. Can you tell me what’s going on?" His calmness seemed to surprise her. She took his hand briefly, her grip firm and professional. "I'm Ms. Albright, from Adult Social Care. We've received several reports from residents expressing serious concerns about your grandmother's welfare. Reports of confused behaviour, self-neglect, and some worrying verbal threats. We're here to conduct an emergency welfare assessment."

The words were textbook, each one a neat, polished brick in the wall of the lie. 'Confused behaviour' was his nan's storytelling. 'Self-neglect' was a baseless smear. But 'verbal threats' – that was the poisoned barb, the part of the story designed to give them the legal power to act. He could feel the utter falsehood of it, a hollow space in the narrative. "Threats? My grandmother?" He kept his voice even, tinged with a credible disbelief. "I think there's been a serious misunderstanding. Can we talk inside? I'd rather not discuss her health in a public corridor." He didn't wait for an answer, just turned and walked into the flat, forcing them to follow him into his territory, into the heart of his counter-narrative.

The flat was his first and best weapon. It was immaculate. The clutter was meticulously ordered, the porcelain birds on the mantelpiece were free of dust, and the air smelled faintly of furniture polish and the mince and onions his mum was reheating on the stove, a defiant act of normality. And there, in her usual armchair, sat Elara. She wasn't ranting or crying. She was bolt upright, holding one of her porcelain thrushes in her lap, her hands perfectly still. Her eyes, bird-bright and blazing with a cold, contained fury, were fixed on Ms. Albright. She looked less like a confused old woman and more like a queen whose court had been invaded by barbarians. The narrative of 'self-neglect' and 'confusion' faltered in the face of the scene's quiet, defiant dignity.

Alex ignored the officials and walked straight to his nan’s chair, kneeling beside it so he was at her eye level. "Alright, Nan?" he asked, his voice soft. "Mum’s making a fuss with the mince, says you haven't been eating properly." He was performing for his audience, playing the role of the caring, slightly chiding grandson. Elara picked up her cue without missing a beat. "Your mother worries if I miss a biscuit," she sniffed, her voice crisp and clear. "I was just about to sort my paperwork for the Residents' Association meeting. We're voting on the new recycling bins. A surprisingly contentious issue." She glanced at Ms. Albright. "Some people," she added, her voice laced with acid, "have far too much time on their hands."

The social worker was now standing awkwardly in the middle of the room, her clipboard seeming a little less like a shield and more like a prop. The paramedics were hovering by the door, their expressions shifting from alert readiness to something closer to boredom. Alex stood up and faced Ms. Albright directly. "As you can see, she's hardly confused," he said, his tone reasonable. "She runs the tower block's book club. She balances the accounts for the knitting circle. The only 'threats' she makes are to fine people who don't rewind their videotapes before returning them." He gestured around the flat. "Does this look like a home suffering from self-neglect?"

He walked to the doorway, where Carol was still lurking, her face a mask of wounded helpfulness. "Carol," he said, his voice dropping but losing none of its edge. "Mum said you were the one who called. You were worried Nan was talking nonsense about princes and wars?" Carol flushed, stammering. "Well, yes, she was going on and on, it didn't make any sense…" Alex smiled, a thin, humourless expression. "It’s her party piece, Carol. She's been telling those silly Black Country folk tales since I was a boy. Honestly, I thought you knew that. You must have caught her rehearsing for her storytelling group." He had just offered a new narrative: not madness, but an eccentric hobby. He had re-framed the lie as a simple, embarrassing misunderstanding. He could feel the greasy threads of Lyron's story fraying, losing their grip as Carol's certainty crumbled into doubt.

Ms. Albright looked from Alex’s steady gaze, to Elara’s imperious calm, to Sandra who was now placing mugs on a tray with steady hands, to the wilting, embarrassed face of Carol in the hall. The story she had arrived with, the one on her clipboard, was falling apart. It didn't fit the facts in front of her. She was a professional, and her professionalism demanded she respond to the evidence. She let out a long, quiet sigh, a sound of capitulation. "Right," she said, her official tone softening into human weariness. "It seems the situation may have been… overstated." She nodded to the paramedics, who visibly relaxed. "I think an emergency assessment is unnecessary at this time. I'll cancel the ambulance." She made a note on her clipboard. "I'll still need to schedule a routine follow-up, Mr…?" "Alex," he supplied. "Of course. We'd welcome it."

They left. The van and the ambulance pulled away from the kerb. The neighbours melted back into their flats, the brief drama over. Alex closed the door to 2B, and the sound of the latch clicking into place was the loudest thing he had ever heard. The three of them stood in the sudden, absolute silence, the adrenaline of the fight draining away, leaving a vacuum in its wake. The performance was over. Elara’s proud, straight back finally slumped. The porcelain bird slipped from her fingers, falling onto the thick carpet with a soft thud. Sandra put down the tray of tea, her hands shaking so much the mugs rattled in their saucers, and she finally let out a single, ragged sob.

Alex looked from his exhausted nan to his terrified mum, and the victory felt utterly hollow. He had fought back the lie, but the sanctuary had been violated. The war was no longer something happening out there, in the canals and archives of the city. It had come through their front door. He walked to the window and looked down at the street below, at the ordinary people walking their ordinary paths. Lyron hadn't needed to poison the water or hijack the airwaves to cause this much pain. He had simply picked up the phone. He had used the systems designed to protect the vulnerable to terrorize them. He had turned the city's own mechanisms of care into a weapon. The battle for Wolverhampton was no longer about saving a place. It was about surviving it.The silence that descended after the door clicked shut was heavier than any sound. It was the silence of a battlefield after the fighting stops, thick with the ghosts of what had just happened. For a moment, the three of them were frozen, a tableau of shock and exhaustion. Then Sandra, his rock, his anchor to the world of mince and onions and common sense, crumpled. The tray of tea clattered onto the coffee table, brown liquid splashing across the doilies. She sank into a chair, her head in her hands, and the single sob she’d held back broke into a torrent of desperate, ragged weeping. It was the sound of a world breaking.

Alex moved towards her, but Elara’s frail hand shot out and gripped his wrist. Her fingers were like cold steel. “Let her be,” she whispered, her voice a thread of sound, but with an iron core. “The story has touched her now. It hurts. Let her grieve for the world she thought she lived in.” Alex looked at his grandmother. The imperious queen had vanished, replaced by a woman who seemed a hundred years old, her skin the colour of parchment, her eyes hollowed out with a fatigue so profound it looked like it was consuming her from within. She had faced down the lie, but the effort had cost her dearly.

"Nan, you need to rest," he said, his own voice sounding hollow in his ears. She shook her head, a small, stubborn movement. "There's no time for rest. This changes things. He's no longer just telling stories to the city. He's telling them *about* us. He's trying to write us out of our own lives. He failed to break the city's heart, so he tried to break mine instead." A flicker of the old fire returned to her eyes. "He is done with subtlety. He has failed to poison the water, corrupt the record, and silence the music. He will go for the source. The foundation."

Alex felt a new wave of weariness. "The foundation? What's left, Nan? He's come after you. After our family." He looked over at his mother, who was now just staring blankly at the spilled tea, her weeping subsided into a state of silent shock. This was the real damage. This was the wound that wouldn’t heal so easily.

"He's been chipping away at the city's sense of self," Elara continued, her voice gaining strength as she focused on the familiar cadence of her lore. "He has attacked its Body, its Mind, and its Voice. All that is left is its Bones. The physical, tangible truth of its past. The objects that prove its story. The artifacts that hold its memory in wood and iron and stone. He’s going for the museum." She pointed a trembling finger towards the old wooden chest. "The final guardian he has not yet challenged. The Curator."

The museum. The idea seemed almost quaint after the brutal, personal nature of the last attack. "What could be in a museum that's more important than you, or the archives?" Alex asked, bewildered. "Old pots? Some rusty tools?"

“One rusty tool in particular,” Elara corrected him. “The First Anvil. It’s not a grand or beautiful thing. It’s a block of scarred, pitted iron, brought here by one of the first ironmasters in the 1700s. It was the anvil upon which the first tools of this city’s industry were forged. It is the beginning of the story. It is a symbol not of what was made, but of the will to make things. Of resilience. Of creation itself. It is the city's anchor-truth. If Lyron can destroy it, or, far worse, *rewrite its story*—claim it was an instrument of cruelty, a stone of greed—he can poison the city’s entire origin story. He can make it believe it was rotten from the very beginning. With an origin story that foul, no tale of hope or resilience can ever take root again." The scale of it was dizzying. It was a checkmate move, aimed at the very first square on the board.

Before he could process the implications, his mother finally spoke, her voice flat and dead. "No." Alex and Elara both turned to look at her. Sandra stood up, her face pale and set like stone. "No more, Al. I don't know what this is. I don't know if it's magic or madness or some kind of horrible, complicated prank, but I want it to stop. Look at your Nan. Look at this flat. They tried to take her away. Because of these stories. I want you to take that ring off your finger, and I want you to walk away from all of this. Go to work. Come home. Have your tea. Let this be. Whatever it is, it's not worth this." It wasn’t a plea. It was an ultimatum. For the first time in his life, his mother was looking at him with something other than love. She was looking at him with fear.

He looked from his mother's terrified, desperate face to his grandmother's exhausted but resolute one. He felt the silver ring on his finger, no longer a strange artifact, but a part of him. He thought of the cold, perfect emptiness of Lyron’s song, the greasy feel of his lies. His mum wanted him to go back to the beige-coloured hell, because hell was at least familiar. It was safe. But he couldn't. He couldn't unsee the war. To walk away now would be to surrender not just the city, but his family, to the creeping poison. "I can't, Mum," he said, the words hurting him more than any of Lyron’s attacks. "I can't stop. Because if I do, he wins. This won't end. It will just get worse." Sandra stared at him, her expression crumbling. It was a look of profound betrayal. Without another word, she grabbed her handbag, walked out of the flat, and pulled the door shut behind her, leaving Alex alone with his grandmother in the wreckage of their morning.

He called Jaz from the corridor, unable to bear the heavy, wounded silence in the flat. He needed to hear a voice that was part of this new, terrible reality. He kept it brief, his voice low and tight. He told her about the attack on his nan, the way Lyron had twisted the system against them. He heard her sharp intake of breath over the line. "The bastard," she said, the two words a knot of pure fury. "He's not just playing games, he's hurting people. Real people." There was a pause, the sound of her thinking. "Listen, Alex. My show… it reaches people. If you need to get a message out, a real one, a counter-story… if you need to warn people about a lie without calling it a lie… I can help you. You've got an ally on the airwaves. Use it." The offer was a lifeline in the churning sea of his fear and anger. He had a weapon his nan’s line had never possessed: mass media. "Thanks, Jaz," he said, the words feeling inadequate. "I might need it." He ended the call, his resolve hardening into a cold, sharp point. Lyron had made it personal. Now, Alex was going to return the favour.

The Wolverhampton Art Gallery & Museum was a grand, classical building of pale Portland stone, a stark contrast to the red brick and concrete that surrounded it. Inside, the noise of the city was replaced by a hushed reverence. The air was cool and still. Alex paid the optional donation and walked into the main hall, feeling like an intruder. It was bright, open, and filled with ordinary people: a school group being herded by a tired-looking teacher, a young couple holding hands in front of a landscape painting, an elderly man intently studying a display of local pottery. This was Lyron’s next battlefield, and it was utterly, terrifyingly normal.

He didn't know who he was looking for. He only had Elara's description: the Curator, a person who protected the city's artifacts, unaware of their true role. He wandered through the galleries, the ring on his finger a cool, dormant weight. He drifted past displays of Georgian silver, Victorian watercolours, and modern, abstract sculptures. None of them held the resonance he was looking for. He felt like a fraud, a man looking for a magical needle in a haystack of history. He followed the signs for the Local History gallery, his feet taking him past a reconstructed 1950s living room and a display on the golden age of local cinema. And then he felt it.

It started as a low thrum, a deep, foundational note that vibrated through the polished floor and up into the bones of his feet. It was a note of immense age, density, and purpose. It was the hum of the archives, but instead of being woven from a million small stories, it was a single, monolithic chord of truth. He followed the feeling into a large, dimly lit room dedicated to the city's industrial heritage. In the centre of the room, on a solid oak plinth, sat the source of the hum. The First Anvil. It was exactly as Elara had described: a squat, powerful block of dark iron, its surface a landscape of scars, dents, and imperfections. It wasn't beautiful, but it radiated an aura of absolute, undeniable reality. It was a physical fact. This is where we began.

A figure was standing by the anvil, polishing the glass of the case that would normally cover it. The case was currently raised on hydraulic struts, leaving the anvil exposed. The figure was a woman in her fifties, with short, practical grey hair and a focused, no-nonsense expression. She wore a dark blue staff polo shirt. She moved with a quiet, practiced efficiency, her attention entirely on her task. As Alex drew closer, he felt a second, subtler hum emanating from her. It was a clear, calm resonance of order, preservation, and respect. It was the quiet, steady song of a guardian. This was the Curator.

He watched her for a moment, trying to think of a way to approach her. Then his eyes were drawn to a newly printed information panel waiting on a nearby cart, ready to be installed. The current plaque was short and factual. 'Iron Anvil, c. 1760. Used in the workshops of Ironmaster Thomas Eades.' But the new panel was different. It was much longer. His eyes scanned the text, and a chill snaked down his spine. The language was academic, persuasive. It spoke of how recent analysis had revealed Eades’s company had sourced materials from plantations built on slave labour, how this anvil was not just a tool of industry, but a symbol of colonial exploitation, its very iron tainted by suffering. The story was plausible, well-researched, and filled with footnotes. It was a perfect, targeted lie, designed not to be disproven, but to be debated, to cast a permanent shadow, to turn a symbol of creation into a source of shame. Lyron wasn't just rewriting the story; he was poisoning the well of history itself. The Curator finished her polishing and turned towards the cart, her hand reaching for the new plaque. She was about to unwittingly install the city's new, corrupted origin story.Time seemed to slow down, each second stretching into a thick, viscous strand. The Curator’s hand, calloused and capable, reached for the new plaque. In that instant, Alex saw the entire chain of events that would follow: the plaque installed, its toxic narrative absorbed by the school children, the articles in the local paper, the slow, irreversible poisoning of the city’s origin story. He had to sever the chain before the first link was forged. He cleared his throat, the sound ridiculously loud in the reverent quiet of the gallery.

“Excuse me,” he said. The Curator turned, her expression one of professional patience, the kind reserved for tourists asking where the toilets are. “Sorry to bother you,” Alex continued, forcing a slightly breathless, enthusiastic tone, channeling the energy of an amateur history nerd. “This is the First Anvil, isn’t it? It’s just… incredible to see it up close. Without the glass.” He stepped forward, putting himself between her and the cart with the new plaque. The air around the anvil itself was clean, humming with its deep, foundational truth. The air around the new plaque, however, felt greasy and wrong, a slick film of deceit that made the hairs on his arms stand up.

The Curator’s posture softened slightly. A genuine question about the exhibit was a welcome change from the usual. “It is,” she said, a flicker of pride in her eyes. “We only get to do a deep clean and check the mountings once a year. It’s quite a piece of history.” She looked at the anvil with a fond, proprietary air. Alex saw his opening. “I was just wondering,” he said, feigning a thoughtful frown, “I’ve read that the surface scarring isn’t just from use, but from the cooling process of the iron itself. That the impurities rising to the surface created a unique character before it was ever even struck. Is that right?” He had no idea if it was right; he was pulling the pseudo-fact from thin air, a desperate conversational gambit.

It worked. The Curator, now firmly in her element as an educator, launched into a detailed explanation of 18th-century iron smelting techniques, her hands gesturing towards the pitted surface of the anvil. As she spoke, Alex pulled out his phone. He angled his body away from her, pretending to be looking up a related fact. His thumb, usually a tool for numb scrolling, now moved with frantic purpose. He opened his messages to Arthur Gable. He typed, his words a jumble of abbreviations and urgent pleas. *‘New plaque for First Anvil. Claims maker Thomas Eades used slave trade materials. Cites Eades Shipping Co. & Jamaican plantations. URGENT. Any truth??’* He hit send, his heart hammering against his ribs.

“...so the high carbon content made it brittle in some ways, but incredibly hard in others,” the Curator was saying. Alex looked up, nodding as if he’d been hanging on every word. “Fascinating,” he said, his voice a little too tight. “So, the new plaque…” He gestured towards the cart. “Is that part of a re-evaluation of the collection?” He had to keep her talking, to keep her pride and expertise engaged. “Oh, yes,” she said, turning to the new plaque with a sigh that was part professional satisfaction, part weariness. “The new scholarship is very thorough. A recent university partnership. It’s all about re-contextualizing our industrial heritage within a wider global framework. Shows that even our local history didn’t happen in a vacuum.” She was quoting the preface to the report, Alex realised. She was repeating the lie’s own marketing material.

His phone buzzed discreetly in his hand. He held his breath, risking a glance at the screen. It was Arthur. The message was short, almost curt, but it was a bolt of pure, factual lightning. *‘Nonsense. Eades was a Quaker. Vocal abolitionist. Published three pamphlets against the slave trade. Have them here. His shipping company only traded with the northern colonies. Check my notes on the Wolverhampton Abolition Society, Box 7B.’* It was more than Alex could have hoped for. It wasn’t just that the lie was wrong; it was the diametric opposite of the truth. Lyron, in his arrogance, hadn’t just invented a crime; he had pinned it on a man who had actively fought against it.

A cold, exhilarating calm settled over Alex. He had the weapon. Now he had to use it without revealing his source or his magical ring. He let the Curator pick up the new plaque, his silence making her hesitate. “Is something wrong?” she asked. “No, not at all,” Alex said, his voice now level and thoughtful. “It’s just… you mentioned Thomas Eades, and it sparked a memory. I was doing some personal research in the City Archives just the other day. On the Quaker community in 18th-century Wolverhampton. I’m sure I read that Thomas Eades was a prominent member of the local Abolition Society. That he published pamphlets condemning the slave trade. It seems… odd, that he’d be involved in it himself.”

He delivered the lines not as an accusation, but as a point of genuine confusion, the humble amateur historian stumbling upon a contradiction that the professional might be able to clear up. He watched her face. The Curator’s brow furrowed. The name ‘Abolition Society’ had snagged on her professional conscience. It was a verifiable fact, a piece of data that didn't align with the narrative she was about to install. “That’s… I wasn’t aware of that,” she said slowly. The new plaque in her hands suddenly felt heavier, its authority becoming a burden. “The research for this came from the university liaison. It was peer-reviewed.”

“I’m sure it was,” Alex said, pressing his advantage gently. “It’s probably a different Thomas Eades. A common name, I suppose. Still. It would be a terrible thing to confuse the two, wouldn’t it? To accuse a man who fought against slavery of being a beneficiary of it?” The moral weight of the question hung in the air between them. He had handed her a narrative grenade. If she installed the plaque and he was right, her professional reputation, and the museum’s, would be shredded. If he was wrong, she could dismiss him as a crank later. But the risk was too great.

She stared at the plaque, then at Alex, then back at the scarred, silent anvil. He could see the war behind her eyes: the desire to complete her task versus the fundamental curatorial duty to accuracy. The duty won. With a sigh of profound frustration, she placed the new plaque face-down on the bottom shelf of the cart. “I can’t put this up,” she said, as much to herself as to him. “Not until I’ve cross-referenced the source material with the city records. I’ll have to put in a query with the acquisitions department.” She looked at Alex, her expression a mixture of annoyance and grudging respect. “Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It’s always good when the public takes an active interest.”

Alex simply nodded, a wave of dizzying relief washing over him. He hadn’t destroyed the lie. He had merely delayed it, tangled it in the red tape of its own supposed legitimacy. But it was enough. The immediate threat was neutralized. He watched as the Curator, her schedule now thoroughly disrupted, lowered the heavy glass case back over the First Anvil, entombing it once more in its protective shield. The deep, foundational hum of the anvil’s truth felt steady and secure again. Alex turned and walked away, melting back into the sparse crowd of museum-goers. He had won another battle. But as he walked out of the museum's grand entrance and back into the grey light of a Wolverhampton afternoon, he knew with chilling certainty that Lyron’s patience was at an end. The attacks had grown more direct, more personal, more vicious with each failure. There would be no more clever, subtle lies. The Whispering Prince had been thwarted three times. The next attack would not be a whisper. It would be a scream.The victory at the museum was a sour, curdled thing. Alex walked out into the city’s grey embrace feeling not triumphant, but exposed. Each success, each parried blow, had only served to map the battlefield more clearly for his enemy. Lyron now knew who his opponents were. He knew about the stubborn archivist, the passionate DJ, the sharp-eyed curator, and the quiet prince with the silver ring. The game of whispers and secrets was over. Alex could feel it in the air, a barometric drop in the city’s narrative pressure. He walked through streets that were suddenly too quiet, past faces that seemed too calm. It was the held breath before a lightning strike, the unnatural stillness before the storm breaks.

He dreaded returning to the tower block. The thought of facing the empty space where his mother’s belief in him used to be was a more terrifying prospect than any of Lyron’s monsters. When he let himself into his nan’s flat, the silence was a confirmation of his fears. The spilled tea had been cleaned up, the mugs washed and put away, but the psychic stain remained. His mother was gone, back to her own house, to a world she was determined to keep simple and safe, even if it meant shutting him out of it. Elara was sitting by the window, not looking out at the view, but staring at her own reflection in the darkening glass. She didn't turn when he entered.

“She’ll come back,” Elara said, her voice thin and weary. “The world can only be simple for so long. Eventually, the story finds everyone.” She finally turned to face him, and the fatigue in her eyes had been replaced by a sharp, glittering intensity. “I can’t feel his whispers anymore, Alex. He’s gone quiet. The web is still, but it is stretched taut, vibrating with potential. He’s done with cleverness. He’s gathering all his strength, all the fear and doubt and anger he has cultivated, for a single, direct blow. He’s not going to tell a story. He’s going to scream one.”

The moment hung in the air, dense and final. This was the endgame. All the previous skirmishes felt like a prelude, a testing of the defences before the full-scale assault. Alex’s hand instinctively went to his phone, the smooth, cold rectangle that was both his connection to this war and his tether to the mundane world. He stood beside his nan, and together they looked out at the city as evening began to fall. The streetlights flickered on, a familiar, comforting cascade of orange that suddenly felt fragile, like candles in a gale. They were waiting. The whole city was waiting, and it didn't even know it.

It happened at 6:23 PM. It came not as a creeping dread or a spreading rumour, but as a universal, electronic shriek. In pubs and buses, in kitchens and living rooms, on bedside tables and in the hands of pedestrians, every phone in the city vibrated and chimed with the harsh, dissonant tone of a national emergency alert. Alex’s own phone buzzed against his leg with vicious intensity. He pulled it out. The screen was stark red. The text was simple, brutal, and lethally precise. It read: *‘EMERGENCY ALERT: WOLVERHAMPTON. SEVERE STRUCTURAL FAILURE DETECTED IN M6 MOTORWAY SUPPORT PILLARS AT JUNCTION 10. IMMINENT COLLAPSE. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.’*

For a split second, Alex stared at the words, his brain refusing to process them. Then he felt the lie. It was not a subtle, greasy thread. It was a tidal wave of pure, weaponised panic, a raw broadcast of terror designed to obliterate all rational thought. It was a narrative hammer blow, aimed directly at the city's primal fear of being trapped. He looked out of the window. The effect was instantaneous. Below them, the steady, rhythmic flow of traffic on the Ring Road shattered. Brake lights flared in a panicked chain reaction. Horns began to blare, a cacophony of fear. People were spilling out of shops, their faces pale masks of disbelief and terror, phones held up as if they were talismans. Lyron hadn't just screamed a story; he had given the city a command: Flee.

His phone rang, its cheerful ringtone a shocking contrast to the alert on its screen. It was Jaz. He answered, and her voice was a frantic, breathless torrent. “Alex! It’s everywhere! I’m getting calls, people are losing their minds! It’s a hoax, it has to be, but it looks so real! The official channels aren’t saying anything! What do I do? What do I tell them?” She was at the centre of the storm, the one person with a microphone big enough to be heard over the rising tide of panic.

Elara was already moving, her earlier fatigue burned away by the crisis. She grabbed the heavy leather ledger from the chest, her face a grim mask of concentration. “This is it. The panic is the point. He wants the city to devour itself. Gridlock. Accidents. A stampede born from a lie. You can't fight the fear head-on, Alex. You must give them a stronger story. A story of calm. A story of truth.” Her words were the eye of the hurricane, a point of absolute clarity in the swirling chaos. Alex’s mind, which had been frozen in shock, suddenly kicked into gear. He had his allies. He had the truth. He had to deploy them.

He held the phone tight to his ear. “Jaz, stay on the line. I’m getting you a fact.” Without breaking stride, he dialled Arthur Gable’s number, a number he had insisted on getting after the museum. It rang twice before the archivist’s dry, steady voice answered. “Gable.” There was no panic in his voice, only a faint, irritated curiosity. “Arthur, it’s Alex. The emergency alert. Is it real?” Alex asked, his words sharp and clipped. There was a pause, and Alex could hear the faint sound of typing. “Of course not,” Arthur said, his tone one of deep offense, as if the very idea was an insult to a well-ordered world. “The protocol for a Grade One alert requires triple-channel verification from the Highways Agency, COBRA, and local gold command. It would be preceded by a media blackout and the deployment of emergency services. This is a crude, albeit effective, forgery. The pillars at Junction 10 were stress-tested a month ago. I have the report. They are perfectly sound.”

It was the ammunition he needed. A hard, verifiable, bureaucratic fact. The perfect antidote to a lie. He switched his focus back to Jaz. “Jaz, are you listening? It’s a confirmed hoax. A forgery. Arthur Gable at the Archives confirms the protocols are wrong and the pillars are sound. You have to get on the air. Right now. Tell them. ‘Authorities have confirmed the alert is a malicious hoax.’ Use that exact phrase. Don’t speculate. Don’t explain. Just state the fact. Repeat it over and over. You are the voice of calm. You are the only official-sounding voice they will hear. Go. Now.” He heard her take a deep, steadying breath. “On it,” she said, and the line went dead.

He looked out the window again. The chaos was spreading, a virus of panic. The gridlock was becoming absolute. He could see people abandoning their cars, trying to run. But he had fired his first shot. In a few moments, Jaz’s voice would be pouring out of car radios and shop sound systems, a counter-narrative of calm battling the scream of the lie. But he knew it wasn’t enough. The lie was a tidal wave on the narrative plane, and Jaz’s broadcast was just a single lifeboat. He had to do more. He had to face the storm himself.

He turned from the window and looked at his nan. She simply nodded, a deep, knowing understanding in her eyes. This was the moment his entire life, and the lives of all the princes before him, had been leading to. He wasn't a call centre agent or a clumsy historian anymore. He was the city’s final line of defence. He walked back to the window, the vast panorama of his wounded, panicking city spread out before him. He placed his hand, the hand with the silver ring, flat against the cold glass. The window was no longer just a window; it was his amplifier. He closed his eyes, ignoring the cacophony from the streets below, and listened. He felt the raw, screaming power of Lyron’s lie, a hurricane of pure terror ripping through the city’s soul. And beneath it, small but defiant, he felt the golden threads of Jaz’s broadcast, a fragile net of truth. He had to strengthen that net. He took a deep breath, and for the first time, he didn’t just listen for the truth. He began to broadcast it. He poured the memory of every small, resilient, stubborn Wolverhampton story he knew into the ring. The taste of mince and onions, the roar of the Molineux crowd, the rhythm of the factory machines, the quiet dignity of the First Anvil. He gathered it all, a lifetime of truth, and pushed it out through the glass, a steady, silent, defiant hum to counter the scream.It was not a thought process. It was an act of pure, desperate instinct. The city’s panic was a physical force against the glass, a wave of shrieking, terrified energy that threatened to shatter not just the window, but his mind. Alex pushed back. He didn’t know how, but he felt the power of the ring, no longer just a passive amplifier but an active transmitter, drawing on the deepest parts of him. He pushed out the memory of his mum’s quiet competence in a crisis, the solid weight of Arthur’s historical certainty, the fierce loyalty in Jaz’s voice. He broadcast the stubborn, unyielding hum of the First Anvil, the foundational note of a city that had been making things, breaking things, and enduring for centuries. A low, golden hum began to emanate from the window, a silent, steady bass note pushing against the screeching treble of the lie.

Down below, the effect was infinitesimal, but real. A driver who was about to abandon his car and run hesitated, a flicker of doubt cutting through his terror. A woman crying hysterically into her phone suddenly found the breath to listen to the person on the other end. And from dozens of radios, Jaz’s voice began to cut through the static, a lifeline of sanity. ‘…authorities have confirmed the alert is a malicious hoax… repeat, the alert is a malicious hoax…’ Her words were the golden threads, and Alex’s broadcast was the light illuminating them, giving them strength and reach. The two forces, the spoken fact and the felt truth, began to weave a net, a fragile but growing canopy of calm over the epicentre of the chaos.

Then Lyron noticed him. The screaming, diffuse red tide of the city’s panic, which had been spreading outwards, suddenly recoiled and coalesced. It formed a single, malevolent spear of narrative force, aimed directly at the twelfth floor of the tower block. The pressure against the window intensified a hundredfold, and Alex felt a mind-crushing impact, as if a psychic battering ram had struck him. The quiet hum of his broadcast faltered, and Lyron’s voice, no longer a whisper but a triumphant, intimate roar, flooded his mind. *There you are, my little prince of rust and rain. You think you can stop this? You? A boy who sells broadband and couldn't even convince his own mother to believe him?* The words were hooks, baited with his deepest insecurities. *They are all going to die down there, crushed in their own stupid panic, and it will be because you were too weak to save them. You are nothing.*

Alex cried out, stumbling back from the window, his hand falling away. The golden light flickered and died. The pressure was gone, but in its place was a chilling void of despair. The horns outside swelled again, the net of calm tearing under the renewed assault of the lie. He was failing. He was nothing. The story was too strong. “I can’t,” he gasped, his legs giving way, slumping against the wall. “It’s too much.” Elara was there in an instant, not helping him up, but kneeling in front of him, her hands gripping his shoulders with a wiry strength that belied her age. Her eyes were not soft with sympathy; they were blazing with fierce, urgent command. “Stop listening to him!” she hissed. “He’s using your story against you. So use theirs. It’s not just your memory, Alex. It’s not just our line. It’s all of them! Listen to them! Down there! They are fighting too! You are not their prince to command them. You are their prince to serve them. Be their voice!”

Her words were a slap, a splash of cold water. *Use theirs.* He had been fighting for the city, but he had been fighting alone, using his own limited arsenal of truth. He had to be more than a broadcaster. He had to be a conduit. He pushed himself back to the window, the floor-to-ceiling glass now a terrifying portal to the maelstrom. He pressed his hand back to the glass, the cold a shocking jolt. He ignored Lyron’s mocking laughter in his head and did the hardest thing he had ever done. He stopped pushing. He opened himself up. He listened.

He plunged his senses into the chaos, past the surface layer of fear, and felt for the city’s real heartbeat. And he found it. It was faint, but it was there, in a thousand different places. He felt the stubborn grit of a lorry driver, standing by his rig, refusing to abandon his cargo, his hand resting on the flank of his truck like it was a living thing. He felt the focused, ice-cold calm of a paramedic, ignoring the chaos around her as she spoke steadily into her radio, coordinating a response to a fender-bender. He felt the grumbling determination of a thousand people stuck in the gridlock, their initial panic already curdling into a familiar, resolute sense of annoyance. It was a feeling he knew in his bones. It was the feeling of being late for tea, of missing the start of the match, of a Tuesday that had just got a whole lot more complicated. It was the collective, city-wide sigh of ‘Oh, for God’s sake.’

This was the truth. The real story. The people of Wolverhampton didn't stampede. They tutted. They got on with it. He grabbed hold of that feeling, that vast, collective narrative of stubborn, unglamorous endurance. He was no longer broadcasting his own memories. He was pulling their strength, their stories, into himself and amplifying them through the ring. He became a lens, focusing the city’s own defiant spirit back onto itself. The golden hum returned, not as a single note, but as a vast, complex chord, a chorus of a million resilient souls. It wasn’t a story of princes and magic; it was a story of getting the kids from school, of clocking in for a night shift, of making sure the dog got its walk. Lyron’s grand narrative of apocalyptic terror couldn’t compete. It was too dramatic, too cinematic. It wasn’t Wolverhampton rain; it was a Hollywood blockbuster, and in the face of the city’s gritty, mundane reality, it began to look faintly ridiculous.

The golden light exploded outwards from the tower block, not as a gentle hum, but as a wave of pure, undeniable truth. It swept down the Ring Road, across the estates, through the town centre. It didn’t just counter the lie; it subsumed it, invalidated it. The red tide of panic didn’t just recede; it evaporated, sizzling into nothing against the sheer, bloody-minded normality of the city’s response. Down below, the blaring horns sputtered out one by one. People looked around, blinking, as if waking from a strange, shared dream. A man who had been shouting into his phone suddenly looked embarrassed, muttering an apology and getting back in his car. The collective fever broke. The tension that had seized the city snapped, replaced by a grumbling, sheepish sense of anticlimax. The emergency was over.

In the flat, Alex felt the connection to Lyron sever. The voice in his head was gone, replaced by a profound, ringing silence. The strength he had been channelling, the collective will of the entire city, drained away, leaving him utterly, devastatingly empty. His legs buckled, and this time Elara caught him, his dead weight slumping against her tiny, unyielding frame. He was vaguely aware of being guided to the sofa, of his nan’s cool hand on his forehead. The war for the city had been won. But as darkness rushed in at the edge of his vision, he knew, with a final, chilling certainty, that the war with the man who started it was far from over. Lyron had lost his army. Now, all he had left was himself.The world returned to him not in a rush, but in slow, painful layers. First came the ache, a deep, cellular exhaustion that made his bones feel like they were made of lead. Then came sound, the gentle clink of a spoon against china and the low, distant rumble of traffic, a rhythm that was blessedly, beautifully normal. He opened his eyes. The ceiling of his nan’s living room was a familiar landscape of faint cracks, and the light filtering through the window was the weak, pearlescent grey of a Wolverhampton morning. He was on the sofa, a thick woollen blanket tucked around him. Elara was sitting in her armchair, calmly stirring a cup of tea, her movements as deliberate and steady as if the previous night had never happened.

But it had. The memory flooded back, a phantom echo of the screaming panic, the crushing weight of Lyron’s despair, and the final, exhilarating, terrifying surge of the city’s collective, stubborn soul. He had been a conduit for a million lives, and the experience had scoured him clean, leaving him feeling thin and transparent. He pushed himself up, his muscles protesting with a groan, and the silver ring on his finger felt as much a part of him as his own knuckle, its weight familiar and constant.

“Don’t try to get up too quickly,” Elara said, her voice even. “You channelled a city’s worth of pure, undiluted stubbornness. It’s more draining than you’d think. There’s tea on the side for you. Strong.” He reached for the mug, his hand trembling slightly. The simple, hot, sweet liquid was the most real thing he had ever tasted. He drank it down, the warmth spreading through him, a temporary patch on the profound hollowness inside. He looked towards the window, half-expecting to see the residue of the battle, some lingering stain on the sky, but there was nothing. Just another Wednesday.

He fumbled for his phone, the modern reflex for making sense of the world. The screen was no longer a portal to a battlefield of lies. The #WolvesBlight hashtag was a dead echo. The trending topics were about football transfers and a scandal on a reality TV show. The Great Panic Hoax of the previous evening was the lead story on every national news site, but the narrative was already setting like concrete, cool and rational. The official story, crafted in press releases and government statements, spoke of a ‘highly sophisticated, malicious cyber-attack’ exploiting a ‘previously unknown vulnerability’ in the national alert network. Experts were quoted, speculating about foreign state actors and rogue hacker groups. There was no mention of a Whispering Prince or a war of stories. The truth, in all its impossible, magical reality, had been safely paved over by a more convenient, technological explanation. The world had tidied itself up.

His phone buzzed with a message from Jaz. *‘They’re calling me the Voice of Calm. The BBC wants an interview. It’s insane. I told them I was just doing my job. How are you? Did we… win?’* Alex typed back a simple response. *‘We did. You were brilliant. Just get some rest.’* He felt a surge of warmth for his new, unlikely allies. Arthur had probably already catalogued the event under ‘Anomalous Information Dissemination Events’, and the Curator was no doubt diligently cross-referencing her sources, her belief in factual accuracy now unshakeable. They had held the line.

He looked up at his nan, who was watching him with an unnerving stillness. “It’s over, then,” Alex said, the words feeling hollow even as he said them. “He’s gone. We won.” Elara took a slow sip of her tea before answering. “We won the battle for Wolverhampton,” she corrected him softly. “But we have not won the war with Lyron. We’ve done something far more dangerous. We’ve cornered him.” She placed her cup down with a delicate click. “Think, Alex. We have dismantled his power base piece by piece. His horror story was erased by truth. His political lie was disproven by fact. His song of apathy was drowned out by the city’s own noise. And last night, his grand symphony of terror was shattered by the very people he sought to control. He has no army left. He has no grand canvas on which to paint his lies. All he has is his own rage, and a single, burning focus of blame.”

A cold dread, separate from his exhaustion, began to creep into the room. “Me,” Alex said. It wasn’t a question. “You,” Elara confirmed, her gaze unwavering. “He doesn't want the city anymore. It has rejected him. He wants the satisfaction of destroying the one who led the resistance. The little Prince of Penn who refused to bow. He will not try to trick you with a story or fool you with a rumour. He will come for you directly, with all the power he has left. He will seek to end your story, personally.” The finality in her voice was absolute. This was no longer a secret war fought in the shadows of archives and radio studios. It had become a duel.

The summons came in the early afternoon. It was not a phone call or a message. It was a scar, a wound that opened suddenly in Alex’s perception of the city. He was standing by the window, watching the endless, unremarkable flow of traffic, when a specific point in the landscape, down towards the dark, serpentine line of the canal, flared with a nauseating, violet-black light that only he could see. It was the same spot as the first blight, the towpath by the old works, the place where it had all begun. It was a beacon of pure, concentrated malevolence, a psychic rip in the fabric of his home. And from it, he felt a clear, cold, unambiguous thought, a message aimed directly at him, spoken in Lyron’s true, venomous voice. *Come and face me, Prince. Or I will come to your tower. I will pull it down brick by brick, story by story, until there is nothing left of your line but rubble and a bad memory. End this. Now.*

He felt the threat like a physical blow, a violation that made his skin crawl. It was not a bluff. Lyron had been defeated, but he was still powerful enough to unmake things, to focus his remaining spite into a single act of devastating destruction. He could not be ignored. Alex turned from the window, his exhaustion gone, burned away by a cold, clear certainty. He had to go. Elara was standing behind him, her hand resting on the back of her armchair, her face pale but resolute. She had felt it too. She knew. There were no more words of advice, no ancient lore to impart. They had reached the end of the ledger.

“I have to go,” he said, the words a simple statement of fact. “Yes,” she said, her voice impossibly steady. He walked towards the door, feeling strangely calm. He was no longer Alex the call centre agent, or even Alex the reluctant prince. He was just a man walking out to face the consequences of his choices. As he reached for the door handle, Elara’s voice stopped him. “Alex.” He turned. She was holding out her hand. In her palm lay a single, small, porcelain bird—a wren, its form captured in a moment of defiant song. “The city is with you,” she said. “But don’t forget to have a story of your own.” He took the small, fragile object. Its smooth, cool surface felt solid and real in his hand. He slipped it into the pocket of his jacket, the tiny weight a secret, personal truth. Then he walked out of the door, and down to the street, to go and meet the Whispering Prince.The walk to the canal was the strangest journey of his life. He moved through a city that was utterly oblivious, a city meticulously going about the business of a normal Wednesday afternoon. Buses wheezed past, shoppers bustled with bags, and the air was filled with the mundane symphony of traffic and distant sirens. No one looked at him twice. He was just another young man in a hoodie, walking with a grim set to his jaw. He felt invisible, yet at the same time, the entire city felt like it was holding its breath just for him. The air was clear of Lyron’s static, the greasy threads of his lies wiped clean, but this new silence was more unnerving. It was the focused, unnerving silence of a stage waiting for its final act. He needed no directions; he was pulled towards the canal by a cold, invisible tether, a single point of profound wrongness in an otherwise placid world.

As he neared the old works, the world began to change. The temperature dropped by ten degrees in the space of a single street. The cheerful urban clatter faded away, replaced by a low, humming silence that felt like the absence of sound itself. He stepped onto the towpath, and it was like stepping into another country. The sky overhead was a bruised, sickly purple, the clouds hanging low and heavy as if the heavens themselves were pressing down on this one blighted spot. The water in the canal was no longer just black; it was a perfect, light-devouring void, a sheet of polished nothingness. The creeping mould on the bridge was gone. In its place, the Victorian brickwork was simply… erased. It was being unmade, smoothed over into a featureless, glistening black substance that reflected nothing. This was not a wound on the world. It was a hole in it, a patch of reality that Lyron had claimed and was actively deleting.

He was standing there, under the arch of the bridge, a place where shadow and decay were absolute. He was not a monster. He was not a roaring demon or a shadowy spectre. He was a man. He wore a suit that was expensive but forgettable, in a shade of charcoal grey that seemed to absorb the light around it. His hair was perfectly styled, his shoes were immaculately polished, and his face was handsome in a completely generic, unmemorable way. He looked like an estate agent, or a management consultant, or a man in a stock photograph labelled ‘success’. He was the embodiment of plausible emptiness. This was the Whispering Prince. He offered Alex a polite, sterile smile that did not reach his cold, ancient eyes.

“Alex,” Lyron said, his voice not a whisper, but a calm, reasonable, conversational tone that was more chilling than any roar. “The Prince of Penn. Welcome. I thought it fitting we end our little story where it began.” He gestured with a perfectly manicured hand at the unmaking world around them. “This is what happens when stories are proven false, you see. They cease to exist. All the effort, the craft… it just comes undone. A pity, really.” His gaze settled on Alex, the polite smile tightening into something predatory. “And your story, Prince Alex, is the falsest of them all. Shall we unpick it together?”

The attack was not a physical blow, but a precise, surgical dissection of his soul. Every word Lyron spoke landed with the force of a revealed truth, stripping away the thin, borrowed confidence Alex had acquired. “A prince?” Lyron scoffed, a soft, devastating sound. “You are a boy who reads a script for eight hours a day, convincing lonely people to buy things they don’t need. Your greatest ambition was to maybe, one day, afford a deposit on a flat where you could be lonely in private. This,” he waved a hand at Alex’s hoodie, at the silver ring, “is a costume. A fantasy you let an old woman spin for you because your own life was a beige-coloured, drizzly, Wolverhampton-grey hell.” The blight on the walls seemed to pulse in time with Lyron’s words, the black, featureless void creeping an inch closer, drawn by Alex's own surging self-doubt. The strength of the city felt a million miles away. This was just him. And he was beginning to believe he was nothing.

Lyron’s voice was relentless, a scalpel carving away layers of identity. “Your own mother looks at you with fear. She doesn’t believe you. She chose the real world, the world of common sense and shopping lists, over your fairy tales. Your friends, had you any left, would have you committed. You stand here, a pretender in a borrowed story, trying to save a city that wouldn’t even notice if you vanished. You are a footnote. An error. A character with no arc.” With every sentence, Alex felt himself shrinking, the grand narrative of the last few days dissolving into a pathetic, delusional episode. He was just Alex. The Alex who sat on the top deck of the number 5 bus, watching the grey city slide by, his soul being nibbled away by feigned enthusiasm. That was the truth. That was all there was. The cold of the towpath began to seep into his bones, a profound emptiness that promised a final, peaceful surrender.

His hand, hanging limp by his side, brushed against the pocket of his jacket. He felt a small, hard shape inside. The porcelain wren. It was not a magical artifact. It was not a symbol of his royal line. It was just a little thing his nan had given him. A story of his own. The thought was a tiny spark in the overwhelming darkness of Lyron’s narrative. He wrapped his fingers around it, its smooth, fragile solidity a point of absolute reality in this unmaking world. He looked up at Lyron, the perfect, empty man in the perfect, empty suit, and for the first time, he saw him for what he was. He was a critic, a deconstructionist, a being who could only unmake because he had never made anything himself. Alex, on the other hand, had a life. It was a messy, imperfect, often disappointing life. But it was his.

“You’re right,” Alex said, and his voice, though quiet, did not tremble. The admission seemed to surprise Lyron, whose sterile smile faltered for a fraction of a second. “I do work in a call centre. I do sit on the bus and scroll through my phone. My mum is angry with me, and I spend most of my time feeling… lost. You’re right. That is my story. It’s not a grand epic. It’s not very princely. It’s just a bit… real.” As he spoke, he accepted it all. The boredom, the apathy, the quiet desperation. He owned it. It was not a weakness. It was his foundation. He took a step forward, the porcelain bird a secret strength in his hand. “The thing is, a real story has details. It has grit. It has the smell of mince and onions, and the feeling of a damp bus seat, and the weight of a disappointing Tuesday. It has love, and it has fear. I love my mum and my nan. I was scared for my city.” He looked Lyron directly in the eye, the polite mask falling away to reveal the void beneath. “What are your details, Lyron? What does your house smell like? Who’s your mum? What Tuesday broke your heart? You don’t have a story. You’re just a hole where one should be.”

The truth of it hit Lyron with the force of a physical apocalypse. The Prince of Lies, the weaver of narratives, had no narrative of his own. He was a parasite, existing only in the doubts and fears he could cultivate in others. He was nothing. The handsome, generic face twisted, not in anger, but in a sudden, profound terror. His form began to waver, the edges of his expensive suit blurring like smoke. He opened his mouth, but no sound came out, for he had no voice of his own, only the echoes of other people’s whispers. The solid ground of Alex’s mundane, flawed, utterly authentic reality was a truth so profound it was unmaking him.

He did not scream. He did not explode. He simply came undone. The suit, the shoes, the perfectly styled hair, all dissolved into a cloud of grey, meaningless dust that smelled of static and forgotten paper. The dust hung in the air for a moment, a question mark, and then was simply gone, leaving nothing behind. As he vanished, the world rushed back in. The black, featureless void on the bridge recoiled like a burned thing, the familiar, scarred, red brickwork underneath reappearing in an instant. The obsidian water of the canal shattered back into its normal, murky brown, a ripple spreading across its surface as a moorhen paddled out from under the arch. And through the heavy, purple clouds, a single, determined ray of sunlight broke through, striking the towpath and bathing it in a weak but honest golden light.

Alex stood alone, his breath misting in the suddenly cool, clean air. The exhaustion that hit him was monumental, a debt of energy called in from every cell in his body. But beneath it, he felt solid. He was not a prince. He was not just a call centre agent. He was Alex. He was the man who had faced down the void by admitting he was bored on a Tuesday. He slowly opened his hand and looked at the porcelain wren. It was whole. He smiled, a real, tired smile, and slipped it back into his pocket. He turned his back on the canal and started the long, slow walk home.The walk home was a pilgrimage through the mundane, and every ordinary detail was a miracle. A bus wheezed past, its windows steamed up, and Alex saw not a vessel of his former despair, but a capsule of stories, each passenger carrying a universe of triumphs and anxieties within them. The sky, a classic Wolverhampton ceiling of bruised cloud, felt not oppressive but familiar, a soft grey blanket tucked over the city he had fought for. He was so tired he felt he could dissolve into the pavement, but it was a good, clean exhaustion, the feeling of a job truly finished. He could still feel the threads of the city through the ring on his finger, but the perception had changed. They were no longer a complex web he had to navigate or defend; they were just the quiet, golden hum of life being lived. He felt the steady rhythm of a nurse’s commute, the bright, anxious flicker of a student heading for an exam, the warm, slow pulse of an old couple walking their dog. He was no longer a prince overseeing his domain; he was just another thread in the weave, and the feeling was not one of diminishment, but of belonging.

He stopped outside his own house, the familiar brick terrace with his mum’s lovingly tended garden now looking like a sanctuary. He hesitated, his hand on the gate, the memory of her fearful, ultimatum-giving face a fresh wound. He didn’t know what he would say, how he could possibly explain the unexplainable. Taking a breath that felt like it was his first in days, he opened the door. The smell hit him instantly, a smell so potent with memory and love that it almost brought him to his knees: roast chicken. It was the smell of Sunday afternoons, of Christmas, of forgiveness. Sandra was standing at the counter, her back to him, her shoulders tense. She didn’t turn around, but he knew she’d heard him.

“Your dinner’s in the oven,” she said, her voice tight, trying for her usual brusque tone and failing. “I didn’t want it to get cold.” He walked into the kitchen and just stood there, a silent spectator in his own life. Finally, she turned, a tea towel twisted in her hands, and her face was a ruin of sleeplessness and worry. She looked at him, her gaze sweeping over him, checking for injuries both visible and invisible. She didn’t ask where he’d been or what he’d done. She just saw him, whole and safe, the frantic, haunted look gone from his eyes, replaced by a deep, settled weariness. And that was enough. Her carefully constructed wall of anger and fear crumbled.

“Oh, Al,” she breathed, and she crossed the small kitchen in two steps, wrapping her arms around him in a fierce, trembling hug. She held on as if she was afraid he might dissolve like smoke. “I’m sorry,” she whispered into his shoulder, her voice thick with tears. “I’m so sorry. I was scared. I didn’t understand, and I was scared. I shouldn’t have… I’m sorry.” He hugged her back, burying his face in the familiar scent of her cardigan, feeling the solid, undeniable truth of her embrace. She didn’t need to understand. She just needed him to be home. The story didn’t matter as much as the people in it.

Later, full of roast chicken and potatoes, a meal that felt like it was rebuilding him from the inside out, he went back to the tower block. The lift still groaned its weary complaint, the corridor was still silent, but as he knocked on the door of 2B, he felt a sense of peace, not of duty. When Elara opened the door, she wasn’t the frail, worried woman he had left behind. She was just his nan, her bird-bright eyes crinkling at the corners as she saw him. The flat was quiet, the air of crisis completely gone, replaced by the gentle, familiar scent of lavender and old paper. She didn't offer him tea. She just looked at him, a long, appraising look that saw everything.

“You look different,” she said finally, as he sat on the sofa. “Taller.” He knew it wasn’t literally true, but he understood what she meant. He no longer felt like he was stooping under the weight of a secret. “You didn’t beat him with our family’s story, Alex,” she continued, her voice soft with a profound, quiet pride. “The tales of Mercian princes and ancient lines… that was just the key to the door. You beat him with your own story. The story of a tired young man who works in a call centre and loves his mum. A story that was mundane and flawed and absolutely, undeniably true. He had no defence against that.” She smiled, a real, radiant smile. “The Prince of Penn found his power, in the end. And it had nothing to do with being a prince.”

He looked down at the silver ring on his finger. It no longer felt like a sentence or a weapon. It felt like a part of his own hand. “What happens now?” he asked. “Is it… over?” Elara walked to the window, gazing out at the tapestry of lights that was their city. “Lyron is gone. A story proven false ceases to exist. But there will always be other stories, Alex. New whispers, new fears. The world will never run out of them. But Wolverhampton knows how to fight back now. It has its archivist, its curator, its musician… and you. Your job isn’t to fight a war anymore. It is simply to listen. To hear the true stories, and to remind people of them when they forget.”

He knew she was right. He couldn’t go back. He couldn’t sit in a cubicle and read from a script, not now. The idea was impossible, like trying to squeeze a giant back into a bottle. His life, his real, messy, complicated life, had finally begun. He thought about Jaz, about her offer. He thought about using his strange gift not to fight lies, but to find and share truths. Small stories, real stories. The stories of the people on the bus, in the market, in the factories. The stories that made up the city’s resilient, stubborn soul.

As if on cue, his phone vibrated. It was a text from Jaz. *‘Hey, you. The Voice of Calm is about to go on air in an hour. The city’s feeling a bit… weird and quiet tonight. Got any real stories for me? Something small. Something good.’* He looked at the message, then out of the window at the sprawling, beautiful, ordinary city below. He thought of the porcelain wren in his pocket, a quiet song waiting to be sung. He was still Alex, from Penn. But that was no longer an admission of defeat. It was a statement of fact, and it was the source of all his strength. He began to type, a genuine smile spreading across his face. And for the first time in a very long time, he knew exactly what to say.His thumb hovered over the glowing screen. For a moment, his mind went blank, a repository of grand, unspeakable events. He could tell her about a prince of lies dissolving into dust, or a tower block window holding back a tidal wave of psychic terror. But these weren't the stories that mattered now. They were the mechanics of the war, not its heart. He thought of his nan’s words, *“a story of your own,”* and the realisation that had saved him on the towpath. The power wasn’t in the grand and magical, but in the small and true. He began to type, not a dramatic summary, but a simple observation he had plucked from the chaos of the previous night. ‘There was a lorry driver, an old guy in a flat cap, stuck in the gridlock on the Ring Road. Everyone was running. He just got out of his cab, walked around the side of his truck, and patted its bonnet like it was a nervous horse. Then he lit a cigarette and waited. He wasn’t going anywhere. He had a delivery to make.’

He sent the message and a strange sense of finality washed over him. He had shared a piece of the secret, not as a warning, but as an anecdote. He and Elara sat in a comfortable, tired silence for what felt like a long time. Then, on a shared impulse, Alex took out his phone again, found the WCR FM app, and tapped the ‘Listen Live’ button. The sound of a generic indie-pop song filled the quiet flat. They listened as it faded out, replaced by the familiar, smooth velvet of Jasmine Kaur’s voice. It was different, though. The professional sheen was still there, but underneath it was a new warmth, a resonant note of someone who had looked into the void and chosen to turn the lights back on.

“And that was the latest from The Lathums,” she said. “A good song for a Wednesday night. A night that feels… a little bit strange across the city, doesn’t it? Like we’ve all woken up from a very weird, very loud dream.” There was a pause, the kind of perfect, timed silence that was her signature. “I heard a story today. Just a small one. About the chaos last night. There was a lorry driver out on the Ring Road, stuck fast like everyone else. And while all hell was breaking loose, he just got out of his cab and waited. Stood by his truck as if to say, ‘We’re not going anywhere, old girl. Not till the job’s done.’ I don’t know who he is, but whoever you are, mate, this next one is for you. This is a song about just getting on with it.” The opening chords of a classic Bill Withers track, soulful and reassuring, filled the air.

Alex felt a lump form in his throat. It was the strangest, most profound feeling: his secret knowledge, his private, magical perception, translated into a public moment of shared humanity. It wasn’t a secret anymore; it was an anecdote, a piece of local colour, a story that now belonged to everyone who was listening. He looked at his nan, and she was smiling, a look of pure, unadulterated pride on her face. The Prince of Penn had just made his first broadcast, not as a warrior, but as a witness. He hadn’t shouted a warning; he had shared a truth, and it had been woven seamlessly into the city’s ongoing song.

In that quiet moment, listening to the music drift from his phone, a final piece of his old life fell away. He thought of the call centre, of the headset waiting for him, of the script lying on the desk. He thought of the feigned enthusiasm, the beige-coloured hell, the slow, steady erosion of his voice. The idea of returning to it was not just unappealing; it was a physical impossibility. He could no more go back to that life than a butterfly could return to its chrysalis. He stood up, walked into the small hallway, and picked up his jacket. He took out his wallet, found a crumpled business card, and dialled the number for his line manager.

The phone was answered on the third ring by a harried, perpetually annoyed voice. “Dave speaking.” It was the voice of a man drowning in spreadsheets and performance metrics. “Hi, Dave. It’s Alex.” He could almost hear Dave’s eyes rolling. “Alex. Right. Your shift started half an hour ago. Let me guess, your nan’s had another turn? What is it this time? Is the cat sick? We’re going to need a doctor’s note for this one, mate, I’m telling you now.” The litany of cynical complaints washed over Alex, but for the first time, it had no power. It was just noise.

“Actually, Dave,” Alex said, and his own voice sounded different in his ears, calmer, clearer, with no trace of apology or excuse. “I’m calling to let you know that I won’t be coming in. Not today. Not ever.” There was a stunned silence on the other end of the line. Dave was so used to scripts, both his own and his employees’, that a simple, direct statement of fact had short-circuited him. “You’re… what? You’re quitting? You can’t just quit over the phone, Alex, there’s a procedure. You have to fill in the HR-7B form, give your two weeks’ notice…” Alex smiled. It was a small, genuine smile. Of course there was a form. There was always a form. “No, Dave,” he said, the words feeling cleaner and truer than anything he had ever been paid to say. “I don’t think I do. Goodbye.” He ended the call before Dave could protest, and then he deleted the number from his contacts. The last chain had been broken.

He walked out of the tower block and into the arms of the city. He had no job. He had no plan. His savings would barely last a month. He was, by any sensible measure, completely adrift. But he had never felt more grounded. He walked without purpose, not towards a bus stop or a destination, but simply through the streets of his home. The ring on his finger was no longer a lens for seeing lies, but a focus for perceiving truths. He passed a group of teenagers laughing by a chip shop, and he felt the fierce, fragile golden thread of their friendship. He saw an old man carefully tending the roses in his small front garden and felt the slow, deep, patient story of a lifetime spent in one place. He heard a mother singing softly to her child in a pushchair and felt the fierce, protective pulse of a love that was its own kind of magic. This was his new job. One without a script, a salary, or a form HR-7B. He was a listener. A collector. A quiet guardian of the small, mundane, beautiful stories that kept the darkness at bay. He was Alex of Wolverhampton, and he was finally home.
