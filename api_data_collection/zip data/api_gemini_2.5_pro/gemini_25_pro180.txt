The sky over Leeds had a habit of looking like bruised fruit, all mottled purples and sullen greys, even on days the weather forecast promised sunshine. Eleanor Vance had always found a sort of grim comfort in it. It was a writer’s sky, a sky that didn’t demand cheerfulness but offered a backdrop for introspection. On this particular Tuesday, however, the bruised quality seemed less poetic and more like a personal threat, a heavy lid pressing down on the city. She stood on the corner of Briggate, clutching the strap of her satchel, waiting for Marcus. He was, as ever, seven minutes late. Punctuality, for Marcus, was a theoretical concept, something for lesser mortals to worry about.

Eleanor shifted her weight, the worn leather of her boots comfortable on the paving stones. She was thinking about Offa of Mercia, the king at the heart of her current work-in-progress. A man who built a dyke to define his kingdom, to say *this is mine and that is yours*. She understood that impulse. Her own kingdom was a second-floor flat in a converted mill in Holbeck, a place of exposed brick and meticulously curated bookshelves, a space she had carved out of the world where she could control every detail. At least, that’s how it had felt until recently. Now, even her own kingdom felt precarious.

A horn blared and Marcus’s sleek, aggressively silver car slid into a bus stop, earning a furious glare from a waiting driver. Marcus emerged, all expensive suit and unapologetic smile. He was in finance, a world as alien to Eleanor’s as the surface of Mars. He saw the world in spreadsheets and profit margins; she saw it in narratives and buried truths.

"Sorry, darling," he said, kissing the air beside her cheek. "Meeting ran over. You know how it is. We’re going to be late for our reservation."

"What reservation?" Eleanor asked, her brow furrowing. "I thought we were just getting a sandwich from that little place by the Corn Exchange."

"Change of plans! I’ve booked us into Angelica’s. Top of the Trinity. Celebrate the new chapter." He beamed, proud of his spontaneity. He was always trying to 'broaden her horizons', which usually meant dragging her to places that were loud and shiny.

A cold knot formed in Eleanor’s stomach. The top of the Trinity Centre. High up. Very high up. "Oh. Marcus, I don’t know. It’s a bit… fancy for a Tuesday lunchtime."

"Nonsense. A writer of your calibre should be sipping champagne above the rooftops, not hunched over a falafel wrap." He took her arm, his grip firm, proprietary. He propelled her forward, into the gleaming maw of the shopping centre. The noise hit her first, a cacophony of piped-in music, clattering shoppers, and the distant roar of a coffee machine. They ascended on escalators that seemed to climb for an eternity, past floors of shops that blurred into a meaningless smear of brands and logos. With each rising foot, the knot in her stomach tightened. It was a physical thing, a cold, hard stone of dread.

She had first felt it a month ago, on a research trip to Lincoln. She’d climbed the cathedral tower, a thing she’d done a dozen times before, notebook in hand, ready to absorb the ancient stones and the sprawling view. But halfway up the tight spiral staircase, looking down through a narrow arrow-slit window, the world had tilted. The ground, so far below, had seemed to rush up at her. Her heart had hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird trapped in a cage. Her breath had caught in her throat. She’d clung to the cold, damp wall, her knuckles white, convinced that some malevolent force was trying to pull her through the tiny opening and down into the abyss. She’d had to be helped down by a kindly verger, her legs trembling, her face slick with a cold sweat of pure, undiluted terror.

She’d told Marcus about it, of course. He’d dismissed it with a wave of his hand. "Bit of vertigo," he'd said, not looking up from his tablet. "Happens to everyone. You were probably just tired."

But it wasn't just 'a bit of vertigo'. It was a monster. And now, as they stepped into the glass lift that would take them to the rooftop restaurant, the monster was stirring. The lift was a transparent box, shooting upwards alongside the building's exterior. Eleanor squeezed her eyes shut, pressing herself into the corner.

"El, for God's sake, look at the view," Marcus said, his voice laced with that familiar tone of loving exasperation.

She couldn't. She could feel the space, the nothingness, on the other side of the glass. She could feel the city dropping away beneath them. Gravity, she was beginning to realise, wasn't a constant, reliable friend; it was a predator, and it had tasted her. The lift shuddered to a halt and the doors opened onto a chic, minimalist space. To their right, a wall of glass. Beyond it, a terrace. Beyond that, the drop. Leeds lay spread out below them like a map, the red-brick terraces, the dark slash of the railway lines, the toy cars crawling along The Headrow. It was a view she had once loved. Now it made her feel sick.

"Table for Vance," Marcus announced to the hostess, who led them not into the main restaurant, but out onto the terrace. "I asked for the best table," he whispered to Eleanor, squeezing her hand. The best table was at the very edge, separated from the six-storey drop by a pane of thick, clear glass. The sky felt enormous, empty. The wind whipped at her hair, carrying the distant wail of a siren.

Eleanor froze. "Marcus. No. I can't."

"What do you mean, you can't? It's spectacular." He was already pulling out her chair. The chair was metal and modern and felt hopelessly flimsy. The ground wasn't ground. It was a suggestion. A rumour of pavement far below.

"Please," she whispered, her voice tight. "Can we sit inside?" Her heart was doing it again, the frantic bird-beat. The air felt thin, unbreathable. She could feel the hum of the building through the soles of her feet, a deep, resonant vibration that seemed to be shaking the whole structure loose from its foundations.

Marcus sighed, a long, put-upon exhalation that was louder than the wind. "Honestly, El. This again? It's a glass barrier. It's half an inch thick. A truck could hit it and it wouldn't break. You're being irrational."

"I know it's irrational," she said, her voice trembling. The world was starting to swim at the edges. The neat lines of the distant buildings were blurring. "That doesn't mean it isn't real. Please. Let's just sit inside."

Heads were turning. A couple at a nearby table looked over with polite curiosity. Marcus’s face tightened with embarrassment. "Fine," he snapped, his voice low and angry. "Fine. We'll sit inside. Spoil the whole point of coming up here, but fine." He gestured curtly to the hostess, who, with an impassive smile, led them to a table in the centre of the room, far from the windows.

Eleanor sank into the chair, her body shaking. She felt her blood returning to her face, a hot, shameful flush. Marcus sat opposite her, his jaw set, his fingers drumming a furious rhythm on the white tablecloth. He didn't look at her. He looked out at the window, at the view she had rejected.

"You really need to get a grip on this, Eleanor," he said, without turning. "It's becoming an embarrassment."

The words landed like stones. There was no sympathy, no concern. Only judgment. She felt a chasm open between them, a drop far more terrifying than the one from the terrace. She was alone with her monster. He ordered champagne, his voice brittle and cheerful, a performance for the benefit of the waitress. Eleanor stared at her hands, lying still and pale on her lap. She had built a career on understanding the intricacies of the human heart, on exploring fear and courage and the breaking points of the soul. But she couldn't understand this. She couldn't understand how the solid ground beneath her feet had been replaced by a constant, sickening awareness of the abyss. The champagne arrived, and Marcus raised his glass. "To the new chapter," he said, his eyes cold. Eleanor couldn't bring herself to lift her glass. The new chapter, she thought, was already terrifying. It was a chapter where the world she knew was shrinking, and the people she thought she could rely on were turning into strangers.The bubbles in her untouched glass rose and died, a silent, frantic fizzing. Eleanor watched them, feeling a strange kinship with their brief, trapped existence. The restaurant was a bubble of its own, a hushed, climate-controlled pocket of quiet luxury floating above the messy reality of the city. But the quiet was a lie. Underneath the polite murmur of conversation and the clink of expensive cutlery, she could still feel the vibration of the building, the deep, structural hum that told her she was nowhere near the ground. The monster was quiet now, but it was still there, curled in her gut, listening. Marcus took a long, pointed sip of his own champagne, then set the glass down with a decisive click. He was restoring order, performing normality so convincingly he might even believe it himself.

"So," he began, unfolding his napkin and placing it on his lap with crisp precision. "The new chapter. Are you past the part with the rebellion in Kent? That always sounded a bit dry. I hope you're getting to the juicy stuff. The court intrigue, the succession. That's what sells." He was trying to steer them back to a familiar script: Marcus the savvy pragmatist, Eleanor the brilliant but unworldly artist. A script where he was the anchor and she, the kite. But the string had snapped. The kite was either going to plummet or be carried away on a wind he couldn't control.

She thought of the dyke. The great earthen rampart snaking for miles across the landscape. Historians debated its exact purpose—was it a defensive fortification, a trade boundary, or a pure statement of power? For Eleanor, it had always been about the statement. A line drawn in the mud and rock of the world. *Here I am. Here I end. And there, you begin.* She had once thought her love for Marcus was a kingdom without borders, a seamless merging of two territories. Now she saw the flaw in that thinking. A kingdom without borders is not a kingdom; it is a contested land, vulnerable to any and every invasion. His judgment was an invading army, and she had left the gates wide open.

Their food arrived, carried by a waiter who moved with silent, balletic grace. On Eleanor's plate was a delicate construction of seared scallops and micro-herbs, a piece of art that seemed to mock her with its perfection. She picked up her fork, the heavy silver unfamiliar in her hand, and pushed a single pea across the glossy surface of the plate. Her appetite had vanished, consumed by the cold knot of dread and the hotter, sharper sting of humiliation. Across the table, Marcus tucked into his steak with an enthusiasm that felt like a deliberate provocation. He cut, he chewed, he swallowed, a man entirely at home in his own skin, in a world that rewarded his certainties.

He dabbed his mouth with his napkin. "You know," he said, his voice dropping into a tone of reasonable concern that was far more wounding than his earlier anger. "My colleague, Richard, his wife had something like this. Panic attacks. She went to see someone, a therapist. Did some mindfulness course. It sorted her right out. Maybe you should think about it. We can't have you falling apart every time we're more than ten feet off the ground." *We.* The word hung in the air between them. *We* can’t have this. It was a logistical problem, an inconvenient variable in his spreadsheet of a life. Her terror was a line item that was messing up his projections.

Eleanor finally lifted her head and looked at him. She saw the handsome face, the perfectly tailored suit, the easy confidence that had first drawn her to him. But she saw through it now, as if he too were made of glass. She saw the profound, unbridgeable distance between them. He didn't want to understand her fear; he wanted to erase it. He wasn't offering a hand to hold in the dark; he was impatiently demanding she find the light switch. The monster in her stomach was terrible, but this—this casual, unthinking cruelty from the person who was supposed to be her sanctuary—was a deeper kind of horror. The bruised-fruit sky outside the window seemed to press closer, the purples and greys bleeding into one another.

"Maybe," she said, her voice barely a whisper. The single word was a concession, a white flag. But it was not a surrender. It was a tactic. It was the building of a dyke, the first shovelful of earth. She would retreat, for now, back to her own territory, to the kingdom of brick and books where she was still the sovereign. She would go home, and she would begin to draw her lines. The waiter returned to ask if everything was to their satisfaction. Marcus beamed at him, a flash of white teeth. "Perfect," he said, glancing at Eleanor’s full plate with a flicker of annoyance before his smile returned, seamless and impenetrable. "Everything is just perfect."The drive back to Holbeck was a study in silence. Marcus navigated the city’s arteries with tight, jerky movements, a stark contrast to his usual fluid aggression behind the wheel. The sleek silver car, which he polished with a devotion Eleanor had always found faintly ridiculous, felt less like a luxury vehicle and more like a pressurized capsule. She stared out of the passenger window, watching the familiar red-brick buildings slide past. The grim sky was a comfort now, its sullen greys a soft blanket after the hard, empty blue she had been forced to confront. The city at street level was knowable, solid. People walked on pavements, buses rumbled in their lanes, everything connected to the good, solid earth. She felt her breathing deepen, syncing with the rhythm of the traffic lights. She was coming down, not just from a height, but from a state of sheer terror, and the descent left her feeling hollowed out and fragile.

He parked not in a visitor’s space, but in a loading bay right by the main entrance to the converted mill, another minor infraction in a day full of them. He killed the engine and the silence in the car became heavier, freighted with unspoken recriminations. Eleanor didn't wait for him to speak. She unbuckled her seatbelt, grabbed her satchel, and got out, closing the door with a soft, final click. The air, tasting of rain and old industry, filled her lungs. She could feel his eyes on her as she walked towards the heavy glass doors of the entrance, but she didn't look back. The familiar weight of the door, the echo of her boots in the cavernous lobby with its lingering smell of machine oil and dust, the slow, groaning ascent of the industrial lift—it was all part of the ritual of return. Her return to the one place in the world that was unequivocally hers. When she put her key in the lock of her own front door, she felt a profound sense of relief, as if she were a soldier crossing back into friendly territory.

Her flat was her fortress. The main room was a long, open space with a wall of exposed brick that still bore the faint scars of its industrial past. Bookshelves, built by her own hand, lined another wall from floor to ceiling, not arranged by colour for show, but by subject and period, a working library that was the engine room of her mind. Her desk, a vast plain of scarred oak, was covered with maps of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, stacks of research papers, and the open pages of her current manuscript. It was a landscape of organised chaos, and she was its sole monarch. This was her kingdom, her Mercia. She dropped her satchel on the floor, the sound swallowed by the quiet, and stood for a moment, just breathing. She was home. The monster was still with her, a cold stone in her belly, but here, she had walls.

The sound of the key in the lock startled her. Marcus. Of course. He had his own key. He’d insisted on it months ago, "in case of emergencies." His presence immediately changed the quality of the air in the room. He filled the space, his sharp cologne overpowering the familiar, comforting scent of old paper and coffee. He stood by the door, watching her, his expression a careful mixture of patience and frustration. He had removed his suit jacket and slung it over his shoulder, a calculated gesture of casualness. He was here to manage the situation.

"El," he began, his voice soft, reasonable. "We need to talk about this. You can't just shut down like that." He walked further into the room, his polished leather shoes clicking on the floorboards, an alien sound in her quiet sanctuary. He stopped by her bookshelves, running a hand along the spines as if assessing their value. "I book a nice place, I try to do something special for you, and you have a total meltdown over a bit of glass. It was embarrassing. For both of us."

His words didn't feel like an opening for discussion; they felt like a prosecution. He was laying out the charges. She had failed to be the partner he required, the appreciative, untroubled accessory. She looked at him standing there, a slick, modern man silhouetted against her ancient histories, and the chasm between them yawned wider than ever. He wasn’t in her kingdom; he was an invader, trampling the borders she hadn't yet had the sense to define. He saw her silence as acquiescence and continued, stepping over to her desk, her sacred space. He picked up a printout of a map, the one showing the probable route of Offa’s Dyke.

"I just don't get why you let it get to you," he said, gesturing with the map, creasing the paper. "It's all in your head. Like all this stuff." He waved his hand dismissively over her notes, her carefully constructed timelines, the architecture of her novel. "You spend so much time in the past, cooped up in here with all these dusty old kings. Maybe that's the problem. You need to get out more. Get some perspective." He smiled, the brilliant, confident smile that always worked on his clients. "Tell you what. I'll book us a weekend away. Some fresh air. We could go hiking in the Peak District. Climb Mam Tor. The view from the top is incredible. It'll be good for you."

Mam Tor. The Shivering Mountain. A place famous for its height and its landslips, its inherent instability. He was offering to cure her fear of falling by taking her to a mountain that was literally falling apart. The absurdity of it, the profound, staggering, almost sublime ignorance of his suggestion, was the final, clarifying blow. He would never understand. He didn't want to. Her fear was not something to be shared and soothed; it was a character flaw to be corrected, an inefficiency in the system to be ironed out. He was not her ally. He was the force she needed to defend herself against. She felt the ground beneath her own feet solidify. The shaking stopped. The frantic bird in her chest grew calm.

"Marcus," she said. Her voice was quiet, but it cut through the air with the sharp, clean edge of a newly forged blade. He looked up, surprised by her tone. "I want you to put my map down. And then I want you to give me back your key." He stared at her, his smile faltering, a flicker of confusion in his eyes. He started to speak, to argue, to rationalize, but she held up a hand. "Please. I need you to go now." This was not a request. It was a decree. She was Offa, standing on the edge of her territory, drawing a line. It was not a great earthen dyke, not yet. It was just a sentence, spoken into the quiet of her own home. But it was a start. It was the first border of a kingdom she was finally beginning to claim.Marcus stared at her, the crumpled map of Mercia still in his hand. A slow, disbelieving smile spread across his face, the kind he used to disarm a difficult client. It was a reflex, an automatic deployment of charm in the face of an unexpected variable. He was a man who solved problems, and he was looking at her as if she were a particularly stubborn one that needed a new approach.
"Eleanor, let's not be dramatic," he said, his voice dropping into a soothing, patient cadence. "This isn't about the key. This is about lunch. You're upset, I get it. I was a bit sharp with you, and I'm sorry. But you can't throw away a three-year relationship because I wanted to sit on a terrace." He laid the blame for her reaction squarely on her own perceived over-sensitivity, neatly packaging her profound terror and his subsequent dismissal of it into a simple, manageable spat over a seating arrangement.

Eleanor didn't move. She didn't argue. She simply stood in the middle of her own living room, her hand outstretched, an island of quiet intransigence. The silence stretched, and in it, his smile began to fray at the edges. His confidence was a well-tailored suit, but it required a certain climate to hang correctly; her utter stillness, her refusal to engage in the argument he was trying to start, was creating a hostile weather system he couldn't navigate. He had expected tears, shouting, a dramatic but ultimately negotiable storm. He had not expected this calm, unyielding shoreline. This was a boundary, and he was on the wrong side of it.

"For Christ's sake, El," he finally snapped, the charm dissolving completely to reveal the hard impatience beneath. "Stop this. You're being childish." He tossed the map onto her desk, a gesture of contempt that scattered a small stack of index cards. They fluttered to the floor like dead leaves. Eleanor’s gaze didn’t flicker from his face. She watched him, a historian observing a predictable pattern of behaviour, a collapse of a minor dynasty. His anger was just the last, desperate flailing of a king whose authority had suddenly evaporated.

With a sigh of pure theatrical frustration, he dug into his pocket. The jangle of his other keys was a sharp, metallic sound in the quiet room. He unclipped her key from the ring. It was small and brass, worn at the edges from its time in his possession. For a moment, he held it in his palm, looking at it as if he still couldn't quite believe the demand was real. Then he strode forward and, instead of placing it gently in her waiting hand, he dropped it onto the small table by the door. It landed with a clatter that sounded as loud and final as a slammed gate. "Fine," he said, his voice tight with wounded pride. "If this is what you want. Wallow in here by yourself. But don't come calling me when you decide you need to rejoin the real world." He didn't look at her as he left, pulling the door shut behind him with a force that rattled the frame.

The click of the latch echoed in the sudden, absolute silence. Eleanor stood motionless for a long time, listening to the absence of his footsteps, his breathing, his presence. The air in the room seemed to expand, to thin out, returning to its natural state. Slowly, she lowered her hand. She walked to the door and picked up the key. It was still warm from his body. She curled her fingers around it, the serrated edge biting into her palm. She had done it. She had drawn the line. The immediate aftermath wasn't triumph or relief, but a deep, hollow trembling, the aftershock of a tectonic shift. She had sundered a continent. She was alone, in a way she hadn't been for three years.

Walking back to her desk, she knelt and began to gather the fallen index cards. Each one held a fact, a date, a quote. *Æthelbald, King of Mercia, killed by his own household guard, 757 AD.* *The Laws of Ine of Wessex, c. 694.* She stacked them neatly, restoring her own small, quiet order. Her gaze fell on her manuscript, the words on the screen suddenly looking foreign and distant. She had lost the thread. The world of Offa, which had been her refuge, now felt like just another place from which she was disconnected. The monster in her stomach hadn't vanished. In the echoing silence of the flat, it felt larger, its cold presence more acute. She had expelled the invader, but she was still trapped inside the fortress with a traitor. The bruised sky outside her window deepened, promising a rain that didn't come, and Eleanor felt a kinship with it, a sense of being suspended in a state of perpetual, unresolved threat. The work of building a dyke was lonely, and she was only just beginning to understand how much earth she would have to move.## Chapter 2

The silence, when it finally settled, was not a peaceful thing. It was a presence, a vast, hollow shape that occupied all the space Marcus had just vacated. For three years, her quiet had been punctuated by his noise: the aggressive thrum of his car arriving, the jangle of his keys, the confident cadence of his voice on the phone closing a deal. Even his silences had been loud, filled with the hum of his tablet or the rustle of the Financial Times. Now, the absence of those sounds created a vacuum, and Eleanor felt her own thoughts rushing in to fill it, chaotic and sharp. She stood holding the warm key for a full minute before walking to her desk and dropping it into an empty ceramic pot that had once held a succulent he’d killed through overwatering. A small, fitting graveyard for a dead thing.

Her body, which had been a rigid pillar of defiance, began to slump. The adrenaline drained away, leaving a residue of exhaustion and a deep, bone-aching sorrow. This was not the clean, triumphant severing of a bond she might have written for one of her characters. It was a messy, painful amputation, and she was acutely aware of the phantom limb. She moved through the flat on autopilot, a ghost in her own home, gathering the last vestiges of him. The electric toothbrush from the holder in the bathroom, its charging light a tiny, insistent green pulse of alien technology. A pair of running shoes by the door he’d worn twice. The half-empty bottle of ludicrously expensive single malt he kept on the kitchen counter. She didn’t throw them out. Instead, she methodically placed them all in one of the sturdy tote bags she used for library trips and put it by the door, a neat parcel of a life excised. It was a dispassionate, archival act. She was curating the end of an era.

With the physical evidence of him contained, she could no longer avoid the geography of her own fear. The flat was on the second floor. Not high. A perfectly reasonable height. She had lived here for five years, and the large, iron-framed window that overlooked the canal had always been her favourite feature. She loved to watch the narrowboats chug past, the swans glide with regal indifference, the water reflecting the moody Yorkshire sky. Now, as she approached it, she felt a familiar, sickening lurch. She kept her distance, standing several feet back, her eyes fixed on the opposite bank rather than the water directly below. The monster was awake. It whispered to her that the floorboards were not solid oak but a thin, treacherous membrane. It suggested the old glass in the window was brittle, that a sudden gust of wind could shatter it and pull her out into the nothing. She knew, with the rational part of her brain, that this was absurd. But the monster didn't speak the language of reason. It spoke the ancient, primal language of falling.

Retreating from the window, she wrapped her arms around herself. She couldn’t stay here, trapped between four walls with this new, potent strain of her own anxiety. Marcus’s parting shot echoed in her mind: *rejoin the real world*. The irony was that the real world, the solid, tangible world, was all she craved. The feel of pavement under her feet, the press of a crowd, the low-level hum of life happening at ground level. On impulse, she grabbed her coat and satchel, checked she had her own key, and left the flat. She didn't take the lift. She took the stairs, her hand trailing along the cool, painted brick of the wall, each step a deliberate, grounding act. Outside, the air was damp and heavy. The bruised-fruit sky had finally broken, and a fine, persistent drizzle was falling, slicking the cobblestones of the old mill yard. It felt like a blessing, a washing away.

She didn't have a destination. She just walked, heading away from the city centre, towards the sprawling, post-industrial landscape of Holbeck and Beeston. She walked past old pubs with faded signs, terraced houses with rain-streaked windows, and waste grounds where buddleia and rosebay willowherb grew in defiant clumps. This was not the Leeds of shiny shopping centres and rooftop bars. This was the city's underbelly, its gritty, unvarnished truth. The distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a train crossing a viaduct overhead—these sounds were a comfort. They were the sounds of things that were firmly attached to the earth. She found herself on a bridge crossing the canal, the same one she could see from her window. From this angle, only a few feet above the murky water, it held no terror. She leaned on the cold, wet iron of the railing, watching the rain dimple the surface. She had drawn her boundary, built the first stretch of her dyke. Now she stood outside its walls, surveying the territory she had just declared foreign. It was lonely out here. But for the first time since that day in Lincoln, she felt the frantic bird in her chest settle. The monster was not gone, but it had receded. Out here, in the sullen grey drizzle, with the solid iron of the bridge beneath her hands, she could breathe. The world, for a moment, stopped tilting.The rain began to fall harder, graduating from a fine mist to a steady, rhythmic drumming on the canal's surface and her coat. It was a clean sound, a sound without judgment. She turned from the railing and began to walk back, her path illuminated by the jaundiced glow of the streetlights that were just beginning to flicker on in the early twilight. She followed the towpath for a while, the dark water on one side, the high, blank brick wall of a former warehouse on the other. The path was uneven, slick with wet leaves, and she had to watch her step, a simple act of concentration that felt wonderfully anchoring. She was not thinking of falling from a great height; she was thinking of not slipping on a patch of mud. The scale of her world had shrunk to the next five feet in front of her, and within that small, manageable kingdom, she was competent.

When she finally reached her building, she felt a pang of apprehension at the thought of the vertical ascent, even one conducted within the groaning metal box of the lift. She chose the stairs again, her footsteps echoing in the cavernous stairwell. The door to her flat felt different now. With his key returned, it was no longer a permeable boundary, but a definitive seal. Inside, the bag of his belongings sat by the door like an unwelcome guest waiting to be shown out. The air was cool and still. She shrugged off her damp coat and went into the kitchen, her actions deliberate and slow. She filled the kettle, the rush of water a comforting roar. She selected a mug, one she had bought years ago from a pottery in Robin Hood’s Bay, its surface imperfect and pleasingly rustic. She made tea, strong and sweet, and wrapped her cold hands around the ceramic warmth.

She carried her mug to the desk, her command centre. The mess was exactly as she had left it, except for the scattered index cards and the creased map Marcus had handled so carelessly. She picked up the map, smoothing it out with the side of her hand. Offa’s Dyke. A dark, winding line drawn across the Welsh Marches. He’d called it 'dusty old stuff'. He saw it as a dead thing, a historical curiosity. But for her, it was alive. It was a scar on the land, proof that a man had once stood and said *enough*. He had marshalled thousands of men, moved millions of tons of earth, to give a physical form to an idea. The idea of *mine*. She sipped her tea, the heat spreading through her chest. Was it an act of power, or an act of fear? Perhaps there was no difference. Perhaps great power was simply the ability to build walls high enough to keep your fears at bay.

The monster in her gut was a fear of the void, of the great, empty nothingness that lurks beneath high places. But Marcus had shown her another kind of void: the emptiness between two people who are supposed to be connected. A void of empathy, of understanding. She had been free-falling in that space for months, maybe years, without even realising it. The terror she’d felt in the glass lift was only a symptom of a much deeper instability. The ground had been crumbling beneath her long before she’d climbed that cathedral tower in Lincoln. She had been building her life on his territory, a land where her own truths were dismissed as irrational moods and her deepest fears were an inconvenience. She looked from the map to her manuscript, the cursor blinking on the screen like a patient, waiting heartbeat. She had been trying to understand Offa’s kingdom, but she hadn’t even laid the foundations for her own.

Her gaze drifted, against her will, towards the window. The sky was now a deep, bruised purple, the colour of a fading storm. The lights of the city were smeared across the wet glass, a blurred constellation. She could feel the monster stir, the familiar cold whisper. *It’s a long way down.* But this time, another voice answered it, a quieter voice, her own. *It’s a long way back up, too.* She didn’t move from her chair. She didn’t force herself to the window to prove a point. She simply acknowledged the fear, and then, with a slow, deliberate movement, she turned back to her screen. She deleted the last sentence she had written, a piece of prose that had felt false even as she typed it that morning. Her fingers found the keyboard. She took a breath, and began to build. The first shovelful of earth. A single, true sentence.## Chapter 3

Eleanor woke to a world of grey. A soft, diffuse light filtered through the high windows of her flat, smoothing the sharp edges of the room into something softer and less defined. For a moment, suspended in the liminal space between sleep and waking, she felt a familiar pang of anxiety, a reflexive bracing for the presence of another person in her bed, for the imminent start of his noisy morning routine. But there was only silence. The profound, uninterrupted quiet of a home occupied by one. She lay still, listening. She could hear the gentle hum of the refrigerator, the distant rumble of a train, the faint, almost imperceptible sigh of the old building settling around her. It was the sound of her own life, unadulterated. The relief was so sharp and clean it felt like taking a breath after being held underwater.

She swung her legs out of bed and padded barefoot into the main room. The tote bag containing the last relics of Marcus sat by the door, a silent, reproachful lump. She ignored it. The monster in her gut was quiet this morning, a dormant beast. Emboldened, she walked towards the window, stopping a safe ten feet away. The canal below was a strip of placid steel under the overcast sky. A lone rower cut a neat, straight line through the water, his movements rhythmic and focused. She watched him until he disappeared under the bridge, a small, solitary figure master of his own tiny vessel. It felt like a good omen. She turned and went to her kitchen, her movements acquiring a new, unhurried grace. She didn’t have to work around anyone, or time her use of the coffee grinder to a pre-agreed schedule. The space was entirely hers. As the coffee brewed, filling the flat with its rich, dark scent, she felt a sense of ownership so deep it was almost physical, as if her very nerve endings were extending to the exposed brick walls and the high, timbered ceiling.

The first few days passed in a strange, concentrated blur. She didn't leave the flat. She sent Marcus a brief, polite text: *Your things are in a bag by the door. Let me know when you want to collect them. I’ll leave it outside.* His reply was instant, a single, clipped word: *Thursday.* With that final piece of logistical tidying done, she turned her full attention inward, to the only two places she could currently bear to exist: her flat, and the ninth-century kingdom of Mercia. She sat at her desk for hours, surrounded by her maps and timelines, the scent of her tea mingling with the dusty perfume of old books. The work was no longer just an escape; it was an act of reconstruction. She wrote about the marshlands, the forests, the complex network of rivers that formed Mercia’s fluid, ever-contested borders before the dyke. She wrote about the sheer, bloody-minded will required to impose a permanent line upon that shifting landscape.

She found herself lingering on the small details, the imagined lives of the men who did the digging. What did they fear more, the Welsh raiders from the other side or the Mercian overseer with his leather whip? Did they understand the grand political statement they were building, or was it just a ditch, a job, another day of back-breaking labour under a bruised and indifferent sky? She wrote with a ferocity she hadn't felt in years, the words pouring out of her not as a crafted narrative but as a raw, honest excavation of her own state of mind. Her fear was the wild, untamed land of Powys. Her flat was her precarious kingdom. And every sentence she put on the page was another spadeful of earth, another stone laid on the rampart. She was building her own dyke, not of mud and rock, but of language. It was a barrier not against the world, but against the void.

By Thursday morning, she had written twenty pages. The new chapter was raw and vital, alive in a way her previous, more cautious prose had not been. She had also drunk an entire box of tea and eaten nothing but toast and scrambled eggs. A fierce, almost manic energy had propelled her, but now, staring at the blinking cursor, she felt a sudden, hollow depletion. The silence of the flat, which had been a comfort, was beginning to feel like a confinement. She needed books she didn't own, primary sources she could only find in the university library. The thought of venturing out sent a tremor of the old anxiety through her, but it was weaker this time, muted by the stronger pull of her work. The historian in her was reasserting its dominance over the phobic.

Before she could lose her nerve, she showered, dressed in her most comfortable clothes—jeans, a soft wool jumper, her worn leather boots—and packed her satchel. As she was about to leave, she remembered the bag. She opened the door, placed the tote bag neatly outside, and closed the door again, the click of the lock a small, satisfying sound. On her way down the stairs, she passed a neighbour, a young musician who was always friendly. He smiled. "Morning, Eleanor." "Morning, Tom," she replied, and the simple, normal exchange felt like a miracle. The world was still out there, and it wasn't all judgment and impatient sighs. The walk to the university was a revelation. She kept her head up, taking in the details she usually missed when walking with Marcus, who was always in a hurry. The ornate ironwork on a Victorian warehouse, the surprising flash of a hidden public garden, the faces of strangers, each lost in their own unknowable story. It was all real, all solid, all gloriously, reassuringly at ground-level. The library was a haven, a great, silent church dedicated to knowledge. She breathed in the familiar scent of paper and binding glue and felt her shoulders relax. Here, in the quiet hum of whispered conversations and turning pages, she was not an embarrassment or a problem. She was a scholar, a writer. She was home.She navigated the labyrinth of shelves with the easy confidence of a native. The 942 section, British History, was as familiar to her as the layout of her own flat. She ran her fingers along the spines of the books, the names of the authors a litany of old friends and respected adversaries: Stenton, Kirby, Yorke. The physical weight of the volumes she pulled from the shelves was a comfort, a tangible counterpoint to the weightless, sick-making feeling of the abyss. These were objects dense with fact and theory, rooted in the verifiable soil of the past. She carried a heavy stack to a secluded carrel on the ground floor, a small, three-sided cubicle of dark wood that felt like its own defensible territory. Spreading her notebook and pens across the desk, she arranged the books around her and began her work.

The hours dissolved. She was lost in accounts of Mercian land charters and analyses of pollen samples taken from the dyke’s foundations. She found what she had been looking for in a slim, academic monograph on the Welsh perspective. The author quoted a line from a near-contemporary poem, a lament from a Welsh prince looking east across the new earthwork: "He has stolen the sun from my morning." The phrase struck her with the force of a physical blow. A boundary wasn't just a line of defence; it was an act of theft. It stole horizons. It blocked light. By building her wall against Marcus and his world, she had also cast a shadow over her own. She wrote the line down in her notebook, the simple act of transcribing it a recognition of a complex truth. Sovereignty was a lonely state, and the price of safety was a kind of self-imposed exile. The thought didn’t frighten her; it clarified things. It was a price she was, for now, willing to pay.

When she finally emerged from the library, blinking in the late afternoon light, the world seemed sharper, more vivid. The confidence she had found within the library’s walls came with her, a warm cloak against the damp air. The walk home was different from the morning's tentative exploration. She felt a part of the city's ceaseless flow, another anonymous figure moving with purpose along the pavement. She bought a loaf of fresh bread from a small bakery and a carton of milk from a corner shop, simple transactions that felt profoundly satisfying. She was provisioning her kingdom, sustaining herself. The thought made her smile. She was no longer just a terrified woman hiding in her flat; she was a monarch, however small her domain, attending to the business of the realm.

She took the stairs again, a habit that was already starting to feel natural. As she reached her floor, she saw that the tote bag was gone. The space by her door was empty, a clean, blank patch of landing. He had come and gone, a silent removal of his final traces. The finality of it washed over her, a wave of cold, clean water. There was a brief, sharp pang of something like grief, not for the man who had left, but for the woman she had been with him, the one who hadn't yet learned to be afraid of heights or men who didn't listen. But the feeling passed quickly, replaced by a quiet, steady sense of rightness. The lock on her door turned, the door swung open, and she stepped into a space that was, for the first time in three years, entirely and completely her own.

Inside, the silence felt different again. It was no longer a hollow absence or a temporary reprieve. It was a foundation. This was the ground floor of her new life, and she could build whatever she wanted upon it. She unpacked her new groceries, placing the bread on the counter and the milk in the fridge. She made another cup of tea and carried it not to her desk, but towards the large window overlooking the canal. She stopped, this time, only five or six feet away, closer than she had dared to stand all week. She didn't look down. She looked out, her eyes fixed on the sturdy, reassuring brick of the old warehouses on the opposite bank. She felt the familiar tremor start deep inside her, the monster stirring at this proximity to the edge. But her feet, shod in their comfortable, worn boots, felt planted on the solid oak floorboards. The dyke was holding. She took a sip of tea, her hand remarkably steady, and watched the grey Leeds sky bleed into the dark, unmoving water.That small act of defiance, of standing near the window and not shattering, felt more significant than any paragraph she had ever written. It was a private victory, unrecorded and unwitnessed, but it settled inside her like a foundation stone. She did not push her luck. She did not linger until the tremor returned in force. Instead, she took her still-warm mug and retreated to the solid, dependable heart of her kingdom: the worn oak of her desk. The research books she had brought back from the library were piled beside her, a bulwark of paper and ink. She sat, not to work, but simply to be in the place where she felt most herself, letting the quiet of the evening gather around her like a familiar shawl. The fortress was holding, and for the first time, it didn't feel entirely like a prison.

Later, she made dinner for one. The ritual was stripped of all its recent complexities; there was no negotiation over what to eat, no passive-aggressive dance around who cooked and who cleaned, no need to fill the silence with chatter. She chopped an onion, a carrot, and a stick of celery, the rhythmic thud of the knife on the wooden board a form of meditation. She sautéed them in olive oil, the simple, savoury smell filling the kitchen space. She added a tin of tomatoes and some herbs, making a plain, honest pasta sauce. It was food as sustenance, not as a statement or a performance. She ate at her small kitchen table, reading a book of poetry she hadn’t opened in years. The words were quiet, dense, and demanding of her full attention. They were the opposite of Marcus, the opposite of spreadsheets and profit margins, and she consumed them greedily, feeling a part of her mind, long dormant and neglected, stir back to life.

Sleep, when it came, was deep and profound, but the peace did not last. The monster, denied its power during her waking hours, staged a siege on her dreams. She was not in Lincoln Cathedral or the glass lift of the Trinity Centre, but standing atop Offa’s Dyke itself. It was impossibly high, a narrow spine of earth cleaving a world of swirling mist. On one side was Mercia, dark and forested; on the other, Wales, a land of jagged, unwelcoming mountains. The wind howled, trying to peel her from her perch. She looked down and saw that the dyke was not made of earth and stone, but of stacked books, their pages fluttering and tearing away in the gale. The ground beneath her was literally giving way, the foundations of her knowledge crumbling into the abyss. She woke with a gasp, her heart hammering against her ribs, the phantom sensation of falling leaving her slick with a cold, dream-sweat.

Shaken, she sat up in the darkness, pulling her knees to her chest. The silence of the flat, so comforting just hours before, now felt vast and empty. She was alone with the monster. The dyke she was building was a solitary project, and the dream had shown her its inherent vulnerability. A fortress with only one defender is a fragile thing. The thought led her, inevitably, to Sarah. Sarah Jenkins, a fellow post-grad from her York days, now a curator at the Leeds City Museum. They had once been inseparable, their friendship forged over late-night study sessions and a shared, cynical sense of humour. But the friendship had withered under the harsh, disapproving glare of Marcus, who had dismissed Sarah as "aimless" and "unfocused" simply because she valued her work-life balance over relentless ambition. Eleanor, in a thousand small ways she was now deeply ashamed of, had allowed the distance to grow. Picking up her phone from the bedside table, her thumb hovered over the screen. It felt like a momentous act, a plea for aid from across a border she herself had helped to create. With a sharp exhale, she typed a simple message: *Hi Sarah. It’s Eleanor. It’s been a ridiculously long time. I was wondering if you might be free for a coffee?*

She didn’t expect an immediate reply. It was late, and she imagined Sarah had a life, one that didn't involve being tethered to her phone. She put the device down and was about to get up to make tea when it buzzed on the nightstand. The screen lit up with Sarah’s name. *El! Blast from the past! Of course. I’d love to. I was just thinking about you the other day, wondering how you were. Is everything okay?* The simple, unhesitating warmth of the reply made Eleanor’s eyes sting. She had been so afraid of judgment, of being called to account for her long silence, but there was only kindness. *Everything’s… changing,* she typed back, the word feeling both honest and inadequate. *But I’m okay. I’ll tell you about it. How about the café at the Art Gallery? Friday?* She chose the venue with care. It was a grand, solid, Victorian building, rooted in the earth, its basement café a subterranean space of vaulted ceilings and cool stone. It was the safest place she could think of. The reply came back instantly. *Perfect. See you there. Can’t wait. xx.* Eleanor lay back against her pillows, the phone held to her chest. The monster was still there, but it no longer felt like it was the only thing in the room. A different kind of connection had been made, a bridge thrown across the chasm of her own making. For the first time in a very long time, she felt the possibility of an alliance.## Chapter 4

Friday arrived, and with it, a low-slung ceiling of cloud that seemed to absorb all sound, muffling the city in a blanket of quiet grey. Eleanor walked to the Art Gallery with a nervous, staccato rhythm, her boots clicking too quickly on the pavement. It had been more than a year since she had last seen Sarah properly, and their slow drift apart felt like a personal failing, a dereliction of a duty that mattered far more than any deadline. She was nervous that the easy intimacy they once shared would be gone, replaced by the stilted politeness of strangers who used to be friends. The Art Gallery and the attached Town Hall loomed ahead, a magnificent testament to Victorian ambition, all soaring spires and gothic grandeur. The building was a mountain of solid, carved stone, a thing so profoundly and immovably attached to the earth that looking at it eased a knot of tension in her shoulders. This was a place that understood gravity.

She pushed through the heavy wooden doors and made her way to the Tiled Hall Café. The transition was immediate and visceral. She left the grey, modern city behind and stepped into a dazzling cavern of nineteenth-century opulence. Every surface was covered in gleaming tiles of turquoise, jade green, and rich ochre. Marble pillars held up a vaulted ceiling painted with gold leaf, and the light from ornate chandeliers cast a warm, honeyed glow over everything. The air hummed with the gentle clatter of ceramic on saucer and the murmur of quiet conversation. It was the architectural antithesis of Angelica's: it was warm, not cool; ornate, not minimalist; grounded, not floating. It was a space designed to embrace, not to expose. Eleanor found a small table in a corner, sinking into a plush velvet chair with a sigh of relief. She felt safe here, enclosed in beauty, deep in the bedrock of the city.

A few minutes later, Sarah bustled in, her eyes scanning the room. She looked exactly the same, which Eleanor found absurdly comforting. Her dark, curly hair was piled haphazardly on top of her head, held in place by a pen. She wore a brightly coloured scarf over a crumpled linen dress, and a canvas tote bag overflowing with what looked like exhibition catalogues was slung over her shoulder. She spotted Eleanor and her face broke into a huge, unreserved smile that made her whole face crinkle. There was no hesitation, no awkwardness. She descended on the table, dropping her bag with a heavy thud and enveloping Eleanor in a hug that smelled of old paper, rain, and a faint, floral perfume. "El! Look at you! You look… well, you look like you need a massive slab of cake," she declared, pulling up a chair. "It is so, so good to see you." The warmth was so genuine, so uncomplicated, that Eleanor felt the tight knot of her anxiety begin to loosen.

They ordered tea and cake, and the initial conversation was a rapid, breathless catching up on the two years that had been stolen from them. Sarah talked about a frustratingly bureaucratic exhibition she was trying to mount on the industrial history of the River Aire, her words tumbling over each other in her excitement. Eleanor talked about her progress with the Offa book, carefully skirting around the edges of the emotional turmoil that now surrounded it. The conversation was a dance, both of them circling the one topic that sat between them: Marcus. Finally, as the waitress set down their plates—a decadent slice of chocolate Guinness cake for Sarah, a modest lemon drizzle for Eleanor—Sarah leaned forward, her expression softening. "He was never going to be here today, was he?" she asked gently. It wasn’t an accusation. It was a simple observation from someone who had always seen things clearly. Eleanor took a breath. "No," she said, her voice small. "He wasn’t. We broke up. On Tuesday."

Sarah’s reaction was not surprise, but a quiet, sad understanding. "Oh, El," she said, reaching across the table to briefly squeeze Eleanor’s hand. "I’m sorry it hurts. But I can't say I'm sorry it's over." She left it there, an invitation. She didn’t pry or demand details, but her dark, intelligent eyes were full of concern. The simple, unconditional support was what finally broke the dam. Eleanor found herself telling the whole story, the words spilling out in a rush, just as Sarah’s had. She started with the lunch at Angelica's, the glass lift, the windswept terrace. She tried to explain the visceral, bodily nature of the panic, the way the world had tilted, the way the air had felt thin and unbreathable. She was acutely conscious of how it must sound—a grown woman, a scholar of history, falling apart over a nice view.

"I know it's irrational," she kept saying, a phrase she’d borrowed from Marcus, a pre-emptive defence against the judgment she was braced for. "I know the glass is thick and it's perfectly safe, but my body doesn't believe it." She faltered, then decided to confess the whole, ugly truth of it. "It started a month ago, in Lincoln. I was climbing the cathedral tower, something I've done a dozen times, and I just… broke. I felt like something was trying to pull me out of a window. I had to be helped down. Marcus just said it was 'a bit of vertigo'. He was embarrassed by me on Tuesday, Sarah. He called me an embarrassment." The last word came out as a whisper, heavy with a shame so profound she couldn't meet her friend’s gaze. She stared at her untouched cake, expecting a platitude, a gentle suggestion to see a doctor, the same kind of well-meaning but useless advice she'd been giving herself.

Instead, there was only a short, thoughtful silence. When Eleanor finally risked a glance upwards, she saw no judgment in Sarah’s face. Only a deep, focused empathy. "That doesn't sound like 'a bit of vertigo'," Sarah said, her voice soft but firm. "That sounds utterly, bowel-twistingly terrifying. And for him to call you an embarrassment for being terrified… El, that’s not a partner. That's an audience member giving you a bad review." The accuracy of the metaphor, the immediate, unhesitating validation of her fear, was so startling that Eleanor felt a prickle of tears behind her eyes. He hadn’t been there with her; he had been watching her, and he hadn't liked the show. "I’d have been a mess too," Sarah continued, taking a large, unladylike bite of her cake. "I get wobbly on a stepladder. The idea of a glass box shooting up the side of a building? Nope. Not happening. You're a braver woman than I am for even getting in the lift."

The casual, self-deprecating admission was a gift. It didn't solve anything, but it reframed everything. Her fear wasn't a unique and shameful character flaw; it was a variation on a normal human theme. It was something that could be spoken about, even joked about, over tea and cake in a subterranean café. They talked for another hour. Eleanor found herself describing the monster, the dyke, the strange comfort of her second-floor kingdom. Sarah listened, nodding, asking questions that showed she was actually hearing the answers. She didn't offer a five-point plan for recovery. She didn't tell Eleanor to 'get a grip'. She simply sat with her in the fear, sharing its weight, making it feel less like a monstrous, private aberration and more like a difficult, painful, but ultimately navigable landscape. When they finally left, stepping back out into the cool grey afternoon, the hug Sarah gave her was fierce and long. "Don't be a stranger, Vance," she commanded. "I mean it. Call me. Even if you just want to sit in a basement and not talk."

Walking back towards Holbeck, Eleanor felt… lighter. The city didn't seem to press down on her. The sky, still the colour of old bruises, looked less like a threat and more like a familiar watercolour. As she crossed the bridge over the river, she glanced towards the city centre. The glass towers, home to Angelica's and Marcus's office, caught the weak light, gleaming dully. The sight still sent a faint tremor through her, a muscle memory of terror. But it was different now. The monster was still there, but she was no longer alone with it. She had an ally. She had opened a gate in her dyke, and the person she had let in had not invaded, but had brought supplies. The world was still full of unnerving heights and vertiginous drops, but for the first time in a long time, she felt like she might have something solid to hold onto.## Chapter 5

The feeling of lightness Eleanor carried back from the Tiled Hall Café was a strange and unfamiliar companion. It did not banish the gloom of the Leeds sky, but it seemed to exist alongside it, a pocket of warmth in the cool, damp air. Back in her flat, the silence that greeted her felt different yet again. It was no longer the stark, echoing quiet of a space recently emptied, nor the dense, concentrated quiet of a siege. It felt… potential. It was the quiet of a blank page, the quiet of a field lying fallow, waiting. She put the kettle on, the ritual now an automatic comfort, and went to her desk. The line she had copied down in the library lay open in her notebook: *He has stolen the sun from my morning.* Yesterday, it had felt like a lament for her own self-imposed isolation. Today, after seeing Sarah, it read differently. It was a statement of loss, yes, but it was also a statement of possession. You could only have your sun stolen if you believed the sun was yours to begin with. The Welsh prince hadn’t just lost a view; he had lost a part of his world. Eleanor picked up her pen. What happens, she wrote, the day after the sun is stolen? You don’t die. You learn to see in the shadows.

Her writing took on a new dimension. Before, she had been focused on the sheer, brutalist power of Offa’s Dyke, the definitive, violent act of drawing a line. Now, she began to think about its porosity. No wall is ever truly impenetrable. She delved into her research books, seeking out the whispers of what happened at the border. She found evidence of sanctioned crossing points, of market places where Welsh and Mercian traders met, their animosity suspended for the sake of commerce. She imagined spies slipping over in the dead of night, lovers arranging secret trysts in the shadow of the great earthwork, farmers on either side whose families had been sundered by the new geography, shouting news to each other across the divide. The dyke was not just an end; it was also a beginning. It created a new and complex human ecosystem along its entire length. The boundary was a place of tension, but also of exchange. Her own dyke, she realised, did not have to be a solid wall of brick and mortar. It could have gates. The coffee with Sarah had been a gate, deliberately opened.

The next morning, driven by this new perspective and a sudden craving for fresh air that wasn't just a frantic escape, she decided to walk to the market. Kirkgate Market was one of her favourite places in Leeds, a vast, chaotic, and gloriously ground-level cathedral of commerce. It was noisy and sprawling, a sensory overload of shouting greengrocers, the sharp tang of fish on ice, the earthy smell of potatoes, and the sweet, fatty aroma of sizzling bacon. It was the polar opposite of the sterile, high-altitude consumerism of the Trinity Centre. Here, everything was real and visceral. She bought cheese from a man who had been selling it on the same stall for forty years, his hands gnarled and knowing. She bought a punnet of late-season strawberries, their scent a ghost of summer. She felt anonymous and connected at the same time, just another person in the crowd, part of the city's vital, messy heartbeat. She was navigating a complex, crowded space with an ease she hadn’t felt in weeks, her focus on the tangible world around her, not the treacherous spaces in her own mind.

On her way home, laden with brown paper bags, she chose a slightly different route, one that took her over the railway lines via a high, arched footbridge. She reached the bottom of the steps and froze. The bridge was a lattice of black-painted iron, functional and unadorned. Through the gaps in the metal, she could see the tracks glinting far below, a complex web of steel disappearing into the distance. It wasn't six storeys high, not even close, but it was high enough. Her heart began its frantic, bird-beat rhythm. The monster, which had been sleeping soundly, woke with a snarl. It whispered that the iron was rusted, that the vibrations of a passing train would shake it apart. For a moment, she was rooted to the spot, her knuckles white where she gripped the handles of her shopping bags. Marcus’s voice echoed in her head, impatient and dismissive. *Honestly, El. It’s a bridge. Just walk across it.* But then, a second voice, Sarah’s, cut through the noise. *That sounds utterly, bowel-twistingly terrifying.* The difference was profound. One voice demanded she ignore her fear; the other gave her permission to feel it. She took a deep, shaky breath. She didn't have to cross it. There was no deadline, no reservation, no one waiting on the other side to be embarrassed by her. She looked up at the arch of the bridge, then turned and began to walk the long way round, a detour that would add ten minutes to her journey. It wasn't a defeat. It was a strategic retreat, a choice made from a place of self-preservation, not shame.

That evening, as she was unpacking her shopping, her phone buzzed with a text. It was Marcus. Her stomach clenched instinctively, a conditioned response. *Hi. Hope you're okay. Listen, I need to cancel the flights to Seville for October. The refund can only be processed back to the original card, which was mine. It’s about £300 for your half. Just transfer it to me when you can.* The message was pure Marcus: practical, efficient, with a veneer of politeness that barely concealed the transactional nature of the request. There was no malice in it, but there was also a complete absence of warmth. He was clearing a line item from his accounts. Three years, reduced to an electronic funds transfer. The brief, almost clinical interaction clarified something for her. The chasm between them wasn't just about a fear of heights; it was about two entirely different ways of seeing the world. He saw life as a series of problems to be solved and accounts to be balanced. She saw it as a story to be understood. There was no blame, she realised with a strange sense of calm. Just an insurmountable, fundamental incompatibility. She transferred the money immediately, typing *Seville flights* in the reference box. She did not add another word. As she hit send, she felt the final, slender thread connecting their two kingdoms snap. She was free. The thought was both exhilarating and, in its own way, just as terrifying as standing at the edge of a great height.Hitting 'send' on the banking app was a small, silent act, but it resonated through the quiet of her flat with the finality of a gavel’s strike. The transaction was complete. The last shared asset had been liquidated. For a moment, Eleanor felt a dizzying sense of lightness, a feeling of being untethered, like a balloon whose string had been cut. But the exhilaration quickly curdled. As the balloon rises, it becomes smaller and smaller, a lonely speck in a vast, empty sky. Her life with Marcus, for all its chafing constraints and quiet cruelties, had been a kind of anchor. It had given her days a shape, a narrative, however flawed. Now, that narrative was over. The future was no longer a path to be navigated, but a sheer, featureless cliff face. This was a new kind of vertigo, an existential drop that had nothing to do with gravity and everything to do with the terrifying, absolute freedom to choose what came next. The monster in her gut shifted its shape, its whispers no longer about falling from buildings but about drifting into nothingness.

She walked back to her desk, the bags of market produce sitting on her kitchen counter forgotten. She needed to feel the solid ground of her work beneath her feet. She looked at the maps of Mercia, the dense passages of text, the architecture of a world long dead but meticulously recorded. Offa had built a dyke to declare the limits of his power, to say *this far and no further*. He had secured his borders against his enemies. Eleanor had just finished expelling her own invader, but now she faced the harder task: governing the newly reclaimed territory alone. It was one thing to fight a war of independence; it was another entirely to build a nation in its aftermath. The sheer, daunting weight of her own autonomy settled upon her. Every decision, from what to eat for dinner to the entire direction of her life, was now hers and hers alone. The responsibility felt heavier than any fear of falling.

The days that followed fell into a new rhythm, one defined not by reaction and escape, but by quiet, deliberate construction. She established routines that were entirely her own. She woke with the light, made coffee, and sat at her desk for three hours every morning, regardless of whether the words came or not. The discipline itself was the point, a daily act of laying stones. She took a walk every afternoon, always choosing the low-level routes through the city’s network of canals and backstreets, her focus on the graffiti on the walls, the weeds in the pavement cracks, the solid, knowable details of the world at eye-level. She cooked simple, solitary meals, rediscovering the pleasure of eating what she wanted, when she wanted. She was slowly, methodically, building a life that fit her, a life that did not require her to be smaller, quieter, or less afraid than she was. It was a fragile construction, but it was hers.

One afternoon, a text from Sarah lit up her phone. *How goes the dyke-building? Need any more cake-based reinforcements? Also, a manuscript from the Thoresby Society just landed on my desk with a weirdly detailed account of a 17th-century ferryman at Crown Point. Thought of you.* The message was a small, bright window opening in her fortress wall. It was a reminder that her self-imposed boundary did not have to mean total isolation. She could have gates. She could control who she let in. The simple, nerdy offering of a historical tidbit was a sign that Sarah saw her and understood her, not as a problem to be fixed, but as a person with passions. *The dyke is holding,* Eleanor typed back, a smile touching her lips. *But I am dangerously low on cake. And I absolutely need to know about that ferryman.* They made a plan to meet the following week, and the knowledge of that future connection, another solid point on her calendar, made the present feel less precarious.

Her newfound peace was tested a few days later by the arrival of a formal, cream-coloured envelope. It was from the building's management company, informing residents that essential pointing and window frame restoration would be commencing on her side of the mill. Scaffolding would be erected the following Monday. Eleanor read the letter twice, her heart sinking. Scaffolding. A metal skeleton climbing the outside of her fortress. Men with tools and muddy boots would be just outside her window, on the other side of the glass that separated her from the drop. Her sanctuary was about to be breached. The monster stirred, whispering of structural instability, of faceless figures peering in, of the thinness of the barrier between her and the void. Her first instinct was to retreat, to draw the curtains and hide until it was over. But then she thought of the footbridge. She thought of her choice to walk the long way round. This was different. She couldn't walk around her own home. She had to hold her ground. She took a breath, folded the letter neatly, and placed it under a magnet on her fridge. It was a fact, not a threat. She would deal with it when it arrived.

That evening, propelled by a nervous energy she didn't know what to do with, she found herself standing by the window. The sky was clear for once, a rare, pale blue deepening to indigo at the edges. The lights were coming on across the city, turning the familiar landscape into a glittering tapestry. She held onto the cool metal of the window frame, her knuckles tight but not white. She could feel the faint tremor in her hands, the echo of her thudding heart. She thought of the scaffolding that would soon climb this wall, of the men who would work at this height without a second thought. She looked at the solid brick of the warehouse opposite, then at the dark, placid water of the canal. And then, without giving herself time to think, she tilted her head and looked straight down. The world swam for a sickening second. The two-storey drop felt like a canyon. The ground rushed up to meet her, a dizzying, terrifying pull. But it only lasted a moment. She forced herself to see what was actually there: a cobbled towpath, a patch of grass, the dark, unbroken surface of the water. It was just a view. She pulled her gaze back up, her breath catching in her throat, her body slick with a cold sweat. But as the frantic bird in her chest began to calm, a new feeling surfaced alongside the terror: a tiny, fierce, unfamiliar spark. It was the feeling of a battle fought and, in a small but crucial way, won. She had looked into the abyss, and the abyss had not swallowed her.She stepped back from the window, her legs trembling as if she had just run a marathon. The physical cost of that single moment of courage was immense; her muscles ached with phantom tension, and her head was light, the world still swimming slightly at the edges. She sank into the nearest armchair, her body slumping with a profound exhaustion that was entirely different from the wearying drain of anxiety. This was the fatigue of a soldier after a battle, not the enervation of a prisoner in a cell. The monster was not slain—she could still feel its cold presence, a sullen, resentful beast licking its wounds in a dark corner of her mind—but it had been faced. It had been defied. She had met its gaze and proven it was not all-powerful. The knowledge was a shield. As she sat there, watching the last of the colour drain from the sky, the thought of the scaffolding returned, but it had lost some of its menace. It was no longer an invading army poised to overrun her fortress, but simply a logistical challenge, an external event she would have to navigate. The men who would climb it were not agents of the void, but just men doing a job. She was still afraid, but the fear was no longer the only thing she could feel. Beneath it, fragile but persistent, was the memory of the ground, holding steady, far below.The following Monday morning, the invasion began not with a visual assault, but with a percussive one. Eleanor was at her desk, cradling a mug of coffee and trying to untangle a particularly dense passage about Mercian land-holding patterns, when the first clang echoed up from the mill yard. It was a sharp, discordant sound, metal striking metal, and it sliced through the quiet of her flat, making her flinch. It was followed by a man’s voice, shouting instructions that were muffled by the glass, and then another clang, closer this time. She closed her eyes, trying to block it out, trying to retreat into the ninth century, but the sounds were insistent, brutally present. This was the sound of a siege, the sound of an external will being imposed upon her sanctuary. The methodical, solitary work of building her own dyke felt suddenly futile against this loud, aggressive, physical construction.

She tried to work, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, but her focus was shattered. Every few minutes, another clang or a grinding scrape would pull her back to the present. Soon, the first pole appeared in her peripheral vision, a dark vertical line ascending past the edge of her window. It was quickly followed by another, and then a horizontal bar, locking them together. A grid was being built over her view, caging her in, section by section. The familiar panorama of the canal and the opposite bank was being dissected, framed in raw, galvanized steel. The structure grew with an unnerving speed, a metal vine climbing the brickwork. Eleanor abandoned any pretence of work, retreating from her desk to the sofa, as far from the window as she could get, pulling a blanket around her shoulders as if the air had grown suddenly cold. The monster was awake and agitated, feeding on the rhythmic, threatening sounds of the scaffolding’s assembly. It whispered that the structure was unstable, that it was putting a strain on the old brickwork, that the whole wall was about to peel away.

The climax arrived mid-afternoon. She heard a scraping sound, much closer than before, followed by the heavy thud of a wooden plank being dropped into place. There was a new presence on the other side of the glass. Holding her breath, she risked a glance. A man was standing on the newly laid platform, his back to her, his form silhouetted against the grey sky. He was younger than she’d expected, wearing a paint-splattered hoodie and dusty work trousers. He had headphones over a woolly hat, and he was moving with a fluid, unthinking confidence, his body entirely at ease three storeys above the ground. He turned to grab a tool from his belt, and for a heart-stopping second, his eyes swept over her window. He didn't see her. His gaze was vacant, directed inward at whatever music was blasting through his headphones. He was not a monster. He was not an invader. He was just a young man at work, lost in his own world, as indifferent to her and her terror as the swans on the canal.

The realisation was a strange, quiet anticlimax. Her panic had been a private storm he hadn't even registered. The abyss she felt yawning at her feet was, to him, just the space between his platform and the ground, a professional hazard he navigated daily with practiced ease. The profound disconnect between her internal state and his oblivious reality was jarring, but also, in a strange way, liberating. The threat felt less personal. It was not a malevolent force trying to pull her out; it was just a man, scaffolding, and the immutable fact of gravity. The fear did not vanish—her heart was still beating a little too fast—but its character changed. It lost its mythical, monstrous quality and became a manageable, if unpleasant, condition, like a chronic headache. She watched him for another minute as he methodically began to prep a window frame further down the wall. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, she stood up, walked back to her desk, and put her own headphones on. She filled her ears with the soaring, complex architecture of a Bach cello suite and, as the scaffolders continued their noisy work outside, she turned back to her own.

The meeting with Sarah was a welcome escape into the warm, scented air of a different café, this one a tiny, independent place tucked down a side street, full of mismatched furniture and the smell of roasting coffee. The scaffolding, now a completed metal web over her window, had made her flat feel like a cage, and sitting here, in a space that was busy and anonymous, felt like a parole hearing.
"A ferryman at Crown Point, you say?" Eleanor prompted, after they’d ordered.
"Yes! An absolute gem," Sarah said, her eyes alight with the pleasure of a shared discovery. "This chap in 1680, apparently, got into a massive feud with a miller on the opposite bank of the Aire. The miller built a footbridge to try and put him out of business, so the ferryman started offering free beer to all his passengers. Turned his ferry into a floating pub, basically. It’s all in this fantastically passive-aggressive diary."
Eleanor laughed, a genuine, unforced sound. She could picture it perfectly, the petty, stubborn, intensely human drama playing out on the water’s edge. "That’s brilliant. A boundary dispute resolved with alcohol."
"Exactly! See? Not all borders lead to war. Some lead to happy hour," Sarah grinned. The story, so specific and absurd, lodged in Eleanor's mind. It was a perfect illustration of what she had been trying to grasp in her writing. The dyke was the official, state-sanctioned boundary, but all along it, for centuries, ordinary people like the ferryman and the miller had been negotiating their own, smaller, more personal borders with ingenuity and spite and beer.

They talked for over an hour, the conversation weaving easily from seventeenth-century Leeds to Sarah’s disastrous recent date with a man who thought archaeology was "mostly just gardening." At one point, Sarah paused, stirring her latte thoughtfully. "You know, all this talk of being trapped in your flat," she said, her tone gentle. "Have you thought about getting out completely? Not for good, just for a day. We could drive out to the coast. Flamborough Head. It’s all chalk cliffs and sea birds. It’s high up, mind, but it’s… different. It’s big sky, not a big drop. Maybe a different kind of height would feel different?" The suggestion was tentative, an offer, not a prescription. Unlike Marcus’s bullish insistence on climbing a mountain to "cure" her, Sarah was proposing a joint expedition, a change of scenery. Flamborough Head. The name conjured images of wind and salt and a vast, horizontal expanse of water meeting the sky. It was terrifying, and for that very reason, a tiny part of Eleanor was intrigued. "Maybe," she said, the word a small, cautious opening of a gate. "Let me think about it."

When Eleanor got home, the flat was quiet. The workmen were gone for the day. The scaffolding stood in silent, skeletal watch outside her window. She approached it cautiously, as one might approach a large, unpredictable animal that was temporarily asleep. The setting sun was catching the metal bars, turning the cold steel to a temporary, burnished gold. It looked almost beautiful. She remembered the young man with his headphones, entirely absorbed in his own world. She remembered Sarah’s offer of a different kind of height, a different perspective. Her kingdom still felt precarious, besieged by her own internal monster and this external metal cage, but her borders were no longer sealed. She had an ally. She had new stories to think about. And she had a choice, not just to retreat, but to venture out. She looked at the golden grid against the deepening blue of the sky, and for the first time, it didn't look like a cage. It looked like a ladder.## Chapter 6

The scaffolding became the new rhythm of her days. Its sounds were her alarm clock: the first metallic clangs from the yard below, the rumble of boots on the wooden planks, the low murmur of voices that drifted through the glass. At first, she had tried to block it out, retreating into the sonic fortress of her headphones. But after a few days, a historian’s curiosity, or perhaps a writer’s need to observe, began to override her fear. She found herself watching the men from the relative safety of her sofa, turning them from anonymous threats into characters in a silent play. There was the younger one, the one she’d seen first, whom she mentally dubbed 'The Singer' because his head was always bobbing to a beat only he could hear. There was his older partner, a stout, methodical man with a grey beard who seemed to be in charge, 'The Foreman'. They moved around the metal grid with a startling, balletic grace, their bodies so accustomed to the height that it had become their natural element. They were not wrestling with the void; they were simply at the office.

This detached observation was a manageable form of exposure, but it was shattered one lunchtime. She watched, her tea mug halfway to her lips, as The Foreman sat on the edge of a platform directly outside her window to eat his lunch. He unwrapped a sandwich from a piece of foil, his legs dangling casually over the three-storey drop. He leaned back against a vertical pole, chewing contentedly as he looked out over the city. Eleanor’s own stomach twisted into a cold, hard knot. Her palms grew damp. She could feel the phantom pull of gravity on his behalf, the sheer, terrifying emptiness beneath the soles of his work boots. The sight was so profoundly alien to her own bodily experience that it made her feel dizzy. But mingled with the bile of her fear was a sliver of something else, a feeling so strange and new she couldn't immediately name it. It was a kind of longing, not for his lack of fear, but for his freedom. He possessed a physical liberty in the world that she had lost, the simple, unthinking right to occupy any space without it turning into a battleground.

Sarah’s text message about Flamborough Head became a focal point for this new, unsettling awareness. Eleanor read it over and over again, dissecting its gentle phrasing. *It’s big sky, not a big drop.* The idea was seductive. Could a height feel different depending on its context? Was it the verticality of the city, the man-made plunge between buildings, that was her particular poison? Or was all height her enemy now? The thought of standing on a cliff edge, with nothing but wind between her and the churning North Sea, sent a wave of nausea through her. It seemed like a terrible, reckless idea. And yet. The alternative was to stay here, in her carefully curated kingdom, a sovereign ruler of a shrinking territory, watching men dangle their legs over the abyss she could not even approach. The bruised-fruit sky over Leeds, once a comfort, was beginning to feel like the low ceiling of a prison.

The dilemma bled into her work. She was trying to write about the market towns that had sprung up in the shadow of the dyke, places of fraught but necessary exchange. She imagined a Welsh farmer’s wife, her whole life spent in the shelter of the mountains, deciding to walk the miles to the border to trade wool for salt. What did she feel as she approached that vast, intimidating earthwork, the symbol of the power that had subjugated her people? Was she terrified? Was she defiant? Did the practical need for salt, the desire for a better life for her family, outweigh the fear of the unknown territory beyond the wall? Eleanor realised, with a jolt of intellectual shame, that she was trying to imagine this woman’s courage from a position of profound cowardice. She was writing about crossing borders while refusing to even cross a footbridge. The hypocrisy was galling. The work felt thin, academic, lacking the very human truth she was striving for, because she was unwilling to experience any emotional risk herself.

The decision came on a Friday afternoon. The workmen were packing up for the weekend, their movements looser, their voices louder with the anticipation of release. The Singer, his headphones finally off, was whistling a tuneless, cheerful melody as he gathered stray tools. As he reached for a roll of electrical tape, his glove caught on it and knocked it from the platform. Eleanor watched it fall. It didn't plummet with a terrifying scream; it simply tumbled, end over end, a small, dark object growing smaller, until it landed on a patch of grass by the towpath with a faint, almost inaudible thud. There was no drama. The Singer glanced down, saw where it had landed, and shrugged. "Ah, bugger," he said, his voice clear through the glass. The Foreman laughed. "Leave it. Pick it up Monday." And that was it. They went back to their work. The fall was a minor inconvenience, an errand for another day. It was not a judgment from the abyss. It was just a dropped roll of tape.

That small, mundane moment broke something in Eleanor. The casual, unbothered reaction of the two men robbed her fear of its grand, metaphysical power. It reduced the terrifying drop to a simple matter of distance and gravity, an everyday problem that could be solved by walking down the stairs. The abyss wasn't a predator that had tasted her; it was just empty space, and it was only as powerful as she allowed it to be. She looked away from the window, her heart beating a steady, resolute rhythm, and picked up her phone. Her thumb found her conversation with Sarah. The fear was still there, a cold, familiar hum beneath the surface of her thoughts, but for the first time, the desire to break free from its tyranny was stronger. She typed the word: *Yes.* Her thumb hovered over the send button for a single, heart-stopping second. Then, taking a breath as if she were about to step off a ledge, she pressed it. The message vanished from her screen. A moment later, she typed another. *When are we going?*Sarah’s reply came back less than a minute later, a rapid-fire burst of enthusiasm that felt like a warm hand grabbing hers. *YES! Amazing! How about Sunday? I'm free all day. I'll drive. Pick you up at 9? We'll need sturdy boots and I'll bring a flask of offensively strong tea and my world-famous (in my own kitchen) lemon drizzle cake. Non-negotiable.* The sheer, uncomplicated delight of the message, its immediate transformation of a terrifying prospect into a concrete plan involving cake, was the most reassuring thing Eleanor could have imagined. It stripped the journey of its epic, psychodramatic weight and repackaged it as a simple day out between friends. A knot of tension she hadn't even realised she was holding in her jaw released. She typed back: *Sunday is perfect. I’ll be ready.*

The intervening Saturday was a strange limbo. Eleanor woke with a low thrum of anxiety, a baseline hum of dread for the day to come. The scaffolding outside her window, which she had viewed with a kind of academic detachment the day before, now seemed to mock her, its high, empty platforms a preview of the cliffs. The monster, which had been momentarily silenced by her decisive action, was stirring again, whispering persuasive arguments for retreat. It reminded her of the sickening lurch in the Lincoln tower, the breathless panic in the glass lift. It painted vivid pictures of her, frozen with terror on a cliff edge, becoming the public embarrassment Marcus had always feared she was. The urge to text Sarah with a fabricated excuse—a sudden cold, a looming deadline—was immense, a physical pull towards the safety of her flat.

To fight it, she threw herself into motion. She cleaned her flat with a ferocious, meticulous energy, scrubbing floors and polishing surfaces as if she could scour the fear from her own mind. She organised a section of her bookshelf that had long been in disarray, the simple act of putting her intellectual world into order a balm to her chaotic emotional state. She did not allow herself to sit and think. In the afternoon, she walked to the library, returning her books and taking out new ones, focusing on the weight of the volumes in her bag, the solid feel of the pavement beneath her boots. It was a day spent shoring up her defences, not against the world, but against the saboteur within. She was behaving like the person she wanted to be, a person who kept promises and faced challenges, in the hope that the behaviour would eventually solidify into belief.

Sunday morning dawned grey and still. Eleanor woke before her alarm, the knot of dread in her stomach having tightened overnight into a cold, hard stone. The monster was no longer whispering; it was shouting. She felt a tremor in her hands as she made coffee and forced herself to eat a piece of toast that tasted like cardboard. She dressed as if for battle, in her thickest wool jumper, comfortable jeans, and the worn leather boots that had carried her across so many solid, dependable miles of city pavement. They felt like a connection to the person she used to be, the one who walked without fear. She packed a small rucksack with a bottle of water, a notebook and pen—her ultimate security blanket—and an apple. As she waited, she paced the length of her living room, a caged animal, deliberately keeping her back to the window. Every car that passed in the street below sent a jolt of panic through her, a mix of terror that Sarah was arriving and a deeper terror that she wouldn’t.

At precisely nine o'clock, a cheerful double-beep from the street broke the silence. Eleanor took a deep breath, walked to the window, and looked down. Sarah’s car, a slightly battered but friendly-looking dark blue hatchback, was parked by the entrance. It was a car that looked like it was used for hauling plants from the garden centre and taking muddy dogs for a walk, the polar opposite of Marcus’s sterile, aggressively pristine machine. Sarah got out, looked up, and gave a huge, reassuring wave. Eleanor grabbed her bag, locked her door with a decisive click, and took the stairs two at a time, a forward momentum she could not afford to lose. The short walk from the mill’s entrance to the car felt like crossing a vast, exposed plain, but Sarah’s smile was a beacon. "Morning!" she said, as Eleanor slid into the passenger seat. "Ready for an adventure? I’ve got the cake secured in the back. Top priority." Her normality was a lifeline.

The journey out of Leeds was a gradual unfurling. They navigated the familiar arteries of the city, the dense red-brick terraces and converted mills of Holbeck giving way to the sprawling suburbs, and finally to the wide, open artery of the A64. The city, with its vertical threats and claustrophobic canyons, fell away behind them. Eleanor watched the landscape flatten and widen, the sky growing larger and more dominant as they sped east. The low-slung grey clouds seemed to stretch to an infinite horizon. The conversation was light, a deliberate construction of normalcy. They talked about a new historical novel Sarah had read, the ridiculous internal politics of the museum board, a shared, comical memory from their university days. Eleanor found herself laughing, the sound surprising her. The knot in her stomach remained, but it was no longer the only thing she could feel. She was doing it. She was in a car, willingly travelling towards a great height, a passenger on an expedition she had chosen, moving steadily and irrevocably towards the sea.## Chapter 7

As they left the A-road behind, the character of the world changed. The landscape unfurled, shedding the last remnants of the urban and suburban, and spreading out into the vast, flat expanse of Holderness. The sky, which in Leeds always felt like a lid, here felt like the whole world. It was an immense, overwhelming canvas of shifting greys, under which they were a tiny, speeding speck of dark blue. Eleanor watched the fields of winter wheat ripple in the wind, the sight so hypnotically horizontal it felt like a balm. The vertical world of towers and scaffolding and sheer drops felt a million miles away. Then she saw the first gull, a slash of brilliant white against the grey, hanging impossibly still on the wind. The air in the car, pulled in through the vents, seemed to thin and sharpen, carrying a new, briny tang. The sea was close.

"Do you know what started it?" Sarah asked, her eyes on the road, her tone casual but her question precise. "I mean, was there a moment? Or did it just creep up on you?"
The question was so different from Marcus's dismissive diagnoses. It presumed a history, a cause, a narrative. Eleanor found herself able to answer without the familiar preface of shame. "Lincoln," she said, watching a line of wind-bent trees flash past. "I was in the cathedral, up the tower. I’ve been up it dozens of times. But I looked down through one of the arrow-slits, and the world just… broke. It felt like the gravity had reversed, like the ground wanted me specifically. It felt malicious." She risked a glance at Sarah, expecting a flicker of disbelief, but her friend just nodded slowly.
"Old places have a weight to them," Sarah said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. "All that stone, all that time, all those hopes and fears soaked into the walls. Sometimes I think they can get a bit… loud. Maybe the cathedral just decided to shout at you that day." The idea was absurd, unscientific, and more comforting than any rational explanation she had ever been offered. It gave her fear a context outside of her own flawed mind. It made it part of a larger story, a story of old stones and the echoes they carry.

They pulled into a gravel car park near the Flamborough Head lighthouse. The moment Sarah cut the engine, the silence was replaced by a new set of sounds: the relentless, sculptural force of the wind, the distant, mournful cry of gulls, and underneath it all, a deep, resonant roar that vibrated through the frame of the car. The sea. It wasn't the gentle lapping of a canal; it was a vast, powerful engine. For a moment, Eleanor just sat there, gripping the door handle, the safe metal box of the car suddenly feeling like the only sane place to be. Sarah, oblivious or pretending to be, hummed to herself as she rummaged in the back, emerging with a tartan flask and a Tupperware box. "Right," she announced cheerfully. "Provisions acquired. Shall we?" Her complete lack of ceremony was an invitation Eleanor couldn't refuse. She opened the door and stepped out, and the wind hit her like a physical blow, whipping her hair across her face and stealing the air from her lungs. The smell was sharp, clean, and overwhelmingly real: a mix of salt, wet chalk, and bird-lime.

The path to the cliff edge was a well-trodden track through rough, windswept grass. Every step felt momentous. The roar of the sea grew louder, the cries of the gulls sharper. Eleanor kept her eyes fixed on Sarah’s back, a splash of bright red waterproof jacket ahead of her, using her as a shield against the sheer scale of the landscape. The monster was screaming now, a litany of terrors. *The cliff edge is unstable. A gust of wind will take you. You’re too close. Turn back now.* Her legs felt stiff and clumsy, her boots suddenly inadequate for this wild, untamed terrain. She focused on the simple mechanics of walking, planting one foot and then the other, her entire being concentrated on this single, forward motion. She could feel the open space to her right, a vast emptiness that tugged at her senses, but she refused to look.

Then Sarah stopped. They were there. Eleanor risked lifting her head, her heart hammering a frantic, panicked rhythm against her ribs. The sight that met her was so immense, so brutally beautiful, it defied all her expectations of terror. A sheer, white cliff of chalk dropped away into a tumultuous sea of churning grey-green, capped with white foam. The scale was inhuman. Gulls and gannets wheeled and soared in their thousands, their cries weaving into the sound of the wind and waves to create a wild, unholy symphony. It was a place of raw, elemental power. The drop was immense, far greater than any she had faced before, a dizzying, absolute fall to the jagged rocks below. She felt the familiar, sickening lurch, the instinctive recoil. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides.

But then, as she stood there, frozen, her mind caught up with what her eyes were seeing. Sarah had been right. It was different. The overwhelming impression was not of the drop, but of the horizon. The vast, unbroken line where the grey sea met the grey sky stretched out forever. It was a landscape of radical horizontality. The terror of the city was the terror of the vertical, of being trapped between tall, man-made things that threatened to let you fall. This was the terror of nature, but it was also its sublime beauty. The drop was just one element in a composition so enormous that it humbled her fear into a different perspective. It wasn't about her. The cliff wasn't trying to pull her down. The wind wasn't trying to steal her. They simply *were*. They had been here for millennia before her and would be here for millennia after. Her fear, her very existence, was a tiny, insignificant thing in the face of this geological time, this elemental power.

"Blimey," Sarah said softly, standing a few feet away. "Puts a bad day at the museum in perspective, doesn't it?" She unscrewed the top of the flask, pouring steaming tea into two plastic cups. She held one out to Eleanor. Her hand was shaking as she took it, but she didn’t retreat from the edge. She stood her ground, the raw wind tearing at her, and looked out at the endless, restless sea. She took a sip of the hot, sweet tea, the warmth a small, human anchor in the face of the sublime. The monster was still there, a cold knot of terror deep inside her, but it was quiet, silenced by awe. She had looked over the edge of the world, and she was still standing. The wind whipped tears from her eyes, but for the first time in a very long time, they weren't tears of fear.They stood in a companionable silence for a long time, letting the wind tug at their coats and the scalding tea warm their insides. The world was reduced to the roar of the sea and the cry of the gulls. To stop her mind from spiralling into the abyss, Eleanor began to do what she did as a historian: she observed and catalogued the details. She noted the different species of seabird, distinguishing the sharp, black-tipped wings of the kittiwakes from the powerful, arrow-like dive of the gannets. She studied the stratification of the chalk, the dark lines of flint embedded within the white, a record of ancient pressures and unimaginable spans of time. She was trying to master the landscape by learning its language, just as she mastered a historical period by learning its charters and laws. It was a form of intellectual control, a way of building a small, knowable framework around an overwhelming experience. She was, she realised, researching the geography of her own fear, and finding it was a far more complex and ancient terrain than she had imagined.

"Cake o'clock," Sarah announced, her voice raised against the wind. She led the way to a slightly more sheltered hollow in the grass, a few feet further back from the precipice, and sat down, cross-legged. With a flourish, she opened the Tupperware box. The lemon drizzle cake, pale yellow and glistening with its sugary crust, looked gloriously, comically out of place in this wild setting. It was a profound statement of normality, a small, sweet, man-made thing in a landscape of sublime, inhuman forces. Sarah carved two generous slices with a plastic knife and passed one to Eleanor on a napkin. Eating cake with a flimsy fork, bracing against a gale on the edge of a cliff, felt like the sanest, most human thing Eleanor had done in months. Between bites, she found herself telling Sarah about the dream, the dyke made of crumbling books, the terror of her own knowledge failing her. Sarah listened, her expression serious, licking sugar from her fingers. "Well, of course it was crumbling," she said, when Eleanor had finished. "You were trying to build it all by yourself. Even Offa needed thousands of men to move all that dirt. No one builds a dyke alone, El."

Bolstered by sugar and tea and friendship, they decided to walk. The path snaked along the cliff top, a narrow ribbon of trodden earth between the rough grass and the vertiginous drop. Every step was a fresh negotiation. Eleanor’s body wanted to veer inland, to hug the safety of the fields, but she forced herself to follow Sarah’s steady, rhythmic pace. She didn’t look down. She looked ahead, at the red of Sarah’s coat, a fixed point in the shifting, elemental world. Or she looked out, at the endless grey meeting of sea and sky, a horizon so vast it seemed to pull her forward rather than down. With every step, she thought of the characters she was trying to write—the people who had lived and died in the shadow of a different, man-made boundary. She thought of the courage it took not to charge an enemy, but simply to walk to a new market, to cross a line, to keep going when every instinct screamed for retreat. This, she realised, was the truth she had been missing. Courage was not a heroic, abstract quality. It was a muscular act, a choice renewed with every single footstep.

The journey home was quiet, bathed in the soft, fading light of the late afternoon. The adrenaline had long since evaporated, leaving Eleanor with a clean, profound exhaustion, the satisfying ache of muscles used and a mind stretched to its limit. The landscape inside the car felt muted and safe, the roar of the wind replaced by the gentle hum of the engine and the soft rock station Sarah had tuned to. Eleanor watched the flat fields of Holderness slide by, the world outside the windows seeming smaller now, less threatening. She felt as though the wind at Flamborough had scoured her clean, blasting away months of accumulated, circular anxieties and leaving behind a kind of calm emptiness. Sarah drove with an easy competence, glancing over at Eleanor occasionally with a small, knowing smile. There was no need for a triumphant debrief or a detailed analysis of the day. The experience existed between them, a shared and solid thing, understood without words. They had gone to the edge of the world together and come back.

When Sarah pulled up outside the mill, the building looked different in the deepening twilight. It seemed smaller, less imposing. The scaffolding, a black lattice against the sodium orange of the streetlights, was just a metal grid, an inanimate and temporary structure. It had lost its power to menace. "Thank you," Eleanor said, and the words felt ridiculously inadequate. She turned to Sarah, and the gratitude she felt was so fierce it was almost painful. She hugged her friend across the gearstick, a clumsy, heartfelt embrace that conveyed everything she couldn't say. "Anytime," Sarah said softly. "The ferryman's floating pub awaits its historian." Alone, Eleanor climbed the stairs, feeling the satisfying protest of her tired leg muscles. She let herself into the silent flat, dropped her rucksack by the door, and, without pausing to think, walked straight to the great window. She looked down. The cobbled towpath, the dark gleam of the canal, the two-storey drop. The familiar, sickening lurch was there, a ghost in her nervous system, but it was faint, a distant echo of its former power. It was overwhelmed by a newer, stronger memory: the roar of the sea, the endless grey horizon, and the feeling of the solid ground beneath her feet, holding her, right at the very edge. Her kingdom hadn't been breached. It had just expanded to encompass a much, much bigger sky.Eleanor woke on Monday morning to the unfamiliar sensation of a body well-used. Her calf muscles ached from the long walk along the cliffs, a dull, satisfying protest that grounded her in her own physicality. The sleep had been deep and dreamless, a true oblivion rather than a tense ceasefire with her subconscious. For the first time in weeks, the initial moment of consciousness was not accompanied by a jolt of anxiety or a sense of dread. The monster was quiet. She knew it wasn’t gone, but it felt as if it had retreated to a distant corner of her kingdom, a grumbling but currently powerless exile. The light filtering through the metal grid of the scaffolding seemed less like the bars of a cage and more like a complex, abstract pattern, a problem of geometry rather than a threat of confinement.

She felt a potent, unfamiliar pull towards her desk. The creative well, which had felt so dry and brackish, now seemed to be refilling. She sat down, the worn wood of the chair a familiar comfort, and looked at the last sentence she had written before the weekend, a sentence about the Welsh farmer’s wife that had felt flimsy and speculative. She deleted it. Then, drawing on the raw, sensory memory of the wind at Flamborough, the solid ground beneath her feet, and the vast, humbling scale of the cliffs, she began to write again. The words came not from a place of academic imagination, but from a place of bodily knowledge. She wrote of the woman’s boots on the muddy track, the cold wind whipping at her shawl, the way her gaze kept snagging on the intimidating line of the dyke on the horizon. She wrote of the small, deliberate acts of courage: the choice to keep walking when her legs ached, the conscious effort to breathe when fear constricted her chest, the focus on the sack of wool on her back and the salt she would bring home. The prose was sinewy and strong, rooted in the visceral reality of a body moving through a difficult landscape. She wasn't just describing a character; she felt like she was transcribing a memory.

The familiar clangs and scrapes from the scaffolding began around eight, but they no longer felt like an assault. They were just part of the city’s morning chorus, like the distant traffic and the rumble of the trains. Emboldened, Eleanor did something she hadn't done since the structure was completed: she opened her curtains wide. The full, intricate web of steel was revealed, framing her view in a series of rectangles and squares. A few moments later, The Singer appeared on the platform outside, moving with his usual easy grace. He was drinking from a steaming mug, and as he turned, his eyes met Eleanor's through the glass. There was a flicker of surprise on his face, quickly replaced by a simple, human acknowledgement. He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. On impulse, Eleanor nodded back. And that was it. The exchange lasted no more than two seconds, but it was a profound shift. The anonymous, threatening figure had become a neighbour, a man having his morning tea. The glass between them was not the only thing separating them from the abyss; it was a window between two separate, functioning worlds that had just, for a moment, recognized each other.

Later that morning, she needed a book from the Brotherton Library, a specific volume on Mercian coinage. The walk there would take her past the iron footbridge. In the past, she would have automatically plotted her route to avoid it, adding the extra ten minutes without a second thought. Today, she didn't. The thought of the bridge rose in her mind not as an obstacle, but as a question. An invitation. She found herself walking towards it with a deliberate, steady pace, her satchel containing her notebook and wallet feeling like both an anchor and a pack of supplies for an expedition. When she reached the bottom of the steps, she paused. The black iron latticework rose before her, stark against the grey sky. The old script of fear began to play in her mind—the vibrations, the height, the gaps in the metal showing the glinting tracks below. She felt the familiar tremor start in her hands. But then, she overlaid it with a new memory: the immense, horizontal line of the sea at Flamborough. She thought of Sarah’s voice, calm and steady beside her. She thought of the cake, a ridiculous, joyful anchor in the teeth of the gale.

She placed her hand on the cold, painted iron of the handrail and began to climb. Each step was a conscious decision, a small victory. The metal rang with the tread of her boots. The higher she got, the more the city opened up around her, a panorama of red brick and slate roofs. She did not allow her gaze to drop to the tracks directly below. Instead, she looked ahead, towards the solid, reassuring clock tower of the university in the distance. She reached the apex of the bridge just as a train thundered underneath. The entire structure vibrated, a deep, resonant hum that travelled up through the soles of her feet and into her bones. The fear lanced through her, sharp and hot, a jolt of pure, primal terror. Her knuckles whitened on the rail. But she didn't close her eyes. She held her ground, breathing through the panic, feeling the vibration as a physical phenomenon, not a prelude to collapse. It was just energy, just a train passing. It lasted five seconds, and then it was gone, its roar fading into the distance. She was still standing. The bridge was still standing. She took a breath, then another, and then she walked down the other side, her steps measured and sure, until her boots met the solid, glorious, unmoving pavement.## Chapter 8

The rest of the walk to the library passed in a state of quiet wonder. Eleanor felt as though a subtle filter had been removed from her perception of the world. The colour of a peeling blue door, the intricate pattern of moss on a stone wall, the fleeting expression on a stranger’s face—everything seemed sharper, more vivid, more real. The city had not changed, but her place within it had been profoundly altered. She was no longer a ghost haunting its edges, but a citizen walking its solid ground. The triumph of the bridge crossing did not announce itself with a surge of elation, but with a deep, calm certainty, a feeling like a key turning smoothly in a well-oiled lock. The world, which had been tilted and treacherous, had finally clicked back into its proper alignment. Inside the library, surrounded by the hushed reverence and the comforting scent of old paper, she felt a focus so pure and untroubled it was like drinking cool water after days of thirst. The book on Mercian coinage yielded a fascinating detail about Offa striking coins with his wife’s name on them—Cynethryth, the only Anglo-Saxon queen to be so honoured. It was a detail of shared power, of a boundary blurred between ruler and consort. A partnership. It was another piece of the complex human story she was trying to tell, another knot in the intricate tapestry of power, fear, and connection.

On the way home, she approached the footbridge without hesitation. The choice to cross it again was not a test of courage, but a simple matter of convenience. It was the quickest route, and so she took it. The apprehension was still there, a faint, instinctual tightening in her gut as she began the ascent, but it was a ghost, a muscle memory of a pain that had largely subsided. The train tracks below were just train tracks. The vibrations from the city’s traffic were just vibrations. She reached the other side and felt nothing more than the simple satisfaction of being a few minutes closer to home, and she realised that this was the true nature of victory. It wasn't a constant, thrilling high, but the quiet, unremarkable return of the ordinary. The ability to choose the quickest route. The freedom to not think about it.

The following weeks settled into a new, productive rhythm. The scaffolding remained, but it had been assimilated into her landscape, as much a part of her daily view as the canal barges and the weeping willows on the far bank. Her brief nods with The Singer became a regular occurrence, small, silent acknowledgements of their shared morning rituals. The work on her book flourished. She wrote with an authority that had previously eluded her, her prose infused with the hard-won knowledge of what it felt like to stand at an edge and not retreat. The dyke was no longer just a symbol of fear and division; it became a site of nuance, a place teeming with the complex, contradictory lives of those who patrolled it, traded across it, and yearned for what was on the other side. She was not just building a wall in her narrative; she was populating its borders, breathing life into the spaces in between.

Then, one Tuesday morning, the familiar sounds of construction changed. The metallic clangs were softer, more deliberate. The process was happening in reverse. They were taking the scaffolding down. Eleanor found herself watching, fascinated, as the structure that had so defined the last few weeks of her life was methodically dismantled. Piece by piece, the grid that had caged her view was removed, revealing ever-wider patches of unobstructed sky. The process was slow, taking several days, and with each section that disappeared, Eleanor felt a strange, dual sense of relief and loss. The scaffolding had been a constant, physical manifestation of her struggle, an externalisation of the internal cage she had built for herself. Watching it go felt like witnessing her own recovery, made tangible in steel and wood.

On the final day, only the platform directly outside her window remained. She watched as The Singer and The Foreman worked together, unbolting the final poles and lowering the last plank. Before he climbed down for the last time, The Singer caught her eye through the clean, unmarked glass. He raised a hand in a clear, friendly wave of farewell. Eleanor smiled and waved back, a gesture that felt as significant as any sentence she had written. Then he was gone. She was left with her window, her view, whole and uninterrupted for the first time in what felt like an age. The familiar panorama of the canal, the towpath, the red-brick warehouses on the opposite bank, all under a vast, open expanse of bruised-fruit sky, was achingly beautiful. The world had been returned to her, and it was wider and more wonderful than she remembered.

That evening, she stood at the open window, a thing she would not have dreamed of doing a month ago, and breathed in the cool, damp air. She could feel the faint, familiar vibration of the building, the deep hum of the city, but it was no longer a threat. It was a heartbeat. Her heartbeat. The world was still full of heights and drops, of fragile boundaries and vertiginous possibilities, but she was no longer their prisoner. She had walked the cliff edge, crossed the bridge, and reclaimed her own view. Her kingdom was no longer a second-floor fortress in a converted mill. It was the whole, sprawling, complicated city of Leeds, and all the territories beyond.

As if on cue, her laptop, sitting on her desk, chimed with the arrival of a new email. She padded over, curious, and her breath caught in her throat. The subject line read: ‘Keynote Invitation: Northern Early Medievalists Conference, Durham’. She opened it. It was from a professor she deeply admired, a giant in her field, inviting her to be the closing speaker at the annual conference in July. It was the most significant professional honour she had ever received. It was a recognition that her work, her voice, mattered. She scrolled down, her heart pounding with a mixture of pride and a new, different kind of fear. The conference was to be held at Durham University. A city built on a dramatic, rocky outcrop, its skyline dominated by the colossal, sky-piercing towers of its cathedral. The email helpfully included a link to the conference hotel, where a room had been provisionally reserved for her. She clicked it. A slick website loaded, showing a modern, glass-fronted hotel on the banks of the River Wear. The prime selling point, illustrated with a sweeping panoramic photograph, was the "stunning rooftop bar with unparalleled views of the cathedral and castle." Eleanor stared at the screen, at the picture of smiling people sipping cocktails against a backdrop of historic spires and a dizzying drop. The invitation wasn't just an honour; it was a map. It was a detailed itinerary of every single one of her former terrors, presented to her as a reward. She could say no. She could stay here, in her safe, quiet, newly liberated kingdom. Or she could pack a bag, write a speech, and go north to claim her seat at the table.The dismantling of the scaffolding began on a Tuesday, and the process was a quiet, methodical reversal of its violent construction. The sharp, aggressive clangs were replaced by the more considered sounds of bolts being loosened and poles being carefully passed down. Eleanor found herself watching from her desk, not with fear, but with a kind of detached fascination. For weeks, the metal grid had been the architecture of her anxiety, a constant, physical reminder of the barrier between her and the world. Now, piece by piece, it was coming down, and with each section removed, a slice of her view was returned. Light, broader and softer than she remembered, flooded back into her flat, reclaiming corners that had been lost to shadow. It felt like watching a wound heal in real time, the scar tissue of the metal grid slowly dissolving to reveal the healthy sky beneath.

On the final day, only the single platform directly outside her window remained. The Foreman and The Singer worked in tandem, their movements economical and practiced. Eleanor watched as they unbolted the last supports, their quiet conversation a low murmur through the glass. Before he prepared to descend for the last time, The Singer, the young man whose oblivious confidence had first so unsettled her, happened to glance towards the window. This time, he saw her clearly, sitting at her desk. A flicker of recognition crossed his face, and he raised a hand, not just in a brief nod, but in a clear, friendly wave of farewell. Without a moment's hesitation, Eleanor smiled and waved back. It was a simple, human gesture, a parting acknowledgement between two people who had briefly, strangely, shared a patch of sky. Then he was gone, and her window was empty, a clean, clear pane of glass separating her from nothing but the air and the city beyond.

That evening, the quiet in the flat was different. It was not the hollow silence of absence, nor the charged silence of a truce. It was a deep, calm, resonant quiet, the sound of a space returned to its rightful state. She stood before the window, her view whole and miraculously ordinary. The canal, the towpath, the familiar brick of the warehouses opposite, all of it sat under an open, uninterrupted expanse of sky. It was the same view she had looked at for five years, but it was as if she were seeing it for the first time, her vision scrubbed clean of the grime of fear. The world had not changed, but she had come back to it from a great distance, and the return made everything sharper, more precious. The city was not a threat; it was a landscape, and she was a part of it.

In the days that followed, she discovered the true, quiet nature of her recovery. It was not a grand, cinematic revelation, but a series of small, unremarkable freedoms. One afternoon, needing a specific book from the university library, she planned her route and found herself walking towards the iron footbridge without a second thought. The choice was not a test of courage, but a simple matter of logistics; it was the quickest way. As she ascended the metal steps, she felt a faint, ghostly echo of the old panic, a tightening in her stomach that was more muscle memory than genuine fear. A train rumbled underneath, and the structure vibrated, but she simply paused, holding the handrail, and waited for it to pass, an observer of a physical phenomenon, not its victim. Reaching the other side, she felt only the mild satisfaction of having saved herself ten minutes, and she understood that this was the real prize: the return of the mundane, the freedom to choose a path based on convenience rather than terror.

Her work flowed with a new and potent clarity. The experience of the cliffs, the bridge, and the scaffolding had given her a visceral, bodily understanding of what a boundary truly was—not just a line on a map, but a physical and psychological space that had to be navigated. She wrote about Offa’s Dyke not as a static monument, but as a living frontier, a place of tension and exchange, of fear and opportunity. Her research led her to Cynethryth, Offa's queen, the only Anglo-Saxon queen to have her name and image struck on coins. It was a detail of shared power, of a partnership so profound it was literally minted into the currency of the kingdom. Eleanor lingered on the image, this ancient testament to a bond that was not a liability or an embarrassment, but a source of strength. She wrote with a quiet authority, her own journey across internal borders infusing the historical narrative with a deep and resonant truth.

One afternoon, sitting at her desk in a pool of late sunlight, the flat quiet around her, her laptop chimed with the arrival of a new email. It was from a professor whose work she had admired for years, a titan in her field. The subject line was stark and thrilling: ‘Keynote Invitation: Northern Early Medievalists Conference, Durham’. Her heart gave a sudden, powerful thump. With trembling hands, she opened the message. It was a formal invitation to be the closing speaker at the annual conference in July, the most significant professional honour she had ever been offered. It was a declaration from the world she respected most that her work, her voice, had weight and value. A heady mix of pride and disbelief washed over her. She scrolled down for the details. The conference was to be held at Durham University, in the historic heart of the city, a place she knew was dominated by the colossal, sky-piercing towers of its cathedral. The email included a helpful link to the conference hotel, where a room had been provisionally reserved for her. She clicked it. A sleek website loaded, and the first image that filled her screen was a sweeping panoramic photograph taken from the hotel’s prime selling point: a chic, glass-fronted rooftop bar. In the picture, smiling, well-dressed people held glasses of wine against a backdrop of historic spires and a dizzying, spectacular drop. Eleanor stared at the screen, at the image of her greatest fear presented as the ultimate reward. The invitation was not just a validation of her work. It was a challenge, a dare, a map of the territory she had just fought so hard to escape, now being offered to her as the spoils of victory.For a long time, Eleanor did not move. She sat frozen in the glow of the laptop screen, the email a radiant tableau of her greatest desire and her deepest dread. The words of praise from the professor, the honour of the keynote address—it was the culmination of a decade of quiet, solitary work, a validation so profound it felt like a physical warmth spreading through her chest. But the warmth was instantly chilled by the photograph. The rooftop bar. It was an almost perfect replica of the scene of her unraveling, only this time it was infused with the prestige she had craved. The smiling people, the elegant glasses, the historic city spread out below like a map—it was a vision of the life Marcus had always wanted for her, the life of effortless, elevated success. The irony was a blade twisting in her gut. The world was offering her everything she ever wanted, but it was demanding she collect her prize from the top of the tower where the monster lived.

The initial euphoria of the invitation curdled into a slow, creeping despair. This was not a test she could choose, like the footbridge or the trip to Flamborough. This was a non-negotiable condition of her own success. To claim her place, she had to return to the site of her greatest vulnerability. The monster, which had been dormant for weeks, stirred and stretched, its voice no longer a panicked shriek but a low, reasonable, seductive whisper. *You don’t have to go,* it murmured. *You’ve come so far. You’ve found a balance. Why risk it all? You can plead illness. You can claim a clash of dates. No one will think less of you. Protect this peace you’ve built. The fortress is secure. Don’t leave it.* She closed the laptop with a sharp click, cutting off the image, but it was already burned into her mind. She began to pace the length of her flat, the familiar floorboards a geography she knew intimately, but her own mind was once again becoming a treacherous, foreign territory. The victory she had felt earlier in the day, the quiet confidence of the returned view and the conquered bridge, now felt fragile and naive, a child’s sandcastle about to be swept away by the tide.

She slept in fractured increments, waking repeatedly to the phantom sensation of falling, her heart racing in the silent darkness of the room. By morning, the internal debate had exhausted her. The pride and the fear had fought each other to a standstill, leaving her in a state of paralysed indecision. She knew she could not solve this alone. The dyke she had built was strong, but this new threat was a complex piece of psychological warfare, and she needed the counsel of her ally. She found herself dialling Sarah’s number before she had even finished her first cup of coffee, her thumb moving with an instinct for self-preservation. "I have a problem," she said, when Sarah’s bright, sleep-hoarse voice answered. "It’s the best problem I’ve ever had. And it’s also the worst."

They met in a small, cramped café near the university, a place with steamed-up windows and the rich, grounding smell of roasted coffee beans. Eleanor explained the situation in a low, rushed voice, sliding her phone across the table to show Sarah the email and the damning photograph of the hotel bar. She watched her friend’s face for a reaction, braced for commiseration, for an acknowledgement that this was an impossible, cruel twist of fate. Instead, after a moment of study, Sarah looked up and let out a short, sharp bark of laughter. The sound was so unexpected, so utterly devoid of pity, that Eleanor stared at her, nonplussed. "Oh, wow," Sarah said, shaking her head with a grin. "The universe really does have the sense of humour of a fourteen-year-old boy, doesn’t it? It’s perfect. It’s horrible. It’s perfectly, horribly brilliant." She pushed the phone back across the table. "So what are you worried about?"

"What am I—? Sarah, did you see the picture? It’s Angelica’s all over again, but with a cathedral. They’ll all be up there, networking, drinking prosecco, and I’ll be… what? Hiding in my room? Having another panic attack in a public place? It’s humiliating." The shame was a hot flush on her cheeks, the old fear of being seen as broken and irrational.
"Okay, first of all," Sarah said, leaning forward and lowering her voice, her expression turning serious. "The keynote speaker does not 'hide'. The keynote speaker holds court. And you can hold court wherever you damn well please. In the lobby. In the grimiest, oldest, most gloriously subterranean pub you can find in Durham. You get to set the terms, El. This isn't a command performance on a terrace where some idiot in a suit is trying to show you off. This is your stage. You own it." She took a sip of her coffee, her gaze sharp and focused. "And second, who says you have to go to the bar at all? And if you do, who says you have to stay? You could walk up there, take one look, say, ‘Right, that’s quite high,’ and walk back down again. You have all the power here. The fear is real, I get that. But the choice, every single choice, is yours."

Eleanor listened, the simple, practical logic of Sarah’s words cutting through the fog of her anxiety. She had been seeing the event as a single, monolithic, terrifying entity: The Conference. But Sarah had dissected it into a series of small, manageable moments, each with its own choice. A choice of where to meet people. A choice of how long to stay in any given location. A choice to leave. She had been so focused on the one part of the experience that terrified her that she had forgotten about all the other parts that she could control. She had forgotten about her own agency, the very thing she had fought so hard to reclaim. The fear was a landscape, but she was the one holding the map and compass. She didn't have to march directly over the highest, most treacherous peak just because it was there. She could navigate.

Back in her flat, the silence felt different again. It was the quiet of contemplation, of a decision waiting to be made not from a place of fear or bravado, but from a place of calm consideration. She walked over to her desk and looked at her notes on Queen Cynethryth. She pictured the small, silver coin, the queen’s profile stamped opposite her husband’s, a woman claiming her space in the official, permanent record of her time. The invitation to Durham was Eleanor’s coin. It was her chance to have her own image, her own ideas, minted and circulated. To refuse would be to consign herself to the footnotes, to remain a consort to her own life rather than its co-ruler. She opened her laptop, the screen illuminating her face in the quiet room. She navigated back to the email, the draft of a polite refusal still hovering in her mind. Then she looked past the laptop, through the clear, unobstructed glass of her window, at the vast and open sky over Leeds. It was a writer’s sky, a sky that didn’t demand cheerfulness. A sky big enough to hold a little bit of fear. She took a breath, placed her fingers on the keyboard, and began to type her reply. "Dear Professor Davies," she wrote. "Thank you so much for your generous invitation. I would be absolutely delighted to accept."## Chapter 9

The word ‘delighted’ hung in the quiet of her flat, a lie and a truth tangled together so tightly they had become indistinguishable. The moment she hit ‘send’, a vertiginous wave of panic and exhilaration washed over her, a feeling more potent than any she had experienced on a cliff edge. She had not just accepted an invitation; she had made a pact with her future self, a reckless promise that in two months’ time, she would be a woman capable of standing on a rooftop in a strange city, a woman who could command a room and not be commanded by her own fear. For a long while she sat motionless, her hand still resting on the laptop, as if she could feel the faint electronic pulse of her commitment speeding its way north. The fortress was no longer a fortress. She had just mailed the key to a potential invader, and now all she could do was prepare for the siege.

Her first and most natural defence was work. She threw herself into the crafting of the keynote speech with the obsessive focus of a master strategist preparing for battle. The topic, she decided, would not be Offa and his dyke, not the grand, masculine statement of power and division. Instead, she would focus on the coin, on Cynethryth. She would build her address around the queen whose presence had been deemed worthy of the kingdom’s currency, exploring the porous boundaries between public and private power, between the official record and the lived experience of women in a world defined by male ambition. The speech became her shield and her sword. In the archives of the library, she felt invincible, tracking down obscure charters and debating the nuances of late Mercian iconography. The intellectual rigour was a familiar, comforting weight. This was her ground, her territory. If she had to stand on a terrifying precipice, she would do so armed with the heaviest, most unshakeable artillery of knowledge she could muster. The speech would not just be a performance; it would be her declaration of who she was, a complex, layered argument that she hoped would be more memorable than any fleeting moment of social anxiety.

A week before the conference, she met Sarah for what they had morbidly dubbed ‘The Final Supper’. They sat in a cozy Italian restaurant in a converted cellar near the Corn Exchange, a subterranean space that felt like the safest place in the world. Over bowls of pasta and cheap red wine, they drew up a plan. Sarah, with the cheerful pragmatism of a field archaeologist planning a dig in hostile territory, broke it down into manageable stages. “Operation Durham,” she announced, sketching on a napkin. “Phase one: Reconnaissance. We use the internet. We find the three oldest, darkest, most ground-floor pubs within a five-minute walk of the hotel. These are your fallback positions. Phase two: Base Camp. Your hotel room is your sovereign territory. You do not have to leave it for anyone. You can order room service and call it ‘strategic seclusion’. Phase three: The Social Offensive. You do not go to the rooftop bar because you are supposed to. You only go if you feel like it, for exactly as long as you feel like it, and you go with an exit strategy. If you stay for five minutes and decide it’s awful, you declare victory and retreat to a pre-approved pub. Mission accomplished.” The act of turning her profound, existential dread into a set of comical, logistical steps was a masterstroke of friendship. It made the monster seem not just smaller, but faintly ridiculous.

The last days before the conference passed in a flurry of activity. Eleanor rehearsed her speech to the empty flat, her voice growing stronger and more confident with each repetition. She packed her suitcase with the deliberate care of a soldier packing her kit. She chose her clothes like armour: a sharply tailored jacket for the speech itself; her comfortable, worn leather boots that knew the feel of solid ground; a soft cashmere jumper that felt like a hug. Tucked between the layers of clothing was her constant companion, a fresh, hard-backed notebook, its blank pages a promise of control, a space where she could impose her own order on whatever chaos the world presented. On the morning of her departure, as she stood by the door ready to leave, she took one last look at her flat, her safe harbour. The room was filled with the gentle morning light, the bookshelves stood as silent, loyal guards, the desk was clear save for a single stack of research books. It was a kingdom at peace. The thought of leaving it, of voluntarily walking out of its gates and towards the front line, was still terrifying. But it was no longer unthinkable.

The train journey north was a strange, suspended passage through time. Eleanor watched the familiar red brick of West Yorkshire give way to the softer greens and greys of North Yorkshire and then County Durham. The train was a controlled environment, a metal tube hurtling through the landscape, and she felt a sense of calm detachment, an observer watching the world scroll past her window. She didn't try to read or work. She simply sat, feeling the rhythm of the tracks beneath her, a steady, forward momentum. This was happening. She was not running away. With every mile they covered, her decision solidified, the abstract commitment of the email hardening into the irreversible reality of approach. The anxiety was a low hum beneath the surface, like the vibration of the train itself, but above it was a clear, sharp sense of purpose. She had a speech to give. She had a point to prove, not just to the academic world, but to the woman she had been a few months ago, the one who couldn't cross a footbridge.

The first glimpse of Durham from the taxi window was a physical blow. The city did not sit on the landscape; it erupted from it. Perched on a high, wooded peninsula, encircled by the dramatic loop of the River Wear, the cathedral dominated everything. It was not a building; it was a statement, a colossal work of stone and faith that had commanded this view for nearly a thousand years. It was magnificent and utterly intimidating. And then she saw the hotel. On the opposite bank of the river, a sleek, modern structure of glass and steel, its clean, horizontal lines a deliberate contrast to the ancient, vertical power of the cathedral. From its highest level, the rooftop bar glinted in the afternoon sun, a clinical, man-made ledge designed for staring at the very thing that made this city so vertiginously spectacular. The taxi pulled up to the hotel's entrance. The automatic glass doors slid open with a soft hiss, revealing a cool, minimalist lobby. Eleanor paid the driver, pulled her suitcase from the boot, and stood on the pavement, her bag in one hand, her notebook in the other. She took a breath and looked up, past the clean lines of the building, to the glinting glass of the rooftop bar, and then across the river, to the immense, unshakeable towers of Durham Cathedral. Her battleground, in all its terrible, beautiful glory, lay before her.## Chapter 10

With a breath that felt borrowed from the future, Eleanor pushed through the revolving doors and into the hotel lobby. The transition was absolute. She left the ancient, breathing city behind and entered a sterile, climate-controlled vacuum. The air was cool and scented with something vaguely citrusy and expensive. The floor was polished black marble that reflected the recessed lighting like a dark, still lake. Low, minimalist sofas were arranged in stark, uninviting conversational pits. It was a space designed for transient, high-value people, a non-place of polished surfaces and quiet efficiency. It was Marcus’s world. The thought landed not with a pang of loss, but with the dispassionate clarity of a diagnosis. This was the architecture of the life she had escaped, and her body registered its foreignness with an instinctive clenching of her muscles.

At the check-in desk, a young woman with a flawless smile and a crisp uniform greeted her. The process was smooth and frictionless. A key card was produced. A map of the hotel was offered. “You’re on the fifth floor, Dr. Vance,” the receptionist said, her voice bright. “The lifts are just to your left. The welcome reception is at seven in the Observatory Bar, on the roof. I do hope you enjoy the view.” The casual, well-rehearsed line felt like a small, sharp jab. Even here, the view was the main attraction, the assumed desire of every guest. Eleanor thanked her, her own voice sounding thin in the cavernous space. She turned towards the lifts, her suitcase trailing behind her, its small wheels making an embarrassingly loud rumble on the silent marble. The lift doors were brushed steel, seamless and intimidating. This was the first test. It was not a glass box on the outside of a building, but it was still a cage designed to defy gravity. She thought of Sarah’s voice: *You get in, you breathe, you get out. It’s just a box.* She pressed the button, and the doors slid open with a soft, expensive sigh. She stepped inside, her heart beginning its familiar, frantic beat, and fixed her eyes on the small screen above the door, watching the numbers ascend. Four. Five. The doors opened again onto a silent, softly lit corridor. She had made it. It was a small, unglamorous victory, but it was a victory nonetheless.

Her room was a carbon copy of the lobby: sleek, impersonal, and flawlessly grey. A king-sized bed, a minimalist desk, a single, abstract painting on the wall. It was a room designed to be forgotten the moment you left it. But she could not forget the window. It took up the entire far wall, a vast, floor-to-ceiling sheet of glass that perfectly framed a view of such staggering, theatrical beauty it felt like a special effect. The cathedral and castle stood on their peninsula, floodlit against the darkening sky, their ancient, honey-coloured stone glowing with an internal fire. The river coiled around them like a dark moat, its surface reflecting the lights from the bridges. It was breathtaking. And it was terrifying. The sheer, plunging drop from her window to the riverbank below was an integral part of the composition. There was no escaping it. Her "Base Camp," her "sovereign territory," had the enemy’s greatest weapon mounted on its primary wall. Taking another deep breath, Eleanor resolutely walked past the window, refusing to let it be the first thing she engaged with. She dropped her suitcase on the luggage rack, the thud a satisfying, solid sound. She took out her laptop, her speech, and her notebook, and arranged them on the desk, creating a small island of familiar, manageable order in the vast, intimidating space. This was her command centre. The view could wait.

For the next two hours, she rehearsed. She stood and paced the narrow strip of carpet between the bed and the desk, speaking her carefully crafted sentences into the quiet air of the room. She spoke of Cynethryth’s ambition, of the power of coinage, of the subtle ways women wrote themselves into the historical record. The sound of her own voice, steady and authoritative, was a grounding force. The complex arguments, the layered evidence, the narrative she had spent months building—this was her true territory. This was the dyke she had built not of fear, but of knowledge. The fear of her immediate surroundings began to recede, overshadowed by the more familiar, manageable anxiety of a scholar about to present her life’s work. When she finally stopped, her throat dry, the clock on her phone read 6:45. The welcome reception. The Observatory Bar. The rooftop.

She stood before the full-length mirror, her heart beginning its slow, heavy ascent into a panicked rhythm. She was wearing a simple, dark green dress and her worn leather boots—her concession to professionalism and her anchor to the ground. She looked pale. The woman in the mirror looked like an academic, but her eyes were wide with a familiar, hunted expression. The monster was awake and it was singing its siren song of retreat. *Room service,* it whispered. *A bottle of wine. Your speech is ready. You don’t need this. Why put yourself through it?* She closed her eyes and saw Sarah’s hand, sketching on a napkin. *Phase Three: The Social Offensive.* A five-minute victory. A tactical strike, not a fight to the death. She could do five minutes. She opened her eyes, met her own gaze in the mirror, and gave a small, firm nod. She picked up her key card, slipped it into her pocket, and walked out of the room.

The second lift ride was a conscious act of will. This time, as she pressed the button for the roof, she was not just ascending to a floor; she was rising to meet the challenge head-on. The smooth, silent climb felt impossibly long. When the doors finally slid open, she was met not with a quiet lobby but with a wall of sound and light. The chatter of dozens of conversations, the clinking of glasses, the cool rush of the evening wind, and a view that snatched the breath from her lungs. The terrace was crowded. Academics she had only ever seen as names on a page were standing in small groups, laughing, gesturing, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of lanterns. And beyond them, the view. The floodlit cathedral was no longer a picture in a window; it was a real, colossal presence, so close it felt as if you could reach out and touch the ancient stone. The city lights glittered below, a sprawling carpet of jewels. It was the most beautiful, terrifying place she had ever been.

She stayed where she was for a moment, just inside the doors, her back against the reassuring solidity of the lift’s wall, a soldier taking cover. Her plan was to stay for five minutes, but the thought of navigating that crowded space, of initiating a conversation, felt like an impossible task. Her heart was hammering, a frantic bird against the cage of her ribs. Just as she was about to declare a premature defeat and press the button to go back down, a woman with a sharp, silver haircut and kind, intelligent eyes detached herself from a nearby group and walked towards her. “Dr. Vance? Eleanor?” she said, her voice warm and welcoming. “I’m Anne Davies. I am so, so glad you could make it.” It was her, the professor who had invited her. This was it. There was no retreat now. “Professor Davies,” Eleanor managed, her voice tight but steady. “It’s an honour to be here.”

“Oh, please, call me Anne,” she said, her smile genuine. “We are all so looking forward to your paper tomorrow. Cynethryth is a brave choice. Fascinating.” She gestured towards the view. “Quite the spot, isn’t it? A bit dramatic for my taste, I prefer a dusty archive, but the organisers insisted.” That small admission, that casual confession of a preference for the subterranean over the spectacular, was a lifeline. It was an echo of Sarah, a quiet acknowledgement that not everyone was enthralled by heights. The knot of panic in Eleanor’s chest loosened, just a fraction. “It’s… impressive,” Eleanor said, the word a masterpiece of neutrality. Anne chuckled. “That’s one word for it. Come, let me introduce you to Michael Albright. He’s been working on the Mercian charters and I know he’s dying to talk to you.”

Before she could protest, Eleanor was being gently steered towards a small group of people. The conversation flowed around her, a high-level, rapid-fire discussion of charters and place-names. She was on her home ground, intellectually speaking, but her body was still on high alert, every nerve ending screaming about the low glass barrier and the sheer drop just a few feet away. Someone pressed a glass of sparkling water into her hand. She held it, her fingers cold against the condensation, and found herself contributing to the conversation, citing a source, offering a counter-argument. Her professional self, a well-trained and formidable entity, had taken the stage, while the terrified part of her huddled in the wings, watching in disbelief. She had been on the terrace for ten minutes, then fifteen. She was talking, listening, even smiling. And then she made the mistake of glancing over the shoulder of the man she was talking to, out into the vast, dark emptiness beyond the city lights, and for a terrifying second, the world tilted. The monster roared. She faltered, losing the thread of her sentence, the glass shaking in her hand.The words died in her throat. The carefully constructed argument about Mercian charters dissolved into meaningless noise, drowned out by the roar of blood in her ears. The man she was speaking to, Michael Albright, frowned slightly, a flicker of polite confusion in his eyes. He couldn't see the abyss that had just opened up behind him, the vast, hungry darkness that was pulling the world out of focus. Her hand trembled, and the ice in her water clinked against the glass, a tiny, frantic alarm bell. This was it. The collapse. The public humiliation she had dreaded. But just as the world began to fracture, Anne Davies, who had been listening with a quiet, focused intensity, smoothly intervened. She placed a light, steadying hand on Eleanor’s arm. The touch was barely there, but it was a solid point in a tilting universe. "Michael, you’re making her work too hard and we haven’t even fed her yet," she said, her voice laced with a warm, easy authority. "Eleanor, I’m so sorry, we’ve ambushed you. You must be exhausted after your journey."

The simple, generous act of creating an excuse for her, of attributing her faltering to fatigue rather than panic, was a gift of such profound grace that it broke the spell. It was an anchor thrown to a drowning woman. Eleanor gripped it. She focused on the feeling of Anne’s hand on her arm, a point of human warmth and pressure. She focused on the cold, solid reality of the glass in her own hand. She drew a breath, a ragged, shaky thing, but a breath nonetheless. The world swam back into focus. The roaring in her ears subsided. The monster, denied its catastrophic climax, retreated with a sullen snarl. She had stood on the brink, felt the pull of the void, and had been gently, expertly, talked back from the ledge. "I’m so sorry," she said, her voice a little shaky but her own. "A momentary blank. It’s been a long day." She had not crumbled. She had not fled. She had faltered, and she had recovered.

She knew, however, that she had reached her limit. The skirmish had been won, but her defences were depleted. It was time for the tactical retreat Sarah had planned. She offered a genuine, if weary, smile to the group. "It has been such a pleasure to meet you all," she said, her voice gaining strength. "Professor Davies—Anne—thank you for the introduction. I think I am going to call it a night, if you’ll all forgive me. I want to be fresh for tomorrow." There were murmurs of understanding, handshakes, and promises to continue the conversation after her speech. Anne gave her arm a final, encouraging squeeze. "A very wise decision," she said, her eyes conveying a depth of understanding that went far beyond the polite fiction of her words. "Rest well. We’re all very excited." With a final nod, Eleanor turned and walked, with a deliberate, unhurried pace, back towards the lifts. She did not run. She did not look back. She pressed the button, stepped inside, and as the doors slid shut, sealing her off from the noise and the wind and the terrifying, beautiful view, she finally allowed her shoulders to slump.

Back in the quiet sanctuary of her room, she leaned against the closed door, her body trembling with the aftershocks of adrenaline. But the overwhelming emotion was not the familiar, cold shame of failure. It was a fierce, wild, unfamiliar surge of triumph. She had done it. She had walked onto the rooftop, she had engaged with her peers, she had faced down the monster at its most powerful, and she had walked away on her own terms. She had not been an embarrassment; she had been a scholar, a colleague, a person. She had been herself. She slid down the door until she was sitting on the floor, the plush carpet a surprising comfort, and she began to laugh. It was a breathless, slightly hysterical sound, the laugh of someone who has just survived a shipwreck. She had faced the worst, and the worst had turned out to be manageable.

After a long time, she stood up, her legs stiff, and walked not to her desk, but to the great, floor-to-ceiling window. The night was clear, and the view was laid out before her like a promise. The cathedral glowed, a mountain of faith and history, its towers solid and reassuring against the dark sky. The city lights sparkled, each one a small, contained world. It was the same view that had terrified her hours before, but she was looking at it with new eyes. She had been on the other side of the river, at the highest point, and had returned. The view no longer felt like a threat looming over her, but a landscape she was a part of. She thought of her speech, of Cynethryth’s coin, a small, silver object that had travelled through centuries, a tangible piece of a woman’s power. She felt a sudden, fierce kinship with the long-dead queen. Tomorrow, she would stand on a stage and mint her own ideas into the shared currency of her field. She pressed her hand against the cool, solid glass of the window, feeling the faint, deep vibration of the city. She was not falling. She was here. And she was ready.
