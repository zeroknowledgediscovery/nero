The silence in the apartment was a living thing, thick and heavy like the August humidity that seeped through the window frames. It pressed in on Catalina, a physical weight on her shoulders as she stared at the telephone. It was an old rotary, a black plastic fossil her abuela refused to replace, and it sat on its doilied throne like a malevolent idol. For three days, it had been her tormentor. Every creak of the floorboards, every shout from the street vendors on Avenida Medrano, sent a phantom jolt through her, the ghost of a ring that never came. She’d scrubbed the same spot on the kitchen floor until the tile’s pattern had faded, rearranged the tiny ceramic figurines on the mantelpiece a dozen times, and had chewed the nail on her right thumb down to the quick.

Her mother, Marta, moved around her with a practiced, weary grace, the scent of sizzling garlic and onions clinging to her apron. “Catita, por favor. Come and eat. You’ll make yourself sick.”

Catalina shook her head, her gaze unbroken from the black plastic beast. “I can’t, Mamá. Not yet.”

“They said by Tuesday. It is Thursday, mija. Maybe next year.” Marta’s voice was gentle, cushioned with the soft resignation of a life filled with disappointments. She wanted to protect her daughter, to wrap her in the familiar blanket of lowered expectations. But Catalina’s hope was a different creature, fierce and stubborn, a stray cat she had fed and could not now abandon.

Then it happened. Not the shrill, demanding ring she had imagined, but a soft, almost polite *brrr-ing* that was somehow more terrifying. The sound sliced through the thick silence, and Catalina felt her heart leap into her throat. Marta froze, a wooden spoon dripping tomato sauce halfway to the pot. From the small back bedroom, the tinny explosions from her brother Leo’s video game abruptly ceased. Three days of waiting, and the moment was suddenly, violently, here.

The phone rang a second time. It seemed to mock her. *See? I am real.* Catalina’s hand trembled as she reached for the receiver. It felt slick and cold, heavy as a stone. She lifted it to her ear, her breath catching.

“¿Hola?” Her voice was a reedy whisper, a stranger’s voice.

“¿Señorita Catalina Morales?” The man on the other end was clipped, professional. His Spanish was too perfect, lacking the lazy, musical lilt of a true porteño. He sounded like a television.

“Sí… soy yo.”

“Le hablo de la producción de ‘Corazón de la Canción’. We are calling to inform you of the judges’ final decision.” A pause. Catalina’s knuckles were white where she gripped the receiver. The entire world seemed to shrink to the space between her ear and the plastic earpiece, a universe of crackling static and possibilities. The producer cleared his throat, a dry, rustling sound. “Felicitaciones, Señorita Morales. You are one of our three finalists. You will be competing for the grand prize next Saturday, live on television.”

The words didn’t register at first. They were just sounds, syllables without meaning. Finalist. Live. Saturday. Then, they clicked into place, like tumblers in a lock, and a door swung open inside her. She didn’t feel joy, not yet. She felt a dizzying, terrifying lightness, as if the floor had dropped away and she was floating in the stuffy air of the apartment.

“Señorita? ¿Sigue ahí?”

“Sí,” she managed, the word a gasp. “Sí, estoy aquí.”

“Your preliminary sound check and wardrobe fitting is scheduled for tomorrow at nine in the morning at the Telecentro studios in Martínez. A car will be sent for you at seven-thirty. Do not be late.”

He said more, something about contracts and song choices, but his voice was a distant buzz. Catalina’s gaze drifted past the phone, past her mother’s stunned face, to the small, framed photograph on the wall. It was her father, his smile wide and handsome, taken a year before the construction accident. He was holding a guitar. He had been a singer, too, in smoky peñas and neighborhood bars, his voice a river of tango and heartbreak. She felt a sudden, sharp pang of connection, a sense that this wasn't just for her.

The producer had stopped talking. “Gracias,” she whispered, and without waiting for a reply, she let the heavy receiver slip from her fingers. It didn’t fall to the cradle. It swung on its coiled cord, striking the wall with a dull clack. And then the scream that had been building inside her for three days, for nineteen years, finally tore itself free. It was not a scream of fear or pain, but of pure, unrefined elation, a sound so loud and full of life it seemed to shake the very foundations of the old building.

Marta was there first, wrapping her arms around her, her earlier weariness forgotten. “¡Ay, mi Catita! ¡Mi amor! ¡Lo hiciste!” Leo skidded into the room in his socks, his face alight with a rare, genuine smile, abandoning his digital wars for the real-life victory in their living room. And then came Abuela Elena, shuffling from her room, her face a beautiful, cracked landscape of wrinkles, her dark eyes, usually clouded with memory, now sharp and bright with tears.

“It is the blood,” Elena said, her voice raspy with emotion as she took Catalina’s face in her frail, papery hands. “The blood of your grandfather. He never saw a big stage, but his soul was a cathedral. Tonight, he sings in heaven.”

The tiny apartment, which so often felt like a cage of worries and unpaid bills, was transformed. It became a vessel of pure celebration. Marta, crying and laughing, declared it a fiesta and produced a dusty bottle of sparkling cider from the back of a cupboard. Leo cranked up a cumbia station on the radio, the beat thumping through the floor. They danced, a clumsy, joyous tangle of bodies in the narrow space between the sofa and the dining table. Catalina, dizzy with the cider and the shock of it all, let her head fall back and laughed, a real, full-throated laugh that came from her belly. She looked around at her family, their faces flushed with a happiness she had put there, and a fierce, protective love swelled in her chest. This was why. This was for them.

Later, when the initial euphoria had softened into a warm, glowing contentment, she stood by the open window, letting the cool night air wash over her face. The cacophony of Buenos Aires rose up to meet her—the growl of a distant colectivo, the mournful sigh of a bandoneon from a neighbor’s window, the laughter of students spilling out of a corner pizzeria. It was her city. It was loud, and broken, and beautiful, and it was in her veins as much as her grandfather’s blood. She had sung its sorrows and its joys in every audition, her voice carrying the stories of these streets, of the jacaranda trees that bled purple onto the pavement in November, of the silent anguish in the faded photographs of the disappeared, of the defiant pride in a tango danced on a cobbled square.

Her mother came to stand beside her, wrapping a thin shawl around her shoulders. “You are a good girl, Catalina. You have a pure heart. This world you are entering… it is not always kind to pure hearts.”

Catalina understood what she wasn’t saying. Her mother saw her daughter’s virginity not as a moral victory, but as a symbol of her innocence, a fragile shell that the world of television, with its slick producers and cynical ambitions, would delight in cracking. Catalina had never had a boyfriend. Boys had tried, drawn to her quiet intensity and the startling contrast between her shy demeanor and the volcano of passion that erupted when she sang. But her focus had always been singular. Music was her first, her only, love. It demanded a fidelity that left no room for fumbling explorations in darkened cinema halls or whispered promises over coffee.

“I will be careful, Mamá,” she promised, though she felt a tremor of fear. The producer’s voice, so cold and transactional. The world he represented felt a million miles away from this small apartment, from the scent of her mother’s milanesas and the comforting weight of her abuela’s hand.

“Just… be you, Catita. Your voice is a gift from God because it is honest. Do not let them make it into a lie.”

The next morning, the black sedan arrived precisely at seven-thirty. It was so clean it seemed to repel the grit of the city, an alien craft from another planet. When Catalina stepped out of her building, dressed in her best simple blue dress, the driver, a man in a crisp suit, held the door for her. Neighbors peeked from their windows. Old Señor Rodriguez, walking his terrier, stopped and stared. Catalina felt a blush creep up her neck. She was no longer just Catita Morales from apartment 3B. She was becoming someone else.

The drive to Martínez was a journey through different worlds. They left the chaotic, crumbling elegance of Almagro, moved through the leafy, monied quiet of Belgrano, and then onto the vast highway, a river of steel and speed. The Telecentro studio was a colossal, windowless block of concrete, a fortress of entertainment. Inside, the air was chilled and smelled of fresh paint and ozone. A harried young woman with a headset and a clipboard ticked her name off a list and pointed her down a long, white corridor. “Wardrobe is second on the left, then soundstage four for the check. Don’t get lost.”

The pressure began to build, a tight band around her chest. The warmth of yesterday’s celebration felt a lifetime away. Here, there were no loving faces, only the brisk, impersonal efficiency of people with jobs to do. In the wardrobe department, a flamboyant man with a measuring tape draped around his neck looked at her blue dress with undisguised pity. “Oh, sweetie. No. We need to find you something with… presence.” He began pulling garments from racks, shimmering fabrics and daring necklines that made Catalina’s skin prickle with anxiety.

She was poked, prodded, and eventually squeezed into a crimson dress that felt entirely unlike herself. It was beautiful, but it was a costume. It was for a character, a singer named Catalina, not for her.

Her unease deepened when she walked onto soundstage four. It was a cavern of darkness and technology. A web of steel scaffolding hung in the air, bristling with lights. Cables snaked across the floor like thick, black pythons. A gigantic screen flickered behind the stage, showing abstract, swirling colors. The place was teeming with crew members, their shouted commands and crackling radios forming a disorienting symphony.

Her fellow finalists were already there. There was Ricardo, the one with the oleaginous charm and the perfectly coiffed hair, who had breezed through the semi-finals with a string of predictable romantic ballads. He gave her a lazy, dismissive glance, his eyes lingering on the crimson dress for a moment too long. The other finalist was a duo, two brothers from Salta with weathered faces and brilliant harmonies who played their own charangos. They nodded at her with a quiet, professional courtesy.

A stage manager directed her to the center mark. The floor felt unsteady beneath her heels. “Just a level check, Catalina. Sing the first verse of the song you submitted. A cappella.”

She took a breath, the cold, artificial air stinging her lungs. She felt small and fraudulent in her borrowed dress, a little girl from Almagro playing dress-up. The faces in the darkness were just silhouettes, their features erased by the glare of the work lights. She could feel dozens of eyes on her. Doubts, sharp and cold, pierced through her. What was she doing here? Her mother was right. She didn't belong.

Then she thought of her abuela’s words. *His soul was a cathedral.* She thought of her father’s smile. She closed her eyes, shutting out the intimidating darkness, the judgmental silhouettes, the coldness of the room. She was not in a television studio. She was back in her living room, with the scent of garlic in the air and the warmth of her family around her. She was on a cobbled street in San Telmo, with the Sunday sun on her face. She opened her mouth, and the song came.

It was an old folk song, a Zamba her grandfather used to sing. Her voice, at first, was a fragile thread in the vast space. But it was pure. It was honest. As the verse built, the thread became a rope, then a vibrant tapestry of sound. It filled the cavernous stage, silencing the crackle of radios and the shouted commands. It spoke of dusty earth, of lost love, of the unyielding hope of the human heart. It was her voice. It was her truth.

When she finished, a profound silence held the room for a beat. Then, someone in the darkness began to clap. A slow, solitary sound. The crew turned. Ricardo’s smirk had vanished, replaced by a look of grudging respect. The brothers from Salta were smiling openly now. Catalina opened her eyes, her heart hammering not with fear, but with a dawning sense of power. She had done it. She had found her footing.

From his seat in the darkened tenth row of the empty auditorium, a man in an impeccably tailored suit watched her, unblinking. He was not looking at a gifted young singer. He was looking at an asset, a complication. His jaw was tight. He had hoped she would be a fraud, a provincial girl whose talent wilted under the lights. But the voice… the voice was a problem. It was authentic. It was undeniable. It would make what he had to do so much more difficult, and so much more necessary. He took a small, discreet photograph with his phone, the tiny click swallowed by the cavernous space. Then he stood up and walked away, a shadow disappearing into other shadows.The solitary clap was joined by another, then another, until a wave of spontaneous applause filled the soundstage. Technicians lowered their tools, producers on headsets turned from their monitors, and for a moment, the relentless machinery of television production paused to acknowledge something human. The stage manager, a man named Gustavo with a weary face and kind eyes, walked toward her, a genuine smile crinkling their corners. He took the microphone from her unresisting hand.

“Okay, that’s a level,” he said into his radio, but his eyes were on Catalina. “We’re good here.” He lowered the radio and spoke to her quietly, his voice a low rumble. “Don’t ever lose that, kid. That thing you just did. They’ll try to sand it down, polish it, put it in a different box. Don’t let them.” It was the second warning she’d received in less than twenty-four hours, and it landed with more weight here, in the heart of the beast itself.

She offered a weak, grateful smile, her knees still feeling watery. As the crew returned to their clamor, she saw the brothers from Salta, whose names she learned were Mateo and Javier, approaching her. The older one, Mateo, held out a calloused hand. “That was something special, compañera. A voice from the earth.” His praise was simple and sincere, carrying the same authenticity as their music. Javier, younger and shyer, simply nodded in agreement, his dark eyes wide with an artist’s appreciation. There was no rivalry in their gaze, only a shared respect for the craft.

Ricardo, however, was a different story. He sauntered over, his earlier dismissal replaced by a slick, predatory interest. “Not bad, little bird. You’ve got some pipes.” He let his gaze trail down the crimson dress again, a proprietary look that made Catalina’s skin crawl. “That old-fashioned stuff plays well with the grandmas, but it won’t win you the final. You need something with more… fire. Maybe I can help you find it.” He winked, and Catalina felt a hot flush of anger and embarrassment. She simply turned her back on him, walking toward the brothers, a small, defiant act that felt as significant as her song. Ricardo chuckled, unbothered, and strolled away to flirt with a makeup artist.

Her day was a blur of such encounters, a gauntlet of overwhelming new experiences. After wardrobe and the sound check came the meeting about contracts. She was led not to a sterile office, but to a plush suite of rooms on the top floor, a world of deep carpets, polished wood, and panoramic views of the city. The man waiting for her was not the clipped producer from the phone but the same impeccably dressed man who had watched her from the shadows of the auditorium. He introduced himself as Damián Ferrari, the show’s Executive Producer. His handshake was firm and cool, his smile perfectly calibrated but reaching nowhere near his eyes.

“Señorita Morales. Catalina. A pleasure,” he said, gesturing for her to sit on a leather sofa that probably cost more than her family’s rent for a year. “Your performance just now was… remarkable. Truly. You have a very raw, very marketable authenticity.” The word ‘marketable’ hung in the air, turning the compliment into a commodity. He slid a thick sheaf of papers across the coffee table. “Your contract. Standard for all finalists. It covers everything from song rights to public appearances for the next two years, should you win. And even if you don't, we retain certain options. Have your people look it over.”

Catalina stared at the dense block of legal text. Her people? She thought of Abuela Elena trying to read the fine print with her magnifying glass, of her mother who trusted everyone, of Leo who only read video game lore. “I… I don’t have ‘people’, Señor Ferrari.”

His smile tightened almost imperceptibly. “Of course. A figure of speech. We can provide a list of network-approved lawyers, if you wish. But I assure you, it’s all boilerplate. A formality.” He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a confidential, conspiratorial tone. “Look, Catalina. You have a gift. A tremendous gift. But a gift is not enough in this business. You need guidance. You need shaping. This show, this contract… this is your golden ticket. It’s the opportunity to escape a life of… well, a life of scrubbing floors in Almagro. You understand.”

The casual, cruel accuracy of his words struck her like a physical blow. He had researched her. He knew where she lived, what her mother did. The mention of scrubbing floors wasn't a guess; it was a calculated pinprick, designed to remind her of her place, of how much she had to lose. All the newfound power she had felt on the stage evaporated, replaced by the familiar chill of vulnerability. He wasn't offering a golden ticket; he was showing her the gilded bars of a cage. She suddenly felt her mother’s warning not as a vague fear, but as a clear and present danger. This man, with his cold eyes and transactional soul, was exactly what she had been talking about.

“I will… I’ll have it looked at,” Catalina murmured, pulling the heavy document toward her. Her hands were trembling again. She just wanted to go home.

Damián sat back, apparently satisfied. He had planted the seeds of fear and desire, a potent combination. “Excellent. We’re all very excited to work with you, Catalina. You’re going to be a star.” The word sounded less like a promise and more like a sentence. He stood, signaling the end of the meeting, his attention already shifting to the phone buzzing on his desk. She was dismissed.

The car ride home was silent. Catalina clutched the contract to her chest, its weight a physical manifestation of her anxiety. The city spooled past her window in reverse, the sleek highways giving way to the bustling, familiar streets of her own barrio. When the black sedan pulled up to her building, it seemed even more out of place than it had in the morning. Señor Rodriguez and his terrier were there again, and this time he tipped his hat to her. The news was already spreading. She was no longer just Catita. She was a finalist. A local girl on her way to something bigger. But as she climbed the worn stairs to apartment 3B, a knot of dread tightened in her stomach. Bigger, she was beginning to realize, did not necessarily mean better.When she pushed open the door to 3B, the apartment embraced her with a wall of heat and the glorious smell of her mother’s milanesas frying. The celebratory cider from last night had been replaced by the comforting, everyday reality of their lives. Marta turned from the stove, her face flushed and beaming, wiping her hands on her apron. Leo was at the table, not glued to a screen but actually setting out plates, a task he usually performed with the enthusiasm of a condemned man. He looked up and grinned, a genuine, unguarded expression that made him look years younger. The entire atmosphere was charged with a giddy, hopeful energy that felt worlds away from the refrigerated corridors of Telecentro.

“There she is! Our star!” Marta cried, rushing to hug her, her embrace smelling of breadcrumbs and optimism. “Tell us everything! Was it glamorous? Did you see anyone famous? What did they have you wear?” The questions tumbled out, a waterfall of vicarious excitement, leaving no room for the complicated truth. Catalina wanted to tell them about Damián Ferrari’s cold eyes, about Ricardo’s leering gaze, about the crushing weight of the huge, dark studio. Instead, she found herself giving them the edited, palatable version. She described the lights, the cameras, the dizzying scale of it all, omitting the parts that had made her feel small and afraid.

Then she placed the contract on the dining table. The thick sheaf of paper landed with a soft thud, and a reverent silence fell over the room. It was an artifact from that other world, a tangible piece of the dream. Marta picked it up as if it were a sacred text, her fingers tracing the embossed logo of the television network. “Dios mío, look at it, Leo. It’s so official.” She squinted at the first page. “It says here… exclusive representation for two years. Two years, Catita! That means they believe in you!” She saw only the opportunity, the vote of confidence. She didn’t see the chains hidden in the ink. Catalina tried to explain the producer’s words, the feeling of being assessed like a piece of livestock. “Mamá, he said I was… marketable. He wants to shape me. He mentioned a life of scrubbing floors.”

Her mother’s smile faltered for only a second. “He is a businessman, mija. That is how they talk. They see your value! He is telling you he can make you a success so you will never have to worry about scrubbing floors again. Is that not what we want?” To her mother, who had lived a life defined by pragmatism and sacrifice, Damián’s cruel words were just a simple statement of fact, a promise of escape. To argue against it felt like throwing their sacrifices back in their faces. Catalina fell silent, the unease curdling in her stomach as Leo picked up the contract, whistling softly at its thickness. “You’re gonna be rich, Catita,” he said, his eyes gleaming. They couldn’t see the cage for its golden bars.

Later, as the excitement simmered down and the plates were being cleared, Abuela Elena shuffled over to where Catalina stood by the window, the heavy contract still in her hands. The old woman didn’t speak, but simply placed her hand over Catalina’s on the document. Her touch was as dry and light as a leaf, but it felt anchoring. “They cannot move the earth you are planted in, little bird,” she said, her voice a low rasp. “They can build a new house around you, a beautiful palace. They can paint the windows with new scenery. But your roots, they are still in this ground. Your father’s ground. My ground. Do not forget the feel of the real earth beneath your feet.” She patted Catalina’s hand and shuffled back to her room, leaving her granddaughter with the weight of her simple, profound wisdom.

That night, sleep would not come. The leftover milanesa sat like a stone in her belly. In the quiet of her small room, she took the contract out again. The garment bag with the crimson dress hung on the back of her door like a ghost of a future she wasn’t sure she wanted. She scanned the dense pages of legalese, the words blurring together until a single phrase leaped out at her from a section titled “Creative and Image Control.” It granted the production company “sole and absolute discretion” over all aspects of her “artistic direction, song selection, public image, styling, and personal brand.” It was Damián’s threat codified, made legally binding. *Sole and absolute discretion.* They could take her grandfather’s zamba and turn it into a pop jingle. They could take her mother’s warnings and dress them up in a revealing costume. They could take her, Catita Morales, and erase her completely.

A tremor of pure, cold fear ran through her, different from the stage fright she’d felt earlier. This was a fear for her very self. She was out of her depth, a swimmer caught in a current she couldn’t see, being pulled out to a cold, dark sea. She thought of the faces from the studio. Damián, the architect of this contract. Ricardo, a willing product of the system. But then she remembered others. The brothers, Mateo and Javier, with their quiet solidarity. And Gustavo, the stage manager. *Don’t ever lose that, kid.* He had seen it. He had recognized the danger and had tried to warn her. He had called her ‘kid’, not ‘little bird’ or an ‘asset’. It was a small thing, but it felt significant. He was a person inside the machine.

Getting to her feet, Catalina walked back to the open window, leaving the contract on her bed like a venomous snake. The sounds of Buenos Aires were a familiar lullaby: the distant rumble of a bus, the passionate argument from an apartment across the way, the faint, melancholic notes of a tango drifting on the night air. These were the sounds that had shaped her voice. Abuela was right. This was her earth. Damián Ferrari could build his palace, but she would not forget the ground she was standing on. The initial joy of the phone call had been burned away, leaving behind something harder and more durable. A quiet resolve began to form in her heart. This was no longer just a singing competition. It was a fight for her soul. And she knew, with a sudden, startling clarity, that she could not fight it alone.The next morning, the sun rising over the city’s rooftops did not bring the same dread. It brought a cold, clear focus. Catalina woke not with anxiety, but with a plan taking shape in the quiet of her mind. The contract lay on her bedside table, and she looked at it now not as a source of fear, but as an enemy’s battle plan, something to be studied and countered. She would not be a lamb led to a gilded slaughterhouse. She would have to go back to the studio for more rehearsals, but she would go back as herself, armed with the knowledge of what they wanted to take from her. She would wear the crimson dress if she had to, but she would not let it wear her.

At the breakfast table, the mood was still buoyant. Marta was chattering about what she would wear to the live finale, sketching out designs on a napkin. Leo, forgoing his usual sullen silence, was calculating the odds of her winning based on viewer comments he’d read online. They were living in the bright, sunlit future the phone call had promised, completely unaware of the shadows Catalina had walked through yesterday. She tried to broach the subject of the contract again, to explain the clause about creative control, but her words were met with loving incomprehension. “Of course they control it, Catita,” Marta said, waving her hand dismissively. “They are the experts! They know how to make a star. You just have to sing. It’s the easiest part!” To them, her resistance was a form of self-sabotage, a fear of success she needed to overcome. Catalina saw the futility of it and retreated into a quiet watchfulness, eating her toast and preserving her strength for the battles she knew would have to be fought elsewhere.

The second trip to Martínez felt entirely different. The city passing by the tinted window was no longer a blur of possibility but a landscape she was fighting for. She carried her cloth tote bag, and inside, nestled between a water bottle and her sheet music, was the contract. It felt heavy and dangerous, a concealed weapon. When she walked through the studio's automatic doors, the chill in the air no longer seemed merely physical; it felt calculated, a climate designed to strip away warmth and humanity. She bypassed the harried assistants and walked with a new, determined stride, ignoring the curious glances. She was no longer a tourist in this place. She was an insurgent.

She found Mateo and Javier tuning their charangos in a small rehearsal lounge, the delicate, plinking notes a startlingly organic sound in the sterile environment. Ricardo was in a corner, taking selfies and practicing his smolder in the reflection of a vending machine. Catalina walked directly to the brothers, her heart beating a steady, resolute rhythm. They looked up, their expressions welcoming. Before she could lose her nerve, she spoke, her voice low. “Your contracts,” she said, without preamble. “Were they like this?” She pulled the document from her bag, the pages seeming to suck the light from the room.

Mateo’s warm expression tightened with a familiar weariness. He put down his instrument and took the pages, his eyes scanning the first few lines with an expert speed. “Sole and absolute discretion,” he read aloud, then grunted. “Sí, compañera. It is the same cage they build for everyone.” Javier nodded grimly. “They promise you wings but the contract is the fine print that says the sky belongs to them. We had a friend, a folklorist from Jujuy. A voice like an angel. He signed. A year later, he was singing reggaeton in a shopping mall, his eyes were dead. They owned his name, his voice, everything. He couldn't even busk on the street singing his own father’s songs without their permission.” The story landed with the force of a punch, validating every fear that had kept her awake.

“So what do you do?” Catalina asked, her voice barely a whisper. “You have to find a lawyer,” Mateo said, handing the contract back. “A real one. Not one from their list. Someone with teeth, who fights for the artist, not the industry. They are hard to find, and they cost money. But it is cheaper than the price of your soul.” Before she could ask more, Ricardo swaggered over, having overheard them. “Still taking advice from the museum pieces, Catita? A lawyer?” he scoffed. “The only thing you need to negotiate is your winner’s bonus. You play the game, or you go back to your dusty apartment. Don’t be a fool.” He winked at her, the gesture dripping with condescension, before a production assistant called his name and he sauntered off.

Just then, a man bustled into the room, clapping his hands together with an aggressive, manufactured energy. He was trim, dressed in expensive sneakers and a tight black t-shirt, his hair artfully messy. “People, people! Let’s make magic! I’m Esteban, your musical director for the finale.” His eyes scanned the room and landed on Catalina. “Ah! The diamond in the rough! Catalina, a pleasure. Your voice, my God! Such raw power.” He beamed at her, but his smile was all teeth. “Now, that zamba was adorable for the audition, a perfect little taste of the pampas. But for the finale, we need an explosion. We need a moment.” He snapped his fingers and an assistant scurried forward, handing Catalina a new set of sheet music. She looked down at the title. It was a soaring, generic power ballad, the kind of song that was scientifically engineered to produce tears and phone-in votes, with lyrics about shining stars and broken wings that had no connection to anything real.

This was it. The first test. The first move in the game. She could feel the stares of everyone in the room. Mateo and Javier watched her with quiet, tense solidarity. Esteban tapped his foot, expecting immediate, grateful compliance. She took a deep breath, the cold studio air a shock to her system. She thought of her abuela’s words, of her father’s guitar, of the defiant sorrow of a bandoneon in the night. She looked up from the soulless sheet music and met Esteban’s impatient gaze. Her voice, when it came, was steady and clear. “Thank you, Señor Esteban. It’s a very… loud song. But I will be singing my grandfather’s zamba for the finale. It is the song that brought me here.”

A stunned silence descended on the small rehearsal room. Esteban’s smile didn’t so much fall as it was wiped clean, replaced by a mask of cold disbelief. No one had ever said no to him. He was the hitmaker, the star-shaper. His authority was absolute. He took a step closer to her, his voice dropping to a low, menacing hiss that was meant for her alone. “Let me be clear. This isn’t a request. Damián Ferrari himself has signed off on this new direction. He feels, and I agree, that your choice is too… niche. Too sad. The finale is a celebration. You will sing the song you have been given, or we will find another finalist who is more of a team player. Do you understand me?” The threat was unveiled, stripped of all pretense. Submit or be erased. The crimson dress, the marketable authenticity, the golden cage—it all led to this moment, this choice between obedience and oblivion.### Chapter 3

Catalina’s heart thrummed, a frantic bird against her ribs, but her gaze did not waver from Esteban’s. The silence in the room stretched thin, threatening to snap. Every person present had become a statue in a tableau of defiance. Mateo had frozen with his hand hovering over his charango strings. Ricardo watched from his corner with a look of sheer, gleeful disbelief, as if he were witnessing a spectacular car crash in slow motion. The moment belonged to Catalina and the furious man in front of her, a pocket of stillness in the studio's ceaseless hum.

“I understand you perfectly,” Catalina said, her voice quiet but carrying the weight of stone. “And I am telling you, with all due respect, that I will not sing that song. My voice is not for sale.”

Esteban’s face, a carefully constructed mask of casual cool, finally cracked. A dark flush crept up his neck, and his eyes narrowed into venomous slits. “Not for sale? Not for sale? Little girl, you are standing in a temple built on things that are for sale! Your dress, the lights, the cameras, my time! This entire competition is a transaction! You are a product, and if the product is defective or disobedient, we replace it. Gustavo!” he barked, turning toward the sound booth. “Get Damián on the phone. The little folklorist has decided to end her career before it begins.”

Ricardo let out a low whistle. “Told you not to be a fool,” he murmured, loud enough for Catalina to hear. The words were meant to sting, but she barely registered them. A strange calm had settled over her, the placid eye of the hurricane she had created. She had said her truth. If this was the consequence, then so be it. She would go back to Almagro with her head held high, back to the smell of garlic and the real earth beneath her feet.

But before Esteban’s command could be fully carried out, a solid, weary presence appeared at Catalina’s side. It was Gustavo, the stage manager, his headset now dangling around his neck. He placed a steadying hand on Esteban’s arm, his expression one of profound exhaustion, as if he had navigated this same pointless conflict a thousand times before. “Esteban, come on. We’re on a schedule. Let’s not blow up the whole day. Damián is in a meeting with the sponsors. Let the kid run her song. We can sort the playlist later.” He turned to Catalina, his kind eyes sending a clear, urgent message. *Take the lifeline.* “Go on, Catalina,” he said, his voice gruff. “Give us the zamba. Let’s hear what all the fuss is about.”

Esteban looked ready to explode, but something in Gustavo’s demeanor, the sheer force of his weariness, seemed to deflate him. He snatched the power ballad sheet music from Catalina’s hand as if it were contaminated. “Fine,” he spat. “Waste our time. Sing your sad little song for the ghosts. But this conversation is not over. You have until tomorrow morning to come to your senses.” He stormed out of the rehearsal lounge, his expensive sneakers squeaking in fury on the polished floor.

The tension in the room broke, and everyone exhaled at once. Mateo and Javier gave Catalina a look of profound, worried respect. She had faced down the beast and, for now, had not been devoured. Gustavo gave her a small, almost imperceptible nod before turning to the other crew members. “Alright, people, let’s get back to it. We’re losing the light.” As the room stirred back to life, he paused beside her and spoke in a low, conspiratorial voice, barely moving his lips. “They’re not bluffing, kid. They will replace you. You need a shark, and you need one yesterday.” He slipped a crumpled bar napkin into her hand. “His name is Ismael Rojas. He’s an old dinosaur, but he’s got teeth. Go now. Use the back exit. Tell him Gustavo sent you.” He was gone before she could even say thank you, swallowed back into the machinery of the studio.

Catalina looked at the napkin. A name, an address in Monserrat, and a phone number were scribbled in hurried blue ink. A shark. A dinosaur with teeth. It was the slenderest of hopes, but it was more than she’d had a minute ago. With a grateful nod to the brothers, she gathered her things, clutching the napkin in her fist. She followed Gustavo’s instructions, slipping out a side door and into the jarring sunlight, leaving the crimson dress and the soulless power ballad behind her in the refrigerated darkness.

The taxi ride to Monserrat was a journey back in time. The sleek, modern architecture of the suburbs gave way to the grand, crumbling facades of old Buenos Aires. The office of Ismael Rojas was not in a gleaming tower but on the second floor of a magnificent old building with a wrought-iron elevator that shuddered its way upward with a groan of protest. The air on the landing was cool and smelled of floor wax and history. His door was heavy oak, with a brass plate that read simply: “Dr. I. Rojas - Abogado.”

She knocked, and a gruff voice from within yelled, “¡Pase!” She pushed the door open into a room that looked more like a professor’s library than a lawyer’s office. Walls were lined floor-to-ceiling with overflowing bookshelves. Stacks of yellowed papers and legal tomes formed precarious towers on every available surface. Through a haze of cigarette smoke, she saw a man sitting behind a massive, cluttered desk. He was older, perhaps seventy, with a magnificent mane of white hair, a face like a topographical map of Argentina, and eyes that were astonishingly sharp and intelligent behind a pair of smudged reading glasses. He was nursing a small cup of coffee and scowling at a document.

“¿Sí?” he barked, not looking up.

“Dr. Rojas? My name is Catalina Morales. Gustavo sent me.”

At the name Gustavo, the lawyer’s head snapped up. He studied her for a long moment, his gaze taking in her simple dress, her earnest face, the contract clutched in her hand. A flicker of something—recognition, or perhaps just weary resignation—crossed his features. He gestured with his cigarette toward a worn leather chair that faced his desk. “Another lamb for the slaughter, eh? Sit. And for God’s sake, close the door. You’re letting the century escape.”

Catalina sat, her heart pounding. She explained her story in a rush—the phone call, Damián Ferrari, the contract, the standoff with Esteban over the song. Rojas listened patiently, taking slow, deliberate sips of his coffee, his sharp eyes never leaving her face. When she finished, she slid the contract across the desk. He didn't even open it. He just tapped the thick cover with a nicotine-stained finger.

“Telecentro standard finalist contract. Paragraph 4b grants them sole and absolute creative control. Paragraph 7c gives them indefinite rights to your name and likeness for promotional purposes. Paragraph 12a contains a non-compete clause so restrictive you couldn’t legally sing in the shower for another network,” he recited from memory, his voice a gravelly drone. “It is a beautifully written piece of slavery. You cannot fight it in court. They have more lawyers on retainer than I have books, and I have many, many books. To fight this contract is to lose.”

A wave of despair washed over Catalina. This was it, then. Her only hope was telling her it was hopeless. “So… so there is nothing I can do?”

Rojas finally allowed a small, grim smile to touch his lips. He leaned back in his creaking chair, creating a small cloud of smoke that haloed his white hair. “I said you cannot fight the *contract*. I did not say you cannot fight *them*.” He leaned forward again, the smile gone, his eyes gleaming with a strategist’s fire. “Damián Ferrari is not a stupid man, but he is an arrogant one. His currency is not justice; it is image. Perception. He is selling a story, your story. The humble girl with the voice of an angel who gets a shot at the big time. It is a fairy tale. And in a fairy tale, the princess cannot be devoured by the corporate dragon. It makes for bad television.”

He stood and began to pace the narrow space between the desk and the bookshelves. “He wants your authenticity, but he wants to control it, to sanitize it, to turn it into a product. What we must do is make your authenticity too powerful, too public for him to dare touch. You will not fight them in a courtroom, Señorita Morales. You will fight them on the stage, in the newspapers, on the radio. You wanted to sing your grandfather’s song? Good. Now, that song is no longer just a song. It is a flag. It is a symbol of your entire story. We will make it so that if they take that song away from you, they are not just changing a playlist. They are robbing your dead grandfather. They are silencing the voice of the people. They are crushing the very dream they claim to be selling.”

Catalina stared at him, mesmerized. He was not a shark. He was a lion, old and scarred, but still the king of his domain. He was talking about turning her small, private battle into a public crusade. The thought was terrifying, but it was also electrifying.

“How?” she breathed.

“Gustavo did his part. He got you to me. Now I do mine.” He picked up his ancient, ringing telephone. “I have a friend, a journalist at *Clarín*. A real one, not a gossip columnist. He loves a good David and Goliath story. Especially when Goliath is a prick like Damián Ferrari.” Rojas winked at her as he began to dial. “You, Señorita, are going to give your first interview. And you are going to tell them everything.”Catalina felt the weight of his final words settle over her. Give her first interview. Tell them everything. The idea was paralyzing. She was a private person, her feelings a walled garden she rarely let others into. To expose her family, her fears, her grandfather’s memory to the cold appraisal of the public felt like a profound violation. But as she looked at Ismael Rojas, who was now searching through a Rolodex that looked as ancient as he was, she understood. This was the price. The only way to protect the quiet, sacred thing inside her was to shout its name from the rooftops.

“He will try to intimidate you,” Rojas said, not looking up from his search, as if continuing a conversation that had been happening for years. “Ferrari. He will call you. He will sound reasonable. He will talk about your family, about the money, about the incredible opportunity you are throwing away. He will make you feel ungrateful, foolish. He will try to isolate you from me, from anyone who supports you. He will tell you I am a bitter old man who doesn’t understand the modern world. He may not be wrong about that,” he added with a dry chuckle, finally pulling out a worn card. “But I understand him. That is more important.”

He dialed the number on the rotary phone with practiced, deliberate movements. Catalina watched the dial whir back into place after each digit, the sound an echo from her own apartment, from the moment this all began. That phone call had felt like the beginning of a dream. This one felt like the beginning of a war.

“Agustín, Ismael,” Rojas barked into the receiver. A pause. “Of course I’m still alive, you ghoul, I’m just waiting for you to go first so I can write a suitably scathing obituary… Listen, I have something for you. A real story, not the press releases you’ve been rewriting. Remember how you said you wanted a story with a heart? Well, I’ve got the heart of Buenos Aires sitting in my office right now, and the vampires at Telecentro are trying to suck it dry.” He listened for a moment, a rare, genuine smile touching his lips. He covered the receiver with his palm and looked at Catalina. “He asks if you can sing.” Rojas turned back to the phone. “Like an angel who has seen the inside of hell and come back to tell the tale. She’s one of the finalists on ‘Corazón de la Canción’… Yes, that garbage. The network is trying to force her to abandon her music, the music of her family, in favor of some factory-produced filth. It’s the oldest story in the book, and it’s happening right now. She’s here. You can have the exclusive.”

He named a classic corner cafe in San Telmo, near the Plaza Dorrego. The meeting was set for an hour. After he hung up, Rojas stubbed out his cigarette in an overflowing ashtray. “Agustín is a good man. He is cynical, as all good journalists must be, but he has a conscience. Be honest with him. Do not be dramatic. Do not cry. Just tell him your truth. Talk about your father. Talk about your abuela. Talk about the song. Make him understand that this is not about a performance. It is about heritage.”

He walked her to the door, placing a firm, fatherly hand on her shoulder. “Go now. And Catalina,” he said, his sharp eyes softening for just a moment, “do not be afraid. Fear is their best weapon. When you show them you are not afraid to lose, they lose their power over you. Because then, you have nothing left to lose, and everything to fight for.”

Walking through the grand, echoing hallways of the old building, Catalina felt as though she had passed through a portal. She had entered Rojas’s office a frightened girl with a problem; she was leaving a woman with a strategy. The fear was still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it was now overlaid with something else: a fierce, burning purpose. Rojas hadn’t just given her a plan; he had given her back the sense of power she’d felt on the soundstage, but this time it was not just an artistic power. It was the power of conviction.

The cafe in San Telmo was exactly the kind of place her father would have loved. Dark wood, checkered floors, old black-and-white photos of tango singers on the walls, the air thick with the scent of strong coffee and medialunas. A man sitting alone at a small table near the window looked up as she entered. He was younger than Rojas, maybe in his late forties, with a rumpled linen jacket, tired eyes, and an expression of patient skepticism. He saw her hesitate and gave a slight, encouraging nod. It had to be Agustín.

She sat down, and he introduced himself, his voice much gentler than his world-weary face suggested. He ordered her a cortado without asking, a gesture of easy familiarity that put her slightly at ease. He didn’t pull out a notepad or a recorder. Instead, he simply leaned forward. “So,” Agustín said. “Ismael says you have a story for me.”

And Catalina, remembering the lawyer’s advice, began to talk. She didn't talk about contracts or clauses. She talked about the weight of the silence in her apartment, and the way the rotary phone seemed to mock her. She described her mother’s hands, chapped from work but always gentle, and her abuela’s belief that her grandfather’s soul was a cathedral. She spoke of her father, of his unfulfilled dreams and the cheap guitar he played with the grace of a master. And she spoke of the zamba, not as a piece of music, but as a thread connecting her to all of them, a piece of the earth she carried inside her. As she spoke, the cafe seemed to fade away. She was no longer performing for a journalist; she was simply bearing witness to her own life, to the small, fierce love that bound her family together in their tiny apartment in Almagro. She was giving him her truth, unadorned and honest.

Agustín listened, his skeptical expression slowly dissolving, replaced by a deep, focused attention. He was no longer a journalist hunting for a scoop; he was a man hearing a story that resonated with something deep inside him, a story about the soul of his city, a city that was constantly at risk of paving over its own heart in the name of progress. When she finally fell silent, her coffee untouched and cold, he was quiet for a long time. Then he finally pulled out a small, battered notepad. “Felicitaciones, Señorita Morales,” he said, his voice husky with an emotion he tried to hide. “You are one of our three finalists.” He had started his story.### Chapter 4

The next morning, the silence in the apartment was different. It was not the heavy, waiting silence of before, but a thin, brittle quiet filled with unspoken anxiety. Catalina had been awake since before dawn, watching the grey light seep into the sky, feeling as if she were standing on a cliff’s edge, waiting for the ground to give way. The thud of the morning papers landing on the kiosk at the corner of the street was as loud as a gunshot in her ears. It took all her courage to slip on her shoes, murmur a word to her mother who was already nursing a coffee at the kitchen table with worried eyes, and go down to the street. She bought a copy of *Clarín*, the pages feeling slick and foreign in her hands. She didn't dare open it on the street, under the curious gaze of Señor Rodriguez who was, as always, walking his terrier.

Back in the apartment, she spread the paper on the small dining table, its black and white expanse seeming to dominate the room. And there it was, on the front page of the culture section. It was not a small column. It was a feature, complete with a candid photograph Agustín must have taken of her in the cafe, her face earnest and unguarded. The headline was a masterpiece of journalistic provocation: “A ZAMBA FOR A SOUL: The Finalist on ‘Corazón de la Canción’ Who Refuses to Sell Her Grandfather’s Ghost.” The story itself was everything she had told Agustín, woven together with a sharp, incisive commentary on the music industry. He quoted her directly about her abuela’s words, her father's guitar, the earth of her barrio. He contrasted this with the cold, boilerplate language of entertainment contracts, painting a vivid picture of a young artist fighting for her identity against a corporate behemoth. He never named Damián Ferrari, but referred to him only as “the network executive,” a faceless symbol of cynical commerce.

Marta came to look over her shoulder, her breath catching in a horrified gasp. "¡Ay, Dios! Catalina, what is this?” Her initial excitement at seeing her daughter’s picture in the paper curdled into stark terror as she read the words. “You told this man about us? About Papá? You put our whole life in the newspaper for everyone to see? They will destroy you, Catita! They will sue us! We will lose the apartment! You have thrown everything away!” Her voice rose with each frantic sentence, her hands fluttering in distress. The article was not a story of courage to her; it was a public confession of disobedience, a foolish and dangerous act of defiance against powerful people.

“She did what she had to do, Marta,” a raspy voice said from the doorway. Abuela Elena stood there, fully dressed, her back straighter than usual. She had already read her own copy of the paper, which Leo, who had dashed out earlier, was now holding with a look of awe. “This isn’t a fight she started,” Elena continued, walking slowly to the table and placing her hand on the newspaper. “When a wolf has you by the throat, you do not worry about being polite. You bite back with any teeth you have.” Leo nodded in vigorous agreement. “This is epic, Catita! It’s all over the internet. Everyone is on your side! They’re calling you ‘The Voice of Almagro’!” For him, it was a thrilling drama, a real-life video game where his sister was the hero.

The phone rang. The sound sliced through the tense family debate, instantly silencing everyone. It was not the gentle *brrr-ing* from before, but a sharp, insistent, modern trill. They all stared at it. This was not the call of a stranger. This was the enemy at the gates. Catalina took a deep, steadying breath, remembering Rojas’s warning, and walked over to the phone. She picked up the receiver. “Hola?”

“Catalina. Damián Ferrari.” His voice was unnervingly calm, smooth as silk, but with a frigid undercurrent that made the hairs on her arms stand up. “I’m calling because I’ve just read a very… creative piece of fiction in this morning’s paper. I must say, you have a talent for storytelling, both in song and, it seems, in print. I’m very disappointed. I thought we had an understanding.”

“There was no misunderstanding, Señor Ferrari,” Catalina said, her voice shaking only slightly. She could feel her family’s eyes on her, their collective breath held. “I just want to sing my song.”

“Of course. And we want you to sing, too,” he said, his tone dripping with false reason. “That’s why we chose you. But a finale is a collaborative effort. It’s a show. What you have done is unprofessional. It has made my partners… nervous. They see you as a risk.” He paused, letting the weight of the word hang in the air. “But I believe in you, Catalina. I see your potential. So I am going to make you an offer, against my better judgment. Forget this foolishness. Issue a public statement saying your words were taken out of context, that you are thrilled with the network’s creative direction. Sing the ballad we chose for you. And I will make sure this all goes away. I will personally double the winner’s prize money for you, whether you win or lose. Think of what that money could do for your family. A new apartment. No more scrubbing floors for your mother. A future for your brother.”

It was exactly as Rojas had predicted. He was dangling the gilded cage in front of her again, this time with the door wide open, lined with cash. The temptation was a physical thing, a sickening lurch in her gut. She thought of her mother’s tired face, of the stack of unpaid bills on the mantelpiece. He was offering her everything they had ever dreamed of. All she had to do was surrender a small piece of her soul. She looked at her abuela, who gave her a slow, almost imperceptible shake of the head. She looked at the newspaper on the table, at the headline that had given her a voice.

“My soul is not for sale, Señor Ferrari,” she said, the words coming out stronger and clearer than she thought possible. “And neither is my grandfather’s.”

There was a long, cold silence on the other end of the line. When Damián spoke again, all traces of warmth and reason were gone. His voice was flat and hard as ice. “I see. You have made your choice. You have chosen to be a martyr instead of a star. A very foolish choice. The stage is a very lonely place, Señorita Morales. We’ll see how your ‘truth’ sounds without our lights, without our cameras, without our sound. We’ll see how the Voice of Almagro sounds when no one can hear her.” The line went dead with a sharp click.

Catalina slowly placed the receiver back in its cradle. The silence that rushed back in was profound. She had done it. She had declared war on the most powerful man in her new world. The elation of her defiance was quickly replaced by a wave of cold dread. She looked at her mother, whose face was pale with fear. She looked at Leo, whose triumphant expression had been replaced by one of confusion and concern. The battle was no longer an abstract thing in a newspaper. It was here, in their living room, and the consequences were no longer theoretical. They were coming for her.The moment the receiver clicked into its cradle, the apartment felt like a vacuum, all the air and noise sucked out by the finality of Damián Ferrari’s threat. Marta was the first to break, her hands flying to her mouth, a muffled sob escaping. “He will ruin us,” she whispered, her eyes wide with a terror that Catalina had not seen since the day of her father’s accident. “Catita, what have you done? You had everything, a new life for us, and you threw it away for a song!” Her anguish was a raw, open wound in the middle of the room. She wasn't angry; she was terrified for her daughter, for their precarious existence that now seemed to be hanging by the thinnest of threads.

Catalina’s own courage wavered under the force of her mother’s fear. Doubt, cold and sharp, pierced her resolve. Had she been selfish? Had she sacrificed her family’s future for her own pride? She looked from her mother’s stricken face to Leo, who had lost his triumphant glow and now looked simply young and scared. It was Abuela Elena who moved first. She shuffled over to Marta and placed a frail hand on her shaking arm. “He offered her a palace, Marta, but he wanted to own the deed to her soul. Your husband, my son, he would have starved before he made a trade like that. He would be prouder of her today than if she had come home with a million pesos.” She turned her dark, clear eyes to Catalina. “You did not throw anything away, mija. You chose to keep the only thing that is truly yours.”

Just then, the phone rang again. A collective flinch went through the room. Catalina stared at it, her stomach twisting into a knot. Had Ferrari called back to deliver another blow? With her grandmother’s words echoing in her ears, she reached for it, her hand surprisingly steady. It was Rojas. His voice was a gravelly rumble, devoid of pleasantries. “He called you.” It wasn’t a question.

“Yes,” Catalina confirmed. “He offered me money. He threatened me.”

“Good,” Rojas grunted, a sound that in anyone else would have been alarming. “It means he’s angry. And when a man like Ferrari is angry, he makes mistakes. When he is afraid of public perception, he overcorrects. Listen to me very carefully. The finale is tomorrow night. They will not disqualify you. That would make the story bigger, it would prove Agustín’s article right. Ferrari is too vain for that. No, he will try to make you fail publicly. He will try to humiliate you on that stage.”

Catalina’s blood ran cold. “How?”

“Sabotage,” Rojas said bluntly. “Technical. Psychological. They will try to get inside your head. Bad sound in your monitor so you can’t hear yourself sing. A camera angle that makes you look small and frightened. A lighting cue that goes wrong. They will try to make it look like you cracked under the pressure. You must be prepared. Do not react. Do not show them that it is working. You must be a rock, Catalina. You must go out on that stage and sing your truth, even if the only person in the world who can hear it properly is you.”

The final day arrived under a sky the color of slate. The black sedan came for her as promised, an ominous chariot for her public execution. The ride to Martínez was a silent torment. Every traffic light, every passing car, felt like a component in a vast machine grinding inexorably toward her humiliation. When she arrived at Telecentro, the atmosphere had shifted from the chilly professionalism of before to something overtly hostile. The production assistants who had previously offered her water and nervous smiles now avoided her gaze, scurrying past as if her defiance were contagious. She was an outcast, a marked woman.

In the communal dressing room, Ricardo was preening in front of a mirror, a triumphant smirk playing on his lips. “Big day, little bird,” he said, catching her eye in the reflection. “The whole country is watching. Hope you don’t get stage fright.” His words were laced with poison. Mateo and Javier sat in a quiet corner, their faces grim. As Catalina passed, Mateo reached out and briefly touched her arm, a small, silent gesture of solidarity that meant the world.

The final sound check was a masterclass in psychological warfare. Esteban, the musical director, greeted her with a smile that was all ice and teeth. “Let’s hear the people’s anthem one last time,” he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Catalina walked to the center mark on the vast, empty stage. The familiar cavern of technology now felt like a gladiatorial arena. She took a breath, closed her eyes, and began to sing the opening lines of the zamba.

Immediately, something was wrong. In her in-ear monitor, her voice was a distorted, distant echo, drowned out by a deafening hiss of static. She faltered, her pitch wavering. She couldn’t hear herself, couldn’t find her center. A cold panic began to creep up her throat. From the sound booth, Esteban’s voice crackled over the speakers, feigning concern. “Having some trouble there, Catalina? Nerves getting to you?” The crew members exchanged knowing glances. This was it. This was the sabotage Rojas had warned her about. They were making her deaf to her own music.

She tried again, pushing her voice harder, trying to hear it through the bones in her head, but the static in her ear was a roaring monster, devouring her song. Tears of frustration pricked her eyes. She felt a hand on her shoulder and looked up to see Gustavo, his face a mask of professional impassivity. “The frequency is getting interference from somewhere,” he said loudly for the benefit of anyone listening. He fiddled with the battery pack on her belt, his back to the sound booth. For a blessed second, the static vanished, and her pure voice flooded her ear. It was beautiful. It was true. Then he seemed to fumble, and the static returned, even louder than before. But in that brief moment, he had looked her directly in the eye and mouthed two words: *Trust it.*

Then he was gone, called away by an urgent crackle on his radio. Catalina stood alone in the center of the stage, the static screaming in her ear. She took a shaky breath. *Trust it.* Don’t trust what you hear. Trust what you feel. Trust the song as it lived in her body, in her bones, in her blood. She opened her mouth one last time. She closed her eyes, shut out the hostile static, and sang not to the monitor in her ear, but to the memory of her father’s voice, to the cathedral of her grandfather’s soul. She sang from a place deeper than sound. Out in the empty auditorium, her voice, unheard by her, soared, pure and unbroken. Mateo and Javier were on their feet, their faces alight. Even Ricardo’s smirk had faded, replaced by a look of stunned disbelief. She had found a way to fight back. She had found her weapon.The hours before the live show were a disorienting fever dream. The backstage area of Telecentro was a hive of frantic, high-strung energy, smelling of burnt hair, sweat, and aerosol spray. Harried figures with headsets rushed past, speaking a coded language of cues and camera angles. In the midst of this chaos, Catalina was an island of unnerving calm. She sat before a brightly lit mirror in the communal dressing room, allowing a makeup artist to paint a face on her that felt like a stranger’s. She was wearing the crimson dress. It felt less like a costume now and more like armor, the uniform of a soldier heading into a battle she did not choose but was determined to win. Ricardo was holding court in his corner, boasting loudly about his post-show plans, while Mateo and Javier quietly tuned their instruments, the organic, woody sound a small act of rebellion in the synthetic environment. They met her eyes in the mirror and gave her a look of deep, unspoken encouragement. In this polished labyrinth, she was not entirely alone.

Her family was escorted in a few minutes before airtime. Marta, dressed in a new floral dress she had sewn herself, immediately began fussing with a stray curl on Catalina’s forehead, her hands trembling with a love so fierce it was almost painful. “You are so beautiful, mi amor,” she whispered, her eyes shining with a mixture of terror and immense pride. Leo, looking awkward and out of place in a collared shirt, just stared, his face a canvas of awe at the sheer scale of the spectacle. But it was Abuela Elena who anchored her. The old woman, seeming to draw strength from the bright lights and chaos, took Catalina’s face in her papery hands, her grip surprisingly firm. She did not wish her luck. She simply said, “Tonight, you sing for your father. Let him hear you.” The words went straight to the core of Catalina, a final, perfect tuning of her soul before the performance.

The show began with a blast of synthetic music and a dizzying light display. The host, a man with a blinding white smile and a voice like polished glass, bounded onto the stage and whipped the studio audience into a frenzy. Ricardo went first, delivering his ballad with flawless, soulless precision. He hit every note, milked every dramatic pause, and ended with a smoldering look directly into the camera. The applause was loud and polite. The brothers from Salta followed, their harmonies tight and their passion evident, their performance an authentic and beautiful piece of folk art that felt almost too delicate for the room. Then it was her turn.

“And now,” the host announced, his tone shifting to one of subtle condescension, “our final contestant. You’ve read about her in the papers. She’s got the whole city talking! With a song from another time, here is the voice of Almagro, Catalina Morales!”

Walking from the wings to the center mark felt like wading through deep water. The roar of the audience, the heat of the lights, the sheer number of staring eyes—it was a physical pressure threatening to crush her. She found her spot, her crimson dress a lone drop of blood on the vast, dark stage. In the shadows to her left, she saw Gustavo. He didn’t smile. He just gave a single, sharp nod, a general’s salute before a charge. The opening chords from the house band began, and she took a breath.

The sabotage was immediate and vicious. The static that screamed into her in-ear monitor was a physical assault, a wall of white noise designed to deafen her to herself. At the same moment, the main spotlight that was meant to illuminate her face failed to come up, leaving her in a murky half-light for the crucial opening bars. She could feel the collective gasp of the audience, could sense the confusion. The giant video screen behind her, which was supposed to be showing a soft-focus image of a jacaranda tree, flickered and glitched, showing a jarring snippet of a commercial for a moment before going black. In a darkened control room high above the stage, Damián Ferrari leaned forward, a grim, satisfied smile on his face, waiting for the girl to break. He had given her every chance. Now, he would watch her be erased.

A wave of pure terror, cold and sharp, washed over Catalina. It was all happening exactly as Rojas had said. They were trying to make her fail. Her voice faltered on the second line, a slight, almost imperceptible waver, but to her, it felt like a catastrophic collapse. The static roared. The darkness pressed in. She wanted to run, to simply walk off the stage and disappear back into the anonymity of her life. But then two things happened. She saw her mother’s face in the crowd, pale with fear, and she remembered Gustavo’s words, mouthed in the empty theater: *Trust it.*

She closed her eyes. It was an act of surrender, but also of profound defiance. If they would not let her see, she would not look. If they would not let her hear, she would not listen. She shut out the hostile stage, the glitched screen, the screaming static. She willed herself away from Martínez and back home, to the third-floor apartment in Almagro. The roar in her ear became the sound of the evening traffic. The heat of the lights became the thick August humidity seeping through the window frames. The thousands of strangers dissolved, replaced by three faces: her mother’s, her brother’s, her abuela’s. She was not on a stage. She was in her living room, and she was singing for her father.

The zamba came out not as a performance, but as a testimony. Freed from the need to hear herself, her voice found its own, perfect center, guided by a lifetime of practice and an unbreakable connection to the music. It was a sound that was achingly human, full of sorrow and strength, a living thing in the sterile, technological cathedral. It filled the cavernous space, not with volume, but with a presence that was absolute. It spoke of the cracked pavement of her city, of the silent grief of faded photographs, of the defiant hope that bloomed in the face of disappointment. It was her truth, raw and unadorned, and it was undeniable.

In the control room, Damián Ferrari watched, his smile gone, his knuckles white where he gripped the console. The technical sabotage hadn't made her look weak; it had backfired spectacularly. The missed cues and distorted sound made her a solitary, heroic figure, battling against unseen forces, her voice the only pure thing in a compromised world. The audience was utterly transfixed, leaning forward as one body. The judges sat like statues, their professional veneers stripped away, their faces masks of stunned, genuine emotion. The cynical machinery of television had ground to a halt, silenced by a single, honest voice.

The last, mournful note of the zamba hung in the vast, silent hall, a thread of sound so delicate it seemed to hold the entire world in its vibration. Then it faded. The silence that followed was absolute, more profound and powerful than any applause. It stretched for one second, then two, then three. In that endless moment, Catalina opened her eyes, her heart hammering not with fear, but with a strange, dizzying peace. She had done it. She had survived. And then, from the back of the auditorium, a single man stood up and began to clap. A woman near the front joined him. Then, in a rushing, explosive wave, the entire theater was on its feet. It was not polite applause. It was a roar, a cathartic, thunderous ovation that shook the very foundations of the building. It was the sound of a thousand hearts breaking open at once. Through the shimmering lights and the tears welling in her own eyes, Catalina saw her family. Leo was on his chair, screaming himself hoarse. Marta was weeping without restraint, her face a beautiful ruin of joy and pride. And Abuela Elena, her face a cracked and beautiful landscape, simply met her granddaughter’s gaze and nodded, a slow, serene affirmation that said everything. The Voice of Almagro had been heard.### Chapter 5

The roar of the crowd was a physical force, a tidal wave of sound that seemed to lift Catalina from the floor. She stood blinking in the sudden, brilliant glare of the restored spotlights, the crimson dress a beacon in the storm of applause. The host, a man whose polished composure was his greatest professional asset, was visibly flustered. He stood frozen for a beat too long, his teleprompter forgotten, his manufactured smile replaced by a look of genuine astonishment. He had been prepared for a car crash, for a quiet, awkward failure. He had not been prepared for a resurrection.

He finally regained his footing, stepping toward Catalina as the ovation began to slowly recede. “Well,” he said, his voice straining to reclaim its usual buoyant tone, “it seems… it seems Catalina Morales has left us all speechless.” The camera panned to the judges’ table. The three industry veterans, who had started the night with sharp, almost bored critiques, were a study in disarray. The female pop star was dabbing at her eyes with a tissue, her mascara smudged. The stern record producer was staring at Catalina, shaking his head slowly in what looked like grudging reverence. It was the oldest judge, a legendary tango composer, who spoke first, waving away the host’s attempt to prompt him. He leaned into his microphone, his voice raspy with emotion.

“What we saw tonight was not a performance,” he began, the room falling silent to catch his words. “A performance can be practiced. It can be faked. What we saw was a testimony. In a world of noise, you gave us a moment of truth, Señorita. You did not just sing a song; you reminded us what music is for. It is not for selling records or winning prizes. It is to carry the souls of the people who came before us. Your grandfather would be very proud.” He did not offer a technical critique; he offered a blessing. The other two judges followed suit, their praise echoing his, speaking of courage and authenticity, their words inadvertently validating every line of Agustín’s article and turning the network’s attempted sabotage into an act of villainy that had been heroically overcome. Each word of praise was another nail in Damián Ferrari’s public coffin.

High above the stage, in the darkened control room, Damián watched the judges’ faces on his wall of monitors. The fury he had felt had evaporated, replaced by the cold, clear logic of a master strategist recognizing a dramatic and irreversible shift on the battlefield. His plan had not just failed; it had inverted, creating a narrative far more powerful than the one he had intended. He had tried to make her a pathetic martyr, but the audience had crowned her a saint. A saint, he mused with a flicker of grim admiration, was infinitely more valuable. He had lost control of the story for a moment, but he was a genius at seizing a new one. He picked up his private line and dialed. “It’s me,” he said to his head of marketing. “Kill the Ricardo campaign. All of it. Re-cut the promo package. The new tag is: ‘We don’t make stars. We find them.’ I want images of her, looking lost in the spotlight. The headline is ‘The Voice They Couldn’t Silence.’ Get it ready for the morning shows. We’re not the villains of this story. We’re the heroes who gave her the stage to fight on.” He had lost the battle, but in that moment, he plotted a way to win the war, not by breaking her, but by absorbing her, by becoming the benevolent patron of the very rebellion he had tried to crush.

The show cut to its final commercial break before the voting results were announced. The instant the cameras’ red lights went off, the stage was flooded with activity. Gustavo was the first to reach Catalina, his professional mask gone, replaced by a wide, relieved grin. He didn't speak, but simply took her by the shoulders and gave her a firm, proud shake before steering her offstage, away from the prying eyes and into the comparative quiet of the wings. The atmosphere backstage was electric. The brothers from Salta rushed to her, their faces alight with pure joy. “Compañera,” Mateo said, his voice thick with emotion as he wrapped her in a brief, heartfelt hug. “Tonight, you did not just sing for your family. You sang for all of our families. You sang for the real Argentina.”

Ricardo stood apart, his face a thunderous mask of rage and disbelief. He had been perfect, flawless. He had played the game exactly as he was supposed to, and this girl, this amateur from a dusty apartment, had broken all the rules and stolen his crown. He saw Catalina and took a step toward her, his fists clenched, but a sharp look from Gustavo stopped him cold. He turned and slammed his fist into a rack of costumes, letting out a guttural sound of frustration before storming off toward his dressing room. His defeat was as total as Catalina’s victory was absolute.

The three finalists were called back to the stage. They stood in a line under the hot lights, the host between them, a golden envelope in his hand. The manufactured tension was back, but this time it felt different, almost ceremonial. Catalina felt strangely distant from it all, as if she were watching herself on a television screen. Her heart was calm. She had already won the only thing that mattered. The prize money, the contract—they were secondary now. She had kept her soul. She found her family in the audience. Her mother was holding her abuela’s hand, both of them staring at her, their faces radiant. Leo was standing, vibrating with an energy that could have powered the entire studio. She gave them a small, tremulous smile.

“The public vote has been tallied,” the host announced, his voice booming across the nation. “The response has been overwhelming, the biggest in the history of ‘Corazón de la Canción’. The winner, taking home the grand prize and the recording contract is…” He paused, milking the moment for all it was worth, though everyone in the room, everyone in the country, already knew. “…Catalina Morales!”

The explosion of sound was deafening. Confetti cannons erupted, showering the stage in a glittering rain of gold and silver. The house band launched into a triumphant crescendo. For a moment, Catalina was frozen, a deer in the headlights of a victory she had never truly allowed herself to imagine. Mateo and Javier were the first to react, embracing her, their joy for her completely genuine. Then her family was there, somehow getting past security, and she was enveloped in their arms. Marta’s tears of pride mingled with the confetti in her hair. Leo was screaming her name. Abuela Elena held her hand, her old eyes burning bright. In the center of the chaotic, joyous storm, holding a trophy she barely registered, Catalina looked out past the swirling lights and cheering crowds. Across the stage, half-hidden in the shadows of the wings, Damián Ferrari was watching her. He raised his glass to her in a silent toast, a cool, proprietary smile playing on his lips. It was not a smile of concession. It was a smile of ownership. In that moment, Catalina understood. This was not the end of the war. It was just the beginning of a much more complicated one.### Chapter 6

The confetti was still falling, catching in her hair and on the shoulders of her mother’s dress, when Catalina was swept from the stage into the dizzying vortex of her new reality. The trophy, a heavy, abstract sculpture of glass and chrome, was pressed into her hands. It felt cold, alien, and utterly disconnected from the warmth of her mother’s tearful embrace or the frantic, joyous grip of Leo’s hug. Backstage was a chaotic blur of flashing camera bulbs, shouted congratulations, and unfamiliar faces leaning in to kiss her cheeks, their expensive perfumes mingling with the lingering scent of ozone from the stage lights. Men in sharp suits thrust business cards into her hands, their smiles wide and predatory. A frantic woman from the network’s publicity department was already trying to steer her toward a press line, speaking rapidly about morning show appearances and magazine exclusives.

It was Gustavo who became her shield. He materialized at her side, his large frame a welcome barrier against the encroaching tide. “Give her a minute, people,” he commanded, his stage manager’s voice cutting through the din. “She needs to be with her family.” He guided the Morales family into a small, starkly lit greenroom, the sudden quiet after the backstage chaos as jarring as a slap. Marta immediately began trying to brush the confetti from Catalina’s hair, her hands still trembling. Leo was staring at the trophy in Catalina’s hands as if it were a holy relic. “You won,” he kept repeating, the words full of wonder. “You actually won.”

In the midst of their pure, untroubled joy, Catalina felt a profound sense of dislocation. They saw the fairy tale ending. They saw the golden confetti and the glass trophy. They didn’t see the silent, chilling toast from Damián Ferrari. They didn’t understand that the monster hadn’t been slain; it had simply changed its shape. How could she explain to them that the most dangerous part was only just beginning? To voice her fear now would be to poison their happiness, a happiness she had fought so hard to give them. So she smiled, a performance more difficult than any song, and allowed herself to be held, feeling like a stranger at her own victory party.

The ride home in the black sedan was surreal. The same car that had transported her to her potential execution was now her victor’s chariot, but it felt more like a hermetically sealed capsule, insulating her from the world she had just won over. The streets of Buenos Aires, usually a symphony of life, were a silent film passing by her window. Marta and Leo chattered excitedly, reliving every moment of the finale, their voices bright and loud in the quiet car. Abuela Elena, however, was silent, her gaze fixed on her granddaughter. She seemed to sense the disquiet beneath Catalina’s placid surface, the way a sailor senses a change in the tide long before the storm arrives.

When they pulled up to their building in Almagro, it was past two in the morning, but the street was not quiet. A small crowd of neighbors had gathered on the pavement, spilling out from the entrance. As Catalina stepped out of the car, a cheer went up. Señor Rodriguez, his terrier yapping excitedly at his feet, raised a half-empty bottle of wine in a toast. Señora Diaz from 4C, a woman who usually only complained about noise, was beaming and blowing kisses. They had dragged a small radio out onto the stoop, and a cumbia was playing. The tiny, impromptu street party was more real and more moving than all the glittering chaos at the studio. This was her victory, not as Catalina Morales, the television star, but as Catita, their Catita, the girl from apartment 3B. For a moment, the weight on her shoulders lifted. She laughed, a real, genuine laugh, and hugged a weeping Señora Diaz.

Their apartment, which for so long had felt like a cage of worries, was now bursting with life. It had been transformed into a shrine of celebration. The table was laden with plates of empanadas and slices of cake brought by neighbors. The scent of victory, it turned out, smelled like fried dough, cheap sparkling cider, and community. But as the initial warmth of the reception wore off and the neighbors finally drifted back to their own homes, the reality of her new life began to intrude. She needed to speak to Rojas. After her family had finally, exhaustedly, gone to bed, Catalina sat alone in the living room, the glass trophy glinting on the mantelpiece like a malevolent idol, a far more dangerous version of the black rotary phone. She used her brother’s mobile phone, the number for Rojas still on the crumpled napkin, which she had smoothed out and saved as a talisman.

He answered on the second ring, his voice alert and sober, as if he had been sitting by the phone waiting. “I saw it,” he said, forgoing any greeting. “A masterful performance. You took their poison and turned it into your crown. I almost felt sorry for Ferrari.” Almost, Catalina noted. “He will not make the same mistake again,” Rojas continued, his voice losing its hint of admiration and taking on a sharp, clinical edge. “He will not try to destroy you now. That would make him a monster, and the public has decided you are a saint. No, his new strategy will be far more insidious.”

“What will he do?” Catalina asked, her voice a whisper in the quiet apartment.

“He will embrace you,” Rojas said, and the words sent a chill down her spine. “He will co-opt your rebellion. He will become your biggest champion. He will praise your courage, celebrate your authenticity, and promote you as the jewel his network discovered. He will not fight you; he will hug you to death, smothering your truth under a mountain of praise and publicity until you can no longer tell the difference between your own voice and the version of it he is selling. The cage is no longer made of iron bars, Catalina. It is made of adoration.”

The next morning proved Rojas’s words to be prophetic. An enormous, ostentatious arrangement of white lilies, so large it could barely fit through the door, arrived with a card written in an elegant, flowing script. “Your voice is a gift to us all. We are honored to be a part of your journey. Welcome to the family. – Damián.” The flowers filled the small living room with a funereal scent, an oppressive, cloying sweetness that felt like a beautiful threat. Then the phone calls started. Not from Damián, but from his army of smiling subordinates. A woman called to schedule a session with a celebrity stylist. A man called to discuss a high-profile endorsement for a soft drink. Everyone was unfailingly polite, endlessly enthusiastic, and completely deaf to any hint of hesitation on her part. They spoke as if her compliance was a foregone conclusion. She was no longer a person; she was a project, a brand, and they were the brand managers.

Later that afternoon, as she stood by the open window, the sounds of Buenos Aires rising up to meet her, the victory felt like a dream that was already fading. The mournful sigh of a bandoneon from a neighbor’s window no longer felt like a simple shared sorrow; it felt like a responsibility. She had been chosen, anointed as the keeper of that sound, of that truth. But the people who had given her the crown were now determined to control the head that wore it. She looked at the glass trophy on the mantelpiece, at the suffocating profusion of white lilies taking over their small apartment. She had won her battle on the public stage, but now the war had moved to a quieter, more intimate front: the battle for her own home, for her own mind. And she felt, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that this was a fight she was far less equipped to win.The morning after the victory, the apartment was no longer a haven. It had become the beachhead for Damián Ferrari’s new invasion, a campaign fought not with threats but with smothering floral arrangements and the cheerful, relentless tyranny of the telephone. The enormous bouquet of white lilies sat on a small table, its funereal perfume so thick it seemed to suck the familiar scent of coffee and toasted bread from the air. Marta fluttered around the flowers, touching their waxy petals with reverence, seeing them as a tribute. Catalina saw them as a beautiful, fragrant shroud, a reminder that Damián intended to preside over the death of her old self. The phone rang incessantly, each call a cheerful emissary from the empire that now owned her. A woman with a voice like honey called to discuss a media training schedule. A man with the brisk energy of a drill sergeant outlined a physical fitness regimen. They didn’t ask; they informed. Her life was being broken down into a series of manageable, marketable appointments.

Marta, blissfully unaware, was in heaven. She answered the phone with a new, proud flourish, “Residencia de la Señorita Morales,” as if they had moved into a palace overnight. To her, every call was another brick in the beautiful new life her daughter had won for them. “A stylist, Catita! They are sending a personal stylist to help you choose clothes! Can you imagine?” she’d exclaim, her eyes shining. Catalina would nod, the word “stylist” feeling like another link in a chain. How could she explain that she didn’t want someone to choose her clothes when she had just fought a war over choosing her own song? To her mother, this was the prize. To Catalina, it was the beginning of the erasure. She felt a growing, desperate sense of isolation, adrift on an ocean of her family’s joy, with only she who could see the circling fins of the sharks beneath.

The inevitable summons came two days later. It was not a call from Damián himself, but from a woman who introduced herself as Sofia Rey, his senior creative director. Her voice was warm, intelligent, and radiated a chic competence. She invited Catalina to a “welcome and planning brunch” at the Telecentro offices. “We are all so incredibly thrilled for you, Catalina,” Sofia effused. “We just want to sit down informally and dream a little about the amazing future we’re going to build together.” Marta, who overheard the invitation, was ecstatic. She spent an hour helping Catalina choose what to wear, finally settling on a simple linen dress. “You must look humble, but not poor,” she advised, with a loving but completely misguided grasp of the strategic performance now required. “You must remind them of the girl they fell in love with.” The irony was lost on her. They were already dressing her for a role.

The brunch was not held in one of the sterile offices but in a sun-drenched penthouse suite with panoramic views of the city. A long table was laden with pastries, tropical fruits, and freshly squeezed juices. It was a carefully staged scene of relaxed, creative collaboration. Sofia greeted her at the door with an air-kiss and a hug that felt both intimate and entirely impersonal. She was a woman in her late thirties, impeccably dressed in minimalist silk, her every gesture exuding an effortless power. “Catalina! You’re glowing!” she said, her smile brilliant. “I have to tell you, your performance… I’m not ashamed to admit I was in tears. We all were. You have a gift that is simply… divine.” The flattery was a soft cushion, designed to absorb any resistance. Sofia introduced her to the rest of the team: a sharp, young marketing analyst named Lucas and a veteran album producer with a weary, seen-it-all air.

They sat, and Sofia began to lay out the blueprint for what she called the “Catalina Morales Project.” She used words like “narrative,” “brand identity,” and “market penetration,” but she delivered them with the breathless excitement of an artist discussing a masterpiece. “The core of your brand, Catalina, is authenticity. It’s that raw, beautiful, unbroken connection to your roots. We’re not going to touch that. We are going to bottle it. We are going to protect it and amplify it and share it with the world.” She paused, her eyes gleaming. “And the first step is a massive cover story for *Gente* magazine. The biggest circulation in the country. They’re bumping a movie star for you. The theme they’ve developed is perfect. They’re calling it ‘A Rose from the Concrete’.”

The slogan hung in the air, poetic and deeply cynical. Catalina felt a familiar chill. She was a theme. A concept. Sofia, sensing a marketing triumph, pushed forward. “The visual idea is stunning. We’ll shoot it in the Rosedal, in Palermo. You, this pure, organic talent, this rose from the concrete, surrounded by the most perfect, cultivated roses in the city. The juxtaposition is genius! It will make you look like royalty, a true queen of the people.” The rest of the team nodded in enthusiastic agreement. The queen of the people, reigning from a manicured garden in the city’s wealthiest district, miles away from the cracked sidewalks and crumbling facades of her actual home. The erasure was happening right in front of her, gift-wrapped in a beautiful idea.

Catalina swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry. “The Rosedal… it’s beautiful,” she started, her voice hesitant. “But… I am not from Palermo.” Sofia’s smile didn’t falter, but a subtle, hard gloss came over her eyes. It was the first sign of friction, the first crack in the flawless facade of collaboration. “Of course you’re not, sweetie. That’s the whole point! It’s metaphor. It’s poetry. We are telling a story of transcendence. It’s not a documentary.” Her tone was still light, but it carried the unmistakable weight of a decision already made. Lucas, the marketing analyst, chimed in. “Our data shows that aspirational imagery resonates more strongly with the target demographic. Shooting in a location like Almagro… it can read as depressing, not inspiring.” They had data. They had demographics. All she had was the truth, and in this room, the truth was an inconvenient, unmarketable variable.

Remembering Rojas’s warning about the thousand tiny cuts, Catalina knew this was the first incision. To refuse would be to seem ungrateful, difficult, foolish. How could she argue against being made to look beautiful in a garden? It was an impossible position. “I… I need a moment to think about it,” she managed, the words feeling weak and inadequate. Sofia’s smile tightened, her warmth receding like a tide. “Of course. Take your time. But the magazine is holding the presses. We need to give them a final confirmation by the end of the day.” The request, which had been presented as a dream, was now revealed for what it was: a deadline. An ultimatum dressed in silk.

Catalina left the sun-drenched penthouse and walked out into the grey, noisy reality of the city. She felt more lost and defeated than she had in the face of Damián’s open hostility. That had been a clear fight. This was a battle fought in a fog, where every landmark was obscured by a smiling kindness that felt more dangerous than any threat. She didn’t go home. She found a quiet plaza, a small patch of real, unmanicured green, and sat on a bench. She thought of calling Rojas, but she knew what he would say. He couldn’t fight this for her. This was her war now, a war of inches and nuances. To refuse the photoshoot was to declare war on her own success, to be branded a diva. To accept was to take the first step in a dance of complicity, to agree that her story was a commodity they could package and sell as they saw fit.

She watched an old man feeding pigeons, his movements slow and deliberate, and she thought of her abuela’s hands, the web of wrinkles and veins a testament to a life of work and love. *Her hands are the concrete that I grew from.* The thought, so clear and true, cut through the fog of confusion. It gave her an idea. It was not a refusal, but an amendment. It was not a declaration of war, but a negotiation of truth. Taking a deep breath, she walked to a corner store, bought a phone card, and found a public telephone, its receiver heavy and solid in her hand. She dialed the number for Sofia’s direct line. When the creative director’s smooth, expectant voice answered, Catalina’s own voice was calm and steady.

“Sofia, it’s Catalina. I’ve thought about the photoshoot. I’ll do it.” A wave of audible relief came through the line. “Catalina! Wonderful! I knew you’d see the beauty in it. You won’t regret this.” Catalina let her finish, then she played her hand. “Yes, and I have a condition.” A surprised silence. “The theme is ‘A Rose from the Concrete,’ correct? I believe that’s a beautiful idea.” She paused. “I will be bringing my abuela with me. Her hands are the concrete. They are the story. I want a photograph of me holding her hands. If you are telling a story about my roots, then you must show the roots themselves.” A profound, stunned silence echoed back from the penthouse suite. Catalina had just thrown a piece of non-aspirational, inconvenient, and utterly undeniable truth right into the middle of their perfect, metaphorical picture. The battle had been joined.### Chapter 7

The silence that stretched over the phone line was not empty. It was a dense, tactical quiet, filled with the whirring of unseen calculations. Catalina could practically visualize Sofia Rey in her sun-drenched penthouse, her perfect smile momentarily frozen as she processed this unexpected move. It was not insubordination; it was a counter-proposal, a piece of creative input so perfectly aligned with their own cynical branding—'A Rose from the Concrete'—that to refuse it would be to expose the hypocrisy of the entire exercise. When Sofia finally spoke, her voice had lost none of its warmth, but it was now laced with the metallic glint of a fencer acknowledging a worthy opponent’s touché.

“Catalina… that is a beautiful, beautiful thought,” she said, her recovery seamless. “An absolutely inspired idea. It brings such a layer of emotional depth. Of course. We would be honored to have your abuela join us. Just let us know what she needs, and we will arrange everything. The car will be sent for you both tomorrow morning at nine.” The agreement was too quick, too smooth. Catalina understood instantly: Sofia hadn't been defeated; she had simply pivoted. If she couldn’t stop Catalina from bringing a piece of the real world into their fantasy, she would simply direct it, light it, and absorb it into the narrative until it, too, became part of the beautiful lie.

When Catalina explained the plan to her family, the reactions were exactly as she had anticipated. Marta was aghast. “Your abuela? To a photoshoot? Catita, she is eighty-four years old! All those people, the hot lights… it will be too much for her. It is not right to put her on display like a… like a museum piece!” Her protective instincts warred with her awe of the magazine, her face a knot of confusion and worry. Leo, on the other hand, thought it was a masterstroke. “That’s brilliant! You’re hacking the system, Catita! You’re making them play your game!”

It was Abuela Elena, sitting in her usual armchair and listening to the debate, who settled it. She had been observing Catalina with her unnervingly perceptive gaze. She understood this was not about fame or vanity. This was a chess move, and her granddaughter had just placed her on the board as a queen. “Marta, be quiet,” she said, her voice soft but firm, cutting through her daughter’s anxious chatter. She beckoned Catalina closer. “They want a story about a rose from the concrete?” she asked, her lips curling into a knowing, almost mischievous smile. She held up her hands, palms open. They were a roadmap of a life, the skin thin as parchment over a lattice of swollen knuckles and raised blue veins, the fingers gnarled from a lifetime of scrubbing, kneading, and holding on. “If these old hands can be a shield for you, mija, then they will be. I will go. I will show them the concrete.”

The next morning, the black sedan, now a familiar sight on their street, arrived to collect not one, but two generations of Morales women. Abuela Elena was dressed in her best black dress, the one she wore for weddings and baptisms, a small, tarnished silver locket her only jewelry. She sat beside Catalina, her posture erect, her hands resting calmly in her lap as the car sped them away from the familiar chaos of Almagro and toward the manicured elegance of Palermo. She looked out the window not with the wide-eyed wonder of a tourist, but with the dispassionate curiosity of an anthropologist observing the strange customs of a foreign tribe.

The Rosedal was a breathtaking explosion of color and order. Thousands of perfect roses, in every conceivable shade, bloomed in meticulously sculpted beds. But overlaying this natural beauty was the jarring imposition of the fashion industry. A huge white tent had been erected on the grass. Racks of designer clothes, lighting rigs, and a swarm of black-clad crew members milled about with an air of urgent self-importance. Catalina, in her simple dress, and her abuela, in her Sunday best, felt like figures from a sepia photograph who had wandered into a vibrant, alien world.

Sofia greeted them with a flurry of air-kisses, her attention immediately zeroing in on Elena. “Abuela! It is an absolute honor! You are even more beautiful than Catalina described.” Her charm was a high-powered weapon, but it glanced harmlessly off Elena’s quiet dignity. “Thank you for coming all this way. We have a comfortable chair for you, some water, anything you need.” She was treating Elena with the careful, exaggerated reverence one might afford a fragile, priceless artifact. A stylist rushed forward, a makeup brush in hand. “Just a touch of powder to take down the shine for the camera, Abuela?” she chirped.

Elena did not even flinch. She simply looked the young woman in the eye and said, with profound, unshakable authority, “No.” The single word, delivered without anger or arrogance, was a brick wall. The stylist froze, looking to Sofia for guidance. For the first time, Sofia’s poise faltered. She had planned to manage this piece of authenticity, but she hadn’t counted on the authenticity having its own, unmanageable will. She recovered quickly. “Of course! Natural is best! We want that beautiful character to shine through,” she announced, waving the stylist away. It was a small victory, but it shifted the balance of power on the set.

The photoshoot began. Catalina was zipped into a flowing, blush-colored couture gown that cost more than her family’s annual income. She was posed among the roses, the photographer shouting instructions. “Chin up! Look wistful! Give me longing!” She felt like a doll, her body a mannequin to be arranged. But every few minutes, her gaze would find her abuela, sitting patiently on her chair just beyond the lights, a small, unmovable island of reality in the sea of artifice. That silent presence was her anchor. Finally, the photographer, a intense man named Antoine, called out, “Okay! Let’s get the abuela. I want the shot with the hands.”

Elena was brought to the set. She stood beside her granddaughter, a small, straight-backed figure in black against the frothy pink of Catalina’s gown and the riot of color from the roses. She looked neither impressed nor intimidated. “Okay, Catalina, hold her hands,” Antoine directed. “Look into the camera. Give me… pride. Give me… heritage.” Catalina ignored him. She took her grandmother’s hands in her own, her soft, smooth skin a stark contrast to the wrinkled, work-worn texture of Elena’s. She didn’t look at the camera. She looked down at their joined hands. She saw the hands that had changed her diapers, that had stirred the pots of stew, that had braided her hair, that had clapped for her at school concerts, that had held her own father when he was a boy. She saw the story of her life, of her family’s survival and love, written there in the language of skin and bone. A genuine, unbidden tear traced a path through her makeup.

Antoine was silent. He had stopped shouting. He just kept shooting, the click of his camera the only sound. He was no longer a fashion photographer. He was a witness. Sofia stood behind him, watching on a monitor, her expression unreadable. She had wanted a metaphor, a beautiful, marketable idea of a rose from the concrete. What she was getting was the thing itself, raw and potent and far more powerful than anything she could have conceived. She had wanted to bottle Catalina’s authenticity, and Catalina had responded by smashing the bottle and showing her the source of the river.

The ride home was quiet, filled with a shared, bone-deep exhaustion. Abuela Elena fell asleep, her head resting lightly on Catalina’s shoulder. As they drove back into the familiar, chaotic embrace of Almagro, Catalina looked out the window. The city no longer seemed so frightening. She felt a deep, settled calm she hadn't felt since the first phone call. She hadn’t just survived another battle. She had brought her strongest ally onto the field. The war of inches was still hers to fight, but she was no longer fighting it alone. She was fighting it hand in hand with the woman who was her history, her shield, her truth. The concrete itself had come to the rose’s defense.The week that followed the photoshoot was a strange, suspended limbo. The phone calls from the network tapered off, and an unnerving quiet descended, as if both armies had retreated to their camps to re-evaluate the terrain after a surprising skirmish. Catalina spent the days in her apartment, the rhythms of her old life a comforting balm. She helped her mother with the grocery shopping, listened to Leo’s breathless accounts of his video game conquests, and sat with her abuela in the slivers of afternoon sun that fell on their small balcony. But beneath the surface of this familiar domesticity, a tense anticipation hummed. She felt like an actress waiting for a review, knowing that the story of what happened in the Rosedal would not be hers to write. It would be told in the glossy pages of *Gente*, and she could only wait to see what version of her they had decided to create.

The magazine hit the newsstands on a Tuesday morning. Catalina saw it from her window, a stack of them delivered to the corner kiosk, her own face looking out from the cover, serene and beautiful amongst a sea of perfect pink roses. The headline, in elegant script, was exactly as Sofia had said: “A Rose from the Concrete.” Her stomach clenched. Taking a deep breath, she went down to the street, the short walk feeling like a mile. Buying the magazine felt like purchasing a verdict on her own life. She didn't open it until she was back in the relative safety of the apartment, spreading it out on the dining table like a piece of evidence.

The layout was stunningly beautiful, a multi-page spread of artistic, sun-drenched photographs. There was Catalina in the flowing gown, looking wistful among the rose bushes. There was a close-up of her face, a single, perfect tear tracing a path down her cheek. And then, taking up an entire page, was the photograph of the hands. It was shot in exquisite black and white, a stark, powerful contrast to the lush color of the other photos. Their two sets of hands were the sole focus: Elena’s, gnarled and eloquent with history, cradled by Catalina’s, smooth and unblemished. It was an image of undeniable power, a work of art in itself. Catalina felt a swell of pride, of relief. They had used it. They had shown the truth.

Then she began to read the article. The text, written by a prominent lifestyle journalist, was a masterpiece of sentimental appropriation. It described Catalina as a “miracle,” a “once-in-a-generation talent discovered and nurtured by the visionary team at Telecentro.” It lavished praise on Sofia Rey for her “instinct to dig deeper, to find the emotional core of her artists.” The photoshoot was portrayed not as a negotiation, but as a stroke of collaborative genius conceived by the creative team to honor Catalina’s roots. Her insistence on including her abuela was not mentioned. Instead, the article read: “In a moment of pure inspiration, the creative team decided to bring Catalina’s beloved abuela, Elena, onto the set, creating an unforgettable tableau of generational love. The resulting photograph of their joined hands, a symbol of the hardworking family from which this beautiful rose has sprung, is a testament to the show’s commitment to telling authentic stories.”

Catalina felt the blood drain from her face. They hadn’t buried her act of defiance; they had stolen it. They had taken her one, true move, polished it, put a frame around it, and hung it on their own wall, taking credit for its creation. She was no longer the artist who had fought for her truth; she was the beautiful, passive subject of their visionary storytelling. Marta came to look over her shoulder, her eyes welling up with happy tears as she looked at the picture of her mother’s hands. “¡Ay, qué belleza! It’s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. They made her look like a saint, Catita. They understand. They truly understand your heart.” She saw only the beautiful image, heard only the flattering words. She could not see the subtle, brilliant theft that had just taken place. In that moment, Catalina had never felt more alone. The victory in the Rosedal had been a mirage.

That evening, she spoke with Rojas. He had, of course, already read the article. “A beautiful piece of propaganda,” he grunted over the phone. “Sofia Rey is a very clever woman. She saw you were bringing a sword to a poetry reading, so she simply praised your sword as the finest poem of all.” His words, cynical and blunt, were a strange comfort, the only honest reflection of the situation she had heard all day. “You cannot win by surprising them with the truth, Catalina. They will just hire a better writer to rewrite it. You showed them your heart, and they put it in a beautiful display case with their corporate logo etched on the glass.”

“So what do I do?” she asked, the frustration and exhaustion evident in her voice. “How can I fight them when they keep agreeing with me?”

“You stop fighting them on their field,” Rojas advised. “Photoshoots, interviews, public appearances—that is their territory. They control the narrative. Your field, your only true ground, is the music. The first album. That is the next battle, and it will be the most important one. They will try to fill it with songs like that power ballad, songs that sound like success. You must make sure your own songs, your grandfather’s songs, are on that record. Not as a novelty, not as a ‘folk-inspired track,’ but as the soul of the album itself. That is where you make your stand. Everything else is a distraction.”

As if on cue, the email arrived the next day. It was from Sofia’s office, a cheerful, exclamation-point-filled invitation to a meeting to “kick off the creative process for your debut album!” She was to meet with Sofia and the producer they had assigned to the project. His name was Daniel Vega, a celebrated hitmaker known for his slick, radio-friendly productions. The meeting was in two days. The next battle was about to begin. The distraction was over.### Chapter 8

The two days leading up to the album meeting were a period of intense, quiet preparation. Catalina understood this was not another performance; it was a negotiation for the future of her voice. She did not call Rojas. His advice had been clear—this was her ground to defend—and she knew she could not rely on him to fight every battle. Instead, she turned to her own history. She spent hours in the stuffy quiet of the back bedroom, a space that still held the faint scent of her father’s cologne clinging to an old jacket in the closet. She went through a worn cardboard box that contained his musical legacy: a jumble of cassette tapes with muffled recordings from smoky peñas, a few photographs of him on makeshift stages, and, most importantly, a leather-bound journal filled with his elegant, sloping handwriting. It contained not just lyrics and chord progressions for traditional zambas and tangos, but his own compositions—songs of love for her mother, of frustration with the city, of quiet, profound hope for his children. These were not just songs; they were his diaries, his heart committed to paper. She carefully selected a dozen, a mix of her grandfather’s classics and her father’s undiscovered treasures, and photocopied them, placing the copies in a neat folder. This was her arsenal.

Her family saw only the surface. “A meeting with a famous producer!” Marta exclaimed, ironing Catalina’s best blouse with reverent care. “He will make your album sound so modern, so expensive! You will be on the radio in Miami, in Madrid!” To her mother, success was a sound, a glossy sheen to be applied to her daughter’s raw talent. She could not understand that Catalina was preparing to fight against that very sheen. As she left the apartment, the folder held tightly under her arm, her abuela caught her hand. The old woman said nothing, but squeezed her fingers, a silent transfer of strength, a reminder of the concrete from which she had sprung.

The meeting was held in a place designed to communicate power and success: a state-of-the-art recording studio in the heart of Palermo. It was a cathedral of modern sound, all polished concrete floors, warm wood paneling, and a vast mixing console that glittered under recessed lighting like the control panel of a starship. It smelled of new electronics and ambition. Sofia Rey was there, looking effortlessly chic, a welcoming smile fixed on her face. Beside her stood a man who was clearly her opposite. He was Daniel Vega. He was not a suit. He wore faded jeans, a vintage band t-shirt, and had a well-groomed beard, his eyes warm and intelligent. He looked less like a corporate hitmaker and more like a musician she might have met in a San Telmo bar. His handshake was firm, his smile genuine. “Catalina, it’s a real honor,” he said, his voice a low, friendly rumble. “What you did on that stage… that was pure magic. I’m a music guy, not a suit. My only job is to help you take that magic and share it with as many people as possible.” His words were a disarming melody, and for a moment, Catalina allowed herself to hope.

They sat on a low leather sofa facing the massive studio window. Sofia, ever the gracious host, began. “So, Catalina, we are just vibrating with excitement. Daniel is the best in the business, and he has been working day and night, sketching out some initial sonic directions for you. We see this album as an evolution. ‘Corazón de la Canción’ was Chapter One, the story of where you came from. The album is Chapter Two: the story of where you are going.” Daniel nodded, leaning forward with an artist’s enthusiasm. “Exactly. I’ve listened to your finale performance about a hundred times. The purity, the passion… it’s an incredible foundation. What I want to do is build a palace on top of it.” He picked up an iPad and, with a few taps, the studio was filled with sound. A massive, pulsing beat erupted from speakers that cost more than her family’s apartment, followed by a slick synth riff and a soaring, anthemic chorus. It was expertly crafted, undeniably catchy, and had absolutely nothing to do with her. He played three more demos, each a different flavor of modern Latin pop, each polished to an impersonal perfection. When the last track faded, he looked at her, his eyes shining. “This is the sound of a global star, Catalina. Your voice on top of these tracks… it would be unstoppable.”

Catalina listened to it all, her heart sinking with each perfectly compressed kick drum. She did not interrupt. She did not grimace. She held her folder in her lap, feeling the reassuring weight of her father’s journal pages within it. When Daniel finished, a hopeful, expectant silence filled the room. This was her moment. She took a breath. “Thank you, Daniel. It’s clear you are a master at what you do. The production is incredible.” The compliment was genuine, and it made both him and Sofia visibly relax. “You said you want to build a palace on my foundation. I love that idea,” she continued, her voice steady. “But I believe that for the palace to be strong, it has to be built from the same stone as the foundation.” She opened her folder and laid the photocopied pages of her father’s songs on the low table between them. The spidery, handwritten notes and faded staff lines looked like ancient manuscripts next to his gleaming iPad. “This is the stone,” she said softly. “These are the songs of my father, the zambas of my grandfather. This is the story I want to tell. Not just where I came from, but who I am. I believe we can make these songs sound… new. We can build your palace. But it must be with these materials. This must be the heart of the album.”

The shift in the room was palpable. Sofia’s welcoming smile became a fixed, patient mask. Daniel Vega’s friendly, artistic demeanor vanished, replaced by the cool, appraising gaze of a professional whose expertise had been questioned by an amateur. He picked up one of the pages, holding it as if it were a quaint, curious artifact. “Catalina, I respect your connection to this music. I truly do,” he began, his tone shifting from collaborator to lecturer. “But from a production standpoint, from a commercial standpoint… this is not viable. The song structures are archaic. The melodies don’t have the kind of hooks that modern radio requires. There’s no space for a drop, the bridges are too lyrical… It’s beautiful, as folk art. But my job isn’t to curate a museum. My job is to get you on the charts.” Every word was a professionally delivered dismissal, a death by a thousand technical cuts. He wasn’t insulting her music; he was simply explaining, with the full weight of his success and experience, why it was worthless in the world they now inhabited.

Sofia stepped in to deliver the final, gentle blow. “Daniel is right, Catalina. We have to be strategic. The label has invested heavily in you. We all have. We can absolutely include one of these songs on the album, as a special acoustic bonus track, perhaps. A nod to your roots. But the singles, the core of the album, must be what Daniel has prepared. It’s the only way to guarantee a return on that investment. It’s the only way to ensure you have a long-term career.” Her voice was laced with a tone of kind, irrefutable logic. A bonus track. They were offering to relegate her entire identity to a footnote on her own album. The meeting had reached its foregone conclusion. Catalina felt a wave of despair, but beneath it, the quiet embers of her defiance still glowed. “I understand your position,” she said, gathering her pages from the table. “I will need some time to consider it.” It was a retreat, not a surrender, but in the sterile silence of the studio, it felt perilously close to the same thing.

She left the studio and walked out into the afternoon light, feeling drained and defeated. She had made her stand, and the ground had crumbled beneath her. The weight of the marketing data, the hitmaker’s expertise, and the label’s investment was an immovable mountain. She walked aimlessly, her mind a turmoil of doubt and frustration, her father’s songs feeling heavy and useless in her bag. She was halfway down the block when she heard her name called. “Catalina! Wait up.” It was Daniel Vega, jogging to catch up with her, his face now free of the professional mask he wore in the studio. He looked conflicted, almost weary. “Hey,” he said, his voice low, glancing back toward the studio entrance. “Listen, what I said in there… it’s the job. The suits have their formulas, and I get paid a lot of money to execute them.”

He fell into step beside her, his hands in his pockets. “But I was a musician before I was a producer. I played in punk bands in shitty bars for ten years. I know what it’s like to have a song in your gut that you have to get out.” He stopped and turned to face her, his expression serious. “Off the record, completely off the record… don’t give up on those songs. But you can’t just show them the paper. You have to make them hear it. The suits, Sofia, even me… we can’t imagine what we haven’t heard before. You’re asking us to take a leap of faith in a business that punishes faith.” He paused, a plan seeming to form in his mind. “I have a friend, an old sound engineer. He has a small, independent studio in Chacarita. It’s nothing fancy, just a room with some good mics. I’ll make a call. Go there. Record one of them. Just you and a guitar. No band, no palace. Just the foundation. Make a demo. Bring me a recording that I can’t say no to. If you can make me believe in it, maybe I can find a way to make them believe in it.” He scribbled a name and address on a piece of paper and pressed it into her hand. “Go on, kid. Show me the magic.” He gave her a quick, conspiratorial nod and then turned and walked away, leaving Catalina standing on the pavement, holding a new, unexpected, and terrifyingly difficult key in her hand.The crumpled piece of paper in her hand felt heavier than the glass trophy on her mantelpiece. It was a lifeline, but it was also a gauntlet thrown down. Daniel Vega’s off-the-record confession had revealed a crack in the monolithic wall of the industry, a small fissure of artistic conscience. But he had not offered her a rescue; he had challenged her to prove her own truth was compelling enough to risk his professional capital on. He had put the entire weight of her heritage back onto her own shoulders and told her to make it sing in a language his bosses couldn't ignore. She knew, with absolute certainty, that going home to the apartment, to her mother’s well-intentioned but misguided advice, would extinguish this fragile spark of an idea. This was a pilgrimage she had to make alone. She hailed a taxi, the name of the neighborhood a foreign word on her lips: “Chacarita, por favor.”

The journey was a cross-section of the city’s soul, leaving the manicured, European elegance of Palermo behind, moving through the dense, pulsing arteries of commerce, and finally settling into the quiet, melancholic grace of Chacarita. The neighborhood lived in the long shadow of its famous cemetery, and the air here seemed different, imbued with a sense of history and a respect for the past. It was a place of memory, and Catalina felt a strange sense of homecoming. The address Daniel had given her was not a gleaming studio but a simple, unmarked wooden door next to a closed flower shop on a quiet, tree-lined street. It looked less like an entrance to a business and more like a portal to a secret world. Taking a deep breath, she knocked.

The door was opened by a man who seemed to be carved from the same aged wood as his surroundings. He was perhaps sixty, with a wild halo of grey hair, a faded t-shirt for a band she’d never heard of, and eyes that were tired but incredibly sharp behind smudged glasses. This had to be Pato. He grunted a hello and looked her up and down, his expression a mixture of skepticism and curiosity. “You’re the kid from the TV,” he stated, not asked. “Daniel called. Said you had something you needed to get out. Come on in.” He led her not into a lounge, but directly into the studio itself. It was a single, large room, a cozy cavern filled with the glorious, chaotic clutter of a life dedicated to sound. Vintage guitars hung on the walls like sleeping animals, amplifiers were stacked in dusty towers, and in the center of it all was a magnificent, museum-quality reel-to-reel tape machine, its large spools waiting patiently. The room smelled of old vacuum tubes, floor polish, and something that smelled like pure potential.

Pato wasted no time on pleasantries. He gestured to a worn wooden stool in the center of the room. “Daniel said just a voice and a guitar. There’s a Martin over there,” he said, pointing to an old acoustic guitar resting on a stand. “She’s got a few scars, but her voice is honest.” He then went about setting up a single, large, antique-looking microphone, handling it with the reverence of a priest preparing a sacrament. There was no talk of charts, of demographics, of palaces. The only thing that seemed to matter in this room was capturing a true sound. Catalina picked up the guitar; it felt warm and alive in her hands, a stark contrast to the sterile instruments provided by the network. She sat on the stool, the single microphone before her like a confessor. “Okay,” Pato’s voice crackled through the headphones he placed over her ears. “Whenever you’re ready. Just sing.”

The first take was a disaster. Her hands were trembling, her voice tight with nerves. She was trying to create a perfect demo, to impress Daniel, to win the argument. The result was a technically proficient but soulless performance. The second take was no better. She could feel the song’s magic slipping through her fingers, suffocated by her own desperate need to prove its worth. Pato let her finish, then there was a long silence over the headphones. Catalina’s eyes stung with frustration. She had been given this one chance, and she was failing. “Alright, stop,” Pato’s voice finally said, calm and measured. “Stop trying to sell me a song. I don’t buy music, I just record it. Let me ask you something, kid. Forget about me, forget about Daniel, forget about the record label. Who are you singing this song for?”

His question cut through the fog of her anxiety. Who was she singing for? The answer was so obvious, so fundamental, that she had completely forgotten it. She wasn’t singing for a producer or a contract. She took off the headphones, placing them gently on the floor. She closed her eyes, shutting out the unfamiliar studio, the intimidating microphone, the weight of expectation. She chose the song, one of her father’s most personal compositions. It wasn’t a grand tango or a tragic zamba; it was a simple, quiet lullaby he had written for her when she was a baby, a song about finding constellations in the city’s electric glow and seeing a future in a sleeping child’s face. She didn’t sing it to the microphone. She sang it into the quiet of the room as if she were singing across time, sending her voice back to the ghost of the young man with a cheap guitar and a heart full of hope, a man who never got to see his daughter on a stage.

Her voice, when it came, was a reedy whisper, fragile and unadorned. She didn’t perform; she confessed. She let her voice crack on a high note, let a breath catch in her throat on a line about his calloused hands. She wasn't an artist executing a piece of music; she was a daughter having a conversation with her father. The old Martin guitar seemed to understand, its woody, honest tone wrapping around her voice like a familiar embrace. When the final, gentle chord faded into the dust-filled air of the studio, she kept her eyes closed, tears tracing silent paths down her cheeks. The silence in the room was absolute, sacred.

After a long moment, she heard the quiet click and whir of the tape machine rewinding. She opened her eyes. Pato stood by the console, his back to her. He didn’t say a word. He simply pressed play. The sound that filled the room was devastatingly pure. It was her own voice, but it was a voice she had never truly heard before. It was stripped of all artifice, all performance. It was the sound of love, of loss, of a connection that death could not sever. It was the truth, captured on a fragile ribbon of magnetic tape. Pato slowly turned from the console, his gruff facade gone, his tired eyes shining with an emotion he didn’t try to hide. He simply nodded at her, a gesture of profound, shared understanding. He knew what they had just captured. She had done it. She hadn’t just made a demo. She had bottled lightning.Pato did not speak for a long time. He stood with his back to her, listening as the last echo of the song died in the room, then he carefully lifted the tone arm on a turntable he’d used to cut a direct lacquer disc from the tape. With the deliberate, gentle movements of a watchmaker, he transferred the recording, first to the disc, and then from the disc to a simple, unadorned USB drive. The entire process was a quiet, reverent ritual, translating the analog soul of the music into a digital format the modern world could understand. He did not offer to add reverb, to compress the vocal, or to sweeten the sound in any way. To do so would have been an act of desecration. He handed the small plastic drive to Catalina, his gruff expression softened by a profound respect.

“There it is, kid. The truth in a bottle,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “Now, they’re going to want to take this and drown it in an ocean of strings and synthesizers. They’ll tell you it’s to make it bigger, to make it 'accessible.' Don’t let them. Everything it needs to say, it’s already saying. You just have to make sure they’re quiet enough to listen.” He walked her to the heavy wooden door and paused, placing a calloused hand on her shoulder. “You’ve got a good fight in you. Reminds me of the old days. Now go give ‘em hell.”

Leaving the dusty, sacred space of Pato’s studio was like waking from a profound dream. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows down the quiet streets of Chacarita, and the air was cool on her tear-stained cheeks. The small USB drive in her hand was a warm, physical weight, a concentration of all her fear and all her hope. She knew with a chilling certainty that she could not go home. She could not face her mother’s hopeful questions or the silent judgment of the wilting lilies in the living room. To return to that world now would be to lose the fierce, fragile momentum she had gained. The magic was in the bottle, but she knew magic had an expiration date. She had to act now. She walked to the main avenue and hailed a taxi, her voice clear and resolute as she gave the driver the address of the studio in Palermo.

The state-of-the-art facility was a jarring contrast to the warm, human clutter of Pato’s studio. Here, everything was clean, cold, and designed for efficiency. It was almost evening, and the frantic energy of the day had subsided, but lights were still on in several of the rooms. Catalina walked through the automatic glass doors, her simple clothes and determined expression feeling entirely out of place amidst the sleek, corporate decor. A young assistant at the front desk looked up, her eyes widening in recognition. Before she could ask Catalina’s business, Daniel Vega emerged from a corridor, holding a container of takeout coffee, looking tired and preoccupied. He stopped dead when he saw her.

“Catalina,” he said, surprise and a hint of apprehension in his voice. “I wasn’t expecting… is everything okay?” She met his gaze, her own expression unreadable. She didn’t answer his question. Instead, she held up the small USB drive between her thumb and forefinger. “You told me to show you the magic,” she said, her voice even and devoid of any plea. “You told me to bring you a recording you couldn’t say no to. Here it is.”

He stared at the small piece of plastic, then back at her face. He saw no hint of compromise in her eyes, only a quiet, unshakeable conviction. Something shifted in his expression, the weary producer giving way to the curious musician. He sighed, a long, drawn-out sound, and gestured with his head toward a small, private listening room down the hall. “Alright, Catita,” he said, a note of resignation in his tone. “Let’s see what you’ve got.” The room was small and acoustically perfect, dominated by a single pair of ruinously expensive studio monitors. Daniel sank into a leather chair, gestured for her to plug the drive into the console, and leaned back, crossing his arms as if bracing for impact. He did not put on headphones. He wanted to hear it in the air, in the room, with no escape.

Catalina pressed play. The song began. It was not a wall of sound. It was a single, cracked note from an old guitar, followed by a breath. Then her voice, stripped bare of all performance, filled the small, perfect room. It was not the powerful, soaring instrument from the television finale. It was a fragile, intimate whisper, a story told in a quiet room after all the guests have gone home. The sound was so raw, so honest, it felt like an intrusion, like listening to a private prayer. Daniel, who had been leaning back with a critical posture, slowly sat forward. He uncrossed his arms. He rested his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and closed his eyes. The lullaby unfolded, its simple melody a devastating counterpoint to the sophisticated technology surrounding them. The quiet click and scrape of her fingers on the fretboard, the slight catch in her throat, the audible breath before the final verse—Pato had kept it all, every beautiful, human flaw. It wasn’t a demo. It was a confession.

The final chord of the guitar faded, leaving behind a silence so profound it felt louder than the music had been. Catalina did not dare to breathe. Daniel did not move for a full minute. He just sat with his head in his hands, perfectly still. Finally, he lifted his head and looked at her. The professional mask of the hitmaker was gone. His eyes were red-rimmed, his expression stripped bare. He looked like a man who had just been reminded of a fundamental truth he had spent years trying to forget.

“In all my years,” he said, his voice thick and hoarse, “in all the thousands of hours I have spent polishing sounds to make them perfect, I have never, ever heard anything that perfect.” He stood up and began to pace the small room, running a hand through his hair, agitated and electrified. “They will hate it. Sofia will say it’s a suicide note. The marketing department will say it has zero radio potential. They will say it’s depressing. They will say it’s a career-killer.” He stopped pacing and turned to face her, a wild, reckless light in his eyes that she had not seen before—the light of the punk rocker in the shitty bar. “They will be wrong.” He walked to the console, ejected the USB drive, and held it in his palm, looking at it as if it were a detonator. “Okay, Catalina Morales,” he said, a slow, dangerous smile spreading across his face. “You brought the magic. Now let’s go start a fire.”### Chapter 9

Daniel Vega’s declaration hung in the acoustically perfect air of the listening room, a vow of insurrection. The wild, reckless light in his eyes was not just defiance; it was the gleam of an artist who had been reminded of his own soul. He grabbed a blank notepad and a pen, the energy now crackling off him, transforming him from a weary industry veteran into a field general planning a blitzkrieg. “Okay, listen to me,” he said, his voice low and urgent. “We can’t just walk this into Ferrari’s office. He’ll crush it with a single phone call. And we can’t just play it for Sofia. Her job is to manage risk, and this,” he tapped the USB drive still in his hand, “is a beautiful, terrifying risk. We can’t convince their minds. We have to ambush their hearts.”

He began scribbling on the notepad, a diagram of names and departments. “There’s an album planning meeting tomorrow at ten. It’s with Sofia, Lucas from marketing, the head of A&R, and a few others. The whole ‘Catalina Project’ brain trust. They’ll be expecting me to present polished demos of the pop tracks. They’ll have spreadsheets and market-testing data. They will be armed with logic. We are going to walk in there and stage a coup.” The idea was audacious, terrifying, and brilliant. He was proposing to turn a corporate meeting into a moment of artistic reckoning. “I’m going to set the stage,” he continued, pacing again. “But you… you are the weapon. You’re not going to say a word. You’re just going to sit there. When they see you, and they hear this song, they won’t just be listening to a demo. They’ll be bearing witness. It’s much harder to say no to a person than to a file on a computer.”

Catalina felt a surge of fear mixed with a heady, unfamiliar rush of power. She was no longer a lone supplicant pleading for her heritage. She was a co-conspirator, a vital piece in a daring act of sabotage. “What if they fire you?” she asked, the question a stark acknowledgment of the stakes. Daniel stopped pacing and gave her a wry, tired smile. “They can’t fire me, kid. I’ve made them too much money. But they can sideline me, put me on a leash, take this project away. That’s the risk.” He looked at the USB drive, then back at her. “It’s been a long time since I believed in a song enough to take a real risk. Let’s not waste it.”

The next morning, Catalina walked back into the Telecentro building, but this time she was not alone. She walked beside Daniel Vega, and the difference was palpable. The assistants who had previously avoided her gaze now offered nervous, respectful smiles. Walking with Daniel was like having a backstage pass to the entire operation. He didn't lead her to the penthouse suite but to a large, glass-walled conference room on the executive floor. It was the epitome of corporate sterility: a long, polished table, ergonomic chairs, and a massive screen at one end for presentations. Sofia was already there, chatting with Lucas, the young marketing analyst. They both looked up as Daniel and Catalina entered, their smiles faltering for a microsecond. They had not expected her to be at this meeting.

“Catalina! What a wonderful surprise,” Sofia said, recovering instantly, her voice a melody of warmth and control. “I thought we’d handle the technical prep first and bring you in for the creative sessions later.” Daniel answered for her, pulling out a chair for Catalina at the table, a gesture of undeniable inclusion. “Catalina is the creative, Sofia. I thought it was time she was in the room where the decisions are made.” The quiet challenge was unmistakable. Two more executives filed in, the head of A&R and a senior publicist, and the meeting began. Sofia took charge, her agenda projected onto the large screen. It was a list of action items, timelines, and marketing bullet points. “As you can see,” she began, “our primary goal for Q4 is to establish Catalina as a crossover artist. Daniel has prepared some incredible tracks designed to hit the key streaming playlists. Daniel, if you’d like to start with the first single…”

This was the moment. Daniel stood up, but he didn’t go to the main console. He walked to the center of the room, holding the small USB drive. “Before we get into the singles,” he said, his voice calm and commanding, his presence filling the room, “I want to re-establish the foundation. We’ve been throwing around the word ‘authenticity’ in these meetings for weeks. I want us all to be clear on what that word actually sounds like.” The executives exchanged confused glances. Sofia’s smile was frozen on her face, her eyes narrowing. She opened her mouth to interrupt, to steer the meeting back to her agenda, but Daniel was already moving. He dimmed the lights with a remote, plunging the sunlit, corporate room into a moody twilight. He plugged the drive into a small port on the conference table and hit play.

The song began, not with a bang, but with the quiet, flawed sound of a real guitar in a real room. And then Catalina’s voice, fragile and unadorned, filled the air. The effect was immediate and profound. The sterile conference room was instantly rendered absurd by the raw, human emotion pouring from the speakers. Lucas, the marketing analyst, stopped looking at his phone, his face a mask of confusion. The head of A&R, a man known for his brutal, commercial instincts, leaned back in his chair, his eyes closed. The senior publicist stared at Catalina, who sat silent and composed, her hands folded in her lap, her gaze fixed on a point beyond the glass wall. She was not a product being discussed; she was the artist bearing witness to her own soul being laid bare.

The lullaby was a ghost in the machine, a whispered truth in a boardroom built for comfortable lies. It was a song about a father’s love, a daughter’s memory, a city’s quiet constellations, and in that room, it became a silent, damning indictment of everything on Sofia’s agenda. When the last note faded, the silence it left behind was absolute. It was a silence full of discomfort, of surprise, of an emotion that had no place on a quarterly report. No one moved. No one spoke. They had come for a marketing presentation and had been forced to attend a séance.

Sofia Rey, a master of controlling any room she was in, was the first to recover. The fury at Daniel’s insubordination was a visible, tightly controlled tremor in her jaw. She brought the lights back up with a sharp click of the remote, the harsh, fluorescent glare a welcome return to a world she understood. She fixed Daniel with a look of pure ice. “Thank you, Daniel, for that… interesting artistic detour,” she said, her voice dangerously soft. “A very raw, very personal recording. Perhaps, as we discussed, something for the deluxe edition. Now, if we could please get back to the actual agenda, the tracks with commercial potential?”

Daniel didn’t back down. He stood his ground, his gaze unwavering. “That wasn’t a detour, Sofia,” he said, his voice quiet but resonant in the tense room. “That was the destination. That is the commercial potential. Not because it has a drop or a synth riff, but because it’s real. In a world of fake, real is the most valuable commodity we have. Look around this room. No one was checking their email. No one was looking at a spreadsheet. For two minutes, you were all completely captivated. Isn’t that the goal? Or is the goal just to get on a playlist?” He turned his gaze to the other executives, challenging them directly. “We can release another perfectly polished, formulaic pop album that will be forgotten in six months. Or we can release *this*. We can release a record that matters. The choice is ours.” The open rebellion was now on the table. He had drawn a line in the sand, not between pop and folk, but between commerce and art, and had forced every person in that room to decide which side they were on. The fire had been started, and now the whole room was about to find out if it would provide warmth, or if it would burn the entire project to the ground.The silence in the glass-walled conference room was a weapon. It was no longer the sacred hush that had followed the song, but a tense, strategic vacuum into which Sofia Rey had tried to inject the comfortable drone of corporate procedure. Daniel Vega’s challenge had ripped that comfort away, and now every executive at the polished table was forced to reckon with the raw emotion that had just invaded their world of spreadsheets and projections. Sofia’s icy gaze was fixed on Daniel, a silent command for him to stand down, but Daniel’s focus had shifted to the others, his eyes scanning their faces, waiting for a crack in the corporate armor.

It came from the most unlikely of sources. Not from the young marketing analyst, Lucas, who was now staring at a blank screen on his laptop as if his data had failed him for the first time. It came from Hector Ramirez, the head of A&R. Hector was a man in his late fifties, a veteran who had signed punk bands in the 80s, navigated the grunge explosion of the 90s, and survived the digital decimation of the 2000s. He was a notorious pragmatist, a man who spoke of art in terms of units sold and market share. He cleared his throat, a dry, rustling sound that made everyone turn to him. “Sofia is right,” he began, and Catalina’s heart sank. “From a radio programming perspective, this is a non-starter. It’s too slow, too sad, there’s no hook a seventeen-year-old is going to put on their TikTok.” He paused, letting his pragmatic assessment hang in the air, a clear affirmation of the company line. Sofia’s posture relaxed almost imperceptibly. She had her ally.

“However,” Hector continued, his voice dropping slightly, “I have been doing this for thirty years. And in thirty years, I have learned that there are two kinds of hits. There are the hits you manufacture, and there are the hits you witness. The first kind makes you money. The second kind makes you a legend. The first kind is a product. The second kind is a cultural event.” He leaned forward, his gaze sweeping the room before landing on Catalina. “What that song did in this room, for the last three minutes… that was an event. We can’t measure it. Lucas can’t build an algorithm for it. But every single one of us felt it. My gut, which has made this label a hell of a lot of money over the years, tells me that if we can translate that feeling to a national audience, we are not looking at a single. We are looking at a phenomenon.”

The word ‘phenomenon’ landed on the table with the weight of a gold brick. It was a word that transcended data and spoke the only language the room truly understood: massive, paradigm-shifting profit. Hector had taken Daniel’s artistic rebellion and masterfully reframed it as an unprecedented commercial opportunity. He had built a bridge between the two warring camps. Lucas, the data analyst, looked intrigued for the first time, a new, unquantifiable variable presented to him. The publicist was already mentally sketching out press angles: “The Unplugged Revolution,” “The Sound of Silence.” Sofia Rey was cornered. To argue against Hector’s ‘gut’ was to argue against one of the company’s most consistently profitable assets. She had lost control of the room.

Her retreat was a masterclass in corporate maneuvering. She did not concede defeat. She absorbed the opposition and rebranded it as a bold, experimental strategy. “Hector, your gut is legendary for a reason,” she said, her smile returning, now repurposed to signal visionary leadership. “You and Daniel are making a very passionate case for a high-risk, high-reward approach. I’m not entirely convinced, but I am intrigued. The board, however, will never approve a full album budget based on a gut feeling and a single acoustic demo.” She had found a new obstacle: the faceless, all-powerful board. “So, here is what we will do. We will greenlight a single. One song. Daniel, you will produce it with Catalina, in the spirit of this… raw authenticity. But it cannot be a simple demo. It must be a finished, world-class recording. We will then service it not to radio, but directly to the public through a targeted digital release, backed by a significant social media spend. We will treat it as a test case. If the public response is as phenomenal as your gut suggests, Hector, then we will have the data we need to justify a full album in this direction. If it fails, we pivot back to the original, safer strategy. It is a compromise. It is a smart, data-driven way to test a bold creative theory. Is that agreeable to everyone?”

It was a brilliant gambit. She had turned her loss into a demonstration of her own flexible, innovative leadership. She had given Daniel and Catalina what they wanted, but she had placed it within a framework of immense pressure and scrutiny. They were no longer fighting for a song; they were now responsible for proving a ‘creative theory’ in the unforgiving court of public opinion. A single failure would validate her original position and put them back in her control. Daniel looked at Catalina, a silent question in his eyes. She met his gaze and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. They would take the deal. “Agreeable,” Daniel said, his voice level. The tension in the room dissipated, replaced by the brisk energy of a new, exciting challenge. The meeting was over.

As the executives filed out, their conversation already buzzing with the new strategy, Daniel and Catalina remained behind in the now-empty conference room. The adrenaline of the confrontation slowly ebbed away, leaving a sense of daunting reality in its wake. “Well,” Daniel said, letting out a long, slow breath. “We got what we wanted. Sort of.” He looked at Catalina, his expression serious. “Do you understand what just happened? She gave us enough rope to hang ourselves. We have to deliver a masterpiece, and we have to do it on their terms. The pressure is going to be immense. Every note will be scrutinized. Are you ready for that?”

Catalina thought of Pato’s dusty studio, of the honest voice of the old Martin guitar, of the conversation she had with her father’s ghost. She was no longer the frightened girl who had stood on the finale stage. The battles of the past weeks had forged something new in her, something hard and resilient. “They want a single song that proves the theory,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. “Let’s not give them the lullaby.” Daniel raised an eyebrow, surprised. “That’s our silver bullet.” Catalina shook her head. “No. That’s a secret. That’s for the album. If we are going to fight a war, let’s start with a battle cry.” She reached into her bag and pulled out the folder containing her father’s songs. She leafed past the lullabies and the love songs until she found the one she was looking for. It was a song he had written in his late twenties, a song born of frustration and pride, a fiery malambo about a river that refuses to be dammed, its rhythm the defiant stomping of a gaucho’s boots, its lyrics a proud declaration of identity against a world that wants to change it. “Let’s give them this,” she said, sliding the paper across the polished table to him. “Let’s build a palace out of this stone.” Daniel read the lyrics, a slow, dangerous smile spreading across his face once more. He began to tap out a complex, driving rhythm on the table. The fire was lit, and now they were ready to let it burn.### Chapter 10

The days that followed were an immersion into a world Catalina had only ever glimpsed from the outside. Daniel Vega did not book the sleek, impersonal studio in Palermo. Instead, he made a call, cashed in a favor from his punk-rock past, and secured a different kind of space: a sprawling, high-ceilinged recording room in an old converted warehouse in La Boca, a studio known for its magnificent acoustics and its fierce independence from the mainstream industry. It was a place with history in its walls, the faint scent of river water and spilled wine mingling with the dust on the vintage amplifiers. It was neutral ground, a place where art had a fighting chance against commerce. There, on a vast wooden floor scarred by decades of passionate music-making, they laid out the blueprint for their battle cry.

Catalina’s father’s journal lay open on the massive mixing console, its fragile, yellowed pages a stark contrast to the blinking lights and digital displays. Daniel didn’t treat it like a relic; he treated it like a script. For two days, they did not play a single note. They talked. He had her tell him stories about her father, about the frustration she had seen in his eyes, about the fierce pride he took in his music. He asked her what the river in the song meant to her. “It’s my voice,” she said, the realization dawning on her as she spoke. “It’s my history. It’s everything they think is too old or too sad or too provincial.” And the dam? “The dam is the beautiful palace they want to build,” she answered, “a perfect, modern structure that stops the water from being what it is.” Daniel listened, absorbed, making notes not on a musical staff, but in the margins of a lyric sheet. He was not just arranging a song; he was mapping its soul.

Then he began to assemble his band of revolutionaries. He did not call the A-list session players on the label’s payroll, musicians who could play anything flawlessly and feel nothing. He made calls to men he hadn’t worked with in twenty years. He found Santiago, a legendary percussionist in his late sixties with hands like gnarled roots, a man who was said to be able to make a *bombo legüero*—a traditional Argentinian drum—sound like both a thunderstorm and a human heart. He found a young violinist named Clara, a firecracker who played in a radical tango orchestra, whose bow could weep with the sorrow of a lost love or slash with the anger of a protest. Finally, he brought in a guitarist, an old friend named Javier, a man whose face was a roadmap of hard-lived nights, who understood that the guitar in a *malambo* was not a melodic instrument, but a percussive weapon, a second drum.

Their first day together in the La Boca studio was electric with a tense, uncertain energy. Santiago, Clara, and Javier looked at the young woman from the television, their expressions a mixture of curiosity and professional skepticism. They were artists of the counter-culture, and she was the manufactured product of its opposite. Catalina, in turn, was intimidated by their effortless, world-weary authenticity. Daniel, sensing the divide, let them tune up, let the awkward silence stretch, and then he simply told them the story. He told them about the contract, about the crimson dress, about the fight for the zamba, and about the river that refused to be dammed. He made them understand that this was not a recording session; it was an act of rebellion.

Santiago was the first to respond. He didn’t speak. He simply picked up his mallets and began to play a slow, powerful, ominous rhythm on the *bombo legüero*, a beat that was less a tempo and more a gathering storm. Clara closed her eyes, lifted her violin, and answered the drum with a low, mournful wail that slowly built into a defiant shriek. Javier joined in, his guitar not strumming, but striking, his chords like fists beating against a locked door. The sound they made was raw, visceral, and magnificent. Catalina stood in the vocal booth, watching them, and felt a profound shift inside her. These were not session players. This was her army.

When it was her time to sing, she was no longer the girl with the pure, angelic voice. She was the river. She poured every ounce of her frustration, her defiance, and her fierce, protective love for her family’s legacy into the microphone. She sang of her father’s calloused hands, of her mother’s weary grace, of her abuela’s unshakeable strength. The words on the page were her father’s, but the voice was entirely her own, forged in the fires of the past month. She wasn’t performing; she was testifying. They did four takes, each one more explosive than the last. On the final take, something transcendent happened. The band locked into a groove so deep it felt tectonic. Santiago’s drumming was the earth-shaking stomp of the *malambo* dance, Clara’s violin was a siren’s cry, and Catalina’s voice was a torrent, a force of nature that could not be contained, her final, soaring note a declaration of absolute, unconditional freedom.

The song ended, crashing into a sudden, ringing silence. In the studio, the musicians were breathing hard, sweat beading on their foreheads, looking at each other with the stunned, joyous expressions of people who had just survived something extraordinary together. Catalina sagged against the microphone stand, completely spent, every muscle in her body aching, her throat raw, but her spirit soaring. They all filed into the control room, crowding behind Daniel as he cued up the playback. He didn’t touch the faders. He just hit play. The sound that erupted from the giant studio monitors was colossal. It was a fusion of ancient earth and modern electricity, a sound that was both deeply traditional and fiercely contemporary. It had the rage of a punk rock anthem and the soul of a centuries-old folk song. It was the sound of a revolution.

As her own voice, powerful and undeniable, filled the room, Catalina began to weep. They were not the quiet, sad tears of the Rosedal, but tears of catharsis, of validation, of a profound, painful, and beautiful homecoming. She was hearing not just her father’s song, but her father’s dream, realized in a way he could never have imagined, made manifest through her own fight. Daniel let the track play to the end, then gently faded it out. He turned to look at the small group crowded into his control room. Santiago, the old percussionist, was nodding slowly, a rare, deep smile on his face. Clara’s eyes were shining. Javier simply mouthed the word “Wow.” Daniel looked at Catalina, his own expression one of awe. “Well, kid,” he said, his voice husky. “You wanted to build a palace from his stone. I think we just built a fortress.” The single was no longer a theory. It was a fact. It was a weapon, forged and sharpened, and it was finally ready for war.
