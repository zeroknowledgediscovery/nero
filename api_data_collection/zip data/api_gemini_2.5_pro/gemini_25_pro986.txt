The squeak of the mop bucket’s left wheel was a C sharp. Always a C sharp. Rhys Price knew this with the certainty of a man who’d pushed the same defiant yellow bucket down the same laminated corridors for six years. He could, if he was so inclined, probably conduct a passable symphony using only the sounds of the Gwentfinity Tower after hours. The low, sonorous hum of the server room in A minor. The juddering sigh of the lift arriving at his floor, a G major chord that always resolved a little flat. The percussive *thwump* of a full bin bag hitting the bottom of the service chute, a satisfying bass drum kick. It wasn't music, not really, but it was a rhythm. His rhythm. The soundtrack to a life lived in the quiet hours when the city held its breath.

He was on the executive floor tonight. Floor seventeen. The posh floor. Polished mahogany desks the size of small boats, glass walls that looked out over a sleeping Cardiff. Down below, the headlights of the last few cars painted fleeting golden stripes on the wet tarmac of Bute Street, their reflections shimmering and breaking apart like scattered gold. He paused his work, leaning on the worn handle of his mop, the grey, chemical-scented water sloshing gently against the sides of the bucket. He stared out at the view. From up here, the castle was just a dark lump, the stadium a silent, sleeping bowl. He could see the lights twinkling out towards Penarth, a promise of other lives being lived, of televisions flickering and couples arguing and babies crying. All the noise of the world, and up here, only the C sharp of his wheel and the gentle thrum of the building's own mechanical heart.

Rhys took a breath. Not of the stale, recycled air of the office, but a deeper one, from his diaphragm, the way his Mam had taught him when he was a boy in the chapel choir, his feet dangling high off the pew. The first note came out low and rich, a quiet hum that vibrated through his chest and seemed to warm the cold space around him. It was a fragment of 'Myfanwy', an old song that tasted of rain and longing and damp hillsides. The sound didn't echo much in the heavily carpeted, acoustically deadened space; it was swallowed by the thick pile and the leather chairs almost as soon as it was born. A secret sound for a secret singer. Here, among the empty desks of financial advisors and corporate lawyers, Rhys Price had the best voice in the world. It was a voice that belonged in a grand hall, under a proscenium arch, but it lived here, between the hours of ten p.m. and six a.m., its only audience the uninterested glass and the silent, sleeping computers.

He finished the verse, his voice trailing off into the quiet hum of the building. He felt the familiar pang of it – the joy of the sound, and the ache of its uselessness. A voice like that, his grandfather used to say, was a gift from God. And what was Rhys doing with it? Using it to entertain ghosts in an office block. He shook his head, a small, sad smile touching his lips. Time to get on. The glass partition separating the CEO’s office from the main floor needed polishing. It was a magnet for fingerprints, a weekly battle he always lost.

His phone, a cheap thing with a spiderweb of cracks across the screen, vibrated violently against the metal of his cleaning trolley, its buzzing loud and intrusive in the silence. It was a private number. Usually a scam call about an accident he’d never had, or someone trying to sell him insulation. He nearly ignored it, letting it buzz itself to death while he hunted for the glass cleaner. But something, a flicker of… what? Not hope. Just curiosity, maybe. It made him wipe his damp hands on the thighs of his grey overalls and pluck the phone from its nest of spare bin liners.

"Hello?" His voice was tentative, the voice he used for strangers and officials.

A voice, sharp and fast and sounding like it was being spoken in a wind tunnel of pure, undiluted importance, clipped back at him. "Is this Rhys Price?" A woman. A London accent, the kind you heard on the telly, where all the vowels were ironed out.

"Yes?" he said, his own Welsh lilt suddenly feeling thick and clumsy in his mouth. "Speaking."

"Rhys, it's Chloe from 'Britain's Got The Voice'. We have some news about the final."

Rhys Price’s world, which had been moving to the slow, predictable rhythm of mop, bucket, and bin, suddenly stopped. The C sharp wheel, the humming servers, the distant traffic – it all vanished. His heart, which usually beat a steady, reliable tempo, did a strange little stutter-step against his ribs, like a drum machine falling down a flight of stairs. The mop handle slipped from his suddenly nerveless grasp and clattered against the fake-marble floor. He felt the blood drain from his face, then rush back with the force of a tidal bore up the Severn, making his ears roar. ‘Britain’s Got The Voice’. The biggest talent show on television. He’d done the audition on a whim, egged on relentlessly by his sister, Cerys. She’d filmed him on her phone, a blurry video of him standing in his living room, belting out a Tom Jones number with the dog barking in the background. They’d sent it off with no expectation, none at all, a silly joke, a lottery ticket bought for a laugh. They'd called him for a preliminary audition in Bristol a few months back. He'd sung, they'd nodded politely, and he'd gone home on the Megabus, convinced that was the end of it.

"The… the final?" he whispered, the words catching in his throat. He sounded like a fool.

"That's right," Chloe from London said, her voice betraying not a flicker of the earth-shattering importance of her message. It was just another phone call for her. For Rhys, it was the sound of a new universe being born. "One of our finalists has had to withdraw due to… well, due to a personal issue with a llama. It's a long story. Point is, there's a space. The judges reviewed the wildcard list this afternoon. They loved you, Rhys. Your video, your audition. They loved the authenticity. That's the word Simon used. 'Authentic.' And 'raw.' You're in. The final is this Saturday. In London."

London. Saturday. The final. The words floated in the air in front of him, shimmering and unreal, like the city lights in the rain-streaked glass. He was in. He, Rhys Price, the cleaner from Splott, was going to be on the telly. On the final. In front of millions of people. A giddy, terrifying wave of pure, unadulterated joy washed over him, so potent it made him dizzy. He gripped the edge of his trolley to steady himself, a huge, goofy grin spreading across his face.

"Are you still there, Rhys?" Chloe asked, a hint of impatience in her tone.

"Yes! Yes, I'm here! Sorry, I just… wow. Just, wow."

"Great. We'll need you at the Fountain Studios in Wembley by ten a.m. Saturday for rehearsals. A car will pick you up from your hotel. We'll email you all the details – hotel confirmation, schedules, song choices. We've got you down for 'Delilah', is that still okay?"

"Okay? It’s… it's brilliant. It's… thank you. Thank you so much."

"No problem, Rhys. Congratulations. Don't be late." And then she was gone. The line went dead, leaving only the faint hiss of empty space.

Rhys stared at his phone, then at the view, then at his own reflection in the gleaming glass partition. A man in grey overalls, his hair slightly askew, his face split by a grin so wide it felt like it might crack his jaw. He let out a whoop of laughter, a sound so loud and full of life it seemed to startle the sleeping building. The sound echoed this time, bouncing off the glass and the mahogany, filling the corporate silence with pure, unbottled happiness. He did a little shuffling dance, his heavy work boots clumsy on the polished floor. He was in. He was bloody in!

The first person he had to tell was his Mam. His shift didn't end for another four hours, but there was no way he could wait. He fumbled in his pocket for a coin for the vending machine – his mobile tariff was pay-as-you-go and famously unreliable for anything more than a two-minute conversation. He practically ran to the lift, his heart hammering a triumphant rhythm against his ribs. He jabbed the button for the ground floor, and as the lift began its smooth, juddering descent, he watched the floors count down, each number a step closer to telling her, to making the impossible news real by sharing it.

He found a quiet corner in the deserted lobby, the phone receiver cold against his ear. It rang twice before she picked up.

"Hello?" Her voice was sleepy, but instantly familiar, warm and soft as a worn blanket.

"Mam? It's me. I'm sorry for waking you."

"Rhys, bach, what's wrong? Are you alright?" Instant concern. That was his Mam all over.

"I'm more than alright, Mam." He was grinning again, unable to stop. "I have some news. Some really, really big news. Are you sitting down?"

"I'm lying down, you daft thing, it's two in the morning. What is it? You haven't been sacked, have you?"

"No! No, the opposite. The total opposite." He took a deep breath, savouring the moment. "Mam… I'm in. The final. 'Britain's Got The Voice'. They just phoned me. I'm in the final!"

There was a moment of complete silence on the other end of the line. Rhys held his breath. He could picture her in her small terraced house in Tonypandy, the flowery wallpaper, the framed photos of him and Cerys on the mantelpiece. He could imagine the look on her face.

Then, a shriek. "NEVER! Rhys, are you joking with me? If you're joking I'll skin you."

"I'm not joking, Mam! I swear on Grandad's grave. A woman called Chloe from London. One of the other finalists had a problem with a… a llama or something. It doesn't matter. They picked me. From the wildcard list. I've got to be in London on Saturday."

He could hear her starting to cry, not sad tears, but huge, gulping, joyful sobs. "Oh, Rhys! Oh, my boy! I knew it! I always said you had the voice of an angel. An absolute angel. I told everyone. I told Mrs Hughes next door, I told them down the bingo. 'My Rhys,' I said, 'he's got a gift.' And now everyone will see! Oh, I'm so proud of you, love. So, so proud."

Her pride washed over him, warmer than any spotlight. This was why he did it. This was who he sang for. Not for the money, not even for the fame, but for this. For the sound of his mother's voice, thick with tears of happiness.

"They're putting me in a hotel, Mam. A hotel in London."

"A hotel! Get you! Like Tom Jones himself. Oh, we have to tell Cerys. And your Auntie Val. The whole valley will be watching! We'll have a party. A massive party. Rhys Price, on the telly!"

They talked for another twenty minutes, her excitement a fizzing, infectious energy that travelled down the phone line and lit him up from the inside. He promised to call her as soon as he got the email with the details. When he finally hung up, the lobby of the Gwentfinity Tower felt less like a workplace and more like the anteroom to heaven. He couldn't go back to cleaning. Not now. He felt like a king. The C sharp wheel of his bucket, the smell of bleach, the endless corridors – they belonged to another man, a different Rhys Price who existed in a black and white world. His world was now in glorious, vibrant Technicolor.

He all but floated back up to the seventeenth floor. The rest of his shift passed in a blur of daydreams. He saw himself on the stage, the lights hot on his face, the roar of the crowd. He saw Simon Cowell's face, a mixture of shock and admiration. He saw the headlines: "The Crooning Cleaner from Cardiff!" He polished the CEO's glass partition with a flourish, seeing his own triumphant face reflected back at him. He hummed 'Delilah' under his breath, the song feeling new and powerful, a weapon he was about to unleash on the world.

At six a.m., as the first hint of a grey dawn began to silhouette the buildings outside, he clocked out and walked out of the tower into the cool morning air. The city was waking up, the first buses rumbling past, the smell of baking bread drifting from a nearby cafe. Everything looked different. Sharper. More full of promise. He felt a kinship with the waking city, as if he too were just starting a new day, a new life. He didn't feel tired. He felt electric.

He got back to his small flat in Splott, the joy still bubbling inside him. The email was there. 'BGTF Finalist Information'. His fingers trembled as he clicked it open. There it was, in black and white. His name. The hotel booking confirmation. The rehearsal schedule. The address of the studio in Wembley. It was real. It was all real. He sat back in his worn-out computer chair, the springs groaning in protest, and let the reality of it sink in. Saturday. In three days, his life could change forever. He pulled up the National Rail website, a wide, optimistic smile still on his face. Cardiff Central to London Paddington. He typed in the details, imagining the journey, the train pulling out of the station, leaving his old life behind on the platform.

The results loaded. A list of train times and prices appeared on the screen. His smile faltered. Then it vanished completely, replaced by a cold, sinking dread that started in his stomach and spread through his entire body. Single journey. Off-peak. Even with the cheapest, most awkward connection, the price staring back at him was a three-figure number. A number that was significantly larger than the one currently sitting in his bank account. He clicked on the return journey, hoping for a miracle. The price doubled. The joy that had filled him up just moments before drained away, leaving a hollow, echoing void. London. The final. The roar of the crowd. It was all there, waiting for him. But there was a dragon at the gate, a toll to be paid. And Rhys Price, the Crooning Cleaner with the voice of an angel, didn't have the fare.The numbers on the screen didn't move. They just sat there, stark and unforgiving in the cheap glow of his monitor. £128.50. That was for a single ticket, travelling at a time that would get him to Wembley with barely an hour to spare. The return was even more ludicrous. He clicked back to his online banking tab, a pathetic little window open next to the National Rail website. Balance: £42.17. That had to last him until his next payday, a full week away. It was supposed to cover his food, his electricity key, his bus pass. It certainly didn't cover a return trip to a dream.

The silence in his small flat was suddenly oppressive. The joy, that vibrant, Technicolor feeling, had been snuffed out as quickly as a candle in a gale. In its place was a familiar, heavy weight. The weight of being skint. The weight of always being one broken boiler or one unexpected bill away from disaster. This time, the unexpected bill was a ticket to a new life, and the irony of it was so bitter it made him want to laugh, or be sick. He could have a voice that moved judges to tears, a gift from God as his Grandad had said, but it was worthless if he couldn't afford the 150-mile train journey to use it. The Gwentfinity Tower seemed a million miles away now, a glass castle in a fairytale he'd only been visiting. He was back in his real world, a world of cracked linoleum and a bank balance that mocked his ambitions.

He buried his face in his hands, the rough texture of his calloused palms scraping against his stubble. What could he do? The thought of calling his Mam and telling her was unbearable. Her soaring pride would come crashing down, and the disappointment in her voice would break his heart. He couldn't do that to her. He could ask Cerys, but he knew she was just as strapped as he was, juggling a part-time job at the bakery with trying to raise her little boy, Cai. Pride, hot and stubborn, rose in his chest. He was the older brother. He was supposed to be the one helping her out, not coming cap in hand because he couldn’t afford a train ticket.

He scrolled frantically through the National Rail website again, as if staring at it long enough would magically make a new, cheaper option appear. He looked at bus times. The Megabus. The journey would take over four hours, he’d have to leave in the middle of the night and he’d arrive in London exhausted, smelling of recycled air and service station coffee. He looked up the price. £25 each way. Fifty pounds. Still more than the £42.17 sitting in his account. It might as well have been a million. The hope flickered and died again. He felt trapped, pathetic. A great singer who was going to be defeated by a bus fare. "The Crooning Cleaner from Cardiff!" The imagined headline now seemed like a cruel joke. It would be a shorter, more pathetic story: "Local Man Misses Shot at Stardom, Couldn't Afford the Bus."

He pushed himself away from the desk, pacing the small strip of carpet between his sofa and the kitchenette. His gaze fell on his grandfather's guitar, leaning in the corner. It wasn't worth much to anyone but him. Then he saw it, on the small shelf above his TV – a silver-plated pocket watch on a tarnished chain. It had been his Grandad's, given to him for 40 years of service down the pit. It didn't work anymore, but it was his most treasured possession. The thought of taking it to a pawn shop made a cold knot of shame tighten in his gut. What would his Grandad think? *'A gift from God, boyo,'* he could almost hear the old man's gravelly voice. A gift he was about to squander. But what was the alternative? To sit here and let the opportunity of a lifetime slip through his fingers? He picked up the watch, its weight cool and solid in his palm. The engraving on the back was worn smooth: *'For David Price. 40 Years. NCB.'* He couldn't. He just couldn't.

Defeated, he slumped onto the sofa and finally did the thing he'd been avoiding. He dialled Cerys's number. She answered on the second ring, her voice bright and breathless. "Rhys! I've been waiting for you to call! Mam rang me, I can't believe it! I'm telling everyone, I've already put it on Facebook! 'My big brother is in the final!' I'm so proud I could burst! Are you buzzing? You must be absolutely buzzing!"

Her excitement was a physical blow, each cheerful word a reminder of the chasm between her expectations and his reality. He tried to match her tone, but his voice came out flat and dead. "Yeah. Yeah, Cerys, it's… it's mad, isn't it?"

The fizz on the other end of the line immediately went flat. Cerys knew him better than anyone. She could read his silences, interpret his pauses. "What's wrong?" she asked, her voice instantly changing from celebratory to sharp, diagnostic. "You sound like you've just been told the dog's died. What's happened?"

"Nothing! Nothing's wrong," he lied, poorly. "I'm just tired. It's been a long night."

"Don't you 'nothing' me, Rhys Price. I know that voice. That's your 'I've broken one of Mam's good plates' voice. Spit it out. Now."

He sighed, the air leaving his lungs in a long, rattling hiss. There was no point pretending with Cerys. "I can't go."

"What do you mean you can't go? Don't be stupid. They've put you in the final. Of course you can go."

"No, Cerys, I mean I *can't go*. I can't get there. The train fare… it's over a hundred quid. Even the bus is fifty. I've got forty-two pounds to my name. It's not enough." The words came out in a rush of shame, and admitting it out loud made the problem feel even more solid and insurmountable.

There was a moment of stunned silence from her end. Then, not sympathy, but pure, undiluted fury. "You are kidding me," she said, her voice dangerously low. "You are not telling me that after all this, after all those years of you singing into a mop handle, you're going to let a train fare stop you? No. Absolutely not. I forbid it."

"It's not that simple!" he protested, his own frustration rising. "What do you want me to do? Magic the money out of thin air? Rob a bank?"

"Don't be a bloody idiot," she snapped back, all business now. "Right. Listen to me. You are going to London. End of story. I'll figure it out. How much do you need, exactly? For the bus."

"Fifty quid for the return," he mumbled, feeling about twelve years old. "Plus a bit to eat, I suppose."

"Okay. Seventy. Leave it with me. You just focus on the singing. Practise 'Delilah' until the neighbours complain. I'll call you back." Before he could argue, before he could tell her not to put herself out, she'd hung up. Rhys stared at the phone, a strange mixture of relief and emasculation washing over him. His little sister, once again, was coming to his rescue. He hated it. And he was profoundly, desperately grateful for it. He sank back into the sofa, the pocket watch still clutched in his hand, and waited.True to her word, Cerys was a whirlwind. Her first port of call was the bakery where she worked, the scent of warm bread and icing sugar a sharp contrast to the acidic panic in her veins. Her boss, Megan, a woman with flour permanently dusted in her hairline and a heart as soft as a fresh-iced bun, was just pulling a tray of Welsh cakes from the griddle. Cerys didn't even wait for her to put them down.

"Megan, I need a favour. A massive one. It's Rhys," she said, her words tumbling out in a rush. "He's in the final. 'Britain's Got The Voice'. This Saturday. In London. And the daft git can't afford the bus fare."

Megan froze, the tray of cakes held aloft. Her eyes, magnified by her thick glasses, widened. "Our Rhys? In the final? Get out of here!" she exclaimed, a huge smile breaking across her face. "Well, we can't have that, can we? A Valleys boy missing his shot because of Great Western Railway? Not on my watch." She placed the tray down with a decisive clatter, wiped her hands on her apron, and marched to the till. She pulled it open with a jingle and took out a crisp twenty-pound note, folding it into Cerys’s hand. "There. That's a start. And take this." She grabbed an empty, round biscuit tin from under the counter, the picture on the lid a faded, nostalgic scene of a Highland cow. "Put a sign on it. People will want to help. My God, Rhys Price on the telly. I always knew that boy had something special."

Armed with a biscuit tin, a twenty-pound note, and a ferocious sense of purpose, Cerys became a one-woman fundraising machine. She scribbled 'RHYS TO LONDON! FINAL!' on a piece of cardboard and taped it to the tin. She accosted customers buying their morning loaf, cornered the postman, and flagged down the window cleaner. The news spread like wildfire through the tight-knit streets. It was no longer just Rhys's business; it was a matter of local pride. The story grew with each telling, gaining embellishments and dramatic flourishes until Rhys was practically a national hero already, a working-class champion about to take on the world, if only they could get him to Paddington. Coins clattered into the tin. A fiver was tucked in by Dai from the bookies, who said he'd open a book on Rhys winning it all. Mrs Hughes from next door to their Mam’s house came out in her dressing gown, pressing two crumpled ten-pound notes into Cerys’s hand and declaring she’d be organising a street party.

Back in his flat in Splott, Rhys was adrift in a sea of anxious waiting. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't sit still. The shame of his helplessness warred with the desperate hope that Cerys would succeed. He paced his small living room, the Grandad's pocket watch now sitting on the arm of the sofa, a silent, silver accusation. Cerys’s words echoed in his head: 'Practise 'Delilah' until the neighbours complain.' He picked up his guitar, but his fingers felt clumsy and stupid on the frets. He tried to sing, but the note that came out was thin and reedy, strangled by self-doubt. He was a fraud. A cleaner with a silly dream who couldn't even manage his own life.

He put the guitar down and walked to the window, looking out over the grey slate roofs of his neighbourhood. This was his world. A world of paying the meter, of cheap food, of making do. The world of London, of television studios and celebrity judges, felt like another planet, one he had no right to visit. He saw his own reflection in the glass: a tired-looking man with worry etched around his eyes. He thought of his Mam’s joyful sobs, of Megan the baker’s generosity, of Dai the bookie offering odds on him. They believed in him. All these people, chipping in their spare change, were buying him a ticket. Not just for a bus, but a ticket to try. Their belief was a weight, but it was also a foundation. He couldn't let them down. Not because of pride, not anymore. But because of them.

He took a deep breath, from his diaphragm, the way his Mam had taught him. He closed his eyes, shutting out the cracked linoleum and the peeling paint of his flat. He pictured the stage. He pictured the lights. He didn't think about Simon Cowell or the millions watching. He thought about Mrs Hughes in her dressing gown. He thought of Cerys, fighting his corner. He thought of his Mam, her face glowing with pride. He opened his mouth and this time, the voice that came out was different. It was the voice from the seventeenth floor. Rich, powerful, and full of a longing that went deeper than just a song. "I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window," he sang, the notes filling the small room, vibrating through the floorboards, pushing back against the drab reality of his surroundings. He sang with everything he had, the story of betrayal and desperate love in the song merging with his own desperate hope. He sang the final, explosive "My, my, my, Delilah!" with a force that made the window pane rattle, a raw, primal roar of defiance.

The silence that followed was absolute. He stood, breathing heavily, his heart pounding. The shame had been burned away by the heat of the song, replaced by a clear, sharp resolve. He was a singer. This is what he did. It was the one thing in his life he was truly good at. A sharp rap on his front door made him jump. He opened it to find his downstairs neighbour, Mr. Evans, a retired docker with a face like a crumpled map of South Wales. Rhys braced himself for a complaint.

"Everything alright, boyo?" Mr. Evans asked, his head cocked to one side.

"Fine, Mr. Evans. Sorry if I was a bit loud," Rhys said, sheepishly.

The old man grinned, revealing a startling lack of teeth. "Loud? It was bloody marvellous! Gave me goosebumps. My missus is in there crying, says it’s better than the man himself. You keep that up, son. You keep that up." He gave Rhys a thumbs-up and shuffled back to his own flat. Rhys closed the door, a slow smile spreading across his face. He felt ten feet tall.

Just then, his phone rang. It was Cerys. He answered, his voice steady now. "Well?"

"You're in business, big brother," she said, and he could hear the triumphant grin in her voice. "I've got ninety-five quid for you. The whole valley's practically chipped in. I've just transferred it. It should be in your account right now. You're not just singing for yourself anymore, Rhys. You're singing for all of us. Don't you dare mess it up."

"I won't," he said, and the words felt like a vow. "Cerys… thank you."

"Don't thank me. Thank Megan and Dai and Mrs Hughes and about thirty other people. Now go and book that bus ticket before you spend it all on crisps. And Rhys? I love you. Knock 'em dead."

He hung up and immediately logged back onto the bus website. He looked at his bank account first. Balance: £137.17. It was the most beautiful number he had ever seen. He navigated to the booking page, his fingers flying across the keyboard. He didn't book the cheapest, most awkward ticket. He booked the one that would get him there in plenty of time, with a seat reservation. He even added the extra pound for travel insurance. He clicked 'Confirm Purchase'. The screen refreshed, displaying a booking reference and a QR code. It was done. It was real. The relief was so profound it almost buckled his knees. He leaned back in his chair, the flimsy piece of office furniture groaning under the weight of his impossible, incredible, community-funded dream. He was going to London. He was going to the final.The two days before he left were a strange, feverish dream. Rhys barely slept, his mind a frantic reel of song lyrics, bus timetables, and the imagined faces of millions of television viewers. He went to work on Thursday and Friday night, pushing his mop bucket with its C sharp wheel down the familiar corridors of the Gwentfinity Tower, but he felt like a ghost haunting his own life. The building’s familiar symphony—the A minor hum of the servers, the flat G major chord of the lift—now sounded like a farewell tour. He polished the glass and emptied the bins with a meticulousness born of nervous energy, his body on autopilot while his soul was already halfway to London, rehearsing on a stage made of starlight and terror. Every reflective surface showed him a man on the edge of something, a stranger wearing his own face, his eyes wide with a terrifying, brilliant hope.

Saturday morning arrived with a pale, watery sunrise that did little to warm the pre-dawn chill. Rhys locked the door to his flat, the click of the latch echoing with a profound finality. He had a small, battered rucksack on his back containing a clean shirt, his toothbrush, and the suit he’d worn to his grandfather's funeral, the only one he owned. On his phone, nestled amongst the spiderweb cracks, was the QR code for his bus ticket, the most precious and improbable digital file he had ever possessed. The streets of Splott were hushed and still as he walked to the bus station, the air tasting of damp pavement and anticipation. He felt the ninety-five pounds from the biscuit tin sitting in his bank account not as money, but as a tangible weight of belief from his community, a collective shove in the back pushing him forward.

The bus station was a hub of quiet, predawn journeys. He found his seat on the double-decker, a window seat on the upper deck, and watched as the other passengers filed on: students with oversized headphones, a young family trying to keep a toddler from a full-blown meltdown, an elderly couple sharing a flask of tea. They were all just people going somewhere. For them, it was just a bus journey. For Rhys, it was an exodus. As the bus hissed and pulled away from the curb, he watched Cardiff shrink behind him. He saw the top of the Gwentfinity Tower, a dark spire against the brightening sky, and felt a strange pang of affection for its soulless, silent floors. It had been his secret stage for so long, the place where his voice had been kept safe. Now, he was leaving it behind, taking his secret out into the blinding light.

The monotonous drone of the M4 motorway became the soundtrack to his anxiety. He watched the green hills of Wales flatten into the rolling fields of England, each mile taking him further from everything he knew. The giddy joy of the phone call had long since evaporated, replaced by a cold, creeping dread. What if he wasn't good enough? What if the judges had made a mistake? The word Simon had used, 'authentic', now sounded like a polite way of saying 'amateur'. He imagined himself on stage, his cheap suit feeling like a costume, his voice cracking under the pressure. The thought made his stomach churn. He pulled out his cheap earbuds, plugged them into his phone, and put 'Delilah' on a loop. He didn't listen to Tom Jones's version. He listened to the silence between the plays, trying to hear his own voice, to find the power he’d felt in his living room, the power Mr. Evans had called ‘marvellous’. He sang it silently to himself, over and over, his lips barely moving, a desperate mantra against the rising tide of fear.

Arriving at Victoria Coach Station was like being dropped into a hornet’s nest. The sheer volume of people, the cacophony of languages, the relentless motion and noise hit Rhys like a physical blow. He stood frozen for a moment just inside the terminal, clutching his rucksack, a tiny, bewildered island in a river of rushing humanity. The scale of it was suffocating. Cardiff was a city, but this was something else entirely—a sprawling, indifferent beast. For the first time, he felt truly alone, a boy from the Valleys completely out of his depth. The confidence he’d managed to build on the bus journey crumbled, leaving him feeling small, provincial, and foolishly out of place. His Welsh accent, which he’d never thought twice about, suddenly felt thick and conspicuous in his head.

Following the instructions in the email, he navigated the bewildering signs for the Underground, his heart thumping a nervous rhythm against his ribs. He fumbled with the ticket machine, convinced everyone in the queue behind him was sighing with impatience at the clumsy tourist. The descent on the escalator felt like a journey into the earth’s core, leading him to a platform roaring with noise and wind. He squeezed onto a packed tube train, forced into an uncomfortable intimacy with strangers who stared blankly at their phones, masters of the urban art of ignoring one another. He felt a desperate urge to get back on the bus and go home, back to the C sharp wheel and the quiet hum of the server room, back to a world he understood.

The hotel was a sleek, glass-fronted building a short walk from the tube station, dwarfed by the magnificent, arching sweep of Wembley Stadium next to it. The stadium was real. It wasn't just a picture on the telly. The sight of it, so vast and imposing, sent a fresh jolt of terror and awe through him. At the reception desk, he gave his name, half-expecting them to have no record of him, for it all to be a cruel joke. But the receptionist smiled brightly. "Ah yes, Mr. Price. For 'Britain's Got The Voice'. Welcome. We have you on the tenth floor." The ease of it, the professional welcome, was both reassuring and terrifyingly official. This was happening. He took the keycard, his hand trembling slightly, and rode the silent, carpeted lift up to his room.

The room was bigger than his entire living room. It had a bed with a mountain of crisp white pillows, a gleaming bathroom with a row of tiny, expensive-smelling bottles, and a flat-screen TV the size of a small window. It was the fanciest place he had ever been in his life, and he felt like an imposter who had snuck in with the laundry. He walked over to the window and looked out. There was no view of sleeping Cardiff, no comforting dark lump of the castle. Instead, there was the iconic Wembley Arch, so close he felt he could almost touch it. It dominated the view, a silent, monumental promise of what was at stake. This was the view of a winner, a star. He was just Rhys the cleaner, and the dizzying height, the sheer unlikeliness of him being there, made his head spin.

He sank onto the edge of the ridiculously comfortable bed and pulled out his phone. He had to call his Mam. Hearing her voice, sleepy and warm, was like finding an anchor in a storm. "Rhys, bach! Are you there? Are you in the posh hotel?" Cerys was on speakerphone too, her voice fizzing with excitement. "What's it like? Is it massive? Have you seen any celebrities? Did Simon Cowell send you champagne?" He described the room, the view, the tiny soaps, and they squealed with delight at every detail. Their belief in him was so pure, so absolute, it felt like a force field. They weren't worried. They were certain. "We're having the party here," his Mam said, her voice thick with emotion. "The whole street's coming. We've got flags. We're so proud of you, Rhys. Just sing your heart out, love. That's all you have to do." After he hung up, Rhys stood and looked back out the window at the arch. The fear was still there, a cold knot in his stomach. But now, it had a purpose. He wasn't just singing for himself. He was singing for his Mam, for Cerys, for Megan the baker and Dai the bookie and Mr. Evans and a whole valley full of people who had bought him this ticket. He took a deep breath, from his diaphragm. He was ready for rehearsal.Walking from the hushed, air-conditioned luxury of the hotel into the chaotic reality of Wembley felt like stepping through a portal. The sheer scale of the stadium and its surrounding complex was dizzying, a concrete and steel testament to ambition. Rhys clutched the strap of his rucksack, his knuckles white, feeling like a very small, very Welsh boat cast into a turbulent ocean. He found the entrance to Fountain Studios tucked away, an unassuming door that gave no hint of the frantic world-building happening within. The moment he stepped over the threshold, he was hit by a wall of purposeful noise. People with lanyards and headsets strode past him with an urgency that made his own tentative steps feel clumsy. Miles of thick black cable snaked across the floor like slumbering pythons, and the air hummed with the electric potential of a thousand moving parts all gearing up for a single purpose: the show.

He spotted her by a bank of monitors, a clipboard in one hand and a furiously buzzing phone in the other. It was Chloe, the woman with the ironed-out vowels. She looked even more intense and important in person, her face a mask of concentration. He approached her cautiously, as if approaching a wild animal. "Excuse me? Chloe? It's Rhys Price." She glanced up, her eyes flicking over him in a rapid, professional assessment. There was no recognition, no warmth. Just a quick mental check of a box. "Rhys. Good. You're here," she said, her tone as clipped as it had been on the phone. "We're running behind. We'll get you a soundcheck in about twenty minutes. Go and wait in the green room, it's down that corridor. Don't wander off." She turned back to her phone before he could even form a response, his presence already forgotten. He was no longer a wildcard miracle; he was just another item on a very long to-do list.

The green room was a brightly lit space filled with modular sofas and a table laden with pastries and fruit he was too nervous to touch. This was where he first saw them, the other finalists. They were a flock of exotic, confident birds, and he was a bewildered pigeon that had stumbled into their aviary. There was a girl band, all impossibly long legs and synchronised glittery eyeshadow, practising harmonies in a tight huddle. A young magician with slicked-back hair was making a coin disappear and reappear to the delight of a fresh-faced teenage singer-songwriter with a guitar case covered in stickers. They all seemed to know each other, bonded by weeks of shared experiences, inside jokes, and the communal pressure cooker of the competition. They glanced at him as he entered, a collective flicker of curiosity that quickly subsided into polite indifference. He was the replacement, the interloper who had taken the place of the llama-botherer. He found an empty corner of a sofa, sat down, and felt the chasm between their world and his widen into an unbridgeable canyon.

A harassed-looking runner with a headset eventually called his name. "Rhys Price! You're up. Stage right." The runner led him through a labyrinth of darkened corridors, the noise growing louder and more intense until they emerged into the wings of the main studio. The sight that greeted him stopped him dead. The stage was a universe of light and darkness. A forest of lighting rigs hung from the ceiling like metallic stalactites, casting pools of intense white light onto the polished black floor. Beyond the lip of the stage, the vast, empty auditorium gaped like the maw of some great beast, row after row of vacant red seats waiting to be filled with thousands of expectant faces. And there, at the centre of it all, were the three famous judges’ chairs, empty and iconic under the glare. It felt less like a television studio and more like a sacrificial altar, and he was the next offering.

He walked to the centre of the stage, the heat from the lights prickling his skin. His work boots felt absurdly heavy and clumsy on the gleaming floor. A man with a weary face and a T-shirt that was a size too small looked up from a music stand. "Rhys, is it? I'm Frank, the MD. 'Delilah', yeah?" Rhys just nodded, his throat suddenly as dry as dust. "Okay, lads," Frank called out to the unseen band. "Let's have a run-through. Nice and easy." The familiar opening chords struck up, but they sounded alien and intimidating coming from the powerful, professional band. Rhys opened his mouth to sing, but the voice that came out was thin and shaky, a pale imitation of his own. He was tight with nerves, every muscle in his body clenched. He could feel the disinterest from the crew around him; they were checking light levels, talking into their headsets, their attention already elsewhere. He stumbled through the first verse and chorus, his voice passionless, his heart a frantic, panicked bird beating against his ribs.

Frank waved his hand, and the music shuddered to a halt. "Okay, Rhys, right," he said, his tone not unkind but brutally direct. "We're going to need a bit more than that. It's the final. It's a big song. It needs... well, it needs balls, frankly. That was a bit polite, a bit church hall. This audience, they'll eat you alive if you give them that." The words, spoken plainly in the vast, echoing studio, were a public confirmation of his deepest fear: he didn't belong here. He could feel the pitying glances of the crew members who were paying attention, the imagined smirks of the other contestants watching from the wings. The shame was a physical heat, flushing his neck and face, and for a horrible, sinking moment, he wanted the floor to swallow him whole.

But then, something else rose up to meet the shame. It was a stubborn, familiar grit, forged in the quiet defiance of his nightly work and the unshakeable pride of his heritage. He wasn't some delicate flower. He was the grandson of a coal miner, a man who had faced the dark every single day. He thought of Cerys, fighting for him in the bakery. He thought of the biscuit tin, heavy with the fivers and pound coins of his neighbours. He thought of his Mam's voice, brimming with a faith he couldn't find in himself. *'Just sing your heart out, love.'* He wasn't just Rhys Price, the cleaner. He was Rhys Price from the Rhondda Valley, and he was carrying all of them with him onto this stage. He took a breath, a real one, deep from his diaphragm, and straightened his shoulders. "Can I go again?" he asked, his voice quiet but clear and steady. "From the top, please."

Frank looked at him, a flicker of surprise in his weary eyes, then gave a curt shrug. "Your time, mate. Go for it." The band kicked in once more. This time, Rhys closed his eyes for a second, shutting out the intimidating lights, the cameras, the vast emptiness. He wasn't in Wembley. He was back on the seventeenth floor of the Gwentfinity Tower, the city of Cardiff a glittering carpet at his feet, with only the ghosts of the corporate world for an audience. He wasn't singing for Simon Cowell. He was singing for his Mam, for Cerys, for Mr. Evans downstairs. He let the story of the song take hold of him, not just the lyrics, but the raw, desperate passion behind them. The voice that came out this time was not polite. It was a force of nature, torn from somewhere deep inside him. It was full of longing and loss and a furious, wild hope. It was the sound of a man who had nothing left to lose.

He powered through the song, his voice soaring, filling every corner of the cavernous studio. He wasn't just performing; he was testifying. When he reached the final, explosive crescendo, the repeated, desperate cry of "My, my, my, Delilah!", it was not a note, but a roar, a release of every fear, every doubt, every ounce of hope he possessed. As the final chord hung in the air and then faded into an electric silence, Rhys stood, chest heaving, his eyes still closed. When he opened them, the scene had changed. A few of the crew had stopped working and were just staring at him. From the wings, the teenage singer-songwriter was watching him with wide, astonished eyes. Chloe had actually lowered her clipboard. Frank, the musical director, gazed at him for a long, silent moment, his head tilted. Then, a slow, almost imperceptible nod. "Yeah," he said, his voice low. "Okay. That'll do." It was the most glorious praise Rhys had ever received. He walked off the stage on legs that felt like jelly, but his heart was a steady, powerful drum. The fear hadn't vanished, but it had a new companion. He had found his voice. He belonged.When Rhys walked back into the green room, the atmosphere had subtly, yet undeniably, shifted. The low chatter of the girl band faltered as he entered, their curious glances now tinged with something new – respect, and perhaps a sliver of apprehension. The young magician, who had previously looked straight through him, caught his eye and gave a slow, deliberate nod. It was the teenage singer-songwriter, a kid named Leo with a guitar case that looked like a well-travelled passport, who broke the silence. He uncurled himself from his sofa and approached Rhys, his expression one of genuine awe.

"Mate, that was… something else," Leo said, his voice quiet. "During the first run-through, I thought… well, you know. But that second time. Where did *that* come from?"

Rhys, who had spent his adult life being professionally invisible, was utterly unequipped for praise from a peer. He felt a blush creep up his neck. "I don't know," he mumbled, which was the honest truth. "Just... thought of home." The answer seemed to satisfy Leo, who nodded again, as if Rhys had shared a profound secret of the craft. Rhys retreated back to his corner of the sofa, but he no longer felt like an interloper. He was still the odd one out, the quiet man in work clothes amongst a flock of glittering performers, but his presence now had weight. He had earned his place at the table, not with a sob story or a gimmick, but with the one thing that was undeniably his: his voice.

The hours that followed were a surreal montage of organised chaos. A stylist named Portia, a whirlwind of fuschia hair and kinetic energy, descended upon him. "Rhys, darling! The wildcard! Thrilled to have you. Now, let's get you out of this… industrial chic," she said, eyeing his grey overalls with a theatrical shudder. He was led to a cavernous wardrobe department, a glittering Aladdin's cave of sequins, leather, and designer labels. Portia held up a tight-fitting velvet jacket and a pair of jeans so distressed they looked like they had been in a fight with a lawnmower. "Edgy. Brooding. The sensitive brute. It's perfect."

Rhys looked at the proposed outfit, then at the crumpled carrier bag in his hand. Inside was his grandfather’s suit. It was heavy, dark wool, double-breasted and hopelessly out of fashion, but it was beautifully made, and it smelled faintly of cedar and time. It was the suit of a respectable man, a man who had worked hard his whole life and earned the right to stand tall. A stubbornness he hadn't known he possessed rose in him. "No, thank you," he said, his voice quiet but firm. "I'm wearing my own suit." He pulled it from the bag. Portia’s face fell. "Oh, honey. No. That's… very sweet. Very… vintage. But this is primetime television, not a christening in 1982." But Rhys held his ground. He thought of his grandfather, of the forty years of service that had earned him that pocket watch, of the pride his Mam took in keeping the suit pristine. It was more than fabric; it was his armour, his history. "This is what I'm wearing," he repeated, his gaze unwavering. For a moment, it seemed a battle was imminent, but Frank, the musical director, happened to be passing. He took in the scene, glanced at the suit, then at Rhys's determined face. "Let him wear the suit, Portia," Frank said, with the weary authority of a man who knew which battles to fight. "The whole point is he's not one of you lot. Let him be him." Portia sighed dramatically but relented, contenting herself with insisting on a new white shirt and a pair of polished black dress shoes that felt as alien on his feet as ice skates.

Dressed in his grandfather’s suit, Rhys felt a strange sense of calm descend. The thick wool was a comforting weight on his shoulders. He sat in the makeup chair, flinching as a young woman dusted powder on his face, the sensation utterly foreign. All around him, the frantic, high-strung energy of showtime built to a crescendo. Performers practised their routines in corners, muttering to themselves, stretching, bouncing on the balls of their feet. The air grew thick with the smells of hairspray and atomised ambition. Rhys, however, felt strangely detached from it all, an anchor of stillness in a swirling vortex. He had done his work. He had fought for his suit. He had found his voice. All that was left was to sing.

He pulled out his phone, a final connection to his real life before he had to surrender it. The screen lit up with a flood of notifications. Cerys’s Facebook post had taken on a life of its own. It had been shared by hundreds, then thousands. There were blurry photos of his Mam’s living room, now crammed with neighbours and relatives, a huge, hand-painted banner reading 'TONYPANDY'S TENOR - GO RHYS!' strung between the picture rails. He zoomed in on a picture of his Mam, her face glowing with a pride so fierce it seemed to radiate through the cracked screen of his phone. He saw Mrs Hughes, raising a glass, and Dai the bookie giving a thumbs-up to the camera. His heart swelled. It wasn't about the money or the fame. It was about this. This moment, for them. A text from Cerys flashed up. 'Whole street's gone mad. Mam's crying every time your name's mentioned. We love you. SING IT FOR GRANDAD. xxx' He typed a quick reply, 'Love you all. I will.' and then turned his phone off, severing the last tie to the world outside.

"Two minutes, people! Final checks! Places!" The runner's voice cut through the nervous hum. A sudden, powerful surge of adrenaline hit Rhys like a physical shock, sharp and cold and exhilarating. They were herded from the relative comfort of the green room into the deep, dark shadows of the wings. The sound that hit them was a revelation. It wasn't the distant noise of a crowd, but a physical force, a low, visceral rumble of thousands of people packed into the auditorium, their collective anticipation a living entity. The sound vibrated up through the soles of his new shoes, into his bones. It was the most terrifying and beautiful sound he had ever heard.

They were lined up in performance order. Rhys was fifth. He stood in the gloom, the heat of the stage lights spilling into the darkness, catching the glitter on the girl band’s outfits in front of him. One of the girls, her face a mask of professionally applied calm that didn't quite reach her wide, nervous eyes, turned and gave him a shaky smile. "Good luck," she whispered. "You too," he whispered back. In that moment, they weren't competitors; they were fellow travellers on the edge of the same cliff, about to take the same leap of faith. The iconic theme music swelled, impossibly loud, and the host strode out onto the stage to a deafening roar. Rhys watched him on a nearby monitor, a slick, smiling figure bathing in the adoration of the crowd. Then the camera panned across the finalists waiting in the wings. For a dizzying second, he saw his own face on the screen, impossibly serious in his grandfather’s suit, his expression stark and pale under the harsh lighting. He looked like a man from another time, a black and white photograph dropped into a world of dazzling colour. The host began his introductions, the names of the judges punctuated by fresh waves of applause. Rhys’s heart was no longer a bird, but a war drum, beating a frantic, powerful rhythm against his ribs. He was here. It was real. "And kicking off our grand final tonight," the host bellowed, his voice echoing through the studio, "give it up for the sensational sounds of… Starlight!" The girl band took a collective, terrified breath, pasted on their brilliant smiles, and ran out into the blinding light.The waiting was a unique form of torture. Standing in the electric-charged darkness of the wings, Rhys watched the first few acts on the monitors, feeling a universe away from them. The girl band, Starlight, delivered a flawless, high-energy pop number full of tight choreography and perfect smiles. They were professionals, a slickly produced package, and the crowd loved them, their applause loud and enthusiastic. Next was the magician, whose sleight of hand was so quick and polished it felt like actual sorcery. He commanded the stage with a showman’s easy confidence, earning gasps and another thunderous ovation. Each act was a reminder of how out of place Rhys was. They were performers. He was a man who sang to empty offices. He ran his thumb over the coarse wool of his grandfather’s suit jacket, a subconscious gesture of grounding himself, of remembering who he was singing for.

He felt a hand on his arm and turned to see Leo, the young singer-songwriter, who was on next. The boy’s face was pale, his eyes huge. "I think I'm going to be sick," Leo whispered, his voice trembling. "It's like… a wall of noise out there." Rhys looked at the kid, who couldn't have been more than eighteen, and saw his own terror reflected back at him. Instinct took over. "Just find one face," Rhys said, the advice coming from nowhere, from some deep well of instinct. "Don't look at all of them. Just find one person and sing to them. No one else." Leo stared at him, then gave a jerky nod, a flicker of gratitude in his eyes. When the host called his name, Leo took a deep, shaky breath and walked out into the light, his guitar clutched like a shield. He sang a quiet, heartfelt ballad, and Rhys could see him on the monitor, his eyes fixed on a single spot somewhere in the middle distance, just as Rhys had told him. The performance was fragile, beautiful, and the audience, hushed and respectful, rewarded him with warm, gentle applause.

Then, there was nowhere left to hide. A runner with a headset gave Rhys a final thumbs-up. "You're next, mate. Go smash it." The host's voice boomed from the stage, amplified to the size of a god's. "Next up, we have a real wildcard! He was a last-minute replacement, but the judges saw something special. He's a cleaner from Cardiff, and tonight he's singing for his life! Please, give a massive welcome to… Rhys Price!" The name echoed around the vast space, followed by a wave of polite, curious applause. This was it. Every beat of his heart hammered against his ribs like a fist against a locked door. He took one last, deep breath, and walked out of the darkness and into the fire.

The light was a physical assault. It was blinding, erasing the thousands of individual faces in the audience and fusing them into a single, terrifying mass of expectation. The heat was immense. He could feel sweat prickling his hairline immediately. He walked to the 'X' marked on the floor, his new shoes feeling stiff and unnatural. He could see them now, the judges, sitting behind their long, glowing desk. Three powerful, impassive figures who held his future in their hands. He saw Simon Cowell lean forward slightly, his expression one of bored neutrality, a man waiting to be impressed but not expecting to be. The fear Rhys had been holding at bay surged, threatening to drown him. His mouth was dry. His hands felt cold and clammy. He was a fraud. A cleaner in his grandad's suit. What was he doing here?

The opening chords of 'Delilah' struck up, sharp and clear from the incredible live band. This was the point of no return. He had to sing. He brought the microphone to his lips, his hand trembling slightly. He opened his mouth and for a terrifying, heart-stopping second, no sound came out. Panic, cold and absolute, seized him. But then, an image flashed in his mind, clear and vivid. It was the biscuit tin on the counter of the bakery, Megan’s faded Highland cow smiling from the lid. It was the flurry of coins and crumpled notes dropping inside. He thought of Cerys’s furious, loving voice on the phone: *'I forbid it.'* He thought of his Mam's face, radiant with pride. He wasn’t a fraud. He was an investment. He was a repository of hope for an entire community. He closed his eyes, and the blinding light of Wembley vanished. He was on the seventeenth floor. The view of Cardiff twinkled below. He was safe. He was home.

When he opened his eyes again, the fear was gone, replaced by a white-hot core of purpose. He wasn't singing to the judges anymore. He was singing to the night security guard who always gave him a nod. He was singing to his Mam, to Cerys, to Mr. Evans. He was singing to his grandfather. The first line came out not as a timid plea, but as a rich, mournful statement, a story already in progress. "I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window." The voice was not the reedy, nervous sound from the start of his soundcheck. It was the voice that had bounced off the mahogany desks and glass partitions, a voice that was full of loneliness and longing, made resonant by years of singing in secret. It filled the vast auditorium with an intimacy that was startling, drawing twenty thousand people into its confidence.

A change rippled through the audience. The polite applause for 'the cleaner from Cardiff' had created a certain expectation—a novelty act, a feel-good story. But this was something else. This was a voice. People who had been chatting to their neighbours fell silent. Those looking at their phones put them down. In the middle of the second verse, a close-up of Simon Cowell flashed on the giant screens. The bored mask had slipped. His head was tilted, his eyes narrowed, not with criticism, but with intense, analytical focus. He was listening. Really listening. Rhys saw none of this. He was lost in the song, the tragic, passionate story pouring out of him, his own story of being on the outside looking in, of desperation and a final, defiant act. The music swelled around him, and he met it, his voice soaring over the top, no longer just singing the notes but inhabiting them, tearing the emotion from the heart of the melody.

He reached the climax, the final, explosive chorus. This was the moment. He wasn't a cleaner. He wasn't a wildcard. He was a singer, and this was his stage. He planted his feet, leaned into the microphone, and unleashed the final, desperate cry. "My, my, my, Delilah!" It was not just a lyric; it was a primal roar of hope and frustration, of a lifetime of pent-up passion. He held the final note, pouring every ounce of his journey into it—the C sharp wheel, the bus ticket, the biscuit tin, the weight of his grandfather's suit—and sent it soaring into the rafters of the arena. The sound hung in the air for an impossible, perfect second as the band crashed to a finish. And then, for one heartbeat, there was absolute, profound silence. It was a silence more powerful than any applause, a collective holding of breath. Then, the dam broke. The sound that hit him was not applause; it was a physical eruption. The entire arena, from the front row to the highest seats in the gods, was on its feet, roaring. The sound was a tidal wave of pure, unadulterated approval that washed over him, so powerful it almost knocked him off his feet. He opened his eyes, which he hadn't realised he'd closed, and stared out, bewildered. He saw a sea of standing, cheering, crying strangers. He saw the judges, all three of them, on their feet, clapping. He looked at his own hands. They were rock steady. He had done it. He had sung his heart out.The roar was a physical entity, a living creature that filled the arena and pressed in on Rhys from all sides. He stood blinking in the white light, his mind a silent, humming blank. The host, a man whose dazzling smile was a permanent fixture, glided over and placed a hand on his shoulder, the sequins on his jacket scratching against the thick wool of Rhys’s suit. The gesture was meant to be steadying, but Rhys felt like a statue being claimed by a brightly-coloured pigeon. The host leaned in, his voice a smooth, professional murmur against the tidal wave of noise. "Rhys Price, ladies and gentlemen! Rhys, how on earth are you feeling right now?" He held the microphone out. Rhys looked at it as if it were a strange alien artifact. What could he say? He couldn’t articulate the maelstrom inside him, the vertigo of standing on a peak he never knew he was climbing. He swallowed, the sound loud in his own ears. "A bit dizzy," he said, his voice a hoarse whisper. The crowd laughed, a warm, affectionate sound this time, and the host beamed. "I think we're all a bit dizzy after that!"

The judges’ comments began, and the arena fell into a rapt silence. The first judge, a woman known for her emotional reactions, was dabbing at her eyes with a perfectly manicured finger. "Rhys," she began, her voice thick with unshed tears. "I don't think I've ever seen anything like that. That wasn't a performance. That was a testimony. You didn't just sing a song; you told us your entire life story in three minutes. You could feel every quiet night, every hope, every bit of longing. It was just... breathtakingly honest. Thank you." Rhys felt a hot blush creep up his neck. He could only nod, completely overwhelmed, his gaze fixed on the gleaming surface of the judges' desk. The next judge, younger and sharper, leaned forward, her expression one of pure excitement. "Do you know what we just witnessed?" she asked the audience, who roared in agreement. "We saw a transformation. You walked out here looking so nervous, and we were all thinking, 'Okay, here's the lovely wildcard story.' But then the music started, and you became someone else. You owned that stage. You owned that song. You owned every single person in this room. That wasn't a competition performance, Rhys. That was a headline act."

Then, all eyes turned to Simon. He was leaning back in his chair, his fingers steepled in front of his lips. He was silent for a long, calculating moment, letting the tension build. Rhys’s heart, which had just started to slow, kicked back into a frantic rhythm. This was the voice that mattered, the one that could build careers or shatter them with a single, cutting phrase. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and measured, devoid of the usual hyperbole. "This," he said, the single word cutting through the silence. "This is why we make this show. It’s not about the kids from stage school or the manufactured bands who have been coached to within an inch of their lives. It's about finding… this." He gestured towards Rhys with an open palm. "It's about finding a diamond in the rough. A man who cleans floors for a living, who comes out here in his grandfather's suit with no idea how good he really is. That performance was raw. It was authentic." The word hung in the air, a benediction. "It was magnificent. You, Rhys Price, are the reason this show exists. And tonight, you are the man to beat."

The validation was so absolute, so far beyond anything Rhys had dared to imagine, that it almost didn't feel real. He felt the weight of every person in the valley, of his Mam’s tears, of Cerys’s fierce belief, coalesce into a single, overwhelming lump in his throat. The host prompted him for a reaction, but the only word he could manage, the only word that felt true, was from the heart of his own world. "Diolch," he whispered into the microphone. "Diolch yn fawr." Thank you. Thank you very much. The host, sensing he could get no more from the shell-shocked singer, clapped him on the shoulder once more. "Let's hear it one more time for Rhys Price!" The roar from the crowd was even louder this time, a deafening coronation. As he was guided off the stage and back into the velvet darkness of the wings, he felt as though he was floating, his feet not quite touching the ground. He caught a final glimpse of himself on the monitor, a man in a dark suit surrounded by blinding light, his face a mask of stunned disbelief.

The atmosphere backstage had been completely reset. The moment he stepped into the wings, he was met with a spontaneous burst of applause from the crew. Sound engineers, camera operators, and runners who had barely glanced at him before now grinned and clapped him on the back. The runner who had rushed him to the stage earlier now shook his hand with genuine enthusiasm. "Mate, you killed it. Absolutely killed it." He saw Chloe, the unflappable woman from London, standing by a lighting desk. For the first time, her professional mask had slipped. She wasn't looking at her clipboard or her phone. She was just looking at him, a small, slow smile of genuine astonishment on her face. Leo, the young guitarist, rushed towards him, his own performance forgotten. "Rhys! That was unbelievable! You were… unbelievable!" he gushed, his earlier nervousness replaced by pure, unadulterated fan worship. Rhys was buffeted by the goodwill, nodding and mumbling thanks, feeling utterly disconnected from the man they were all congratulating.

He was led back to the green room, the sanctuary that had once felt so alien. Now, as he entered, all conversation stopped. The remaining contestants, a dance troupe and a comedian, looked up at him with a mixture of awe and naked terror. He was no longer the quiet Welshman in the corner; he was the frontrunner, the phenomenon, the one Simon Cowell had crowned. He sank back onto the same sofa, the cushions yielding beneath him, and the adrenaline began to recede, leaving a profound, humming emptiness in its wake. He was in the eye of the hurricane now. The rest of the show unfolded on the monitors, but the sound was muted in his head. He was acutely aware of the voting lines being open, of millions of people across the country picking up their phones. The idea was too vast to comprehend. He caught his reflection in a dark TV screen. The man staring back was him, but it wasn't. The worried lines around the eyes were still there, but they were shadowed by something else now – a wild, terrified hope. He looked down at his hands, resting on the knees of his grandfather's trousers. The calluses from the mop handle were still there, rough against the smooth wool. They were the hands of Rhys Price, the cleaner. But they had just held a nation captive. The two realities warred within him, so impossibly distant from one another that he felt he might tear apart.The green room was no longer a haven; it was a holding cell. The final two acts, a manic dance troupe and a wry comedian, had their moments on stage, their performances flickering across the monitors like dispatches from another world. Rhys registered none of it. He sat perfectly still, his hands clasped so tightly in his lap that his knuckles were white mountains on a ruddy landscape. He felt as though he had been hollowed out, the raw emotion of his performance leaving a vast, echoing chamber inside him where his heart used to be. The other contestants gave him a wide berth, as if he were radioactive, their own anxieties now compounded by the impossible standard he had set. He was no longer one of them; he was an event, a phenomenon, a walking embodiment of the show's most potent myth.

After an eternity, he felt a desperate, visceral need to reconnect with something real. He fumbled in the pocket of his grandfather’s suit and retrieved his phone. The moment he powered it on, it was as if he’d opened a floodgate. The device shuddered and whirred in his palm, a frantic, vibrating seizure as a tidal wave of notifications poured in. Hundreds of texts, missed calls, Facebook tags, Twitter mentions. It was a digital roar, the chaotic, joyous, overwhelming sound of his small world exploding into the national consciousness. He couldn’t read any of it. It was too much, a blur of names and exclamation marks. He scrolled numbly until he found the one name that mattered, and pressed ‘call’.

The phone was answered on the first ring, but the voice wasn’t Cerys’s, it was a wall of noise: cheering, singing, a raucous, off-key rendition of ‘Delilah’ being belted out by what sounded like half the Rhondda Valley crammed into his mother’s terraced house. "HE'S ON THE PHONE!" a voice shrieked, and the noise somehow intensified before being muffled, as if a hand had been clamped over the receiver. "Rhys? Can you hear me? It's Cerys!" her voice yelled, straining to be heard over the celebratory chaos. "Oh my god, Rhys, you were… we’re… Mam is in bits! The whole street is in tears! You did it! You bloody did it!" He could hear his Mam in the background, her voice thick with happy sobs. "My boy! My beautiful boy! That was for your Grandad, I know it was! He heard you, love, he heard you!" The raw, unfiltered pride in her voice was the first thing that had felt truly real since he’d walked off stage. It wasn't about the judges or the audience of strangers; it was this. This was the prize.

The final moments of the show were a blur. A runner gently herded the remaining contestants out of the green room one last time. The camaraderie, even the nervous respect, had evaporated, replaced by a raw, desperate tension. All ten finalists were lined up on the vast stage under the glare of the lights, a strange tableau of sequins, leather, street-style, and Rhys in his sombre, time-honoured suit. The roar from the crowd was constant now, a restless sea of noise. The host began the brutal, theatrical process of elimination, his voice slick with manufactured empathy as he read out the names of those who hadn't made the top five, then the top three. The magician was out, his charming smile finally faltering. The dance troupe, their faces streaked with sweat and running makeup, were sent home. Rhys stood like a stone, his mind utterly blank, focusing only on the worn fabric of his grandfather's cuffs.

Then there were three. Leo, the young singer-songwriter, was announced in third place. A look of pure, unadulterated relief washed over the boy's face. He had exceeded all expectations and was free. He turned to Rhys, grabbing his arm with surprising strength. "You've got this, man," he whispered, his voice full of genuine conviction. "It has to be you." And then he was gone, leaving two acts standing at the centre of the world. The contrast was almost comical in its perfection. On one side, Starlight, the three impossibly beautiful, perfectly harmonised girls in their glittering, professionally styled outfits. They were the epitome of modern, manufactured pop. And on the other, Rhys Price, the cleaner from Cardiff, solid and solemn in his grandfather's suit, a man who looked as though he had wandered in from another century. He was authenticity. They were aspiration. The host stood between them, a human fulcrum balancing two opposing forces of the entertainment industry.

The lights swirled, the music swelled to a heart-stopping crescendo, and the host held up the single golden envelope that contained an entire future. "The moment has come," he boomed, his voice resonating with false gravity. "Two incredible acts. But there can only be one winner. The votes have been counted and verified. I can now reveal that the winner of 'Britain's Got The Voice', a hundred-thousand-pound prize, and a life-changing recording contract is..." He paused, his eyes flicking from Starlight’s lead singer, her face a perfect mask of desperate hope, to Rhys, whose face was a blank slate of shock. The host tore open the envelope, milking the silence for every drop of drama. The camera zoomed in tight on Rhys’s face, catching the slight tremor in his jaw, the deep-set exhaustion in his eyes. He held his breath. In a small terraced house in Tonypandy, a whole street held its breath. The entire country held its breath. The host took one final, deep inhale."...Rhys Price!"

The name, spoken into the electric silence, did not register at first. It was just a sound, two syllables that belonged to a man who pushed a mop bucket. For a split second, Rhys’s brain refused to connect that sound to the cataclysmic event unfolding around him. Then, the world exploded. An eruption of sound, a physical concussion of noise from the audience that felt like a shockwave. Confetti cannons fired from the wings, blasting shimmering gold and silver streamers into the air, which swirled and danced in the turbulent eddies of the hot stage lights. The members of Starlight, their faces collapsing for a fraction of a second into genuine disappointment before snapping back into practiced, professional smiles, turned and engulfed him in a flurry of glittery fabric and expensive perfume. "Congratulations, Rhys! You deserve it!" one of them said, her voice bright and brittle right by his ear. He felt a brief, awkward pressure as they hugged him, but his arms remained pinned to his sides, his body rigid with shock.

The host was back, his arm thrown around Rhys’s shoulders, pulling him towards the centre of the stage. The roar from the crowd was relentless, a physical force that vibrated through the floor, up through the soles of his unfamiliar shoes, and into his bones. He felt himself being turned to face a camera, a trophy being pushed into his nerveless hands. It was heavy, far heavier than he expected, a solid, cold weight of polished metal. He stared down at it, at the impossible shape of it in his calloused hands. It was an object from a different universe, and its presence in his grasp made no sense. He looked up, past the blinding lights, trying to see the faces in the crowd, but they were just a single, roaring, amorphous entity. He was completely, utterly alone in a room with twenty thousand people.

"Unbelievable!" the host bellowed, his voice straining to be heard over the din. "The crooning cleaner from Cardiff has done it! Rhys, you have just won one hundred thousand pounds and a recording contract. What can you possibly be thinking?" Rhys looked at the man's impossibly white teeth, at the microphone held expectantly before his face. He tried to form a word, any word, but his throat was locked tight. He thought of the Gwentfinity Tower, of the quiet, predictable hum of its mechanical heart. He thought of the C sharp squeak of his bucket wheel. That was a rhythm he understood. This chaotic, roaring celebration was a language he couldn’t speak. He simply shook his head, a small, lost gesture that was broadcast on giant screens across the arena. The host, a master of his craft, took it as humility. "He's speechless, ladies and gentlemen! Utterly overcome! But we are going to ask him to do the one thing he does better than anyone – sing for us one more time! Here is your winner, with his winning song, Rhys Price!"

The band, flawless and professional, struck up the chords to 'Delilah' once more. The sound was almost a gentle whisper beneath the roar of the crowd. Rhys looked down at the heavy trophy in one hand and the microphone in the other. He couldn’t hold both. In a moment of pure, unthinking instinct, he carefully placed the gleaming award on the polished black floor at his feet, as if it were a fragile piece of glass. He then gripped the microphone with both hands, his knuckles white. He found the small red light of the main camera, the one that was broadcasting this impossible moment to millions, to the small terraced house in Tonypandy. He closed his eyes, and sang. This time, there was no defiance, no desperate plea. The voice that emerged was different. It was quieter, softer, thick with an emotion so profound it threatened to break with every note. It was a love song not to a treacherous woman, but to a life, to a community, to every single person who had dropped a coin in that biscuit tin.

He sang the song not as a performance, but as a prayer. Each note was a word of thanks. His voice trembled, not with nerves, but with the sheer, crushing weight of gratitude. When he reached the chorus, he didn't roar. He let the melody swell with a quiet, powerful grace, his voice breaking just for a second on the final "my". As he held the last note, a single tear he hadn't known was coming escaped and traced a hot, slow path down his cheek. He didn't wipe it away. He let it fall. The song ended. The roar of the crowd was still there, but it sounded different now, softer, imbued with the emotion he had shared. In the silence that followed the music, before the host could speak, Rhys brought the microphone to his lips one last time and whispered, his voice cracking, "For you, Mam."

The show ended in a blizzard of confetti and chaos. The stage was immediately flooded with people. Producers, executives, other contestants offering dazed congratulations. He felt a small, fierce body collide with him and found himself wrapped in a hug by Cerys, who had seemingly appeared out of thin air, her face buried in his shoulder, her body shaking with sobs. She pulled back, her eyes red, her face a mess of joyful tears. "I knew it! I always knew it!" she choked out, hitting his arm lightly. "You bloody idiot, I always knew it!" Then his Mam was there, her face glowing, her hands framing his face as she kissed his cheeks, her tears mingling with his own. "Oh, my Rhys," she whispered, her voice full of a love so powerful it was the only anchor in his swirling world. "Your Grandad would be so, so proud." The three of them clung to each other, a small, weeping island of Welsh reality in the middle of a swirling ocean of television fantasy.

He was eventually, gently, prised away from them by Chloe. Her face, usually a mask of brisk efficiency, was soft with a genuine, unguarded smile. "Rhys," she said, her London accent sounding warmer than it ever had before. "We need to get you to the press conference. Your life is about to get very, very busy." She led him away from the comforting circle of his family, through a maze of backstage corridors. The sound of the audience faded, replaced by a new, more menacing noise – a cacophony of shouting voices and the frantic, percussive clicking of a hundred cameras. They entered a brightly lit room packed with journalists, all of them on their feet, their hands raised, their faces hungry. "Rhys! Rhys, over here!" "How does it feel?" "What will you do with the money?" The questions came at him like a volley of stones. He stood blinking in the blitzkrieg of flashbulbs, Chloe's hand a steadying presence on his back. He was no longer Rhys Price. He was a headline. A story. A product. He felt a sudden, profound longing for the quiet solitude of the seventeenth floor, for the gentle, predictable C sharp of the bucket wheel. That rhythm was gone. It had been replaced by this frantic, deafening new beat, and he had no idea how to dance to it.The press conference was a feeding frenzy. The flashbulbs were a constant, violent flicker, creating a strobe effect that dislocated time and made the journalists’ faces merge into a single, ravenous maw. They shouted over one another, their questions a barrage of sharp-edged projectiles aimed at the softest parts of his life. Rhys stood at the podium, blinking, the heavy trophy a cold anchor in his hands while his mind floated somewhere high above, looking down on this bizarre scene. Chloe stood just to his side, a calm, commanding presence who would occasionally interject, parrying a particularly intrusive question or steering the conversation back to the show, the win, the music. He was grateful for her, but it also reinforced the feeling that he was a ventriloquist's dummy, the star of a show he had no part in directing.

"Rhys! Rhys! What's the first thing you'll do with the hundred thousand pounds?" a man with a red, florid face yelled from the front row. Rhys looked at him, completely blank. He hadn't thought about it. The money was an abstract concept, a number with too many zeroes to feel real. He thought of his Mam’s leaking roof, of the biscuit tin, of the pathetic £42.17 that had sat in his bank account just days ago. "Pay my sister back," he said, his voice quiet, almost lost in the room. "She bought my bus ticket." A ripple of laughter and a fresh volley of flashes went through the room. It was the perfect answer, the soundbite they craved, encapsulating his entire story in a single, humble sentence. He hadn't meant it to be; it was just the truth.

"Will you go back to your cleaning job on Monday?" a woman with sharp glasses called out. The question was absurd. He pictured himself pushing the mop bucket down the corridors of the Gwentfinity Tower, his trophy sitting on top like a bizarre hood ornament. The image was so ridiculous he almost smiled. "I don't think they'll have me," he said. "I've probably voided my contract." Again, laughter. He was good at this, apparently. This game of being the humble, working-class hero. He just had to tell the truth. It was the only thing he knew how to do. He felt a profound weariness settle deep in his bones. He wanted nothing more than to be back in his small, quiet flat, with the door locked and the world shut out.

The after-party was even worse. It was held in a cavernous, low-lit bar within the Wembley complex, the air thick with expensive perfume and the low thrum of music that was too cool for a melody. Here, the piranhas of the press were replaced by the sharks of the industry. Sleek, smiling men in sharp suits and women with terrifyingly perfect hair moved through the crowd, their eyes constantly scanning for someone more important to talk to. Rhys, with his Mam on one arm and Cerys on the other, felt like a shepherd who had accidentally led his flock into a wolf sanctuary. His Mam, bless her, was in her element, accepting congratulations with the grace of a queen mother, her face aglow with a pride that was impervious to the cynical atmosphere. Cerys, however, was more like him, her eyes wide, her posture stiff, clutching a glass of champagne as if it were a weapon. "It's like a zoo," she muttered to him under her breath. "But you're not sure if you're a visitor or one of the exhibits."

He was passed from person to person, a human trophy being shown off. He shook hands with television presenters he'd only ever seen on a screen, with record label executives whose names he immediately forgot, with other musicians who looked him up and down with an unreadable mixture of congratulations and professional jealousy. He drank a glass of champagne that tasted like fizzy anxiety and tried to smile until his face ached. He saw Leo, the young guitarist, talking earnestly with a man in a leather jacket who looked like a manager. He saw the girls from Starlight, already surrounded by a phalanx of their team, plotting their next move. This was their world. They understood its rhythms, its unspoken rules. He was just a tourist, and he was hopelessly, desperately lost. He found himself cornered by a television producer who wanted to talk about a reality documentary series. "The Crooning Cleaner: From Mop to Millions! The public will eat it up!" The man’s eyes glittered with the prospect of ratings, and Rhys felt a cold dread creep up his spine. He was a story to be packaged and sold, a narrative to be exploited until a new one came along.

He finally managed to extricate himself, mumbling an excuse about finding his Mam. He slipped through a set of glass doors and found himself on a small, deserted balcony overlooking the stadium car park. The night air was cool and clean against his hot face. Below, the last of the crowds were dispersing, tiny figures scattering into the night, their voices faint and distant. The silence up here was a balm. He leaned his hands on the cool metal railing and took the first deep, steadying breath he'd had in hours. The door opened behind him and Cerys stepped out, holding two fresh glasses of champagne. She handed one to him. "Thought you might need rescuing," she said, her voice back to its normal, wry self. "They're circling you like you're the last sausage roll at a party." He took a sip of the champagne. It tasted a little better out here. "I don't belong here, Cerys," he said, the words a simple, unadorned truth. "This isn't me."

"Of course it isn't," she said, surprisingly gentle. She leaned on the railing beside him, looking out at the sprawling, glittering lights of London. "Your 'you' is a bloke in overalls singing Tom Jones to a bunch of empty desks. This is something else. This is the 'what happens next' part." She turned to look at him, her expression serious. "But that bloke, the one who sings to the desks? He's the one who got you here. Don't you dare lose him in all this." She clinked her glass against his. "They all think you're a story, Rhys. The cleaner who made it big. But we know you're just our Rhys, with a daft, brilliant voice. Just remember that." Her words were an anchor, a small, solid piece of truth in the swirling madness. He looked at his sister, at her fierce, loving face, and felt a wave of gratitude so intense it almost buckled his knees. "I won't," he promised, as much to himself as to her. "I won't."

They were interrupted by the soft clearing of a throat. Rhys turned to see Simon Cowell standing in the doorway, holding a glass of mineral water. He was smaller in person than he appeared on television, but his presence seemed to suck all the air out of the small balcony. Cerys froze, her eyes wide. "Rhys," Simon said, his voice quiet, almost conversational. "Congratulations. Truly." He walked over to stand beside them at the railing, ignoring Cerys completely, his focus entirely on Rhys. "You were magnificent tonight. You reminded me why I do this job." He took a sip of his water, his gaze fixed on the horizon. "I wanted to tell you myself. The work starts now. There's a studio booked for you. Monday morning, nine a.m. We need to capture this. The momentum. We're going to make an album, and we're going to make it fast. Your life, Rhys Price, is no longer your own. Are you ready for that?"

The question hung in the cool night air, blunt and stripped of all sentiment. This wasn't a congratulations; it was a contract negotiation, a warning, and a command, all rolled into one. Monday morning. In less than thirty-six hours. There would be no trip home to celebrate, no time to decompress, no moment to let the reality of his win sink in. The machine had him now, and it was already pulling him forward at a terrifying speed. Rhys looked from Simon's impassive face to Cerys’s stunned expression. He thought of his quiet flat, of the predictable rhythm of his life that had been shattered forever. Ready? He wasn't remotely ready. He was terrified. But Cerys’s words echoed in his mind: *'Don't you dare lose him.'* He met Simon's gaze, his own expression unreadable. "I'll be there," he said, his voice steady. Simon gave a small, satisfied nod, as if the answer had been a foregone conclusion. "Good man," he said. Then, as quickly as he had appeared, he turned and was gone, melting back into the party, leaving a profound chill in his wake.

The journey back to the hotel was a silent, surreal affair. A sleek black car with tinted windows whisked the three of them through the deserted late-night streets of London. His Mam had finally succumbed to the overwhelming emotion and exhaustion of the day, dozing lightly in the corner, her head resting against the plush leather. Cerys sat beside Rhys, staring out at the blur of streetlights, her earlier bravado gone, replaced by a quiet, worried watchfulness. Rhys held the heavy trophy on his lap, its polished surface reflecting the passing lights in distorted, fleeting patterns. It felt alien, an unearned artefact from a life he was only pretending to lead. He tried to feel joy, to feel the dizzying triumph of winning, but all he felt was a deep, seismic dislocation, as if the tectonic plates of his entire existence had shifted violently beneath his feet.

Back in his palatial hotel room, the silence was even more profound. Cerys and his Mam were in an adjoining room, and after a brief, emotional goodnight, he was finally alone. The adrenaline had long since drained away, leaving a bone-deep exhaustion that felt less like tiredness and more like a form of grief. He couldn't sleep. He stood at the huge window, the same one he had looked out of that morning when he was just a nervous cleaner from Cardiff. The Wembley Arch was still there, but now it was lit up, a triumphant white bow against the dark sky. It looked different. Everything looked different. He looked at his reflection in the glass. The man in the expensive room, wearing a dead man's suit, looked back at him, a stranger with his own face.

On the gleaming mahogany table beside the bed, the golden trophy sat, glinting under the soft light of a lamp. Next to it, he had placed his grandfather's silver pocket watch. The two objects sat side-by-side, a study in contrasts. One was a symbol of a life of quiet dignity, of forty years of hard, unseen labour. The other was a symbol of instant, explosive fame, a prize won in a matter of minutes. He picked up the pocket watch, its familiar, solid weight a comfort in his hand. Then he looked at the trophy. He had won. He had the money, the contract, the future that people dreamed of. He had everything. But as he stood there, suspended ten floors above the sleeping city, a profound and terrifying thought struck him with the force of a physical blow. In gaining this new world, he was utterly, irrevocably lost from his old one. And he had no idea how to find his way back.Sleep, when it finally came, was a shallow, dreamless state, a brief submersion in a dark pool that offered no rest. Rhys awoke with a jolt, his heart hammering, the unfamiliar silence of the hotel room more jarring than any alarm clock. For a disorienting moment, he didn't know where he was. The pale, watery London light filtering through a gap in the thick curtains was alien, the air too clean and temperature-controlled. Then he saw it. Sitting on the table, it caught the morning light with a cold, indifferent gleam. The trophy. It all came rushing back not as a triumphant memory, but as a series of jarring, high-contrast snapshots: the blinding lights, the roar, Simon Cowell’s impassive face, his mother’s tears, the frantic blitz of camera flashes. It felt like something he’d watched on television happen to someone else.

He slid out of the enormous bed, the plush carpet soft and strange under his bare feet. His grey overalls and work boots, which a hotel staff member had neatly folded and placed on a chair, looked like relics from an archaeological dig, objects from a life lived a thousand years ago. He felt a phantom ache in his lower back, the ghost of years spent leaning over a mop handle. He picked up his phone from the bedside table, his stomach twisting with a strange mixture of dread and compulsion. The screen lit up, not with a single lock screen picture, but with a solid wall of notifications, a relentless digital blizzard. He opened the web browser, his thumb hovering shakily over the search bar. He typed his own name. The results loaded instantly, a deluge of articles from every major news outlet. 'THE CROONING CLEANER: RAGS-TO-RICHES RHYS WINS BRITAIN'S BIGGEST PRIZE'. 'VOICE OF THE VALLEYS: HOW A WELSH CLEANER STOLE THE NATION'S HEART'. 'FROM SPLOTT TO SPOTLIGHT: THE INCREDIBLE STORY OF RHYS PRICE'. He stared at the headlines, his own name repeated over and over until it lost all meaning. They had condensed his life into a snappy, marketable slogan. He clicked on one of the articles. There was a picture of him on stage, his face contorted in a rictus of pure emotion as he sang, a single tear visible on his cheek. Underneath, the article detailed his job, his flat in Splott, his sister's fundraising. They had dissected him, laid him bare for public consumption, and repackaged him as a fairytale. He felt a hot wave of violation and shame. This wasn't his life; it was a caricature, a piece of public property. He snapped the phone shut and threw it onto the bed as if it were burning his hand.

A soft knock at the door made him jump. It was Cerys, already dressed, her face scrubbed clean of last night's makeup, her expression sharp and assessing. She carried a tray with a pot of tea and two mugs. She had bypassed the hotel’s extravagant room service offerings in favour of the kettle and teabags provided in the room. It was a small, defiant act of normality that made Rhys’s heart ache with affection. "Thought you might be hiding," she said, placing the tray on the table next to the trophy. She poured two mugs of strong, dark tea, the way they always had it at home. "Mam's still spark out. Woke up once, asked if it was all a dream, and went straight back to sleep when I told her it wasn't." She handed him a mug, her fingers brushing his. "How are you? And I mean really."

He took a sip of the hot tea, the familiar, comforting bitterness a small anchor in his swirling thoughts. "I feel like I've been run over by a train," he confessed, his voice rough with sleep. "And the train was made of lights and noise and smiling people who all want a piece of me." He gestured vaguely at the phone on the bed. "Have you seen it? What they're writing?" Cerys nodded, her mouth a grim line. "I've seen. 'The Crooning Cleaner'. It's catchy. They'll run with it for a while." She looked from his face to the trophy, then back again. "This is it now, isn't it? This is the first day of the rest of your life, like it says on the rubbish inspirational posters." "I want to go home," Rhys said, the words slipping out, small and childish. "I want to go for a walk down to the park. I want to buy a paper from the corner shop and have a bacon butty from the cafe. I want everything to be normal." Cerys’s expression softened with a deep, sad understanding. She walked to the window and pulled back the heavy curtain. Ten floors below, on the pavement opposite the hotel entrance, a small cluster of figures was already waiting. Photographers, their long lenses like sniper rifles, stamping their feet against the morning chill. "I don't think normal is on the menu anymore, Rhys," she said softly.

The cage was real. He was no longer just a guest in a fancy hotel; he was a prisoner in a gilded cage, and the paparazzi were the guards at the gate. The simple act of stepping outside was now a strategic operation requiring planning and security. A new kind of claustrophobia set in, more suffocating than any crowded tube train. Just as the reality of his confinement began to sink in, his hotel room phone rang, its polite, electronic burble a jarring intrusion. He stared at it, unwilling to answer, until Cerys picked it up. "Hello?… Yes, he is. One moment." She held the receiver out to him, her eyebrows raised. "It's Chloe," she mouthed. He took the phone, his hand suddenly clammy. "Hello?" "Rhys, good morning," Chloe's voice was bright, efficient, and utterly devoid of any recognition of the seismic shift that had occurred in his life. It was just another workday for her. "I hope you got some rest. Things are moving very quickly this morning. The label wants to get you into the studio tomorrow, as planned. We're sending a car for you at eight-thirty. We've also had calls from every major talk show, so your press schedule for the week is already filling up. A lawyer and an accountant from the label's business affairs department will be meeting you at the studio to walk you through the contracts. It's a lot to take in, I know, but the momentum is crucial."

He listened, the words washing over him: contracts, schedules, business affairs. It was a foreign language describing a life he couldn't imagine living. He felt a rising tide of panic, a desperate urge to tell her to stop, to make it all go away. But what could he say? *'Sorry, there's been a mistake, I'm just a cleaner from Splott, I can't do this?'* He had won. This was the prize. This relentless, terrifying, forward motion was what he had, apparently, been singing for. He looked at Cerys, who was watching him with worried eyes. He took a breath. "Okay," he said, the single word costing him an immense effort. "Eight-thirty. I'll be ready." "Excellent," Chloe said, pleased. "And Rhys? Congratulations again. You were a phenomenon last night. Now the real work begins." She hung up, leaving a dial tone buzzing in his ear. He slowly replaced the receiver, his hand shaking. The real work. He had thought cleaning the executive floor of the Gwentfinity Tower was work. He realised now that had been peace. That had been freedom.

Getting ready to leave felt like preparing for battle. He couldn't wear his grandfather’s suit; it was a sacred object, not a costume for the paparazzi. He couldn't wear his overalls. He eventually settled on a pair of simple dark trousers and the new, clean white shirt Portia had insisted on, the only items he possessed that seemed to occupy the strange new space between his old life and his new one. When his Mam emerged from her room, refreshed and beaming, she found her children sitting in a strange, tense silence. She was oblivious to the undercurrent of anxiety, her joy a buoyant, unsinkable force. "Look at this place!" she declared, pirouetting in the middle of the room. "Can you believe it, our Rhys? A superstar! Wait 'til I tell Mrs Hughes we had complimentary slippers!" Her simple, unadulterated happiness was both a comfort and a torment, a reminder of the uncomplicated dream before it had become this terrifyingly complex reality.

At eight-twenty-five, a call came from the front desk. "Your car is here, Mr. Price." The three of them gathered their few belongings. Rhys took one last look at the room, at the impossibly large bed, at the rumpled, expensive sheets. He picked up the heavy gold trophy from the table, its weight a dead, solid thing in his hand. He left his grandfather's watch behind. He couldn't take it with him. It belonged to a different world, a world of quiet integrity and earned rest. This new world felt like it would tarnish it. They rode the lift down in silence, the smooth, silent descent a countdown to exposure. As the doors opened onto the lobby, the carefully constructed peace of the hotel was shattered. The space was teeming with journalists and photographers who had managed to get inside, their cameras held aloft, their faces hungry. A line of hotel security formed a human corridor for them, a desperate attempt to maintain order. The moment they stepped out of the lift, the shouting began, a wall of noise and flashing lights that made his Mam flinch and Cerys grab his arm. "Rhys! Rhys! Over here!" He kept his eyes fixed straight ahead, focusing on the revolving door at the far end of the lobby, a distant portal to the next stage of his life. He walked through the gauntlet, his family huddled close behind him, the golden trophy clutched to his chest like a shield. He felt nothing. Not fear, not excitement. Just a profound, hollow numbness. He was an object being moved from one location to another. He was the Crooning Cleaner, and this, apparently, was his new rhythm.The black car was a sensory deprivation tank on wheels. Inside, the world was hushed, the chaotic symphony of London traffic reduced to a distant, ignorable hum. The tinted windows transformed the frantic city into a silent film, a series of passing images disconnected from reality. Rhys sat wedged between his mother and sister, the trophy a heavy, awkward presence on the floor at his feet. His Mam stared out of the window with the wide-eyed wonder of a child at her first pantomime, pointing out landmarks she recognised from the television. Her delight was a pure, bright thing, so at odds with the knot of cold dread tightening in Rhys's stomach that he felt a pang of guilt for not being able to share it. Cerys, on the other hand, was silent, her arm linked through his, her presence a small, solid point of warmth and fierce loyalty in his disorienting new universe. She wasn't looking at the landmarks; she was watching him, her brow furrowed with a concern that offered more comfort than any platitude ever could.

The car glided to a halt not in front of a grand, imposing building, but on a quiet, cobbled mews lane somewhere in what looked like a residential part of West London. The studio was completely anonymous, marked only by a heavy, slate-grey door with a small, discreet intercom. It looked less like the hit factory of a major record label and more like the entrance to a private dental practice or a secret government facility. The anonymity was more intimidating than any grand facade; it spoke of a world of quiet, serious money and an exclusivity so profound it didn't need to announce itself. The driver, who hadn't spoken a word the entire journey, ushered them out of the car and into the building, where the air was cool and smelled faintly of expensive coffee and polished concrete. The interior was a study in minimalist chic, all muted greys, exposed brickwork, and artfully placed designer furniture. It was the antithesis of his Mam's cosy, floral-wallpapered house, a space so deliberately cool and curated it felt designed to make you feel slightly underdressed and out of place.

They were led into a glass-walled meeting room where two people were already waiting, rising with practiced smiles as they entered. They were the label’s welcoming party, a man named Julian who introduced himself as the head of legal, and a woman named Alistair, the financial controller. Julian was impeccably dressed in a suit that probably cost more than Rhys’s last six months’ rent, his handshake firm and brief. Alistair was sharp and bird-like, her eyes scanning the three of them with a dispassionate, calculating gaze. They spoke a language Rhys didn't understand, a rapid-fire dialect of 'multi-album obligations', 'publishing splits', 'royalty points', 'marketing commitments', and 'recoupable advances'. Julian slid a document across the polished table, a bound manuscript thick enough to stop a door. "This is the standard agreement," he said, his voice smooth as silk. "Your personal lawyer will want to review it, of course, but it’s all very straightforward." Rhys stared at the dense blocks of text, the words blurring into meaningless shapes. His personal lawyer? He didn't have a personal dentist, let alone a lawyer.

Cerys, ever the protector, leaned forward. "A hundred thousand pounds, that's the prize money, right? When does he get that?" Alistair offered a thin smile. "The prize money is structured as an advance against future royalties," she explained, as if to a small child. "So, technically, the first hundred thousand pounds the album earns will go towards paying that back to the label. After that, Mr. Price will begin to earn a percentage of sales." Rhys felt a dizzying lurch in his stomach. So he hadn't won money. He'd been given a loan, a massive debt he now had to sing his way out of. Cerys opened her mouth to argue, her face flushing with indignation, but Julian cut her off smoothly. "It’s standard industry practice, I assure you. It ensures all parties are invested in the success of the project. Now, if you could just sign the initial letter of intent, we can get the ball rolling..." He pushed a single sheet of paper and a heavy fountain pen towards Rhys. His signature. They wanted his signature. He looked at his Mam, who was beaming with pride, utterly oblivious to the financial trap being laid. She thought her son was being given the keys to the kingdom, not being shackled to it. He looked at Cerys, who was shaking her head almost imperceptibly, a silent warning. But what choice did he have? He had already won. He had already walked through the door. He picked up the pen, its weight alien in his hand, and signed his name. The neat, simple signature looked pathetic and small on the bottom of the page that bound his entire future.

With the paperwork signed, the corporate warmth vanished as quickly as it had appeared. Julian and Alistair gathered their files, offered brisk handshakes, and were gone, leaving the three of them sitting in the silent, glass-walled room. The dream was now a business, a series of contractual obligations and financial liabilities. A few minutes later, a new figure appeared in the doorway, a man who couldn't have been much older than Rhys himself. He was dressed in fashionable jeans, an expensive-looking t-shirt, and trainers that were box-fresh. This was Ben, the producer, the hitmaker. "Rhys, mate, fantastic. I'm Ben," he said, his handshake enthusiastic, his smile genuine. "Ignore those suits, they're the boring part. This is where the fun starts." His energy was infectious, a welcome relief after the cold professionalism of the lawyers. He had a kind, intelligent face and an easy confidence that immediately put Rhys a little more at ease. "I caught your performance on Saturday. Blew me away. Absolutely blew everyone away. That raw power… we've just got to get that on a record." He led them out of the meeting room and down a corridor lined with gold and platinum discs, each one a monument to a past success.

Ben pushed open a heavy, soundproofed door, and they entered the studio's main control room. It was like the cockpit of a spaceship, dominated by a vast mixing desk that bristled with a bewildering array of faders, knobs, and glowing lights. Through a large pane of glass, Rhys could see the recording booth itself. It was a small, acoustically padded room, empty except for a single, complex-looking microphone hanging from a stand in the centre. "Right then," Ben said, rubbing his hands together with genuine excitement. "No point messing about. Let's get in there and lay something down, see what we've got. Why don't you start with 'Delilah'? Just to get you warmed up." He gestured towards the booth. Rhys looked through the glass at the solitary microphone, and his blood ran cold. It looked clinical, sterile, a piece of scientific equipment designed to capture and analyse sound. It was a world away from the vast, empty space of the Gwentfinity Tower, where his voice had been free to roam and get lost in the dark. This was a cage made of glass and foam, and he was about to be put inside it.

He left his Mam and Cerys sitting on a leather sofa behind the mixing desk and walked into the booth, the heavy door closing behind him with a soft, final thud. The silence was absolute. It wasn't the gentle, ambient silence of the sleeping office block; it was a dead, pressurised silence that seemed to press in on his eardrums. Ben’s voice crackled into the headphones he was wearing. "Okay, Rhys, can you hear me? Just give me a few bars when you're ready." Ready. He felt anything but ready. He stepped up to the microphone, its intricate metal grille just inches from his mouth. He could feel Ben watching him through the glass, his expression expectant. He took a breath, the way his Mam had taught him, and opened his mouth to sing. The note that emerged was a ghost, a thin, strangled wisp of sound that died almost instantly. It was weak, pitchy, and utterly devoid of life. The voice that had filled Wembley Arena was gone, vanished, leaving this pathetic, reedy whisper in its place. Panic, cold and sharp, pierced through him. He tried again, forcing the sound from his chest, but it came out tight and strained, a clumsy imitation of his own voice.

Through the headphones, Ben's voice was patient, encouraging. "Okay, no worries, mate. Just nerves. Happens to everyone. Shake it out. Let's take it from the top." But Rhys couldn't. The more he tried to summon the power and emotion from Saturday night, the more it eluded him. He was trying to perform, to replicate a feeling, and the effort was killing the very authenticity that had won him the show. He felt the joy of singing, the simple, secret pleasure that had been his companion for so long, curdling into a knot of shame and frustration in his stomach. He was a fraud. A one-hit wonder whose one hit had been a fluke. He could see his Mam through the glass, her smile looking a little more strained now. He saw Cerys, her arms crossed, her face a mask of worry. He was failing, right here, on his first day, in front of the two people he wanted to make proud more than anyone in the world. He shook his head, pulling off the headphones. "I can't," his voice croaked, barely a whisper. "I'm sorry. I just... I can't."

He leaned his forehead against the cool, acoustically padded wall of the booth, his eyes squeezed shut, the shame a burning heat in his face. This was it. This was where the fairytale ended, not with a bang, but with a pathetic, choked silence in a soundproofed box. He felt a complete, crushing sense of failure. He had let everyone down. The people who’d put money in the tin, his family, the judges who had believed in him. He was just a cleaner who had gotten lucky once. He heard a soft tap on the glass and opened his eyes. It was Cerys. She wasn’t in the control room anymore; she was standing right outside the booth door, and she held up her phone so he could see the screen. It was a photo. A blurry, badly-lit photo she must have taken years ago. It was of their Grandad, David Price, standing proudly in his back garden, holding a leek the size of a small child. He was wearing his work trousers and a string vest, and he had a huge, gap-toothed grin on his face, a look of pure, uncomplicated joy and pride in the thing he had grown with his own two hands.

Something in that simple, honest image unlocked the paralysis in Rhys’s chest. That was it. That was the feeling. It wasn't about the grand gesture, the big stage, the roar of the crowd. It was about the simple, quiet pride of making something good and true, something that came from the earth, from your own hands, from your own heart. He wasn't a recording artist trying to make a hit record. He was David Price's grandson. He was a man who knew how to work, how to create something real in the quiet hours. He straightened up, took a deep breath, and put the headphones back on. "Ben," he said, his voice clearer now. "Can we try something else? Not 'Delilah'. Something quiet." Ben, who had been looking worried, immediately brightened. "Sure, mate. Anything. Whatever you want." Rhys closed his eyes, shutting out the studio, the microphone, the weight of expectation. He wasn't in London. He was in the chapel choir in Tonypandy, his feet dangling high off the pew, his grandfather's rough hand resting on his shoulder. And he began to sing, not for the producer, not for the contract, but for the man in the photograph. He sang 'Ar Lan y Môr', 'Beside the Sea', an old Welsh folk song of love and longing, his voice no longer a roar, but a low, rich, resonant hum that filled the tiny booth with a deep, aching beauty.

The last note faded into the pressurised silence. Rhys kept his eyes closed, his heart steady for the first time that day. He had found it. He had found the thread. He heard the click of the intercom and Ben’s voice came through the headphones, no longer just professional, but filled with a quiet, genuine awe. "Okay," the producer said, his voice low. "Okay, Rhys. Now we're talking."That single, simple folk song changed the temperature of the entire building. In the control room, the tense, expectant silence had been replaced by something else, something softer and more profound. Cerys lowered her phone, a slow, triumphant smile spreading across her face as she met Rhys’s gaze through the glass. Their Mam, who had been twisting a tissue in her lap, was now sitting perfectly still, her eyes shining with tears, not of pride this time, but of deep, heartfelt recognition. She wasn't watching a competition winner; she was listening to her son, the boy she had raised, singing a song that was woven into the very fabric of their lives. The sound was as familiar and comforting to her as the taste of rain on the wind coming down from the mountains.

Ben, the producer, slowly pushed his chair back from the vast mixing desk. He ran a hand through his carefully styled hair, his expression one of dawning revelation. The hitmaker facade had dropped completely, replaced by the pure, unadulterated excitement of a musician who has just stumbled upon something rare and precious. He had been trying to bottle lightning, to recapture the explosive, stadium-slaying performance from Saturday night. He realised now he had been looking through the wrong end of the telescope. The power wasn't in the roar; it was in the quiet heart of the voice itself. The Wembley performance wasn't the source; it was a symptom, an explosion of a lifetime of suppressed, quiet feeling.

Rhys watched them through the glass, his heart rate slowly returning to normal. He felt fragile, exposed, but the burning shame had been washed away by the simple, clean melody. He had offered them something true, and their quiet, awestruck reaction was more validating than the roar of twenty thousand strangers. The heavy door to the booth opened, and Ben stepped inside, his movements now careful, almost reverent, as if not to startle a rare bird. He didn't speak at first, just looked at Rhys with a new, profound respect. "My grandmother used to sing that song," he said finally, his voice low. "I haven't heard it in twenty years. Rhys… that was the money shot. Not the big, bombastic stuff. That. That's your voice."

It was the beginning of a quiet deconstruction. Ben walked back into the control room and, with a decisive sweep of his arm, pushed a stack of sheet music for pre-approved pop songs off the corner of the desk. They fluttered to the floor, a discarded battle plan for a war they were no longer fighting. "Right, new plan," he announced to the room at large. "Forget the covers album. Forget what the suits think they want. We're not making 'Rhys Price sings the Great British Songbook'. We're making a Rhys Price album." He leaned towards the talk-back microphone, his energy completely re-focused. "Rhys, what else have you got? What did you sing in the chapel? What did your grandad whistle when he was in the garden? Don't think about what would make a good single. Just think about what feels like home."

What followed was the most extraordinary afternoon of Rhys’s life. It wasn't a recording session; it was an excavation of his own memory. Prompted by Ben’s gentle questions and his Mam’s occasional, delighted interjections from the sofa ("Oh, do you remember 'Calon Lân', love? You always used to sing that with your Auntie Val!"), Rhys began to unearth songs he hadn't consciously thought about in decades. He sang fragments of hymns, their soaring, hopeful melodies feeling strange and powerful in the sterile, soundproofed room. He sang melancholy ballads of lost loves and distant shores, his voice imbuing them with a weight of experience that went far beyond his own years. It was as if he was channelling generations of his heritage, a direct line to the colliers and the chapel-goers and the farmers who had sung these same songs in pubs and parlours and fields.

Ben was a master of his craft. He knew when to push, when to pull back, when to simply let the silence hang. He brought in a session musician, a quiet, bearded man named Phil who could play half a dozen instruments. Ben would have Rhys sing a melody, just a cappella, into the microphone. Then he and Phil would begin to build a world around it. A sparse, finger-picked acoustic guitar. A low, mournful cello drone. The gentle, pulsing rhythm of a bodhrán. They weren't producing tracks; they were framing portraits. Each arrangement was designed to serve the voice, to give it space to breathe, to showcase its inherent, unadorned beauty. For the first time, Rhys felt like a collaborator, not just a set of vocal cords for hire. The joy, the pure, simple joy of making music that had been his secret companion for so long, slowly began to return, no longer a guilty pleasure but a shared, creative act.

Late in the afternoon, Ben knew it was time to address the elephant in the room. "Okay," he said over the intercom. "We have to do it. The winning single. 'Delilah'." Rhys felt a familiar knot of tension return to his stomach. The song now felt like a costume he was being asked to put back on. But Ben’s approach was different this time. "Forget the Wembley version. Forget Tom Jones. Forget the arrangement. If this was just a poem you found, a story about a man driven mad by jealousy, how would you tell it? Sing it like you’re telling a secret in a dark room." Rhys closed his eyes. A secret in a dark room. That was a world he understood. That was the seventeenth floor. He nodded. Phil, the musician, swapped his guitar for a simple upright piano, and began to play a sparse, mournful chord progression, miles away from the bombastic brass of the original. Rhys stepped up to the microphone and began the story, his voice a near-whisper, full of a chilling intimacy. He wasn't a showman belting out an anthem; he was the man at the window, his heart breaking, his voice cracking with a quiet, desperate pain. The famous chorus, when it came, was not a roar of triumph, but a cry of utter desolation, the sound of a man at the very end of his tether.

When he finished, the silence in the control room was absolute. Cerys was staring at her brother through the glass, her expression one of utter astonishment, as if seeing him for the first time. Even his Mam seemed unsettled by the raw, dark power of the new interpretation. Ben let the final, dissonant piano chord fade completely before speaking, his voice hushed. "Jesus, Rhys," he breathed into the microphone. "That’s... terrifying. And beautiful. We're keeping that. That's the version." In that moment, Rhys understood. He didn't have to be the Crooning Cleaner. He didn't have to be the stadium rocker. He could take their songs, their expectations, and transform them into something that was his own. He had found a way to be himself, not by rejecting the machine, but by bending its rules to fit his own truth. It was a small victory, but it felt monumental. It was the first time since he'd answered the phone call from Chloe that he felt a genuine, unadulterated flicker of hope for the future.The days that followed melted into a strange, hermetically sealed passage of time. The recording studio became Rhys’s entire world, a soundproofed sanctuary from the gathering storm outside. The grey, minimalist decor, which had at first felt so cold and intimidating, began to feel like a welcome blank canvas. Here, inside this bubble of creativity, the frantic noise of his new life faded away, replaced by the pure, clean signal of music. The rhythm of his days was no longer dictated by the relentless sweep of a clock-hand counting down a shift, but by the search for the right harmony, the perfect take, the honest emotion. He, Ben, and the quiet, wizard-like multi-instrumentalist Phil, formed a small, self-contained tribe, communicating in a shorthand of nods, hummed melodies, and shared understanding.

His Mam and Cerys were a constant, grounding presence. They would arrive with him in the silent black car each morning and set up a small pocket of home in the corner of the futuristic control room. His Mam took up a semi-permanent residence on the plush leather sofa, a fortress of knitting needles and a flask of proper Welsh tea, her gentle presence a silent, unwavering vote of confidence. Cerys, armed with a stack of gossip magazines she read with ironic detachment, acted as his fiercely protective gatekeeper, fielding calls from Chloe and translating the increasingly demanding schedule into plain English. "They want you on some breakfast show tomorrow," she’d announce, looking up from an article about a soap star's disastrous holiday. "The one with the man who laughs like a seal. I told them you'd think about it, which means no." Her unapologetic belligerence on his behalf was a shield he hadn't known he needed, and he loved her for it. The contrast was stark and often surreal: inside the glass booth, Rhys would be pouring his soul into a heartbreakingly beautiful rendition of a centuries-old lament, while just a few feet away, his mother would be debating the merits of a new stitch pattern with the sound engineer and his sister would be arguing with a television booker about travel arrangements. This strange fusion of the mundane and the magical was what kept him sane. It prevented him from floating away entirely into the abstract, disembodied world of becoming a recording artist.

The album they were making was as unexpected and unvarnished as Rhys himself. It was a landscape of sound, full of rain and slate and damp, windswept hillsides. Ben, to his immense credit, fiercely protected its integrity. He fought battles Rhys never even knew about, pushing back against the label's suggestions for a "more upbeat, radio-friendly single" or a "guest spot from a big-name artist". "They don't get it," Ben would mutter after a tense phone call, running a frustrated hand through his hair. "They think they've signed a karaoke singer. They don't understand that they've signed a force of nature. Our job is just to build a frame and get out of its way." The music was sparse, allowing Rhys's voice to be the central character in every song. It was an album that demanded the listener lean in, an album that whispered more than it shouted, its power lying in its raw, unfiltered emotion. It was, Rhys realised with a dawning sense of pride, the sound of his own quiet life, finally given a voice.

This peaceful, creative incubation could not last. The machine that had claimed him demanded to be fed, and his first major public offering was scheduled for a week after his win: a primetime interview on the nation's most popular chat show. The night of the show, Rhys found himself in a dressing room that was colder and more sterile than any hospital waiting room. A slick, impossibly thin publicist named Sasha, who spoke in a rapid-fire volley of media-trained jargon, tried to prep him. "Okay Rhys, the key messages are: 'humble', 'grateful', 'living the dream'. If he asks about the money, we pivot to 'the music is the real prize'. If he asks about the cleaning job, it's a 'grounding experience that taught you humility'. Smile, be charming, and whatever you do, don't mention the bit about the advance. Got it?" Rhys just nodded, the words washing over him, feeling like he was being given a script for a play in which he was horribly miscast. He felt a familiar tightness in his chest, the same paralysis that had gripped him in the recording booth on that first day. He was being asked to perform a character – 'Rhys Price, The Crooning Cleaner' – and he had no idea how to do it.

He was led through the backstage labyrinth to the wings, the roar of the studio audience a familiar, terrifying sound. The host, a man with a tan that looked like it had been applied with an industrial sprayer and a smile that never quite reached his eyes, was in the middle of a gushing interview with a Hollywood actress. Rhys watched on a monitor, his heart thumping a heavy, clumsy rhythm against his ribs. The whole exchange felt utterly synthetic, a series of rehearsed anecdotes and performative laughter. This was the world he was now supposed to inhabit. Cerys had squeezed his hand before he’d left the dressing room. "Just tell the truth, you daft git," she'd whispered. "It's the only thing you're any good at." The thought was a tiny, flickering candle in the roaring wind of his anxiety. Then, he heard the host wrap up the previous interview and bellow his name. "He’s the man who went from pushing a mop to topping the charts! The voice of the valleys, the crooning cleaner himself… please give a huge welcome to Rhys Price!" He walked out into the blinding lights, his grandfather's suit feeling less like armour tonight and more like a borrowed costume.

He sat on the plush sofa, the studio audience a blur of cheering faces. The host leaned in, his professional bonhomie turned up to full volume. "Rhys, mate, fantastic to have you. Incredible story. One week you're cleaning toilets, the next you're the most famous man in Britain! Tell me, when you were down on your hands and knees scrubbing floors, did you ever, in your wildest dreams, imagine you'd be sitting here?" The question was exactly what Sasha the publicist had predicted. It was condescending, patronising, and designed to elicit the 'humble, grateful, living the dream' soundbite. The studio audience waited expectantly for the fairytale answer. Rhys looked at the host's gleaming, predatory smile, and something inside him, a quiet, stubborn thing forged in years of solitary work, refused to play the game. He thought of Cerys's advice. He took a breath. "No," he said, his voice quiet but clear, instantly cutting through the studio's artificial buzz. The host looked momentarily thrown. "No?" Rhys shook his head. "No. When I was cleaning floors, I was thinking about doing a good job. I was thinking about the squeak in my bucket wheel, and how it was always a C sharp. I was thinking about getting home before the sun came up so I could get a few hours' sleep. I wasn't dreaming of this." He gestured vaguely at the lights, the cameras, the audience. "This wasn't the dream. The dream was just... singing."

A strange silence fell over the studio. The host’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second. The answer wasn't in the script. It wasn't the triumphant narrative they wanted. But it was true, and its simple, unadorned honesty had a power that no rehearsed anecdote ever could. The host, a professional, recovered quickly. "And what a voice it is! We've all been talking about your new version of 'Delilah', it's already a huge hit. You've turned it into this dark, moody ballad. Why the change?" Rhys thought of the studio, of Ben's quiet encouragement to find the secret in the song. "Because it's a sad story," he said simply. "It's about a man who loses everything because of love and jealousy. It's not a party song. It's a tragedy. I just tried to sing the story as it's written." The host, sensing he was losing control of the narrative, tried to pivot back to safer ground. "Well, you're not losing anything, Rhys! You've won a hundred thousand pounds! You must be looking forward to a fancy holiday, a new car?" Rhys thought of the meeting with Julian and Alistair, of the thick, binding contract, of the prize money that was actually a debt. He looked directly into the camera, not the one pointed at him, but the main one, the one that was beaming his face into millions of living rooms, into his Mam's living room. "The first thing I'm going to do," he said, his voice steady, "is make sure my Mam's roof is fixed. It's been leaking for three years. And I'm going to buy my sister a new car, because hers keeps breaking down when she's trying to take my nephew to school. After that... I don't know. I'm just hoping I earn enough to pay the label back."

The interview ended shortly after that. As Rhys walked off stage, Sasha the publicist looked at him with a mixture of horror and awe, as if he'd just defused a bomb by singing to it. He fully expected a furious phone call from the label, a dressing-down for going off-script and revealing the uncomfortable truth about his prize money. But the public reaction was the opposite of what he'd expected. His raw, unpolished honesty had connected with people in a way no slick media campaign ever could. The clip of him talking about his Mam’s roof went viral. He was no longer just a fairytale character; he was a real person, a good son and brother who was navigating a bewildering new world with a quiet, stubborn dignity. The label, seeing the explosion of positive sentiment, was ecstatic. His authenticity, even his accidental revelation about the advance, had become his most marketable asset.

A few days later, walking back to the hotel after a long day in the studio, he saw it. On a newsstand, staring out from the cover of a glossy weekly magazine, was his own face. It was a picture from the TV interview, his expression serious, his eyes shadowed. Above his head, the headline screamed in huge, bold letters: 'THE £100,000 DEBT: The Secret Heartbreak Behind The Voice of the Valleys'. He stopped dead on the pavement, the noise of the traffic fading to a dull roar. He walked over and picked up the magazine, its flimsy, shiny paper feeling slick and unreal in his hands. They had taken his truth, his quiet confession about the realities of his contract, and twisted it into a sensationalist, melodramatic narrative of "secret heartbreak". They had turned his life into a commodity, his honesty into a sales pitch. Cerys's words came back to him with chilling clarity: *'You're not sure if you're a visitor or one of the exhibits.'* He put the magazine back on the rack, a cold, sinking feeling in his gut. The sanctuary of the studio was a temporary reprieve. The album was almost finished. And when it was done, he would have to step out of the quiet, creative bubble and fully become the man on that cover. He was an exhibit now, and the whole world was watching.The album, when it was finished, felt less like a product and more like a confession. They had called it ‘Seventeenth Floor’, a quiet nod to the secret world where Rhys’s voice had been born, a title so understated it was an act of defiance against the label’s marketing department, who had pushed for something more sensational like ‘The Cleaner’s Songbook’ or ‘From The Valleys’. The cover was a stark, black-and-white photograph Ben had taken of Rhys in the studio, not singing, but in a moment of quiet contemplation between takes, his eyes closed, his face etched with a profound weariness that was almost beautiful. On the day of its release, Rhys felt no sense of triumph, only a quiet, gnawing anxiety. He had poured the most private parts of himself onto that recording, the songs of his childhood, the grief for his grandfather, the lonely ache of his quiet life. Now it was being sent out into the world to be judged, consumed, and ultimately, priced. He, Cerys, and his Mam sat in his hotel room, the same one he’d been living in for weeks, and watched the digital sales chart on Cerys’s laptop, the numbers ticking over with a relentless, abstract momentum.

The success was immediate and overwhelming. It defied all industry predictions. In an age of autotuned pop and algorithm-driven hits, 'Seventeenth Floor' was a stark, acoustic anomaly. It climbed the charts with a speed that baffled the experts, propelled by the tidal wave of public goodwill from the show, but sustained by something deeper. The critics, who had been sharpening their knives for the inevitable manufactured reality-show winner’s album, were caught completely off guard. They didn’t know what to do with it. They wrote glowing, almost confused reviews, praising its "haunting authenticity," its "unvarnished emotional power," and its "startling intimacy." One influential broadsheet critic wrote, "This is not an album made by a television winner; it is an album made by an artist who just happened to be discovered on television. Rhys Price sings like a man who has lived a thousand years, his voice a direct line to a history of love and loss that feels both ancient and profoundly immediate." Ben read the reviews out loud, his face glowing with a vindicated, almost paternal pride. Rhys listened to the words – 'artist', 'authentic', 'profound' – and felt a strange, unnerving disconnect. They were describing a man he didn't recognise, a mythical figure of artistic integrity. He was just Rhys, who had sung some old songs he liked in a quiet room.

The real price of this success was paid not in pounds and pence, but in minutes and hours, in the relentless, grinding erosion of his own time and self. The sanctuary of the studio was dismantled, and he was thrown into the jaws of the promotional machine. His life became a blur of airport lounges, sterile radio stations, and television studios that all smelled of the same floor polish and stale coffee. His days were chopped into fifteen-minute interview slots, where he would be asked the same five questions over and over by a succession of journalists with varying degrees of sincerity. "What's it like to have your life change overnight?" "Are you still in touch with the other contestants?" "Tell us about your Mam's roof!" He developed stock answers, phrases he could deploy without thinking, his voice on autopilot while his mind drifted away, back to the quiet corridors of the Gwentfinity Tower. He learned to smile for the cameras, a strange, tight grimace that felt like a mask he was holding up to his face. He was constantly tired, a bone-deep exhaustion that no amount of sleep in a five-star hotel could fix. The joy of singing, which had been rekindled in the studio, was once again being buried, this time under an avalanche of obligation.

The money began to appear in his new bank account in staggering, incomprehensible sums. The first thing he did was transfer a huge chunk to Cerys's account with the simple note 'For the bus fare, and a new car, and everything else'. He arranged for a team of the best roofers in South Wales to descend on his mother’s terraced house, instructing them to fix not just the leak, but everything, to make it warm and safe and perfect for her. These were the moments that felt real, the tangible results of his strange new fame. But they were fleeting. The numbers in his bank account didn't make him feel rich; they made him feel anxious, the weight of them a constant, terrifying reminder of the new world he was in. He saw a financial advisor who talked about investments and tax shelters, and Rhys just nodded, feeling like a child in a parent-teacher conference, understanding nothing. He was wealthier than he had ever dreamed possible, yet he felt poorer than ever, robbed of the simple, priceless commodities of solitude and silence.

The breaking point came on a Tuesday morning in Manchester. He had been up since four a.m. for a breakfast television appearance, where he had been forced to participate in a lighthearted cooking segment with a celebrity chef, the awkwardness of him trying to chop an onion while being asked about his 'emotional journey' painful to watch. From there, it was a gauntlet of four back-to-back radio interviews, followed by an in-store album signing at a massive music shop. He stood behind a trestle table for two hours as a seemingly endless line of people snaked towards him. They were kind, their faces full of warmth and genuine affection. They told him their stories, how his music had touched them, how his performance had made them cry. They asked him to sign not just the album, but photographs, scraps of paper, even a prosthetic leg. He smiled, he thanked them, he wrote his name until his hand cramped into a claw. But with each signature, he felt a small piece of himself being given away, a tiny chip of his soul being traded for their adoration. He wasn't connecting with them; he was serving them, dispensing his persona in neat, autographed packages. By the time the last person had gone, he felt completely hollowed out, a vessel emptied of its contents.

Back in the sterile anonymity of his hotel room, he sat on the edge of the bed and stared at the wall, the sounds of the city traffic a muffled roar outside. His phone buzzed with a text from Chloe: 'Great work today! Big numbers from the signing. Car for Liverpool is at 7am.' Liverpool. Another city, another hotel, another round of the same interviews, the same questions, the same smiles. He felt a sudden, violent wave of rebellion rise in his chest. He couldn't do it. He simply couldn't get in that car in the morning. He stood up and began to pace the room, a caged animal looking for an escape. His gaze fell on his rucksack, the same battered bag he’d brought to London what felt like a lifetime ago. On impulse, he walked over to the desk, pulled up the National Rail website on his laptop – a sleek, expensive machine provided by the label, so different from his old, groaning computer. He typed 'Manchester Piccadilly' to 'Cardiff Central'. The journey time, the list of prices. It was all there. He could just go. He could get on a train and go home. To his small flat in Splott, to the smell of damp pavement, to a world where no one wanted anything from him. The thought was so powerful, so seductive, he could almost feel the rattle of the train beneath his feet. He was Rhys Price, the man who had won £100,000. He could do whatever he wanted. And what he wanted, more than anything in the world, was to run away. He reached for his phone, his thumb hovering over Cerys’s name. He needed to tell someone. But before he could press the button, the door to his room opened. It was Ben, the producer, his face etched with a familiar, weary concern. He was holding a takeaway bag that smelled of curry. "I thought you might want to skip the fancy room service tonight," he said, placing the bag on the table. "You looked like you were about to shatter into a million pieces back there." Rhys looked at Ben, at the laptop screen still displaying the train times to Cardiff, and the fight went out of him, replaced by a profound, aching weariness. He sank back onto the bed and put his head in his hands.Ben didn’t speak. He moved with a quiet, deliberate efficiency, clearing a space on the cluttered hotel desk amongst scattered newspapers and press schedules. He unpacked the takeaway curry from its paper bag, the rich, aromatic steam of garlic, ginger, and cumin filling the sterile room with a scent that was wonderfully, powerfully normal. He laid out two plastic containers of rice, a lamb rogan josh, a chicken tikka masala, and a paper-wrapped stack of naan bread. He did all this without once looking at Rhys, giving the man huddled on the edge of the bed the space and the silence he so clearly needed. It was an act of profound kindness, an offer not of advice or platitudes, but of simple, shared sustenance. A quiet declaration that, for the next twenty minutes, there were no expectations, no performances required.

Rhys finally lifted his head from his hands, his eyes red-rimmed and hollow. He looked at the feast laid out on the desk, then at Ben, who was now leaning against the wall, his arms crossed, waiting patiently. The unspoken understanding in the producer’s gaze was what finally broke him. "I can't do this anymore, Ben," he said, his voice a raw, defeated whisper that was swallowed by the thick hotel carpet. "I can't. I'm not… I'm not him. I'm not the man on the magazine cover. I'm not the story. And every time I have to pretend to be, I feel like a piece of me just… flakes off. There's not going to be anything left soon." He gestured helplessly towards the laptop, still glowing with the train schedule, an illuminated escape plan. "I was going to go home. Just get on a train and disappear. Go back to Splott. They can sue me. I don't care anymore. I just want to be quiet again."

Ben listened to the entire confession without flinching, his expression unchanging. He let the words hang in the air, giving them the weight they deserved. When Rhys was finished, Ben pushed himself off the wall and walked over to the laptop, glancing at the screen. He didn't close it. He just looked at the list of train times to Cardiff and nodded slowly. "I wouldn't blame you if you did," he said, his voice calm and even. "In fact, I'd probably do the same thing in your position. Most people would have cracked long before now." He gestured towards the desk. "Come on, let's eat before it gets cold. You can't run away on an empty stomach." He handed Rhys a plate, and the simple, human act of taking it felt like the first real choice Rhys had made all day. They sat in a companionable silence for a few minutes, the only sound the soft scrape of plastic forks against cardboard containers.

"This part," Ben said finally, gesturing with a piece of naan bread. "The relentless press, the TV shows where they ask you to chop vegetables, the signings where you feel like a performing seal… this isn't the job, Rhys. This is the launch. It's the rocket fuel. It's loud, it's violent, and it burns through you like hellfire. It's the worst part of it all, and it's designed to turn you into a product as quickly as possible." He took a bite of curry, chewing thoughtfully before continuing. "The label sees you as a story they can sell. The Crooning Cleaner. It's a great story. But it's a disposable one. What I saw in the studio, what we made together on that album… that's not a story. That's a career. That's the long game. This bit," he waved his fork around the room again, "this is just the price of admission to get to do the bit you're actually good at."

Rhys looked up from his plate, the food he'd been pushing around largely untouched. "But the singing… I can't even enjoy it anymore, Ben. Every time I open my mouth now, I feel like I'm trying to live up to something. I'm trying to be the man who won the show. I'm trying to be the voice the critics are writing about. The actual joy of it, the thing that I did for myself in the dark… it's gone. They've taken it, and they're selling it, and I don't know how to get it back." His voice cracked on the last few words, thick with a misery so profound it was almost tangible. He felt pathetic, a man who had been given the dream of a lifetime and was complaining that it was too much work, too much pressure.

Ben put his plate down, his expression turning sharp and focused. An idea was visibly taking shape behind his eyes. "So we take it back," he said, his voice suddenly full of a new energy. "We don't ask for permission. We just take it back." He stood up and began to pace, the creative excitement that Rhys recognised from the studio suddenly crackling around him. "Forget the schedule. Forget the big, soulless signings and the breakfast TV sofas. What if we cancel the rest of this junket? We tell them you're exhausted, on the verge of a breakdown, whatever. And instead, we do something real." He stopped pacing and turned to face Rhys, his eyes alight with the plan. "We go on tour. But not a proper tour. Not yet. No arenas, no big venues. We just get in a van, you and me and Phil, the guitarist. And we just… show up. Unannounced."

Rhys stared at him, confused. "Show up where?" Ben’s smile was conspiratorial and thrilling. "Anywhere. We find a pub in a little village in the Pennines. We find a miners' welfare hall in County Durham. We find a tiny, forgotten chapel on the coast of Pembrokeshire. We walk in, set up a speaker and a microphone, and you just sing. No lights, no promotion, no tickets. You sing the songs from the album, the old folk songs, whatever you feel like. For free. For whoever happens to be there. We film it on a simple camera, and we put it online. We remind people what they fell in love with. Not the story. Not the TV show. The voice. Your voice, in a real room, singing to real people."

A flicker of something long-dormant ignited in Rhys’s chest. It was a terrifying idea, chaotic and unprofessional and completely insane. And it was the most exciting thing he had heard in weeks. It was a plan that involved not performance, but connection. It was a way to bypass the machine, to go straight to the heart of the matter. It was a way to find the joy again, not by retreating into solitude, but by seeking out a different kind of communion. "You're mad," Rhys said, but for the first time in days, a genuine smile touched his lips. "The label would have a fit. Chloe would hunt you down and kill you with her clipboard." Ben grinned back, a reckless, brilliant flash of defiance. "Let her. My job is to deliver a successful artist, not a nervous breakdown. And right now, the most authentic thing our 'authentic artist' can do is rip up the script and go rogue. So, what do you say, Rhys? Do we get in the car to Liverpool tomorrow morning? Or do we hire a van, buy a road map, and go and find the soul of this thing again?"

Rhys looked from Ben's hopeful, excited face to the glowing laptop screen, where the 09:15 train to Cardiff Central was still waiting, a quiet promise of retreat and surrender. He could go home. He could crawl back into the shell of his old life, richer but more broken than when he had left. Or he could take this mad, terrifying leap of faith. He could try to become the artist Ben believed he was, not by playing the game, but by reinventing it. It was a choice between two kinds of fear: the fear of running away, and the fear of staying to fight on his own terms. He reached over and slowly, deliberately, closed the lid of the laptop. The glowing escape route vanished. "Where do we get a van at this time of night?" he asked.The question hung in the air of the silent hotel room, a spark thrown into a space full of flammable fumes. "Where do we get a van at this time of night?" For the first time in what felt like an eternity, the exhaustion on Rhys's face was eclipsed by a flicker of wild, terrified life. Ben’s conspiratorial grin widened into a triumphant slash. The despair in the room had instantly curdled into the electric, giddy energy of a prison break. This was no longer a breakdown; it was the beginning of an adventure. They were no longer the product and the producer; they were two co-conspirators about to commit an act of career sabotage that felt more like an act of salvation. The first call was to Phil, the quiet, bearded session musician. He answered on the third ring, his voice calm and unsurprised, as if he expected late-night calls about mad, career-altering schemes. Ben laid out the plan in a series of excited, breathless phrases – "rip up the schedule", "go rogue", "pub tour", "find the soul of it" – and at the end of the tirade, there was a long pause on the other end of the line. Rhys held his breath. Then Phil's dry, steady voice came back. "Right. So I should probably pack my mandolin as well as the guitar, then. Text me the address when you've got the van." He hung up. That was it. No questions, no arguments. Just the quiet, unwavering commitment of a true musician who valued the music more than the machine that sold it.

While Ben, now a whirlwind of frantic, joyous energy, hunched over his laptop, his fingers flying across the keyboard as he searched for '24-hour van rental, Manchester', Rhys was given his mission. He had to create the diversion, to throw the hounds off the scent. He picked up his phone, his thumb hovering over Chloe's name in his contacts. The lie came to him with a surprising, liberating ease. He typed: 'Chloe, feeling really unwell. Saw a doctor. Suspected exhaustion. Been told I need complete rest for a few days. Have to cancel Liverpool tomorrow. So sorry.' He read it over. It was plausible, professional, and just pathetic enough to be believed. It would buy them at least twenty-four hours before the label's concern curdled into suspicion and then outright panic. He pressed send, the message disappearing into the ether with a soft whoosh. It felt like cutting a rope that had been tied around his chest, each letter a snip of the shears. He was free, at least for a moment, and the feeling was so potent it made him dizzy.

Their escape from the five-star hotel was a hushed, clandestine operation conducted in the dead of night. Rhys ignored the expensive, label-provided suitcase and the designer clothes the stylists had given him. He packed his old, battered rucksack with a few changes of clothes, his toothbrush, and the worn copy of Dylan Thomas's poems his grandfather had given him. As he was about to leave, his eyes fell on the heavy golden trophy sitting on the desk. For a moment, he considered taking it, then stopped. It was the symbol of the win, but it was also the symbol of the cage. It belonged to the man on the magazine cover, not to him. He left it sitting there, a gleaming, silent rebuke to the world he was leaving behind. They crept down the service corridors, rode the staff elevator to the underground car park, and slipped out into the cold, silent city streets, feeling like fugitives from a life they had never asked for.

The van was a magnificent, inglorious beast. A white Ford Transit, slightly battered, smelling faintly of sawdust and builder’s tea. It was the absolute antithesis of the sleek, silent black cars that had been ferrying him around. Phil was already there, waiting patiently by a lamppost, a guitar case in one hand and a duffel bag in the other, looking for all the world like a man waiting for a bus. They piled in, Rhys taking the passenger seat, Phil and the equipment in the back. As Ben pulled the rumbling diesel engine out of the deserted industrial estate and onto the motorway heading north, Rhys felt a profound sense of release. The relentless, forward-moving pressure of his new life had been broken. For the first time in weeks, he didn’t know what was going to happen in the next twelve hours, let alone the next twelve months. The uncertainty was terrifying, and it was the most wonderful feeling in the world.

They drove north through the sleeping country, the van's headlights cutting a lonely tunnel through the darkness. The M6 was a river of red and white lights, each vehicle a private world, a story heading somewhere else. The atmosphere in the cab was warm, a bubble of quiet rebellion against the sleeping world. They didn’t talk much at first, content to listen to a collection of old folk albums Ben had on his phone – Nick Drake, John Martyn, Bert Jansch – the music a quiet, acoustic roadmap for the journey they were undertaking. "So," Rhys finally said, as the first grey hints of dawn began to silhouette the distant hills. "Where are we actually going?" Ben just smiled, his eyes on the road. "I have absolutely no idea. I thought we'd get off the motorway somewhere in the Yorkshire Dales. Find the smallest village on the map and see what happens." To Rhys, who had spent his life following schedules and clocking in and out, the complete lack of a plan was both exhilarating and deeply unsettling. He was a ship that had slipped its moorings, now at the mercy of the wind and the tide.

Hours later, they found themselves in a village that felt like it had been misplaced by time. Nestled in a deep, green valley, it was a tiny cluster of grey stone cottages, a crooked church spire, and a single pub, 'The Shepherd's Rest', from whose chimney a plume of woodsmoke curled into the crisp afternoon air. This was it. This was as far from Wembley as it was possible to get. They parked the van by the village green and walked towards the pub, the sound of their footsteps loud in the quiet air. The moment they pushed open the heavy oak door, all conversation inside stopped. A dozen pairs of eyes turned to look at the three strangers, their gazes a mixture of flat curiosity and deep-seated suspicion. The air inside was warm, thick with the smell of woodsmoke, damp wool, and stale beer. It was a private world, and they were intruders.

Ben, ever the diplomat, strode to the bar, his city clothes marking him out as an immediate outsider. "Afternoon," he said to the landlord, a formidable man with a face like a weathered cliff face. "Three pints of your best bitter, please. And I have a proposition for you." The landlord's eyebrows, which were formidable in their own right, rose a fraction of an inch. "I'm listening," he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. Ben laid it on the line, his voice calm and reasonable. "My friend here," he gestured to Rhys, who was trying to make himself as small as possible in the corner, "is a singer. A good one. We were wondering, if we bought a few rounds, would you let him sing a couple of songs for your regulars? No charge. Just for the love of it." The landlord stared at Rhys, his gaze taking in the weary lines around his eyes, his simple, unadorned clothes. He looked nothing like a singer. He looked like a man who'd had a long, hard day. The landlord grunted, a sound that could have meant anything. "He can sing for his supper," he said finally. "If he's any good, the pints are on the house. If he's rubbish, you're buying a round for the entire pub."

The challenge was laid. There was no backing out. A small space was cleared near the unlit fireplace, a single wooden stool placed in the middle. There was no stage, no microphone, no lighting rig. Just Rhys, his guitar, and an audience of twenty stone-faced farmers, shepherds, and dry-stone wallers, all of them sitting with their arms crossed, their expressions ranging from openly hostile to grudgingly curious. This was a harder crowd than Wembley. The Wembley crowd had wanted to love him. This crowd was daring him to impress them. His hands trembled as he perched on the stool. His throat was dry. The familiar panic began to rise. He looked to Ben, who gave him a small, encouraging nod from the bar. He looked down at the worn frets of the guitar. He took a breath. He didn't think of the stakes, or the deal with the landlord. He thought of his grandfather's garden.

He started, not with a big, belting number, but with the quietest song he knew. He began to finger-pick the gentle, rolling opening to 'Ar Lan y Môr'. And then he sang. The first note emerged soft and clear, a thread of pure, unadorned sound that seemed to weave itself into the smoky air of the pub. The voice, stripped of all amplification and studio gloss, was more potent, more immediate than ever. It was the sound of the landscape outside, of the rolling hills and the grey sky. It was a voice that understood silence, that knew the value of a single, perfectly placed note. Slowly, miraculously, the pub began to change. A man who had been loudly recounting a story to his neighbour fell silent mid-sentence. The clink of glasses behind the bar stopped. Pints were lowered to tables, their drinkers suddenly still, listening. The landlord, who had been polishing a glass with a surly expression, froze, his hands motionless, his gaze fixed on the quiet man in the corner. Rhys wasn't performing for them. He was offering them something, a piece of himself, a story woven from a shared history of sea and sky and longing.

The final, gentle chord faded into the crackle of the fire. For a moment, there was absolute silence, a silence so profound it felt more significant than any applause. Then, a man in the corner, a shepherd with a face as weathered as the landlord's, began to clap, a slow, deliberate, rhythmic sound. Others joined in, not a roar, but a warm, genuine wave of appreciation. The landlord nodded once, a gesture of profound, hard-won approval. "Not bad, lad," he grunted, the highest praise he was capable of giving. From the back of the room, a gruff voice called out. "Know any 'Wild Rover'?" Rhys looked up, a real, unforced smile breaking through his anxiety. He did. He knew it very well. He launched into the familiar, boisterous tune, and this time, a few of the regulars began to stamp their feet in time. By the third chorus, the whole pub was singing with him, their voices rough and out of tune and utterly, gloriously alive.

He played for more than an hour. He sang songs he hadn't sung in years, taking requests, telling the stories behind the lyrics, his initial terror melting away into a pure, uncomplicated joy. This wasn't a performance; it was a session, a sharing, a communion. This was the feeling he had been chasing, the magic he thought he had lost forever. When he finally finished, his throat raw and his fingers sore, the pub was a different place. The suspicion was gone, replaced by a rowdy, back-slapping camaraderie. Pints were pushed into his hand. Farmers wanted to talk to him about lambing season, not his 'emotional journey'. They didn't know who he was, and they didn't care. They just knew he was a good singer who knew the old songs. In the corner, Ben sat quietly, a small, discreet camera on the table in front of him, a wide, satisfied smile on his face. He caught Rhys's eye across the crowded, noisy room and raised his glass in a silent toast. Rhys, feeling warmer and more at home than he had in any five-star hotel, raised his pint back. He was exhausted, but it was the deep, satisfying exhaustion of honest work. The road ahead was still unknown, a blank map waiting to be filled in. But for the first time since this whole mad journey began, he felt like he was finally heading in the right direction.
