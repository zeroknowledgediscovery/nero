The sweat, a second skin, tasted of stale beer and desperation. Cassie Malone gripped the microphone stand, the cool metal a grounding rod against the lukewarm reception of the Tuesday night crowd at The Anvil. Her knuckles were white. The single spotlight felt less like a beacon and more like an interrogation lamp, bleaching the colour from the peeling paint on the wall behind her and illuminating the dust motes dancing in the fug of smoke and cheap perfume.

“So, the thing about Wollongong,” she said, her voice a practiced, gravelly drawl that belied the frantic thumping in her chest, “is that we live in a geographic paradox. We’ve got this endless, beautiful ocean telling us to go anywhere, be anything… and then we’ve got the escarpment. A giant, green, impassable wall that just screams, ‘Nah, you’re not going anywhere, mate. Finish your schooner and get back to the mill.’”

A ripple of laughter, thin but genuine, lapped at the stage. It was the good stuff, the laughter of recognition. It wasn't the big, booming laugh she got in Sydney when she played the inner-city clubs, a laugh that felt condescending, like they were appreciating a particularly rustic piece of folk art. This was the home crowd. They knew the wall she was talking about. They felt it every morning when the sun rose behind them, casting the mountain’s long shadow over the city.

She pushed on, the rhythm finding her now. “It’s like God was a property developer. He built this amazing beachfront property, then realised he’d forgotten the back fence. So he just threw up a mountain and called it a day. Left a few little gaps for the really determined possums and the occasional Subaru Forester, but the rest of us? We’re stuck here, admiring the view of the prison yard.”

More laughter. A bloke in a fluro work shirt near the front slapped the table, his appreciation loud and unvarnished. This was her bread and butter. The self-deprecating, cynical poetry of the Steel City. She was good at it. Everyone said so. Her mum kept a scrapbook of clippings from the local paper. *Malone’s Mirth a Must-See*. *Gong’s Queen of Quips*. It was a career. A real one. She paid her rent, mostly on time, telling jokes about seagulls stealing chips and the eternal smell of sulphur from the Port Kembla steelworks.

But tonight, the jokes felt like ash in her mouth. The laughter died down and the familiar silence rushed in to fill the void, a silence thick with the clinking of glasses and the low murmur of conversations she’d only momentarily interrupted. She saw her own reflection, distorted and ghostly, in the glass of the back bar fridge. A woman, thirty-two years old, hair pulled back in a messy knot, face pale under the light, holding a microphone like it was a lifeline. Is this it? The thought, unbidden and unwelcome, slithered into her mind. Is this the peak? A Tuesday night at The Anvil, making tired steelworkers chuckle into their Reschs?

She wrapped up the set, the last few jokes delivered on autopilot. The applause was polite, appreciative. She gave a little bow, a wry smile plastered on her face, and stepped out of the light. The darkness at the side of the stage was a relief, cool and anonymous. Barry, the owner, a man whose gut preceded him into any room by a good five seconds, handed her two drink tickets.

“Good one, Cass,” he grunted, his eyes already scanning the room for empty glasses. “Killed it.”

She didn't feel like she’d killed it. She felt like she’d performed a moderately successful séance, briefly summoning the ghost of a good time before it dissipated back into the ether. She traded one ticket for a gin and tonic, the ice a welcome shock against her hot skin, and found a shadowy corner to watch the next act set up. They were a band. Gutter Glitter. She’d heard of them, a three-piece punk outfit known for being loud, messy, and occasionally brilliant.

The drummer, a lanky kid with arms like pipe cleaners, thrashed out a chaotic fill. The bassist, a woman with a shaved head and a serene expression that didn't match the thunderous low-end rumble coming from her amp, laid down a groove that was felt more than heard. And then the singer-guitarist, Jez, stepped up to the mic. He was all wiry energy and nervous swagger, his cheap, battered guitar slung low.

He didn't speak. He just hit a chord. It wasn't a chord so much as an explosion of sound, a distorted, furious noise that ripped through the pub's comfortable chatter and made half the patrons jump. It was glorious. It was everything the polite laughter wasn't. It was a statement.

And then he started singing. Or rather, shouting. His voice was raw, tuneless, and utterly compelling. He sang about the same things she joked about – the rust, the boredom, the feeling of being penned in. But he wasn't asking for a laugh. He was screaming his defiance against it. He wasn't observing the wall; he was trying to tear it down with his bare hands, one dissonant power chord at a time.

Cassie stood frozen, the gin and tonic forgotten in her hand. The music was a physical force, a wave of pure, unfiltered emotion that washed over her. It was clumsy. It was chaotic. It was alive. She watched Jez, his eyes squeezed shut, spit flying from his lips as he howled into the microphone, and she felt a pang of something she hadn't felt in years. Not admiration. Envy. A deep, gut-wrenching, soul-crushing envy.

He wasn't telling a joke about the cage. He was rattling the bars.

The thought that had slithered in earlier now returned, but this time it had teeth. *Is this it?* No. It couldn't be. She didn't want to be the wry observer anymore, the clever woman with the punchline. She wanted to be the noise. She looked at the microphone Jez was abusing, then at the one she had so carefully placed back in its stand. They were the same object, but they were being used for entirely different purposes. Hers was a tool for translation, for packaging up angst and selling it as wit. His was a weapon.

The walk home was a blur of sodium lights and the distant, rhythmic sigh of the ocean. The industrial air, usually a comfort, felt thin and unsatisfying in her lungs. Her small apartment above a closed-down bakery smelled faintly of stale sugar and her own restlessness. She unlocked the door to find the main light on, and her brother Dave sitting at her tiny kitchen table, a Tupperware container in front of him.

“Thought you might be hungry,” he said, nodding at the container. “Mum made spag bol.”

Dave was a few years older, built like the girders he welded at the steelworks. Solid. Dependable. Unimaginative. He was the embodiment of the life she simultaneously mocked and envied for its stability. He had a mortgage, a wife who packed his lunch, and two kids who thought his comedy career was a baffling but amusing quirk, like a talking dog.

“Cheers, Dave,” she said, her voice sounding hollow in the small room. She slumped into the chair opposite him. The adrenaline from the gig had evaporated, leaving behind a gritty residue of discontent.

“Good set?” he asked, his hands resting on the table, calloused and capable.

“Yeah. Fine. The usual.”

He studied her face. For all his straightforwardness, Dave could read her better than anyone. “Just fine? You usually come back buzzing. Or pissed off about a heckler. You’re just… quiet.”

She stared at the Tupperware. Mum’s spag bol. The taste of her childhood, of a life laid out in neat, predictable portions. She took a deep breath, the air filling with the sound of a decision being made.

“I’m thinking of joining a band.”

The words hung in the air between them, strange and alien. Dave’s brow furrowed, not in anger, but in sheer, unadulterated confusion. It was as if she’d just announced she was taking up professional bullfighting.

“A band? What are you on about? Like, singing?”

“Yeah. Or shouting. Or something. I saw this band tonight, Gutter Glitter. And I just…” She trailed off, unsure how to explain the tectonic shift that had occurred within her in the last hour. “I want to do that.”

He let out a short, incredulous laugh. “Do what? Make a racket? Cass, you’re a comedian. A bloody good one. People pay to hear you talk, not to hear you screech over some racket.”

“It’s not a racket, Dave. It’s… energy. It’s real.”

“Real?” He gestured around her apartment, at the poster for one of her Sydney shows, at the stack of notebooks filled with her jokes. “What’s this, then? A fantasy? You’ve worked your arse off for this. You’re the funniest person in this whole damn city. You’ve got a good thing going. Why would you want to go and mess it all up to join some pub band that’ll probably break up in six months?”

*A good thing going*. The words were meant to be a compliment, a validation. But they landed like a punch to the gut. This thing she had, this life she had painstakingly built, joke by joke, gig by gig… he saw it as the finish line. For her, it had just become another wall.

“It’s not a good thing, Dave,” she said, her voice low and intense. “Not anymore. It’s a routine. It’s safe. And I’m so tired of being safe.”

He shook his head, a look of profound disappointment settling on his face. It was the same look he’d given her when she’d dropped out of her teaching degree. The look that said, *there she goes again, chasing butterflies*.

“Don’t get weird, Cass,” he said softly, his voice laced with a gentle, patronising concern that was worse than any anger. “Don’t chuck a good thing. Just… sleep on it. You’re probably just tired.”

He stood up, squeezed her shoulder, and let himself out, leaving the spaghetti bolognese on the table like a consolation prize. Cassie sat in the humming silence of her apartment, the echo of his words—*Don’t chuck a good thing*—ringing in her ears. It was the sensible advice. It was the loving advice. And it was the one thing she knew, with every fibre of her being, she was not going to do. The envy she'd felt watching Jez scream his lungs out had burned away the doubt. It had left behind a cold, hard resolve. She wasn’t just going to join a band. She was going to tear her safe, comfortable, ‘good thing’ of a life down to the foundations and build something new and loud and gloriously messy from the rubble. She just had to figure out how.She left the Tupperware on the table. The condensation beaded on the clear plastic lid, obscuring the familiar red sauce within. Mum’s spag bol. It was love, made edible. It was comfort. It was a weighted blanket for the soul. And right now, it felt like an anchor she had to cut loose. She picked up the container, walked to the bin, and dropped it in. The plastic thudded against the empty liner with a note of finality. She felt a pang of guilt, a daughter’s reflex, but it was quickly consumed by a colder, more exhilarating feeling. It was the first rule she had broken.

Sleep was a foreign country she couldn’t find the passport for. She lay in her bed, the sheets twisted around her legs, and stared at the ceiling where the headlights of passing cars painted long, slow stripes of light. Her own jokes, her well-honed routines, played on a loop in her head. They were clever, they were tight, they were dead. Each punchline landed with a dull thud in the silence of her room. She thought of Jez, his face contorted in a passionate scream, and the raw, unpolished truth of it. Her truth was polished to a high shine, so smooth that it offered no purchase, no real friction. She had spent years sanding down her own rough edges to make them palatable for a Tuesday night crowd.

She got up and found one of her notebooks, flipping past pages of scrawled set-lists and half-formed gags. The paper was clean, waiting. She tried to write something, anything, that felt like the noise in her head. *The mountain is a fist. The sea is a dare.* It was clunky, pretentious. It sounded like a bad Year 10 poem. Frustrated, she scribbled it out, the pen tearing through the thin page. It was one thing to want to be the noise; it was another thing entirely to know how to make it. The comedy had been a craft she could learn, a formula of setup and punchline. This new feeling had no formula. It was just a chaotic, churning need with no instruction manual.

The next day dawned grey and bruised, the sky the colour of old iron. Cassie skipped her usual morning routine—a run along the beach path, a coffee at her favourite cafe. The ocean’s endless horizon felt like a mockery, and the thought of exchanging pleasantries with the barista made her skin crawl. She needed to do something, to take a step that couldn't be taken back. She pulled on a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt, forgoing her usual slightly more put-together comedian ‘uniform’. She felt like she was putting on a costume for a person she wasn't yet. After a moment’s hesitation, she smudged dark eyeliner around her eyes, a clumsy, unpracticed gesture. When she looked in the mirror, a stranger stared back, looking both exhausted and vaguely dangerous. Good.

The Anvil looked pathetic in the daylight. The grime on the windows, invisible in the forgiving gloom of night, was stark and depressing. The lingering smell of stale beer was sharper, sadder. Inside, Barry was wiping down the bar, his movements slow and methodical. The stage was empty, the microphone stand back in its corner, looking like a skeletal piece of forgotten furniture. It was hard to believe the raw power of the previous night had happened in this sad, quiet room.

“Forget something?” Barry grunted without looking up, his rag making slow, wet circles on the sticky wood.

“No. I was just wondering about that band from last night. Gutter Glitter,” Cassie said, her voice sounding unnaturally loud in the empty pub.

Barry stopped wiping and finally looked at her, his eyes taking in her appearance with a flicker of mild surprise before settling back into their usual bored neutrality. “What about ‘em? They get paid. They don’t break anything. That’s all I care about.”

“I want to talk to them. The singer, Jez. Do you know where I can find them?”

He gave a short, humourless laugh that sounded like rocks grinding together. “Find them? Mate, they’re a punk band from the Gong, not the bloody Beatles. They probably crawled back under whatever rock they live under. Why? You got a complaint? Too loud for ya?” The question was laced with a faint, mocking amusement. The comedian, complaining about noise.

“No, it’s not a complaint,” Cassie insisted, trying to keep the desperation out of her voice. “I… I liked it. I want to talk to him about music.”

Barry squinted at her, a glimmer of genuine curiosity in his piggy eyes. He leaned his considerable weight against the bar and picked at something under his fingernail with a loose splinter from the counter. “You? You wanna talk music with Jez? He’s more likely to spit on you than have a conversation. Kid’s got a chip on his shoulder the size of the escarpment.” He seemed to consider this for a moment. “They practice in one of the old storage units down at the back of the Port Kembla workshops. The ones near the salt pans. You can probably hear ‘em from the main road. Sounds like someone’s torturing a shed full of cats.” He shook his head and went back to wiping the bar. “Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”The drive to Port Kembla was a journey into the city’s industrial gut. Cassie’s small car felt flimsy and out of place among the procession of hulking trucks barrelling towards the steelworks, their trays laden with coal or scrap metal. She left the pristine curve of the beaches behind, venturing into a landscape of smokestacks, railway lines, and rust-streaked warehouses that crouched under the shadow of the escarpment. The air grew thick and metallic, carrying the familiar sulphur tang she’d joked about a thousand times. Here, it wasn't a punchline; it was just the air you breathed. She followed Barry’s vague directions, turning down a road that ran parallel to a vast, shimmering expanse of salt pans, the crystallized ground cracked and white like sun-bleached bone. It was a desolate, alien landscape, beautiful in its own brutal way. This was the engine room of the city, the place that paid the bills and broke the backs, the source of both its pride and its pain.

Then she heard it. A faint, rhythmic throbbing that bled through the drone of the nearby industry. It was just as Barry had described: a frantic, tortured noise that grew louder and more distinct as she navigated a maze of dilapidated sheds and chain-link fences. It wasn’t a sound that invited you in; it was a sonic barrier, a warning. Yet she found herself steering towards it, her hands tight on the wheel. The noise resolved itself into drums, bass, and the electric scream of a guitar. It was messy and furious, but beneath the chaos was a desperate, undeniable pulse. A heartbeat. She parked her car near a row of identical, corrugated iron storage units, the paint flaking off them in leprous patches. The sound was coming from Unit 12, the number painted in faded, dripping red above a dented roll-a-door that was raised just enough to let a sliver of daylight and a torrent of noise escape.

For a long moment, she just stood there, the sound washing over her. It was so much louder out here, without the muffling effect of the pub walls and the bodies of the audience. It was a physical force that vibrated in her bones. Taking a breath that tasted of salt and industry, she crouched down and peered through the gap. The inside of the unit was a cramped, sweaty box, the walls plastered with torn posters and scrawled graffiti. Wires snaked across the concrete floor like trip-hazards. The drummer, the kid with the pipe-cleaner arms, was a blur of motion, his face screwed up in concentration. The bassist stood stock-still, a pillar of calm in the hurricane of her own making. And there was Jez, hunched over his guitar, his body contorting as he wrenched the chords from it. He wasn't performing; he was exorcising something. He was drenched in sweat, his cheap t-shirt clinging to his wiry frame. This wasn’t a rehearsal. It was a ritual.

The song crashed to an end, the final chord hanging in the air like a ringing in the ears before collapsing into feedback. The sudden silence was absolute, broken only by the drummer’s ragged panting. In that void, Cassie’s shadow, cast by the low sun, fell across the concrete floor. Three pairs of eyes snapped towards the opening. The drummer looked startled, the bassist impassive. Jez’s eyes, narrowed and hostile, found hers instantly. He straightened up slowly, letting his guitar hang from its strap. The swagger he had on stage was gone, replaced by a raw, confrontational stillness.

“What do you want?” His voice was flat, devoid of the performative fury of his singing. It was the voice of someone who expected trouble and was already tired of it.

Cassie stood up, her knees cracking. Her mouth was dry. All the sharp, clever words she used on stage had deserted her. “I… I saw you play last night. At The Anvil.” She felt foolish, like a fan at a stage door, which she supposed she was. “I’m Cassie.”

Jez wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his hand, his gaze unwavering and unimpressed. He didn’t offer a name in return. “Right. The comedian.” The way he said ‘comedian’ made it sound like an insult, a diagnosis of a terminal illness. “Come to tell us to turn it down? Writing some new material about the noisy neighbours?”

“No. Not at all.” The words came out in a rush. “I wanted to talk to you. About the band. About what you’re doing.” She gestured vaguely at the cramped, chaotic space. “I want in.”

The silence that followed this declaration was even more profound than the one after the song. The drummer let out a single, sharp bark of a laugh before Jez shot him a look that silenced him instantly. Jez took a step forward, his boots crunching on some unseen debris. He leaned down, his face now level with the gap in the door, his eyes boring into hers. They were a startling, pale blue, full of a weary, cynical intelligence.

“You want in?” he repeated, his voice dangerously soft. “In what? In the band? Lady, this isn’t a book club. We’re not looking for new members. Especially not… a stand-up comedian.” He looked her up and down, taking in the clumsy eyeliner and the clean jeans. “You get your little laughs talking about how shit it is here. It’s your bit. Your shtick. For us, it’s not a fucking shtick. You think this is a game? You think you can just put on a black t-shirt and play at being angry for a while before you go back to your clever little jokes? Piss off.”

His dismissal was so complete, so contemptuous, it felt like a physical slap. Every insecurity she’d felt over the last twenty-four hours crystallised into a hot, painful lump in her throat. Her brother’s words, Barry’s words, Jez’s words—they were all saying the same thing. Stay in your lane. You don’t belong here. The old Cassie would have made a joke, deflected the hostility with a wry comment and retreated, preserving her dignity. But the old Cassie wasn’t here anymore. The envy that had consumed her the night before flared into anger.

“You think I don’t know it’s not a shtick?” she shot back, her voice lower and harder than she’d intended. She crouched down again, bringing her face close to his. The air between them was thick with the smell of sweat and electricity. “You think your cage is any more real than mine? We’re talking about the exact same wall, you and I. The only difference is, I make people laugh so they can forget about it for five minutes, and you scream so they have to look at it. Don’t you dare tell me I don’t get it. My jokes are just screams with a better sense of timing.”

Jez didn’t flinch. He just watched her, his expression unreadable. The fire in her words seemed to surprise him, or at least interest him more than her initial fumbling request. For the first time, he looked at her not as ‘the comedian,’ but as a person. He saw the genuine, desperate frustration in her eyes. He was quiet for a long time, the only sound the distant groan of machinery from the steelworks. The bassist and the drummer just watched, silent witnesses to the standoff.

Finally, he pushed himself away from the door and straightened up. “Noise is easy,” he said, his voice back to its flat, dismissive tone, though the venom was gone. “Anyone can make noise. You got something to say?” He kicked at a crumpled sheet of paper on the floor. It was covered in angry-looking scrawl. “You want in? Show me. Don’t tell me. Write something. Not a routine. Not a setup and a punchline. Words. For this.” He gestured with his chin at the chaotic room, at the instruments, at the very air thrumming with residual energy. “Bring it back here tomorrow. If it’s not shit, we’ll talk. If it is, don’t bother coming back.” He turned his back on her then, picking up his guitar as a clear signal of dismissal. “Now get out of our light. We’re practicing.”The walk of shame back to her car was worse than any bad gig. Jez’s dismissal echoed in her head, each word a perfectly aimed stone hitting the fragile new thing she was trying to build inside herself. *Piss off.* The casual, brutal finality of it. She drove away from the salt pans and the screaming shed with her knuckles white on the steering wheel, the same way they’d been on the microphone stand. Back then, it was nerves. Now, it was rage. A hot, furious anger at him, for his arrogant gatekeeping, but also at herself, for being so easily read, so transparently a tourist in this territory he claimed as his own. The smokestacks of the steelworks pumped grey plumes into the evening sky, and for the first time, she didn't see a backdrop for a joke. She saw a series of colossal, indifferent middle fingers pointed at the heavens.

Her apartment was no longer a refuge; it was the scene of the crime. Her crime of complacency. The poster for *Malone’s Mirth* on the wall seemed to mock her, the smiling, confident woman in the photo a stranger she wanted to punch. She swept the stack of comedy notebooks off her desk with a clatter, sending years of carefully constructed wit scattering across the floorboards. They were useless to her now. A foreign language. She sat at the empty table, a single clean sheet of paper in front of her, a pen in her hand. *Write something,* he’d said. *Words. For this.* And the "this" was the noise, the rage, the city's grinding heart. She put the pen to paper. Nothing. Her mind, so adept at finding the clever angle, the surprising twist of phrase, was a perfect, barren vacuum. The muscle she’d trained for a decade was the wrong one for this job. You couldn't be witty about a scream.

Hours bled into one another. She made coffee that went cold, paced the small confines of her living room until she’d worn a track in the cheap rug, and stared out the window at the quiet, sleeping street. She tried thinking about the escarpment, but all that came out were tired metaphors she’d already used on stage. She tried thinking about the ocean, and found only greeting-card platitudes. She was a tour guide to her own life, pointing out the landmarks without ever really living in them. Jez wasn't a tour guide. He lived in the engine room, covered in the grease and the grime of it, and he’d smelled the clean, sanitised scent of the observation deck on her from a mile away. The frustration was a physical thing, a tightening in her chest, a sour taste in her mouth. She was a fraud. A comedian who had lost her sense of humour and a writer who had no words.

Then, she stopped trying to write about the mountain or the sea. She stopped trying to write for Jez, or for some imaginary punk rock audience. She closed her eyes and thought about the look on Dave’s face. That gentle, loving, suffocating pity. *Don’t chuck a good thing.* The phrase wasn't a warning anymore; it was a threat. She thought of the polite, thin laughter from the Tuesday night crowd, the sound of people mildly amused, not moved. The sound of settling. She thought of her reflection in the bar fridge, a pale ghost holding a microphone like a crutch. She thought of the silence after the laughter dies. The gnawing, terrifying silence where the thought *Is this it?* lived and bred. She picked up the pen, and this time she didn’t think. She wrote.

The words didn't flow. They tore their way out, ugly and misshapen. She wasn’t crafting sentences; she was documenting a feeling. The pen scratched and stabbed at the page. She scribbled out lines, drew angry arrows, and wrote over her own words until the page was a battlefield. She wrote about the taste of stale beer and desperation being her own, not some character's. She wrote about the smile that felt like a mask hardening on her face. She wrote about the scrapbook of clippings feeling like a beautiful, ornate tombstone. She wrote about the kindness that felt like a cage and the laughter that sounded like the rattling of keys. It was disjointed. It was personal. It was vicious. It was the truest thing she had ever written.

When she finally stopped, her hand was cramped and the sky outside was beginning to pale from black to a deep, bruised purple. A single sheet of paper lay on the table, brutalised with ink. She read it over, her heart hammering against her ribs. There were no punchlines. There was no clever wordplay. It was a raw nerve, exposed and twitching on the page. It was a list of grievances against a life that everyone, including herself, had agreed was a ‘good thing’. Reading it felt like peeling a scab off a wound she hadn’t known was so deep. It was terrifying. And it was exactly what Jez had asked for. She folded the paper twice, the creases sharp and decisive, and slid it into the back pocket of her jeans.

The next afternoon, she didn't bother with the eyeliner. She didn't change her clothes from the day before. The exhaustion she felt was real, not a costume, and she wore it like armour. The doubt was a constant, cold hum beneath her skin. This was insane. She was a comedian about to show a page of her darkest, most incoherent thoughts to a hostile punk singer who had already told her to piss off. He would laugh at her. He would read it, sneer, and toss it on the filthy concrete floor. It was a final, spectacular act of self-humiliation. And yet, she kept walking. She parked in the same spot, the industrial air feeling less like an accusation and more like a conspiracy she was now part of.

The noise was already coming from Unit 12, a furious, repetitive riff being hammered into shape. It was the sound of something being built, or possibly demolished. She walked towards it, the folded paper in her back pocket a small, dense weight against her. Her stomach churned. This was it. The point of no return. Her old life, the ‘good thing’, was behind her. What lay ahead was a roll-a-door raised just enough to admit a sliver of light, and the possibility of a spectacular, unfiltered failure. She reached the door, the noise a physical wall of sound, and hesitated for only a second. Then, without crouching, without peering, she got down on her hands and knees and slid the folded piece of paper across the dusty concrete, into the heart of the noise. It skittered to a stop near Jez’s boot. Then she stood up, brushed the grit from her palms, and waited.The music didn't stop. For a full minute, the brutal, repetitive riff continued unabated, a sonic meat grinder that seemed to have chewed up her flimsy offering and spit it out the other side. She could feel a flush of humiliation creeping up her neck. Of course. What had she expected? That they’d halt their sacred ritual for a piece of litter? She had just started to turn, to make the long, defeated walk back to her life, when the riff faltered. It stumbled for a beat, then collapsed into a squall of feedback as a guitar string was abruptly muted. The ensuing silence was heavier and more absolute than it had been the day before. It was a silence that knew she was there.

Through the gap at the bottom of the door, she saw Jez’s worn leather boot take a single step forward. He bent down, his back to her, and his hand disappeared from view. When he straightened up, the folded piece of paper was in his fingers. He held it for a moment, as if weighing it. The drummer, Mac, had his sticks poised over his snare, his mouth slightly agape. The bassist, Lena, had not moved a muscle, but her dark, calm eyes were fixed on Jez. He unfolded the paper slowly, deliberately, his movements radiating a kind of theatrical contempt. He held it up in the dim light filtering through the grimy window high on the wall. Cassie held her breath, her entire future seeming to hinge on the tilt of this angry stranger’s head.

He read it. His eyes, which had been narrowed in suspicion, widened almost imperceptibly as they scanned the page. He didn’t sneer. He didn’t laugh. A muscle in his jaw tightened, the only outward sign of any reaction at all. He read it a second time, more slowly, his head cocked slightly. The paper, her soul-baring, desperate manifesto, looked small and pathetic in his hand. When he finished, he refolded it with the same sharp creases she had made and looked towards the gap in the door. He didn’t speak for a long time. The air grew thick with unspoken judgment. Cassie’s heart was a frantic, caged bird in her chest.

“Lift it,” Jez’s voice was a low command, directed not at her but at Mac. The drummer scrambled to his feet, fumbled with the chain, and with a deafening rattle and screech of protesting metal, heaved the roll-a-door upwards. It stopped at chest height, creating a dark, unwelcoming mouth. The full force of the room’s smell hit her—stale sweat, hot electronics, and the faint, acrid scent of ozone from a struggling amp. Jez stood in the centre of the room, her piece of paper still in his hand. He gestured with his head. It was an order, not an invitation. “Get in.”

Cassie ducked under the heavy door, stepping from the flat grey light of the industrial park into the claustrophobic twilight of the storage unit. The space was even smaller and more chaotic up close. Empty cans and bottles littered the corners, and the walls were a tapestry of peeling band posters and graffiti tags. It felt like the inside of a teenager’s skull. Mac retreated to his drum kit, looking at her with a kind of nervous, bird-like curiosity. Lena gave her a slow, deliberate nod, a gesture that was neither friendly nor unfriendly, merely an acknowledgement of her presence. Jez hadn’t moved. He was watching her, his expression a mask of neutrality that was somehow more intimidating than his earlier hostility.

“You wrote this,” he stated. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes,” Cassie’s voice was a dry rasp.

He tossed the paper onto the top of a large, buzzing amplifier. “I don’t give a shit what’s on a piece of paper. Say it.”

Cassie stared at him, confused. “Say what?”

“That.” He jabbed a finger at the folded paper. “I want to hear it. Not your stage voice. Not your practiced timing. I want to hear you say the words.”

This was a new kind of test. A new kind of interrogation lamp. She was a performer, but her whole performance was built on the armour of the joke, the safety net of the punchline. This was asking her to stand naked in the middle of this hostile room and bleed. She swallowed, the lump in her throat feeling large and sharp. She looked from Jez’s unwavering stare to Lena’s impassive face to Mac’s wide, waiting eyes. There was no escape. She took a breath, unfolded the paper, and her own handwriting looked alien to her. Her hand trembled, but she forced it still.

She started to read. Her voice, at first, was thin and shaky, the voice of a stranger. “The sweat, a second skin… tastes of my own stale beer, my own desperation.” The words she’d written in the lonely dark of her apartment sounded different here, amplified by the tension in the small room. “The smile is a plaster cast… it hardens. You forget the shape of your own face underneath.” She gained momentum, the rhythm of the words finding her, a different rhythm to the one she knew. It wasn't the rhythm of a joke, but of a pulse. “They keep my name in a scrapbook… a pretty tomb for a girl who tells jokes. A good thing. A safe thing. A quiet death by a thousand chuckles.”

She looked up from the page. She was no longer reading. The words were in her now, etched onto the back of her eyeballs. Her voice grew stronger, rougher, losing its careful modulation and taking on a serrated edge. “You think your cage is more real than mine? Mine is just prettier. It’s painted in polite applause. It’s furnished with drink tickets and the loving concern of people who want me to be safe.” Her eyes locked with Jez’s. “I’m not rattling the bars. I’m swallowing the key. I’m setting the whole fucking pretty cage on fire.”

She finished, her last words hanging in the buzzing air like smoke. She was breathing heavily, the paper crinkled in her clenched fist. The silence that followed was different again. It wasn't empty or judgmental. It was full. It was the silence of a held breath, of a chord waiting to be struck. Mac’s mouth was still open, but his expression had changed from curiosity to something like awe. Lena’s serene face had broken into the faintest hint of a smile, a crack in the porcelain.

Jez took the crumpled paper from her unresisting fingers, smoothed it out, and placed it back on the amp. He walked back to his position and picked up his guitar. He looked at her, his pale blue eyes stripped of their earlier contempt, replaced by a raw, focused intensity she recognized from his performance on stage. He’d seen her. He’d finally, truly seen her.

“Again,” he said, his voice a low rasp. “But louder.”“Louder?” Cassie croaked, her throat already feeling scraped raw from the first reading. The word came out as a pathetic squeak. The idea of projecting her voice further felt physically impossible, an absurd demand. She had spent a decade honing a voice for intimacy, for drawing a crowd in with a conspiratorial whisper, not for blasting them against the back wall. She didn’t have a ‘louder’.

Jez’s face was stone. He hit a single, brutal, open string on his guitar. The note was a jolt, a cattle prod to her nervous system. It wasn't musical; it was pure, percussive command. “I didn’t say prettier. I didn’t say sing it. I said louder. I want to hear it from over here. I want to hear it over this.” He hit the string again, harder this time, letting the note sustain, a belligerent whine that filled every corner of the room. “Now.”

Something in his unyielding stubbornness broke the dam of her fear. It wasn't a choice anymore. It was a dare. Her own words came back to her: *I’m setting the whole fucking pretty cage on fire.* This was the match. She took a breath, not a delicate performer’s breath from the diaphragm, but a deep, ragged gasp that hurt her lungs. She closed her eyes, shutting out their faces, and focused on the burning knot of frustration and rage that had lived in her gut for years. She wasn't reading lines anymore. She was testifying.

“THE SWEAT,” she roared, the sound ripping from her throat, shocking her with its volume and its ugliness. It was a raw, tuneless bellow, the sound of something breaking. Jez hit a chord, a distorted, snarling power chord that met her voice in the air and wrestled with it. The combination was hideous and thrilling. She pushed on, her voice cracking and splitting. “THE SMILE IS A PLASTER CAST! IT HARDENS!” Mac, catching the rhythm of her words, slammed down on his snare and cymbal, a gunshot punctuation. Lena’s bass kicked in, not a melody but a low, gut-punching throb that vibrated up through the soles of Cassie’s cheap sneakers and anchored her to the floor.

She was in the eye of the storm. The noise was a physical entity, a whirlwind of furious energy that she was somehow conducting. The paper was forgotten in her hand. The words poured out of her, fueled by the sonic chaos erupting around her. She screamed about the scrapbook, about the polite laughter, about the loving concern that felt like a chokehold. It wasn't poetry. It was an indictment. She was no longer a person standing in a room; she was a conduit for a lifetime of swallowed anger, and it was finally, gloriously, coming out. She screamed until her lungs burned and black spots danced in her vision, ending on the final line, her voice shredding completely, “ON FIRE!”

The band crashed down with her, a final, cataclysmic collision of sound that shuddered through the thin metal walls of the unit and then died, leaving behind only the high-frequency hum of the amps and the sound of her own ragged, desperate breaths. She swayed on her feet, dizzy and nauseous. Her throat felt like she’d swallowed glass. She opened her eyes. The room was the same, but everything had changed. Mac was leaning over his drum kit, panting, a wide, incredulous grin on his face. Lena was watching Cassie, and the faint smile from before had deepened, her head giving another slow, approving nod.

Jez lowered his guitar. He walked over to the amp, picked up a bottle of water, and tossed it to her. Cassie fumbled the catch, her hands shaking. “Practice is Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Seven o’clock. Don’t be late,” he said, his voice as flat and business-like as if he were giving her a shift schedule. He turned to the others. “Again. From the top. Lena, that low-end is too muddy. Mac, stop trying to get fancy, just hit the fucking thing.” It was the most profound acceptance she could have imagined. There was no praise, no welcome hug. There was just the work. She was in.

She stumbled out from under the roll-a-door into the late afternoon light, which felt unnaturally bright and silent. The world outside the shed seemed muted, washed out, a film running at the wrong speed. She leaned against the cool, corrugated wall of the next unit over, taking deep gulps of the salty, metallic air. Her entire body thrummed with a residual, high-voltage energy. She touched her throat gingerly. It was on fire, a deep, satisfying ache. It was the best she had felt in years. She had made a noise, a horrible, beautiful, honest noise, and the silence that followed it wasn’t empty. It was charged with possibility.

The drive back to her apartment was a daze. The familiar landmarks of her city looked alien, as if she were seeing them for the first time without the filter of her routines. The escarpment wasn’t a punchline anymore; it was just a mountain. The ocean wasn’t a metaphor for escape; it was just the sea. She was drained, hollowed out, but in the emptiness, something new had taken root. She unlocked her apartment door. The poster of her smiling face seemed more pathetic than ever. Without a second thought, she walked over, ripped it from the wall, tore it in half, and dropped the pieces into the bin on top of the Tupperware container. It felt like shedding a skin.

Her phone buzzed on the kitchen table. The screen lit up with a picture of her brother grinning, holding up a ridiculously oversized fish. *Dave*. Of course. She let it ring, the cheerful, chirping sound an intrusion from a world she no longer entirely belonged to. It stopped, then buzzed again with a text message. *You okay? Sounded weird on the newsagent’s answering machine. Mum’s worried.* She stared at the message. She’d forgotten she was meant to pick up her mother’s prescription. Another small, broken rule in a day full of them. She picked up the phone, her thumb hovering over the call button. What could she possibly say? How could she explain the beautiful, terrible noise she had just made, or the fact that she wanted to spend the rest of her life chasing it? She typed a reply, her fingers feeling clumsy. *Sorry. Lost track of time. Am fine. Just tired.* It was a lie, but it was also the truth. She was more tired, and more awake, than she had ever been.The next morning, she woke up to a throat full of broken glass. The simple act of swallowing sent a wave of razor-sharp pain from her jaw to her collarbone. For a moment, disoriented in the grey morning light, she thought she was sick, the kind of brutal flu that laid you out for a week. Then the memory of the storage unit crashed back into her—the roar of the guitar, the smell of sweat and ozone, the feeling of her own voice tearing its way out of her chest. This wasn't sickness. This was a receipt. Proof of purchase for a single, glorious moment of noise. She lay still, exploring the contours of the pain, a deep, satisfying ache that was both a punishment and a reward. Her apartment was silent, but the ringing in her ears from the amplifier was a phantom limb, a constant, high-frequency reminder of where she had been.

She swung her legs out of bed and walked to the bathroom, her movements stiff. The woman in the mirror was a wreck. Her eyes were shadowed with exhaustion, her hair was a tangled mess, and there was a new, feral tension around her mouth. She opened her lips to say something, anything, just to test the damage. No sound came out. Not a whisper. She tried again, pushing air from her lungs, and was rewarded with a dry, rasping hiss, like sandpaper on wood. A flicker of panic shot through her, the professional’s terror of losing their instrument. For a comedian, a voice was everything. But she wasn't that comedian anymore, was she? The panic subsided, replaced by a strange, grim satisfaction. She looked at her ravaged reflection and saw not a liability, but a transformation in progress. The smooth, reliable tool had been broken, and maybe that was the only way to reforge it into a weapon.

The flashing light of her phone on the kitchen table could not be ignored forever. It pulsed with a frantic, familial urgency. Fifteen missed calls from Dave, seven from her mum. A string of texts escalating from confusion to outright alarm. She knew she couldn't text back forever; it would only fuel their panic. Taking a deep breath and bracing for the pain, she pressed the call button next to Dave's name. He answered on the first ring, his voice a torrent of anxious relief. “Cass? Jesus, finally! Are you alright? Mum’s about to call the cops. What the hell’s going on?” She tried to form a word, to say ‘I’m fine,’ but all that emerged was a pathetic, airy croak. The silence on the other end of the line was immediate and heavy. “Cassie? What was that? Are you crying? Did something happen?” His concern was so genuine, so pure, it felt like a physical weight pressing down on her. She tried again, forcing the sound, and managed a hoarse, painful whisper. “Throat… sore.” It was the most pathetic explanation imaginable. “Sore throat? You sound like you’ve been gargling gravel. What did you do?” She couldn't tell him. She couldn't say, *I’ve joined a punk band and I was screaming my guts out in a shed in Port Kembla*. It was a sentence from a different language, a different universe. “Just… sick,” she whispered, each word an agony. The lie tasted foul, but the truth was impossible. There was a long pause, and when Dave spoke again, the anxiety in his voice had been joined by a familiar, weary disappointment. “Right. ‘Sick’. I’ll tell Mum. Get some rest, I guess.” He didn’t believe her. He knew this was part of the ‘weirdness’ he’d warned her about, and his loving withdrawal was a sharper pain than anything in her throat.

Tuesday evening arrived with a sense of grim inevitability. She had spent the day in a state of suspended animation, sipping lukewarm honey tea, her vocal cords a constant, throbbing reminder of the commitment she had made. The thought of backing out was a seductive whisper in her mind. She could call it a day, rest her voice, and be back on stage at The Anvil by next week, her strange outburst a story she could one day turn into a self-deprecating anecdote. A good thing going. The phrase was a ghost at the feast. But the memory of the noise, of the raw, unfiltered connection in that room, was stronger. She pulled on her jeans and a faded black t-shirt, the uniform she was slowly growing into. In her bag, she packed a bottle of water, a pen, and a new, clean notebook, its blank pages both a promise and a threat. She didn’t know what was expected of her. She was just a comedian with no voice and one page of angry poetry to her name.

The noise from Unit 12 was already a solid wall of sound before she was even halfway down the access road. It was different this time; they weren't just jamming. They were working on something, a frantic, stop-start rhythm that would build to a crescendo and then abruptly cut off, followed by a moment of silence and then Jez’s sharp, barking corrections. She ducked under the half-raised door, her stomach a cold knot of dread and anticipation. The three of them were drenched in sweat, locked in a state of intense, combative concentration. Jez didn't acknowledge her arrival with a word, just a flick of his eyes that said, *You’re here. Good. Don’t get in the way.* She found a spot against the wall, out of the tangle of cables, and just watched, feeling like an anthropologist studying a newly discovered tribe. The way they communicated was brutal and efficient, a shorthand of insults, gestures, and shared glares. Mac would miss a fill, and Jez would stop playing mid-chord. "Are you having a stroke, or is that a new beat you invented?" Lena would shake her head, play a short, corrective bass line, and Mac would nod, count them in, and they’d crash back into it, tighter this time. It was a hostile environment, but it was ferociously productive. This wasn’t a hobby; it was a job, and the work was hard.

After twenty minutes of this relentless fine-tuning, Jez finally stopped and gestured at her with the neck of his guitar. “Alright. The words.” He pointed to the crumpled paper from their first meeting, which was still sitting on his amp like a holy relic. “We need more of that. And we need to make it a song, not a diary entry.” He walked over and stood in front of her, crossing his arms. The confrontational energy was back. “Got anything else, or was that a one-off?” Cassie’s heart hammered. She hadn’t written a single new word. The well was dry. She shook her head, and managed to rasp, “Not yet.” His eyes narrowed. “Not good enough. This isn't a university poetry class where you wait for the muse to strike. You dig it out. You come here with pages, not excuses.” He tapped the side of his head. “This is the engine. The noise is just the exhaust. Your job is the fuel. No fuel, no fire.” He turned away from her and looked at Lena. “Let’s try and build something out of the first one.” Lena nodded, and began to play a slow, menacing bass line, a dark, circular riff that pulsed with a feeling of coiled tension. It was the perfect sound for the words Cassie had written. It was the sound of her own restless pacing distilled into four notes.

Jez layered a guitar melody over the top, a clean, arpeggiated line that was surprisingly melodic, almost beautiful, a stark contrast to the distorted fury he usually played. Mac joined in with a simple, hypnotic beat on the hi-hat and snare. A song was beginning to form, an actual piece of music emerging from the chaos. Jez looked at Cassie. “Okay. Do the thing. Your words. On top of this.” It was her cue. She took a sip of water, the liquid a brief, cool relief on her ravaged throat. She looked at the music happening in front of her. It was slower, more atmospheric than she expected. Her rage-fuelled scream from the audition wouldn’t fit. This required something else. A different texture. She took a breath and tried to speak the first line, to find a place for it in the rhythm Lena and Mac were laying down. But her voice was gone. Only a strangled, airy rasp came out, completely lost in the sound of the band. She tried again, pushing harder, and the rasp became a painful, off-key croak. It was useless. She couldn’t be heard. The band played on, waiting for her, the space where her voice was supposed to be a gaping, embarrassing hole in the fabric of the song. Frustration and shame burned in her chest, hotter than any fury. She was an imposter. A tourist who had talked her way into the cockpit of a fighter jet and now had no idea how to fly.The music ground to a halt. Not with a crash, but with a slow, discordant decay as each member gave up. Lena’s bass line was the last to die, its final note hanging in the air for a moment before she silenced the string with the side of her hand. The silence that rushed in was not charged or electric; it was dead. It was the flat, awkward silence of a joke with no punchline. Mac stared down at his snare drum as if it had personally betrayed him. Jez didn't even look at her. He just stood with his back to her, head bowed, the very picture of disgust. He slowly placed his guitar into its stand with a kind of exaggerated, weary care, the movements of a man dealing with a profound and irritating disappointment.

“Get out,” he said, his voice quiet and utterly final. He still hadn't turned around.

The two words hit her with more force than his loudest scream. They were an execution, delivered without anger, without passion, just a cold, flat dismissal. The fragile, embryonic hope that had been growing in her chest for forty-eight hours shrivelled and died. The shame was a physical heat that flooded her face and neck. This was it. The spectacular, unfiltered failure she had courted. She had been given her chance and she had shown up broken. An amateur. A tourist.

She turned to leave, to duck back under the roll-a-door and disappear into the anonymity of the industrial park, to crawl back to a life that at least had a script. But as she moved, a fresh wave of fury, directed entirely at herself, surged through her. She was not going to leave like this. She was not going to be dismissed like a child who had failed a simple test. Her voice was gone, but she was not mute. Her wit was her weapon, but her anger was her power, and it was the only thing she had left.

Instead of walking towards the exit, she strode past Jez, snatched the new notebook and pen from her bag, and slammed it down on top of a speaker crate. In big, jagged letters, stabbing the pen so hard she tore the paper, she wrote: MY THROAT IS SHREDDED. FROM SCREAMING FOR YOU. GIVE ME A WEEK. The words were a mess, a chaotic scrawl of rage and desperation. She ripped the page from the notebook, marched back to Jez, and shoved it into his chest. He stumbled back a step, startled by her aggression, and looked down at the paper in her hand. His eyes scanned the words, his expression hardening.

“A week?” He let out a short, incredulous laugh, full of contempt. “I’m not running a rehab clinic. I need a singer, not a patient. You had one job, comedian. One. And you couldn’t even do that. You think this is a game? You think we just stop everything because you went too hard on your first day? That’s not how it works.” He crumpled the paper into a ball and threw it onto the floor. “I don’t care why you can’t do it. I only care that you can’t. We’re done here.”

He turned to the others, a clear dismissal of her presence. “Let’s just run the instrumentals. Waste of a night.” But as he turned, Lena spoke for the first time. Her voice was low and even, but it cut through Jez’s anger like a blade. “No.” All three of them looked at her. Lena was unstrapping her bass, her movements calm and deliberate. “She’s right,” she said, her gaze on Cassie. “She did that for us. For the audition. She tore her voice to pieces to show you she was serious.” She looked at Jez. “You asked her to scream. She screamed. This is the price. You don't get to punish her for paying it.”

Jez stared at Lena, a silent battle of wills passing between them. He had the fire, but Lena had the weight. She was the anchor of the band, in sound and in spirit, and her quiet dissent was more powerful than any shouted argument. He looked from Lena’s implacable face back to Cassie, who stood her ground, trembling slightly but meeting his glare with a fire of her own. He saw the defiance in her eyes, the refusal to be broken, and for a second, a flicker of something other than anger crossed his face. It might have been respect.

“Fine,” he snapped, the word cracking like a whip. “One week. You get one week.” He pointed a finger at her, the intensity of his stare pinning her to the wall. “But you don’t just rest. You work. Your hands work. Your brain works. The only thing that gets a rest is your mouth.” He kicked at her fallen bag. “I want that notebook full. Full. Not just a few good lines. I want pages of filth and fury and ugliness. I want the things you’re too scared to put in your jokes. I want the stuff you think at three in the morning when the world is quiet and you’re wondering what the fuck you’re doing with your life. You come back here next Tuesday, and you either have a voice and a book full of ammunition, or you are a ghost to us. We’ll never see you again. Got it?”

Unable to speak, Cassie gave a single, sharp nod. The ultimatum was brutal, but it was also a lifeline. It was a second chance, conditional and cruel, but it was a chance. She knelt, picked up the crumpled ball of paper from the floor, and stuffed it in her pocket. She gathered her bag and her notebook, the blank pages suddenly feeling impossibly heavy, a monument to the work she had to do. Without another word, she ducked under the door and stepped back out into the encroaching night. The band didn't start playing again. This time, the silence from Unit 12 felt like a dare.The week that followed was a lesson in the architecture of silence. Cassie’s apartment, once a backdrop for her restless pacing, became a sealed chamber. The familiar city sounds—the distant groan of a coal train, the cry of gulls, the rumble of traffic on the main road—were a muffled soundtrack to a film she was no longer in. Her world had shrunk to the four walls of her small living room and the vast, terrifying expanse of the blank pages in her new notebook. The silence was not peaceful; it was an active, hungry thing, a void that demanded to be filled. Her own body was a landscape of this new quiet. Every swallow was a conscious, painful act, a reminder of the price of her single scream. She would stand in front of the mirror and open her mouth, willing a sound to emerge, but all that came was a faint, useless hiss of air. The comedian who lived by her voice had been rendered mute, and in the profound quiet, she was forced to listen to the one voice she had spent her entire career trying to out-talk: her own.

Her old life did not let go easily. It scrabbled at the door of her new solitude, mostly in the form of her brother. The phone would buzz with his name, the cheerful photo of him on the screen a relic from a simpler time. She ignored the calls, letting them vibrate against the tabletop until they gave up, leaving behind a trail of guilty, blinking notifications. She knew his concern was love. She knew her mother’s frantic texts were love. But it was a love that felt like an attempt to pull her back to a shore she had already abandoned. It was the love of the wall, the comforting, enclosing embrace of the escarpment that said, *Don’t go anywhere, it’s safer here*. To them, her silence was an illness, a problem to be solved. They didn’t understand that it was the first, agonizing stage of a cure. The chasm between her world and theirs had become too wide to shout across, even if she’d had the voice to do so.

Jez’s ultimatum became her gospel. *I want the stuff you think at three in the morning.* It was a brutal but perfect creative brief. She sat at her small kitchen table, the notebook open, pen in hand, and tried to summon those thoughts. At first, her brain, so well-trained in the craft of comedy, rebelled. It kept trying to find the angle, the punchline. It offered up clever observations about her voicelessness, polished little bits about the irony of a comedian on vocal rest. It was the safe, familiar muscle, and it was completely useless. Every sentence she wrote felt slick and false, a betrayal of the raw noise she had made in the shed. She filled pages with these dead-end thoughts, her frustration mounting with every crossed-out line, every aborted attempt at being clever. The notebook, meant to be her weapon, felt like a testament to her fraudulence. She was a translator, not a writer, and she had forgotten the original language.

The turning point came on the third day, a day of grey, relentless rain that matched her mood. Rooting through the pockets of her jeans for a receipt, her fingers closed around a crumpled ball of paper. She pulled it out and smoothed it on the table. It was the page from the rehearsal, her defiant scrawl—*MY THROAT IS SHREDDED. FROM SCREAMING FOR YOU*. Below it, she saw the ghost of the words Jez had thrown back at her. The paper was a physical artefact of her humiliation and her defiance. Staring at it, she wasn't trying to write about some grand concept of being trapped; she was back in that moment, the smell of the room in her nostrils, the contempt in Jez’s eyes a hot brand on her skin. She remembered the coiled shame in her gut and the subsequent, liberating flash of pure rage. She picked up her pen, and this time, she didn't write about the feeling. She wrote from inside it.

The words started to come, ugly and sharp. She wrote about Jez’s face, not as a character, but as a map of cynical disappointment. She wrote about Lena’s quiet nod, an act of grace in a hostile room. She wrote about Mac’s wide, startled eyes. She wrote, in vicious, painstaking detail, about the feeling of being dismissed, of being worthless, and the surprising, feral strength she had found in that moment of utter failure. The pen was no longer a tool for crafting jokes but an instrument for lancing a wound. She filled page after page, not with poetry, but with evidence. She dissected her conversation with Dave, pulling apart his loving concern until she found the condescension underneath. She wrote about the faces in the crowd at The Anvil, their polite laughter feeling, in retrospect, like a form of tranquiliser. She was not crafting; she was excavating. And the deeper she dug, the more fuel she found.

The apartment became a cocoon of her obsession. Time dissolved into a cycle of caffeine, ink, and the steady scratch of her pen. She ate when she remembered, standing in the kitchen and shovelling cold spaghetti bolognese—a new tub Dave had left at her door without knocking—into her mouth without tasting it. She slept in two-hour bursts on the sofa, waking with the ghost of a sentence on her lips and scrambling for the notebook. The pages filled with a scrawled, chaotic script, a frantic outpouring of every resentment, every secret fear, every bitter observation she had ever polished into a harmless joke. It was a catalogue of her own quiet desperation, a long, venomous love letter to the cage she had only just realised she was in. She was dismantling her life on paper, and in the wreckage, she was finding the building blocks for a new kind of voice.

On the morning of the seventh day, she woke up to a sunrise that was painting the sky in lurid shades of orange and pink. The Anvil would be getting its beer delivery. Her mother would be doing her crossword. Dave would be clocking on at the mill. The world was proceeding as normal, but she was irrevocably changed. Her apartment looked like it had been ransacked by a madwoman. And on the table, the notebook sat, thick and heavy, its pages warped from the sheer volume of ink and angry pressure. It was full. She picked it up, the weight of it a solid, comforting thing in her hands. Hesitantly, she cleared her throat. The pain was no longer sharp, but a dull, bass-note ache. She took a breath and, for the first time in a week, tried to speak. “Hello,” she said. The sound that came out was not her old voice. It was not the smooth, practiced drawl of Cassie Malone, comedian. It was a husky, gravel-road rasp, a sound with texture and damage and history. It was the voice of a stranger, and it was perfect.The drive to Port Kembla on Tuesday night was a different pilgrimage. The first time, she had been a petitioner, full of a desperate, unformed need. The second time, she was a defendant, facing judgment. This time, she was a soldier returning to the front lines, armed. The notebook sat heavy on the passenger seat, a dense brick of ink and fury that had its own gravitational pull. Her new voice was an untested piece of equipment, a jagged, unfamiliar tool she was only just learning how to hold. She drove with a cold, clear-headed focus that felt utterly alien. The fear was still there, a low hum beneath the surface, but it was no longer the dominant frequency. It had been superseded by a sense of grim, unyielding purpose. The smokestacks didn't look like middle fingers tonight; they looked like sentinels, silent witnesses to the city's hard, unglamorous work, a job she was finally beginning to understand.

When she arrived, the roll-a-door of Unit 12 was heaved up to head height, a dark, gaping mouth that was neither welcoming nor hostile, but simply open for business. The air that spilled out was already thick with the smell of hot amps and exertion. Inside, they were not playing. They were waiting. Mac was perched on his drum stool, nervously tapping his sticks against his knees. Lena stood with her bass strapped on, her posture as serene as ever, but her eyes were fixed on the entrance. Jez was tuning his guitar, his back to the door, the small, precise movements of his hands a study in contained tension. The room was a courtroom, and she had been summoned. She ducked under the door, the heavy notebook clutched in her hand, and stepped into the charged silence.

Jez finished torturing a tuning peg and slowly turned around. He looked her up and down, his eyes lingering for a moment on her face, searching for some sign of weakness or retreat. He gestured with his chin towards the centre of the room. “Well?” he asked, the single word an entire cross-examination. It was the moment of truth. She took a breath, feeling the rough texture in her throat, and answered. “I’m here.” The sound that emerged was a revelation. It was her voice, but it had been stripped for parts and reassembled with gravel and smoke. It was low, raspy, and carried an authority that her old, smooth voice had never possessed. Mac’s tapping stopped dead. Lena’s eyebrows lifted in a silent, appreciative arc. Jez’s expression didn’t change, but a flicker of something—surprise, interest—passed through his pale eyes. He had expected a whisper or an apology. He had not expected this.

Cassie walked forward and placed the notebook on top of the main amplifier, the same spot where her crumpled page had sat a week ago. The solid thud of the book landing seemed to echo in the quiet room. “It’s full,” she said, her new voice making the simple statement sound like a threat. Jez stepped forward and picked it up. He didn’t open it at first, just held it, testing its weight in his hand as if judging a prize melon. He flipped it open, the pages stiff and dense with her frantic script. He thumbed through them quickly, his eyes not reading the words but absorbing the sheer volume of them, the relentless, ink-black evidence of her week’s labour. He closed it and tossed it back onto the amp. It was impossible to know if he was impressed or contemptuous. “Anyone can fill a book with garbage,” he said, his own voice a low counterpoint to her rasp. “Makes you a diarist, not a lyricist. Let’s hear it.”

He reached out, grabbed the notebook, and flipped it open to a random page somewhere in the middle. He scanned it for a second, then shoved it into her hands, his finger jabbing at a block of text. “That. Let’s hear that.” Cassie looked down. The page was a mess of crossed-out lines and angry revisions, but the section he’d chosen was brutally clear. It was about Dave’s visit, about the loving, patronising disappointment in his eyes. It was about the Tupperware container of spaghetti bolognese, a symbol of a life she was rejecting. Her heart hammered. This was too personal, too raw to be read aloud. But Jez’s stare was a physical force, leaving her no room to retreat. She looked from the page to his unyielding face, and took another breath.

She didn’t shout this time. She didn’t have to. The words, delivered in her new, scarred voice, had a power all their own. “He brought me peace in a plastic box. Mum’s spag bol. A taste of the good life. The safe life.” Lena began to play, a slow, clean bass line, just two notes repeating, a sound like a distant, ominous bell tolling. Cassie found the rhythm, her voice falling into the space between the notes. “And he looked at me with loving eyes. The kind of love that builds a fence. The kind of pity that feels like a padlock. ‘Don’t chuck a good thing,’ he said. A good thing. This slow, comfortable death.” Jez’s guitar entered, not with a roar, but with a sharp, clean, descending riff, each note a drop of cold water on her skin. Mac joined with a quiet, insistent clicking on the rim of his snare. The song was a skeleton, but it was alive. “I threw it in the bin,” she spoke, her voice dropping to a near-whisper, a conspiratorial growl full of malice and liberation. “I put his love in the garbage with the coffee grounds and the junk mail. And the plastic box made a sound. A hollow sound. The sound of something empty.”

On the final word, Jez stomped on a pedal and the clean riff exploded into a wall of furious, distorted sound. Mac crashed down on his cymbals, and the room was filled with a glorious, cathartic tidal wave of noise. Cassie was thrown back by the force of it, but she held her ground, her fingers clenched around the notebook. The music raged for a few bars and then cut off as sharply as it had begun, leaving a ringing silence in its wake. No one spoke. Jez was breathing heavily, his eyes closed for a second, as if listening to the echo of the noise in his own head. He opened them and looked straight at her. A slow, thin, predatory smile spread across his face. It was the most terrifying and beautiful thing she had ever seen. “Okay,” he said, the word hanging in the air, charged with a thousand volts. “Now we work.”The work began not with a bang, but with a slow, grinding dissection. Jez’s predatory smile vanished, replaced by the grim, focused expression of a bomb disposal expert leaning over a live device. He stabbed a finger at the first line of Cassie’s spag bol manifesto. “Right. ‘Peace in a plastic box.’ It’s a good line. It’s a picture. But it’s a headline. We need the article.” He looked at Lena, whose fingers were already finding the slow, two-note pulse on her bass. “The feeling,” Jez said, turning back to Cassie, his voice stripped of all emotion except a cold, surgical intensity. “What’s the feeling of that line? Don’t tell me, show me. Find it in your throat.” It was the beginning of a new kind of torture, more intimate and exacting than any heckler’s insult.

Their weeks fell into a punishing rhythm, dictated by the schedule Jez had laid out. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Seven o’clock until exhaustion or frustration claimed victory. The storage unit, once a hostile territory, became her second home, a foul-smelling, sweat-soaked crucible where she was systematically broken down and rebuilt. Jez was a merciless foreman. He would force her to read a page from her notebook, then make her read it again, and again, his ear cocked for a single word that rang false, a single emotion that felt performed rather than inhabited. He’d stop the band mid-crescendo, the sudden silence a physical shock, and point at her. “No. That’s self-pity. I don’t want your self-pity, I want your rage. They’re cousins, but they’re not twins. Find the anger in the sadness. Dig it out.”

It was a brutal education. Cassie learned that her cleverness, the very skill that had defined her, was a liability. It made her want to wrap a difficult feeling in a neat turn of phrase, to observe it from a safe distance. Jez would have none of it. He forced her to live inside the ugliest moments, to find the sound of her brother’s well-meaning condescension, the texture of a room’s polite indifference. There were nights she left the unit trembling with a fury so profound it left her dizzy, driving home with Jez’s dismissive critiques echoing in her head. “It’s a list of complaints. It’s not a song. A song moves. Where’s the movement?” But amidst the relentless criticism, there were flickers of something else. Lena would catch her eye after she’d finally nailed a difficult passage and give a slow, almost imperceptible nod of solidarity. Mac, after a particularly vicious takedown from Jez, would offer her a warm beer with a quiet, “That was sounding sick, though.” They were small gestures of grace in the relentless boot camp of Jez’s design.

Her voice, her new, damaged instrument, was a wild thing she had to learn to tame. She discovered it had different textures. There was the low, serrated growl she used for the spag bol song, which they’d started calling ‘Hollow’. There was the raw, open-throated scream she found when they worked on a piece about the soul-crushing boredom of a Sunday afternoon in the suburbs. And there was a third voice she hadn't yet mastered, a voice for the words she’d written about the laughter, the sound that had once been her bread and butter. The page was titled ‘The Good Stuff’, a bitter, sarcastic appropriation of her own thoughts from that night at The Anvil. The lyrics were venomous, describing the laughter of the Sydney crowds as the sound of people admiring a caged animal. But every time she tried to sing it, it came out as pure anger, a one-dimensional rage that Jez immediately rejected.

“It’s boring,” he snapped one Thursday night, after her third failed attempt. The band had built a frantic, almost joyous, high-speed punk track around the words, a musical contrast that made the lyrics feel even more vicious. But Cassie’s delivery was flattening it. “You’re just yelling. There’s no sarcasm. There’s no poison. You’re telling me they’re condescending; you’re not making me feel it. I want to be in the room with them. I want to feel them patting you on the head.” He glared at her, his patience worn to a microscopic thread. “You spent your whole life in that room. Fucking use it. Show me the smile you gave them when you wanted to spit in their faces.”

His words struck a nerve, a deep, shameful one. The smile. The wry, plastered-on smile that said *I’m in on the joke, even if the joke is me*. She closed her eyes, shutting out the cramped, sweaty shed. She wasn’t in Port Kembla anymore. She was back on a tiny, sticky stage in a Surry Hills bar, the air thick with the smell of craft beer and expensive perfume. She could see a man in the front row, bearded and bespectacled, his head nodding in appreciative amusement as she told a joke about her dad losing his finger at the steelworks. He wasn't laughing with her; he was appreciating a piece of authentic, working-class trauma. He was tasting it, like a new varietal of wine. She remembered the smile she had given him, a wide, bright, accommodating smile that was the most violent act of self-betrayal she had ever committed. She opened her eyes, looked straight at Jez, and let that smile spread across her face. Then, she leaned into the microphone. Her voice, when it came out, was not a growl. It was a high, sweet, almost girlish croon, dripping with a saccharine poison that was more chilling than any scream. “And they give you the good stuff,” she sang, her voice a parody of a 1950s pop singer. “The laughter of recognition… They love the way you bleed. It’s so… rustic.”

The band froze. Mac’s sticks hovered over his cymbals. Lena’s fingers stilled on the neck of her bass. Jez just stared, his mouth slightly open. The hideous, saccharine sweetness of her delivery against the furious backdrop of the music was a masterstroke of dissonance. It was funny and it was terrifying. It was the sound of a hostage smiling for the camera with a gun to her back. Mac let out a low whistle. “Jesus, Cass.” Lena’s rare, genuine smile broke through her serene mask. Jez shook his head slowly, a look of grudging, profound respect in his eyes. He had pushed her to the edge, and she had come back with a weapon he hadn’t even known she possessed. He nodded once, a sharp, decisive gesture. “That’s it,” he said. “That’s the one.” It was the closest he had ever come to a compliment, and it felt like winning a war.The breakthrough with ‘The Good Stuff’ did not bring peace. It shattered the old dynamic and from the shards, a new, more volatile one was forged. The work in the shed became less like a demolition and more like an frantic, high-stakes assembly line. The hostility Jez had directed solely at Cassie was now democratised, a free-floating, corrosive element that he applied to everyone, himself included, in the relentless pursuit of a better sound. They were no longer just practicing; they were building an arsenal. A line from Cassie’s notebook would be chosen, a raw nerve of a phrase like *“The silence in this town is a loaded gun,”* and they would attack it from all sides. Jez would wrench a jagged, off-kilter riff from his guitar, Mac would hammer out a beat that felt like a frantic heartbeat, and Lena would anchor it all with a bassline so heavy it felt like a physical weight in the room. Then all eyes would turn to Cassie.

Her relationship with Jez evolved into a form of trench warfare. They were fighting on the same side, but their foxholes were different. The space between them crackled with a creative and intellectual friction that was constantly threatening to ignite. He would listen to her deliver a line, his head cocked, and snarl, “That’s lazy. It’s just a statement.” She’d glare back, her new voice a weapon she was learning to aim, “It’s called starkness, you abrasive prick. It’s supposed to be ugly.” They would argue ferociously over a single word, a chord change, the placement of a pause. He pushed for brutal simplicity; she fought for the nuances of her own experience. But the arguments were productive. Each fight chiselled their raw material into something sharper, something more dangerous. They were forging a language together, a dialect of noise and fury, and in the heat of it, she found a respect for him that had nothing to do with liking him. He wasn't just angry; he was disciplined, his vision for the band’s sound as precise and unforgiving as a surgeon’s scalpel.

They had been working on ‘Hollow’ for two weeks, grinding it down and rebuilding it until it was a tight, menacing, three-minute encapsulation of suburban dread. They finished a run-through, the final chord crashing down and leaving a ringing, triumphant silence in its wake. They were all breathing heavily, drenched in sweat, wired on the energy they had just unleashed. Jez stood motionless for a long moment, then slowly placed his guitar in its stand. “It’s time,” he said, his voice flat, cutting through the adrenaline haze. Mac looked up from his kit, his face alight with a puppyish excitement. “Time for what? A beer?” Jez shook his head, his gaze sweeping over each of them before landing, with pointed intensity, on Cassie. “We’re ready. I booked us a gig.” He paused, letting the weight of the statement settle. “Next Tuesday. Opening slot. The Anvil.”

The Anvil. The name hit Cassie like a phantom limb ache. It was the epicentre of the earthquake that had shattered her old life. The name conjured a sensory ghost: the taste of flat beer, the sticky floor, the smell of disappointment and disinfectant. Returning to that stage, to that single spotlight, felt like a parolee being forced to revisit the scene of their crime. A wave of ice-cold nausea washed over her. She could picture the faces in the Tuesday night crowd, the tired steelworkers and local tradies who had been her bread and butter. They wouldn’t be coming to see a punk band; they’d be coming to see ‘Malone’s Mirth’. They would expect jokes about seagulls and the escarpment. The thought of their bewildered, pitying faces as she opened her mouth and screamed at them was a specific kind of horror. She would be a spectacle, a tragic cliché: the local comedian having a very public, very loud mid-life crisis. The fear was so potent it almost buckled her knees.

The week before the gig was a blur of controlled panic. The rehearsals intensified, transforming from creative workshops into gruelling, repetitive drills. There was no more experimentation. The setlist was written in thick black marker on a piece of cardboard taped to the wall, a five-song declaration of war against her former self. 1. *Static*. 2. *The Good Stuff*. 3. *Scrapbook*. 4. *Hollow*. 5. *Key*. They were twenty minutes of pure, concentrated velocity, a sonic testament to her rage and rebirth. They played the set over and over, Jez driving them relentlessly, until the transitions were seamless, until the rhythm was locked into their collective muscle memory, until Cassie could deliver her venomous lyrics on pure, ragged instinct. The songs were no longer just words from her notebook; they were living things, creatures with teeth and claws that she had helped create, and her job was to unleash them.

She was leaving the shed late on the Thursday night before the show, her body a single, comprehensive ache, her ears ringing, her throat raw. She ducked under the door into the cool night air and stopped dead. Parked beside her small car, looking as out of place as a church pew in a mosh pit, was Dave’s ute. He was leaning against the driver’s side door, his arms crossed, his solid frame silhouetted by a single, flickering fluorescent light at the end of the access road. He had been waiting for her. As she approached, he straightened up, and she saw the deep, worried lines etched around his eyes. He took in her appearance—the sweat-dampened hair, the dark circles of exhaustion, the faded black t-shirt that had become her uniform—and his expression softened into a familiar, heart-breaking look of pity. “Cass,” he said, his voice quiet. He held up a glossy brochure. “The Sydney Comedy Festival. I got us tickets. Front row for the big gala. I thought… I thought it might remind you.”

It was an olive branch. It was a lifeline back to the world she had known, a world of green rooms and punchlines and predictable applause. A world where she was known, and safe. She looked at the brochure in his hand, at the smiling faces of comedians she knew, people she had shared bills and beers with, and she felt a pang of something cold and distant, like looking at a photograph of a stranger’s holiday. “That’s not my life anymore, Dave,” she said, her raspy voice sounding gentle but firm in the quiet night. He shook his head, a gesture of profound, frustrated confusion. “Then what is this?” he asked, his voice rising. “This… noise? This anger? Is this your life now, Cass? Being miserable and screaming your lungs out in a tin shed with these… people?” He gestured with contempt at the closed roll-a-door, from which a low hum of amplifier feedback still emanated. Cassie looked at the ugly, dented door, the source of her pain and her exhaustion and her liberation. She turned back to her brother, to his kind, worried face, the face of the wall that had always kept her safe. “Dave,” she said, and the truth of the words surprised her as much as they would him. “I have never been less miserable in my life.” He stared at her, the words a barrier between them he could not cross. He finally dropped his head, defeated. The loving concern was gone, replaced by a deep, quiet grief. “I don’t even know who you are anymore,” he whispered.

The night of the gig arrived, thick with a sense of dreadful, exhilarating inevitability. Walking into The Anvil was like stepping into her own wake. The smell of stale beer and fried food was the same. The peeling paint on the wall behind the stage was the same. Barry, the owner, stood behind the bar, wiping a glass, and gave her a look that was a potent cocktail of skepticism and morbid curiosity. “You sure about this, Cass?” he grunted, his gut preceding his words. “It’s a bit different from your usual stuff, innit?” She saw some of the regulars at their usual tables, the blokes in their high-vis work shirts, nursing their schooners. One of them caught her eye and gave her a cheerful wave, mouthing, “Got any new ones for us?” She felt a cold knot form in her stomach. She just gave a tight, noncommittal nod, her face a blank mask she hoped concealed the frantic terror underneath. She was an alien in her own hometown, a ghost haunting the scene of her own life.

The darkness at the side of the stage was a familiar refuge, but tonight it offered no comfort. It was a loading bay for an execution. The act before them was a young, earnest folk singer with an acoustic guitar and a songbook full of heartfelt ballads about lost love and rainy days. He finished his last song to a smattering of polite, gentle applause, the sound she had once coveted and now despised. As he walked off, he nodded at them. “Good luck,” he said, his eyes wide with a kind of innocent fear at the sight of Jez’s snarling expression and Lena’s shaved head. Then the stage was empty, waiting. Mac was practically vibrating, bouncing on the balls of his feet, his knuckles white around his sticks. Lena was an island of perfect stillness, her eyes closed, her breathing slow and even. Cassie’s own heart was a frantic, irregular drum solo against her ribs. Jez leaned in close, his mouth next to her ear, his voice a low, conspiratorial growl that cut through her panic. “Don’t ask them to laugh. Don’t ask them for anything. You’re not here for them. You’re here for you.” He put a hand on the small of her back. “Now go out there and set the whole fucking place on fire.” He gave her a firm shove forward, propelling her out of the darkness and into the single, blinding glare of the spotlight.The single spotlight felt hotter than she remembered, a physical weight pressing down on her. The silence in the room was a living entity, thick with the weight of a thousand Tuesday nights of expectation. It was not the eager hush that precedes a punchline, but a confused, inquisitive quiet. In the dim light beyond the stage, she could see the familiar faces, the geography of her old life. She saw the bloke in the fluro work shirt who had slapped the table in appreciation weeks ago; tonight, his brow was furrowed in a question mark. She saw a table of nurses from the local hospital, their wine glasses paused halfway to their lips. This wasn't an audience; it was a jury. Her hand closed around the microphone, the metal cold and unyielding. She didn't lean on the stand as she used to, a casual prop for a casual wit. She gripped it, her knuckles white, her stance rooted to the stage, ready for an impact.

From the back of the room, a voice, thick with beer and bonhomie, sliced through the quiet. “Oi, Malone! Give us the one about the seagull and the kebab!” A ripple of supportive laughter followed, thin but genuine. It was a lifeline thrown from her old world, an invitation to retreat, to put on the comfortable mask and deliver the goods. It was a plea for her to be the person they knew, the person they had paid to see. The temptation was a physical pull, a tide of habit dragging her back to the safety of the shore. Her eyes flicked to the side of the stage, where Jez stood half in shadow, his face impassive stone. He gave no signal, no encouragement. The choice was entirely hers. She looked back at the crowd, at their hopeful, expectant faces, and felt a sudden, clarifying surge of cold fury. They didn’t want her. They wanted a ghost.

She took a deep breath, filling her lungs with the stale, familiar air of the pub for the last time. She did not speak. She simply gave a short, sharp nod to Jez. The room was not ready. There was no way it could have been. The opening chord of ‘Static’ was not music; it was a sonic detonation. Jez’s guitar exploded through the room, a raw, distorted blast of sound so violent that glasses rattled on the tables and half the patrons physically jumped in their seats. Mac’s drums crashed in a split-second later, a barrage of pure, concussive force. The comfortable Tuesday night chatter was not interrupted; it was annihilated, vaporised in an instant. Barry, behind the bar, froze with a half-wiped glass in his hand, his mouth agape in slack-jawed disbelief. The comfortable atmosphere of The Anvil, cultivated over decades, was ripped to shreds in a single, brutal second.

Then, Cassie’s voice hit them. It was not her voice. It was a sound they had never heard, a low, gravel-road rasp that clawed its way out of the speakers, dripping with a venom they could not comprehend. “This town’s got a silence,” she snarled, her body coiled like a spring, her eyes sweeping across their shocked faces, “and the silence is a loaded gun.” The words were not a setup; they were an indictment. She was not a wry observer anymore; she was the lead prosecutor, and they were all on trial. The confusion on their faces began to curdle into something else. Disbelief. Offence. A woman in the front row, who Cassie vaguely recognised as one of her mum’s friends, shook her head slowly, a look of profound, pitying sadness on her face. The man in the fluro shirt was no longer confused; he looked personally insulted, as if she had just spat in his beer.

The song crashed to a halt, the abrupt silence almost as shocking as the noise had been. But before a single murmur could rise from the stunned crowd, Mac’s sticks clicked four times, a sound like a metronome counting down to an execution, and they launched into ‘The Good Stuff’. The tempo was frantic, a joyous, runaway train of a punk song that was utterly at odds with the poison in the lyrics. This was the moment of true betrayal. Cassie’s face contorted into the wide, bright, accommodating smile she had perfected over years of self-betrayal. She looked at the crowd, at their angry, bewildered faces, and she crooned into the microphone, her voice a high, saccharine parody of innocence. “And they give you the good stuff… the laughter of recognition…” Her delivery was sweet as cyanide, a grotesque pantomime of her old self. The irony was a blade she twisted, not for a laugh, but to draw blood. A man near the back stood up, scraping his chair loudly across the floor, threw a ten-dollar note on the table, and walked out, slamming the pub door behind him. The sound was a small victory.

They were a machine now, a single entity fuelled by the room’s gathering hostility. They tore through ‘Scrapbook’, a two-minute blast of fury about the prison of nostalgia, and plunged straight into ‘Hollow’, its slow, menacing pulse a welcome change of pace that only made the room feel more claustrophobic. Cassie was no longer seeing individual faces. The audience had become a single, disapproving organism, and she was feeding on its negative energy. She was not just singing songs; she was performing an exorcism on that very stage, casting out the ghost of the clever, funny woman who used to live there. Each word was a sharpened stone aimed at her own reflection in the bar fridge, the distorted, ghostly woman she was finally killing.

The set ended with ‘Key’, the last song in the notebook, her final statement. She poured everything she had left into it, her voice shredding, her body trembling with exhaustion and adrenaline. The song collapsed into a final, chaotic squall of feedback and noise, which Jez allowed to hang in the air for three long, agonising seconds before silencing it with the palm of his hand. And then… nothing. The silence that filled the room was absolute, a dead, arctic vacuum. There was no applause. There were no boos. There was only the low hum of the amplifiers and the collective, stunned stare of a hundred people who had just witnessed a public execution and weren't sure who had died. They looked at her not with anger anymore, but with a kind of blank, uncomprehending pity. They had come for a laugh, and had been shown a wound.

With a calmness that felt utterly alien, Cassie placed the microphone back into its stand, the click of metal on metal unnaturally loud in the dead air. She did not bow. She did not smile. She did not acknowledge them in any way. She simply turned her back on the spotlight, on the jury of her former fans, and walked into the cool, anonymous darkness at the side of the stage. The rest of the band followed, their faces grim and unreadable. As the darkness enveloped her, she leaned her forehead against the cool, peeling paint of the wall. Her body was a wreck, her throat was on fire, her ears were ringing with the ghost of the feedback. And in the silent, empty space where the applause was supposed to be, she felt a single, tearless sob of pure, unadulterated triumph rise in her chest. She hadn't won them over. She hadn't even survived. She had utterly, gloriously, and completely annihilated them. The fire was lit. The job was done.The darkness at the side of the stage was absolute, but the silence from the room beyond was louder. It was a dense, weighted silence, a physical presence that pressed in on them, thick with judgment and incomprehension. Mac was the first to break, his body slumping against a stack of amps as if the strings holding him up had been cut. He ran a shaking hand through his sweaty hair, his face a mask of bewildered deflation. The punk rock riots he’d read about involved flying bottles and a screaming mob, not this funereal, offended stillness. Lena, however, was a pillar of calm. She carefully placed her bass in its stand, and in the gloom, Cassie could see the faint, sharp curve of a smile on her lips. It was a smile of profound, quiet satisfaction, the look of a craftsman who has executed a difficult, dangerous task perfectly.

Jez was the last to step out of the light, his movements slow and deliberate. He unplugged his guitar, the soft electronic pop sounding like a gunshot in the charged atmosphere. He didn’t look at Mac or Lena. His pale eyes found Cassie’s in the dark. He held her gaze for a long, unblinking moment, and in their depths, she saw no disappointment, no anger, only the dying, incandescent glow of the fire they had just set. He gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. It was not a gesture of congratulation. It was an acknowledgement of a fact, a co-conspirator’s confirmation that the bomb had gone off exactly as planned. The silence from the crowd was not a failure; it was the result.

The walk from the stage to collect their gear was a walk through a graveyard of their own making. No one moved to leave. The audience remained frozen in their seats, their faces a gallery of bewilderment and distaste. They stared at the band not as performers, but as vandals who had just defaced a beloved public monument. Cassie felt their eyes on her, a hundred tiny pinpricks of rejection. They weren't seeing Gutter Glitter. They were seeing Cassie Malone, the funny girl from down the road, who had inexplicably, unforgivably, turned on them. She avoided their gazes, focusing on a sticky patch on the floor, her face a hard, blank mask. The shame she had expected to feel was absent, replaced by a cold, exhilarating sense of finality. She had burned the bridge, and now she was walking through the embers.

As they approached the bar, a large, solid obstacle moved to block their path. Barry’s face was a thundercloud, his complexion a mottled, unhealthy red. He held a wet rag in one hand, gripping it so tightly his knuckles were white. He didn’t shout. His voice, when it came, was a low, venomous growl, freighted with a sense of personal betrayal that was far worse than simple anger. He spoke only to Cassie, ignoring the others as if they were merely her hired thugs. “What the hell was that, Cass?” he hissed, his piggy eyes narrowed to slits. “I gave you a stage. This stage. People come here to have a good time, not to have… whatever the hell that was, screamed at them. You cleared half my Tuesday night trade in twenty minutes.”

Cassie opened her mouth to reply, her new voice ready with a retort, but Jez stepped in front of her, a shield of pure, coiled contempt. He was a good foot shorter than Barry and half his weight, but he radiated an energy so hostile that the big man took an involuntary step back. “We’re here for our gear,” Jez said, his voice dangerously soft. “Get out of the way.” Barry’s eyes flicked to Jez, then back to Cassie, the anger in them morphing into a kind of final, damning pity. “You’ve chucked it all, girl. For this.” He spat the word out like something rotten. He reached under the bar, but instead of the drink tickets, he slapped a fifty-dollar note onto the sticky wood. “Here. That’s for your gear. Now get it, and get out. And don’t ever come back. You’re done here. All of you.”

Jez looked at the fifty-dollar note with a slow, theatrical sneer. He let out a short, humourless laugh. “Keep your charity, old man,” he said, his voice dripping with disdain. “We didn’t come here to get paid.” He turned his back on Barry, a gesture of ultimate dismissal, and led them towards the back door that opened into the service alley. The fifty dollars lay on the bar, a final, pathetic attempt to translate their act of sonic violence back into the comfortable language of commerce, an offer they had already refused.

The alley behind The Anvil smelled of overflowing bins, grease, and the faint, clean scent of the approaching salt air from the harbour. The cool night was a shock after the suffocating atmosphere of the pub. Mac slumped against the brick wall, letting out a long, shaky breath. “Well,” he said to no one in particular, his voice a nervous squeak. “They fucking hated us.” Lena leaned against the wall beside him, pulling a dented silver flask from the inside pocket of her jacket. “No,” she said, her voice calm and precise as she unscrewed the cap. “They didn’t hate us. They didn’t understand us. It’s a much more powerful result.” She took a short pull from the flask and passed it to Cassie. The whiskey was cheap and harsh, and it burned a clean, welcome path down Cassie’s raw throat.

Jez stood apart from them, staring out into the darkness of the alley. “Applause is easy,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “Applause is a transaction. They give you money, you give them a feeling they already know how to have. It’s a closed loop. It’s comfortable. It’s death.” He turned to face them, his eyes burning with a fierce, intellectual intensity. “What you did in there,” he said, his gaze fixed on Cassie, “was break the loop. The silence wasn’t empty. It was full of what they couldn’t process. Full of their own discomfort. You gave them the wound, not the bandage. That’s real. That’s the only thing that’s fucking real.” He walked over and took the flask from Cassie, his fingers brushing hers. He took a long swallow, his throat working. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and handed the flask back to her. “Tonight wasn't a gig,” he said, a rare, thin smile gracing his lips. “It was a declaration.”

The walk home through the sleeping streets of Wollongong was a journey through a city that no longer felt entirely hers. The sodium lights cast long, lonely shadows. A group of teenagers loitering outside a closed kebab shop fell silent as she passed, their whispers following her down the block. The news was already travelling on the small-town telegraph. *Did you hear about Cassie Malone?* She felt like a ghost, visible but untouchable, a local legend of failure already taking shape. The weight of her brother’s disappointment, her mother’s inevitable worry, the collective head-shaking of an entire community—it was a heavy cloak, but a strangely liberating one. She had stepped outside the circle of their approval, and while the air was cold out here, it was also clean.

Back in her silent apartment, the adrenaline finally receded, leaving behind a profound, bone-deep exhaustion. The ripped poster in her bin, the full notebook on her table, the lingering ache in her throat—they were artefacts of a revolution. She wasn't that smiling woman anymore, and this wasn’t the quiet room where that woman despaired. The silence in her apartment no longer felt like a void. It was a space she had cleared, a foundation she had levelled with her own hands. She had annihilated her old audience, her old career, her old self. The triumph she felt was not the hot flush of victory, but the cold, sober certainty of having made the right, irrevocable choice. There were no more bridges left to burn. There was only the open, unknown, and terrifying road ahead.The morning after did not bring clarity, only the gritty residue of adrenaline and cheap whiskey. Cassie awoke to a silence in her apartment that was different from the pregnant quiet of the past week. That had been a silence of preparation, a holding of breath. This was a silence of consequence, the hollow, ringing aftermath of an explosion. The sun cut a sharp, unforgiving stripe across her dusty floorboards, illuminating a world that had not ended, but had simply rearranged itself around the crater she had created. Her body was a map of the previous night’s battle: her throat was a landscape of scorched earth, her muscles screamed with a dull, thrumming ache, and her ears were still tuned to a phantom frequency of feedback. She lay in bed for a long time, listening to the city wake up outside her window, the familiar sounds of garbage trucks and distant train horns now feeling like transmissions from a foreign country. The triumphant blaze she’d felt in the alley had cooled, leaving behind the cold, hard ash of reality. She had done it. She had burned it all down. Now she had to live in the ruins.

Venturing outside for milk felt like a foray into enemy territory. She pulled on a hoodie, pulling the hood up not against a chill but as a flimsy shield against the inevitable glances. Her old Wollongong, a place of easy smiles and casual nods, was gone. In its place was a city of averted eyes and sudden, hushed conversations that stopped the moment she came into view. At the corner store, Mrs. De Luca, a woman who had been cheerfully slipping her extra slices of ham for twenty years, suddenly found the countertop intensely interesting, her usual torrent of gossip drying up into a tight, pursed-lipped nod. Cassie paid for her milk and fled, the small silver bell on the door sounding like an alarm announcing her presence. Walking down the street, she saw a woman she knew from a yoga class she’d once tried. The woman’s eyes widened in recognition, then flickered away, her pace quickening as she crossed the street to avoid an interaction. Each averted gaze, each pointed silence, was a small, sharp confirmation. She was no longer Cassie Malone, the local girl who made good with a joke. She was a story. A cautionary tale. The comedian who went crazy on stage at The Anvil.

The inevitable confrontation came that afternoon, not with a bang, but with the quiet, funereal knock of her mother’s hand on her apartment door. When she opened it, they were standing there like a grim delegation: her mother, her face a mask of sleepless worry, clutching a Tupperware container of what looked like chicken soup as if it were a holy relic; and Dave, his arms crossed, his expression a hard, angry wall of disappointment. They stepped inside, and her small apartment instantly felt crowded and airless, shrinking under the sheer weight of their concern. Her mother’s eyes scanned the room, taking in the chaos—the scattered notebooks, the empty coffee mugs, the general air of manic neglect—and her face crumpled further.

“Oh, Cassie,” her mother began, her voice trembling. “What’s happening to you? Barry from the pub rang me this morning. He was so upset. He said you… you screamed at people. Is it those people you’re with? Are they giving you drugs?” The questions came out in a panicked rush, a mother’s frantic search for a simple, external cause for a problem she could not comprehend. The Tupperware was placed on the table, a desperate offering of love and normalcy. Dave didn’t speak, but his silence was more damning than any accusation. He looked around the room as if investigating a crime scene, his gaze lingering on a Gutter Glitter flyer Cassie had pinned to the wall, a crude, photocopied image of a snarling wolf.

“I’m not on drugs, Mum,” Cassie said, her raspy voice sounding calm, almost gentle. The lack of defensiveness seemed to confuse them more. “What you heard is true. I did scream. It’s what we do. It’s the music.”
“Music?” Dave finally spoke, the word exploding from him, thick with incredulous rage. “That wasn’t music, Cass. I’ve had people calling me all day. People I work with. They said you looked sick. They said you were scaring people. You humiliated yourself. You humiliated us. For what? To make some… noise?” He jabbed a finger towards the flyer. “With him? That little rat-faced punk who looks like he’d steal the fillings from your teeth? What has he done to you?” The protectiveness in his voice was so fierce, so primal, it was almost touching. He saw her as a victim, a lamb led astray, because the alternative—that she had chosen this, that she was the architect of her own social destruction—was unthinkable.

“Jez hasn’t done anything to me, Dave,” Cassie replied, her voice steady. She looked from her brother’s furious, hurt face to her mother’s tear-streaked one. The chasm between them was vast and dark, and she knew no words could bridge it. “This isn’t something that happened *to* me. This is something I’m doing. This is mine. I know you can’t understand it, and I know it hurts you. I’m sorry for that. But I’m not sorry for what I’m doing.” She was no longer pleading or justifying. She was stating a fact, a law of her new physics. Her mother began to cry softly, a sound of pure, helpless grief. Dave just shook his head, his anger collapsing into a profound, weary sadness. He looked at the stranger in front of him, this woman with a voice like a rusted hinge and a cold fire in her eyes, and he couldn't find his sister anywhere. “I can’t do this, Cass,” he said, his voice cracking. “I can’t watch this.” He put an arm around their mother, gently steering her towards the door, away from the wreckage. “We’ll… we’ll be here when you’re done with this,” he said, but it sounded like a farewell. The door closed behind them, leaving the container of soup on the table, a small, pale monument to a love that could no longer reach her.

The familiar, grimy sanctuary of Unit 12 was a welcome relief from the suffocating weight of family. When she arrived, Mac was anxiously pacing the small space, while Jez was methodically changing a guitar string, his movements precise and detached. The post-gig high had evaporated, replaced by the grim, practical question of ‘what next’. Mac stopped pacing as she entered. “So… my mum’s cousin’s friend was at the pub,” he said, his voice a nervous squeak. “She said we’re the talk of the town. Not in a good way. She said Barry’s telling everyone we’re maniacs and you’re having a breakdown. So… what do we do now? We’re banned from the only place that would have us.” His anxiety was palpable; for him, the band was a dream of punk rock glory, not a fast track to being unemployable and infamous in his hometown.

Jez didn’t look up from his guitar. “So we’re infamous,” he said, his tone bored and dismissive. “Good. That’s better than being unknown. It’s currency.”
“It’s not currency if no one will book us!” Mac retorted, his voice rising in frustration. “We can’t just play in this shed forever! We need to play shows!”
“Shows will come,” Jez said, finally looking up, his eyes cold. “We don’t chase them. We do the work. The work is the point. When we’re ready, we’ll play. On our terms.” His artistic purity was a fortress, impenetrable to practical concerns like rent or reputation. Before the argument could escalate, Lena, who had been silently unpacking her bass, spoke. “We need a recording,” she said, her calm, practical voice cutting through the tension. “A good one. Not some demo we make on a laptop. Something that sounds like us. Something we can send to people outside of this town. To zines, to radio shows in Sydney, to other bands.” She looked at each of them in turn, her logic undeniable. “The Anvil was a statement. Now we need a document.”

The idea was a life raft. It gave them a purpose beyond abstractly ‘doing the work’. It was a tangible goal, a way to forge a path out of the hole they had dug for themselves. But the reality was just as stark. Professional recording cost money. Money they did not have. The argument simply shifted from gigs to finances, a circular, dispiriting conversation that went nowhere. The energy from the gig, the sense of defiant unity, had already begun to fray, threatened by the mundane, inescapable pressures of the real world. Cassie sat on a milk crate, the familiar despair of a dead end creeping back in, a feeling she thought she had screamed out of her system. Her grand act of liberation had led her right back here, to a group of broke, argumentative musicians in a tin shed with no prospects and no plan.

That night, she sat in her silent, empty apartment, the uneaten soup a silent accusation on her table. The isolation felt more profound than ever. The city hated her, her family thought she was lost, and her band was an unstable mixture of ideology and anxiety. The triumph of the previous night felt like a delusion, a manic fantasy that had crashed against the hard shores of Wednesday morning. Was this it? Was this the glorious, messy new life she had chosen? A pariah in her hometown, fronting a band that might implode from its own lack of momentum before they ever played a second gig. The thought that had haunted her at The Anvil returned, but with a new, crueler twist: *Was that it? Was that your one and only shot?* A flicker of movement at her front door caught her eye. A piece of paper, folded messily, had been pushed under the door. Her heart gave a lurch of fear—a note from a neighbour, a complaint, a threat? She walked over slowly and picked it up. It was a single sheet of A4 paper, folded into a makeshift pamphlet. The front was a crude, high-contrast photocopy of a blurry photograph—a photo of them on stage at The Anvil, Cassie’s face a contorted mask, Jez a blur of motion beside her. The ink was smudged, the image barely decipherable, but it was unmistakably them. Below the image, scrawled in angry, thick black marker, were five words. “More noise. Less silence. Wollongong.” She unfolded it. Inside was a chaotic collage of cut-up text and images, a tirade against the city’s complacency, its boring pubs, its predictable bands. It was a homemade punk zine, raw and passionate and utterly authentic. And on the back, another message, this one handwritten, in a different, spikier script. It was a single sentence, an echo and a response to her own lyrics. *The silence isn’t a loaded gun. It’s just empty. Thanks for firing back.*Cassie stared at the crude pamphlet in her hands, her fingers tracing the jagged, cut-out letters. It felt impossibly light, yet it carried a weight that anchored her in the swirling chaos of the last twenty-four hours. She read the handwritten sentence on the back again, her lips forming the words in the silence of her room. *The silence isn’t a loaded gun. It’s just empty. Thanks for firing back.* This anonymous author hadn’t just heard their noise; they had understood the philosophy behind it. They had listened to her lyrics, her private declaration of war, and had written a reply. It was a single, flickering light in a vast, dark expanse of misunderstanding and rejection. It was proof that she was not screaming into a void, but into a silence where at least one other person was listening, waiting for a signal. She looked over at the kitchen table, where the container of her mother’s soup sat, its pale, placid surface a symbol of a love she could no longer digest. That was a love that wanted to soothe, to quiet, to return things to normal. This zine, this messy, toner-stained piece of paper, was a different kind of connection entirely. It didn’t want to fix her; it wanted to join her in the fire. With a sense of cold, final clarity, she picked up the untouched Tupperware, walked to the bin, and dropped it in. This time, there was no guilt, only the clean, sharp feeling of a choice being decisively made.

The next evening, the atmosphere in Unit 12 was thick with a grim, post-battle malaise. The triumphant energy of the gig had fully dissipated, leaving behind the stark, practical realities of their situation. Mac sat slumped on a spare tyre, idly spinning a drumstick, the picture of defeated anxiety. Jez was hunched over his amp, fiddling with a loose connection, his silence a hostile, brooding presence that soured the air. They were an army without a war to fight, marooned on their tiny island of noise with no map and no supplies. Cassie walked in, the zine held carefully in her hand, and the familiar, dead-end argument about their lack of prospects started up again almost immediately.

“It’s pointless,” Mac was saying, his voice a low, frustrated drone. “We can’t get a gig in this town again. We’re blacklisted. What’s the point of ‘doing the work’ if no one ever hears it?” Jez didn’t even turn around, his voice a low snarl directed at the guts of his amplifier. “The point is the work itself. If you need a fucking gold star from a pub owner to feel like a musician, you can piss off and join a covers band.” Cassie didn’t say a word. She walked to the centre of the room, to the large, battered speaker that served as their communal table, and slapped the zine down on its dusty surface. The sound was sharp and commanding, cutting through the argument. Both men fell silent and looked at the strange object. Mac’s brow furrowed in confusion, while Jez slowly straightened up, his eyes narrowing with a wary, animal curiosity.

“Someone pushed this under my door last night,” Cassie said, her voice a low, even rasp. Jez stepped forward and picked it up, handling it with a strange delicacy, as if it were a piece of unexploded ordnance. He took in the crude, angry cover, the blurry photo of them in their moment of violent creation, and his expression remained unreadable. He opened it, his eyes scanning the chaotic, cut-and-paste manifesto inside, a primal scream of suburban boredom and artistic frustration. He flipped it over and read the handwritten message on the back. His face, for the first time since Cassie had met him, registered a flicker of genuine, unadulterated surprise. He read the line again, then looked up at Cassie, a new light in his pale eyes. “See?” he said, his voice a low, intense whisper. “See? It wasn't empty. You fired the shot and someone fucking answered.” He handed the zine to Mac, who took it like a sacred text. As Mac’s eyes widened, a slow, dawning grin spreading across his face, Jez’s focus returned to Cassie, his usual abrasive energy replaced by a kind of fierce, intellectual excitement. “This is it. This is everything. This is worth a thousand cheering idiots at The Anvil. This is the real connection.”

The zine passed from hand to hand, a talisman that transformed the mood in the room. The cloud of despair lifted, replaced by a frantic, renewed sense of purpose. Lena’s argument from the day before was no longer a practical suggestion; it was an absolute necessity. The zine was a message in a bottle they had received; a professional recording would be their message back, launched into the wider world. The conversation was no longer about whether they should, but how. The problem of money, however, remained an impassable wall. Mac had nothing, Lena’s part-time job at the university library barely covered her rent, and Jez seemed to view the entire concept of currency as a personal insult. They were stuck, their renewed purpose crashing immediately against the same old rocks. They threw out desperate, hopeless ideas: a Kickstarter they had no way to promote, borrowing from family who had already disowned them, a half-joking suggestion from Mac about busking that earned him a death-glare from Jez.

Cassie sat on her milk crate, listening to the circular argument, the familiar feeling of a dead-end closing in. She had burned her old life, but she had brought nothing from it but the words in her notebook. Her career, her savings, her reputation—all gone. But as she thought about it, a memory surfaced. A piece of the past she hadn’t entirely incinerated. It was from a brief, optimistic period two years ago when she’d considered starting a comedy podcast. Spurred on by a manager who told her it was the best way to ‘build her brand’, she had cashed in a chunk of her savings and bought professional-grade recording equipment. A Neumann condenser microphone, pure and precise, designed to capture every nuance of the human voice. A top-of-the-line audio interface. Expensive headphones. It was all still in a box in her wardrobe, a monument to a future that never was, a relic from a life where ‘building her brand’ had seemed like a worthy goal. The microphone alone was worth more than a month’s rent. It was an anchor to her past, but it was also a key. She stood up, and the argument died as all three of them looked at her.

“I can get the money,” she said, the words clear and solid in the sudden quiet. Mac looked at her with disbelief. Lena’s head tilted in curiosity. Jez’s eyes narrowed, searching her face with a suspicious intensity. “How?” he demanded. “You’re not going back to telling jokes, are you?” The question was an accusation, a test of her loyalty. “No,” Cassie said, her gaze steady. “I’m selling the tools. From my old job.” She explained about the microphone, the interface, the pristine equipment designed for a world of clean audio and polished wit, all of it sitting unused in the dark. It was the last, most valuable piece of her former identity. Selling it wouldn’t just be a financial transaction; it would be a final, unequivocal act of divestment. It was taking the last escape route she had and melting it down for ammunition. As she finished speaking, a new kind of silence filled the room. Mac looked at her with a kind of dumbstruck awe. Lena’s face held a deep, quiet respect. Jez held her gaze for a long time, the suspicion in his eyes slowly dissolving, replaced by an understanding that went deeper than their arguments, deeper than their music. He had demanded she have something to say. He had demanded she bring the fuel. He had never imagined she would be willing to set her own house on fire to provide it.The trip to Sydney was a reverse pilgrimage, a journey not towards a shrine but away from a ghost. Cassie drove north, the escarpment shrinking in her rear-view mirror, no longer a wall but just another feature in a landscape she was leaving behind. On the passenger seat beside her sat a heavy cardboard box, sealed with packing tape. It was a coffin for her former self. Inside, nestled in foam, lay the pristine tools of a life she no longer wanted: the German-engineered microphone that promised broadcast-quality warmth, the sleek audio interface with its intimidating array of knobs and inputs, the professional-grade headphones designed to isolate sound, to create a perfect, clean, controllable world. As the industrial haze of Wollongong gave way to the sprawling, sun-bleached suburbs of Sydney, she felt a strange, cold calm settle over her. She was not escaping; she was conducting a burial at sea, and the ocean was a river of asphalt flowing into the heart of the city she had once yearned to conquer.

The audio equipment store was in a trendy, inner-city suburb, a brightly-lit, minimalist space that felt more like an art gallery than a shop. It smelled of new electronics and freshly brewed espresso from the café next door. It was the polar opposite of the sweat-and-rust funk of Unit 12. Men with carefully curated beards and expensive sneakers drifted through the aisles, discussing signal chains and phantom power in low, reverent tones. Cassie, in her faded black t-shirt and worn jeans, felt like a barbarian in a temple. The box in her arms felt heavy and crude. A young man with geometric glasses and an air of bored expertise glided out from behind the counter. He took the box from her and began unpacking the contents with an unnerving, almost surgical precision, his slender fingers handling the equipment as if it were ancient statuary.

“It’s all in good condition,” the tech said, his voice flat and clinical as he plugged the microphone into a test board. “Barely used.” He motioned for Cassie to put on a pair of test headphones. “Just say a few words for me. Testing, one, two.” Cassie put the headphones on, the padded cups instantly sealing her off from the world, plunging her into an unnerving, artificial silence. She leaned into the Neumann mic, the familiar proximity to its delicate mesh grille a jolt of muscle memory. “Hello,” she said, and the sound that bloomed in her ears was a ghost. It was her old voice, the one she had lost. It was clear, smooth, and resonant, stripped of all its new-found gravel and grit, digitally polished into a perfect, soulless instrument. It was the voice of a stranger she had once been, and hearing it one last time felt like viewing her own body on an autopsy table. She pulled the headphones off abruptly, the noise of the store rushing back in, a welcome, messy chaos. “It works,” she said, her own raspy voice a comforting return to reality. The tech nodded, already calculating figures on a tablet. He named a price. It was less than she had paid, but more than they needed. “I’ll take it,” she said, before she could change her mind.

The wad of cash was thick and illicit in her pocket, a dense, rectangular weight that felt both liberating and profane. The transaction was complete, the final tether to her old ambition severed. She didn’t drive straight back to Wollongong. Instead, drawn by a morbid curiosity, she walked. She wandered the streets of Surry Hills, a ghost in her own past. She walked past the small, fashionable bars where she had performed, their chalkboards now advertising artisanal gin and trivia nights. She stopped across the street from The Gilded Cage, the club that had given her her first headline spot in Sydney. The poster in the window was for a comedian she knew, a clever, sharp-witted man whose career was on a steep, upward trajectory. Laughter spilled out onto the street as the door opened and a couple stepped out, the sound bright, intellectual, and utterly controlled. It was the sound of an audience appreciating a well-made product.

She stood in the shadows, an invisible observer watching a scene from a life that was no longer hers. She felt no jealousy. She felt no regret. The feeling that washed over her was a profound and shocking sense of pity. Pity for the comedian inside, working so hard for that precise, managed laugh. Pity for the audience, paying good money to be safely amused, to have their own comfortable worldviews reflected back at them with a clever, ironic twist. She remembered the feeling of being on that stage, the desperate, draining work of being charming and relatable, of sanding down her own rough edges to make herself palatable. Compared to the raw, visceral, confrontational noise they made in the shed, this felt like a puppet show. It was a simulation of life, not the messy, glorious, painful thing itself. The wad of cash in her pocket was not just money; it was her exit visa from this entire world. She had bought her freedom.

The drive back south was a descent from the sterile heights of the city back into the grimy, beating heart of her own territory. The escarpment rose to meet her, no longer a prison wall but a familiar, brooding landmark. It was dark when she pulled up to the industrial park. The frantic, stop-start sound of the band arguing was audible even from the car. She walked into the shed to find them locked in the same stale standoff, Mac radiating anxiety and Jez emanating a cold, stubborn fury. They were a car without gas, spinning their wheels in the dirt. No one noticed her at first. She walked to the center of the room, to the amp that served as their altar, and pulled the thick bundle of notes from her pocket. She didn’t say a word. She just dropped the money onto the dusty surface. It didn’t make a loud noise, just a soft, dense thud, but it silenced the room as effectively as a gunshot.

Mac’s jaw dropped, his eyes wide with a look of pure, unadulterated awe. He reached out a hand as if to touch it, but then pulled back, as if it might be a mirage. Lena looked from the cash to Cassie’s face, and her expression was one of deep, solemn respect. She understood the weight of the sacrifice; she saw the ghost that had been exorcised. Jez was the last to move. He stepped forward, picked up the wad of cash, and methodically counted it, his face a mask of cold, practical assessment. When he was done, he stacked the notes into a neat pile. He did not say thank you. He did not acknowledge the personal cost. He looked at Cassie, his eyes locking with hers, and his gaze held a new and different kind of intensity. He saw a soldier who had completed her mission. “Okay,” he said, his voice a low, focused hum, brimming with a sudden, violent sense of purpose. “Now we find a studio that isn’t afraid to bleed.”The money on the amplifier changed everything, and it changed nothing at all. It was a tangible object, a stack of worn-out plastic notes that represented a solution, but the real power in the room remained where it had always been: with Jez. The cash did not buy Cassie a seat at the head of the table; it simply filled the fuel tank of the war machine he was already driving. The morning after her trip to Sydney, he was a man possessed, a feral animal that had finally been let off its leash. He sat cross-legged on the dusty concrete floor of the shed, his phone pressed to his ear, his voice a low, insistent growl as he interrogated a series of studio managers in Sydney. He wasn’t asking for rates; he was conducting ideological purity tests. “What kind of drum sound do you get? No, I don’t want it to sound like a cannon. I want it to sound like a fucking hammer hitting a wall… What’s your policy on vocal bleed? Good. I want it to bleed all over everything.” Mac hovered nearby, vibrating with an anxious, child-like excitement, while Cassie sat on her usual milk crate, a silent observer. She had provided the means, but the vision was still fiercely, exclusively, Jez’s. She watched him, a general planning a campaign with her blood money, and felt a strange sense of detachment, the quiet, hollowed-out feeling of a resource that has been successfully tapped.

Their first foray into the world of professional recording was a disastrous trip north, a journey into the sterile heart of the beast they were trying to fight. The studio Jez had reluctantly agreed to visit was located in a sleek, glass-fronted building in an inner-city creative precinct, a place that smelled of expensive cleaning products and ambition. A painfully cool audio engineer named Julian, who wore a pristine white t-shirt and had a tattoo of a waveform on his forearm, showed them into a main recording room that was less a room and more a sound-proofed vacuum. It was a perfect, acoustically-treated, beige-coloured box, designed to capture pure, unadulterated sound, stripped of any character or grit. Julian spoke in hushed, reverent tones about their vintage compressors and the clarity of their analogue-to-digital converters. Jez walked around the room, running a hand over the sound-dampening foam panels, his face a mask of gathering contempt. “So, nothing gets out?” he asked, his voice unnaturally loud in the deadened space. Julian smiled, a patronising, clinical smile. “The isolation is total. It means we have complete control over every element in the mix.” Jez looked at Cassie, his eyes glinting with a cold, savage light. “It’s a fucking sensory deprivation tank,” he said, his voice dripping with scorn. “It’s a hospital for noise. We’re not here for treatment.” He turned and walked out without another word, leaving Julian staring after him, his perfect, minimalist world momentarily disrupted by a blast of pure, unadulterated punk rock ideology.

The drive back to Wollongong was a tense, silent affair until Mac finally cracked. “What was wrong with that place, man? It was perfect! It had all the gear! That’s what a real studio looks like!” Jez’s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. “It was a tomb, Mac. A place where they kill sound and then dissect the corpse. They don’t want to capture a performance; they want to capture a series of isolated events they can manipulate later. It’s fake. It’s the opposite of what we do.” The argument raged, Mac’s pragmatism crashing uselessly against the monolithic wall of Jez’s purism. They were at an impasse, their newfound momentum already grinding to a halt. It was Lena, as always, who provided the way forward. She had been staring out the window at the passing smokestacks of the southern suburbs, silent throughout the entire argument. “There’s a guy,” she said, her calm voice cutting cleanly through the noise. “Silas. Used to do sound at The Hoist back in the eighties, when it was still a punk dive. I heard he’s got a place. Somewhere in the back of Dapto. No one uses him anymore. They say he’s a bastard to work with. And that all his gear is half-broken.” Jez fell silent. He glanced at Lena in the rear-view mirror, a flicker of genuine interest on his face. “Silas,” he repeated, the name tasting like rust and possibility. “Where do we find him?”

Finding Silas’s studio was not a matter of following a map, but of chasing a rumour down a series of increasingly neglected roads. The address Lena had procured was not for a building, but for a turn-off, a dirt track that branched off a semi-rural road behind a vast, desolate industrial estate. The track was rutted and overgrown, their car groaning in protest as it scraped past grasping branches and skeletal, abandoned pieces of farm equipment. The place itself was a huge, dilapidated corrugated iron shearing shed, its red paint bleached to a pale, leprous pink by decades of sun and salt. There were no signs, no cars, just a profound and intimidating silence. A single, heavy, sliding door was open just a crack, a sliver of darkness in the vast, sun-blasted wall of metal. They approached it with a sense of trepidation, like a search party arriving at a crash site. As they got closer, they could hear a low, electrical hum emanating from within, the sound of ancient, power-hungry machines lying in wait.

They slid the heavy door open, the grating screech of the metal runner echoing in the cathedral-like space. The inside of the shed was a cavernous, dusty twilight zone, vast and cluttered. At the far end, a man was hunched over a sprawling, archaic-looking mixing desk that looked like the flight deck of a decommissioned Soviet spacecraft. He was older, maybe sixty, with a wiry frame, a long, grey ponytail, and a face that looked like it had been carved from driftwood. A pair of oversized headphones were clamped over his ears, and he didn't seem to have noticed their arrival. He was intensely focused on a single reel-to-reel tape machine, his fingers delicately adjusting a knob. Wires snaked across the floor in a chaotic, dangerous web, connecting ancient amplifiers and strange, homemade-looking speaker cabinets to the monstrous desk. It was a workshop, a laboratory, a madman’s kingdom of analogue decay. Jez cleared his throat, and the man, Silas, slowly, irritably, pulled the headphones down around his neck. He squinted at them, his eyes pale and red-rimmed, devoid of any welcome. “What?” he barked, his voice a gravelly rasp. Jez stepped forward. “We’re Gutter Glitter. Lena sent us. We want to make a record.” Silas gave a short, humourless snort of a laugh. He looked them over, his gaze lingering on Jez’s cheap guitar, Mac’s anxious face, and Cassie’s defiant stance. “Everyone wants to make a record,” he said, his tone dripping with a profound, bone-deep weariness. “Most of them should be making a sandwich instead. You got money?” Jez nodded towards Cassie. “She’s got money.” Silas’s eyes flicked to Cassie, then back to the thick wad of cash she held. He showed no interest. “I don’t give a shit about your money,” he said. “I give a shit about my tape. It’s expensive. And I’m not wasting it on another bunch of kids who think being loud is the same as being interesting.”

This was a different kind of gatekeeper. He wasn't a snob like Julian; he was a purist of a different, more terrifying order. He was the high priest of a dying religion, and he wasn’t about to let a group of heretics defile his temple. He waved a dismissive hand at the space behind him. “Set up over there. I’ll give you ten minutes to make a noise. If I like the noise, we can talk. If I don’t, you can fuck off back to whatever garage you crawled out of. And don’t touch that mic,” he jabbed a finger at a bizarre, torpedo-shaped microphone from the 1950s that was held together with electrical tape. “It’s older and more valuable than all of you put together.” The challenge was laid down. There was no negotiation, no discussion. It was a pure, pass/fail test of their very existence. They scrambled to set up their gear in the designated corner, their movements frantic and clumsy under Silas’s bored, judgmental gaze. The vastness of the shed was intimidating, threatening to swallow their sound whole. This was not their cramped, familiar shed. This was an arena.

Cassie’s heart was a frantic, trapped bird. This felt more real, more consequential, than the gig at The Anvil. That had been an act of destruction. This was a plea for creation. They had one song, one chance to prove they were worthy of Silas’s precious, magnetic tape. Jez looked at them, his face a mask of grim determination. “Hollow,” he mouthed, and Mac clicked his sticks together four times. The sound was small and sharp in the huge room. Lena’s two-note bass line began, but in this space, it didn’t feel menacing; it felt lost, a tiny pulse in a vast emptiness. Jez’s arpeggiated guitar line felt thin and reedy. Cassie stepped up to the microphone Silas had indicated, a standard, battered Shure SM58, and drew a breath. She looked out into the cavernous gloom of the shed, at the shadowy forms of old machinery and forgotten projects, at the single, hostile figure of Silas watching them from behind his console. She did not sing to him. She sang to the room. She sang to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light from a grimy window high above. Her voice came out, raw and scarred, and instead of being swallowed by the space, it seemed to hang in the air, a physical, textured thing. She found a pocket in the rhythm and settled in, delivering the lines with a cold, controlled venom that was more powerful than any scream.

As the song built, something shifted. The band, spurred on by the hostile acoustics, dug in deeper. Mac’s drumming became heavier, more deliberate. Jez’s guitar gained a new, desperate edge. They weren't just playing the song; they were fighting the room, forcing it to submit to their will. By the time they reached the final, explosive crescendo, they were no longer a small band in a big space. They were a storm, a unified force of noise and intent that filled every corner of the vast shed with their furious, disciplined sound. The final chord crashed down, echoing off the high iron roof for a long moment before decaying into a perfect, resonant silence. They stood, panting, drenched in sweat, their fate now in the hands of the old man behind the desk. Silas was silent for what felt like an eternity. He slowly leaned forward and pressed a button on the console. A speaker crackled to life, and a distorted, monophonic recording of their performance blasted back at them, captured on some cheap, preliminary microphone. It sounded awful, a chaotic mess of frequencies, but through the noise, the raw, undeniable energy of the performance was there. Silas listened to the entire playback, his face completely impassive. When it was over, he switched it off. “The drums are sloppy,” he grunted, not looking at them. “The guitar needs more low-mid bite. And you,” he finally looked at Cassie, his pale eyes boring into her, “you’re singing a little behind the beat. Which is either a mistake or it’s intentional. Which one is it?” Cassie’s mouth was dry. “Intentional,” she rasped. Silas stared at her for a second longer, then turned back to his desk. “Good,” he said. “Let’s get to work.”The phrase “Let’s get to work” was not a starting pistol; it was the cocking of a hammer. The days that followed blurred into a single, continuous stretch of dust, sweat, and the pervasive, intoxicating smell of hot vacuum tubes. Silas’s studio was not a place of creative joy; it was a factory floor, and they were the raw materials to be hammered into shape. He did not ask for their opinions. He did not collaborate. He dictated. The first two days were dedicated entirely to the drums, a brutal, soul-crushing exercise in percussive deconstruction that nearly broke Mac completely. Silas spent hours moving a single microphone a centimetre to the left, then a centimetre to the right, forcing Mac to play the same simple, four-beat rock pattern over and over again, his face a mask of intense, scholastic concentration as he listened to the result through his ancient headphones. “Again,” he would grunt into the talkback microphone, his voice a disembodied, god-like judgment. “Again. It’s limp. I want to hear the wood of the stick hitting the skin of the drum. I want to hear the fight. Again.”

Mac, who played with a punk rocker’s frantic, joyful energy, was being systematically dismantled. Silas forced him to strip away every flourish, every ghost note, every instinctive fill, until all that was left was the bare, brutal skeleton of the beat. By the end of the second day, Mac’s hands were raw, a small blister on his right index finger having broken and bled onto the pristine white wrap of his stick. He was pale with exhaustion, his usual puppyish enthusiasm replaced by a kind of numb, shell-shocked obedience. He was no longer a musician; he was a component, a human metronome, and his only job was to be perfect. Cassie watched from the sidelines, a sick feeling of dread growing in her stomach. This was a different kind of cruelty to Jez’s abrasive impatience. Jez’s anger was a hot, chaotic fire. Silas’s method was a cold, precise blade, methodically stripping them down to their most essential, functional parts.

On the third day, he finally allowed Lena to plug in. She stood beside Mac’s battered drum kit, her bass slung low, a pillar of calm in the tense, dusty air. Silas’s instructions to her were minimal. “He’s the train track,” he said, gesturing to the broken Mac. “You’re the fucking train. Don’t wobble. Don’t get creative. Just be heavy. Now, lock in.” They spent the next eight hours on a single song, ‘Static’, playing the same two-minute blast of noise again and again. Lena, a machine of perfect, stoic precision, never faltered. She and Mac became a single, monstrous rhythm engine, the foundation Silas had demanded. It was during this process that Cassie first understood Silas’s philosophy of “bleed.” There were no isolation booths, no headphones. They were all in the same vast, cavernous room. The thundering boom of the bass drum bled into the guitar amp’s microphone; the shimmering decay of a cymbal was a ghost in the vocal track. It was a mess. It was chaos. And it was exactly what he wanted. He was not trying to build a song from separate, perfect parts; he was trying to capture the sound of a single, volatile chemical reaction. He was recording the room, not just the band.

Jez’s trial was a battle of tone. He had his sound, a carefully crafted wall of distortion and feedback, but Silas dismissed it with a contemptuous wave of his hand. “That’s a sound from a box,” he sneered, pointing at Jez’s array of effects pedals. “It’s a costume. I want to hear the sound of an amplifier trying to kill itself.” He forced Jez to unplug his pedals and plug his guitar directly into a series of bizarre, ancient amplifiers that looked like they had been salvaged from a plane crash. One of them, a squat, tweed-covered box with frayed wiring, produced a sound that was thin and nasal. Another hummed with a terrifying, unpredictable electrical current. Finally, he settled on a towering, nameless amplifier head sitting on a speaker cabinet with a torn grille. It was temperamental and ugly, but when Jez hit a chord, the sound that erupted was glorious. It wasn't just distorted; it was rich with complex, ugly harmonics, a sound that felt like it was tearing itself apart at the molecular level. For the first time, Cassie saw a look of genuine, grudging respect on Jez’s face. He had met a purist more extreme than himself, a master of a darker, more volatile art, and instead of fighting him, Jez submitted. He became a student, silently absorbing Silas’s cryptic lessons, his arrogance replaced by a quiet, focused intensity.

Cassie’s turn came last. She had watched the others be broken down and rebuilt, her dread mounting with every passing hour. She had filled her notebook with new lines, with observations about the process, the dust, the sound of Silas’s weary, nicotine-stained voice. When he finally motioned her towards the microphone—not the battered SM58 this time, but the ancient, torpedo-shaped monstrosity he had warned them about—her mouth was dry. The mic was a relic, its chrome body pitted and scarred, the electrical tape holding its components together brittle with age. It looked less like a piece of recording equipment and more like a weapon from a forgotten war. Silas adjusted it himself, his movements delicate and reverent. “This is a Reslo ribbon mic,” he said, his voice softer than Cassie had ever heard it. “It was used to record BBC announcers during the Blitz. It’s heard more bad news than you could ever imagine. Don’t scream at it. It doesn’t like to be screamed at. It likes the truth. Just tell it the truth.”

He had chosen ‘The Good Stuff’, the song with the saccharine, poisonous vocal. He wanted to capture it first. She stood before the microphone, the rest of the band arrayed behind her, ready. The headphones were on, and the sound in her ears was raw, electric, and alive. It was the sound of the room, of four people breathing the same dusty air. The count-in came, and the frantic, joyous music exploded around her. She closed her eyes, summoning the image of the Sydney bar, the condescending faces, the feeling of her own smile hardening on her face. She leaned into the ancient microphone and let the sweet, girlish croon slide from her throat. “And they give you the good stuff…” She got through the first verse, the dissonance between her delivery and the band’s fury feeling more potent than ever. Then, Silas’s voice cut through the headphones, sharp and surgical. “Stop. It’s not right.” The band crashed to a halt. Cassie opened her eyes. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice tight. “It’s a performance,” Silas’s voice crackled in her ears. “It’s a good one. It’s clever. But it’s an impersonation of a feeling. I don’t want the impersonation. I want the real thing.”

“That *is* the real thing,” Cassie shot back, a flash of her old defiance returning. “That’s the voice I used. That’s the smile I wore.” Silas was silent for a long moment. “No,” his voice came back, softer, more dangerous. “That’s the mask you wore. I want to hear the sound of the face underneath. I want to hear the sound of you putting the mask on. I want to hear the moment you decide to lie.” This was a new level of psychological dissection. It was an impossible direction. She didn't know how to perform a decision. The band waited, the silence stretching. “I don’t know what you mean,” she finally whispered into the mic, her frustration bordering on despair. Silas let out a long, weary sigh, a sound like gravel being poured onto sand. “Kid, I was doing sound at gigs in this country when half the bands couldn’t even play their instruments. But they had something to say. They were angry about the world. You’re not angry about the world. You’re angry about your life. It’s smaller. It’s more personal. And it’s more pathetic.” The insult was so direct, so casually cruel, it took her breath away. “Don’t sing me a song about some asshole in a bar in Sydney,” he continued, his voice relentless. “Sing me a song about the girl who wanted so badly to be liked by that asshole that she was willing to sell him pieces of herself for a cheap laugh. Show me that pathetic, desperate girl. I want to hear her.”

The word ‘pathetic’ landed like a punch to the stomach. It was the deepest, most secret fear she had about her old life, the truth she had buried under layers of wit and cynicism. She had not just been a clever performer; she had been a supplicant, a jester begging for the king’s approval. And Silas, with a few, brutal words, had stripped her bare in front of everyone. Her eyes stung with hot, furious tears. She looked through the control room window at his shadowy, indifferent form. She hated him. She hated him with a purity that eclipsed any feeling she had ever had for Jez. And in that moment of pure, undiluted hatred, she understood. The girl he was talking about, the pathetic, desperate girl—she wasn’t in the past. She was right here, right now, about to sing for this bastard’s approval. The decision wasn't a memory; it was happening again. It was a loop. The irony was so profound, so hideously perfect, it was almost funny. A single, sharp, humourless laugh escaped her lips. Mac clicked his sticks. The music started again. And this time, when Cassie opened her mouth, the voice that came out was something entirely new. It was a sound caught somewhere between a sweet song and a bitter laugh, the sound of a heart breaking and a joke landing at the exact same moment. It was the sound of the truth. After the final chord died, the silence in the headphones was absolute. Then, Silas’s voice, a low, gravelly whisper, filled her ears. “Yeah,” he said. “That’ll do.”### 10.

The approval from Silas, the two clipped words that had landed in her headphones like a surgeon’s final stitch, did not open a floodgate of praise or camaraderie. Instead, it simply unlocked the next, more grueling phase of the work. The trial was over; the sentence had begun. The days in the shearing shed ceased to be a series of auditions and became a single, unbroken period of hard labour, a marathon run in a dust-choked twilight. Silas moved with a new, almost terrifying sense of urgency. The time for psychological deconstruction was over. Now, it was time to build, and he was the only architect, foreman, and demolitions expert on site. His methodology remained brutal, but its purpose shifted. He was no longer testing their resolve; he was mining it, extracting every last ounce of their collective energy and feeding it directly onto the spools of his precious magnetic tape.

The vast, cavernous shed became their entire world. They arrived in the late morning, the sun already high and hot on the corrugated iron, and worked until they were swaying with exhaustion in the deep, insect-thrumming dark of the rural night. The place had its own ecosystem of smells: the hot, metallic tang of ancient amplifiers, the dusty, sweet decay of old wood and insulation, the sharp, clean scent of the isopropyl alcohol Silas used to clean the tape heads, and, increasingly, the sour, human funk of their own unrelenting sweat. Time was measured not in hours, but in the slow, inexorable turning of the tape reels, a pair of hungry, spinning eyes that consumed their every mistake and triumph with equal, magnetic indifference. They lived on stale servo sandwiches and lukewarm water, their breaks consisting of ten-minute stretches of dazed silence, sitting on overturned buckets in the sliver of shade by the shed’s sliding door, too tired to even speak.

It was during the recording of ‘Hollow’ that Cassie truly began to understand Silas’s obsession with “bleed.” He arranged them in a tight, combative circle in the centre of the huge room, with no baffles, no separation, just a few strategically placed microphones that looked like strange, metallic sculptures. When they played, the sound was a glorious, uncontrollable mess. In her headphones, she could hear the rattle of Mac’s snare drum vibrating through the floor and up her microphone stand. She could hear the raw, unamplified sound of Jez’s pick scraping against his strings, a tiny, violent ghost haunting the edge of the mix. Her own voice, raw and aching, was not a clean signal on top of the music; it was an element swimming within it, splashing onto the drum overheads, seeping into the guitar amp’s mic. It was sonically indefensible. It was perfect. “That’s the glue,” Silas’s voice crackled in her ears during a playback, as he pointed to a faint, almost inaudible tremor in the track. “That’s the sound of the air in the room moving. That’s the sound of four people in a fucking panic. You can’t fake that. You can’t add it in later. It’s either there or it’s not.”

The relentless work forged a new kind of intimacy between them, a non-verbal understanding born of shared trauma and collective exhaustion. The arguments between Jez and Mac subsided, replaced by a kind of grim, soldierly solidarity. One night, long after midnight, they were trying to nail a particularly difficult transition in a new, frantic song they’d started calling ‘Shearing Shed’. Mac, punch-drunk with fatigue, kept missing his cue, his timing thrown off by a fraction of a second. Jez, instead of exploding in a volley of insults, simply stopped playing, walked over to the drum kit, and quietly, patiently, hummed the guitar part, tapping the rhythm on Mac’s shoulder until the drummer’s head started nodding in time. It was a small, quiet gesture of teaching, not rage, and it felt more significant than any of their breakthroughs.

Late one evening, after a particularly punishing twelve-hour session, Cassie found herself outside in the cool dark, leaning against the warm metal of the shed wall, a lit cigarette—a habit she’d picked up from Lena—dangling from her fingers. The sky was a vast, clear canopy of stars, a profound, silent contrast to the noise and fury inside. Jez emerged from the darkness and stood beside her, not speaking, just staring up at the same star-dusted sky. The air between them was comfortable, the usual crackle of creative friction replaced by a shared, weary peace. “You really did it,” he said, his voice low, not looking at her. “You sold the crown jewels to pay for all this.” It wasn't a question or a thank you, just a statement of fact, an acknowledgement of the weight of her sacrifice. Cassie took a long drag from the cigarette, the smoke a welcome burn in her tired lungs. “They weren’t the crown jewels,” she said, her voice a quiet rasp. “They were the bars of the cage. I just melted them down.” Jez was silent for a moment, then he let out a short, sharp huff of air that was almost a laugh. “Fuck, Malone,” he said, shaking his head. “You’re going to be a real problem.”

Silas remained a remote and unknowable god, a creature of the control room. But occasionally, in the deep hours of the night, while waiting for an amp to cool down or a tape to be rewound, he would offer up a cryptic fragment of his own history. One night, while meticulously cleaning the heads of the tape machine with a cotton bud, he told them about a band from Adelaide in the early eighties. “They were called The Glass Children,” he said, his eyes focused on his task. “Three chords and a death wish. Made one album. Right here, in this room. The singer, he was in love with the sound of breaking glass. He brought a crate of bottles with him. Smashed one for every take. Got it all over the tape. Ruined two of my best microphones.” He paused, a flicker of a smile playing on his lips. “It’s the best-sounding record I ever made. No one ever heard it. But it exists. It’s real. Sometimes, that’s all that matters.” In his stories, failure was not just an option; it was a noble, even necessary, outcome. The goal was not success. The goal was to create a perfect, honest artifact of a specific moment in time.

They saved the last song for the last day. It was the first track on the setlist, ‘Static’, a short, brutal, mission statement of a song built around the lyric they had pulled from Cassie’s notebook: *The silence in this town is a loaded gun*. They had played it dozens of times, but for the final take, Silas had a final, cruel instruction. “I want one take,” he announced over the talkback. “From the top. No mistakes. No stopping. Play it like it’s the last song you’ll ever play. Play it like the world is ending in two minutes and this is your final statement. Don’t perform it. Testify.” The pressure was immense. They took their positions, their bodies aching, their minds frayed. Cassie stood before the Blitz-era microphone, its scarred chrome face a silent confessor. She looked at the others: Mac, his face a mask of fierce concentration; Lena, a study in poised stillness; Jez, his eyes closed, his whole body coiled like a snake. This was it. The culmination of the fights, the exhaustion, the money, the hope. Mac’s sticks clicked, a sound like a key turning in a lock, and then the world exploded. They played with a kind of desperate, final energy, a glorious, synchronized violence. It was not the sound of a band in a studio; it was the sound of a building collapsing in perfect, furious time.

When the last howl of feedback from Jez’s guitar finally died away, a profound, ringing silence fell over the huge room. They stood, swaying, their chests heaving, their bodies spent. No one moved. After a long moment, Silas’s voice crackled in their headphones, flat and devoid of emotion. “Alright,” he said. “Pack up your shit. We’re done.” It was over. A few hours later, the five of them were gathered in the dusty gloom of the control room, clustered like moths around the warm, glowing console. Silas had spent the time splicing leader tape onto the reels, his movements economical and precise. He threaded the master tape, the culmination of their shared ordeal, onto the machine. “You wanted a document,” he said, not looking at them. “Here it is.” He pushed up the main fader.

The sound that erupted from the huge, coffin-sized monitor speakers was not a song. It was a physical force. It was the sound of the room, of the air, of the dust. It was the sound of Mac’s bleeding hands and Lena’s relentless pulse. It was the sound of Jez’s amplifier screaming for its life. And on top of it all, weaving through the chaos, was Cassie’s voice, a scarred, raw, and utterly undeniable presence. It was hideous. It was beautiful. It was the truest thing she had ever heard. They listened to the entire twenty minutes in absolute, reverent silence. Mac wept quietly, tears of pure, exhausted relief streaming down his face. Lena stood with her eyes closed, a slow, serene smile spreading across her lips. Jez just stared at the speakers, his face pale and awestruck, as if he was witnessing a miracle he had somehow, against all odds, managed to conjure. Cassie felt a profound sense of dislocation, a vertigo that made the room tilt. That noise, that glorious, terrifying, honest noise—it had come from them. It had come from her. The last note of the last song echoed into silence, and the tape spooled to its end, the soft, flapping sound of it a final, gentle punctuation mark. The work was finished. In the humming quiet of the control room, surrounded by the ghosts of old technology and forgotten bands, they stood before the massive, unspoken question that their creation had just posed to the world. They had their weapon. Now they had to figure out who to shoot.
