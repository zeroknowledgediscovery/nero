The fat spat, a volley of tiny, angry explosions against the stainless steel hood. Alfie danced with the pans, a well-practised shuffle on the grease-slicked tiles. A fillet of sea bass, skin crisping to a silver-gold mosaic, sizzled in one pan; in another, a creamy garlic sauce bubbled, a fragrant cloud rising to join the general fug of a busy Friday night. The Salty Gull was heaving, a cacophony of clattering cutlery and booming seaside laughter filtering through the service hatch. It was a rhythm Alfie knew in his bones, the frantic percussion of the dinner rush. Slide, sizzle, flip, plate. Send it. Another docket, another order, another dance.

He was a good chef. Not a great one, not yet. He knew that. His plates were honest, hearty. He respected the produce, the fresh-off-the-boat mackerel and cod that Henderson, his boss, haggled for on the docks at dawn. But his mind was often elsewhere. Even now, with six tables waiting on mains, a melody was unspooling in the back of his head. It was a low, persistent hum, a bass line that thrummed just beneath the surface of his concentration. He found himself tapping the handle of a pan against the range in time, a syncopated beat only he could hear. *One day, you'll know my name*. The line, a soaring hook from a song he'd been wrestling with for weeks, tried to break free. He swallowed it down with a swig of lukewarm water, the taste of chlorine and old pipes.

"Alfie! Table four are asking where their scallops have got to! Said they could have swum here from France by now," Brenda bellowed, her head, crowned with a precarious heap of blonde curls, popping through the hatch. Her face was flushed, a combination of exertion and cheap foundation.

"Tell 'em the little blighters are putting up a fight," Alfie called back, not missing a beat as he tossed a handful of samphire into the bass pan. "Won't be a minute."

He worked with a fluid economy of movement, his lanky frame hunched over the stove. The heat was a physical presence, wrapping around him, sticking his cheap poly-cotton uniform to his back. But in the fire and the noise, there was a strange kind of peace. It was a performance, in its own way. A different kind of stage. He finished the bass, arranging it on a bed of the emerald-green samphire, a final flourish of sauce. He slid the plate onto the pass. "Service!"

The rush continued for another hour, a relentless wave of orders, before it finally broke, receded, and left behind the quiet aftermath of debris and exhaustion. The last plates were cleared, the last satisfied groans of the well-fed faded into the night. Henderson, a man whose shape resembled a well-stuffed sausage casing, poked his head into the kitchen.

"Good service, Alfie. That bass was flying out tonight."

"They were good fillets, Mr. Henderson."

"Aye, well. Don't forget to clean the grease trap. And for God's sake, lock up properly this time. Don't want to find the back door swinging open again." He grunted, a sound of finality, and was gone, the jingle of his keys fading down the corridor.

Alfie was alone. The kitchen, his chaotic kingdom, was suddenly silent save for the hum of the big walk-in fridge and the drip, drip, drip of a leaky tap he’d been meaning to fix for a month. This was the part of the day he loved almost as much as the first sip of a cold pint after a long shift. The quiet. The potential. He began the slow, methodical process of cleaning down, scraping the grill, scrubbing the surfaces until they shone dully under the harsh fluorescent lights. The smells of cooked food were replaced by the sharp, clean scent of industrial-strength lemon cleaner.

Once the last surface was wiped, he dried his hands on his apron, a gesture that signalled the end of one performance and the beginning of another. He walked over to the dry-store cupboard, a cramped space that smelled of onions and old cardboard, and retrieved his phone and a small, battered Bluetooth speaker. He placed the speaker on a stainless-steel counter, the tinny electronic chime as it powered on seeming impossibly loud in the stillness.

He scrolled through his music, his thumb hovering over a track labelled 'Starlight_Backing'. He took a deep breath, the air still thick with the ghosts of garlic and fish, and pressed play. A simple, searching piano intro trickled from the small speaker. Alfie closed his eyes. The greasy kitchen floor became a stage. The extractor fan hood became a spotlight. The rows of hanging ladles and whisks became a rapt audience.

He leaned against the counter, one hand resting on the cool metal, the other holding an imaginary microphone. And he began to sing. His voice, when it came, was nothing like the hurried shouts he used during service. It was a thing of surprising grace and power, a clear, soaring tenor that seemed to fill every corner of the room, to push against the tiled walls and reverberate back at him. It was a voice full of longing, of a hope so fierce it was almost painful. It spoke of small-town frustrations and big-sky dreams, of watching the container ships on the horizon and wondering where they were going. It was a voice that belonged somewhere else, somewhere bigger than a seafood restaurant kitchen in Lowestoft.

He’d only sent the video in as a joke, really. A dare. Him and Gaz, a couple of pints deep down at The Anchor, watching 'Britain's Voice' on the pub television. "You're better than that one," Gaz had slurred, pointing a chip at a preening contestant on the screen. "You should go in for it." The idea, ridiculous at first, had taken root. The next afternoon, nursing a hangover, Alfie had gone down to the north beach, the wind whipping his hair across his face. He'd propped his phone up on the sea wall, the grey North Sea churning behind him, and he’d sung. He sang his song, 'Starlight', his voice fighting against the cries of the gulls and the relentless shush of the waves. He’d watched it back once, cringed at the way the wind made his eyes water, and sent it off into the digital ether, expecting nothing. That was three months ago. He’d almost forgotten about it.

The final crescendo of the song built, and Alfie poured every last ounce of breath, of hope, of frustration into it. "…*and I’ll catch a starlight in my hand*!" The last note hung in the air, vibrating, perfect, before fading into the hum of the fridge. He stood for a moment in the silence, his chest heaving, his eyes still closed. It was a good take. Maybe the best he’d ever sung it. A little thrill, sharp and sweet, went through him.

His phone buzzed on the countertop. A text from Gaz, probably, asking if he was coming for that pint. He sighed, the magic of the moment dissolving back into the mundane reality of a Friday night. He picked up the phone, his thumb swiping across the screen to unlock it. It wasn't a text. It was an email. He squinted at the screen, his eyes still adjusting after the dim light. The sender was 'production.team@britainsvoice.co.uk'.

His heart gave a sudden, painful lurch. It was probably a rejection. A polite, automated 'thank you for your submission, but…' He’d had a few of those from other, smaller competitions over the years. He braced himself. His finger hovered over the message. He almost deleted it, unopened. But he couldn't. He had to know. He tapped the screen. The email opened.

The subject line seemed to glow, to burn itself onto his retinas. **Britain's Voice - The Grand Final!**

Alfie’s breath hitched. He read the first line. *Dear Alfie Finch, On behalf of the entire team at Britain's Voice, we are absolutely delighted to inform you…* He didn't need to read any more. The words swam, blurring into a meaningless jumble of letters. Delighted. Inform you. He scrolled down, his hand shaking so much he could barely control it. There it was. *…your submission has been selected by our panel. We would like to invite you to perform live in The Grand Final in London.*

London. The Final. It wasn’t possible. It was a dream. It was a joke. Maybe Gaz had somehow hacked the show’s email system as an elaborate prank. But it looked real. The logo was there. The details were there. The date. Next Saturday. Just eight days away. The venue. The Palladium. The actual London Palladium. A wave of dizziness washed over him. He gripped the counter to steady himself. He read the email again. And a third time. And a fourth. The words remained the same.

A sound escaped his throat, a strangled gasp that was half-laugh, half-sob. He was in. He was actually, impossibly, in. He forgot about the leaky tap. He forgot about locking the back door. He grabbed his phone and ran, bursting out of the kitchen and into the narrow, cobbled alley behind the restaurant. The night air was cold and sharp with the smell of brine and diesel from the harbour. He didn't stop. He sprinted, his worn-out trainers slapping against the pavement, past the shuttered shops and darkened pubs of the town centre. He wasn't just running; he was flying. The familiar, drab streets of Lowestoft seemed transformed, lit from within by the incandescent joy that was exploding in his chest. The moon, a pale sliver hanging over the dark sea, seemed to be smiling just for him. He fumbled in his pocket for his keys, his hands still trembling, and let himself into the small, damp flat above a bookmaker's shop that he called home. He slammed the door behind him and leaned against it, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. The email was still on his phone's screen, a luminous, unbelievable promise in the darkness of the hallway. He was going to London. He was going to sing in the final. His life, his ordinary, predictable, going-nowhere life, was about to change forever.Sleep was an impossibility. Alfie paced the thin, worn carpet of his living room, the email a glowing talisman in his hand. The room was small, furnished with a collection of second-hand furniture that always seemed to smell faintly of other people’s lives. A single window looked out over the betting shop’s garish sign, its flashing lights painting rhythmic, pathetic strobes across the walls. Usually, he hated that light. Tonight, it felt like a cheap imitation of the stage lights he was suddenly daring to imagine. He stopped pacing and sank onto the lumpy sofa, the springs groaning in protest. He read the email again. Then again. *The Grand Final*. The words were absurd. It was like finding a winning lottery ticket in a fish gut.

His first coherent thought, after the initial tidal wave of shock, was Gaz. He had to tell Gaz. He scrolled to his friend’s number, his thumb still unsteady, and pressed call. It rang twice before Gaz picked up, his voice thick with sleep and confusion. "Alfie? Mate, it's half-past midnight. Is the chippy on fire?"

"Gaz. I got in." Alfie’s voice was a strained whisper.

"In? In what? In trouble with Henderson again?"

"No. Not trouble. The show. 'Britain's Voice'." The words felt alien on his tongue, a language he wasn't yet fluent in. There was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by the sound of rustling, as if Gaz was sitting up in bed.

"You're having me on. Did you get a 'thanks but no thanks' email? I told you not to check 'em when you're pissed, mate. It's bad for the soul."

"No, Gaz. Not a rejection. The final. They want me in the final. In London. At the Palladium. Next Saturday." Alfie let all the words tumble out in a rush, fearing that if he held them in, they might vanish. The silence on the other end of the line stretched for a solid ten seconds.

"The… the final?" Gaz's voice was now completely awake, sharp with disbelief. "Not the auditions? Not some heat? The actual, telly, win-it-all final?"

"That's what the email says." A hysterical giggle escaped Alfie's lips. "It says 'The Grand Final'. It says they're 'delighted to inform me'. Gaz, I think I'm going to be sick."

"Holy shit," Gaz breathed. Then his voice exploded down the line, a roar of pure, unadulterated joy. "HOLY SHIT, ALFIE! YOU DID IT! YOU BLOODY WELL DID IT! I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU YOU WERE BETTER THAN THAT PREENING GIT WITH THE GUITAR!" Alfie had to hold the phone away from his ear, a wide, stupid grin spreading across his face. Gaz's unfiltered delight was the anchor he needed, the thing that made it feel real. "The Palladium! Mate, that's where the proper legends play! We're going to London!"

The 'we' hit Alfie with a sudden, cold dose of reality. London. Next Saturday. That was eight days. He had work tomorrow. He had a shift every day until next Friday. He had about sixty quid in his bank account until Henderson paid him at the end of the month. The dizzying euphoria began to curdle into a familiar, gut-wrenching anxiety. The path from this cramped flat to a stage at the London Palladium wasn't a straight line; it was a chasm, and he was standing on the edge with no idea how to cross.

"Gaz, hold on. How am I going to do this? I can't just… not go to work. Henderson will have my guts for garters. He's only just got the new summer menu sorted. He's counting on me."

"Sod Henderson!" Gaz yelled, his loyalty absolute. "This is it! This is the thing! You think proper rock stars worry about cleaning a grease trap? You call him in the morning. You tell him you quit. You tell him you're off to be famous and he can stuff his sea bass!"

Alfie winced, the image of Henderson’s purple, enraged face flashing in his mind. It wasn't that simple. The Salty Gull, for all its frustrations, was his life. The grease, the heat, the frantic rhythm – it was a cage, but it was a familiar one. And Henderson, for all his grumbling, had given him a job when no one else would. "I can't just quit, Gaz. I need the money. I need a reference if this all goes wrong."

"It's not going to go wrong," Gaz said, his voice softer now, but with an unshakable conviction. "Listen to me. This is your shot. Your one shot. You've been singing about it forever, in your bedroom, in that stinking kitchen, down the beach. Now it's happening. You can't let Henderson's temper or a few quid stand in the way. You just can't, mate. We'll figure it out. I'll lend you the train fare. You can kip on my cousin's floor in Stratford. We'll make it work. But you have to tell Henderson. Tomorrow."

The following morning felt surreal. The weak grey light of dawn seeped through the window, revealing the messy reality of the night before: an empty glass, the discarded work uniform smelling of fish and old fat, the phone lying face-up on the floor, still displaying the email. It hadn’t been a dream. The anxiety had coiled in his stomach, a cold, writhing knot. He walked to work through the awakening town, the familiar sights and sounds now seeming strange, as if he were viewing them through glass. The screech of gulls, the rumble of the first trawlers leaving the harbour, the smell of bacon from a greasy spoon café – it was the soundtrack to his life, a life he was about to irrevocably disrupt.

He pushed open the back door to the restaurant and was hit by the cold, stale air of the kitchen. It was his sanctuary and his prison, and the thought of telling Henderson he had to leave felt like a betrayal. He set about his morning prep in a daze, his hands performing the familiar tasks of chopping herbs and portioning fish while his mind raced. He was rehearsing lines, composing the perfect speech that would somehow make his boss understand. None of them sounded convincing. At nine o'clock, he heard the jingle of keys and Henderson's heavy tread in the corridor. It was now or never.

Henderson bustled in, his face already set in its customary pre-service scowl. "Morning. The mackerel looks a bit ropey, I want you to check it. And Brenda's called in sick, her lad's got the chickenpox, so we'll be a body down out front. It's going to be one of those days." He didn't look at Alfie, already focused on his list of worries.

"Mr. Henderson," Alfie started, his voice barely a croak. He cleared his throat. "Mr. Henderson, I need to talk to you."

Henderson finally looked up, his small, shrewd eyes narrowing. "What is it? You're not going to tell me you're sick as well?"

"No. It's… something's come up. I have to go to London. Next week."

Henderson stared at him blankly. "London? What for? Is it your mum?"

"No, she's fine. It's… a competition. A music competition. I'm in the final." Alfie felt his cheeks flush, the words sounding flimsy and ridiculous in the stark, professional environment of the kitchen.

Henderson let out a short, barking laugh. "A music competition? Is this a wind-up? Alfie, I've got a delivery of two hundred oysters coming in an hour and no one to cover the busiest weekend of the season. Whatever little sing-song you've got yourself into, it'll have to wait." He turned away, dismissing the conversation as a triviality.

"It can't wait," Alfie said, a new, firm tone in his voice surprising them both. "It's next Saturday. It's the final of 'Britain's Voice'."

The name hung in the air between them. Henderson slowly turned back, his expression shifting from irritation to disbelief. He looked Alfie up and down, at his lanky frame in the cheap, stained uniform, his messy hair, his anxious face. The idea was so preposterous that for a moment, he was speechless. "Britain's Voice? The one on the telly? You?"

"Yes," Alfie said, his chin lifting slightly. "Me."

Henderson grunted, running a hand over his bald head. He wasn't angry anymore; he just seemed baffled, as if one of his pans had suddenly started reciting Shakespeare. "Well, I'll be damned," he muttered, more to himself than to Alfie. He looked around the kitchen, at the rota pinned to the wall, at the prep lists. The cogs of his practical, business-oriented mind were turning. "Next Saturday. That's eight days. You want the whole week off?" The question was laden with the weight of a thousand logistical problems.

"I have to go, Mr. Henderson," Alfie said simply. It wasn’t a request. It was a statement of fact. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I know it's terrible timing. I'll work every hour God sends until I leave. I'll do all the prep for the weekend before I go. But I have to go."

There was a long silence, broken only by the hum of the fridge. Alfie held his breath. He saw his future branching into two distinct paths. In one, he stayed, he filleted the ropey mackerel, he shucked the two hundred oysters, and the song in his head quieted to a barely audible whisper. In the other… the other was a terrifying, brilliant unknown. Henderson sighed, a long, weary sound of resignation. He looked at Alfie, and for the first time, he didn't seem to be looking at his line chef, but at the young man he'd hired years ago.

"This isn't just a sing-song, is it, lad?" he asked, his voice softer than Alfie had ever heard it.

"No, sir. It isn't."

Henderson nodded slowly. "Right. Go on, then. Get out of here. Go to London. And for God's sake, don't make a fool of yourself." He turned his back before Alfie could see the reluctant, almost imperceptible hint of a proud smile on his face. "Now, check that bloody mackerel before it walks out of here on its own."The week that followed was a fever dream. Alfie existed in a state of suspended animation, his body going through the motions in the kitchen of The Salty Gull while his mind was a thousand miles away, rehearsing on a phantom stage. He worked with a manic energy that bordered on frightening, prepping and cleaning with a ferocious intensity. He was paying his dues, working off the guilt of his departure. The other kitchen porters and waitstaff moved around him with a new sense of awe. He was no longer just Alfie the line chef; he was Alfie who was going on the telly, a local boy touched by the bizarre magic of reality television. Brenda, her chickenpox-ridden son now on the mend, treated him like a visiting celebrity, bringing him cups of tea and asking for the tenth time if he’d met the famous judges yet.

On his last day, a humid Thursday afternoon, the kitchen was quiet. He had scrubbed the grill until his knuckles were raw and arranged the mise-en-place for the evening service with surgical precision. Henderson appeared in the doorway, holding a crumpled brown envelope. He didn't meet Alfie's eye. "Right," he grunted, shoving the envelope into Alfie's hand. "That's your wages. And a bit of an advance. For… expenses." Alfie opened it to see a thick wedge of notes, far more than he was owed. He looked up, speechless. "Don't look at me like that," Henderson snapped, his face turning a shade of plum. "I'm not having my restaurant represented by some scruffy urchin sleeping on a park bench. Get a decent haircut. And a taxi. Don't go on that bloody tube, you'll catch something." He cleared his throat, a loud, rattling sound. "Just… sing it like you do when you think no one's listening." He turned and walked away before Alfie could stammer out a thank you, leaving the young chef standing alone in the clean, silent kitchen, clutching an envelope full of unexpected faith.

The train journey to London was a jarring symphony of Gaz's relentless optimism and the frantic, fearful drumbeat in Alfie's own chest. Gaz had bought two cans of celebratory lager for the 9:05 service, and was already planning Alfie's victory party. He chattered about record deals and talk show appearances while Alfie stared out of the window, watching the familiar flat marshes and wide, grey skies of Suffolk dissolve into the cramped, cluttered suburbs of Essex and then London itself. With every mile, the knot in his stomach tightened. He was leaving behind the only world he knew, a world of grease-slicked tiles and the cry of gulls, for something vast and unknowable. The train plunged into the darkness of a tunnel and when it emerged, the world was a high-density chaos of brick and steel. They had arrived.

Liverpool Street Station was an assault on the senses. It wasn't the frantic, contained chaos of a dinner rush; it was a sprawling, roaring beast of a place, a tide of ten thousand strangers all moving with a purpose he couldn't comprehend. Alfie felt his shoulders hunch, trying to make himself smaller as Gaz, utterly unfazed, bulldozed a path towards the Underground. The descent into the tube was like entering the planet's circulatory system; the rush of wind, the screech of metal on metal, the oppressive warmth of too many bodies packed into a rattling carriage. Alfie gripped a pole, Henderson’s money safe in a zipped pocket, and felt profoundly, terrifyingly anonymous. He was just another face in the crowd, a nobody with a stupid, impossible dream. He caught his reflection in the darkened window, a pale, wide-eyed ghost superimposed over the blur of the tunnel walls, and he didn't recognise the person staring back.

Gaz’s cousin Kev lived in a tower block in Stratford that overlooked the sprawling Olympic Park, a monument to a global party that had packed up and left years ago. The flat itself was a shrine to magnificent inertia. Piles of takeaway menus and pizza boxes formed precarious sculptures on every available surface, and the air was thick with the scent of stale smoke and Lynx Africa. Kev, a man who seemed to be permanently attached to a PlayStation controller, greeted them with a monosyllabic grunt and a vague wave towards a sofa bed that looked as though it had witnessed several minor tragedies. "Help yourself to the fridge," he offered, his eyes never leaving the screen. "Think there's some cheese in there. Might be." This was it. The glamorous launchpad for his career. Alfie dropped his bag on the floor, the springs of the sofa bed groaning as he sat down, and felt a wave of homesickness so sharp it was like a physical pain. He would have given anything to be back in his kitchen, smelling of garlic and lemon cleaner.

That evening, as Gaz and Kev engaged in a noisy, virtual firefight on the television, a new email arrived from the production team. It was titled 'Britain's Voice: Grand Final Schedule'. Alfie opened it with a trembling finger. The message was a wall of terrifyingly efficient text. Call time: 0800hrs, The Palladium Stage Door. Rehearsal with house band: 0930-1015. Wardrobe fitting: 1100. Soundcheck: 1430. Pre-show briefing with producers: 1800. The sheer, relentless professionalism of it all made his head spin. It wasn't a pub sing-song; it was a military operation, and he was a raw, untrained recruit about to be thrown into the front line. The names of the other three finalists were listed at the bottom. He recognised one of them, a girl with a powerful voice and a sob story the show had been pushing for weeks. He was an unknown quantity. A wildcard. A fish-gutting nobody from Lowestoft. The imposter syndrome he’d been holding at bay crashed over him in a suffocating wave.

Later, long after Gaz’s snores had joined the hum of the city, Alfie stood by the smeared window of the flat. The view was a vast, glittering tapestry of light. Far in the distance, he could see the angry red glow of the city centre, the place where the Palladium stood waiting for him. He was a tiny, insignificant speck in this sprawling metropolis, a boy with one song and a voice that felt, at this moment, impossibly small. He tried to hum the opening bars of 'Starlight', the melody that had been his constant companion for months. But the notes wouldn't come. His throat was tight, his breath caught in his chest. The weight of it all—Gaz’s blind faith, Henderson’s money, the silent expectation of an entire town—pressed down on him. The dream had become real, and its reality was more terrifying than he could ever have imagined. He leaned his forehead against the cool glass, the city lights blurring through his tired, frightened eyes. He had eight days to find his voice again. Eight days to become someone worthy of that stage.The morning light that filtered through Kev’s grimy window was a pale, defeated grey. It did little to dispel the gloom in Alfie’s head. Sleep had been a series of fitful, anxious vignettes: he was on stage naked, he was serving fish and chips to the Queen, he was trying to sing but only the sound of a leaky tap came out. He woke on the lumpy sofa bed with the distinct feeling that he had been run over by a night bus. Across the room, Gaz was already dressed, a whirlwind of misplaced energy, trying to make toast on a grill pan because the toaster had apparently “given up the ghost last Tuesday”.

“Morning, rock star!” Gaz chirped, brandishing a blackened slice of bread like a trophy. “Big day! First stop, the Palladium. Then, the world! D’you want this bit? It’s only a little bit burnt.”

Alfie shook his head, his stomach churning too violently for food. The journey to the theatre was even more disorienting than the arrival. He followed Gaz’s confident stride through the labyrinthine corridors of the Stratford station and onto a Central Line train that was already heaving with commuters. Packed in, a stranger’s backpack digging into his spine, Alfie felt his anonymity as a physical weight. These people were all going to work, to offices and shops and building sites. He was going to a legendary theatre to pretend he was a singer. The absurdity of it was nauseating. He clung to the grab rail, the knuckles of his chef’s hands white, and focused on breathing.

They emerged into the different world of Oxford Circus. The air was thick with exhaust fumes and expensive perfume. The buildings were grand and old, their stone facades stained with history. Gaz, map-app held aloft like a holy relic, led them through a bewildering network of streets until they stood before it. The London Palladium. Alfie had only ever seen it on television. The grand, columned entrance was even more imposing in real life, a temple dedicated to entertainment. But they weren't going in that way. A brisk email from the production team had instructed him to a small, unmarked stage door in a narrow alley running alongside the theatre, an alley that smelled faintly of stale beer and rubbish. This felt more familiar. It was the service entrance.

A young woman with a clipboard, a headset clamped to one ear, and an air of supreme competence intercepted them the moment they stepped into the alley. "Alfie Finch?" she asked, her eyes ticking a box on her list before she’d even finished the question. "I'm Chloe, one of your artist liaison runners. You're right on time, well done." She gave Gaz a polite but firm smile. "Friends and family need to wait in the main green room, I'm afraid. Through the front entrance and ask at the box office. We'll bring Alfie to you when he has a break."

And just like that, he was separated from his anchor. Gaz gave him a clumsy, encouraging pat on the back. "Go on, mate. Smash it. I'll be watching!" he mouthed, before being gently but inexorably steered away. Alfie was alone, following Chloe through the stage door and into the belly of the beast. The sudden transition was jarring. The bright noise of the street was replaced by a hushed, purposeful quiet. The air inside smelled of dust, old wood, paint, and the faint, thrilling scent of electrical equipment. It was a corridor of organised chaos, lined with massive black flight cases stencilled with the names of bands and shows he vaguely recognised. It was a secret world, and he was trespassing.

Chloe led him down a narrow hallway whose walls were covered in framed, signed posters of past performers. Comedy legends, musical theatre icons, and rock stars stared down at him. He felt the immense weight of their talent, of the history soaked into the very floorboards. He was a line chef from Lowestoft. He had no right to be walking here. Chloe stopped before a door with a gold star and a small, freshly printed sign that read: 'Alfie Finch / Josh Miller'. His own name. Seeing it there, official and undeniable, sent another lurch of panic through him.

"This is you," Chloe said brightly. "Josh is your dressing room buddy, he's in wardrobe right now. Settle in. You've got band call on the main stage in fifteen minutes. Someone will come get you." She smiled, made a note on her clipboard, and disappeared down the corridor, her radio crackling with unheard instructions.

Alfie pushed the door open. The dressing room was small but professional, dominated by a large mirror surrounded by bare, powerful light bulbs. On the counter lay a bottle of water, a small bowl of fruit, and another copy of the terrifying schedule. He touched his name on the door, the flimsy piece of paper feeling more solid than he did. He sat in one of the chairs, staring at his reflection in the mirror. The harsh lights were unforgiving, highlighting the fatigue under his eyes and the cheap fabric of his t-shirt. He didn't look like a finalist. He looked like someone who had wandered in off the street looking for the toilets.

The door opened and a young man with impossibly perfect hair and a dazzlingly white smile walked in, humming a complex vocal run. "You must be Alfie! I'm Josh. Great to meet you, man," he said, extending a hand. His handshake was firm and confident. "Crazy, isn't it? The Palladium! I've been dreaming of this since I was in stage school." He was already at home, unpacking a vocal steamer and a collection of throat sprays. Alfie’s own bag contained a spare t-shirt, a toothbrush, and a crumpled packet of mints. The gulf between them felt a mile wide.

Before he could spiral further, another runner appeared at the door. "Alfie? Band call." It was time. His heart hammered against his ribs as he was led through another set of double doors and out onto the stage itself. The immensity of it hit him like a physical blow. Under the stark working lights, the stage seemed vast and empty. Beyond its edge, the auditorium was a colossal, yawning cavern of darkness, the thousands of red velvet seats waiting like silent, sleeping judges. A small cluster of musicians was set up in the centre of the stage, tuning instruments and chatting with the easy camaraderie of people who had done this a thousand times.

A man with a grey ponytail and a weary expression looked up from a sheet of music. "Alfie. I'm Marcus, the MD," he said, not bothering with a handshake. "We're running 'Starlight'. I've heard your demo. Simple enough. Key of G. We'll run it twice. Stand by." He gestured towards a microphone on a stand in the centre of the stage. Alfie walked towards it, his footsteps echoing in the cavernous space. This was it. The moment of truth.

He stood behind the microphone, his hands clammy. The band looked at him, their expressions neutral, waiting. He could see Chloe watching from the wings, her arms folded. Far behind her, he caught a glimpse of Gaz's anxious face peering around a curtain. He suddenly felt a million miles from the comforting fug of his kitchen. "Ready, kid?" Marcus called. Alfie nodded, his throat too dry to speak.

Marcus counted them in, "One, two, three, four…" The piano intro began. It wasn't the tinny trickle from his Bluetooth speaker; it was a rich, perfectly played melody that filled the entire theatre. It was beautiful. And it was terrifying. It was his cue. He opened his mouth, took a breath, and sang. The sound that came out was a pale, strangled imitation of his voice. It was thin, reedy, and hopelessly flat. All the power, all the emotion, was trapped behind a wall of fear in his chest.

The music faltered and stopped. Marcus held up a hand. "Woah. Okay. Nerves. I get it," he said, his tone bordering on impatient. "Take a breath. Support from the diaphragm. You know the drill. Let's go again. From the top."

The shame was a hot flush that spread from his neck to his face. They started again. The piano flowed, and again, Alfie choked. The notes were there, but they were weak, trembling things, devoid of life. He was pushing, straining, and it only made it worse. He could feel the musicians exchanging glances. He was wasting their time. He was a fraud, and they all knew it. The song was about reaching for the stars, but his voice couldn't even reach the first row of seats.

He stopped singing, dropping his head. "I'm sorry," he mumbled into the microphone. "I…"

"Don't be sorry, be better," Marcus said, his words sharp but not cruel. "We've got three other finalists to get through. One more time, kid. What's it going to be?"

Alfie closed his eyes, shutting out the cavernous dark and the judging faces. It was over. He couldn't do it. He was going to be sent home in disgrace. Then, through the fog of his panic, a voice. Henderson's gruff, complaining tone. *Sing it like you do when you think no one's listening.* The image of his kitchen swam into his mind. The heat. The noise. The dance. The stainless-steel counter. The cheap speaker. He pictured it, held onto it. He wasn't at the London Palladium. He was alone, after a long shift, the kitchen his kingdom. There was no Marcus, no band, no audience. Just him and the song.

He took a deep, shuddering breath, a breath that started low in his belly. He nodded, not to Marcus, but to himself. "Again," he said, his voice quiet but firm.

The piano began for the third time. Alfie didn't look up. He kept his eyes closed, locked in his private world. And he sang. He sang not for the band or the producers, but for the rows of hanging ladles and whisks. He sang of the small-town frustrations and the container ships on the horizon. The voice that emerged was not the strangled whisper from before. It was the one from the kitchen. It was clear and true, soaring into the vast emptiness of the theatre, filled with a longing so fierce it was almost painful. It resonated against the distant back wall and came back to him, pure and strong. He pushed into the chorus, the notes effortless now, his body remembering the music even if his mind had forgotten.

He held the final, high note of the crescendo, pouring every last ounce of relief and desperation and hope into it, letting it hang in the air until it faded naturally into the hum of the stage lights. For a moment, there was absolute silence. He slowly opened his eyes. The band wasn't looking at each other anymore. They were looking at him, their professional neutrality replaced by a quiet, surprised respect. Marcus was nodding slowly, a pen tapping against his chin. "Okay," he said, and the single word was a profound validation. "Okay, Alfie Finch. Now we've got something."The relief that flooded Alfie was so profound it left him weak at the knees. He leaned heavily on the microphone stand, his knuckles white, catching his breath in ragged gulps. The terror had receded, leaving behind a hollowed-out exhaustion and the faint, electric hum of adrenaline. Marcus finished making a note on his music stand and looked over at the band. The pianist gave Alfie a small, respectful nod, a subtle shift in the room's energy that was more validating than a standing ovation. Alfie had crossed some invisible line. He was no longer just a kid wasting their time; he was a musician.

"Better," Marcus said, his tone back to its default weary professionalism. "The emotional arc is there. You just need to access it without having a bloody nervous breakdown first. On the night, we're adding a string quartet for the last verse and the outro. It'll be big, so don't let it throw you. Ride the wave, don't get drowned by it. We'll run it again at the full soundcheck this afternoon. For now, go. You're done here." He turned away, already deep in conversation with the guitarist about a chord change, the brief, intense connection between him and Alfie severed. The moment was over. He was just another part of the machine again.

Chloe reappeared at his side as if summoned by an unheard cue, her smile a little warmer than before. "Well done," she said, her voice softer. "That was something. Wardrobe's next. They're waiting for you in room seven." As she led him back through the warren of corridors, the posters of the famous faces seemed less accusatory. He felt a flicker of connection, not to their fame, but to the sheer terror they must have felt standing on that stage for the first time. The terror was a rite of passage, and he had, by the skin of his teeth, survived it.

Wardrobe was a room of controlled chaos, a riot of colour and texture. Rails upon rails of clothes were crammed into a space not much bigger than The Salty Gull’s dry-store. A woman with a severe black bob, a dramatic sweep of eyeliner, and a tape measure draped around her neck like a stethoscope descended upon him. "Alfie! Darling! Seraphina," she announced, air-kissing the space somewhere near his left ear. "I've seen the footage. The brooding, windswept thing on the beach. Very Wuthering Heights. We can work with that. But the posture, my love, the posture is giving me 'apologetic heron'. We must fix that." She spun him around, her expert hands assessing his lanky frame. "Good shoulders, but you hide them. What is this?" she asked, plucking at his cheap t-shirt with two fingers as if it were a contaminated specimen.

For the next half-hour, Alfie was a mannequin. He was pushed and pulled, measured and draped in a bewildering array of fabrics. Seraphina held up a sequined jacket that glittered aggressively under the lights. "Too 'Eurovision runner-up'," she mused, tossing it aside. She considered a floral shirt. "Too 'garden party at your nan's'." She talked about his 'narrative' and his 'brand'. "You're the authentic one, the diamond in the rough. The voice of the people. We can't have you looking like you've been styled. We need to look 'artfully un-styled'. It's a very fine line, darling." Alfie, who had worn a variation of the same jeans and t-shirt for ten years, just nodded, utterly bewildered. Finally, she settled on a simple, dark, beautifully cut jacket, a soft grey t-shirt made of a material he’d never felt before, and dark jeans that somehow made him look taller and less awkward. She stood him in front of a full-length mirror. "Now," she said with a satisfied sigh. "Now, you look like someone." Alfie stared at his reflection. It was him, but it wasn't. The clothes didn't feel like a costume, but like an upgrade, a glimpse of a person he could potentially become. It was almost as unnerving as the rehearsal had been.

He was led to the green room, a large, bright space with sofas, a television quietly showing a daytime quiz show, and a long table laden with a buffet that Alfie’s professional eye immediately dismissed as an insult to catering. Gaz spotted him from across the room and practically vaulted over a sofa to get to him, his face a wild canvas of relief and excitement. "Mate! You did it! You actually did it! I was watching from the wings, I thought my heart was going to come out of my chest when you first started, I thought, 'oh no, he's lost it', but then… bloody hell, Alfie! It was like you flicked a switch! The whole band sat up! I saw it!"

Alfie managed a weak smile, grabbing a bottle of water from the table and ignoring the pallid triangles of sandwiches. "It was close," he admitted, the memory of his throat closing up still vivid. "I nearly bottled it." He sank into a sofa, the soft leather a world away from Kev's tragic sofa bed. He could see the other finalists dotted around the room. Josh Miller was laughing with his immaculately dressed parents, radiating an effortless confidence that made Alfie’s stomach ache. Maya, the young girl with the big voice, was surrounded by a boisterous group of siblings who were systematically demolishing the buffet. They all seemed to belong here.

"Don't worry about them," Gaz said, following his gaze and seeming to read his mind. "They're stage school kids. They've been training for this their whole lives. You're the real deal. You've been training for it in a greasy kitchen. It's a better story." Alfie wasn't so sure. A story wouldn't help him hit a high C if his throat seized with fear again. He looked at the bland sandwich in Gaz’s hand, the dry white bread and single slice of sweaty ham. He thought of the fresh-off-the-boat mackerel, the crispness of perfectly rendered sea bass skin, the honest, hearty food he knew how to create. That world felt solid, real, and a million miles away. This world of 'narratives' and 'artfully un-styled' clothes and bad sandwiches felt flimsy and terrifying, a dream from which he might wake up at any moment.The afternoon stretched on, a strange, timeless limbo suspended between moments of high-stakes terror. The green room buzzed with a low-grade, frantic energy that Alfie found more draining than a twelve-hour shift. People laughed too loudly, checked their phones too often, and nibbled at the edges of curling sandwiches with no real appetite. Josh Miller held court near the coffee machine, recounting a hilarious anecdote about a disastrous audition for a West End show, his audience of family and production assistants hanging on his every word. He moved with a liquid ease, a man born to be the centre of attention. Alfie felt himself shrinking into the deep sofa, wishing he could become invisible, a ghost haunting the edges of someone else’s big day. Gaz, sensing his retreat, kept up a running commentary of encouragement, a constant, loyal murmur in his ear. “Look at him, all jazz hands and anecdotes. He’s got the patter, but you’ve got the soul, mate. That’s what people remember.”

After a while, Josh broke from his circle and ambled over, his smile as bright and wide as a stage light. "Alfie, right? Great sound this morning, man. Really raw, authentic." He sat on the arm of the sofa, leaning in conspiratorially. "So, where did you train? Your vocal control is interesting. It’s not classical, not really contemporary musical theatre either. I can't quite place it." The question was friendly, a simple piece of professional curiosity, but to Alfie it felt like an interrogation, a test he was bound to fail. He felt his cheeks flush. "I, uh, didn't really train anywhere," he mumbled, staring at the scuffed toes of his trainers. "I'm a chef. I mostly sing to the extractor fan." Josh blinked, his smile faltering for a fraction of a second as he processed this. Then he let out a loud, slightly forced laugh. "A chef! That is brilliant! The singing chef! The producers are going to love that. What a narrative!" He slapped Alfie on the shoulder, a gesture of camaraderie that felt more like a brand being seared into his skin, and wandered off to find a bottle of sparkling water. Alfie was left with the word ‘narrative’ echoing in his head. He wasn't a person, he was a story. A marketable angle.

The call for the full soundcheck came as a relief, a release from the social anxiety of the green room. Walking back towards the stage, Alfie felt a different kind of dread, but it was a familiar one now. This time, as he stepped out from the wings, the stage was no longer a vast, empty space. It was a functioning beast. Banks of lights glowed in deep blues and warm golds, casting long, dramatic shadows. Technicians swarmed across the floor, taping down cables and testing smoke machines that hissed periodically. And to the side of the main band, seated on elegant chairs, was the string quartet. Four musicians, two men and two women, dressed in concert black, were quietly tuning their instruments. Their presence instantly changed the atmosphere, lending a gravitas that made Alfie’s throat tighten.

He took his place at the microphone, his hands sweating again. He looked out into the darkness where Marcus was a silhouette at a brightly lit sound desk. He could just make out Chloe and a few other production staff standing in the aisle, their faces upturned and expectant. This was it. No more warm-ups. This was a dress rehearsal for the biggest moment of his life. He closed his eyes, forcing away the image of the thousand-seat auditorium, and conjured the smell of old onions and frying fish. He heard the sizzle of the pan, the clatter of a docket being clipped to the rail. The kitchen. Home. "Ready, Alfie?" Marcus's disembodied voice boomed through the monitors. Alfie nodded, opened his eyes, and kept his gaze fixed on a single red light on a camera at the back of the stalls. It was his new extractor fan.

The piano intro began, rich and full. Alfie took his grounding breath and sang. The first line was steady, stronger than it had been in the morning. He wasn't fighting his fear anymore; he was singing alongside it. He poured the memory of the cold North Sea wind and the frustration of his small, damp flat into the melody. He felt the band lock in with him, their rhythm a solid foundation beneath his voice. Then, as he reached the final verse, he heard it. A single, soaring violin note entered, followed by the rich, warm harmony of the cello. The strings swelled beneath his voice, lifting it up, wrapping around the simple melody and transforming it into something epic and profound. A jolt, pure and electric, shot through him. The song wasn't just his anymore. It was bigger, more beautiful than he had ever imagined it could be. He leaned into the microphone, his voice climbing with the crescendo, no longer a shout of frustration but a declaration of hope. The music carried him, and for the first time, he felt truly powerful, as if he belonged in the heart of that magnificent sound.

The final note, amplified by the soaring strings, echoed through the empty theatre, shimmering in the air before fading into a perfect silence. Alfie stood, his chest heaving, his eyes wide with the shock of what had just happened. He had not just sung his song; he had lived it, right there on the stage. From the darkness of the stalls, a single pair of hands started clapping. It was Marcus. Then a few more of the crew joined in. It wasn't a thunderous ovation, but it was real. From the sound desk, Marcus's voice crackled over the speakers, devoid of its earlier impatience. "That's the one, Alfie. Do that tonight, just like that, and you'll be fine." A thumbs-up, starkly illuminated by the desk light, was the only other signal he needed. Walking off the stage, he felt a calm, steady confidence begin to seed itself in the pit of his stomach. It wasn't borrowed, and it wasn't a costume. It was his.

The final hours before the live show passed in a strange, surreal blur. Alfie was steered into a chair while a woman with kind eyes and surprisingly cold hands applied a subtle layer of foundation to his face, telling him it was just to stop him from "looking like a ghost" under the lights. Another person attacked his hair with a cloud of hairspray that smelled of coconuts, taming its usual rebellious state into something that looked artfully tousled. He sat through it all in a state of Zen-like calm, holding onto the memory of the strings, the way the music had lifted him. He thought of Henderson, gruffly pressing the envelope of cash into his hand. He thought of the regulars at The Salty Gull, of the fishermen on the docks at dawn. They weren't a weight of expectation anymore; they were his anchor. They were his truth, the grit and salt that made his song what it was.

Gaz found him back in the dressing room, the air now thick with the scent of perfume, hairspray, and raw nerves. Josh was doing a series of loud, elaborate vocal warm-ups, his voice echoing down the corridor. Gaz didn't have any big, encouraging speeches this time. He just looked at Alfie, who was now fully dressed in the clothes Seraphina had chosen for him, his face subtly defined by the makeup, his hair looking effortlessly perfect. The transformation was complete. Gaz’s usual bravado was gone, replaced by a quiet, almost reverent awe. "Blimey, Alfie," he said softly. "You look the part. You really, really do." Alfie met his friend's eye in the mirror, and in that shared look was everything: the years of dreaming in pubs, the dare, the unbelievable journey from the windswept beach to this star-emblazoned door. He felt his phone buzz in his pocket and knew, without looking, it would be a good-luck text from his mum. He decided not to read it yet. He'd call her after, no matter what happened. This last part of the journey, this final walk, he needed to do on his own.

A sharp rap on the door, and Chloe’s head appeared. Her face was all business, her voice tight with adrenaline. "Five minutes, everyone. Final checks. To the wings, please." This was it. The world seemed to slow down and speed up all at once. The walk from the dressing room towards the stage was the longest of his life. He could hear the low roar of the live audience now, a sound like the sea, a thousand strangers waiting on the other side of the curtain. He passed Josh, who gave him a tense, professional nod. He passed Maya, who was bouncing on the balls of her feet, her eyes wide. Then he was there, in the deep shadow of the wings, the place he’d watched from all day. The stage was ablaze with light, a beautiful, terrifying island in a sea of darkness. His heart was a frantic percussion against his ribs, the rhythm of the dinner rush magnified a thousand times. He was Alfie Finch, a chef from Lowestoft. And he was about to step into the starlight.The host’s voice, impossibly smooth and amplified to the heavens, boomed through the speakers into the wings. "He’s a chef from a small seaside town who scrubs grills by day and dreams of stardom by night. He sent in a video on a dare, never believing it would lead him here. Please welcome to the stage, the incredible singing chef, Alfie Finch!" A roar went up from the unseen crowd. Alfie flinched. The 'singing chef'. It was a cartoon character, a two-dimensional cutout of his life. Yet, it was the handle they had given him, the hook on which his entire future now hung. Chloe, her face illuminated by the glow from the stage, gave him a final, sharp nod. "That's you. Go."

He took a single step, breaking from the comforting shadow of the wing and into the light. It was a physical blow, a wall of heat and white-hot brilliance that made him squint. The roar of the audience intensified, a living, breathing entity that pressed in on him from all sides. It wasn't like the cacophony of the kitchen; it was a vast, oceanic sound that threatened to swallow him whole. He couldn't see faces, only a vast, shimmering darkness punctuated by the electric blue constellations of a thousand mobile phones held aloft. His worn trainers felt clumsy on the polished black stage as he made the longest walk of his life towards the lone microphone stand, a single, slender anchor in a swirling universe of overwhelming sensation. His mind went blank. Every piece of advice, every mental rehearsal, evaporated in the searing heat of the moment.

He reached the microphone, his hand slick with sweat as he wrapped it around the cool metal stand. The roar of the crowd began to subside, replaced by an expectant, terrifying hush that was somehow louder than the noise. The silence was a vast, empty canvas on which he was about to either paint a masterpiece or spill the paint. He could see the silhouettes of the four famous judges at their desk, their faces unreadable, their judgment imminent. The red tally light on the camera directly in front of him glowed like a malevolent eye. This was it. The point of no return. Then, the simple, searching piano intro of 'Starlight' began, a sound so familiar it was like a friend’s voice in the dark. He closed his eyes, shutting out the lights, the judges, the silent, waiting thousands. He summoned the smell of industrial-strength lemon cleaner and the rhythmic drip, drip, drip of the leaky tap. He was alone. It was after midnight. The shift was over.

He took a breath, not a shallow, panicked gasp, but a deep, grounding breath that started in the pit of his stomach. He sang. The first line was quiet, fragile, but it was there. It was on key. It was his. “*Grey dawn on the water, another ship pulls from the bay…*” He pushed the image of the Lowestoft harbour out into the darkness, a piece of his soul offered up to the void. He felt a tremor in his voice, the last vestiges of his terror, but he sang through it, leaning into the imperfection, making it part of the song’s raw honesty. He sang of the small frustrations, the dead-end shifts, the feeling of being stuck while the world moved on without him. He opened his eyes, and the fear was gone. The blinding lights were just lights. The audience was no longer a monster, but a vast darkness waiting to be filled. He wasn't begging for their approval; he was telling them his story.

As he moved into the song’s powerful bridge, he felt the full force of the band kick in behind him, a solid wall of sound that he could lean against, that supported him. He let his voice grow, no longer holding back. Then came the moment he’d been waiting for, the moment he’d clung to since the soundcheck. The strings entered. A single, soaring violin note cut through the air, followed by the deep, resonant heartache of the cellos. The music swelled, lifting his voice, wrapping around it, transforming his simple melody into an anthem. A jolt of pure, unadulterated joy shot through him, a feeling so intense it was almost painful. He forgot the cameras. He forgot the competition. He forgot everything but the music. His voice climbed with the magnificent swell of the orchestra, no longer a quiet plea but a soaring, triumphant declaration. He poured every last ounce of hope, of frustration, of a lifetime of dreaming into the final line. “*…and I’ll catch a starlight in my hand!*”

He held the final, impossible note, his eyes squeezed shut, his body vibrating with the force of it. He held it until his lungs burned and his vision swam, letting it hang in the supercharged atmosphere of the theatre before finally letting it go. And in its wake, there was silence. A complete, profound, heart-stopping silence that seemed to last an eternity. In that single, silent heartbeat, Alfie stood with his head bowed, his chest heaving, his ears ringing with the ghost of the music. He had nothing left. He had given them everything. Then, it began. Not as a ripple of applause, but as an explosion. A unified, spontaneous eruption of sound, a tidal wave of cheering and clapping and stamping feet that crashed over the stage and washed through him, shaking him to his very core.

Stunned, he lifted his head, blinking against the lights and the sudden, hot sting of tears that blurred his vision. The vast, anonymous darkness had transformed. Through the shimmering veil of his tears, he could see them. Thousands of people, on their feet. A sea of illuminated faces, their mouths open in cheers, their hands a blur of motion. He saw a woman in the third row, her makeup smudged, openly weeping. He saw a group of young men, who looked like they’d be more at home in a pub watching football, roaring their approval. And there, halfway back in the stalls, he saw Gaz. He was standing on his chair, his face a grotesque, beautiful mask of pure elation, screaming so hard it looked like he might burst. The colossal roar resolved itself into thousands of individual shouts of connection. They had heard him. They had understood. A choked sob that was half-laugh escaped his throat. He wasn’t a singing chef or a novelty act. He was a boy from a small town who had sung a song about his life, and in the heart of the great, anonymous city, a thousand strangers were singing it back to him.The host, a man with a tan so deep it looked lacquered on, glided across the stage and wrapped a startlingly firm arm around Alfie’s shoulders. The roar of the crowd was a physical pressure, a vibration that seemed to run up from the floorboards and into Alfie's bones. He felt himself swaying slightly, a sapling in a hurricane, and the host’s grip was the only thing holding him upright. The man’s aftershave, a sharp, expensive citrus scent, cut through the smell of stage smoke and Alfie’s own sweat. It was another detail in a kaleidoscope of sensory information that was threatening to short-circuit his brain.

"Alfie Finch, ladies and gentlemen!" the host boomed into his microphone, his voice a buttery, professional counterpoint to the raw emotion still hanging in the air. "Alfie, I think it's safe to say you've left this entire theatre, and millions watching at home, absolutely speechless. Take a look at this!" He gestured out at the standing, cheering auditorium. Alfie tried to focus, to take it in, but the sight of so much collective joy directed at him was too vast to comprehend. It was like trying to look directly at the sun. He just blinked, the hot tears finally spilling over and tracing clean paths through the light dusting of stage makeup on his cheeks.

"Let's go to the judges," the host announced. "Cheryl, you look emotional." The camera panned to the famous pop star on the panel. Her eyes were glistening, and she held a hand to her chest. "Alfie, that wasn't a performance," she said, her voice thick with feeling. "That was a confession. That was truth. In this industry, we see so much polish, so much perfection, but sometimes we forget that the most powerful thing in the world is just one person telling their story. You did that tonight. You took us all back to your seaside town, and you made us feel every single bit of it. It was just… breathtakingly honest."

Next was the notoriously cynical rock producer, a man who had made a career out of deflating egos. He leaned back in his chair, slowly steepling his fingers. "Technically," he began, and Alfie’s heart plummeted, "it was all over the place. Your breathing was ragged at the start, you pushed the top notes a little sharp, you were clearly terrified." He paused, letting the criticism hang in the air. "And it was absolutely bloody brilliant. It was real. It was visceral. I don't want to hear a perfectly produced version of that song. I want to hear that version, the one with the grit and the fear and the hope all mixed up in it. You’re not a contestant, you’re an artist."

Alfie’s mind reeled. He had just been praised for his terror. The host turned to him, the perfect white teeth flashing in a benevolent smile. "Alfie, you’ve heard the judges. You’ve seen this reaction. What is going through your head right now?" The question was simple, but Alfie’s brain couldn't find the words. The journey from the grease trap to this moment was too far, too fast. He looked out into the shimmering darkness, thought of Henderson, of Gaz, of the leaky tap, of the song that had been a secret hum in the back of his head for so long. He brought the microphone to his lips, his hand trembling. "I… I just… thank you," he stammered, his voice a raw, broken whisper. "Thank you for listening." It was all he had. But in the renewed roar from the crowd, it seemed to be more than enough.

He was guided off the stage in a daze, the transition back into the wings like waking from a vivid dream. The sound of the audience was abruptly muffled, replaced by the crackle of radios and the urgent whispers of the crew. Chloe was there, her usual clipboard-and-headset efficiency momentarily forgotten. Her eyes were wide, and she gave him a smile that was entirely genuine. "That was a moment, Alfie. A real moment," she said, her voice quiet with something that sounded like awe. Before he could respond, he was swept along in a current of people. A burly cameraman patted him hard on the back. A sound technician gave him a fervent thumbs-up. He was a piece of driftwood on a tide of adrenaline and congratulations, too overwhelmed to do anything but be carried along.

The green room was a scene of pandemonium. The quiet, tense atmosphere of before had been shattered. Everyone was on their feet, clustered around the large monitors, watching the show’s host throw to a commercial break over a shot of the judges still shaking their heads in disbelief. The moment Alfie stepped through the door, a cheer went up. But he only saw one person. Gaz, his face blotchy and tear-streaked, broke away from the crowd and launched himself at Alfie, wrapping him in a fierce, bone-crushing hug. He was shouting something incoherent right into Alfie’s ear, a string of swear words and superlatives that was the most comforting sound in the world.

"They were on their feet before you even finished the last note!" Gaz finally yelled, holding Alfie at arm’s length, his hands gripping his shoulders as if to check he was real. "The woman next to me was sobbing, mate! Properly sobbing into her handbag! You didn't just sing a song, you broke them! You bloody well broke them!" Alfie could only laugh, a strange, hysterical sound that was tangled up with a fresh wave of tears. He felt Gaz's hands on his shoulders, a solid, grounding weight in the swirling madness. This was real. His friend was real. The rest felt like a bizarre, beautifully lit hallucination. He sank onto the sofa, Gaz protectively beside him, as the other finalists were called to the stage one by one. He barely registered their performances, the powerful ballads and upbeat pop numbers washing over him. His own song was still echoing in his ears, the swell of the strings, the thunder of the applause, a symphony that had rearranged his world. His phone, which he'd left on the coffee table, buzzed insistently. Gaz picked it up. His eyes widened. "It's Henderson," he said, and read the message aloud. "'Saw it on the pub telly. The punters went quiet. You didn't make a fool of yourself.' Blimey," Gaz breathed. "That's basically a love letter from him." A watery grin spread across Alfie’s face. It was perfect.The afterglow of Henderson's message, a small, solid piece of home in the glittering chaos, was all Alfie had to hold onto. The final contestant, a slick pop-R&B singer with dance moves as polished as his shoes, finished his number to a powerful, well-earned round of applause. The green room, which had briefly felt like Alfie's personal victory party, fell back into a taut, collective silence. The air grew thick with the unspoken question. Alfie sat frozen on the sofa, Gaz a silent, solid presence beside him, his hand resting on Alfie’s shoulder. Josh Miller was pacing near the door, a caged panther of ambition, running scales under his breath. Maya was huddled with her family, their hands linked in a tight, prayerful circle. The shared dream that had brought them all here had now narrowed to a single, sharp point, and they were all balanced upon it.

A runner with a headset and weary eyes appeared in the doorway, her voice cutting through the tension like a blade. "Finalists to the stage, please. It's time." A collective intake of breath seemed to suck the remaining oxygen from the room. It was a slow, funereal procession back through the labyrinth of corridors. No one spoke. The strange, unspoken camaraderie of the terrified had settled over them. They were no longer competitors so much as fellow astronauts about to be strapped into the same rocket, destination unknown. As they waited in the wings, Josh caught Alfie’s eye. The dazzling, professional smile was gone, replaced by a look of raw, naked nerves. He gave Alfie a short, sharp nod, a gesture of respect between two soldiers in a trench. In that moment, Alfie felt a pang of empathy for the stage school kid. For all his polish, he was just as terrified as Alfie was.

They were herded out into the blaze of the lights and arranged in a line, a tableau of modern British hope: the pop-star-in-waiting, the soulful teenager, the polished professional, and the singing chef. The roar of the audience was a constant, deafening hum. Alfie stood woodenly, feeling the intense heat of the lights on his face, trying to find Gaz in the vast, churning sea of faces but seeing only a blur. He was intensely aware of Maya beside him, her small hand trembling uncontrollably, and he had the absurd impulse to reach out and steady it. The host took his place in the centre of them, a master of ceremonies at the precipice of four different futures, his smile unwavering. The giant screens behind them flickered to life, showing a whirlwind montage of their 'journeys'. Alfie saw a fleeting image of himself on the Lowestoft beach, his hair a mess in the wind, his voice thin against the sound of the waves. It felt like a clip from a film about a complete stranger.

"Four incredible singers," the host began, his voice dripping with gravitas. "But there can be only one winner. The votes have been counted and verified." He paused, letting the suspense build. "One of these talented people is about to be awarded a life-changing record contract and be crowned the winner of Britain's Voice 2023." The studio music swelled, a dramatic, string-laden score designed to manipulate a nation's heartstrings. A drumroll began, a frantic, thudding rhythm that echoed the panicked hammering in Alfie's own chest. He stared out at the single red camera light, his unwilling focal point. He tried to brace himself for the inevitable disappointment, for the return journey to the real world. He pictured putting his apron on, the familiar weight of it, the smell of clean steel and old grease. He could go back. He hadn't made a fool of himself. That was the real prize. He was ready to hear Josh’s name. He had made his peace with it.

"The winner," the host boomed, his voice seeming to shake the very foundations of the theatre, "is..." The pause stretched, a taut, agonizing silence where a million hopes were born and died. Alfie closed his eyes. "…Alfie Finch!"

The name, his name, slammed into him with the force of a physical blow. For a split second, it was just a sound, meaningless. Then the world erupted. A cannon somewhere in the lighting rig fired, and a blizzard of silver and gold confetti rained down, catching the light like a million tiny stars. The roar from the audience was a solid wall of sound that vibrated through the floor and up into his soul. Maya, sobbing with what looked like relief and genuine happiness for him, threw her arms around his neck. Josh was clapping him on the back, his polished smile now one of genuine, if slightly pained, congratulation. The host was holding a large, glittering trophy towards him, but Alfie’s arms seemed to be made of lead. He couldn't move. He just stood there, frozen, as the glittering storm swirled around him.

Suddenly, a familiar force cannoned into him, breaking the spell. It was Gaz, having somehow breached security, his face a grotesque, beautiful mask of pure elation and streaming tears. He hugged Alfie with a ferocity that lifted him off the ground, shouting a stream of joyous, incoherent profanities directly into his ear. The opening chords of 'Starlight' blasted through the sound system, impossibly loud, the orchestral strings soaring into the stratosphere. The host shoved the heavy trophy into Alfie’s numb hands and pushed the microphone towards his face. He was supposed to sing the winner’s reprise, but he couldn't form a thought, let alone a note. He opened his mouth, but all that came out was a choked, breathless sob. It didn't matter. The crowd sang it for him. A thousand voices, then thousands more, joined together, carrying his melody, his words, his story. He stood there, a lanky, overwhelmed chef clutching a ridiculous, glittering prize, confetti sticking to his tear-stained face, Gaz's arm slung around his shoulders like an anchor, and listened as a sea of strangers sang his life back to him. His ordinary, predictable, going-nowhere life was over. It had changed forever, right here, in a storm of light and sound and shimmering paper.The golden storm subsided, leaving Alfie adrift in a sea of overwhelming sensation. His departure from the stage was not a walk but an abduction; he was swept up in a human current, a whirlwind of producers, technicians, and publicists, all talking at once, their voices a meaningless babble against the roar still echoing in his ears. He caught a final, frantic glimpse of Gaz being held back by a stern-faced security guard before he was pulled through a set of double doors and the sound of the world was cut in half. The heavy trophy was an awkward, alien weight in his hands, its metallic coldness a strange counterpoint to the heat flushing his skin. Confetti was tangled in his hair and stuck to his damp cheeks, tiny, glittering reminders of a moment he already suspected he hadn't fully experienced.

He was steered down a brightly lit corridor and pushed, not gently, through a doorway into a fresh hell. A wall of blinding light hit him, the rapid-fire explosions of a dozen camera flashes turning the air white. A cacophony of shouted questions assaulted him from all sides. "Alfie! How does it feel to be Britain's Voice?" "Are you going to buy a new restaurant?" "What's the first thing you'll do with the prize money?" "Have you quit your job yet?" He recoiled, raising the trophy instinctively as a shield against the onslaught. He felt like a nocturnal animal dragged into the midday sun, his senses overloaded, his mind a blank slate of panic. He tried to form a coherent sentence, but his throat was raw and his brain was still ringing with music. "It's… mad," he stammered, the word hopelessly inadequate. "I… I don't know." His clumsy, honest bewilderment seemed to delight them, their flashes intensifying, their shouted questions coming faster. He was a story, and they were feasting on it.

Just as he felt his knees might buckle, he was extracted from the press pen as efficiently as he had been thrown into it. Chloe, her professional calm fully restored, guided him to a quiet, air-conditioned room that felt like another planet. The silence was so abrupt it was jarring. A man in a suit so sharp it looked like it could cut glass rose from a leather chair. He was older, with silvering hair and eyes that were not congratulatory but appraising, like a jeweller examining a newly discovered gem for its commercial potential. "Alfie. I'm Julian Croft. I run the label," he said, his voice smooth and cool. He shook Alfie’s hand, his grip firm and brief. "Congratulations. You have a very marketable narrative. We need to strike while the iron is hot. The single, 'Starlight', drops digitally this Friday. We need you in the studio, first thing Monday morning, to lay down the final vocal. Car will pick you up at eight. My assistant will be in touch with a full schedule. Any questions?" Alfie stared at him, his mind struggling to keep up. Monday morning. A schedule. This wasn't a dream coming true; it was a business plan being executed. He shook his head, unable to form a single question from the million that were suddenly swarming in his head.

He was eventually deposited back in what had been his dressing room, though it now looked as though a hurricane had passed through it. Chloe handed him his phone, which felt strangely light without the weight of his future attached to it. "You have twenty minutes before the car comes for you and your friend," she said. "Try to take a breath." He nodded mutely and unlocked the screen. It came alive with a blinding cascade of notifications, a digital tidal wave of texts, missed calls, and social media alerts. He saw Henderson’s name, his mum’s, and hundreds of others he didn’t recognise. Ignoring them all, he pressed the call button next to 'Mum'. She answered on the first ring, her voice a choked, trembling sob. "Alfie? Oh, my boy. Is that really you?" He leaned against the wall, the cool surface a welcome anchor, and closed his eyes. "It's me, Mum," he whispered, his own voice cracking. "Oh, Alfie," she wept, her relief and pride a palpable force down the line. "The whole pub, they were standing on the tables. Shouting your name. Your dad… well, even he had to wipe his eyes. We are so, so proud of you." The simple, unvarnished love in her voice was the first thing that had felt entirely real since he’d stepped off that stage. It was the thing that finally broke through his shock, and he found himself sobbing quietly into the phone, the sound of his mother’s voice from his small town the only thing holding him together in the heart of the storm.

True to Chloe's word, a sleek black car was waiting in the same alleyway where he had arrived that morning, a lifetime ago. Gaz was already inside, looking utterly lost in the plush leather interior. The heavy door closed with a soft, expensive thud, sealing them in a cocoon of silence and new car smell. The trophy sat on the seat between them, glinting in the passing streetlights. They drove through the neon-drenched streets of London, two boys from Lowestoft on a journey to a destination neither of them could have imagined. For a long time, they said nothing, just watching the vibrant, unfamiliar city slide past the tinted windows. Finally, Gaz let out a long, slow breath. "So," he said, his voice hushed with awe. "This is what it's like on the other side." Alfie looked from Gaz’s wide, disbelieving eyes to the heavy, ridiculous trophy, and then back out at the endless stream of strangers on the pavements, living their ordinary lives, completely unaware that his had just been shattered and remade.

The car purred to a stop outside a hotel whose entrance was a grand symphony of polished brass and marble, a liveried doorman stepping forward to open the car door. Alfie stepped out onto the pavement, the cool night air a shock to his system. He was still clutching the trophy, his knuckles white. As he walked through the revolving doors into the hushed, cavernous lobby, he caught sight of his reflection in a vast, gilt-edged mirror. He saw a stranger. A young man with artfully messy hair, wearing clothes that weren't his, his face pale with exhaustion beneath a faint layer of makeup, holding a gaudy symbol of a victory he couldn't yet comprehend. It was Alfie Finch, the winner of Britain's Voice. It was the singing chef. He stared at the reflection, and the reflection stared back, and for the life of him, he had no idea who that person was.The hotel room was a silent, beige box of impossible luxury. The door clicked shut behind them, muffling the distant sounds of the city and sealing Alfie and Gaz in a vacuum of thick carpet and hushed, air-conditioned stillness. A bed, vast and unnervingly white, dominated the space, its surface so pristine it looked like no human had ever touched it. Opposite, a flatscreen television the size of a small boat was mounted on the wall. Gaz let out a long, low whistle that seemed to be swallowed by the sheer opulence of the room. “Blimey, Alfie,” he breathed, his voice a reverent whisper. “This is a bit different from Kev’s sofa bed.”

Alfie didn’t answer. He walked, as if in a trance, to the floor-to-ceiling window. The view was breathtaking, a sprawling galaxy of silent, sleeping lights that stretched to a horizon he couldn’t see. It was London, laid out before him like a prize, but it felt cold and utterly indifferent. He was holding the trophy, its weight a solid, grounding presence in his numb hands. He looked around for somewhere to put it down, his eyes settling on a polished mahogany desk. He placed it carefully on the gleaming surface, where it stood looking absurdly out of place, a gaudy piece of stagecraft in a room designed for serious, wealthy adults. It wasn't a symbol of his victory; it was an accusation, a glittering reminder of the impossible standard he had just set for himself.

While Alfie was locked in his silent appraisal of the abyss, Gaz had launched into a giddy exploration. He bounced on the edge of the bed, his knees sinking deep into the mattress. “Feel this! It’s like trying to sleep on a marshmallow! My back wouldn’t know what to do with itself.” He strode into the bathroom, a cavern of marble and chrome, and let out a whoop of delight. “Alfie! There’s a tiny telly in the wall by the bath! And the shower’s got more knobs than the cockpit of a plane!” He reappeared, his face alight with the thrill of discovery, and knelt before the small, panelled fridge beneath the desk. He swung the door open as if revealing a pirate’s treasure chest. His face fell. “Oh. Eight quid for a tiny bag of nuts. And twelve quid for a little bottle of gin. They’re having a laugh.”

The mundane reality of the minibar prices seemed to pierce the bubble of Alfie’s shock. He sank onto an armchair that was so soft it felt like it was trying to absorb him. He wasn’t thinking about the view or the tiny television in the bathroom. He was replaying the words of Julian Croft, the man from the record label. *Marketable narrative. Studio on Monday. Strike while the iron is hot.* The dream he had nurtured in the quiet, lonely hours in the kitchen had, in the space of an evening, been corporatised. It wasn't a passion anymore; it was a product. The pressure to win had been immense, but this new pressure, the pressure to deliver, to be a professional, to justify the faith and the money and the sheer, dumb luck of it all, felt a thousand times heavier.

Gaz, his brief infatuation with the minibar over, came and perched on the arm of Alfie’s chair, his boisterous energy finally subsiding as he took in his friend’s pale, exhausted face. "You alright, mate? You’ve gone a funny colour. You look like you did that time you ate a dodgy scallop." Alfie shook his head, running a hand through his confetti-flecked hair. He finally gave voice to the fear that was coiling in his gut. "What if that was it, Gaz?" he asked, his voice barely a whisper. "What if that performance was a fluke? A one-off. I was running on pure terror and adrenaline. What if I get in that fancy studio on Monday, with that Julian bloke watching me through the glass, and nothing comes out? What if the singing chef was just a one-night-only special?"

"Don't be a div," Gaz said, his tone firm, cutting through the self-pity. "You've been singing like that for years. I've heard you sing that song a hundred times. In your bedroom, down the beach, in that stinking kitchen with a spatula for a microphone. The only thing that changed tonight is that other people finally got to hear it. You've got this. You just need to eat something." He picked up the glossy room service menu from the desk, flicking past pages of foie gras and lobster thermidor with a dismissive grunt. "Right. Here we are. 'The Gull Burger'. Bet it's not as good as Henderson's. We're having two of them. And chips. Proper food." It was a small, defiant act of normalcy in a world that had become utterly abnormal.

While they waited, Alfie knew there was one more piece of his old life he had to deal with. His stomach clenched as he scrolled through his phone and found Henderson's number. His thumb hovered over the screen, the impending conversation feeling more daunting than facing the judges. This wasn't just quitting a job; it was closing the door on the only version of himself he truly knew. Taking a deep breath, he pressed the button. It rang twice before Henderson’s familiar, gruff bark answered. "Finch. Figured you'd call. Suppose you won't be in on Monday to clean the grease trap, then."

The lack of surprise in his boss's voice threw him. "Mr. Henderson, I… I'm so sorry about the short notice," Alfie stammered, falling back into the familiar cadence of a subordinate. "I didn't expect…" Henderson cut him off with a grunt. "Save it. Saw the whole thing on the telly down The Anchor. Place went quiet for once. You didn't make a fool of yourself." There was a pause, a brief moment where the line was filled with the faint sound of pub chatter and a clinking glass. "Just remember where you learned to graft, lad. This new lark, it's not all starlight and sequins. It's work, same as any other job. Probably harder. Don't let those London sharks eat you alive." It was the closest to a blessing Alfie knew he would ever get from the man. "I won't, Mr. Henderson," he said, his throat tight. "Thank you." He hung up the phone, feeling a profound sense of release. He was officially unemployed. The line cook from The Salty Gull was now just a memory.

When the room service arrived, wheeled in on a trolley by a silent waiter who averted his eyes, it was almost comical. Two plates, each holding a burger and a neat stack of chips, were hidden under magnificent, polished silver cloches. Gaz lifted one with a theatrical flourish, revealing the food beneath. "Behold," he deadpanned. "A twenty-five-quid burger." They ate in a strange, subdued silence, the familiar, comforting taste of fried potatoes and grilled meat an anchor in the surreal maelstrom of the night. It was the first thing Alfie had eaten all day, and with each bite, he felt a fraction of his strength return.

Much later, with the remains of their absurdly expensive meal sitting on the trolley by the door, Gaz finally succumbed to the day’s emotional and alcoholic marathon. He was fast asleep, sprawled diagonally across his half of the enormous bed, snoring softly. But sleep, for Alfie, was an impossibility. His mind was a frantic carousel of lights, sounds, and Julian Croft’s cool, appraising eyes. He stood by the window again, the trophy a lonely, glinting sentinel on the desk beside him. He looked at his phone, at the single, stark email from Julian's assistant that had arrived while he was talking to his mum. It was a schedule for the coming week. Call times, studio addresses, press interviews, stylist meetings. His life, for the foreseeable future, was no longer his own. It was a list of appointments in a city he didn't know. The river of light below was endless and indifferent. He was the winner. He was the boy who had caught a starlight in his hand. And he had never, in his entire life, felt so profoundly and terrifyingly alone.Morning arrived not with the familiar cry of a Lowestoft gull, but with a weak, grey light filtering through a gap in the heavy blackout curtains, illuminating a silent tableau of the night before. Gaz was a lump under a pristine duvet, dead to the world. The silver cloches sat on the trolley like abandoned space helmets. And on the desk, the trophy caught the first sliver of dawn, its gaudy gold a silent, mocking testament to the new reality. Alfie had not slept. He had spent the long, dark hours replaying the performance, the applause, the quiet, assessing look in Julian Croft’s eyes, until the memories had frayed into a meaningless, buzzing anxiety. His new life, as detailed in the email on his phone, was scheduled to begin in less than three hours, and he felt as prepared for it as he would be to cook a state banquet for the King.

He peeled himself from the armchair, his body stiff and aching, and moved into the marble bathroom. The ridiculously complex shower, with its array of nozzles and dials, was a baffling piece of engineering. He managed to produce a jet of scalding water, then a blast of icy cold, before settling on a lukewarm compromise. He stared at his reflection in the steam-fogged mirror. The stranger from the night before was still there, but now he looked pale and haunted, the last traces of makeup giving him the bruised, weary look of a prize fighter after a gruelling bout. He ignored the plush white robe hanging on the door and pulled on his own clothes from the day before: the familiar, worn jeans and the soft, faded t-shirt. It was a small, almost pathetic, act of defiance, a desperate attempt to feel like himself in a world that was rapidly trying to remake him.

At half past seven, he gently shook Gaz’s shoulder. His friend surfaced with a groan, his face a mess of pillow creases and confusion. "Wha…?" he mumbled, his eyes struggling to focus. Then memory dawned, and a slow, stupid grin spread across his face. "Morning, winner," he slurred, sitting up abruptly. "Is it time for a rock-star breakfast? Are we ordering champagne and scrambled eggs?" The disconnect between Gaz’s holiday camp enthusiasm and Alfie’s funereal dread was a vast, unbridgeable chasm. "The car's coming at eight," Alfie said, his voice flat. "I've got to go to the studio." Gaz swung his legs out of bed, instantly ready for the next adventure. "Right, let's get a move on then! I'm not missing seeing you in a proper recording studio!" Alfie had to deliver the next blow, another small, sharp cut that separated his new life from his old one. "The email said… it's just for me, Gaz. 'Artist only'." The grin on Gaz’s face faltered, replaced by a flicker of disappointment that he quickly tried to hide. "Oh. Right. Yeah, of course. Professional. Got it. Well, you go and be the 'artist'. I'll… I'll guard the big shiny trophy."

The ride to the studio was a silent, solitary journey through the city’s roaring morning traffic. The driver, a man with a face as impassive as a stone carving, didn't speak, navigating the chaos with an unnerving calm. Alfie felt less like a person and more like a fragile, valuable package being delivered. They pulled up not outside a grand, impressive building, but a graffiti-marked brick warehouse in a part of London that was all railway arches and industrial units. The only sign of its purpose was a small, unmarked black door with a formidable-looking keypad. This was not the glamour of the Palladium; this was the engine room, a place stripped of all frippery. This was where the work was really done.

Inside, the contrast was immediate. The noisy, grimy street gave way to a hushed, climate-controlled world that smelled of new electronics, expensive coffee, and faint, lingering cigarette smoke. A young man with tired eyes led Alfie through a maze of corridors into the main control room. It was like the bridge of a starship, dominated by a vast mixing desk covered in a galaxy of glowing lights, faders, and buttons. Beyond a wide pane of soundproof glass was the vocal booth, a small, solitary cell containing nothing but a microphone on a stand. A man with a carefully curated three-day stubble and a t-shirt that probably cost more than Alfie’s weekly wage turned from the desk. "Alfie. Mark. I'll be producing the single," he said, his smile friendly but his eyes all business. "Great performance last night. Truly. The whole country’s buzzing. Our job today is to bottle that lightning. No pressure."

The phrase hung in the air as Alfie was led into the vocal booth. The heavy door clicked shut behind him, and the world went completely silent. It was the most profound silence he had ever experienced, a dead, unnerving quiet that made the blood thrum in his ears. He was alone, sealed in a glass box, a specimen under a microscope. Mark’s voice, disembodied and unnaturally clear, crackled into the headphones he wore. "Okay, Alfie. Let's just do a level check. Sing me the first verse of 'Starlight'." He took a breath, the air in the booth sterile and tasteless, and sang. The voice that came out was a stranger's. It was thin, precise, and utterly dead, a technically correct but emotionally vacant ghost of the song. He could hear its pathetic thinness in his headphones, and a hot wave of shame washed over him. This was exactly what he had feared.

He tried again, and again. He pushed for the power he’d had on stage, but his voice strained, the notes sounding forced and sharp. He tried to access the emotion, but the sterile silence of the booth offered no purchase for his memory. There was no grease, no heat, no roar of a crowd or frantic rhythm of the dinner rush. There was only the sound of his own inadequate voice and the patient, expensive silence from the other side of the glass. The panic began to rise, cold and sharp. The lightning was gone. The bottle was empty. He was a fraud, and he was being found out on his very first day. "I… I can't," he finally croaked into the microphone, his voice thick with failure. "It's not there. I'm sorry."

Mark’s voice came back, still infuriatingly calm. "Don't be sorry. Just stop trying to sing the hit. It doesn't exist yet. We’re going to make it now. Forget the song. I want you to talk to me. Close your eyes. Describe the back door of The Salty Gull at five in the morning." Confused, Alfie haltingly began to speak, describing the rusted handle, the overflowing bins, the smell of stale beer and the sharp, clean scent of the pre-dawn sea. Mark kept probing, his voice a gentle, insistent scalpel. "Tell me about the colour of the North Sea in winter. Tell me what it feels like to have grease burns on your arms. Tell me about the first time you played 'Starlight' for Gaz and he told you it was brilliant."

Alfie talked, his voice losing its strained, apologetic edge as the memories took over. He wasn't in a glass box in London anymore; he was leaning against a cold brick wall in a cobbled alley, watching his breath plume in the cold air. He was on a windy beach, his eyes watering, his voice fighting the gulls. He was in his kitchen, after midnight, a cheap speaker his only audience. The producer was mining his life, excavating the raw materials of his song, and as Alfie spoke, he felt the knot of panic in his chest begin to loosen. "Okay," Mark said softly, his voice a conspiratorial whisper in the headphones. "You're there now. You're back in that kitchen. The whole world is asleep, and this is just for you. Sing it to me from there." Alfie closed his eyes, took a deep breath that tasted, for a fleeting moment, of salt and old onions, and sang.

It was not the voice from the stage, filled with soaring, adrenalized power. It was something quieter, more intimate, more desperate. It was the voice of a young man singing in a silent kitchen, his only audience a row of hanging ladles, pouring all of his frustration and fierce, secret hope into a melody. He sang it all the way through, his eyes shut tight. When he finished, the silence that followed was not empty, but full. He’d done it. He had found a way to sing his truth, even in this sterile, silent room. "Okay, Alfie," Mark’s voice crackled, and for the first time, there was a genuine warmth in it. "Let's go again." He sang it three more times, each one stripping away another layer of artifice, until he was left with the raw, aching heart of the song. He was emotionally scoured, hollowed out, but he had delivered. As he stumbled out of the booth, blinking in the low light of the control room, he saw Julian Croft leaning against the far wall, a silent observer. The label boss didn't smile. He simply gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. "The car is waiting," he said, his voice as cool and crisp as a winter morning. "You have a photo shoot for the single cover at one o'clock." The machine was already moving on. There was no time to celebrate or recover. Just the silent black car, waiting to transport him to the next scheduled piece of his new life.The black car was a sensory deprivation tank on wheels. Sealed inside its silent, leather-scented interior, Alfie felt the chaotic energy of London recede to a distant, irrelevant hum. The city passed by the tinted windows as a frantic, silent film, a blur of red buses, harried faces, and towering glass buildings that scraped at the grey sky. He was a ghost being ferried from one sterile environment to another, the emotional evisceration of the recording session leaving him hollow and numb. He leaned his head against the cool glass, his own reflection a pale, translucent mask superimposed over the anonymous cityscape. The next appointment, the photo shoot, felt less like an opportunity and more like the next station on an assembly line, another part of the process of being packaged and prepared for public consumption. He was no longer a person who had won a competition; he was the product, and today was his first day in the factory.

The studio was another exercise in industrial anonymity, a vast, whitewashed warehouse in a cobbled mews that smelled of damp brick and diesel fumes. Inside, however, it was a different universe, a blindingly white space that seemed to have no corners, just a seamless curve of infinity. It was painfully bright, a stark contrast to the dark, womb-like intimacy of the recording booth. A whirlwind of focused, fashionable people descended on him the moment he stepped through the door. A skeletal young man with meticulously ripped jeans thrust a lukewarm coffee into his hand, while a woman with a cloud of pink hair began brushing his face with a soft powder, tutting about the "translucence" of his skin under the studio lights. The air was thick with the scent of hairspray and a high-octane anxiety that was completely different from the pre-show nerves at the Palladium. This was the cold, clinical anxiety of aesthetics.

Seraphina, the stylist from the theatre, emerged from behind a towering rail of clothes, her dramatic eyeliner and severe bob making her look like a high-fashion high priestess. "Alfie, darling! There you are!" she exclaimed, air-kissing him again. "You look drained. Perfect. The tortured artist vibe is very now. We're leaning into it." She pulled him towards the clothes rail, her talk of 'narratives' and 'brand identity' returning with a vengeance. "We need to cement the image. The authentic, working-class poet. Nothing too polished. I've found this incredible vintage denim jacket – cost a fortune – and this Henley, it's cashmere but it looks like old cotton. The art is in the artifice, my love." She dressed him like a doll, turning him this way and that, her expert hands adjusting a cuff here, a collar there. He felt the scratch of a hidden tag, the unfamiliar softness of a garment designed to look old and worn. He was being fitted into a costume for the role of himself.

The photographer, a wiry Frenchman named Antoine with restless energy and eyes that seemed to see right through him, circled Alfie like a predator. He was all frantic motion and staccato, French-inflected commands. "Alfie! Stand here! The light, it loves you, but you, you are fighting it! Relax the shoulders! Think of your little town, the grey sea, the melancholy! Give me the boy who dreams of the horizon!" Antoine’s directions were abstract and impossible. How was one supposed to *look* like they were dreaming of a horizon? Alfie’s body, already stiff with exhaustion and self-consciousness, tightened further. He felt his shoulders hunch into their familiar, protective curve. He was a chef used to the solid reality of hot pans and sharp knives; this world of performed emotion and curated authenticity was a foreign language he couldn't speak.

The session was a slow, excruciating failure. Antoine grew increasingly frustrated, his commands becoming sharper, more exasperated. "Non, non, non! This is not it! You are giving me nothing! You are a block of wood! I see a boy waiting for a bus, not a star! Where is the passion? Where is the fire I saw on the television? Are you leaving it in the kitchen with your little fishes?" The crew stood in silent, awkward witness to Alfie’s humiliation. A familiar hot shame crept up his neck. He was a fraud. He had fluked it last night. He could sing with his eyes closed, lost in his private world, but he couldn't conjure an ounce of that feeling on demand for a camera. He felt a desperate urge to put his apron back on, to hide behind the heat and noise of the stove, a world where his worth was measured in tangible, well-cooked plates of food, not in his ability to project 'longing'.

Finally, Antoine threw his hands up in a gesture of Gallic surrender. "Fine! C'est fini! Forget it! Just… stand there. Don't do anything. I need a cigarette." He turned his back, waving a dismissive hand at his assistant. In that moment of release, the intense pressure vanishing as Antoine walked away, Alfie’s entire body sagged. His shoulders slumped forward, he let out a long, ragged breath he hadn't realised he’d been holding for an hour, and his head dropped, his gaze falling to the scuffed toes of his trainers. He looked, for the first time all day, simply and completely himself: a tired, overwhelmed young man who was hopelessly out of his depth. *Click.* The sound was so soft it was almost lost in the vastness of the studio. Alfie looked up. Antoine hadn't walked away. He stood twenty feet off, his camera held low, an almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips. He lifted the camera to show Alfie the small digital screen on the back. "Voilà," he whispered, his voice soft with discovery. "There he is. The starlight boy."

The rest of the shoot proceeded in this new, strange mode. Antoine had abandoned all direction. "Don't look at me. Don't think about the camera. Just be in the room," he commanded quietly. He moved around Alfie, his camera a silent, unobtrusive observer, capturing the moments between poses: Alfie rubbing his tired eyes, leaning against a wall, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance. It was less a photo shoot and more a quiet surveillance. Alfie wasn't performing anymore; he was simply enduring, a fact that seemed to be exactly what the photographer wanted. When it was finally, abruptly over, the energy in the room dissipated instantly. The crew began packing away lights and backdrops. Antoine was already huddled with his assistant, scrolling through hundreds of images on a laptop. No one said goodbye. Alfie was handed a bottle of water by the pink-haired makeup artist and told the car was waiting outside. His purpose had been served.

The silent black car delivered him back to the grand hotel as the afternoon light began to fade, casting long shadows across the city. The lobby was hushed and smelled faintly of lilies. He rode the silent lift up to his floor, the heavy trophy still sitting on the desk where he had left it, a lonely, glittering sentinel. The room was empty. A note, scrawled on a piece of hotel stationery, was propped against a pillow on the vast, empty bed. 'Gone for a wander to see the sights. Might find a proper pub. Don't wait up! - Gaz'. Alfie stood in the centre of the silent, cavernous room and felt an emptiness so profound it was like a physical ache. He had spent the day being dissected, recorded, styled, and photographed. He had given them his voice, his memories, his image, and his exhaustion. They had taken everything they needed to build their product, and now he was back in his gilded cage, alone with the ghost of the boy he used to be.The silence in the hotel room was a living thing. It pressed in on Alfie, heavier than any blanket, more suffocating than the fug of a busy kitchen. The sounds of his old life – the frantic percussion of the dinner rush, the sizzle and spit of the pans, even the incessant drip of the leaky tap – had been a constant, familiar soundtrack. Here, there was nothing. Just the whisper of the air conditioning and the faint, distant hum of a city that was utterly indifferent to his existence. He walked around the vast, anonymous space, touching the smooth, cold surfaces of the furniture as if to prove they were real. He picked up the heavy, glossy room service menu, its descriptions of elegant, complicated food a mockery of the honest, hearty meals he knew how to cook. He felt a phantom muscle memory in his hands, the urge to chop, to stir, to create something tangible and real from a pile of raw ingredients. But there was nothing to cook, no one to feed. His purpose had been stripped away.

He flopped onto the enormous bed, the pristine duvet sighing under his weight, and stared at the ceiling. The elation of the win, the brief, brilliant explosion of joy on stage, had already receded, leaving behind the dull, aching hangover of shock. He was the winner. He had a record deal. He had done the impossible. So why did he feel like he had lost something fundamental? He picked up the remote control, a sleek, minimalist object with too few buttons, and switched on the giant television. It flickered to life, and after a moment of channel-surfing, he found it. His own face, blown up to an unnerving size, stared back at him. It was a news segment. A well-groomed presenter was talking over a clip of his final performance, her voice bright and clipped. “The Cinderella story that has captured the nation’s heart,” she announced. “From fish-fryer to pop sensation, Alfie Finch’s meteoric rise is the stuff of fairy tales.” They cut to a pre-packaged segment showing grainy mobile phone footage of Lowestoft’s harbour, followed by an awkward interview with a woman who used to be a regular at The Salty Gull. “Oh, Alfie’s a lovely boy,” she said, squinting into the camera. “Always very quiet. You wouldn’t have thought he had it in him.” He watched, mesmerised and appalled, as his life was condensed into a neat, two-minute narrative. He wasn’t a person; he was a human-interest story, a collection of convenient plot points. The fish-fryer. The quiet boy. The fairy tale. He switched the television off, plunging the room back into silence.

Gaz returned late that night, bursting into the room like a gust of wind from the real world. He was flushed with cheap lager and the thrill of a day spent being a tourist, his hands full of a carrier bag from a tacky souvenir shop. "Alfie! You're not going to believe it! I saw the Crown Jewels! Well, I saw the outside of the building where they keep them. The queue was mental. And I found this proper old-man pub in Soho where the carpet was sticky and everything smelled of history and stale ale. It was brilliant!" He was alive with an energy that Alfie couldn't begin to match. He pulled a miniature, glitter-encrusted model of a red telephone box from his bag and presented it to Alfie with a flourish. "For your mantelpiece. When you get a mantelpiece." Alfie took the ridiculous object, its cheap plastic feeling flimsy and unreal in his hand. He tried to explain his own day, the sterile silence of the vocal booth, the cold appraisal of the camera, the stylist’s talk of ‘artfully un-styled’ clothes. The words sounded hollow and complaining, the language of a different species. Gaz listened, his brow furrowed, but his eyes were already glazing over. The gulf between their experiences was too wide to bridge with words.

Their first attempt to venture out together the next day was a disaster. Alfie, desperate for fresh air and a sense of normalcy, had suggested a walk. They decided on a large park, hoping to lose themselves in its green expanse. For the first twenty minutes, it was perfect. The air was cool and damp, smelling of earth and wet leaves. They walked in comfortable silence, two friends from Lowestoft wandering through a London park, the familiar rhythm of their friendship reasserting itself. Then, it happened. A girl, no older than fifteen, stopped dead in front of them, her hand flying to her mouth. “Oh my god,” she whispered, her eyes wide. “You’re… you’re him. You’re Alfie Finch.” Her friend, alerted by the sudden stop, let out a small shriek. Alfie froze, his stomach turning to ice. The girl fumbled for her phone. “Can I… can I please get a selfie?” she stammered. Alfie, his face fixed in a pained, awkward smile, found himself posing while Gaz, snapping into the role of proud minder, tried to organise the shot. The small interaction was a stone tossed into the quiet pond of the park. Ripples spread outwards. A few other people slowed down, staring. A man walking his dog did a double-take. Within minutes, a small, curious crowd had formed. The pointing and whispering began. Alfie felt their eyes on him, a thousand tiny pinpricks against his skin. He was no longer a person walking in a park; he was an exhibit. He mumbled an apology and, grabbing Gaz’s arm, began a hasty retreat, the feeling of being watched following him all the way back to the grand, anonymous hotel that had now become his only sanctuary.

Back in the gilded cage, an email from the label was waiting. The subject line was stark: ‘Starlight_Cover_Final.jpg’. Alfie opened the attachment with a sense of profound dread. The image that filled the screen was the one Antoine had captured in that accidental, unguarded moment of defeat. It was him, his head bowed, his shoulders slumped in exhaustion, his eyes fixed on the floor. His face was a mask of weariness, but in the slump of his shoulders and the tension in his hands, there was a story of defiance, of endurance. The artifice of the expensive, pre-worn clothes was secondary to the raw, unvarnished truth of the expression. It was the most honest picture of him that had ever been taken, and it was about to be seen by millions. “Wow,” Gaz breathed, peering over his shoulder. “That’s proper moody, that is. You look like you’re thinking deep thoughts. It’s brilliant.” Alfie stared at the image, at his own private despair so beautifully lit and framed, and felt a cold, unnerving chill. His vulnerability had been packaged. It was his brand.

That evening brought the next scheduled step in his transformation. The single was getting its world premiere on the biggest radio station in the country. Alfie and Gaz sat on the edge of the vast, perfect bed, the radio on the bedside table tuned and waiting, the air in the room thick with anticipation. The DJ, a man with a voice as smooth and fast as motorway traffic, finished a song and launched into his intro. “And now, for the one you’ve all been waiting for! The winner of Britain’s Voice, the singing chef from Suffolk who blew us all away! Turn it up, this is Alfie Finch with his debut single, ‘Starlight’!” The familiar piano intro trickled from the small speaker, but it was different. It was clearer, brighter, each note perfectly defined. Then his voice came in. It was his, but it had been polished to a high sheen. Mark, the producer, had worked his subtle alchemy, smoothing the ragged edges, layering the harmonies, adding a deep, resonant bass that thrummed beneath the melody. The chorus exploded from the radio, bigger and more powerful than he had ever imagined it, the strings swelling into a cinematic, heart-wrenching crescendo. It was a hit. It was undeniable. It was perfect. And as he listened to his own perfected voice filling the silent hotel room, Alfie felt a complex, gut-wrenching mix of dizzying pride and a profound, inexplicable sense of loss. He had caught the starlight, but in the process, its light had changed him, refracting his own simple truth into something brighter, bolder, and no longer entirely his own.The final, perfectly engineered notes of 'Starlight' faded, leaving a vacuum in their wake that was instantly filled by the DJ’s manic enthusiasm. “There you have it! The sound of the summer, I’m calling it now! That was Alfie Finch, and that track is available to download and stream everywhere!” Gaz let out a whoop that seemed to shake the very windows of the opulent room. He scrambled off the bed and started pacing, fizzing with a vicarious energy that Alfie couldn’t even begin to access. “It’s a monster, Alfie! A proper monster of a hit! That bit with the strings? My god, it gives you goosebumps! They’re going to play that everywhere! In shops, in pubs, on building sites! You’re going to be sick of the sound of your own voice, mate! Isn’t that brilliant?”

Alfie could only nod, a slow, robotic gesture. His phone, lying on the duvet between them, began to vibrate. It didn’t just buzz with a single notification; it entered a state of continuous, frantic tremor, the screen a strobing, multicoloured mess of alerts from every social media platform he had ever reluctantly joined. Gaz grabbed it, his eyes wide with glee as he began to read aloud. “Twitter’s gone mental! #AlfieStarlight is trending number one in the UK! Listen to this one: ‘Cried in the car on the way home from work. That song just gets it.’ And this one: ‘The singing chef has cooked up a banger!’” He was scrolling furiously, a town crier announcing news of a victory from a battle Alfie felt he hadn't even fought. Each tweet, each glowing comment, felt like a report from a distant country. Alfie felt a strange, profound detachment, as if he were watching a highlights reel of someone else’s success. The number one next to 'Starlight' when Gaz opened the digital music chart wasn’t a validation; it felt like a grade, a mark of how well his soul had been packaged and sold.

Gaz finally looked up from the glowing screen, his face a mask of pure, uncomplicated joy. “Can you believe this? It’s actually happening! Everything we used to talk about, down The Anchor, getting pissed and dreaming about it. It’s real!” He saw the look on Alfie’s face then, the quiet, hollowed-out expression that didn't match the national jubilation happening on his phone. Gaz’s smile faltered. “What’s wrong? Don’t you like it? It sounds amazing.” The question was so simple, so logical, that it was impossible to answer. How could he explain that the perfection was the problem? That in polishing his story, they had sanded away the very grain of it? “It’s not that I don’t like it,” Alfie began, his voice quiet. “It’s just… it’s so big. It doesn't sound like me in my kitchen anymore.” Gaz’s brow furrowed in confusion. “But that’s the point, isn’t it? You’re not in your kitchen anymore! You’re in a posh hotel with a number one song! This is the win, Alfie! This is what it looks like!” He gestured around the room, at the vast bed, the silent, expensive furniture, the glittering trophy on the desk. For Gaz, these were the spoils of war. For Alfie, they were the bars of his new cage.

Before the chasm between them could widen further, Alfie’s phone buzzed with an incoming call, the screen displaying a name he didn't recognise but a title he was beginning to dread: ‘Julian Croft’s Office’. He answered, his heart sinking. A brisk, efficient female voice spoke without preamble. “Alfie, congratulations on the number one. The initial figures are unprecedented. We need to capitalise on the momentum. You’re booked on the national breakfast television show tomorrow morning. Live interview and performance. A car will be at your hotel at five AM. Be ready.” The line went dead. Alfie lowered the phone, the brief, clinical instructions a cold slap of reality. Five AM. Live television. There was no time to process, no time to think or feel or breathe. The machine was in motion, and he was strapped to the front of it.

That night, sleep was a foreign country he couldn't reach. He lay in the vast, empty half of the bed while Gaz snored softly beside him, a soundtrack of blissful ignorance. Alfie was trapped in a loop, the polished, perfect version of 'Starlight' playing endlessly in his head, interspersed with the cold, clinical commands of the record label. He wasn't Alfie Finch, the kid who sang on the beach anymore. He was Alfie Finch™, the brand, the narrative, the singing chef with the number one single. His authenticity, the very quality that had won him the competition, was now his most carefully managed and marketable asset. He felt like an imposter in his own skin, playing a role that was becoming more demanding with every passing hour. He was an honest chef in a world that dealt in illusions, and he was beginning to suspect that the main course on the menu was him.

The five AM alarm was a brutal, screeching summons. In the pre-dawn darkness, Alfie showered and dressed in a daze, pulling on the ‘artfully un-styled’ clothes Seraphina had decreed were now his uniform. Gaz mumbled something from the depths of the duvet and rolled over, leaving Alfie to face the day alone. The silent black car was waiting, a familiar hearse for his old life, ready to transport him to the next performance. The television studio was a brightly coloured, aggressively cheerful set that felt flimsy and fake, a child’s drawing of a living room. He was bustled through makeup, where his tired, sleepless face was once again spackled into a semblance of youthful energy. He was handed a mug of tea he didn't drink and a copy of the morning’s newspapers, all of which featured his face on the front page, his story splashed across the headlines. He couldn’t bring himself to read them.

He was led to the stage for a soundcheck, a smaller, less intimidating version of the Palladium, but in some ways more terrifying. There was no full band, no sweeping orchestra. It was just him, a guitarist, and a pianist, tasked with recreating the intimacy of the record for a live television audience of millions. He had to perform the hit. He had to be the artist from the radio, not the terrified boy from the kitchen. As he stood on his mark, the relentlessly upbeat theme music of the show blaring through the studio, he felt a new kind of dread. The terror of the contestant, the fear of failure and judgment, was gone. It had been replaced by something colder, more professional: the crushing weight of expectation. He wasn't here to prove himself anymore. He was here to deliver the product. The floor manager began to count down on his fingers. "Ten, nine, eight…" A presenter with a dazzling smile gave him a thumbs-up. The camera’s red light blinked on. He was live. He was on. And he had to sing.The floor manager’s fingers disappeared one by one, a silent, inexorable countdown to his public execution. Three. Two. One. The aggressively cheerful theme music faded, and the female presenter, her smile a terrifyingly perfect arc of white, turned her full attention to him. “And we are so thrilled to have him with us live in the studio this morning! He is the man of the moment, with the number one single in the country. Please welcome, Alfie Finch!” A smattering of polite, studio-mandated applause broke out from the crew and a few members of the production staff seated just off-camera. The sound was thin and pathetic after the roaring hurricane of the Palladium. It felt like a parody. Alfie stood alone on the small, circular stage, the guitarist and pianist flanking him like elegantly dressed prison guards. The red light on the camera opposite him glowed, a soulless, unblinking eye demanding its pound of flesh. He was exposed, pinned like a butterfly to a board under the bright, heatless lights.

The pianist began the intro, the notes clean, precise, and utterly devoid of the soul they had possessed in the theatre. It was a perfect copy, a flawless imitation. Alfie closed his eyes, his default defence mechanism, a desperate attempt to retreat into the one space they couldn't invade. He tried to summon the kitchen, the comforting fug of garlic and old grease, but the memory was faint, obscured by the scent of hairspray and floor polish. He tried to recall the terror of the Palladium, the adrenaline that had propelled his voice into the stratosphere, but that too was gone, replaced by a hollow, weary professionalism. All that was left was the memory of the vocal booth, the sterile silence, and Mark the producer’s quiet, insistent voice, mining his past for raw material. He wasn't singing from a place of hope or fear anymore. He was singing from a place of memory, an echo of an emotion he had already spent.

He opened his mouth and sang. The voice that emerged surprised him. It was not the soaring, triumphant instrument of his victory. It was quieter, laced with a profound, bone-deep weariness he wasn't even trying to hide. The performance wasn’t a desperate reach for the stars; it was a mournful look back at the ground he had left behind. He sang of the grey dawn on the water not as a symbol of a trapped existence, but with a strange, aching nostalgia. The longing in his voice was still there, sharp and clear, but its object had shifted. He was no longer a boy dreaming of escape. He was an exile, dreaming of home. The stripped-back arrangement laid his voice bare, every fragile, melancholic quaver exposed. He finished the final note, letting it fade into the studio air, and opened his eyes. The performance had cost him something, a sliver of the remaining truth he had left. It was a beautiful, heartbreaking rendition, and it was entirely, devastatingly real.

For a moment, there was a stunned silence, a beat longer than was comfortable for live television. Even the relentlessly cheerful presenters seemed momentarily thrown, their practiced smiles faltering. Then, the female host recovered, her voice a little softer than before. “Just beautiful. Spine-tingling. You could have heard a pin drop in here. Alfie Finch, everyone!” As the polite applause returned, Alfie was guided from the small stage to an uncomfortably low, brightly-coloured sofa that seemed designed to swallow him whole. The two presenters flanked him, their practiced warmth creating an invisible cage. “So, Alfie,” the male host began, his tone avuncular. “Just incredible. A week ago, you were cleaning grills in a seafood restaurant in Lowestoft. Now you have the number one song in the country. Has any of it sunk in yet?” The question was a neatly packaged prompt, an invitation to perform the requisite awe and gratitude. Alfie looked from one beaming, expectant face to the other. His mind was a blank. “No,” he said simply. “Not really. It’s… mad.”

The presenters, masters of their craft, expertly filled the void his monosyllabic answer had created. “It is mad! A proper fairy tale!” the woman chirped. “And we know you were a chef, but your old boss, Mr Henderson, he said you were a grafter. What do you miss most about the old job? I bet it’s not the seventy-hour weeks!” They both laughed, a warm, inviting sound. Alfie felt a sudden, unexpected flash of defiance. They were laughing at his life, at the hard, honest work that had defined him. They saw it as a joke, a grim 'before' picture to his glittering 'after'. The Salty Gull, for all its flaws, had been his kingdom, a place of tangible skill and real graft. “I miss the quiet at the end of a shift,” he said, his voice flat but firm. “And the work. It’s honest work. Nothing wrong with it.” The statement hung in the air, a small, grey truth in the midst of the colourful, artificial set. A flicker of panic crossed the male presenter’s eyes. This was not part of the script.

He recovered instantly, his professional smile snapping back into place. “Absolutely! And that fantastic work ethic is clearly serving you well! It’s that authenticity that the whole country has fallen in love with!” He pivoted seamlessly. “We’ve got thousands of messages coming in for you on social media, Alfie. Let’s take a look. Karen from Manchester says, ‘Alfie, your song makes my morning commute bearable!’ And Steve from Birmingham wants to know if you’ll be doing a tour soon!” The rest of the interview passed in a blur of softball questions and pre-vetted viewer comments. Alfie retreated into himself, giving short, non-committal answers, just trying to survive until the segment was over. The moment the show cut to a commercial break, the presenters’ smiles vanished. They were on their feet, unclipping their microphones, their attention already on the next item. Alfie was forgotten, a piece of furniture they no longer needed. A runner appeared and guided him wordlessly from the set, past the cameras and the lights, back into the grey reality of the backstage corridor.

He was halfway back to the hotel, cocooned once more in the silent black car, when his phone rang. The caller ID read ‘TCA Publicity’. He answered. A young, hyper-enthusiastic voice, a voice that sounded like it ran on a diet of espresso and ambition, chirped down the line. “Alfie! Great work this morning! The rawness, the vulnerability… the network is ecstatic. Socials are through the roof. Just one tiny note from us for the future. The chat on the sofa. When they ask about the chef stuff, we need to frame it as the fairy tale escape. The narrative is ‘from drudgery to dreamland’. Less of the ‘honest work’ angle. It’s a little… downbeat. We want people to feel inspired, not like they’re being lectured on the nobility of the service industry. Just something to bear in mind. Keep it positive, keep it aspirational! Talk soon!” The line went dead. Alfie stared out at the blur of traffic, the publicist’s words echoing in the silence. *Less of the ‘honest work’ angle*. The one moment he had tried to tell the truth, to defend the life he had known, had been flagged as a messaging error. It was a problem to be managed.

When he walked back into the hotel room, Gaz was pacing excitedly, holding his phone aloft like a trophy. “Mate! You were incredible! That performance… it was even better than last night! So quiet and sad. And you told him, didn’t you? That smarmy bloke in the jumper. ‘Honest work.’ You put him right in his place! I was cheering at the telly!” Gaz’s face was a picture of pure, unadulterated pride. He saw Alfie’s quiet defiance as a victory, a moment of unvarnished truth against the slick machine. He had no idea that the machine had already called, that the ‘error’ had been noted and a course correction issued. Alfie looked at his friend’s beaming face, then at the glittering trophy on the desk, then back at his own pale reflection in the darkened television screen. Gaz thought he had won. But Alfie was just beginning to understand the price of his success. In order to become the star everyone wanted him to be, he would have to systematically dismantle the person he actually was.Alfie didn’t have the heart to tell him. He couldn’t shatter Gaz’s pure, uncomplicated joy with the cold, clinical reality of the publicist’s phone call. To Gaz, he had landed a blow for the common man, a small victory for truth against the smarmy artifice of daytime television. To the machine, he had gone off-message, a minor software glitch that required a swift and immediate patch. So Alfie just nodded, forcing a smile that felt like a crack in a plaster mask. “Yeah,” he said, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. “Told him.” Gaz, oblivious, clapped him on the shoulder, his face alight with righteous pride. “That’s my boy,” he beamed. “Don’t let the bastards grind you down.” The irony of the phrase was so profound, so exquisitely painful, that Alfie almost laughed. The grinding had already begun; he could feel the grit of it in his very soul.

The next phase of the assault began that afternoon. He was taken not to a public studio, but to a small, windowless office on the fourth floor of the record label’s building, a room designated for “radio promotion.” It contained a table, a chair, a high-tech phone with a headset, and a laminated sheet of paper with a list of twenty radio stations from Aberdeen to Plymouth, each allocated a precise, ten-minute time slot. A young, fiercely ambitious woman named Tara, from the publicity department, handed him a bottle of water and a sheet of “key messaging points.” He saw the words ‘fairy tale’, ‘dream come true’, and ‘humble beginnings’ repeated in various combinations. “Just hit these notes,” she said with a bright, predatory smile. “They’ll ask the same three questions, you give them the same three answers. It’s easy. You’ll be great.”

The first few interviews were a disaster. The DJ from Radio Bristol, a man with a warm, fatherly voice, asked him what it was really like in a professional kitchen. Alfie, his guard down, found himself talking about the brutal heat, the camaraderie born of shared misery, the strange satisfaction of a perfectly executed service. He could almost feel Tara’s disapproval radiating through the wall from the adjacent office. The next interviewer, from Radio Newcastle, asked him what he’d say to other young people stuck in dead-end jobs. “I don’t know,” Alfie answered honestly. “I got lucky. It’s not like this happens to everyone.” After he hung up, Tara popped her head in, her smile strained. “Great energy, Alfie! Just remember, we want to be aspirational. ‘Follow your dreams, never give up!’ That kind of vibe.”

He got the message. By the time he was talking to Radio Manchester, a subtle but profound shift had occurred. When the DJ asked the inevitable question about his old job, Alfie heard a stranger’s voice come out of his own mouth. “It was tough, of course, but it taught me the value of hard work, and that’s something I’ll take with me on this incredible journey.” The words felt like smooth, tasteless pebbles in his mouth. He glanced at the key messaging points. ‘Incredible journey’. Check. He told the DJ from Radio Cornwall that winning was “a dream come true” and that he hoped his story would inspire others to “never stop believing.” He was no longer answering questions; he was reciting lines, performing the role of the grateful, humble winner. With each interview, a small piece of him eroded, washed away by the tide of corporate-approved platitudes. He was a ventriloquist’s dummy, and the voice was getting more convincing with every call.

Gaz, back in the hotel room, was initially ecstatic. He’d downloaded a radio app and was tuning in to each station like a proud parent tracking their child’s progress on sports day. He sent Alfie a stream of encouraging texts: ‘Smashing it on Mercia FM!’ and ‘Leeds loves you, mate!’ But by the time Alfie was talking to a station in the West Country, his fourteenth interview of the day, Gaz’s triumphant expression, had it been witnessed, would have slackened into one of confusion. The words were right, the story was the one they both knew, but the tune was wrong. It wasn’t Alfie, with his hesitant pauses and his blunt, Suffolk honesty. It was a pleasant, well-spoken stranger who had swallowed his friend and was now wearing his voice like a costume. The raw, unfiltered kid who had sung his heart out on the telly was gone, replaced by a media-trained automaton.

When Alfie finally walked back into the hotel room that evening, he felt like a hollowed-out gourd. The relentless performance had drained him of everything. Gaz was sitting in the armchair, the television off, the room unnervingly quiet. He didn’t jump up. He just watched Alfie drop his keycard on the desk and slump onto the edge of the bed. “Heard you,” Gaz said, his voice flat. It wasn’t an accusation, but it wasn’t a compliment either. Alfie rubbed his face, the muscles aching from hours of forced smiles he hadn’t even realised he was making. “Yeah? It was… a long day,” he mumbled. Gaz stood up and began to pace, a restless energy emanating from him. “What was that, Alfie? All that stuff about an ‘incredible journey’? You sounded like you were reading from a script. That’s not you. That’s not what you said on the telly the other morning.”

“It’s the job, Gaz,” Alfie snapped, the words coming out harsher than he intended, sharp with exhaustion and self-loathing. “It’s what they want me to say. It’s promotion. It’s part of the deal.” Gaz stopped pacing and stared at him, his face a mask of hurt bewilderment. “The deal? What deal? The deal was you sing, and people love it because you’re you! Not because you’re some… puppet saying what they tell you to! You fought Henderson for a ten-quid-a-week pay rise once! Where’s that bloke gone?” The question hung in the air, a devastatingly accurate grenade. Alfie had no answer. That bloke was gone, buried under a pile of press releases and key messaging points. He was a casualty of the incredible journey. The silence stretched between them, thick with everything they couldn't say, the room suddenly feeling too small to contain their two diverging worlds.The silence that followed Gaz’s question was more damning than any shouting match could ever have been. It filled the cavernous hotel room, seeped into the plush carpet and clung to the expensive, tasteless art on the walls. Alfie stood with his head bowed, not in shame, but in a profound, bone-deep weariness. He had no defence, because every word Gaz had spoken was the truth. The bloke who fought Henderson for a ten-pound pay rise, the stubborn, proud kid with fire in his belly, had been traded for a more marketable model. He was an obsolete version of himself. He finally lifted his head, his eyes feeling gritty and raw. “That bloke cleans grease traps for a living, Gaz,” he said, his voice a dead, toneless thing. He gestured vaguely at the opulent, impersonal room. “This one… this one has a number one single.” It wasn't an excuse; it was a simple, brutal statement of the transaction that had taken place.

Gaz stared at him, the righteous anger draining from his face to be replaced by something far worse: a deep, aching disappointment. He had been ready for a fight, for Alfie to push back, to defend himself with the same stubborn pride he had always possessed. But this hollowed-out resignation was a white flag, a surrender that Gaz couldn’t comprehend. He sank back into the armchair, the fight gone out of him, looking like a balloon that had been suddenly, silently deflated. The argument was over before it had even truly begun, fizzling out into a painful, unspoken truce. They were two friends sharing a room, separated by a chasm of experience that was growing wider by the hour. Gaz saw a sell-out; Alfie saw a survivor, and neither could understand the other’s perspective.

The next morning, the silence was a physical presence, a third person in the room. They moved around each other with a careful, clumsy politeness, the easy camaraderie they had shared their entire lives now a memory. Just as Gaz was zipping up his bag, preparing to make his escape into the city, an email pinged on Alfie’s phone. It was from Tara, the publicist. The subject line was: ‘Starlight – Music Video Treatment’. Alfie’s heart sank. With a sense of grim foreboding, he opened the attached document. It was a three-page description, full of effusive, corporate-creative language, detailing the visual narrative for his song. It described a young, handsome chef, toiling away in a “charmingly rustic, sun-dappled kitchen,” his brow furrowed with noble dreams as he gazed wistfully out of a sparkling-clean window at a CGI container ship gliding across a impossibly blue sea. It mentioned a “kindly but gruff boss” who would offer a paternal nod of encouragement. It was a sanitised, Hallmark-card version of his life. It was a lie. In a desperate, misguided attempt to bridge the gulf between them, he handed the phone to Gaz. “Look at this load of rubbish,” he muttered, hoping to find common ground in shared derision.

Gaz took the phone and began to read, his expression hardening with every sentence. The muscle in his jaw worked furiously. When he finished, he handed the phone back to Alfie as if it were contaminated. “A ‘charmingly rustic’ kitchen?” he spat, his voice thick with contempt. “The Salty Gull’s kitchen is a greasy, cramped, metal box that smells of bleach and despair. And a ‘kindly boss’? Henderson once threatened to dock your pay because you used too much lemon on the sea bass. They’re turning your life into a Disney film, Alfie.” The accusation was stark, but Alfie was too beaten down to feel its sting. “It’s what they do, Gaz,” he said, his voice a monotone. “It’s a music video. It’s not a documentary.” “It’s your life!” Gaz shot back, his voice rising. “Or it was. Now it’s just… content.” Seeing the dead look in Alfie’s eyes, Gaz’s anger faltered. In a last, desperate attempt to reconnect, Alfie said, “Come with me. To the shoot. Come and see what it’s like.” He didn’t know why he was asking. Perhaps he wanted a witness to his humiliation. Perhaps he just couldn’t bear the thought of facing it alone.

The shoot was on a vast, cavernous soundstage in an industrial estate in West London. As they walked through the huge hangar doors, Gaz stopped dead, his mouth falling open. Before them stood the lie, made manifest in wood, plaster, and clever lighting. The set of ‘The Salty Gull’ was beautiful. It was a designer’s fantasy of a working kitchen, with distressed wooden beams, gleaming copper pans hanging in perfect, artistic arrangements, and a basket of photogenic, vibrantly-coloured (and entirely plastic) vegetables sitting on a scrubbed pine table. The light pouring through the fake window was warm and golden, catching dust motes that had been puffed into the air by a smoke machine just moments before. Alfie felt a cold, hollow laugh bubble up inside him. This pristine, lovely space was an insult to the chaotic, grimy, authentic reality of the kitchen where he had bled, sweated, and first sung his song into the noisy extractor fan.

A young, impossibly energetic director with a ponytail and a headset barked instructions through a megaphone. “Okay, people, we want atmosphere! Let’s get the steam going! Alfie, darling, over by the stove! I want you to look at the pan, but I want you to be thinking about your dreams! Longing! Give me longing!” Alfie took his mark, feeling like a ghost haunting a pantomime of his own past. A portly, balding actor in a clean white apron was introduced to him as ‘Barry’, his on-screen boss. Barry beamed at him and gave his shoulder a hearty squeeze. “Just a thrill to be working with you, son,” he boomed. “Huge talent.” The artifice was so thick, so suffocating, that Alfie could barely breathe. He looked over to the shadows at the edge of the set and saw Gaz standing with his arms crossed, his face a thunderous mask of disbelief and disgust.

The playback of the perfectly produced single began to blast through the studio speakers, and Alfie started to lip-sync, his mouth forming words that his heart no longer felt connected to. He mimed chopping a plastic onion with a prop knife. He stared wistfully into the middle distance while a wind machine gently ruffled his hair. The director was ecstatic. “Yes! Gorgeous! The quiet desperation! The simmering ambition! The camera adores you, darling!” Alfie moved through the scenes in a dissociative fugue, a puppet whose strings were being pulled by the director, the label, the entire crushing weight of the machine. He was performing the most convincing role of his life: the role of Alfie Finch, the authentic, dreaming boy from the seaside. Every frame was a perfectly crafted lie, and he was the star accomplice. He felt Gaz’s eyes on him the entire time, not as a source of support, but as a silent, burning judgment.

The ride back to the hotel was a study in suffocating silence. The black car sliced through London’s evening traffic, but inside the vehicle, the air was thick and stagnant. Alfie stared out of his window, Gaz stared out of his, the grand architecture of the city a meaningless backdrop to the ugly, unspoken argument raging between them. The camaraderie that had been their bedrock for two decades had finally, irrevocably, fractured. Gaz’s presence, once a comforting anchor, was now a constant, painful reminder of the truth Alfie was being forced to betray. He was a walking embodiment of Alfie’s compromised integrity, and Alfie couldn’t bear to look at him.

They walked into the hotel room and the silence followed them, amplified by the sterile luxury of their cage. Gaz didn’t take off his coat. He just stood in the middle of the room, vibrating with a tightly coiled fury. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and shaking with rage. “That was the biggest, most insulting pile of steaming crap I have ever had to witness in my entire life,” he said, each word a carefully placed drop of acid. “A clean kitchen? A happy, smiling boss who looks like he’s about to start handing out Werther’s Originals? They’re building a theme park version of your life, Alfie, and you are its main attraction. And you just stood there. You smiled, you looked wistful, you let them do it. What the hell has happened to you?”

“What do you want from me, Gaz?” Alfie finally exploded, the day’s suppressed humiliation and self-hatred erupting in a torrent of defensive anger. He threw his hands up in a gesture of utter helplessness. “What am I supposed to do? Storm off the set? Tell the director his rustic kitchen isn’t gritty enough? Tell Julian Croft his hundred-thousand-pound video is a lie? They’ll drop me! They’ll sue me! It’ll all be over! This is the price! This is the job!” He was shouting now, his voice raw, his words echoing the grim reality he was only just beginning to accept.

Gaz stared at him, his anger suddenly draining away, replaced by a profound, heartbreaking sadness. “No, mate,” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. “The price isn’t the money. The price is you. And I can’t… I can’t stick around and watch you pay it anymore.” He turned and walked over to the corner where his scruffy holdall lay. He began to pack, throwing his few crumpled clothes into the bag with a grim, methodical finality. Alfie stood frozen, the blood draining from his face as the reality of what was happening crashed down on him. This wasn't a temporary argument. This was an ending. “Gaz… wait,” he managed to choke out, taking a step forward. “Don’t.”

Gaz zipped the bag and slung it over his shoulder. He walked to the door, pausing with his hand on the handle. He turned, and for a moment, Alfie saw the friend he had known his whole life, his face etched with a pain that mirrored his own. “I’m so proud of you, Alfie. I always, always will be. For what you did on that stage. But the bloke I’m proud of… the one who sang that song like his life depended on it… I don’t think he lives here anymore.” He pulled the door open. “Call me when you find him again.” And then he was gone. The heavy door clicked shut with a soft, final thud, leaving Alfie standing alone in the centre of the vast, silent room. He had won the whole world, and he had just lost the only part of it that had ever truly mattered.The click of the door was a sound of absolute finality, a small, sharp noise that severed the last thread connecting Alfie to the world he had known. He stood motionless in the centre of the silent hotel room, his ears ringing with the echo of Gaz’s final words. He didn't move for a long time, rooted to the plush carpet, staring at the impassive, polished wood of the door that had just swallowed his best friend. The vast, luxurious room, which had always felt impersonal, now felt actively hostile, its opulence a mocking counterpoint to the cavernous emptiness that had just opened up inside him. The silence was no longer peaceful or luxurious; it was a physical pressure, the weight of a vacuum where a lifetime of shared history used to be. He was utterly, terrifyingly alone.

His body finally unlocked, he walked slowly, aimlessly, around the room. He ran a hand over the cool, crisp duvet on Gaz’s side of the bed, the indentation from his friend’s head still faintly visible on the pillow. He saw the crumpled souvenir shop bag Gaz had left by the bin, the glittery red telephone box sitting incongruously on the bedside table next to a copy of a glossy, high-fashion magazine he hadn't noticed before. Each object was a small, painful testament to the life that had just vacated the premises. His gaze fell on the trophy, still sitting on the desk, its golden sheen catching the muted light. It wasn’t a symbol of triumph anymore; it was the murder weapon. He had a sudden, violent urge to hurl it against the wall, to watch it shatter into a thousand worthless pieces. But he didn't. The energy required for such an act of rebellion was gone, burned away by a day of relentless performance, leaving only a cold, heavy ash of despair. He sank onto the edge of his own untouched bed, the silence of the room a roaring in his ears.

The next morning, the five AM alarm was an obscene intrusion, a summons from a world that had no interest in his grief. He moved through the routine of showering and dressing in a grey, silent fog. There was no boisterous commentary from Gaz about the ridiculousness of his schedule, no clumsy words of encouragement, no one to guard the big shiny trophy. There was only silence. The black car was waiting, as always, a silent, punctual hearse. The driver, impassive as ever, didn't seem to notice or care that his passenger was now a party of one. The day was a blur of scheduled obligations, a forced march through the smiling, public-facing landscape of his new career. He did a photo shoot for a weekend newspaper magazine, standing in a series of borrowed, expensive clothes against a stark white background, his face a blank canvas onto which the photographer projected an idea of 'soulful introspection'. He gave the photographer exactly what he wanted: the hollow-eyed block of wood from the first day, the boy who wasn't there.

After the shoot, he was taken to the label’s headquarters for a "strategy meeting." He sat at one end of a long, polished table in a glass-walled conference room, flanked by Tara the publicist and a coterie of other young, ambitious people whose job titles he couldn't remember. At the far end, Julian Croft presided, cool and immaculate. They were ecstatic. The single was holding strong at number one, streaming numbers were unprecedented, and the social media engagement from his breakfast television appearance was “off the charts.” They showed him graphs and charts, brightly-coloured diagrams that illustrated his own success in a language he couldn’t understand. Tara beamed. "The 'sad performance' on breakfast TV was a masterstroke, Alfie. Accidental genius. It added a layer of depth, of pathos. The public is eating it up. We’re framing it as 'the lonely price of fame'. It tests incredibly well with the key demographic." Alfie stared at her, a cold dread creeping through him. His genuine misery, his quiet protest, had been absorbed by the machine, repackaged, and sold back to him as a successful marketing strategy. His pain was not a problem; it was an asset. Julian finally spoke, his voice cutting through the chatter. "We've seen the first cut of the music video," he said, his cool eyes fixed on Alfie. "It's perfect. Exactly the narrative we need. Aspirational, but with that touch of authentic, working-class grit." He gestured to a large screen on the wall. "Let's take a look."

The familiar piano intro filled the room, and the lie began. The beautiful, sun-dappled kitchen, the handsome, smiling actor playing his kindly boss, the artfully placed beads of sweat on Alfie’s own brow as he stared with deep, marketable longing at a CGI ship. It was worse than he remembered, a slick, sentimental fantasy that bore no resemblance to the truth. It was a commercial for a life he had never lived. He watched himself lip-syncing the words he had written in a moment of genuine desperation, his face a mask of counterfeit emotion. The team around the table murmured their approval. "Love the lighting." "That final shot is a killer." "He looks like a star." Alfie felt a wave of profound nausea. He was watching his own soul being expertly filleted, deboned, and served up on a platter of commercial lies. He wanted to scream. He wanted to smash the screen. But he just sat there, frozen in his chair, his hands clenched into tight fists under the table. When the video ended, the room was filled with enthusiastic applause. Julian Croft looked down the long table at him, a rare, thin smile on his lips. "Well done, Alfie," he said, the words dripping with a proprietary satisfaction. "You've given us exactly what we needed." The silence that followed was Alfie’s cue to express his gratitude, his awe, his delight. But his throat was closed, his voice trapped behind a wall of self-disgust. He could only nod, a single, jerky motion. His silence, once again, was taken as assent. The machine, having received its required input, moved on to the next item on the agenda: the international release strategy.The agenda moved on. A man whose title was something like 'Head of Global Synergy' began talking about the strategy for Germany. “The ‘singing chef’ narrative is less potent in the DACH region,” he said, pointing a laser at a pie chart. “We’ll be leaning more heavily on the ‘windswept, romantic North Sea poet’ angle. Very popular since Sting.” Alfie felt a wave of dizziness so profound he had to grip the edge of the table. They were carving him up, serving different pieces of his manufactured identity to different markets. He was no longer a person, but a portfolio of narratives to be deployed as needed. Tara then chimed in, her voice bright with excitement. “And we’ve had a very promising initial approach from the ‘Captain’s Table’ restaurant chain for a brand partnership. They love the synergy. Charming, rustic seafood, family values… it’s a perfect fit for the Alfie Finch brand.”

That was it. The final, crushing blow. A brand partnership with a chain restaurant that epitomised the very lie they had just constructed in the music video. A chain whose kitchens, he knew, were run on frozen, centrally-distributed produce, the absolute antithesis of everything Henderson had ever taught him. They weren't just selling his song; they were selling his integrity, his history, his boss’s entire philosophy, and they were selling it to the highest bidder to promote a plastic imitation. The quiet, simmering rage that had been building inside him for days didn't erupt. Instead, it solidified into a single, cold, clear thought. *No*. It was a word he hadn't said once since arriving in London. It was the word that had been beaten out of him in a relentless assault of praise, expectation, and professional courtesy. But now it was back, a small, hard stone of truth in the pit of his stomach.

Alfie stood up. The movement was slow, deliberate, and utterly silent, yet it had the effect of a gunshot in the hushed, air-conditioned room. Every head turned towards him. The Head of Global Synergy stopped mid-sentence, his laser pointer hovering over a meaningless bar graph. Julian Croft’s cool, appraising gaze narrowed. Alfie looked down the long, polished table at the faces staring back at him – eager, ambitious, predatory, and entirely uncomprehending. He didn’t feel anger anymore. He just felt an immense, pitying sadness for all of them, and for himself. "I'm sorry," he said, his voice quiet but steady, a sound that seemed to come from a great distance. "I can't do this." He didn't wait for a response. He didn't offer an explanation. He turned his back on the charts, the graphs, the brand partnerships, and the perfect, soul-destroying music video. He placed his phone, his digital leash, carefully on the polished surface of the table next to an untouched bottle of sparkling water, and walked towards the door.

He didn't run. He walked with a measured, even pace down the silent, carpeted corridor, past the framed gold discs celebrating other artists who had presumably made their peace with this Faustian pact. He could feel the shockwaves of his departure rippling behind him, the stunned silence that would now be erupting into frantic, confused activity. But he didn't look back. He pushed through the heavy glass doors of the main entrance and out onto the London street. The city hit him like a physical force: the roar of a passing bus, the sudden blare of a siren, the jostle of the indifferent lunchtime crowd, the complex, grubby smell of fumes and food and rain on hot pavement. It was chaotic, overwhelming, and utterly, beautifully real. For the first time in days, he felt like he could breathe. He was no longer Alfie Finch™, the asset. He was just Alfie, a bloke with no phone, no money, and no idea what he was doing, standing on a street corner in a city that didn't know or care who he was. And it was the most liberating feeling in the world.

He made his way through the sprawling, anonymous crowds to the Underground, his steps guided by a primal, homing instinct. He paid his fare with the last of the cash Henderson had given him, a crumpled twenty-pound note that felt like an artefact from another lifetime. The journey on the tube was a jarring, subterranean passage back to reality. He was surrounded by the tired, unsmiling faces of ordinary Londoners, people going to real jobs, living real lives, their faces illuminated by the glow of their own phones. He was invisible again, and the anonymity he had once found so terrifying now felt like a comforting blanket. At Liverpool Street Station, he found the platform for the trains to Norwich and Lowestoft. He bought a single ticket, the transaction cleaning out the last of his money, and stood on the platform, a fugitive from his own fame, waiting for the train that would take him back to the world he had so desperately wanted to escape.

The journey was a slow, unwinding of the soul. He sat by the window and watched as the dense, vertical chaos of London gave way to the sprawling, messy suburbs, which in turn dissolved into the flat, open, watercolour landscape of East Anglia. The endless green fields and vast, dramatic skies were a balm to his bruised spirit. The oppressive, glittering weight of the city lifted with every mile, replaced by a familiar, melancholy emptiness that felt like coming home. The light began to fade as the train rattled across the marshlands, the setting sun painting the clouds in shades of bruised purple and pale, watery gold. It was the same sky he had looked at his whole life, the sky that had inspired the song, and seeing it again felt like finding a piece of himself he thought he had lost forever. He hadn’t realised how much he had missed the sheer, empty expanse of it all.

When the train finally shuddered to a halt at Lowestoft station, it was full dark. He stepped out onto the familiar, windswept platform and the air hit him. It was the smell of home: cold, sharp, and salty, with an undertone of diesel from the harbour and the distant, greasy promise of vinegar from a late-night chippy. The town was quiet, buttoned up for the night. He walked through the deserted streets, his footsteps echoing in the silence. The garish lights of the bookmaker’s shop below his old flat were flashing their pathetic, rhythmic strobes into the empty street. He looked up at the darkened window of his flat, a place that held no comfort for him now, and kept walking, drawn by an invisible thread towards the harbour, towards the sea.

He didn’t stop until he found himself in the narrow, cobbled alley behind The Salty Gull. The night was cold, and a damp chill radiated from the old brick walls. A single, bare bulb above the back door cast a sickly yellow light onto the glistening, wet ground. He could hear the faint, rhythmic clatter of pans from inside, the muffled sound of the dishwasher, the low murmur of voices. They were cleaning down. He stood in the shadows, his hands shoved deep in his pockets, and breathed in the familiar, sacred smells: old cooking oil, industrial cleaner, and the bins, ripe with the ghosts of a thousand filleted fish. A figure emerged from the kitchen, a young kitchen porter Alfie barely knew, dragging a heavy black bin bag towards the overflowing skips. He didn't see Alfie standing in the darkness. He was just a kid at the end of a long shift, doing an honest, thankless job. Alfie watched him go back inside, the door swinging shut, and felt a wave of longing so profound it almost brought him to his knees. He had escaped. He was free. And he had never been more of an outsider in his own life. He was home, and he had absolutely nowhere to go.
