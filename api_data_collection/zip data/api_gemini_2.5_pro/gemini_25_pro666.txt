The pigeons on the Stortorvet square spoke a dialect of complaint and avarice that Linnea understood as intimately as her own mother tongue. It was a guttural, cooing pidgin of dropped crusts, territorial squabbles, and the eternal, weary vigilance against the sudden shadow of a child’s stomping foot. She sat on the cold lip of the fountain, the bronze fist of Christian IV pointing eternally towards some forgotten mandate, and felt the city’s thrum not in her ears, but in the fine bones of her ankles. It was a low, ceaseless vibration, the aggregate hum of ten thousand refrigerators, the underground pulse of the T-bane, the collective sigh of a million quiet anxieties. For most, it was background noise. For Linnea, it was a language, and it was telling her, as it had been for the last seventy-three years, that she did not belong.

She wasn’t supposed to be here. Her kind were meant for the deep woods, the places where the sunlight fell in dappled coins through leaves the size of dinner plates, where the air tasted of damp earth and wild garlic. They were stories whispered to children, warnings about straying too far from the path. A Huldra, with a hollow back and a cow’s tail hidden by magic and clever tailoring, had no business driving the number 12 tram from Majorstuen to Kjelsås, a rhythmic, lurching pilgrimage through the very heart of the human hive. Yet, that was her life. Her glamour, woven from morning mist and the iridescence of a raven’s feather, held firm, showing the world a woman in her late twenties with hair the colour of autumn birch leaves and eyes that held the grey-green of a fjord on an overcast day. It was a good glamour, strong, passed down through a maternal line that had long since retreated into the forests of Nordmarka, disgusted with the encroaching stink of asphalt and progress.

Linnea, however, had been born of a dalliance, a moment of weakness between her Huldra mother and a human surveyor who had been charmed not by magic, but by a shared love for cloudberries and the poetry of Olav H. Hauge. The result was Linnea, a creature of two worlds, at home in neither. Her tail was a mere stump, a knot of cartilage at the base of her spine that ached when the barometric pressure dropped. Her hollow back was just a slight, unnatural concavity, easily mistaken for poor posture. She was a diluted thing. The forest felt too quiet, the silence too loud with the rustle of things she only half-remembered. The city, this city, was a cacophony that drowned out the emptiness, but it offered no solace. Every fare she collected, every automated announcement of the next stop, was a grain of sand polishing her down, smoothing away the wild magic until she felt as featureless as a sea-worn stone.

The decision had not come like a lightning strike. It had grown like a lichen on a damp wall, slow, patient, and inexorable. It had started with the silence. She’d ducked into the Oslo Domkirke one afternoon to escape a sudden downpour, the tourists scattering like startled starlings. The air inside was cool and thick, smelling of old stone, beeswax, and something else, something vast and quiet. It wasn't the dead silence of the deep forest, which was always listening. This was a weighted silence, a silence with purpose. It was the negative space around a million whispered prayers. In that moment, surrounded by the stoic gaze of stained-glass saints, she felt a pang of envy so sharp it was almost a physical pain. They had structure. They had rules. They had a beginning, a middle, and an end, all wrapped in the profound certainty of faith. Her own existence was a long, unspooling thread of moments, with no discernible pattern, no ultimate purpose beyond simply *enduring*.

She pulled her phone from the pocket of her worn jacket, the screen a stark blue against the grey afternoon. She scrolled to Aksel’s name. Her step-brother. Her mother, after the surveyor had wandered back to his own life, had tried to make a go of it in the human world for Linnea’s sake. She’d married a kind, gentle man, a widower with a young son. For a few years, they had been a strange, patchwork family. Then the call of the wild became too strong, and her mother had vanished back into the trees, leaving behind a heartbroken husband and two confused children. Aksel was the only one who knew. The only one who had seen her tail twitch in her sleep as a child, who had helped her explain away the strange wilting of a bully’s prize-winning roses. He was studying to be a veterinarian now, a man of science and scalpels, yet he accepted her nature with the same pragmatism he applied to a dog with a broken leg.

He answered on the second ring. "Linnea? Everything okay? You're not calling to tell me you've made the trams run on pine sap again, are you?"

A small smile touched her lips. "No, nothing so ambitious. Are you busy?"

"Drowning in canine anatomy. A pop quiz on the brachial plexus. Why?" He sounded tired, but his voice was a warm, solid anchor in the swirling grey of her thoughts.

She took a breath, the air tasting of diesel fumes and roasted almonds from a nearby cart. "I'm going to do it, Aksel. I'm going to join the convent."

The silence on the other end was different from the church’s silence. This one was filled with the frantic whir of a scientific mind trying to compute an impossible variable. "The... the convent? Like, with the penguins? No, that’s not right. Nuns. You mean you’re going to become a nun?"

"The Carmelite sisters. Up on the hill. I've spoken to the Mother Superior. Reverend Mother Agnes."

"You’ve— When did you do that?"

"Last week. And the week before. We’ve been talking."

"About what? The finer points of transubstantiation versus, I don't know, glamour maintenance?" His attempt at a joke was brittle with disbelief. "Linnea. Be serious. You're a Huldra. Well, Huldra-ish. They're... Catholic. It's like a cat deciding to become a fish. The environment is fundamentally hostile to your entire system."

"Maybe I want a hostile environment," she whispered, watching a young couple kiss near the fountain, their joy a bright, painful spark. "Maybe I'm tired of my own system. It isn’t working, Aksel. I just... drift. The years just pass. You're building a life, a career. You'll get old. You'll have a story. My story is just 'and then she kept on being'. I want... I want discipline. I want vows. I want walls that hold me in and a faith that holds me up."

He sighed, a long, weary sound that travelled through the phone and seemed to push the city’s hum back for a moment. "They won't understand. If they ever find out what you are... It could be dangerous, Lin. They used to burn your kind."

"They used to burn women for reading," she countered, a flicker of her mother’s wild defiance sparking in her chest. "Times change. Besides, she doesn’t know. Reverend Mother Agnes. She just sees a young woman searching for God. And maybe she's right. Maybe that’s all I am."

"And your… biology?" he asked, the vet in him surfacing. "The tail? The… other stuff? The not-aging thing?"

"The tail is a memory. The 'other stuff' is quiet these days. And the not-aging..." she trailed off. That was the great, terrifying secret. Fair folk didn't age like humans. They weathered, like mountains, over millennia. A few decades in a city was nothing. "I'll look thirty for a very long time. They'll just think I have good genes."

"Linnea..."

"Don't try to stop me," she said, her voice firmer now. The decision felt solid, a stone in the pit of her stomach. "I need this. I need to try. My whole life has been about hiding what I am. Maybe it’s time I tried to become something else."

She hung up before he could argue further, her thumb hovering over the screen. She looked from the phone, a portal to the frantic, complex human world, to the stone spires of the cathedral, pointing like fingers to a silent, orderly heaven. She was tired of the noise. She was tired of the pigeons and their petty grievances, of the hum of electricity in her bones, of the long, slow, meaningless march of days. She stood up, her joints cracking softly. She straightened her jacket and, without a backward glance at the bustling square, began to walk towards the hills, towards the high stone walls of the Carmelite convent where a different kind of silence was waiting.The climb was steep, a penitent’s path winding away from the neat, prosperous houses of the lower slopes. With every step, the city’s hum lessened, replaced by the rustle of wind in the firs and the distant, lonely cry of a crow. The air grew thinner, cleaner, losing the greasy tang of exhaust and taking on the scent of pine needles and cold stone. Linnea walked with the steady, ground-eating pace of someone who had spent a lifetime moving, never arriving. She passed a final, isolated house with a child’s bicycle left on the lawn, a splash of primary-coloured plastic that seemed impossibly vibrant, a relic from a world she was already leaving behind. Below her, Oslo was a bowl of glittering lights, the T-bane a glowing serpent slithering through its depths. For the first time, seeing it from a distance, she felt not alienation, but a strange, sad pity for its frantic, temporary energy.

The convent walls were grey stone, patched with moss and lichen that glowed a virulent green in the fading light. They were not menacing, merely definite. They marked a boundary, a line drawn between one state of being and another. A simple, black-painted iron gate was set into the stone, and beside it, a brass bell pull, worn smooth by the hands of supplicants and deliverymen. Linnea hesitated for only a heartbeat, then pulled. The bell’s sound was not loud, but clear and resonant, a single, pure note that cut through the evening air and seemed to vibrate in her teeth. After a moment, a small wooden hatch in the gate slid open, and a pair of eyes, old and startlingly blue, peered out. A voice, reedy but kind, asked her name. When she gave it, the hatch slid shut, and she heard the scrape of a heavy bolt being drawn. The heavy oak door closed behind her with a sound like a book shutting on a long chapter, and the world fell away.

Reverend Mother Agnes was waiting for her in the cloister, a covered walkway surrounding a small, meticulously tended garden. She was a woman carved from seasoned oak, her face a roadmap of fine lines etched not by anxiety but by decades of focused contemplation. Her eyes, the colour of dark honey, held a stillness that was unnerving. It was not a vacant stillness, but a powerful, occupied one, and as she looked at Linnea, it felt less like an assessment and more like a simple acknowledgement of a fact that had long been settled. There were no questions about why she was there, no probing for last-minute doubts. Her arrival was expected, an answered prayer. She led Linnea through silent, echoing corridors, their footsteps the only sound, past walls of whitewashed plaster adorned with nothing but the occasional dark, wooden crucifix. The air smelled of beeswax, lemon oil, and something else, the clean, slightly metallic scent of cold, concentrated faith.

Her new room, her cell, was at the end of a long hallway on the second floor. It was not a room, but an idea of a room, stripped to its most essential form. A narrow bed with a thin mattress and a coarse woollen blanket, a small wooden desk, a straight-backed chair, and a single window that looked out not on the city, but back towards the forest of Nordmarka. A plain, grey dress and a simple veil were laid out on the bed. This was the uniform of a postulant. There was no ceremony to it, just a quiet, practical exchange. Linnea stripped off her own clothes—the worn jeans, the soft, faded sweater, the boots scuffed with the grime of a thousand city streets—and folded them into a neat pile. She took her phone from her pocket and turned it off, the screen going black like a closing eye. This, more than anything, felt like a severance. Into a simple canvas bag went the phone, her wallet, the keys to her empty apartment, and the small, dog-eared book of Hauge’s poetry. Reverend Mother Agnes took the bag without a word and left, closing the door softly behind her, leaving Linnea alone in the encroaching silence and the stark new geometry of her life.

Later, lying on the hard mattress, she could feel the change in the very marrow of her bones. The city’s vibration was gone, a phantom limb that still tingled with a memory of noise. This new silence was absolute. It pressed in on her, a physical weight on her eardrums. Outside her window, the forest she had forsaken was a mass of impenetrable darkness under a sliver of moon. For a terrifying moment, the instincts of her mother’s blood surged within her. The urge to run, to tear down the door and flee into the wild, familiar dark was a physical nausea. Her hollow back ached with a dull, insistent throb, and the knot of cartilage at the base of her spine felt hot and tight, a forgotten muscle tensing for a tail that wasn’t there. She curled into a ball, pressing her forehead against the cold wall, and focused on her breathing, just as the Reverend Mother had instructed. In, out. A rhythm. A rule. It was the first brick in the new wall she was building around herself, and she held onto it as if it were the only solid thing in a dissolving world.The bell came before the dawn, not a gentle summons but a brutal clang of forged iron that shattered the profound silence and yanked Linnea from a shallow, restless sleep. In the deep woods, she would have woken with the gradual lightening of the sky, with the first tentative chirp of a finch. Here, time was not a tide but a hammer blow, portioning out the day with metallic precision. For a disoriented moment, she didn’t know where she was. The darkness was absolute, the air cold and thin. Then she felt the rough weave of the blanket, the unforgiving hardness of the mattress, and it all came rushing back. She was not Linnea, the tram driver. She was a postulant. She was an experiment. With clumsy, cold-stiffened fingers, she dressed in the unfamiliar grey serge, the fabric scratching against skin that was accustomed to the soft wear of cotton and denim. The cold stone floor seeped through the thin soles of her slippers as she joined the silent procession of dark-robed figures moving towards the chapel.

They moved as one body, a slow, dark river flowing through the veins of the convent. In the chapel, the only light came from a constellation of candles on the altar, their small flames dancing and casting long, wavering shadows. The air was thick with the scent of snuffed candles and frankincense, a holy smell that felt clean and ancient. As the first notes of the Lauds chant began, a plainsong in Latin, Linnea felt the sound in her bones. It was a low, resonant frequency that vibrated differently from the city’s hum. This was not a noise of aggregation, but of intention. It was harmony. She didn't understand the words, but she felt their shape, the architecture of them. She watched the other sisters, their faces pale and serene in the candlelight, their eyes closed or fixed on the crucifix hanging in the darkness above the altar. She tried to mimic their placid obedience, to still the frantic, wild thing in her chest that wanted to claw at the stone walls. The collective faith in the room was a tangible force, a gentle but immense pressure, like being at the bottom of a very deep, very calm sea.

Her days fell into a rhythm dictated by the bell: prayer, silent breakfast, work, prayer, lunch, work, prayer, vespers, supper, compline, and then the great, waiting silence of the night. Her work was in the gardens. It was a cosmic joke she could appreciate with a certain grim irony. She, a creature whose mother could coax ancient oaks into changing their direction of growth, was now on her knees in the damp soil, her knuckles raw, waging a quiet war on clover and dandelions in the meticulously ordered vegetable patches. She learned the brutal satisfaction of uprooting a thistle, the quiet meditation of weeding a row of carrots. She was assigned to the rose garden under the tutelage of Sister Elin, a woman well into her eighties with hands as gnarled as ginger root and a pragmatic, earthy faith. Sister Elin moved slowly but with an unshakeable purpose, her secateurs snipping with decisive clicks as she deadheaded the spent blooms.

"Rain's coming," Sister Elin said one afternoon, her voice a dry rustle. She squinted at the bruised purple clouds gathering over the forest. "I feel it in my knuckles." Linnea felt it too, but not in her knuckles. She felt it as a drop in atmospheric pressure that made the hollow of her back ache with a familiar, phantom pain and sent a low thrum through the rudimentary knot of her tail. It was the same ache she’d felt on the Stortorvet square just days before, but here, in the quiet of the garden, it felt less like a symptom of her alienation and more like a simple, private truth. "Yes," Linnea agreed, her voice quiet. "It will be here soon." Sister Elin gave her a brief, approving nod, mistaking her certainty for a farmer’s wisdom rather than a creature’s instinct. In that small, shared moment, Linnea felt a flicker of something she hadn't expected: a sense of belonging, however mistaken its premise. She was hiding in plain sight, but for the first time, the hiding felt less like a deception and more like a translation. She was learning to speak the language of this place, a dialect of bowed heads, calloused hands, and a silence that was not empty, but full of listening.Weeks bled into a month, and the sharp edges of Linnea’s old life began to blur. The city became a half-remembered dream of noise and exhaust fumes. Her body, a traitor to her own memory, was adapting. Calluses bloomed on her palms, tough and yellow, a cartographer’s map of her labours with spade and hoe. She learned the precise angle at which to hold her back when kneeling on the cold chapel stones to avoid the worst of the ache. Her movements, once fluid with the unthinking grace of a wild creature, became more deliberate, broken down into the discrete, efficient motions of the community. She was learning the choreography of holiness, the silent dance of work and prayer. She could genuflect with the correct posture, make the sign of the cross without thinking, and hold her hands in the proper attitude of prayer. But it was a performance, a glamour far more complex and demanding than the one she had woven from mist and raven feathers. That had been a simple shield to hide what she was. This was an elaborate construction, an attempt to build a new person from the outside in, and she was beginning to fear there was nothing inside to hold the shape.

The most profound point of her disconnect came during Mass, in the consuming reverence for the Eucharist. She would kneel between Sister Elin and the perpetually smiling Sister Therese, and watch the priest elevate the Host. A small silver bell would ring, a sound that pierced the hushed devotion, and the sisters around her would bow their heads, their souls apparently soaring. Linnea would bow her head too, but her soul remained stubbornly earthbound. To her, a creature of blood and soil, whose very essence was tied to the tangible life-force of the world, the concept was incomprehensible. Her mother’s people drew power from running water, from the sap in a living tree, from the heat of a stag’s breath on a winter morning. They did not consume their gods; they lived in concert with them. When the wafer, thin and papery, was placed on her tongue, she felt no divine presence, no mystical transformation. It tasted of flour and ritual. The wine was just wine, thin and sour on her palate. Each time, she felt a fresh wave of failure, a cold certainty that she was a counterfeit coin in a treasury of true gold. She was a hollow thing in a different way now, empty of the faith that animated everyone around her.

Reverend Mother Agnes had an unnerving habit of appearing just when Linnea’s thoughts were at their most mutinous. She found her one evening in the scriptorium, where Linnea was tasked with repairing the bindings of old hymnals. The room smelled of decaying paper, leather, and glue. The Reverend Mother did not speak at first, merely watched Linnea’s long, slender fingers working a needle and waxed thread through the tough spine of a book. “You have a gift for mending things, Sister Linnea,” she said at last, her voice as smooth as the polished wood of the pews. “Your hands are patient.”

Linnea’s heart gave a guilty lurch. “I am just following the method Sister Maria taught me.”

“Still,” the Reverend Mother continued, her gaze steady. “There is a grace in your work. But mending a book is not the same as mending a soul. The silence of this place… for some, it is a balm. For others, it is a mirror. It shows us what we are without the world’s distractions. Tell me, what does the silence show you?” The question was gentle, but it landed with the force of an accusation. Linnea’s mind raced. The truth was impossible: *It shows me that I am a creature of the forest trapped in a stone box, that my blood sings to the moon and not to your God, that I am a lie from the soles of my feet to the crown of my head.* But she had learned the language of this place, the currency of pious humility. “It shows me how far I still have to go, Reverend Mother,” she whispered, not meeting the old nun’s eyes. “It shows me the poverty of my own spirit.” It was a perfect answer, and she hated herself for its perfection. Reverend Mother Agnes was silent for a long moment, then placed a cool hand on Linnea’s shoulder. “Good. To know your own poverty is the beginning of wealth.”

The touch, meant as a comfort, felt like a brand. After Compline, the final prayer of the day, Linnea lay in her cell, the Reverend Mother’s words echoing in the vast silence. She felt like a spy who had successfully passed an interrogation but was now more isolated than ever. The lie she had told felt like a stone in her throat. She rose from her bed and went to the window, pressing her forehead against the cold glass. The forest was out there, a vast, living entity breathing in the dark. A night owl hooted, a deep, resonant call that vibrated through the window and straight into her bones, a note of wild, untamed truth in a world of structured piety. It was a language she understood without translation, a question and a summons. *Who are you? Where do you belong?* The walls of her cell, which she had sought out as a refuge, suddenly felt thin and brittle, not a fortress but a cage. The disciplined quiet she had craved was no longer a peaceful void but a vacuum, and it was threatening to pull her apart.The owl’s call became a recurring punctuation mark in the long, silent sentences of her nights. It was a sound that belonged to the world she had renounced, and it threaded its way through the stone walls and the scent of beeswax to find her. Autumn arrived, not as a gentle decline, but as a hostile takeover. The wind, which had been a placid sigh in summer, now carried a sharp, predatory edge, tearing the gold and crimson leaves from the trees in the forest and flinging them against the convent’s high windows like handfuls of desperate confetti. For the other sisters, it was a time of poignant beauty, a reminder of mortality and the comforting cycle of the liturgical year. They spoke of the crisp air as a blessing, a clarification of the senses. For Linnea, it was torture. The air was thick with the smells of decay and damp earth, a rich, intoxicating perfume that spoke directly to her Huldra blood. It was the scent of home, and breathing it in the confines of her cell felt like a fresh bereavement with every inhalation.

Her work in the garden became her primary battlefield. The earth was alive, humming with a frantic energy as it prepared for the long sleep of winter. When she plunged her hands into the soil, she could feel the network of roots, the slow, secret life of worms and beetles, the deep, patient pulse of the world. It was a power she was supposed to be ignoring, a song she was meant to be deaf to. Sister Elin, her back now bent almost double against the season, would instruct her to clear the last of the summer vegetables, to turn the soil, to cover the precious rose bushes in burlap against the coming frost. Each act of pruning, of tidying, of imposing order on the land felt like a small act of violence against her own soul. She found herself fighting the urge to whisper to the struggling herbs, to coax a final, defiant bloom from a frost-bitten dahlia, to let the wild, creeping thyme run rampant and reclaim the neat stone pathways.

The focal point of the garden’s autumn ritual was the propagation of the ‘Rosa Sancta’, a thornless, white-blossomed rose bush that, according to convent legend, was descended from a cutting brought from the Holy Land during the first crusades. Its continued survival was seen as a small, living miracle, a testament to their enduring faith. Linnea had been tasked with tending the new cuttings, small, vulnerable sticks of wood housed in a cold frame. One afternoon, while the other sisters were at vespers, a weak sliver of sun broke through the grey clouds, illuminating the cold frame with a pale, ethereal light. Linnea was kneeling beside it, her mind adrift. The scent of rain-soaked leaves was particularly strong, and it carried a sharp, sudden memory of her mother, laughing, her hair caught with birch leaves as she danced in a sun-dappled clearing. A wave of loneliness so profound it felt like drowning washed over her. Without thinking, her fingers brushed against the soil of one of the pots, a silent, desperate plea for connection, for a sign of life in the suffocating quiet.

It was not a conscious act of magic. It was a sigh from her soul that bled into her fingertips. Under her touch, the small, dormant stick of the rose cutting shivered. She felt it, a faint vibration that travelled up her arm. Her eyes snapped open. Before them, a tiny, pale green shoot was pushing its way out of the bark, unfurling with an unnatural, time-lapsed speed. A leaf, perfectly formed and dewed with moisture, opened itself to the weak sunlight. Linnea snatched her hand back as if she’d touched a hot coal, a strangled gasp caught in her throat. She stared, horrified, at the miraculous, monstrous little leaf. It was a flag, a declaration of her true nature, sprouting from the very heart of their most sacred tradition. It was life, wild and insuppressible, and in this place, it was a heresy more profound than any doubt.

Panic, cold and sharp, seized her. She scrambled to her feet, her gaze darting around the empty garden. The bell for the end of vespers would ring any moment. The sisters would be coming for their evening meal. Someone, Sister Elin or the Reverend Mother, would check on the cuttings. They would see. The word ‘witch’ was a distant, historical echo, but in the face of this impossible growth, what other word would they have? Her first instinct was to run, to scale the wall and disappear into the welcoming gloom of the forest. But a new, strange instinct held her fast: the discipline of the convent. You do not run. You solve the problem. With a trembling hand, she reached for the small, sharp pair of secateurs hanging from a hook on the cold frame. The steel was cold against her palm. It felt like a betrayal of her mother, of the wild green magic that was her only real inheritance. With a single, brutal snip, she severed the new shoot at its base. The perfect little leaf fell onto the soil. She scooped it up, along with the tiny stem, and clutching the damning evidence in her fist, she hurried to the compost heap behind the garden shed. She dug a hole deep within the rotting vegetable matter, buried the evidence of her sin, and covered it over, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird.## Chapter 2

She scrubbed her hands at the stone basin outside the kitchen, the coarse lye soap biting into the raw skin of her knuckles. The acrid smell of decay from the compost heap seemed to have permeated her very being, a phantom scent of her own sacrilege. The bell had rung for supper, and she joined the silent stream of sisters, her movements stiff, her face a carefully blank mask. Inside the refectory, the long wooden tables were set with simple earthenware bowls and spoons. The scraping of chairs, the quiet clatter of cutlery on stoneware, sounds she had come to find soothing in their predictability, now seemed deafeningly loud, each one a potential exposure. She kept her eyes fixed on the bowl of barley soup in front of her, the steam rising in a wavering column. She could feel the gaze of Reverend Mother Agnes from the head of the room, not a direct stare, but a weighty awareness that seemed to press on the back of her neck. The lie she had constructed, the persona of the seeking postulant, had been a simple garment. Now it was a suit of ill-fitting armour, and the secret it concealed was a living, pulsing thing, hot and shameful against her skin.

That night, sleep was a foreign country she could not enter. The silence of her cell, once a vast, open space for contemplation, had shrunk to the tight dimensions of a coffin. Every creak of the old building, every gust of wind against the glass, was a footstep coming to demand an accounting. She replayed the moment in the garden over and over: the surge of illicit life, the glint of the secateurs, the soft thud of the severed leaf on the soil. It was an act of profound self-mutilation, a desperate attempt to cut away the part of her that did not, and could not, belong. She had come here for walls, for rules, for a faith to hold her up. But the first true test had come not from God, but from the earth, and she had failed it by succeeding, proving herself to be exactly what she was trying to escape. She was a cuckoo in a nest of doves, and the single, vibrant green leaf had been her alien song. She pressed her face into the thin, lumpy pillow, a dry sob caught in her throat. The wild magic, her only true inheritance from her mother, felt not like a gift, but like a congenital disease, one that would always betray her.

The next morning, she went to the garden with a sense of grim inevitability, like a criminal returning to the scene of the crime. The air was cold and damp, the sky the colour of wet slate. She busied herself with turning over a spent patch of earth, her shovel striking the soil with a punishing rhythm. She tried to lose herself in the ache of her muscles, in the simple, mindless work. But her eyes kept straying towards the cold frame, a place she now regarded with a mixture of terror and shame. Sister Elin was already there, her frail form bent over the precious cuttings, her movements slow and deliberate. Linnea’s heart began to beat a frantic, uneven rhythm against her ribs. She kept her head down, her world shrinking to the clods of dark earth at her feet, praying to a God she didn’t believe in that the old nun would see nothing amiss.

"Sister Linnea," Sister Elin’s voice was as dry as a pressed leaf, but it cut through the morning air and found Linnea with unerring accuracy. Linnea froze, her shovel halfway into the earth. "Come here, child." It was not a request. Slowly, she put down the shovel and walked towards the cold frame, each step feeling as though her boots were filled with lead. Sister Elin did not look up. She was pointing a gnarled, soil-caked finger at the very cutting Linnea had touched. "Look here," she commanded. Linnea forced her eyes downwards. She saw the tiny, almost invisible wound on the stem where she had made the cut. It was a minuscule scar, a secret only she could read. "A touch of canker," Sister Elin declared, her voice filled with a gardener’s quiet disappointment. "It happens. The damp gets in. We will lose this one, I think. A pity." She reached for her own small, well-oiled secateurs. With a decisive snip, she cut the entire stick of wood an inch from the soil. "There. No sense letting it spread." She tossed the cutting, the source of Linnea’s panic and self-betrayal, onto a discard pile. "We must have faith in the ones that remain," she said, more to herself than to Linnea, and moved on to the next pot. Linnea stood motionless, the wave of relief so powerful it made her dizzy. The evidence was gone. Her monstrous miracle had been diagnosed as a mundane disease and discarded. She was safe. But as she watched Sister Elin’s patient, faithful work, the relief curdled into a cold, heavy guilt. Her lie was not only intact, it was thriving, protected by the very innocence and faith of those she was deceiving.## Chapter 3

The lie, once confessed and discarded by Sister Elin, did not vanish. Instead, it took root in the fertile soil of Linnea’s guilt and grew, a dark and thorny vine coiling around her heart. She was a phantom at the convent’s feast, her outward form performing the familiar rituals of prayer and work while her inner self starved. The simple routines she had craved now felt like the bars of a meticulously crafted cage. Each genuflection was a fresh act of perjury; each note of plainsong she uttered was a counterfeit currency she used to purchase her continued, fraudulent existence among these women of genuine faith. Her sin was not that she had doubts – she saw doubt flickering in the eyes of younger sisters from time to time – but that her very biology was a fundamental contradiction to the world she inhabited. She was a creature of the deep woods masquerading as a seeker of the Holy Spirit, and the deception was poisoning the silence she had once sought as a balm.

The first snow came in the deep of a November night, a silent invasion that transformed the world. Linnea awoke to a pre-dawn stillness more profound than any she had yet experienced. The bell’s clang was muffled, swallowed by the thick white blanket that lay upon the rooftops and the dormant garden. Looking from her window, she saw not the familiar dark mass of Nordmarka, but a world scrubbed clean of detail, reduced to a pristine, abstract landscape of white and grey. For the other sisters, it was a cause for quiet joy, a visible manifestation of purity and grace. As they walked to the chapel, their black robes stark against the snow, their breath pluming in the frigid air, they murmured about the beauty, the peace, the sign of God’s hand. For Linnea, the snow was a heavy shroud, pressing down on the sleeping life of the earth. The cold was no longer a crisp, invigorating presence; it was a predator, seeping through the stone walls, through the wool of her habit, and sinking deep into her bones. The ache in her back, a dull memory for weeks, reignited into a low, constant fire, and the knot of her tail felt like a stone of ice lodged at the base of her spine. It was a deep, biological command to slow, to cease, to go to ground. A Huldra did not flourish in the dead of winter; she endured.

A letter from Aksel arrived, passed to her by Sister Maria at the end of the midday meal. It was a single, folded sheet of paper in a plain envelope, but it felt as foreign and contraband as a lit cigarette. She took it to the cold, empty scriptorium to read, her fingers fumbling with the seal. His handwriting was a chaotic, intelligent scrawl, a stark contrast to the perfect calligraphy she had been studying. He wrote of gross anatomy labs, of the frustrating intricacies of a feline nervous system, of the first-year student who fainted during a necropsy. He wrote of their father, who missed her and sent his love, and of the changing city, of a new coffee shop where her old tram stop used to be. *“Are you warm enough?”* he asked. *“I imagine it’s all stone floors and drafts. Remember to eat your greens. You can’t live on prayer and communion wafers alone. Though knowing you, you’re probably trying.”* The casual, scientific concern was a physical blow. He was worried about her iron levels. She was fighting a war with her own mythology. She folded the letter, the paper already feeling like a relic from another lifetime, and felt a chasm open between the woman who was a vet’s sister and the creature kneeling in a freezing chapel, pretending to see God in a piece of bread.

The instinct to hibernate grew stronger, a gravitational pull on her very cells. Her movements, once deliberately paced to match the sisters, became genuinely sluggish. It took a monumental effort to rise from her bed in the morning, to lift the heavy fork to her mouth, to push the shovel into the frozen earth of the garden, now hard as iron. A persistent pallor settled on her skin, and dark, bluish shadows bloomed beneath her fjord-grey eyes. Sister Elin, mistaking the symptoms for a common winter malady, pressed warm, bitter infusions of yarrow and elderflower into her hands. Sister Therese, her brow furrowed with genuine concern, promised to offer a rosary for her health and fortitude. Their kindness was an exquisite form of torture, each gentle gesture a reminder of how utterly they misunderstood the nature of her suffering. They were offering remedies for a human body and a human soul, while the ancient, non-human part of her was simply trying to sleep through the world’s death.

Reverend Mother Agnes summoned her not with a quiet word in a corridor, but with a formal message delivered by a novice. She found the abbess in her office, a room made warm only by a small, hissing radiator and the sheer force of the woman’s presence. The snow-light from the single window was flat and unforgiving, leaving no softness on the Reverend Mother’s carved-oak features. "You are fading, Sister Linnea," she said, her voice devoid of accusation but heavy with observation. She did not gesture for Linnea to sit. "You came to us seeking structure, a wall against the world. But a wall also casts a shadow. Some souls find rest in that shadow. Others... others find it a place to hide. And the things we hide from God have a way of consuming us from within." She paused, her dark honey eyes fixed on Linnea’s face. "The body is a vessel for the spirit. When the spirit is in conflict, the vessel often cracks. Tell me, is your vessel cracking from the rigours of this life, or from a battle you refuse to name?"

Linnea stood before her, a pillar of cold. The truth was a wild bird trapped in her throat, beating its wings against her ribs. *My vessel is cracking because it was not made for this climate. My spirit is not in conflict, it is in hibernation. I am a seed in the permafrost, and you are asking me to bloom.* But the well-practiced words of the postulant came instead, a reflex of her profound deception. "The fault is my own, Reverend Mother. My faith is weak. I am unworthy of the grace you all show me." The lie was thin and brittle, and for the first time, she saw a flicker of something in the Reverend Mother's eyes – not belief, but a deep, sorrowful patience, as if watching a child persist in a foolish, damaging game. "Unworthiness is not a fault," she said softly. "It is the ground upon which grace is built. But you must be honest about the foundation. Go. Pray for a spirit of truth."

Linnea fled, her duty done, the interview a failure. That night was Christmas Eve. The Vigil Mass was the pinnacle of the convent's year, a long, beautiful, and arduous journey of chant and prayer through the coldest, darkest hours. The chapel was arctic, the stone floor leaching warmth from the soles of her feet, from her knees, from her very soul. The air, thick with incense and the pure, soaring notes of the choir, felt heavy, hard to breathe. Linnea knelt between the solid, unmoving forms of the other sisters, a statue of ice. The Latin, a language she had begun to find a strange comfort in, blurred into a meaningless drone. The candlelight swam before her eyes. The scent of pine boughs decorating the altar mingled with the incense, and for a moment, it was not the scent of Christmas, but the raw, wild scent of the forest. The owl’s hoot, the rustle of a predator in the undergrowth, the deep thrum of the sleeping earth—it all surged in her mind, a cacophony of her true home. The world narrowed to a pinprick of light. The chant receded, replaced by a rushing sound, like wind through pines. She felt a gentle nudge from Sister Elin, a silent query. But Linnea could not respond. The thread holding her upright had snapped. With no sound, no dramatic fall, she simply folded, her body surrendering to the cold and the dark, a soft collapse of grey wool onto the unforgiving stone.She did not feel the hard impact of the stone. Her collapse was a slow, spiraling descent into a velvet darkness, a surrender she had been fighting for months. The world dissolved into a smear of candlelight and a receding tide of Latin chant. She was vaguely aware of movement, of firm, surprisingly strong hands lifting her. She felt the sudden shock of cold air outside the chapel, then the muffled quiet of the long corridors. There were voices, hushed and concerned, but they were the sounds of a distant shore. Her consciousness was adrift on a dark, internal sea, pulling her down towards a place of profound stillness, a place that felt less like oblivion and more like a homecoming. In the depths of this state, there were no prayers, no guilt, no cold stone floors, only the deep, slow, dreamless sleep of a forest buried under a winter’s worth of snow.

She awoke in the infirmary, a small, whitewashed room that smelled of dried herbs and rubbing alcohol. A thin bar of weak winter sunlight fell across the foot of her cot. She was tucked under a mountain of heavy wool blankets, and a pleasant, radiating warmth emanated from a clay bottle placed by her feet. For a long moment, she simply lay there, feeling a profound absence of pain. The gnawing ache in her back was gone, the icy tension at the base of her spine had melted away. Her body felt boneless and peaceful, as if it had finally been allowed to do what it had been begging to do for months: stop. Sister Elin sat in a chair by the cot, her gnarled hands busy mending a torn altar cloth, her needle moving with the slow, steady rhythm of a heartbeat. She looked up, her face a web of concerned wrinkles. "Ah. You are with us again. You gave us all a fright, child."

Her voice was a dry rustle, but it was gentle. She put down her sewing and shuffled over to feel Linnea's forehead with a hand that felt like cool, dry paper. "The fever has broken. It is a deep exhaustion of the spirit that took you. We see it sometimes. The first winter is the hardest. The soul must acclimatize to the silence, just as the body must acclimatize to the cold." She poured a cup of pale, steaming liquid from a thermos. "Drink this. Willow bark and meadowsweet. It will ease what remains of the ache." Linnea sipped the bitter tea, the warmth spreading through her chest. Sister Elin’s diagnosis was so kind, so logical, and so completely wrong. It wasn’t the silence that had broken her; it was the noise of her own nature screaming against it. She felt a surge of affection for the old woman, a painful gratitude for a compassion she did not deserve.

Later that afternoon, after Sister Elin had departed for Vespers, the door opened to admit Reverend Mother Agnes. She moved without a sound, a dark figure against the pale light, her presence immediately changing the quiet sickroom into a place of judgment. She did not bother with pleasantries or questions about Linnea's health. She simply stood by the bed, her stillness a powerful force, and looked at Linnea with an unnerving, diagnostic clarity. "Sister Elin believes you are suffering from a crisis of faith brought on by physical exhaustion," she began, her voice low and even. "She believes more prayer, rest, and herbal teas will restore you. She is a good and simple soul. I, however, do not believe your problem is a lack of faith." She paused, her eyes seeming to penetrate the layers of blankets, flesh, and bone to the secret heart of Linnea. "I believe your problem is that you are trying to serve two masters. And one of them is not God."

The words struck Linnea with the force of a physical blow. The careful facade she had maintained, the lie of the humble postulant, crumbled to dust under that calm, certain gaze. The air in the room grew thick, and Linnea’s breath caught in her chest. This was it. This was the moment of exposure. All her carefully rehearsed lines of pious self-deprecation felt absurd and useless. The truth, or some version of it, was the only thing left. Her heart hammered, not with fear of expulsion, but with the terrifying prospect of being, for the first time, truly seen. She swallowed, her throat dry and raw. "I... I don't know what you mean, Reverend Mother." The denial was weak, a pathetic reflex.

"Do you not?" Reverend Mother Agnes pulled the straight-backed chair closer to the cot and sat, her posture as unyielding as the wood. "I have watched you, Sister Linnea. I have watched you in the garden. You do not simply work the earth; you listen to it. I have watched you in the chapel. You do not fight distraction; you fight a different kind of prayer that rises from you unbidden. And I watched you last night. You did not faint from weakness. You surrendered to something. Something the cold and the dark called forth. It is an old power. I do not know its name, but it is wild, and it is of the earth, and it is not of Christ." She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "You did not come here to find God. You came here to build a cage for the god you already serve. Am I wrong?" The question was not an accusation; it was an invitation. Linnea looked into the abbess’s eyes and saw not a judge, but a soul-physician, waiting for the patient to finally name her disease. The dam of her long deception broke. A single tear, hot and sharp, escaped and traced a path down her temple. "No," she whispered, the single word a confession, a surrender, a plea. "You are not wrong."## Chapter 4

The confession, a single, whispered word, hung in the cold, antiseptic air of the infirmary. It did not shatter the silence but was absorbed by it, changing its quality from one of placid stillness to one of profound, waiting tension. Linnea felt stripped bare, as though the Reverend Mother’s gaze had peeled back not just her woolen habit, but her skin, her ribs, and the glamour of humanity she had worn for a lifetime. She lay under the weight of the blankets, her body strangely peaceful after its long-sought surrender, but her mind was a maelstrom of terror and relief. The game was over. The lie had been called. She waited for the judgment, for the quiet, sorrowful pronouncement of her expulsion from this place that had become her whole world.

Reverend Mother Agnes did not recoil. She did not make the sign of the cross or murmur a prayer against evil. Instead, a deep, contemplative quiet settled over her features, as if Linnea’s admission were not a shocking heresy but a complex theological problem she was now required to solve. She looked from Linnea’s pale face to the weak winter light at the window, then back again. When she spoke, her voice was as calm and measured as it had been during their discussions on the writings of Saint Teresa of Ávila. “A gardener,” she said softly, “does not curse the wildness of the soil. She does not pour salt on it to make it barren. She learns its nature. She learns what it wants to grow, what stones must be cleared, what nutrients it lacks. Only then can she plant a garden that will bring glory to God.” She folded her hands in her lap, her knuckles white. “Tell me about this other god. The one you have been trying to starve.”

The question was so direct, so devoid of fear, that it disarmed Linnea completely. She had expected an exorcism, but this felt more like a clinical consultation. The truth, which she had guarded for seventy-three years, felt heavy and misshapen on her tongue. She struggled to find the words, the human vocabulary for a non-human reality. “It is not a god,” she began, her voice a reedy whisper. “It has no name. It is… the world. The life in the dirt. The feeling of rain before it falls. It is my mother’s blood in me.” She took a shuddering breath, the story tumbling out in broken fragments. “My mother was… of the forest. She could sing water from a dry stream bed and her moods could sour the milk. She belonged to the deep woods, and she left me because I did not. I am a diluted thing, Reverend Mother. Too human for the wild, and too wild for the human world. The… power, as you call it, is not something I wield. It is something I am. In the city, the noise of humanity drowned it out. I came here for the silence, thinking it would suffocate what was left of it. But I was wrong. The silence is like clean soil. And it is growing in me again.”

Reverend Mother Agnes listened with an unnerving, absolute stillness. She did not interrupt. She did not show shock, or pity, or disgust. She listened as a confessor listens, weighing the words not for their literal truth, but for the state of the soul that spoke them. When Linnea fell silent, exhausted by the effort of her testimony, the abbess was quiet for a long time, her gaze distant. “In the old texts,” she said at last, her voice thoughtful, “the Desert Fathers wrote of the demons they faced in the wilderness. They were not all monsters of temptation and vice. Some were demons of place, ancient spirits tied to the rocks and the sand and the lonely wind. The Fathers did not always fight them. Sometimes, they baptized them.” She looked directly at Linnea, her eyes boring into her. “They learned their names and commanded them to serve God.”

A frisson of cold that had nothing to do with the winter air traced its way down Linnea’s spine. This was a theology far older and stranger than the gentle pieties of the younger sisters. This was a faith forged in conflict with a world that was still filled with pagan magic, a faith with iron in its bones. “I cannot baptize the forest, Reverend Mother,” Linnea whispered, horrified and fascinated. “I cannot command the tide or the turning of the seasons to praise your God.”

“No,” Agnes agreed, a flicker of something almost like a smile touching her lips. “But you can. You are the crossroads, child. The place where these two worlds meet. Your mistake was in believing you had to choose one and destroy the other. That is a work of pride. The work of faith is one of integration, of consecration. To take what you are—all of what you are—and offer it to God.” She stood, her dark robes falling around her. The interview was coming to an end. “You will remain in the infirmary until the Christmastide feasts are over. You will rest. You will eat what Sister Elin brings you. You will not fight the sleep your body craves. That is your first penance: to cease your war against yourself. When you are stronger, we will find a new kind of work for you. A new kind of prayer. Not one of denial, but of offering. We will see if this wild god in your blood can learn to kneel.”The silence Reverend Mother Agnes left behind was entirely different from the one Linnea had known before. It was not the weighted, watchful silence of the chapel, nor the empty, clinical silence of the city. This was a silence of detonation, the ringing quiet after a blast has leveled a familiar landscape. Linnea lay motionless, the abbess’s words echoing in the new wasteland of her understanding: *A work of integration. We will see if this wild god in your blood can learn to kneel.* The proposition was so audacious, so contrary to the neat, dualistic world she had constructed out of fear, that her mind struggled to grasp its shape. She had come to a place of stark binaries—God or nature, spirit or flesh, silence or noise—only to be told that the path to salvation lay not in choosing a side, but in becoming the bridge between them.

The days of Christmastide passed in a dreamlike state. From her infirmary cot, she heard the life of the convent as if from a great distance: the rich, resonant swell of carols from the chapel, the faint clatter of crockery from the refectory during festive meals, the muffled laughter of the novices engaged in some rare moment of recreation. None of it touched her. She was in a cocoon of her own, obedient for the first time not to a rule that chafed, but to one that soothed. She slept, not the shallow, restless sleep of her first weeks, but a deep, profound hibernation that felt like sinking into the rich, dark soil of her own being. She ate the simple, nourishing broths Sister Elin brought, accepting them not with guilt, but with a quiet gratitude. The perpetual, grinding ache in her bones eased, the cold receded from its siege of her marrow, and she felt her own vital energy, which she had fought for so long, slowly, cautiously uncoil within her. She was not warring with the winter; she was part of it.

When the twelve days of Christmas had passed and the ordinary, austere rhythm of the convent resumed, Reverend Mother Agnes returned. The winter light was sharp and blue, and it cast the abbess’s face into stern, apostolic relief. She carried no herbal tea, offered no comforting platitudes. She was a general outlining a new campaign. “Your penance of rest is complete,” she stated, her voice leaving no room for argument. “Your new work begins. It is the same as your old work: the garden. But your purpose is changed. You are no longer there to tame it, to prune it into submission. You are there to be its steward in a deeper sense. Your prayer for now will not be the Liturgy of the Hours. It will be the liturgy of the earth.” She leaned forward, her intensity a palpable force. “When you feel the frost coming, your prayer will be for the sleeping roots. When you feel the thirst of the soil, your prayer will be for the gift of rain. You will take the wild, untamed language of your blood, and you will learn to translate it into the language of praise. Go to the greenhouse. Start there. Listen. And then, offer what you hear back to the God who created both the rose and the thorn, the saint and the soil.”

The greenhouse was a small, glass-paned structure leaning against the south-facing wall of the cloister, a fragile bubble of managed life against the iron-hard winter. The air inside was humid and cool, smelling of damp earth, terracotta, and the faint, green scent of dormant geraniums. It felt like a sacred space now, and a profoundly dangerous one. This was where her old life had shattered. Linnea ran a hand along the cold, damp glass, her breath misting in front of her. Her new instructions were a paradox: to use the very sense she had tried to dull, to engage with the power she had tried to kill. It felt like being told to walk a tightrope over a chasm, with no promise of a net. She knelt on the damp stone floor before a bench of overwintering herbs. Rosemary, thyme, sage, their leaves drooped, their colour muted, their energy a low, dormant hum. She reached out, hesitating, then laid her palm flat on the soil of a pot of rosemary.

For months, this simple act would have been a prelude to a battle of wills. She would have felt the thrum of life and immediately recoiled, shoring up her internal walls, silencing the response in her own blood. Now, she did as she was told. She did not recoil. She listened. She let the sensation flow into her, a cool, sluggish current of information. She felt the plant’s deep thirst, the tightness of its roots in the cold-compacted soil, the slow, patient waiting for the sun. It was a language of pure being, without words or sentiment, a psalm of endurance. The wild part of her, the Huldra, understood it instantly. The human part, the postulant, struggled with the next step. *Translate it.* How? She closed her eyes, her hand still resting on the pot. She did not try to form the elegant, formal words of the chapel. She formed a simple, desperate thought, directing it outwards, upwards. *It is thirsty,* she prayed, the words clumsy in her mind. *Creator of the hidden spring and the summer rain, see the thirst of this, your creation. Grant it the strength to endure until the light returns.* As she formed the thought, she allowed a flicker of her own warmth, a tiny, controlled pulse of the life-force she had so long suppressed, to flow down her arm and into the soil. It was not a command. It was a petition, an offering, a gift of her own essence to amplify the prayer. It was the most honest prayer she had ever made.A profound quiet followed her prayer. There was no flash of green light, no sudden, miraculous blooming. Instead, there was a subtle shift in the energy of the plant beneath her hand, a change as quiet and intimate as a sleeper’s sigh of relief. The low, thrumming hum of its dormant life seemed to steady, to deepen, as if it had drawn a long, slow drink. She felt the faintest of tremors, a vibration of gratitude that traveled up her arm and settled in her chest not as a shock, but as a quiet resonance. For the first time, an act born of her wild blood did not leave her with a residue of shame and fear. The energy she had offered had not diminished her; it had completed a circuit. In that small, humid pocket of the world, she felt a fragile sense of wholeness, as if two warring parts of her had, for a single, astonishing moment, agreed to a truce.

Her life found a new, strange rhythm, divorced from the communal clockwork of the convent. While the other sisters gathered in the scriptorium or the laundry, their hours marked by bells and prescribed duties, Linnea’s hours were measured by the slow breathing of the earth. She became an anchorite in a cell made of glass and dormant life. The greenhouse was her domain, a laboratory for Reverend Mother Agnes’s radical experiment in faith. Each morning, after the briefest attendance at Lauds, she would go to her post, the cold, damp air a familiar greeting. She moved from pot to pot, from seed tray to dormant vine, laying her hands upon them as a physician would a patient. She would close her eyes and listen, not with her ears, but with the ancient, cellular empathy of her kind. She felt the slow, sweetening of the sap in the dormant fig, the anxious dream of the tomato seeds, the deep, stony patience of the rose cuttings. And for each, she would translate its state of being into a prayer, a raw, artless petition offered up to a God she was only just beginning to understand as the architect of this deep, silent language.

Sister Elin would visit her, her small, bent form moving slowly among the benches. She did not ask what Linnea was doing. She saw only the results. “The geraniums have never held their colour so well through a January,” she would comment, her voice a dry rustle of approval. “And this begonia… I thought we had lost it to the damp, but look at it. The leaves have firmed up.” She peered at Linnea, her aged eyes bright with a simple, pragmatic curiosity. “You have the gift, child. A true gardener’s hand.” Linnea, her hands stained with rich, dark soil, would simply nod, a wave of warmth and guilt washing through her. “I just try to listen to what they need, Sister,” she would reply, and the statement was so profoundly true that it felt like no lie at all. Her success, misinterpreted as a simple green thumb, became a quiet shield, allowing her to continue her strange ministry in plain sight, her heresy disguised as a blessing.

As the winter wore on, the war within her subsided into a guarded peace. The deep, gnawing ache in her back did not vanish, but it changed its nature. It was no longer a symptom of alienation, a constant reminder of her ill-fitting form. It became a tool, a sensitive barometer that told her of shifts in pressure, of the moisture content in the air, of the slow, subterranean turning of the world towards spring. The wild god in her blood, the creature of deep woods and primal instinct, was no longer a prisoner being starved in a dungeon. It was more like a wild hawk, hooded and tethered to her wrist, its savage nature still intact but now bound to her will, learning to serve a new purpose. She was still a creature of two worlds, but she was no longer being torn apart by them. She was becoming the ground where they met, a hybrid creature of startling, unknown potential. The shame of being a ‘diluted thing’ was slowly, painstakingly, being replaced by the dawning, terrifying possibility that she was something new altogether.

Spring arrived not as a gentle guest but in a series of violent skirmishes with the retreating winter. Days of brilliant, warm sun that coaxed the pale, tender shoots from the ground were ambushed by nights of bitter, scouring frost. The garden became a battlefield of emerging life and lingering death. Linnea felt the shift with every fibre of her being. The quickening pulse of the earth was a frantic, joyful rhythm in her own blood. One afternoon in late April, as she was inspecting the ‘Rosa Sancta’ bushes by the cloister wall, a familiar pressure began to build at the base of her spine. It was a cold, sharp, and specific ache. She looked up at the sky, which was a clear, brilliant, and deceptive blue. There was no sign, no cloud, no shift in the wind that a human would notice. But the Huldra in her knew. A killing frost was coming. A plunge of arctic air, a final, spiteful assault from winter. She looked at the rose bushes, the pride of the convent, their stems covered in the delicate, wine-red nubs of new growth, some already unfurling into miniature, vulnerable leaves. They were utterly exposed. By morning, they would be a blackened, mushy ruin. A wave of panic, cold as the coming night, washed over her. This was not a single, thirsty plant in the safety of the greenhouse. This was the heart of the garden, the living symbol of the convent's history, and it was about to die.## Chapter 5

The knowledge of the coming frost was not a thought; it was a physical certainty, a sudden, violent clamping of ice around her heart. One moment, she was admiring the fragile courage of the new rose leaves in the gentle afternoon light; the next, she was a creature of the wild scenting the approach of a wolf. The sky above was a placid, cloudless expanse of deepening blue, offering no hint of the atmospheric betrayal to come. The air was still and cool, but not yet sharp. To any other soul in the convent, it was a perfect, peaceful spring evening. To Linnea, it was the deceptive calm before an execution. Her gaze swept over the rows of the ‘Rosa Sancta’, each tiny, unfurling leaf a point of exquisite vulnerability. Generations of sisters had tended these bushes. Their survival was a testament, a living rosary counting the decades of faith. To let them die now, on her watch, under her strange new stewardship, would be a failure more profound than any she had yet experienced.

For a wild, panicked moment, her mother’s instincts screamed at her to flee, to abandon the foolish, fragile human world and melt back into the woods where survival was the only sacrament. But the discipline of the past months held her fast. The voice of Reverend Mother Agnes, cool and insistent, cut through the terror. *The work of faith is one of integration.* She would not run. She straightened her back, the ache already a sharp, insistent signal, and turned from the garden. She did not run, but her swift, purposeful stride was a near-run, her soft-soled shoes making no sound on the stone cloister walk. She had to find the Reverend Mother. The experiment was over; this was the test.

She found her in the chapel, not praying in a pew, but standing before the high altar, overseeing Sister Maria’s replacement of the tall beeswax candles. The air was cool and smelled of wax and old stone. Linnea stopped at the edge of the sanctuary, her heart hammering. "Reverend Mother," she said, her voice tight and breathless. The two sisters turned. Sister Maria’s face registered mild surprise at the interruption. Reverend Mother Agnes’s expression did not change, but her eyes narrowed, instantly perceiving the crisis radiating from Linnea. She gave a small, dismissive nod to Sister Maria, who quietly retreated. "What is it, Sister Linnea?" the abbess asked, her voice low. "The roses," Linnea managed, her breath coming in short, sharp bursts. "There is a frost coming. A hard one. Tonight. The sky is lying, but the earth is not. It will kill the new growth. It will kill all of it."

Reverend Mother Agnes’s gaze was sharp, analytical. She looked past Linnea, through the open chapel doors towards the serene evening sky, then back at Linnea’s pale, earnest face. For a human, it was a prediction of madness. For the woman who had commanded Linnea to baptize her own wildness, it was raw, actionable intelligence from a foreign but trusted scout. There was no hesitation. “The work bell,” she said, her voice crisp and authoritative. “Ring it. Three times. All sisters to the garden. We will cover them.” She was already moving, her dark habit flowing behind her, a general launching a surprise counter-offensive. Linnea, stunned by the swift, unquestioning belief, hurried to the thick rope by the main gate. The heavy bell, normally used to call the lay workers, sent a series of deep, urgent tolls across the peaceful convent grounds, a brazen alarm that shattered the evening’s holy calm.

Within minutes, the garden was filled with the dark, fluttering shapes of the sisters, their faces a mixture of confusion and obedient concern. Reverend Mother Agnes directed them with quiet, efficient commands. Burlap sacking was brought from the garden sheds, the same covers that had been put away only weeks before. A quiet, frantic urgency settled over the community as they moved through the fading light, draping and tying the rough fabric over the precious bushes. Linnea worked alongside them, her hands clumsy with haste, her senses screaming at the plummeting temperature. The sun had dipped below the wall, and the air grew teeth. A new, sharper wind snaked through the cloister, carrying a chill that felt ancient and predatory. She could feel the life in the plants beginning to contract, a silent, terrified retreat of sap from the vulnerable leaves. The burlap felt pitifully thin, a pauper’s blanket against an arctic king.

By the time the last bush was covered, the bells for Compline were ringing, calling them to the final prayer of the day. The garden was dark, the air now painfully cold. Reverend Mother Agnes surveyed the rows of shrouded, lumpy forms. She dismissed the sisters, her voice calm and reassuring, urging them towards the warmth of the chapel. But as Linnea turned to follow, the abbess laid a light hand on her arm, holding her back. The old woman’s gaze was fixed on the garden. "It is not enough, is it?" she asked softly. It was not a question. It was a statement of shared, grim knowledge. Linnea shook her head, unable to speak, the knot of her tail a shard of ice. "Do what you must," the Reverend Mother whispered, her voice barely audible over the wind. "God gave you your gifts. It is no sin to use them in the service of His creation." She then released Linnea’s arm and turned, walking away towards the chapel without a backward glance, leaving Linnea alone in the battlefield of the dying light.

The world had narrowed to the garden, the wind, and the devouring cold. Linnea stood motionless as the last of the sisters vanished, the chapel door closing with a distant, gentle thud. The moon, a cold, sterile crescent, rose above the forest, casting a silver, surgical light on the scene. Already, a fine, glittering lacework of frost was beginning to form on the surface of the burlap, a declaration of winter’s victory. The mundane solution had failed. She walked slowly to the centre of the garden, to the oldest and largest of the rose bushes, the mother plant from which all the others had been propagated. Its shrouded form looked like a hunched, praying figure. She reached out and stripped back the burlap, exposing the gnarled, ancient wood and the delicate, trembling new leaves to the killing air.

She placed her palms flat against the main stem. The wood was brutally cold, its life-force a faint, terrified flicker deep within. She closed her eyes, shutting out the sight of the glittering frost, and reached deep inside herself. She bypassed the fear, the doubt, the careful, measured discipline she had been practicing. She went to the source, to the wild, untamed reservoir of her mother’s blood, the deep, warm wellspring of life that hummed at the core of her being. She did not command it. She did not even ask. She simply opened a door she had kept barred and chained her entire life and let it flood outwards. It was not a prayer of words, but a raw, inarticulate offering of self. *Live.* The warmth poured from her, a torrent of vital energy flowing from her hands into the cold wood of the rose. It was a sun rising in the heart of the plant, spreading through the main stem, out into the branches, a tide of impossible heat pushing back against the frost. The air around the bush shimmered, a faint, visible aurora of warmth. A soft sound, like the cracking of ice, came not from the air, but from deep within her own spine as the cold she was displacing rushed in to fill the void. The world tilted, the moonlight blurring at the edges. She held on, her hands fused to the wood, pouring her own summer into the plant’s winter, until she could feel its life-force steady, a strong, stable pulse returning under her palms. Only then did she let go, her offering complete. The cost was immediate and catastrophic. A tremor wracked her body, a violent ague of deep, internal cold. The garden spun around her. She stumbled back, pulling the burlap back over the bush with the last of her strength. Her life for its life. It was a fair trade. With the last dregs of her consciousness, she turned and staggered away from the garden, a ghost of herself moving through the freezing dark, leaving behind a small, impossible pocket of spring, purchased at a terrible price.She did not make it to her cell. She barely cleared the cloister walk, her body moving on a final, ragged nerve of instinct that screamed for shelter. The moonlight seemed to leech the remaining colour from the world, rendering the ancient stones in stark shades of silver and black. The cold inside her was no longer an ache but a hollowing, a silent implosion of her vital core. It was the cold of a starless void, the absolute zero of a soul that has spent its last reserves of warmth. Her legs gave way not with a sudden buckle, but with a slow, boneless folding, as if the threads of her physical being had simply dissolved. She crumpled against the base of a stone pillar, a heap of dark wool in the freezing shadows, her last conscious sensation the rough, unforgiving texture of the ancient stone against her cheek.

Reverend Mother Agnes had not gone to Compline. After leaving Linnea in the garden, she had retreated only as far as the shadowed archway of the chapel door, a silent, solitary sentinel. She understood the nature of the power she had sanctioned; she understood that such gifts were rarely, if ever, without a profound and terrible cost. She had sent the child to fight a dragon, and she could not, in good conscience, turn her back and pray while the battle was waged. She listened, not to the distant chant from within the chapel, but to the deeper silence of the garden. She felt the subtle shift in the air, a strange displacement of energy that was not of the frost, a pulse of impossible warmth that lasted only a moment and then vanished. It was then that she knew. She stepped out from the archway just in time to see Linnea’s frail, staggering form emerge from the garden, a ghost lit by the cruel moonlight, and then collapse into the shadows of the cloister.

Moving with a swiftness that belied her age, the abbess crossed the open space. She knelt beside Linnea’s still form, her own knees protesting against the frozen stone. She reached out and placed a hand on Linnea’s neck, searching for a pulse. She found one, but it was a faint, thready flutter, as fragile as a moth’s wing. It was the cold that shocked her. It was not the simple chill of the night air clinging to skin and cloth. It was a deep, penetrating, unnatural cold that seemed to emanate from the very marrow of Linnea’s bones, a grave-chill that spoke of a life force utterly and catastrophically depleted. This was the cost. She saw it now, in the blue tinge of Linnea’s lips, in the absolute stillness of her form. The miracle of the roses had been paid for in full, a direct transfusion of life from one vessel to another. Bowing her head for a moment, Reverend Mother Agnes made a silent, grim prayer not of petition, but of responsibility. She had pushed this soul to the precipice, and now she would not let it fall into the abyss.

With a strength born of sheer will, she gathered Linnea into her arms. The girl was terrifyingly light, as if the substance of her had been hollowed out. Grunting with the effort, the old woman hoisted her up and began the slow, arduous journey back towards the infirmary. Each step was a penance. The corridors were silent and dark, the rest of the community safely enclosed in their cells or the chapel. The secret remained hers alone. In the infirmary, she laid Linnea on the cot and began to work with a desperate, methodical haste. She piled every blanket she could find onto the still form. She rekindled the small stove until it glowed a dull red, heating stones to wrap in cloth and place around Linnea’s icy feet and torso. This was a battle against a cold that soapstone and wool could not truly touch, but it was the only worldly medicine she possessed. As she worked, she looked at the pale, still face on the pillow, a face as serene and remote as a marble effigy, and understood the terrifying scope of her gamble. She had asked a wild thing to kneel, and instead, it had offered itself up as a living sacrifice upon an altar of its own making.

The morning broke, clear and cold and devastatingly beautiful. The world was sheathed in a thick, crystalline armour of frost. Every blade of grass, every twig, every stone was a work of intricate, ephemeral art. As the sisters emerged for Lauds, a collective gasp went through them. The vegetable patches, the herb gardens, any plant left exposed was a blackened, slimy ruin, the cellular structure of its leaves burst by the ice. A sorrowful silence fell over them. But then Sister Elin, her face grim, led a small party to the rose garden to assess the expected carnage. As they pulled back the first burlap cover, a cry of pure, unadulterated shock rang out. There, nestled in the morning light, the new leaves of the ‘Rosa Sancta’ were not blackened, but were instead a vibrant, healthy green, each one adorned with a perfect, glistening droplet of dew, not frost. They moved from bush to bush, uncovering the same impossible reality. The garden around them was a testament to the frost’s deadly power, but their sacred roses, their living history, were utterly unharmed. It was impossible. It was a miracle. Within minutes, the entire community was gathered in the garden, their faces upturned, murmuring prayers of thanks, their voices thick with awe. They saw it as a sign, a direct blessing from God, a reward for their faith. Only Reverend Mother Agnes, standing slightly apart from the joyful crowd, knew the truth. Her gaze drifted from the vibrant, living roses to the distant, quiet window of the infirmary, where the true price of this miracle lay as still and as cold as the stone on a winter tomb.## Chapter 6

The miracle in the garden became the new, beating heart of the convent. In the refectory, the sisters spoke of it in hushed, reverent tones, their words weaving a tapestry of divine intervention. They recounted the details with the loving precision of apostles: the perfect, unharmed green of the leaves, the glittering dew that was not frost, the stark contrast with the blackened ruin of the less sacred plants. For Sister Elin, it was the vindication of a lifetime of simple, steadfast faith. Her gnarled hands, which had tended the roses for over sixty years, now trembled when she touched their leaves, as if she were touching the hem of a holy garment. The ‘Rosa Sancta’ were no longer just a living tradition; they were a relic, a tangible sign that God was intimately present and pleased with their quiet lives of devotion. But while the convent was swept up in a tide of joyous awe, Reverend Mother Agnes was stranded on a desolate shore, alone with the true cost of their miracle. In the cold, quiet infirmary, she kept a lonely vigil, watching the source of their divine sign lie as still and as silent as the stone she had collapsed upon.

Days bled into a week, and Linnea’s state did not change. It was not a coma, not a sleep, but a profound and terrifying stasis. Her body was not fighting an illness; it seemed to have simply stopped, suspended in a state of absolute depletion. The unnatural cold persisted, a deep, intrinsic chill that no number of heated stones or woollen blankets could touch. It was the cold of an empty vessel, a lamp whose oil had been completely consumed. Reverend Mother Agnes would sit by the cot for hours, her own prayers a stark contrast to the joyful praise rising from the chapel. Her petitions were grim, desperate arguments waged in the dark. *Did I misunderstand You?* she would demand of the silence. *I asked her to offer her gift, not to be consumed by it. Is this a consecration, or an annihilation?* The miraculous roses in the garden felt less like a blessing and more like a cruel taunt, a beautiful bloom fed by a life she had sworn to protect. The weight of her secret, and her complicity, was a physical burden, pressing down on her shoulders, aging her more in a week than the past decade had.

The atmosphere in the convent grew thick with piety. The sisters moved with a renewed sense of purpose, their faces serene, their faith bolstered by irrefutable proof. They offered novenas for the recovery of their new postulant, Sister Linnea, who had been struck down by a sudden, severe fever on the very night of the miracle. They saw a sacred poetry in it: while grace had descended upon their garden, their newest member was locked in a spiritual battle, her illness a sign of her sensitivity to the holy event. Their compassion and their prayers, directed at the pale, still girl in the infirmary, were a constant, painful reminder to Agnes of the beautiful, brittle lie she was now forced to maintain. She accepted their condolences on Linnea’s condition with a placid mask, her heart a knot of guilt. She was the shepherdess of a flock celebrating a miracle, while secretly knowing the sacrificial lamb lay dying in her arms, not for their sins, but for their roses.

Finally, after another night spent watching Linnea’s shallow, barely-there breaths mist in the cold air of the room, Reverend Mother Agnes knew her own resources had failed. Her prayers, her knowledge of the soul, the earthly remedies of her community—all were useless against this deep, elemental wound. A new course of action, radical and born of desperation, formed in her mind. Just before dawn, she left the infirmary and walked through the freezing cloister to the rose garden. The bushes were thriving, their vitality an almost obscene mockery of Linnea’s stillness. With a small, sharp knife, she made a careful incision in the ancient mother plant, the one she had seen Linnea touch. She took a single, perfect cutting, a stem vibrant with the life it had stolen. Returning to the infirmary, she placed the cutting in a glass of water on the bedside table, its green leaves a stark splash of life against the pale tableau of the sickbed. Then, she knelt, not as an abbess before her God, but as a supplicant before a mystery she did not understand. She did not pray to God for a miracle. She prayed to the life within the rose itself, hoping the echo of Linnea’s own spirit trapped within it might call her back.

The living stem in the glass of water did nothing. It remained vibrant, but Linnea remained still. The last arrow in Agnes’s spiritual quiver had missed its mark. There was only one path left, one that required her to step outside the stone walls of her faith and admit that her world did not contain the necessary medicine. With a heavy heart and leaden feet, she went to the small, locked storeroom where the possessions of postulants were kept. She found the simple canvas bag marked with Linnea’s name. Inside, among the worn clothes and the book of poetry, was the mobile phone. It felt like a strange, profane artifact in her hands, a slick, cold piece of glass and plastic that represented everything she and her sisters had renounced. For a long moment, she simply stared at it. To use it was to confess her own inadequacy, to admit that a century of faith and prayer was not enough. It was the ultimate act of humility. Taking a deep breath that did little to calm the tremor in her hand, she pressed the button on the side. The screen flared to life, a stark blue eye opening in the dim room. Her old, clumsy fingers navigated the unfamiliar icons until she found the list of contacts. Her eyes scanned the names until one stood out, the only one that felt like it might hold a key. Aksel. With a final, desperate prayer for forgiveness, Reverend Mother Agnes pressed the call button, holding the alien object to her ear and listening to the strange, electronic pulse that was a plea being sent to a world she did not know, for a salvation she could not provide.The electronic ringing on the other end was a sound so alien it felt like a summons from another dimension. In a small, cluttered apartment overlooking a rain-slicked Sofies gate, Aksel Vinter looked up from a sprawling diagram of the equine digestive system. His desk was a chaotic landscape of textbooks, half-empty coffee mugs, and highlighted lecture notes. When his phone lit up the gloom, he smiled, seeing Linnea’s name. He imagined her calling on a whim, bored on a late tram, wanting to argue about the merits of a new indie band he’d sent her. He swiped to answer, leaning back in his chair, the picture of casual, brotherly affection. "Hey, you. Shouldn't you be contemplating the eternal mysteries or something? Don't tell me you've butt-dialed me during vespers again."

The voice that answered was not Linnea’s. It was old, female, and carried a weight of formal authority that was utterly at odds with the easy intimacy he expected. It was a voice as dry and ancient as a pressed flower in a forgotten book. "Am I speaking with Aksel Vinter?" The formality itself was an alarm bell. "Yes. Who is this?" Aksel asked, his smile vanishing as he sat bolt upright. "This is Reverend Mother Agnes, of the Carmelite convent at Grefsen. I am calling on behalf of Sister Linnea." Aksel’s blood ran cold. He gripped the edge of his desk, his mind-reeling through a dozen catastrophic scenarios, each one ending with Linnea’s secret being discovered. Had she finally wilted a bully’s prize-winning roses on a grander scale? Had her glamour failed? "Is she alright? What's happened?" he demanded, his voice sharp with a sudden, protective urgency.

There was a pause on the other end, a moment of carefully chosen hesitation. "She has fallen ill," the Reverend Mother said, her tone measured, but underscored with a desperate gravity that transcended the crackling phone line. "There was a… spiritual trial. She collapsed during the Vigil Mass, two weeks ago. We believed it to be an exhaustion of the spirit, a fever of the soul. But she does not wake. She is not in a fever, Mr. Vinter. She is cold. It is a coldness I do not understand and cannot fight. A chill that seems to come from the very centre of her being, a depletion so profound that no earthly warmth can touch it." Her voice, stripped of all pious comfort, was simply the voice of a physician at the end of her knowledge, describing a symptom she had no name for.

Aksel listened, his scientific mind racing, but filtering the information through the dark, fairy-tale lens of his family’s secret. *Spiritual trial. Depletion. Cold.* The words were theological, but the reality they described was brutally biological, in a way the Reverend Mother could never comprehend. It wasn’t a metaphor. Linnea had spent herself. That was the only explanation. She had poured her own life, her own vital heat, into something, and now there was nothing left. The vet in him took over, his voice shedding all familial warmth and becoming the clipped, focused tone of a clinician in an emergency. "What is her core temperature?" he asked, the question so abrupt it seemed to startle the old woman. "Not her forehead, I need to know her core temperature. Is her skin mottled? What is her respiration rate? How many breaths per minute?"

The silence on the other end was one of pure shock. This was not the response of a worried relative; it was the interrogation of a doctor who already suspected the diagnosis. "I… I do not know these things," Reverend Mother Agnes stammered, her authority completely undone by the barrage of clinical questions. "She is just… cold. And still." Aksel stood up, already grabbing his jacket from the back of his chair, his mind a whirlwind of thermodynamics and folklore. "Don't move her," he commanded, his voice leaving no room for argument. "Keep her as warm as you can, but don't use direct heat on her skin. I'm coming. I can be there in thirty minutes." He paused, a wild, desperate thought striking him. "Do you have honey? Or sugar? Mix it with a little warm water. Don’t try to make her drink. Just use a cloth and moisten her lips with it. Do it now." He didn't wait for a reply. He ended the call, leaving a stunned abbess holding a dead phone in a silent infirmary. He grabbed his car keys and a heavy wool blanket from his sofa, his apartment and his studies forgotten. He was no longer a student cramming for an exam. He was the sole physician for a patient of one, and he was driving into the heart of a faith that had no concept of the disease it was harbouring.Aksel drove like a man possessed, his small, aging Peugeot groaning in protest as he pushed it through the slick, glittering streets of Oslo. The city he usually loved for its orderly, predictable hum now felt like an obstacle course, a labyrinth of traffic lights and indifferent pedestrians slowing his desperate ascent. His mind was a frantic, cross-referencing engine, pulling up protocols for profound hypothermia in mammals—circulatory collapse, cardiac arrhythmia, the paradoxical undressing seen in freezing victims—and slamming them against the jagged, half-forgotten truths of his childhood. He remembered his step-mother, Linnea's mother, sitting with him once by a stream, telling him how the life of her kind was not a steady flame like a human's, but a deep, slow reservoir of energy, like water behind a dam. It could be spent. It could be given away. And the world, she had said with a sad, knowing smile, was always thirsty. *Spiritual trial. Depletion. Cold.* The nun's words were a poetic gloss on a terrifyingly literal truth. Linnea hadn't had a crisis of faith; she had made a catastrophic expenditure of self.

As he climbed the steep, winding road to Grefsen, the city fell away, its electric glow replaced by the deep, imposing darkness of the forest. The rain stopped, and the air grew sharp and clean, scented with pine and cold earth. He was crossing a border, leaving the world of quantifiable data and entering the realm of things his textbooks had no name for. He felt like a fraud, a man of science armed with a wool blanket and a half-remembered fairy tale, about to storm a fortress of faith to treat a mythological condition. The absurdity of it was a hysterical bubble in his chest, but beneath it lay a cold, hard certainty: he was the only person on the planet who could translate the nun's 'fever of the soul' into the grim diagnosis of 'catastrophic bio-energetic expenditure'. He was Linnea’s only interpreter, the only one who spoke both the language of her blood and the language of his.

The convent walls rose out of the darkness, a formidable, ancient presence under the cold starlight. He pulled the car onto the gravel verge, the crunching of the tires a profane noise in the profound silence. He grabbed the blanket and his worn leather satchel—a veterinary bag filled with stethoscopes and syringes he now realised were utterly useless—and pulled the brass bell. The clear, resonant toll was the sound of one world demanding entry into another. The small wooden hatch slid open, and the startled face of a young novice peered out. Aksel, wild-eyed, his hair damp from the rain, his voice tight with urgency, did not wait for the question. "I'm Aksel Vinter. Reverend Mother Agnes is expecting me. It's an emergency." The sheer force of his presence, so alien to the convent’s placid rhythm, was enough. The gate was unbolted, and he stepped across the threshold, feeling the city fall away behind him like a shed skin.

Reverend Mother Agnes was waiting for him in the cloister, a dark, motionless figure against the pale stone. The frantic energy of his arrival seemed to break against the immovable wall of her stillness. For a moment, they simply stared at each other, two generals from opposing armies meeting under a flag of truce, each the sovereign of a world the other could not comprehend. Her ancient, weary eyes took in his modern clothes, his desperate urgency, and the strange, useless-looking bag in his hand. His clinical gaze swept over her, noting the profound fatigue etched into the lines of her face, the faint tremor in her clasped hands. He saw not an abbess, but a caregiver at the absolute end of her rope. "Where is she?" he asked, his voice softer than he intended, the shared weight of their desperate purpose creating an instant, unwilling intimacy. Without a word, she turned and led him through the echoing, silent corridors, his hurried, squeaking footsteps a jarring counterpoint to her silent, gliding progress.

The infirmary was a cell of cold air and shadows, smelling faintly of yarrow and despair. Linnea lay on the cot, a still form under a mountain of blankets, her face a pale, luminous oval in the dim light. Aksel stopped dead in the doorway, the sight of her stealing the air from his lungs. The vet in him took over instantly, a cold, diagnostic calm descending. He brushed past the Reverend Mother, dropped his bag and the blanket, and went to the cot. He ignored the heated stones, the signs of a futile, loving battle against the cold. He pulled back the blankets and laid his hand on Linnea’s arm. The cold was shocking. It was not the passive cold of a body losing heat to the environment; it was an active, consuming cold that seemed to draw the warmth from his own hand. He pressed two fingers to her neck, searching for the carotid artery. The pulse was there, but it was a ghostly, thready flutter, a signal from a life retreating to its deepest, most inaccessible fortress. He lifted one of her eyelids. Her pupil was a fixed, dark pool, unresponsive to the light from the doorway. His heart clenched. This was profound metabolic shutdown, a state hovering perilously close to the biological definition of death. He turned to the Reverend Mother, his face a grim mask. "You said there was a spiritual trial. What happened on the night she collapsed? Tell me everything."### Chapter 7

Reverend Mother Agnes stood as immovable as the stone pillars of the cloister, her hands clasped before her, absorbing the raw, frantic energy of Aksel’s grief and fear. She did not look away from his furious, questioning eyes. The time for pious ambiguity was over; the truth, or a part of it, was the only coin that had currency in this room. “There was a frost,” she said, her voice low and steady, stripped of all authority and left with only the weight of confession. “An unexpected, killing frost. Sister Linnea knew it was coming hours before it arrived. She felt it. She came to me in the chapel, in a state much like your own now, and she warned me.” She paused, her gaze flickering to the still form on the cot. “I had the sisters cover the ‘Rosa Sancta’, our most precious roses. But she and I both knew it would not be enough. The cold was… a predator. I told her to do what she must. I told her that her gifts were from God, and it was no sin to use them to serve His creation.” Her voice faltered for the first time, a hairline crack in the granite of her composure. “I did not understand. I thought it would be a prayer. I did not know it would be a sacrifice.”

Aksel stared at her, the pieces of the puzzle locking into place with a series of brutal, internal clicks. The roses. The frost. It was a story so mythic it would have been absurd, if the consequence of it were not lying cold and still a few feet away. A wave of fury, so pure and cold it momentarily eclipsed his fear, washed over him. He took a step towards the old woman, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. “A sacrifice?” he repeated, his voice a low, dangerous snarl. “You let her immolate herself for your flowers. You saw what she was, this strange, unique, living thing, and you used her like a furnace. You didn’t ask her to serve God; you asked her to serve your garden.” He gestured wildly at Linnea’s form. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done? This isn’t a spiritual crisis. This is catastrophic energy expenditure. She’s not sick, she’s empty. She poured her own life, her own warmth, out into the dirt. You didn't witness a sacrifice; you sanctioned a suicide.”

The abbess flinched as if he had struck her, but she did not look away. She absorbed the truth of his words, the brutal, scientific translation of her own poetic folly. The guilt that had been her solitary companion for weeks was now mirrored in this strange man’s eyes, amplified and sharpened into a weapon. “Your anger is just, Mr. Vinter,” she whispered, her face ashen. “My pride was in my understanding. I thought I could guide her, that I could help her consecrate her nature. I was a fool. A proud, ignorant old woman who mistook a force of nature for a novice with a peculiar gift for gardening.” Her confession was absolute, stripped of any attempt at self-preservation. It was the most profound act of contrition he had ever witnessed, but it did nothing to warm the girl on the bed.

His anger, having no purchase on her utter self-abasement, receded, leaving behind the cold, hard urgency of the problem. He began to pace the tiny room, his mind racing. Blankets, heated stones, sugar water—they were trying to fill a reservoir with an eyedropper. “We can’t fix this here,” he said, more to himself than to her. He stopped and looked at the single rose cutting in the glass of water by the bed, its leaves vibrant and alive. A mockery. “You had the right idea,” he conceded, his voice grudging. “Life for life. But you brought a cutting. We need the forest. You brought a cup of water from the river; we need to throw her in the river.” He turned to face the Reverend Mother, his eyes blazing with a desperate, wild plan. “I have to get her out of here. I have to get her to the earth. The living earth. This place,” he swept a hand around the cold, stone room, “it’s a tomb. It’s all stone and faith and memory. She needs mud and roots and running water. Now.”

Horror dawned on the Reverend Mother’s face, overriding her guilt. “You cannot be serious,” she breathed. “To take her out into the night? Into the cold that nearly killed her? She would be dead before you reached the gate. It is madness.” It was the protest of a rational mind, the voice of a caregiver who knew that a patient in such a state needed warmth and shelter above all else. Aksel stepped close to her, his voice dropping to a low, intense plea. “She is dying of the cold from the *inside* out. The cold outside doesn’t matter. Don’t you understand? Her system isn’t human. It doesn’t generate heat from calories; it draws it from the world. It is terrestrial. It is pagan. It needs contact with its source. She’s like a plant pulled from the soil. Her roots are withering. We have to replant her, or she will die right here in this bed, surrounded by your prayers and your perfectly warm roses.”

His words, a bizarre fusion of biology and folklore, hung in the air. Reverend Mother Agnes stared at him, at the fierce, undeniable certainty in his eyes. She had trusted her own knowledge, and it had led them to this precipice. Her faith, her rules, her understanding of the soul had all failed. Now, this wild man, this emissary from a world of science and myth she did not comprehend, was offering a different path. It was a terrifying, heretical, and insane path. And in the deepest part of her soul, she knew it was the only one they had left. The battle within her was brief and brutal. A lifetime of order and doctrine warred with the stark evidence of the dying girl on the cot. Her faith had not been enough. She had to have faith in something else. She gave a single, sharp nod, the movement conveying a final, complete surrender of her own authority. “What do you require?”

The truce was forged in that moment, a desperate, unspoken alliance between the abbess and the veterinarian. A frantic, quiet energy filled the room. Aksel worked with a grim, focused efficiency, his movements economical and precise. “More blankets. All of them. And the strongest sisters you have. Not to pray. To carry.” Reverend Mother Agnes moved to obey, a silent shadow flitting from the room. Aksel knelt by Linnea, speaking to her in a low, urgent murmur, as if she could hear him. “Hang on, Lin. Just hang on. We’re going home.” He wrapped her in the heavy blanket he had brought, then another, cocooning her still, cold form until she was a shapeless bundle. When the abbess returned with two of the strongest, most stoic-looking nuns, their faces a mixture of confusion and unquestioning obedience, Aksel gave them their instructions. Together, in the dead of the Nordic night, the four of them lifted their precious, fragile burden. They moved through the sleeping convent like a secret procession, a strange cabal of faith and science and paganism, united in a single, desperate purpose. They carried the source of their miracle out of the stone fortress of God, back towards the wild, dark heart of the world that had made her.## Chapter 8

The iron gate of the Carmelite convent closed behind them with a soft, final click, a sound that severed one world from the next. The manicured peace of the grounds, with its ordered paths and sleeping, miraculous roses, was gone. In its place was the vast, untamed darkness of Nordmarka. The air, which had been still within the walls, was alive out here, carrying the rich, complex scents of damp soil, decaying pine needles, and the clean, cold smell of running water somewhere nearby. The four of them stood for a moment in the deep shadow of the forest’s edge, a bizarre and desperate fellowship: a veterinarian armed with myth, an abbess stripped of her certainty, and two stoic nuns whose faith was now being tested not by scripture, but by the raw, physical reality of this strange, heretical mission. The only light came from the cold, distant stars and a sliver of moon that did little to penetrate the thick canopy of firs.

Aksel led them, not towards the faint hiking path that skirted the convent property, but directly into the tangled undergrowth, his steps guided by a desperate, primal instinct. He was searching for something he couldn't name, a place he would only know when he felt it. The two nuns, Sisters Perpetua and Clare, carried the bulk of Linnea’s weight between them, their movements surprisingly deft for women accustomed to the smooth stone floors of the cloister. They did not complain or question, their faces set in masks of grim obedience, their trust placed entirely in their Reverend Mother, who walked just behind them, her hand hovering near Linnea’s shrouded form as if to offer a final, useless blessing. Her penance was in every stumbling step, every sharp branch that snagged at her habit, every lungful of wild, pagan air she drew. This was the world she had so long held at bay, the chaotic wilderness her faith was meant to conquer and order. Now, she was a supplicant in its court, begging it to restore a life her own ordered world had nearly extinguished.

After a ten-minute trek that felt like an eternity, Aksel stopped. He had found it. It was a small, hollowed-out clearing, a natural amphitheatre sheltered by the interlocking roots of three ancient spruces whose dark forms blotted out the sky. A small, quick-running brook cut through the clearing, its water singing a clear, constant song as it tumbled over moss-covered stones. The air here was different, thick with the palpable energy of deep, undisturbed life. It was a place that felt older than the convent, older than the city, older than the faith that had been brought to these shores. It was a nexus of terrestrial power, and as soon as he stepped into it, Aksel felt a faint resonance in his own bones, a thrumming that told him he was in the right place. He turned to the others, his face grim in the deep shadows. “Here,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “Lay her down here. By the water.”

Gently, they lowered the bundled form to the ground. The moss was a deep, soft carpet beneath her. For a moment, they all stood, looking down at the shapeless cocoon of blankets, the silence of the forest pressing in on them. Then, when Aksel began to unwrap the blankets, a collective, stifled gasp came from the two sisters. As each layer was peeled back, Linnea’s form was revealed, her face impossibly pale, her limbs as limp as a doll’s. Exposing her to the raw, biting air of the night felt like a profound violation, a final act of cruelty. Sister Perpetua instinctively made the sign of the cross, her lips moving in a silent, desperate prayer. Reverend Mother Agnes simply watched, her heart a cold, heavy stone in her chest, as Aksel stripped away the last vestiges of the convent’s protection, leaving Linnea in only her thin under-shift, a fragile human form against the vast indifference of the wilderness.

He knelt and, with his bare hands, scraped away the thick carpet of last year’s leaves and loose topsoil, exposing the rich, black, living earth beneath. It was cold and damp to the touch, teeming with a million invisible lives. Reverend Mother Agnes knelt opposite him, her old knees protesting, understanding his intent without a word. Then, with a reverence that was both terrifying and holy, he and Agnes lifted Linnea’s limp form and laid her directly upon the exposed, damp, black earth. The contact of her pale skin with the dark soil was a shocking, transgressive intimacy. Aksel then took his hands, cupped them in the freezing brook, and brought the water to her face, letting it trickle over her forehead and lips in a pagan baptism. He laid her arms out at her sides, palms down against the dirt, and gently arranged her hair, which was the colour of dead leaves, around her shoulders. He had done all he could. He had replanted her.

Silence fell, thick and absolute, broken only by the hushed murmur of the brook and the sigh of the wind in the high pine branches. The four of them formed a strange, motionless vigil around Linnea’s body. The two nuns knelt a few feet away, their heads bowed, their prayers no longer the formal petitions of the chapel but a raw, desperate plea sent out into the terrifying darkness. Reverend Mother Agnes remained on her knees beside Linnea, her hands clasped so tightly her knuckles were white. Her own prayer was a silent, unravelling scream. She had offered this soul to God, and now she was offering her to the earth, the mud, the trees, the water. She was a high priestess of a faith she did not know, trusting in a liturgy of soil and instinct. The boundaries of her world had dissolved, and in their place was only the cold night, the dying girl, and a fragile, terrifying hope. She was no longer an abbess. She was simply a woman waiting for a miracle, without any certainty of who, or what, might grant it.

Hours passed. The moon climbed higher, its light filtering through the branches in shifting, dappled coins that moved across Linnea’s still face. The cold deepened. Aksel, who had never taken his fingers from the faint pulse point at her neck, remained as motionless as a predator on a hunt, his entire being focused on that one, fragile connection to her life. He felt nothing. The pulse remained a ghostly flutter, her skin a landscape of unnatural cold. Doubt, a venomous serpent, began to coil in his gut. His plan had been madness, a desperate gamble based on folklore and a vet student’s intuition. He had brought her out here only to die in the cold, heretical dark. But then, just as the first hint of grey began to lighten the eastern sky, he felt it. It was not a surge. It was a change so subtle he almost dismissed it as wishful thinking. A slight lessening of the profound cold under his fingertips. He pressed his other hand flat against the earth beside her. The soil was cold. But the skin of her arm, he was sure of it, was fractionally, impossibly, less cold. A faint, almost imperceptible warmth was beginning to seep into her not from the air, not from his own hand, but from the earth beneath her. The planet itself was breathing life back into her. His head snapped up, and his eyes met the Reverend Mother’s across Linnea’s body. He didn't need to speak. In the dim, pre-dawn light, she saw the flicker of wild, astonished hope in his eyes, and for the first time in weeks, she felt the icy grip of despair on her own soul begin to loosen.The hope was a fragile, terrifying thing, a single flickering candle in a vast, dark cathedral. Aksel did not dare to move, did not dare to breathe, his entire universe condensed into the point of contact between his fingers and Linnea's neck, his palm and the cold earth. He was a living bridge, monitoring the impossible transaction. The change was agonizingly slow, a geological process rather than a biological one. It was the slow turning of a tide, the almost imperceptible creep of lichen across stone. He watched as the bluish, translucent quality of her skin began to recede, replaced by an opaque, creamy paleness. It was like watching a watercolour painting slowly dry, its pigments settling and gaining substance. He could feel it now, not just in her skin, but in the ground itself. The earth beneath his own hand felt subtly warmer, as if it were a massive, slow-burning hearth, and Linnea was the focal point, drawing its deep, geothermal energy into her own depleted core.

Reverend Mother Agnes saw the change in Aksel’s face before she dared to feel it for herself. The fierce, desperate tension in his jaw had eased, replaced by a look of profound, incredulous concentration. Slowly, tentatively, as if she were reaching out to touch the Eucharist, she extended her own trembling hand and laid it gently on Linnea’s free arm. The cold was still there, but it no longer felt like a void. It was a passive cold now, the simple chill of the morning air, not the active, life-stealing emptiness of before. Beneath it, deep in the tissues, was a nascent warmth, a promise of life as faint and as real as the first tremor of a chick within its shell. A single, silent tear traced a path through the dirt on her aged cheek. This was not a violation of her faith. It was a terrifying, humbling expansion of it. She was witnessing the raw, unmediated grace of Creation, a power that predated catechism and creed. God was not just in the chapel; He was in the mud, in the roots, in the ancient, breathing darkness of the world, and He was answering a prayer she had not even known how to speak.

As the dawn bled from grey to a pale, watercolour wash of rose and gold, the forest began to stir around them. The first tentative chirp of a finch cut through the air, followed by another, and then another, until the clearing was filled with a complex, awakening chorus. The first rays of sunlight pierced the canopy, spearing down to illuminate the scene in shafts of golden light. And as the sun touched her face, Linnea drew a breath. It was not the shallow, ghostly flutter of before. It was a deep, shuddering inhalation that seemed to draw the very soul of the morning into her lungs. Her eyelids, which had been as still as carved marble, trembled. Her fingers, which lay pale against the black soil, curled slightly, gripping the earth as a babe might grip its mother’s finger. Sister Perpetua let out a choked, half-strangled sob of pure, unadulterated awe, her companion reaching out to steady her. They were witnesses to a resurrection, one that would not be found in any hagiography, a miracle of soil and sap and sunlight.

Aksel felt the breath as a profound shudder that ran through her entire body. He pressed his fingers more firmly against her neck and felt the pulse, no longer a faint, thready ghost, but a slow, steady, and strengthening beat. *Thump. Thump. Thump.* It was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard, a rhythm pulled from the very heart of the earth. The vet in him registered the vital signs with clinical satisfaction, but the man, the brother, was undone. A great, shuddering tremor wracked his own body as the tension of the long, terrible night finally broke. He bowed his head, resting his forehead on the back of his hand still pressed to the earth, and a sound that was half-sob, half-laugh escaped his lips. He had wagered her life on a fairy tale, and the ancient, wild magic had answered. He looked up, his eyes blurred with tears, and met the gaze of the Reverend Mother. In her face, he saw not the stern abbess of a cloistered faith, but a fellow traveler who had just journeyed with him to the edge of the world and back, and was as irrevocably changed by the experience as he was. The abyss between their two worlds had been bridged, and the bridge was the sleeping, breathing girl lying on the forest floor between them.The first sensation was warmth. A gentle, persistent warmth on her eyelids, like the press of a loving hand. It was the warmth of the sun, a force she had not felt in what seemed like an eternity. The second sensation was the earth. She was lying on it, cradled by it, its dampness a cool, soothing poultice against her back and limbs. It did not feel like a bed; it felt like a body, a vast, slow-breathing presence that was holding her. She could feel its life as a deep, resonant hum that vibrated through her bones, a familiar and vital song that her own blood was slowly beginning to remember how to sing. The air smelled of damp moss, of pine, of the clean, sharp scent of running water. It smelled of home. Her eyelids fluttered, heavy as stones, and then opened.

Above her, the intricate, dark lace of spruce branches was stark against a sky of impossible, tender blue. The world swam into focus, resolving into the faces that were looking down at her, a strange and holy triptych. There was Aksel, his face pale and stubbled, etched with a fatigue so profound it looked like grief, but his eyes, when they met hers, shone with a fierce, triumphant relief. And there was the Reverend Mother, her wimple slightly askew, her face stripped of all its austere authority, leaving only the raw, humbled features of an old woman who had stared into an abyss and been granted a reprieve. The other two, the silent, strong sisters, hovered behind them, their expressions a mixture of terror and sublime wonder. Linnea’s gaze drifted from their faces to her own arms, pale against the rich, black soil they rested upon. A memory, distant and sharp, surfaced. The killing cold. The roses. Her own life pouring out of her like water from a broken vessel. Her lips parted, a dry, rasping sound escaping. "Aksel?"

He was beside her in an instant, his hand closing gently around hers. His touch was warm, solid, an anchor in the shifting world. "I'm here, Lin," he murmured, his voice thick with emotion. "You're okay. You're safe." Reverend Mother Agnes knelt on the other side, her movements slow and stiff, her old knees cracking in protest. She did not reach for Linnea, but simply looked at her, her eyes filled with a sorrow and a gratitude so profound it was almost unbearable. "The roses are safe, child," she said, her voice a low, broken whisper. It was not a statement of fact; it was an apology, a confession, and a promise all in one. Linnea looked from the abbess's ravaged face to Aksel's, then back to the living earth she was lying on, and a sliver of understanding began to dawn. She had not been abandoned to die. She had been brought home.

Aksel, the clinician returning, took a deep, steadying breath. "Alright," he said, his voice gaining a measure of its usual confidence. "We need to get you back. You need to rest. Properly, this time." He looked at the two silent sisters, then at the Reverend Mother, his gaze now one of a collaborator, not an antagonist. The desperate, frantic energy of the night was gone, replaced by a quiet, shared purpose. The mission was no longer about a frantic, heretical rescue; it was now a slow, careful, and sacred recovery. He began to gently brush the soil from Linnea's arms and legs, his movements tender, as if he were cleaning a priceless, fragile artifact. There was a new reverence in his touch, a new understanding of the precious, hybrid thing his sister was.

The journey back was a slow, solemn procession. Sisters Perpetua and Clare lifted Linnea, their movements now infused with a careful, gentle awe. She was no longer a mysterious patient but a living relic, a girl who had died in the cold and been resurrected by the earth. The sun was higher now, its light slanting through the trees, turning the forest from a place of menacing darkness into a cathedral of green and gold. The air was alive with the birdsong and the scent of burgeoning spring. Aksel and Reverend Mother Agnes walked side-by-side, following the makeshift litter. They did not speak. There were no words for the experience that now bound them together. They were the sole keepers of a truth far stranger and more beautiful than the simple miracle the convent would celebrate. They had stepped outside the bounds of their known worlds and had met in a place of wild, primal mystery, and neither of them would ever be able to fully return.

As they reached the edge of the forest, the high stone walls of the convent came into view, solid and orderly in the morning light. The iron gate was opened for them by a startled lay sister, her mouth agape at the sight of the strange procession emerging from the woods. They stepped back across the threshold, from the world of wild, unpredictable grace into the world of structure and enclosure. As they entered the cloister garden, the sun struck the ‘Rosa Sancta’ bushes. They seemed to blaze with an inner light, their leaves a defiant, impossible green, their health a vibrant, silent testimony to the secret they now carried. Other sisters, drawn by the commotion, began to emerge from the chapel and the refectory, their faces turning from confusion to astonished joy at the sight of Linnea, awake, alive, carried between them like a returning queen. They saw a miracle granted. Aksel and the Reverend Mother saw the miracle they had been forced to make, and they carried the beautiful, heavy weight of its truth back into the heart of the convent.The infirmary, when they returned to it, was no longer a place of sterile cold and despair. It was a sanctuary, a quiet harbour after a long and terrifying voyage. As Linnea was gently laid upon the cot, the other sisters who had gathered in the corridor were held back by a single, quiet look from Reverend Mother Agnes. Her authority, once rooted in the rigid enforcement of the Carmelite Rule, now emanated from a deeper, more formidable source. She had walked through a fire the others could not imagine, and the experience had forged her into something new, something unbreakable. They saw the mud on her habit, the exhaustion on her face, and the profound, unreadable mystery in her eyes, and they retreated without a word, leaving the three keepers of the secret alone.

Aksel, moving with a gentleness that belied his own bone-deep weariness, dismissed the mountain of blankets and began his own examination. It was a tender pantomime of his veterinary training, a series of familiar gestures made sacred by the night's events. He took her pulse, not with clinical detachment, but with a brother's loving reassurance, feeling the strong, steady, earthy rhythm of it beneath his fingertips. He looked into her eyes, which were now clear and focused, the grey-green of a fjord after a storm has passed. She was weak, her limbs heavy with a profound but healthy exhaustion, but she was present. She was whole. The terrible, consuming cold was gone, replaced by a deep, calm warmth that seemed to radiate from her very core.

“You’ll be weak for a while,” he said, his voice soft. “You’ve... used up your reserves. You need to rest, eat. No more miracles for at least a century, alright?” A faint smile touched Linnea’s lips. She looked from her brother’s tired, loving face to the solemn, watchful figure of the Reverend Mother. There were a thousand questions she wanted to ask, a universe of gratitude she wanted to express, but her body was a leaden weight, her voice a mere whisper. “Thank you,” she breathed, the simple words directed at them both, encompassing the entire desperate, mad, and holy night. Reverend Mother Agnes simply inclined her head, a gesture of profound, shared understanding that was more eloquent than any sermon. The chasm between their worlds had closed, and they were left standing together on the new, strange, hallowed ground they had created.

Later, as the full morning sun streamed through the infirmary window, Reverend Mother Agnes walked Aksel to the gate. The convent was stirring with a new, joyful energy, the miracle of the roses now compounded by the miraculous recovery of Sister Linnea. The truth of it all was a secret society of two, walking through a world that could not comprehend it. “She will need sunlight,” Aksel said, his tone that of a doctor giving discharge instructions, though his words were a strange new scripture. “And clean water. And good soil. Not just in the garden. For her. It's what her body needs to heal.” He looked at the abbess, his eyes full of a new, hard-won respect. “You’ll need to let her be in the world again. Your world, and the other one.”

Reverend Mother Agnes looked out past the gate, towards the deep, living green of the forest. Her fortress had been breached, her theology broken open and remade. "This place was meant to be a sanctuary from the world," she said, her voice quiet and reflective. "Perhaps now it must become a sanctuary *for* a part of the world we had forgotten how to honour. The garden will be her infirmary and her chapel. She will have all the sun and soil she requires.” She turned to face him, offering not a handshake, but a rare, small smile that reached her weary eyes. "You are a good man, Aksel Vinter. A man of science, and of great faith, though you may not call it that." Aksel shrugged, a faint blush rising on his neck. "I'm a vet," he said simply. "I just want her to be healthy." He gave a final nod, a silent acknowledgment of their impossible alliance, and walked through the gate to his car, leaving the convent and its wild, new secret in her capable hands.

Spring deepened into a summer of breathtaking vitality. The ‘Rosa Sancta’, fed by a power they could not name, bloomed with a profusion and fragrance that had not been seen in living memory. Pilgrims and botanists began to visit, marveling at the impossible health of the plants, their presence turning the quiet convent into a site of minor, cheerful renown. And at the heart of it all was Linnea. She did not return to the formal life of a postulant, to the strict schedule of bells and communal prayers. By the silent decree of the Reverend Mother, she was given a new, singular role. She became the Anchoress of the Garden.

Her days were spent among the plants, her hands perpetually stained with soil. She moved with a slow, graceful deliberation, her body finally in harmony with its own rhythms. The glamour she had once painstakingly maintained fell away within the convent walls, not by choice, but by simple irrelevance. The sisters grew accustomed to her strange, quiet ways, to the otherworldly pallor of her skin that would flush with a healthy, earthy glow after a day in the sun, to her habit of standing motionless for long periods, her head cocked as if listening to a conversation no one else could hear. They no longer saw her as ill or eccentric; they saw her as blessed, a kind of holy innocent whose connection to God’s creation was purer and more direct than their own. Sister Elin, her own knowledge now feeling book-learned and shallow, would come to Linnea not to instruct, but to ask, "What do the beans need today, Sister? They seem sad to me." And Linnea, after a moment of quiet listening, would answer, "They are thirsty for iron. We should feed them with nettle tea."

Her back still ached when the pressure dropped, and the knot of her tail still throbbed before a storm, but these were no longer symptoms of a shameful, hidden otherness. They were her instruments, her tools of perception, the language through which the world spoke to her. She had come to the convent seeking to build a cage for the wild thing inside her. Instead, she had been taught to build it a cathedral. One evening, as dusk painted the sky in shades of violet and rose, Reverend Mother Agnes joined her in the garden. They stood together in comfortable silence for a long time, the air thick with the scent of blooming roses and damp earth. "I used to believe faith was a fortress," the old abbess said at last, her voice soft in the twilight. "A high wall to keep the chaos of the world at bay." She looked at Linnaea, whose hands were resting in a bed of dark, rich soil, her face serene and utterly at peace. "I was wrong. It is not a fortress. It is a garden. A place where all things, even the wildest and most unexpected, can be consecrated, tended, and taught to grow toward the light." Linnea looked up, her fjord-grey eyes reflecting the last light of the day, and smiled. She had finally learned to speak the language of this place, a quiet, growing dialect of praise. She was a creature of two worlds, at home at last in the sacred space between them.## Chapter 9

The high summer settled over the convent like a benediction. The sun, a generous and constant presence in the Nordic sky, poured down a relentless, life-giving warmth. Under Linnea’s strange and silent stewardship, the garden had become a place of almost riotous holiness. The vegetables grew with a fierce, quiet determination, their leaves a deep, glossy green, their fruits swelling with a flavour so intense it felt like a form of prayer. The herbs were pungent, their oils so concentrated that a bruised leaf of basil or mint could scent the entire cloister walk. And the roses, the famous ‘Rosa Sancta’, were a constant, rolling miracle. They bloomed with an almost sentient enthusiasm, their thornless stems thick with clusters of white, fragrant blossoms that seemed to drink the sunlight and radiate it back as pure, unblemished beauty. The convent hummed with a quiet, joyful prosperity, its larders full, its small chapel perpetually adorned with the impossible bounty of its garden.

Linnea had found the rhythm she had so long sought, not in the tolling of the bell, but in the life of the soil. She rose with the sun and slept when the last light faded, her body attuned to the great, slow clockwork of the turning earth. She no longer thought of herself as a creature of two worlds, but as a citizen of the borderlands, a translator whose work was to interpret the silent, insistent pleas of the green and growing world into the language of human care. The sisters now deferred to her completely in all matters of the garden. They would watch in quiet awe as she stood for long moments, her head tilted, before announcing that the deep roots of the apple tree were thirsty, or that a shadow of blight was gathering over the potato patch, a declaration that always preceded the visible evidence by days. She had become their oracle of the earth, her strangeness no longer a sign of alienation but of a unique and sacred connection. She was at peace. The quiet emptiness that had driven her from the city had been filled, not with the structured certainty of dogma, but with the deep, living hum of the world she now served.

The first sign of disturbance came not as a crash of thunder but as a subtle dissonance in the garden’s symphony. It was a late afternoon in August, the air thick and golden, heavy with the scent of sun-baked earth and roses. Linnea was on her knees, thinning a bed of late-season carrots, her hands moving with a practiced, meditative grace. Suddenly, a tremor of wrongness went through the soil, a silent, psychic shudder that had nothing to do with the earth itself. The hum of life around her faltered, replaced by a tense, listening quiet. The birds in the apple tree fell silent. Linnea froze, her fingers buried in the warm dirt. She felt a prickling sensation spread across her skin, a familiar, ancestral alarm. From the deep woods beyond the convent walls, a pulse of power emanated, a wave of raw, potent Huldra magic so concentrated it felt like a physical blow. It was a signature she had not felt since she was a small child, standing at the edge of a forest clearing, watching her mother vanish into the trees. It was the call of the alpha, the summons of the queen.

Throughout the evening, the feeling grew, a gathering storm on a horizon no one else could see. The ache returned to the hollow of her back, but this was a new pain, sharp and demanding, a resonance with the power that was now circling the convent’s walls like a patient predator. She attended Vespers, kneeling amongst the sisters, their calm, melodic chants a fragile shield against the wild, silent roar that only she could hear. She saw Reverend Mother Agnes glance at her, a flicker of concern in the old woman’s eyes. Linnea offered a small, reassuring shake of her head, but the lie was a lead weight in her stomach. The peace she had so carefully cultivated was a thin sheet of ice over a deep, turbulent ocean, and that ocean was beginning to surge.

Later, as twilight bled the colour from the garden, she found herself drawn back to the wall where the forest pressed closest. The air was cool now, and the presence was overwhelming, a silent, oppressive weight. She stood by the old espaliered pear tree, its branches clinging to the warm stone, and stared into the impenetrable darkness of the woods. She did not have to wait long. A figure detached itself from the deep shadows, stepping into the gloaming with a fluid, silent grace that was utterly inhuman. It was her mother. She looked exactly as she had the day she left, a woman of impossible, ageless beauty, with hair the colour of autumn leaves and eyes that held the wild, amoral light of the forest itself. Her glamour was less a disguise and more a weapon, a shimmering cloak of allure and danger. She stopped just on the other side of a low section of the wall, her gaze sweeping over Linnea, taking in the simple grey habit, the dirt-stained hands, the aura of placid domestication that clung to her like a shroud. A slow, contemptuous smile touched her lips.

“So,” her mother’s voice was a low, musical purr, the sound of a panther observing a caged bird. “This is what has become of my daughter. A gardener for a flock of sterile women. A pet. I felt your power gutter like a cheap candle months ago. I have been following the stench of it ever since. I find you here, in this stone box, smelling of prayer and decay, tending their pathetic little patch of weeds.” She gestured dismissively at the miraculous roses, which seemed to shrink in her presence. “They broke you. They took your fire and used it to warm their own cold beds.”

A tremor went through Linnea, a mixture of childhood fear and a new, unfamiliar anger. “They did not break me,” she said, her voice stronger than she expected. “They saved me. I was empty, Mother. I was dying in their world. This place… it gave me a purpose.”

Her mother laughed, a sound like the cracking of ice. “A purpose? To be a beast of burden? To pour out your life for their flowers? That is not a purpose; it is slavery. You are of the Huldre, Linnea. Our power is for claiming territory, for charming men to their doom, for bargaining with the seasons. It is for ruling, not for serving. You have taken a gift of the wild and turned it into a plough horse.” She leaned forward, her eyes glowing with a faint, predatory light. “This place is a tomb. Its walls are built of fear and its faith is a poison that weakens the blood. I have come to take you home. Before there is nothing left of you worth saving.” She held out a hand, its nails long and perfectly formed, an invitation that was also a command. “Come with me, now. Leave this cage. Come back to the deep woods, where you belong.”

Linnea looked at her mother’s outstretched hand, and for a heart-stopping moment, the old, deep longing surged within her. The desire to shed the skin of humanity, to run wild and free, to belong completely to the ancient, powerful world her mother represented. But then she looked around at the peaceful, thriving garden, at the stone walls that were no longer a prison but a sanctuary, at the distant, warm light of the chapel window. This was her garden. These were her people. She had built a life here, a fragile, hybrid, beautiful thing. She was not a plough horse. She was a bridge. “No,” Linnea said, her voice quiet but firm, a stone dropped into a deep well. “This is my home now. I belong here.”

Her mother’s smile vanished. Her face, for a fleeting instant, became something ancient and terrible, her glamour slipping to reveal the raw, elemental power beneath. The air grew cold, and the scent of the roses was suddenly overwhelmed by the smell of ozone and wet stone. “You choose this cage, then? You choose them over your own blood?” she hissed, her voice losing its musicality and taking on the grating sound of rockfall. “Very well. But understand this, little gardener. My domain borders this place. I will not suffer a blight of prayer and stone so close to my heartwood. I will not allow my daughter to be a pet for a dying faith. You have until the next full moon. Leave them. Or I will cleanse this place myself. I will tear down their walls, sour their well, and show these timid women what it means to build their nest in the shadow of a power they have forgotten to fear.” With that, she turned and melted back into the forest, leaving behind only the profound, sudden silence and the cold, terrifying certainty of a coming war.The silence her mother left behind was a physical wound. It was not the deep, nourishing silence of the convent, but a dead, ringing vacuum where a terrible power had just been. The air in the garden, moments before thick with the perfume of a thousand rose blossoms, now smelled of cold stone and fear. The vibrant hum of life in the soil, the constant, reassuring chorus Linnea had come to know as intimately as her own heartbeat, was gone, replaced by a tense, listening quiet. Even the miraculous roses seemed to have recoiled, their petals looking frail and pale in the gloaming, their life-force dimmed by the proximity of a greater, wilder, and far more ancient power. Linnea stood frozen, her hands still buried in the cooling earth of the carrot bed, her entire being locked in the grip of a terror she had not felt since childhood. The peace she had found here, the delicate, hard-won balance of her two natures, had been a beautiful but fragile illusion, a sandcastle built just below the high-tide line. The tide was now coming in.

She stumbled back from the wall, her legs trembling, and wrapped her arms around herself. A deep, shuddering cold, the echo of the winter that had almost claimed her, radiated from the base of her spine. Her mother’s threat was not an idle one. She had seen that power before, had felt its casual, terrifying force as a child when a hunter’s dog that had chased her too close to their den had simply dropped dead, its heart stopped by a silent command. She had felt it in the way the weather itself would bend to her mother’s moods, a sunny day clouding over in response to a flicker of her anger. The convent’s stone walls, which had seemed so strong and permanent, now felt as brittle as dried leaves. The faith of the sisters, so pure and steadfast, felt like a small, gentle candle flame in the path of a hurricane. The choice her mother had given her was no choice at all; it was a blade laid to the throat of everything she had come to love. Her existence, her very presence here, had made this place a target. She was the lightning rod, and the storm was coming.

For a moment, the old instinct screamed at her: run. Hide. Disappear into the forest and hope her mother’s wrath did not follow. It would be so easy. But the Linnea who had lived through the last year was not the same woman who had fled the noise of the city. Her life here was not built on hiding, but on a terrifying, liberating act of confession. The trust she had forged with Reverend Mother Agnes on that desperate night in the forest was the bedrock of her new soul. To hide this, to run without a word, would be a betrayal far deeper than any disobedience to her mother's will. It would be a betrayal of herself. She owed these women the truth, even if that truth condemned her, even if their only logical response would be to cast her out to save themselves. Straightening her back, she pulled her hands from the soil, wiping the dirt on her coarse habit, and turned her steps away from the violated peace of the garden. She walked towards the warm light of the main building, towards the abbess’s office, each step a heavy, deliberate choice to face the coming storm rather than be swept away by it.

Reverend Mother Agnes was at her desk, a small pair of spectacles perched on her nose as she reviewed the week’s accounts by the light of a single lamp. The neat columns of figures, the mundane reality of invoices for flour and beeswax, represented the quiet, orderly world that was about to be threatened with mythological annihilation. When the door opened without a knock, she looked up, her expression shifting from mild surprise to immediate concern at the sight of Linnea. The girl stood in the doorway, her face a mask of stark terror, her eyes wide and dark, her entire form vibrating with a desperate, frantic energy that Agnes had not seen since the night of the frost. The abbess slowly took off her spectacles and set them down on the ledger, her full attention fixed on the girl. “Linnea,” she said, her voice calm but freighted with alarm. “What is it? What has happened?”

Linnea closed the door behind her and leaned against it, as if to hold the darkness of the forest at bay. The words came out in a torrent, a desperate, jumbled confession. “She was here. In the garden. My mother.” She saw the instant flash of understanding in the abbess’s eyes. This was not a confession about a wayward parent; this was a report from a border guard announcing an invasion. “She knows I am here. She is… displeased. She thinks I am a slave. She says this place is a tomb, a blight on her lands.” Linnea’s breath hitched, the full weight of the ultimatum pressing down on her. “She has given me until the next full moon to leave you and return to the forest.” Linnea finally looked up, her eyes swimming with tears, and delivered the final, devastating blow. “If I do not, she will destroy this place. She will tear down the walls, sour the well… she will cleanse it. And she can do it, Reverend Mother. I have seen her power. She can do it.” She finished, her voice a broken whisper, expecting the abbess to recoil in fear, to see the terrible logic of the situation: that Linnea, the source of the convent’s greatest miracle, was now the harbinger of its destruction. She offered herself as the only possible solution. "I have to go. It is the only way to keep you safe."

Reverend Mother Agnes listened, her face impassive, her ancient stillness an anchor in the swirling chaos of Linnea’s terror. She did not flinch. She did not cross herself. She simply absorbed the terrible facts, her gaze never leaving Linnea’s. When Linnea finished, offering her own exile as the only solution, the old abbess was silent for a long, heavy moment. She rose slowly from her chair and walked around the desk, stopping directly in front of the trembling girl. She did not look at Linnea with fear, or with pity, but with the resolute fierceness of a mother wolf defending her den. “No,” she said, her voice soft but imbued with the unshakeable strength of forged iron. She placed her old, dry hands on Linnea’s shoulders, her grip surprisingly firm. “You will not go. This is your home. You are a sister of this community, bound to us not by vows of blood, but by a shared trial of fire and ice and earth. We do not sacrifice our own to appease the darkness.” She looked past Linnea, towards the window that faced the forest, her eyes narrowing. “Your mother believes she is coming to tear down a house of timid women. She will find she has knocked on the door of a fortress. And its walls are not just stone. They are faith. And now,” she added, a grim, determined light entering her eyes, “they are you.”## Chapter 10

The word “No” landed in the quiet office with the force of a mountain falling into place. It was not a negation, but a foundation stone, a sudden, shocking declaration of unshakeable territory. Linnea, who had been braced for a sorrowful dismissal, for the pragmatic, painful choice of exiling one to save the many, felt the ground shift beneath her feet. Reverend Mother Agnes’s hands on her shoulders were not just a comfort; they were an anchor, holding her fast against the tide of her own terror. The words, *“We do not sacrifice our own,”* reverberated through her, silencing the screaming, ancestral instinct to flee. In that moment, she was not a dangerous liability, a half-breed creature bringing doom upon the innocent. She was one of them. The fierce, possessive love in that simple statement was a shield more real and more powerful than any glamour she had ever woven. The fear remained, a cold serpent coiled in her gut, but for the first time, it was not alone. It was met by a nascent, unfamiliar courage, a terrifying and exhilarating sense of belonging so absolute it was a kind of pain.

Reverend Mother Agnes guided her to the simple wooden chair opposite the desk, her expression now devoid of shock, replaced by a grim, focused practicality. This was no longer the mystic who had sanctioned a pagan healing; this was the abbess who managed budgets, negotiated with suppliers, and guided her community through every worldly and spiritual storm for forty years. She sat, folded her hands on the ledger, and fixed Linnea with a gaze that was both compassionate and demanding. “Faith is our shield, Linnea, but God does not ask us to stand in a field and be struck by lightning. He grants us wisdom and courage to seek shelter and to build a roof. This is a war, and I will not enter a battle ignorant of my enemy. You know her. You know her nature. You must teach me. Teach us. How do we fight a creature of the deep woods?”

Linnea struggled to find the words, to translate the raw, instinctual knowledge of her blood into a language the abbess could understand. It was like trying to describe the colour blue to a person born blind. “Her power is not like a sword,” she began, her voice low and hesitant. “It is like the air. It is strongest in her own lands, her domain. This place,” she gestured to the window, “is on the very edge of it. She can’t simply… strike it with lightning. Her magic is more subtle. It is a magic of life and decay. She can curdle milk with a glance, blight a field with a whisper. She can sing a sickness into your bones or a despair so deep you forget how to breathe. It works on the weak points, the cracks, the doubts. And it works on life. It persuades it. It seduces it into ruin.” She thought of the hunter’s dog, of stories her mother had told with a cruel smile. “It can persuade a heart to stop beating.”

The Reverend Mother listened, her face a mask of intense concentration, her mind working, translating, finding parallels. She nodded slowly, her fingers tracing the spine of a leather-bound book on her desk. “So, she is a spirit of corruption,” she murmured, her voice a low hum of dawning comprehension. “She finds the flaw and pours the poison in. She finds the doubt and nurtures it into despair. She finds the life and seduces it toward death. This is not a new enemy, child. This is the oldest enemy, wearing a different face. We have been fighting this battle since the Desert Fathers faced the demons in their caves.” She looked up, her eyes bright with a fierce, intellectual fire. “We fight despair with hope. We fight corruption with purity. We fight death with life. Her claim on this land is one of wild, selfish pride. We will meet it with a claim of consecrated service.”

A strategy, born of this strange union of theology and folklore, began to form in the small, lamplit room. The defense would be twofold. First, the spiritual. Reverend Mother Agnes would not reveal the true nature of the threat to the sisters – to do so would be to plant the very seeds of fear and doubt that the Huldra could exploit. Instead, she would announce a period of profound spiritual vigilance, a time of sustained prayer, fasting, and contemplation, calling it a “spiritual siege” against a darkness that sought to test their community. She would marshal the immense, focused power of their collective faith, turning the convent into a spiritual fortress, a beacon of hope so bright it would have no cracks for the despair to enter.

“And the second part of our defense,” the abbess said, turning her piercing gaze back to Linnea, “is you. You are her daughter. You carry her blood. But you have bent your power to healing, to nurturing. You will be our counter-measure. Your mother wants to blight this garden? You will make it an impossible fortress of consecrated life. Every prayer the sisters say in the chapel, you will translate into the soil. You will take their hope and feed it to the roots. You will make this small patch of earth so profoundly and defiantly holy, so full of sanctified life, that her power will find no purchase here. The roses were your trial. Now, they will be your sword and shield.” The weight of the responsibility was immense, but Linnea felt a strange sense of rightness settle over her. This was a purpose she could understand. It was not a denial of her nature, but its ultimate expression, forged into a weapon for the defense of her home.

As the plan solidified, a cold reality pricked at Linnea. She was strong, but she was one person, and her knowledge was limited, instinctual. She thought of her mother’s power of seduction, her ability to charm and beguile, a weapon primarily used on men. A thought sparked, and with it, a name. “There is one other,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “My brother. Aksel. He… he knows what I am. He helped you find me, that night. He is a man of science, but he understands this. He is immune to her… charms, because he knows the trick. He can help. He can see things I can’t.” Reverend Mother Agnes considered this for only a moment before giving a decisive nod. The rigid rules of her order, the strict separation from the outside world, had already been broken once in the service of life. They would be broken again. “In this war,” the abbess stated, her voice resonating with the conviction of a prophet, “we will accept all the allies God provides, no matter how they are clothed. Call your brother. Tell him the storm is coming.”

With a trembling hand, Linnea took the mobile phone the Reverend Mother retrieved from the locked drawer. The cold, smooth weight of it was a bizarre contrast to the ancient, elemental conflict they were facing. Finding Aksel’s name, she pressed the call button, her heart hammering against her ribs. He answered on the third ring, his voice groggy with sleep but warm with affection. “Lin? It’s the middle of the night. Is everything…?” He trailed off, sensing the frantic silence on her end. Taking a deep, ragged breath, Linnea spoke, the words feeling insane even as she said them. “Aksel. It’s Mom. She’s here.” She heard a sharp intake of breath on the other end, the sound of a man waking up instantly and completely. There was a pause, then his voice, stripped of all sleepiness, came back, low and grim. “I’ll be there at dawn.”Aksel arrived as the sky was turning from the deep, bruised purple of late night to the fragile, watery grey of dawn. This time, the gate was opened for him before he reached for the bell. Reverend Mother Agnes stood waiting in the archway, not as a desperate caregiver but as a fellow commander greeting a vital reinforcement. The air between them was charged with a grim, shared understanding. Last time, he had been an invading force of frantic love. Now, he was an invited ally, a specialist called to a war he was uniquely qualified to fight. He carried a large duffel bag, packed not for a single night’s emergency but for a protracted campaign. As he stepped into the silent courtyard, the city at his back, he felt the profound shift. The convent was no longer a sanctuary he was violating; it was a fortress he had come to help defend.

The three of them met in the abbess’s office, the same room where the truce had been forged. A pot of strong, black coffee, a concession to the secular world so profound it was almost shocking, sat on a small table beside the usual pitcher of water. Linnea was there, her face still pale, the shadows of terror still visible beneath her eyes, but the frantic panic had been replaced by a resolute, if fragile, calm. The Reverend Mother’s presence was a bulwark, and Aksel’s arrival was another stone in the wall. He listened without interruption as Linnea, in a low, steady voice, laid out the nature of the threat. She spoke of her mother not as a person, but as a force, a power inextricably tied to the land she claimed. She described the insidious nature of the magic: the way it didn't break things, but persuaded them to break themselves; the way it nurtured doubt into madness, sadness into suicidal despair; its particular affinity for sowing discord in unified groups and its contempt for all forms of human order.

Aksel, true to his nature, processed the mystical intelligence as a set of tactical problems. He paced the small room, his modern hiking boots a jarring sound on the old floorboards, his mind dissecting the threat. “So, she’s an agent of entropy,” he summarized, his scientific terminology a strange but effective translation. “She accelerates decay, exploits weaknesses, and uses psychological warfare. This isn’t about fireballs and lightning strikes. It’s about infiltration and corruption.” He stopped and looked at the two women, a plan already forming. “Reverend Mother, your strategy is sound. The spiritual fortification, the constant prayer—that strengthens the system against psychological attack. Linnea,” he turned to his sister, “you are the counter-agent to the decay. You are reinforcing the life-force of this place at its very roots. That leaves the physical.” He tapped a finger on the ancient stone of the window ledge. “Every fortress has vulnerabilities. Not just spiritual ones. I’ll be your engineer. I need to see everything. The well, the cisterns, the food stores, the foundations of the walls, the infirmary’s herb supply. If she can sour the milk, she can taint the water. If she can blight a field, she can rot the grain in your pantry. Let me find the cracks, physical and systemic. Let me find the weaknesses before she does.”

The convent, a place of quiet, contemplative routine, transformed into a bastion of focused, militant purpose. Following the morning service, Reverend Mother Agnes gathered all the sisters in the chapter house. She stood before them, a small, unyielding figure of black and white, and spoke of a time of great spiritual trial. She did not speak of Huldras or dark magic, but of a darkness that tests the resolve of communities, a spiritual siege that seeks to find entry through despair and discord. She called them not to fear, but to vigilance. She announced a period of sustained, unbroken prayer, creating a continuous chain of devotion that would run day and night. The chapel, she declared, would be the furnace of their fortress, and their faith would be the fire that kept the shadows at bay. The sisters, their faces solemn and resolved, accepted the charge not as a burden, but as a holy duty. An electrifying sense of shared purpose filled the room, transforming the quiet community into a disciplined army of the soul, their prayers becoming a constant, thrumming shield of spiritual energy.

For Linnea, the garden became her battleground. She moved through the rows of plants, no longer just a tender, but a conduit, a weaver of enchantments. The wave of prayer emanating from the chapel was a tangible force to her, a warm, golden hum in the air. She learned to gather it, to cup it in her mind and pour it into the earth. She mixed water from the baptismal font with the compost, whispered the names of the archangels over the seedbeds, and traced patterns of protection in the soil around the base of the well. Her work was a strange, hybrid liturgy, a fusion of her mother’s deep earth-magic and the convent’s soaring celestial faith. The garden responded, its vitality surging, the green of the leaves deepening, the scent of the blossoms becoming a defiant declaration of life. She was not just tending a garden; she was forging a living shield, a bastion of consecrated life so potent and so pure that her mother’s magic of decay would find nothing to corrupt, nothing to exploit.

The first few days of the siege were quiet, a tense, watchful peace. Aksel, given unprecedented access by the abbess, became a familiar, if strange, sight, his pragmatic presence a stark contrast to the robed figures he moved among. He tested the well water daily, inspected the stonework of the walls for new cracks, and checked the seals on the jars of preserves in the larder. The sisters, accepting him as part of the Reverend Mother’s mysterious plan, would nod to him quietly, their faces serene with prayer. The fortress was holding. But on the fourth day, the first probe came. A young novice, Sister Katerina, known for her cheerful disposition and sweet, wavering singing voice, broke down sobbing in the middle of Lauds, overcome by a sudden, inexplicable wave of despair, a conviction of her own unworthiness so profound she could not speak. At the same time, Aksel, inspecting the ancient pear tree on the west wall, found a line of black, viscous rot creeping up its trunk from the roots, a sickness that had not been there the day before. The events were small, isolated, and easily dismissed. But Linnea, standing in the centre of her vibrant garden, felt them as a pair of cold pinpricks on her soul. The enemy was at the gates, and she was testing the locks.
