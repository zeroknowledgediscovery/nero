The sweat on Rico’s brow was not from the heat alone. Dawn in Davao City was a heavy, wet blanket, smelling of diesel, overripe jackfruit, and the metallic tang of the coming rain. He sat cross-legged on the flat, gravel-dusted roof of his apartment block, a low-slung concrete building that seemed to sag in the middle like an old mattress. Before him, the silhouette of Mount Apo was a sleeping giant, its familiar peaks just beginning to separate themselves from the bruised purple of the pre-dawn sky. He breathed in, slowly, and the city breathed with him. Not the air, not exactly. It was something else. A hum. A current that ran beneath the rumble of the first jeepneys and the distant crowing of a rooster. It was the collective energy of a million sleeping, waking, dreaming souls, a river of life that he could dip his fingers into.

He called it the Current. He had no other name for it. When he was a boy, he thought everyone felt it, this invisible tide that ebbed and flowed with the moods of the city. He thought everyone knew, without looking, that the woman in the yellow dress at the corner was about to drop her bag of pandesal. He thought everyone could feel the sharp spike of panic from a block away as a motorcycle skidded on a patch of oil. He learned, slowly and sometimes painfully, that they could not. It was his alone, this strange sensitivity. It was his, and the tattered, moisture-swollen paperbacks he’d found at a stall in the Bankerohan Market, books filled with stories of knights and mystics who felt a similar ‘Force.’ Those stories gave him a code. A path. A way to make sense of the noise in his head. Be a guardian. Seek balance. Let the Current flow through you, but do not let it control you. He wasn't a knight, and he certainly didn't have a laser sword, but he was, in his own quiet way, a Jedi of Davao.

His meditation was broken by a different kind of hum, the whining buzz of a mosquito near his ear. He didn't swat it. He simply extended a sliver of his awareness, a gentle *suggestion* to the insect that the bougainvillea dangling from the neighbour's balcony was far more appealing. The mosquito whined once more, then veered away. A small thing. An invisible act in a world full of loud, visible struggles. He rose, his joints popping softly. The worn fabric of his grey t-shirt was already sticking to his back. It was time.

His 'armoury' was a small cart with a wobbly wheel and a large, colourful umbrella advertising a brand of soy sauce he didn't use. His 'weapon' was a deep wok, blackened by years of service. He was a vendor of kwek-kwek and tokneneng, the bright orange, battered quail and chicken eggs that were a staple of the city’s streets. It was a humble living, but an honest one. It placed him directly in the river of people, allowing him to observe and, when needed, to act in his small, quiet ways. He wheeled the cart down the three flights of stairs, the wobbly wheel—*thump-thump-thump*—announcing his descent. At the bottom, Lola Elara was sweeping the entryway with a *walis tingting*, her strokes rhythmic and sure. She was a tiny woman, her back bent into a permanent question mark, but her eyes were as sharp as the day she’d taken him in as a boy.

"You are late, *hijo*," she said, not looking up. "The Current was strong this morning."

She didn't know his name for it. She called it his *'damdam,'* his 'feeling.' She believed it was a gift from his mother, a way for her to watch over him from the great beyond. Rico smiled. "The city had much to say."

"The city is a gossip," she grumbled, but a small smile played on her lips. "Go on. Manny was already by, looking for you. He says he has news about your singing contest." She finally looked at him, her gaze softening. "Do not let it fill your head with clouds, Rico. Keep your feet on the ground. It is where the food is."

"Yes, Lola." He leaned down and kissed her papery cheek, smelling of soap and Tiger Balm.

He set up his cart at his usual spot near the entrance to a university, where the flow of students and office workers was constant. The air was thick with the smell of frying oil and the sweet-and-sour vinegar dip he mixed himself. Business was business. "Kwek-kwek, Ma'am, Sir! Bagong luto!" He worked with an easy, practiced grace. His hands moved in a blur, dipping eggs, sliding them into the hot oil, scooping them out at the precise moment they turned a perfect, crispy gold. He made it look easy. But he was also listening. He felt the flutter of anxiety from a student worried about an exam and gave him an extra egg for free. He sensed the weary sadness of a janitor and hummed a quiet, soothing tune as he handed him his change. He felt the subtle shift in the crowd just before a pickpocket tried to nudge a wallet from a woman's handbag, and Rico’s sudden, loud "Ouch!" as he ‘accidentally’ splashed a drop of hot oil near his own foot was enough to startle the thief and make him abort his attempt. No one ever noticed. He was just the kwek-kwek boy.

It was nearly noon when Manny’s tricycle, adorned with a chrome eagle and more lights than a Christmas tree, screeched to a halt beside the cart. Manny, broad-shouldered and with a grin that could charm the traffic police, hopped out.

"Rico, my man! The star of Davao!" Manny boomed, slapping him on the back hard enough to make the wobbly wheel shudder. "Any word? Did they call? Are you packing your bags for Manila yet?"

Rico shook his head, a faint smile on his face as he scooped a fresh batch of tokneneng into a paper cup. "Nothing yet, Manny. It’s only been two days since the last round. They said they would call."

"They will call! I'm telling you!" Manny leaned against the cart, grabbing a stick and spearing a kwek-kwek, dousing it in vinegar. "I heard you, brother. On that video call. When you sang that OPM classic... *hay nako*, even I almost cried. And I only cry when I get a flat tire in the middle of a downpour." He took a huge bite. "You have a gift. A golden throat."

Rico shrugged, his focus on a new customer. The gift Manny spoke of was the only one he felt comfortable sharing. His voice. When he sang, he didn't need to hide. He could pour all the emotion, all the sensitivity he felt from the Current, into the melody. He could connect with people in a way they understood, a way that didn't feel strange or unnatural. The X-Factor audition had been Manny's idea, a drunken dare after a long night. Rico had submitted a video on his borrowed phone, singing an old kundiman in his small, echoey room. He never, ever expected a call back. Then another. And another. Now, he was one of fifty contestants, nationwide, waiting for the call that would announce the final twelve. The Grand Finals, held live in Manila.

"You'll need a new suit," Manny continued, his mouth full. "And shoes. Not those slippers. You need to look like a star, Rico. First impressions are everything. We can go to Gaisano Mall later."

"I don't have money for a suit, Manny," Rico said quietly, handing change to a student.

"Don't worry about it! An investment! When you're a big shot, you can buy me a new tricycle. One with a sound system, eh?" Manny laughed, but then he grew serious. "Seriously, man. How are you fixed? For the trip? If you get in."

"They said they cover the flight and hotel for the finalists," Rico mumbled, not meeting his friend's eye. It was only a partial truth. They covered it from the moment you arrived for the production. Getting there was on you.

"Ah, good, good." Manny seemed satisfied. He didn't know the geography of Rico's finances, the vast, arid desert where his savings should be. Rico had just last week given the last of his emergency fund, a few thousand precious pesos, to his neighbour, Mrs. Santos. Her youngest had dengue, and the hospital was demanding a deposit. He'd felt the cold dread from their apartment, the father's quiet despair. He couldn't not help. A Jedi protects. He provides. That was the code. The money was just paper. The child's life was a flickering flame in the Current. There was no choice.

Manny finished his snack, paid with a crisp bill, and told Rico to keep the change. "For your suit fund," he said with a wink. "Call me the second you hear anything! I'll be your official motorcade to the airport!" He revved his engine, producing a deafening roar, and sped off into the chaotic traffic, leaving Rico in a cloud of two-stroke exhaust.

The rest of the day passed in a haze of heat and frying oil. He packed up as the sun began to set, the sky turning a brilliant, fiery orange. He wheeled his cart home, the wobbly wheel still thumping its familiar rhythm. The smell of adobo being cooked wafted from open doorways. He was tired. A deep, bone-weary exhaustion that came from standing all day and holding the city's emotions at bay.

He was washing the wok in the communal sink at the back of the building when it happened. A cheap cellphone, its screen spiderwebbed with cracks, rang from his pocket. The ringtone was a tinny, 8-bit version of a pop song. He almost didn't answer. It was an unknown number. A Manila area code.

His hands, slick with soap and water, fumbled with the phone. He finally swiped the screen. "Hello?"

"Is this Mr. Rico Sandoval?" a cheerful, professional voice asked. A woman's voice, crisp and clear, so different from the lilting cadence of Davao.

"Yes, this is Rico," he said, his heart starting to beat a little faster.

"Good evening, Rico! This is Jean from X-Factor Philippines! I have some wonderful news for you. The judges have made their final decision." There was a dramatic pause. Rico could feel the woman's manufactured excitement, a bright, shallow ripple in the Current. He held his breath. The dripping of the faucet next to him sounded like a drum. "Congratulations, Rico! You are one of our twelve Grand Finalists! We're flying you to Manila!"

For a moment, Rico couldn't speak. The world seemed to fall away. The grimy sink, the smell of burnt adobo, the distant sound of karaoke—it all vanished. In its place was a wave of pure, overwhelming light. A feeling so powerful, so joyous, it was almost painful. It surged through him, a tidal wave in the Current. On the small table beside the sink, a glass of water trembled, its surface vibrating as if from a silent earthquake. The delight was a physical force, a starburst behind his eyes. He had done it. His voice. His one, normal gift. It was enough.

"Rico? Are you still there?" the woman asked, her cheerfulness wavering slightly.

"Yes," he finally croaked, his voice thick with emotion. "Yes, I'm here. Thank you. Thank you so much."

"Of course! We are so excited to have you! Your voice is... well, it’s something special. Now, we'll be sending an email with the full itinerary, but the basics are this: you need to be at our studio in Quezon City for orientation in three days. That's this Friday, 10 AM sharp. Your hotel is booked from Thursday night. All the details will be in the email. We can't wait to see you, Rico! This is your big shot!"

He hung up the phone, his hand trembling. He leaned against the rough concrete wall for support, a huge, disbelieving grin spreading across his face. He was going to Manila. He was a finalist. The sounds of the neighbourhood came rushing back, but they sounded different now, like a symphony playing just for him. He laughed, a loud, barking sound of pure joy. Lola Elara's words came back to him. *Do not let it fill your head with clouds.* But his head was in the clouds, soaring high above Mount Apo, and it was the most wonderful feeling in the world. He pushed himself off the wall, ready to run upstairs and tell his lola, ready to call Manny and hear him scream.

Then the other words came back to him. *You need to be at our studio... in three days.* Three days. Davao to Manila. He couldn't just walk there. The email would have the details, but the woman's words were clear. He had to *get* to the studio. He thought of the new Inter-Mindanao-Luzon Maglev, the 'Iron Carabao' as the news called it. The fastest way to get to the capital now. A marvel of engineering that could get you there in half a day. It was also notoriously expensive.

A cold dread, slick and oily, began to seep into the warmth of his joy. It was a familiar feeling, the anxiety of an empty pocket. He walked back to his small, single room. It was sparse, containing only a thin mattress on the floor, a small wooden crate for a table, and a hook on the wall for his clothes. Tucked under the mattress was a small, biscuit tin decorated with faded pictures of the Royal Family. His bank. He pulled it out. The lid screeched in protest as he pried it open.

Inside lay a handful of coins and a single, crumpled twenty-peso bill. That was it. That was everything. The money he'd given to Mrs. Santos for her sick child stared back at him from the void where it used to be. The joy from the phone call, so bright and powerful just moments ago, curdled in his stomach. The flight was covered. The hotel was covered. But the first, most crucial step of the journey, the one that got him out of his own city, was a chasm he had no way of crossing. He stared at the pathetic collection of coins in the tin, the producer’s cheerful voice, *This is your big shot!*, echoing in the sudden, crushing silence of his room. The coins weren't enough for a decent meal, let alone a ticket on the Iron Carabao. The clouds he had been floating on dissipated, plunging him into a fall so fast it stole the air from his lungs.The silence in the room was a physical weight, pressing down on him, squeezing the air from his lungs. The Current, which had been a soaring wave of pure elation just moments before, now turned murky and cold. It lapped at him with the anxieties of the entire apartment block: the stress of unpaid bills from the family in 2B, the dull ache of arthritis from the old man in 1A, the simmering resentment of a couple fighting next door. Usually, he could filter it, keep it at a distance. But now, his own despair was a gaping wound, and all the city’s pain was pouring in. His code, his Jedi path, had taught him to be a guardian, to protect. But it had no chapter on what to do when the guardian himself was drowning. He had saved a child’s health but sacrificed his own future. Was this balance? It felt like punishment.

He stumbled out of his room, the biscuit tin still clutched in his hand like a useless anchor. He found Lola Elara in her own small space, separated from the corridor by a curtain of strung-together bottle caps. She was sitting in her favourite rocking chair, meticulously folding the laundry he had brought down earlier. She didn't look up as he approached, but the gentle rhythm of her rocking faltered for a second.

"The clouds came faster than I thought," she murmured, her voice soft. "Good news that carries a heavy stone is the worst kind."

Rico sank onto a low stool beside her, the defeat so heavy on his shoulders he could barely hold his head up. He opened his mouth to explain, but he only managed to extend the biscuit tin. She glanced at it, then up at his face, her dark eyes missing nothing. He told her everything—the phone call, the congratulations, the joy, and then the crushing reality of the empty tin and the three-day deadline. When he finished, she was silent for a long time, the only sound the creak of her rocking chair and the distant wail of a siren.

"My mother said a gift that asks for nothing in return is the only kind worth having," she said finally, her gaze distant. "Your gift, the *damdam*, it told you to help the child. Your other gift, your voice, it has given you this chance. They are fighting now, inside you." She reached into the bodice of her duster dress and pulled out a small, cloth-wrapped bundle. She unrolled it carefully on her lap, revealing a tight wad of bills. It was her pension, her savings. Her entire world in a few thousand pesos. "It is not enough for that Iron Carabao," she said, pushing it towards him. "But it is a start."

Tears pricked Rico's eyes, hot and sharp. He gently pushed her hand, and the money, back. "No, Lola. I can't. That's yours. It's for your medicine. For food." The thought of taking her security, after she had given him a home and a life, was unbearable. It went against every fibre of his being, against the very code he was struggling to uphold. "I will find a way."

"Being strong is not the same as being alone, *hijo*," she chided gently, but she folded the money and put it away. "Call your friend. The one with the loud machine. Pride is a stone that drowns a man faster than any river."

He knew she was right. Swallowing the lump of shame in his throat, he pulled out his phone and found Manny's number. It took three tries for his trembling finger to press the right spot on the cracked screen. Manny answered on the first ring, his voice already a party. "Brother! I felt it! A disturbance in the Force! Good news, right? Tell me it's good news!"

Rico took a deep breath, forcing a lightness he didn't feel into his voice. "They called, Manny. I'm in. I'm a finalist."

The explosion of sound on the other end of the line was so loud Rico had to pull the phone away from his ear. Manny was screaming with joy, a torrent of Tagalog and Cebuano superlatives. Rico could hear the sound of him banging on something, probably the dashboard of his tricycle. "I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU! THE JEDI OF DAVAO IS GOING TO MANILA! We're celebrating! I'll pick you up, we'll get some Red Horse, we'll sing karaoke until the sun comes up!"

"Manny, wait," Rico cut in, the words tasting like ash. "Manny, listen." The frantic energy on the other end of the line subsided, replaced by a cautious silence. "I got in. But I can't... I can't get there. I don't have the money for the ticket." He explained the situation quickly, clinically, leaving out the part about Mrs. Santos. He just said the money wasn't there. For a moment, there was only static. Rico's heart sank. Maybe this was it. The limit of friendship. The point where reality crashed the party for good.

Then Manny's voice came back, quiet and serious, all the boisterous energy gone. "How much?" Rico told him the estimated fare for the Maglev. Another pause. "Okay," Manny said, his voice firm. "Okay, *pre*. Don't you worry. Don't you even think about it. I'll handle it. You just practice your singing."

"Manny, that's too much," Rico protested. "I can't ask you for that. You have your own family to think about."

"Hey," Manny's voice was sharp. "Who was it that fixed my engine last month for nothing? Who talked my cousin out of joining that gang? Who sings my baby to sleep over the phone when she has a fever and I'm stuck in traffic? This isn't asking, Rico. This is... balancing. Your Jedi stuff, right? We're balancing." He was quiet for another second, and Rico could almost hear the gears turning in his head. "I have an idea. It's a little crazy. But it might just work. Meet me at the Toril gym tomorrow morning. The old one, by the market. Just be ready to sing." Before Rico could ask what he meant, Manny hung up, leaving him staring at the phone, a fragile, terrifying spark of hope igniting in his chest.The next morning, the pre-dawn sky was the colour of a healing bruise, and the air held the same oppressive humidity as the day before. But for Rico, the city felt entirely different. The familiar hum of the Current was still there, but his connection to it was frayed, his own anxieties creating a static that distorted the signal. Every rumble of a distant truck sounded like a judgment, every crow of a rooster a mockery of his stalled dream. He had barely slept, caught between the soaring vision of a Manila stage and the suffocating reality of an empty biscuit tin. Pride was a bitter meal, and he’d been chewing on it all night. He put on a clean, though faded, t-shirt and his worn-out slippers, the slap-slap of their soles on the concrete stairs a miserable counterpoint to the thumping of his own heart.

The Toril gym was not a place of polished chrome and air-conditioning. It was a cavernous, tin-roofed shed tucked behind the bustling wet market, and the air inside was a potent cocktail of sweat, cheap liniment, and rust. Sunlight struggled through a few grimy, high windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the thick air like tiny, frantic spirits. The symphony of the place was one of pure, grinding effort: the rhythmic *thwack-thwack-thwack* of leather gloves hitting heavy bags, the breathless hiss of a fighter shadowboxing, the sharp snap of jump ropes against the cracked concrete floor. It was a place where dreams were either forged in pain or beaten into the dust, and Rico felt deeply out of place. He was a vendor of fried eggs, not a purveyor of violence.

He found Manny near a makeshift ring in the centre of the room. He wasn't alone. He was speaking in rapid, animated Cebuano to a mountain of a man with a flat nose and ears like crumpled bits of pork rind. The man’s grey tank top was dark with sweat, and a towel was draped around his neck like a stole of office. This was Coach Berto, a local legend who had, in his youth, been a national boxing contender. His gaze, when it fell on Rico, was appraising and devoid of sentiment. Manny, by contrast, beamed, grabbing Rico's arm and pulling him closer. "Coach, this is him! This is Rico! The golden throat I told you about."

Coach Berto grunted, looking Rico up and down. "He looks like he sells fish balls." The statement was flat, a simple observation. "Manny says you need to get to Manila. Says you have a voice. He wants to make a collection. A *'Piso-Piso Para sa Pangarap'.'* A peso for a dream. Rico’s stomach plummeted. It was exactly as he’d feared: a charity drive. A public spectacle of his own failure. He felt the blood rush to his face, a hot tide of shame. This was the opposite of his way. His acts were meant to be invisible, ripples spreading from a stone no one saw him throw. Now, Manny and this grizzled coach were proposing to put him on a pedestal and beg for coins.

"Manny, no," Rico whispered, trying to pull his arm free. "I can't. It's not right." But Manny's grip was like iron. His usual jovial mask was gone, replaced by a fierce loyalty. "What's not right? Letting your one chance slip away because of pride? You think these guys," he gestured around the gym at the wiry, hardened men beating their ambitions into leather bags, "have never needed help? You think I've never needed help? We help each other, Rico. That's the rule here. That's our balance." Coach Berto folded his massive arms. "The boy is right, Manny. Pride is important. But," he turned his sharp eyes back to Rico, "honour is more important. It is not honourable to let your friend's faith in you go to waste. You will sing. Then we will see if your voice is worth a dream."

There was no room for argument. A moment later, Coach Berto climbed into the ring and clapped his hands, a sound like a gunshot that silenced the entire gym. Every head turned. Every pair of eyes, sharp and curious, landed on Rico. "Alright, you bums! Take a break! Water!" the coach barked. "We have a small intermission." He jerked his head, and Manny all but shoved Rico towards the ring. He stumbled through the ropes, his slippers feeling ridiculous on the stained canvas. He was in the centre of the square, the focus of two dozen sweat-streaked, battle-hardened men. Manny stood just outside the ropes, holding a dented, metal spit bucket. The humiliation was a physical taste in Rico’s mouth, metallic and sour.

Manny cleared his throat, assuming the role of a carnival barker. "My friends! My brothers! This is Rico. He sells the best kwek-kwek in Davao, but he also has a secret!" A few of the men snickered. "He has the voice of an angel who got into a fight with a devil and won! He has a chance, a big chance, to go to Manila and be a star on X-Factor! To show those city boys what a Davaoeno can do!" Manny’s voice swelled with passion. "But a dream costs money. Our brother needs a little help with the fare. So, he will sing for us, and if you like what you hear, if you believe in one of our own, you drop what you can into the bucket. For Davao! For Rico!"

Rico closed his eyes. He couldn't look at them. He couldn't see their pity or their ridicule. He was just the kwek-kwek boy. He was a joke. The silence stretched, thick and heavy. He thought of Lola Elara’s frail hand pushing her life savings toward him. He thought of Manny’s unwavering belief. He thought of the code. *Let the Current flow through you.* He had always interpreted it as a passive thing, a listening. But what if it meant more? What if it meant connecting, giving, and, in his moment of greatest need, receiving? He took a shaky breath. And then he sang.

He chose a song his mother used to hum, an old kundiman of longing and faraway hope. It started as a whisper, fragile and thin in the vast, smelly room. He didn’t think. He just opened a channel inside himself, the one he usually kept guarded, and poured everything into the melody. He poured in the shame of standing in that ring, the desperation of the empty biscuit tin, the agonizing hope from the phone call, the love for his lola, the deep, abiding gratitude for the friend holding the bucket. The Current swirled around him, no longer a confusing static but a symphony of shared struggle he could now conduct. He felt the boxer's exhaustion, the market vendor's worry over slow sales, the tricycle driver's fear of a breakdown. He took all of it, all their quiet pains, and wove them into the fabric of his song, giving them a voice.

The gym was utterly still. The snickers had long died. The men were frozen, some leaning on the ropes, others sitting on weight benches, their tough exteriors stripped away. The song wasn't just Rico's story anymore; it was theirs. It was the story of every dream that had to fight for air in the humid Davao heat. As the final, heartbreaking note faded into the rafters, a profound silence held the room. It was broken by a single, distinct *clink* as a coin hit the bottom of Manny's bucket. Then another. A boxer with a fresh cut over his eye walked up and dropped a crumpled twenty-peso bill inside. An old man who swept the floors shuffled forward and carefully added a few coins from a worn leather pouch. Soon, a line had formed. They weren't giving to a charity case. They were investing in a shared hope. They were paying respect.

When it was over, Manny climbed into the ring, his eyes shining. He didn't say a word. He simply placed the heavy bucket on the canvas. Coach Berto joined them, and the three of them knelt on the floor. They tipped the bucket over. Out spilled a small mountain of treasure: tarnished five- and ten-peso coins, a few precious one-hundred-peso bills, and a sea of crumpled twenties and fifties. It was the day’s earnings, lunch money, a piece of a hundred different lives. They counted it twice. Rico's hands shook as he stacked the coins. When the final tally was made, Manny let out a strangled sob that was half laugh, half cry, and pulled Rico into a crushing, sweaty hug. It was enough. It was just enough for a one-way ticket on the Iron Carabao, with a few hundred pesos to spare. Rico looked at the pile of money, the physical proof of the community's heart. The Current wasn't just a force he could feel; it was a force he could be a part of. Balance wasn't just about giving. It was about grace. The grace to stand with your brothers and allow yourself to be lifted.### Chapter 2

The walk home from the gym felt surreal. The heavy bucket, now empty, swung from Manny’s hand, but Rico could still feel the phantom weight of the coins and bills in his own pockets, pressed into a large, untidy roll. It wasn't just money; it was the sweat of a dozen boxers, the hope of a grizzled coach, the fierce, unshakeable loyalty of his best friend. Each peso was a small vote of confidence, a tiny spark in the Current that had converged to light his way. The shame he had felt in the ring had been burned away by the raw power of their collective belief, leaving behind a deep, humbling gratitude that settled in his bones. He had thought his path was one of solitary guardianship, of giving without being seen. He was beginning to understand that true balance wasn’t a one-way street. A river cannot only flow out; it must also be fed by its tributaries.

He found Lola Elara waiting on the steps of the apartment block, a small woven bayong bag at her feet. She had packed him a meal for the journey—rice, a piece of fried fish, and two hard-boiled eggs—and a small bottle of the Tiger Balm she used for her aches. "For the journey," she said, her voice gruff to hide its tremor. "Manila is a different kind of tired." He knelt before her, and she placed a wrinkled hand on his head, her touch a familiar anchor in the swirling tides of his emotions. "Do not forget the smell of the rain in Davao. Do not forget the taste of a good mango. Do not forget us. These things are your strength. Your voice comes from this soil, *hijo*. Do not let them plant it in a plastic pot." He promised he wouldn't, kissing her cheek and breathing in that comforting scent of soap and liniment one last time.

Manny’s send-off at the Maglev station was the exact opposite of Lola Elara’s quiet blessing. It was a spectacle. He insisted on driving Rico right up to the gleaming, futuristic entrance, his tricycle’s sound system blasting a tinny version of an 80s power ballad. "This is it, brother! The Iron Carabao!" Manny yelled over the music, his eyes wide with awe at the sleek, white terminal that looked more like an airport for spaceships than a train station. He pulled Rico into another bone-crushing hug. "Remember, you're not just singing for yourself. You're singing for all the kwek-kwek vendors, all the tricycle drivers, all the guys from the gym who gave you their lunch money! No pressure!" He grinned, then pressed a small, cold object into Rico's palm. It was a keychain, a miniature version of the chrome eagle that adorned his tricycle. "For good luck. So you don't forget your official motorcade."

The journey itself was a disembodying experience. As the Maglev train accelerated with a low hum, pulling away from the familiar green sprawl of Mindanao, Rico felt a strange sensation. The Current, the constant companion of his entire life, began to thin. The collective hum of Davao, with its specific notes of diesel, sea salt, and family, faded behind him. As the train shot across the long bridges spanning the Visayan seas, the psychic noise grew fainter and fainter until, for the first time he could remember, there was near-silence in his head. The absence of it was terrifying. He was adrift, untethered from the river of souls that had always defined his world. He was just Rico, alone in a comfortable, air-conditioned seat, with nothing but the anxious thrum of his own heart for company.

Then, hours later, as the train crossed the San Juanico Strait and began its inexorable northern trajectory across Luzon, a new Current slammed into him. It was not the deep, steady river he knew. This was a maelstrom. A chaotic, high-frequency scream of a billion minds all striving, competing, yearning, and screaming for attention. It was sharp, metallic, and utterly overwhelming. It was the smell of ambition burning like hot wires, the taste of desperation like sour concrete dust, the sound of a million lonely cries in a crowd of millions. This was Manila. The force of it made him physically recoil in his seat, his head throbbing. He had to consciously build a wall around his mind, a trick he hadn't needed to use with such intensity since he was a boy learning to cope with his sensitivity. He wrapped his senses in a protective shroud, dulling the input until it was a manageable, though still deeply unpleasant, roar.

Stepping out of the terminal in Quezon City was like diving into a turbulent sea. The heat was different, a dry, baked heat that rose from the pavement in shimmering waves. The noise was a physical assault of car horns, roaring engines, vendors’ cries, and the screech of the elevated railway system overhead. People moved with a clipped, frantic pace, their eyes fixed forward, their personal space an aggressive, defended territory. In Davao, he was the invisible kwek-kwek boy, a fixture of the landscape. Here, his invisibility was one of pure insignificance. He was just another body in the swarming, anonymous mass, buffeted by shoulders and ignored by a million passing glances.

He clutched the crumpled address of the hotel and navigated the chaotic maze of the city's transit system. The short journey felt like an epic trial, a descent into another level of reality. He was packed into an MRT train so tightly he could feel the nervous sweat of the man beside him and the tired sigh of the woman in front. The Current here was a suffocating blanket of anxieties—deadlines, rent, traffic, heartbreak—all layered on top of each other in a dense, pulsing miasma. He focused on the little chrome eagle in his pocket, its cheap metal cool against his skin, a tiny, tangible link to the world he had left behind.

The hotel was an oasis of artificial calm. The lobby was all polished marble, recessed lighting, and the hushed, floral scent of industrial air freshener. A handful of other young people were scattered around, some holding guitar cases, others pacing nervously while talking on expensive phones. Their energies, even muted by his mental shields, were bright, sharp, and competitive. Rico, in his worn-out t-shirt and slippers, felt every bit the country mouse. The woman at the front desk gave him a polite, practiced smile that didn't reach her eyes as she handed him his key card.

His room on the twelfth floor was bigger than his entire living space back home. It had a queen-sized bed with crisp white sheets, a flatscreen TV, and a bathroom with a shower that produced hot water instantly. It was the height of luxury, and it made him feel profoundly lonely. He went to the window and looked out. The city sprawled to the horizon, a glittering, endless circuit board of light and shadow. He could feel its monstrous, chaotic heartbeat through the thick glass. Back home, Lola Elara would be sweeping the entryway. Manny would be washing his tricycle, arguing about basketball with the other drivers. The Current there was a family, squabbling and messy, but a family nonetheless. This place, for all its glamour, felt like a beautiful, empty cage.

Later that evening, there was a mandatory welcome dinner in a small hotel banquet room. Rico found a spot at a table in the corner, hoping to remain a quiet observer. He nursed a glass of iced tea, watching the other contestants. They were a dazzling, intimidating bunch. A girl with impossibly perfect hair and a designer dress was holding court, recounting her time training at a music academy in New York. Rico felt her Current; it was like a perfectly cut diamond, brilliant, hard, and utterly self-contained. Her name was Cassandra, and she radiated a confidence so absolute it was practically a force field.

He was so focused on not being noticed that he didn't see the young man who sat down opposite him until he spoke. "Long way from home, huh?" The guy had a friendly, open face and was wrestling with a plate piled high with lechon. He gestured with his fork. "I can always tell. We're the ones who are amazed by the buffet." He grinned. "Leo. From Iloilo." His energy felt like a warm, steady breeze, a welcome respite from the sharp-edged ambitions filling the room. Rico felt his own shoulders relax a fraction. "Rico. From Davao."

"Davao! Nice! I love your durian," Leo said, his mouth full. "Man, this is all a bit much, isn't it? I've been singing at fiestas and town gatherings my whole life, but this..." he waved his fork around the room, "this feels like trying to sing in the middle of a typhoon." He leaned forward conspiratorially. "You see that girl, Cassandra? I heard her dad owns a record label. And the guy she's talking to, the one with the leather jacket? He's already a YouTube star. Kind of makes you feel like you brought a slingshot to a gunfight, eh?" Rico could only nod, the small pile of coins from the Toril gym feeling a million miles away. His gift, his voice, had felt so large in Davao. Here, in this room shimmering with polished talent and powerful connections, it felt very, very small.### Chapter 3

The next morning, the reality of the competition began in earnest. The twelve finalists were herded by chipper production assistants into a black van with tinted windows, a hermetically sealed bubble that ferried them through the snarled traffic to the network's broadcast complex. The studio itself was a shock to the system. After the oppressive heat outside, the air inside was chilled to a near-arctic temperature. It was a vast, dark cavern, dominated by a brightly lit stage that seemed to float in the darkness, surrounded by the skeletal silhouettes of cameras on cranes, miles of thick black cables coiling like pythons, and a dizzying grid of lights hanging from the high ceiling. It was a place built for artifice, designed to capture and broadcast dreams while having none of its own.

The contestants were arranged on a set of risers facing the stage, a nervous flock huddled together for warmth. Rico found a spot on the back row, next to Leo, who was nervously tapping his knee. "Feels like we're about to be interrogated," Leo whispered, his friendly face pale under the harsh lighting. Rico just nodded, trying to fortify the walls in his mind. The Current in this room was a nauseating blend of ambition, terror, and desperate hope, all amplified by the cold, sterile environment. It was a far cry from the honest sweat of the Toril gym.

Three figures emerged from the shadows and took their seats at a long, glowing table on the stage. The host, a man with teeth so white they seemed to generate their own light, introduced them. First was Isabel Reyes, the reigning "Pop Diva," a stunning woman in a sharp power suit whose public persona was fierce and uncompromising. Rico felt a different story from her, though; beneath the polished, hard-candy shell was a deep well of exhaustion and a surprising loneliness. Next was Maestro Ryan, a legendary OPM balladeer from a bygone era, a man whose songs were woven into the very fabric of Filipino culture. His energy was calm and deep, like a placid lake, but with a powerful, discerning current running beneath it. He saw everything.

The final judge, and the one who held the most power, was Mr. Vic, the head producer. He was a small, unassuming man in a simple black shirt, but his presence dominated the room. His Current was a flat, unreadable hum, like a machine that was constantly calculating, assessing, and judging. There was no sentimentality in him, only a cold, sharp focus on what would sell. He was the one who spoke first, his voice quiet but carrying an authority that cut through the nervous chatter. "Welcome to X-Factor," he said, his eyes sweeping over them, making each of them feel individually dissected. "Let's be clear. We are not here to find a good singer. Good singers are a dime a dozen. We are here to find a star. A product. A complete package that we can sell to the country, and maybe, to the world. Your journey to becoming that product starts now."

The friendly host stepped forward again. "That's right, Mr. Vic! And to see what raw materials we're working with, we're going to start with a little surprise vocal assessment! No band, no backing track. Just you, a microphone, and sixty seconds to prove you belong here." A wave of panic, sharp and cold, washed through the contestants. Rico felt it as a physical blow, a collective gasp in the Current. He saw Cassandra, the girl with the record-label father, merely arch an eyebrow, her confidence unshaken. Others were not so composed. A young man in front of Rico began to sweat profusely, his hands trembling.

They went in alphabetical order. Cassandra was third. She strode to the center of the stage with an easy, practiced confidence, as if she owned it already. She sang a complex, soaring ballad from a Broadway musical, her voice a technical marvel. Every note was perfect, every run precise, every dynamic shift flawlessly executed. It was a breathtaking display of skill. But as Rico listened, not with his ears but with his other sense, the performance felt like a stunningly intricate ice sculpture: beautiful, impressive, but utterly cold. It was a performance designed to impress, not to connect. The judges nodded in approval, Mr. Vic making a small, neat note on a pad before him.

One by one, they sang. Some were good but nervous, their voices trembling. Others were overly theatrical, trying too hard to fill the space and falling short. The pressure was immense, and the cold, silent judgment from the panel was withering. As the names got closer to 'S', Rico’s heart began to pound a frantic rhythm against his ribs. The Manila Current, which he had been trying so hard to block out, was seeping through the cracks in his defences. It was a cacophony of fear and judgment. He felt the sting of another contestant's cracking voice, the hot flush of their embarrassment. His instinct was to retreat, to sing something safe, to try and copy Cassandra's polished perfection. The code felt distant and naive. *Seek balance.* What balance was there in a shark tank?

"Sandoval, Rico." Mr. Vic's voice was flat, emotionless. Leo gave his arm a supportive squeeze. "You got this, man. Just sing." Rico walked towards the stage, his worn-out slippers feeling shabby and loud on the polished floor. The single spotlight was blinding, turning the rest of the studio into an inky void. He felt utterly alone, a tiny boat in a vast, stormy ocean. He stood before the microphone, his hands clammy. He could feel the judges' expectant silence, the network of cameras watching him like unblinking eyes. He opened his mouth, but no sound came out. The chaos in his head was too loud.

He closed his eyes, desperate. He couldn't find Davao. He couldn't find Lola Elara's kitchen or Manny's roaring tricycle. They were too far away. There was only this place, this cold, screaming void. *Let the Current flow through you.* The words of his code came to him then, not as a gentle mantra, but as a desperate command. If he couldn't block the chaos, what if he embraced it? What if he gave it a voice? He stopped fighting. He let the walls down. The full, terrifying force of the Manila Current crashed into him: the judges' critical weariness, the other contestants' frantic jealousy and fear, the city's relentless, grinding loneliness that echoed even in this isolated room. It was a painful, dissonant chord, but it was a chord nonetheless.

He took a breath and began to sing the same kundiman he had sung in the gym. But this time, it was different. The melody that had once spoken of gentle, provincial longing now carried a new weight. It was filled with the quiet desperation of the boy sweating in the front row, the aching loneliness of the pop diva on the panel, the hollow echo in the heart of the great, glittering city outside. He didn't perform the song; he surrendered to it. His voice, unpolished and raw, cracked with an emotion that wasn't entirely his own. It was the collective voice of the lost and the striving, a fragile prayer whispered in the heart of a storm.

When he finished, the silence in the studio was different from the silence that had followed the other performances. It wasn't empty. It was heavy, ringing with the ghost of the final note. Rico opened his eyes. Maestro Ryan was leaning forward, his expression one of deep, undisguised fascination. Isabel Reyes, the pop diva, had a strange, vulnerable look on her face, her mask of fierceness momentarily forgotten. Even Mr. Vic wasn't writing. He was just looking at Rico, his head tilted, his cold, calculating eyes holding a flicker of something Rico couldn't decipher—not approval, exactly, but intense, analytical curiosity. At the back, Leo gave him a slow, wide-eyed nod. Cassandra, however, was glaring, her perfect composure ruffled, as if he had broken some unspoken rule of the game. Rico’s heart was still hammering, but for the first time since arriving in Manila, he felt his feet on the ground. He hadn't just survived the first test. He had found a new way to use his gift.The silence that followed was a living thing, thick with unspoken thoughts. It was finally Maestro Ryan who broke it, his voice a low, resonant hum that seemed to calm the very air. He leaned forward, his elbows on the glowing table, his steepled fingers hiding his mouth but not the intensity in his eyes. “There are many singers in this world, *hijo*. They can hit the notes. They can follow the melody. But very few can sing the spaces between the notes. The silences. The hesitations. You sang the *kaluluwa*—the soul—of that song. I have not heard that in a very long time.” His words were a balm, a deep and resonant chord in the Current that momentarily soothed Rico's frayed nerves.

Isabel Reyes spoke next, her sharp, diva persona softened by a look of profound melancholy. She tapped a long, manicured finger on the table, a stark contrast to the Maestro's gentle tone. “What he said is true. And it’s dangerous. That feeling you gave us, that raw, unprotected emotion… this industry is a machine that exists to sand that down, to polish it until it’s shiny and unrecognizable. They will call it ‘potential’ and try to package it. They will try to take that from you because it’s unpredictable, and they hate anything they can’t control.” She met his gaze, and for a fleeting moment, Rico felt a powerful surge of her own past, a ghost of a younger, more vulnerable artist before the armor went up. "Be careful," she added, her voice dropping to a near whisper. "It's the most valuable thing you have."

Then came Mr. Vic. He had remained perfectly still, his face an impassive mask. When he spoke, his voice was cool and clinical, stripping away the warmth of the other judges’ comments. “Technically, you were a mess. Your breath control was inconsistent. Your phrasing was indulgent. You were, to put it bluntly, emotionally incontinent.” Each word was a precise, painful jab. Rico flinched. “But,” Mr. Vic continued, holding up a single finger, “it was also the only performance today that made me stop writing. Not because it was good, but because it was interesting.” He leaned back, his eyes narrowing. "Emotion is a commodity, Mr. Sandoval. People pay for it every day—in movies, in music, in the dramas they follow. Right now, your particular brand is spilling all over the floor. It's raw, it's potent, and it’s completely unpackaged. Your task, should you remain in this competition, is to learn how to bottle it. To put a label on it. We're not running a therapy session here. We are making a product." The word 'product' hung in the cold air, chilling Rico to the bone.

Rico walked off the stage in a daze, the judges' conflicting words ringing in his ears. He was raw material. A commodity. An interesting mess. Leo was there to meet him at the bottom of the steps, grabbing his shoulder with an exuberant shake. "Dude! What was that? You made the Pop Diva cry! I think you even made Mr. Vic's robot brain short-circuit for a second!" But his voice was drowned out by the glare he received from across the room. Cassandra stood with her arms crossed, her perfect face a mask of cold fury. She hadn't cried. She looked at Rico not as a fellow artist, but as someone who had cheated, who had played a different game with different rules and somehow scored points. The Current coming off her was frigid with indignation.

The contestants were reassembled on the risers, the atmosphere now thick with a new tension. Rico's performance had redrawn the battle lines. It was no longer just a singing contest; it was a clash of philosophies. The host returned to the stage, his bright smile unwavering. "Incredible! What a start to the competition! Now, it's time for your first official challenge. The theme for this week is… Modern Pop Hits!" A screen behind him lit up with the logos and album art of the country's biggest pop stars. "We want to see how you handle the music of today! We want to see versatility! We want to see you connect with millions of fans! Your song assignments are being sent to your tablets now."

A chorus of groans and excited gasps went through the group. Rico fumbled with the sleek tablet he'd been issued, a device that felt alien in his hands. He opened the message and his heart sank. His assigned song was "Neon Pulse" by a hugely popular teen artist known for heavily autotuned vocals and songs about clubbing and fleeting summer romances. It was the exact opposite of everything he was. It was a song born not from soil and struggle, but from a synthesizer and a marketing meeting.

Back in the sterile silence of his hotel room, Rico put on a pair of headphones and played the track. A pounding, synthetic bass line exploded in his ears, followed by a high-pitched, digitally processed voice singing vapid lyrics about dancing until dawn under laser lights. He listened to it once, then twice, trying to find a way in. He tried to use his gift, to dip his fingers into the song's Current, but there was nothing there. It was a smooth, impenetrable surface of manufactured energy. There was no river, no soul, no story. It was just noise.

He looked out the window at the endless, glittering expanse of Manila. The chaotic roar of the city's Current felt more comforting than the empty perfection of the song in his ears. He had just discovered he could channel the city's pain and longing, but how could he possibly channel this? Mr. Vic’s words echoed in his head: *Bottle it. Label it. Make a product.* He felt a wave of despair. Perhaps he had been a fool to think he belonged here. He was a Jedi of the kwek-kwek cart, a guardian of small, quiet truths. This world of neon pulses and plastic emotions was a foreign galaxy, and he was beginning to think he didn't have the ship to navigate it.### Chapter 4

For two days, Rico lived inside a prison of synthetic sound. The pounding beat and saccharine lyrics of "Neon Pulse" were a constant, mocking loop in his head. He tried to follow the advice of the show's assigned vocal coach, a brisk, perpetually smiling woman named Ms. Anya, who insisted the key was "energy" and "performance value." In a small, mirror-walled practice room, she had him trying to dance, to pump his fist in the air, to plaster a wide, vacant smile on his face while he sang. The result was a grotesque parody. His body, attuned to the slow, deliberate grace of a street vendor, moved with a clumsy, apologetic stiffness. His voice, which knew how to carry the weight of sorrow and hope, sounded hollow and false when forced into a mould of manufactured joy. He felt like a bird being taught to bark.

"No, no, no!" Ms. Anya said, her smile finally cracking with exasperation after one particularly painful attempt. She stopped the backing track with a sharp jab of her finger. "Rico, the song is called 'Neon Pulse,' not 'Distant Funeral Dirge.' It's about fun! Parties! Youth! Don't you remember being young and having fun?"

Rico just stared at his reflection in the mirror—a tired, anxious man in a borrowed t-shirt who looked profoundly out of place. His youth had been spent listening to the city's moods, helping Lola Elara, and learning to build walls around his own head. Fun had been a stolen hour of reading a tattered paperback on the roof, not dancing under laser lights. "I'm trying," he said, the words tasting like a lie. Ms. Anya sighed, tapping her pen against her clipboard. "Look, your audition was... unique. But this is the real world. This is the music business. People want to feel good. They want to escape. They don't want to be reminded of their problems by a pop song. You need to decide if you can give the audience what they want, or if you're just a one-trick pony." The phrase, so similar to Mr. Vic’s assessment, struck him like a physical slap. A one-trick pony. An interesting mess.

That evening, he broke. He couldn't stand the sterile, air-conditioned silence of his room, haunted by the ghost of the song he couldn't sing. He fled the hotel, needing to feel the city's chaotic, unfiltered breath on his skin. He walked without direction, letting the currents of the crowd pull him along until he found himself standing at the entrance to a sprawling, multi-level mall. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of popcorn and perfume, a shrine to the very consumerism Mr. Vic had spoken of. He found a seat on a bench in a crowded atrium, a central hub where people flowed past in an endless stream, and for the first time, he let his mental shields down completely, not to sing, but simply to listen.

The Current here was a dazzling, deafening roar. He focused on the young people, the demographic "Neon Pulse" was written for. He saw them in groups, laughing loudly, their faces illuminated by the screens of their phones as they framed the perfect selfie. He felt the bright, sharp spikes of their performed happiness, an energy curated for public consumption. But beneath that glittering surface, he felt the undertow. He sensed the gnawing anxiety of a teenage girl, whose laughter was just a little too shrill, terrified that her friends would leave her behind. He felt the dull, throbbing loneliness of a young man sitting with a circle of acquaintances, scrolling endlessly through his phone, disconnected from the very people he was with. He felt their collective, unspoken yearning—a desperate hunger for genuine connection in a world of filtered realities and fleeting attention spans.

He watched as a group of them passed by, a portable speaker in someone’s bag blasting a song with the same frantic, empty beat as "Neon Pulse." They were dancing, but their movements were for the benefit of their phone cameras, their eyes constantly checking their own reflections in the mall’s polished surfaces. And then, Rico understood. The song wasn't the problem. It was a symptom. He had been trying to find a soul within the song itself, but its soul wasn't there. It was in them. The song was a vessel, an empty, brightly-coloured cup. The kids filled it with their own desperate need to feel alive, to feel seen, to dance away the fear that they were fundamentally alone. The lyrics about dancing until dawn weren't a celebration of joy; they were a frantic attempt to outrun the silence.

A new path opened up in his mind, a way to honour his code within the confines of the challenge. He wouldn’t sing the song as it was written. He wouldn’t perform its shallow happiness. He would sing the truth *beneath* it. He would sing for the lonely girl with the shrill laugh. He would sing for the boy lost in the blue light of his phone. He would take their unspoken feelings, their hidden heartaches, and pour them into the empty vessel of the song. He wouldn't be a product, but a translator. A guardian, even here, in this temple of artifice.

He practically ran back to the hotel, a fire lit in his chest. He found an empty music room, a small, soundproofed cube with a piano and an old, forgotten acoustic guitar propped in the corner. He picked up the guitar. The wood felt real and solid in his hands, an anchor to the earth. He ignored the official backing track and began to pick out the melody of "Neon Pulse" on the strings. He slowed it down, stripping away the frantic electronic beat. Hidden beneath the major-key bombast, he found a simple, almost mournful chord progression. The lyrics, when sung slowly, with intention, transformed. "Gotta find that neon pulse, feel it in my veins" became a desperate search for a sign of life. "Dancing with a stranger's silhouette 'til the sun's in the sky" turned into a haunting image of fleeting, anonymous connection.

He played and sang for hours, his voice no longer hollow, but filled with the empathy he’d felt at the mall. He wasn’t performing anymore. He was testifying. He poured the city’s quiet desperation into the melody, transforming the disposable pop hit into a heartfelt, acoustic lament. He was so lost in the music that he didn't notice the door to the music room creak open. Ms. Anya stood in the doorway, her clipboard held loosely at her side, her perpetually energetic expression replaced by one of utter bewilderment. She listened for a full minute, her head tilted. He was breaking every rule she had tried to teach him. He was ignoring the tempo, the arrangement, the entire commercial intent of the song. But the sound he was making was undeniable. It was raw, magnetic, and achingly beautiful. Without a word, she backed out of the room and quietly closed the door, leaving him alone with his newfound truth.

On the night of the live show, the backstage area was a vortex of organized chaos. Production assistants with headsets buzzed around like frantic insects. The other contestants were in various states of readiness—some paced in circles muttering lyrics, others had their makeup retouched under harsh lights. Leo was sweating through his stylish jacket, practicing his power notes under his breath. Cassandra was a portrait of icy calm, stretching her neck like a ballerina, completely in her element. Rico sat quietly on a crate in a dark corner, away from the frenzy. He wasn't nervous. Not in the way he had been. The terror had been replaced by a quiet, resolute calm. He knew what he had to do. He held the small, chrome eagle keychain Manny had given him, its sharp edges pressing into his palm, a reminder of the gym, the bucket of coins, and the realness of the world he came from. He wasn't singing for the judges anymore. He wasn't even singing for a record deal. He was singing for the kid in the mall. He was singing to let them know that he could feel their quiet struggle, that even in the heart of the machine, a human pulse could still be found. When the stage manager called his name, he rose to his feet, took a deep breath, and walked toward the light.### Chapter 5

As Rico stepped from the shadowy wings onto the stage, the world dissolved into a roaring inferno of light and sound. The heat from the spotlights was a physical weight, and the sound of the live audience, a wild, faceless beast, slammed into him. It was a chaotic tidal wave of excitement, boredom, anticipation, and a thousand other fleeting emotions. In the past, this sensory assault would have crippled him. But tonight, he was an island of calm in his own storm. He ignored the main microphone at the center of the stage, a lonely silver stalk in a pool of light, and walked deliberately to the side, where a single wooden stool and an acoustic guitar waited for him, just as he had requested. The small act of defiance sent a ripple of confusion through the audience and, he could feel, through the judges' table. He could sense the host's momentary panic, the silent, questioning exchange between the judges, and the sharp, focused stillness from Mr. Vic, who recognized a deviation from the plan.

He settled onto the stool, the familiar shape of the guitar a comfort against his body. He didn't look at the judges or the roaring crowd. He looked inward, reaching for that quiet place he had found in the mall, that shared space of hidden loneliness. He took a single, slow breath, letting the roaring Current of the live studio wash over him without letting it inside. He was not here to be buffeted by it. He was here to give it a voice. His fingers found the strings, and he played the first chord. The sound, clean and unadorned, cut through the electric hum of the studio with shocking clarity. It was a sound of wood and steel, of earth and air, in a world of plastic and electricity. The restless beast of the audience, surprised by this sudden intimacy, began to quiet, its roar subsiding into a curious murmur, then a hush.

Then he sang. The opening line, "Gotta find that neon pulse," came out not as a boast, but as a whispered confession. His voice, stripped of all artifice, carried the raw texture of his own doubt and the city's quiet ache. He wasn't performing the song; he was excavating it, peeling back its glossy, factory-made layers to reveal the fragile, beating heart of longing he knew was hidden inside. The Current was his guide. He felt the waves of emotion rolling off the thousands of people in the darkness and wove them into his song. The desperate need to be noticed, the fear of being forgotten, the hollow feeling of standing in a crowded room and feeling utterly alone—he channeled it all into the simple, mournful melody he had created. He was a translator, turning the audience's own secret language back on them in a way they could finally understand.

The camera zoomed in on the judges' faces. Maestro Ryan had taken off his glasses and was rubbing his eyes, not in weariness, but as if to clear his vision and be certain of what he was hearing. Isabel Reyes sat rigid, her hands clasped tightly on the table, her mask of cold professionalism completely gone. A single tear traced a shimmering path through her perfect makeup. It was Mr. Vic, however, who was the most arresting sight. He was leaning so far forward he was almost out of his chair, his pen forgotten. His face, usually a blank slate of commercial calculation, was a mask of intense, almost predatory, concentration. He wasn't watching a contestant; he was witnessing an anomaly, a variable he had not accounted for, and his mind was furiously working to categorize, to understand, to see how this raw, powerful force could possibly be contained and monetized. In the audience, the sea of glowing phone screens was motionless. A close-up on the main monitor showed a teenage girl, her face painted with glitter, tears streaming down her cheeks, her mouth half-open in stunned recognition.

Rico built the song to its quiet, devastating climax. The final lines, "Dancing with a stranger's silhouette 'til the sun's in the sky," were delivered with a fragile, breaking vulnerability that spoke of a thousand lonely dawns. He let the last chord of the guitar ring out, its vibration hanging in the vast, silent space like a soul taking flight. He had given them everything. The raw truth of his gift, the empathy born from his strange sensitivity, the sound of a city's lonely heart beating in the dark.

For three full seconds after the last note faded, there was absolute silence. It was a silence so profound it was louder than the applause had been for any other contestant. It was a shared, sacred moment where a thousand strangers were united in a single, gut-wrenching feeling. The spell was broken by a single, choked sob from someone in the front row, and then the studio erupted. It was not the polite, rhythmic clapping of an impressed audience. It was a wild, cathartic roar, a wave of pure, unrestrained emotion crashing onto the stage. People were on their feet, screaming, crying, applauding not just with their hands but with their whole bodies. Rico remained on the stool, blinking against the sudden glare of the house lights, his hand still resting on the guitar. He had stepped onto the stage as the kwek-kwek boy from Davao. In the deafening, emotional storm that now swirled around him, he had no idea what he had just become.As Rico stepped from the shadowy wings onto the stage, the world dissolved into a roaring inferno of light and sound.

The raw truth of his gift, the empathy born from his strange sensitivity, the sound of a city's lonely heart beating in the dark.

For three full seconds after the last note faded, there was absolute silence. It was a silence so profound it was louder than the applause had been for any other contestant. It was a shared, sacred moment where a thousand strangers were united in a single, gut-wrenching feeling. The spell was broken by a single, choked sob from someone in the front row, and then the studio erupted. It was not the polite, rhythmic clapping of an impressed audience. It was a wild, cathartic roar, a wave of pure, unrestrained emotion crashing onto the stage. People were on their feet, screaming, crying, applauding not just with their hands but with their whole bodies. Rico remained on the stool, blinking against the sudden glare of the house lights, his hand still resting on the guitar. He had stepped onto the stage as the kwek-kwek boy from Davao. In the deafening, emotional storm that now swirled around him, he had no idea what he had just become.The host, a man trained to fill any silence with cheerful patter, was momentarily struck dumb. He stood blinking in the glare, his cue cards forgotten, as the wave of raw, human sound washed over him. When he finally found his voice, it was a reedy, inadequate thing against the tidal wave of emotion. "Wow! Just... wow! Let's... let's hear what the judges have to say! Maestro?" He gestured towards the panel, a desperate appeal for order in the beautiful chaos Rico had unleashed.

Maestro Ryan looked up, and it was clear he was still somewhere else, lost in the echoes of the song. He slowly pushed his chair back from the table as if to get a better view of Rico, not as a contestant, but as a phenomenon. "What can one say?" he began, his voice thick. "We ask for singers, and sometimes we are blessed with artists. But tonight... tonight, we were visited by a storyteller. You did not sing a song, Rico. You took a hollow vessel and you filled it with the truth. The truth of a thousand lonely nights in this city. The truth of a generation that is more connected and more alone than any before it. That was not a performance. That was a testimony."

Isabel Reyes dabbed at the corner of her eye with a shaking finger, smearing her perfect eyeliner. Her voice, when she spoke, had lost its brittle, pop-diva edge and was filled with a fierce, protective urgency. "Maestro is right," she said, her gaze locked on Rico. "And I need you to listen to me very carefully. What you just did… that thing that allows you to connect like that… it is a rare and fragile gift. This business," she gestured around the glittering studio, "is designed to destroy it. They will try to replicate this moment. They will give you formulas. They will tell you to 'bottle' it. They will try to sand away every rough edge that makes you real until you are as smooth and empty as the song you were supposed to sing. Do not let them. Fight for that truth with everything you have."

Then it was Mr. Vic's turn. The thunderous applause had finally begun to subside, but a palpable energy still hummed in the air. He had not clapped. He simply stared at Rico, his face a complex puzzle of analysis. "Let us be clear about what happened here," he said, his voice cutting through the remaining emotion with chilling precision. "The assignment was to sing a modern pop hit. You failed. The assignment was to show commercial appeal within an established genre. You failed. You disregarded the arrangement, the tempo, and the entire artistic and commercial intent of the original product." He paused, letting the weight of his clinical indictment settle. "However," he continued, his tone shifting from prosecutorial to predatory, "you also managed to create a moment of mass emotional catharsis so powerful that I suspect it will be the most replayed clip in the history of this show. You didn't give them a product they wanted. You created a need they didn't know they had and then sold them the cure. From a marketing perspective, that is not failure. That is genius. And it is terrifyingly valuable."

Rico walked off the stage in a fugue state, the roar of the crowd and the judges' conflicting verdicts swirling into a disorienting vortex in his head. The warmth of the Maestro's praise, the fierce urgency of Isabel's warning, and the cold, commercial appraisal of Mr. Vic were three powerful, opposing currents pulling him in different directions. He clutched the neck of the guitar like a piece of driftwood in a storm. Backstage was pandemonium. Production assistants were scrambling, their usual clockwork efficiency shattered. They looked at him with a mixture of awe and fear, as if he were a wild animal that had somehow wandered onto their carefully managed set.

Leo was the first to reach him, his eyes wide with disbelief. He grabbed Rico by the shoulders, his own performance completely forgotten. "Brother, what was that?" he gasped, his voice a mixture of laughter and reverence. "That wasn't a song! That was a sermon! You made people cry singing 'Neon Pulse'! I saw a guy in a security uniform wiping his eyes! Do you understand what you just did?" Before Rico could answer, a cold, sharp voice cut through Leo's excited babble.

"It was a disgrace." Cassandra stood before them, her arms crossed, her face a mask of furious contempt. Her own flawless, powerful performance earlier in the night now felt like a distant, irrelevant memory, and the Current rolling off her was glacial. "You spat on the art form. Music is about skill, about years of training and discipline, about respecting the composer. It is not some cheap therapy session where you bleed your feelings all over the stage for applause. You didn't sing; you manipulated them. It was pathetic."

Leo bristled, stepping forward. "Pathetic? He was the only one here who was real!"

"Real?" Cassandra laughed, a short, ugly sound. "That wasn't real. That was a calculated, sentimental trick. He's no artist. He's a faith healer." She gave Rico one last look of utter disgust before turning on her heel and stalking away, a queen whose castle had been invaded by a peasant who didn't even have the decency to follow the rules of her court.

Rico was left standing in the chaotic corridor, the sound of the crowd still faintly audible. Leo's fervent praise, Cassandra's acidic scorn, and the judges' clashing perspectives spun in his mind. He sank onto a nearby equipment case, the heavy silence of his own thoughts finally louder than the noise around him. He pulled Manny's little chrome eagle from his pocket, its metallic edges digging into his palm. He had followed his code. He had listened to the Current and sought to bring balance, to give voice to the city's unspoken pain. But in doing so, he hadn't created peace. He had started a war—a war between art and commerce, between technical perfection and raw emotion, between the old guard and whatever new, strange thing he represented. He was still the Jedi of Davao, but the quiet path of a guardian had led him to the center of a galactic conflict, and the battle for his own soul had just begun.### Chapter 6

Sleep did not come easily. The adrenaline of the performance and the subsequent emotional whiplash left Rico frayed and raw, like a live wire exposed to the air. When he finally drifted off, his dreams were a chaotic collage of roaring crowds, flashing lights, and the cold, appraising stare of Mr. Vic. He woke with a gasp to the pale grey light of a Manila morning filtering through the hotel window. For a blissful moment, there was only silence. Then, foolishly, he reached for his phone. He had promised Manny he would call. As the cheap phone powered on, it began to vibrate with a violence that made it skitter across the bedside table. A tidal wave of notifications, a digital deluge, flooded the cracked screen. Hundreds of texts, thousands of social media alerts. His name, #RicoSandoval, was the number one trending topic in the Philippines.

He clicked on one link, then another. There were articles from major news outlets calling his performance "the most authentic moment in reality TV history." There were reaction videos of people from all walks of life—students in their dorm rooms, families crowded around a television, even a group of security guards in a monitoring station—openly weeping as they listened to his song. There were memes, too: his pained, emotional face superimposed on movie posters, his kwek-kwek cart photoshopped onto the moon. The Current, which he had always felt as a localized, geographical force, had gone global. It was now a billion-tentacled digital beast, and every one of its arms was reaching for him, projecting their own hopes, sorrows, and expectations onto his image. He felt a dizzying wave of vertigo, the terrifying sensation of his own identity dissolving into the vast, churning sea of public opinion. He wasn't Rico Sandoval anymore. He was a symbol. He quickly shut the phone off, his heart hammering. The silence that returned was no longer peaceful; it was menacing, the eerie calm before a hurricane.

Later that morning, a production assistant knocked on his door, her usual chipper demeanor replaced by a kind of nervous reverence. "Mr. Vic would like to see you," she said, her eyes wide. "In his office. Now." The summons felt inevitable. Mr. Vic’s office was on the top floor of the network tower, a minimalist expanse of glass, steel, and white leather that offered a panoramic, god-like view of the sprawling city below. Mr. Vic sat behind a vast, empty desk, the only object on it a sleek, silver laptop. He gestured for Rico to sit in the chair opposite him, the city spread out behind his head like a conquered kingdom. "Coffee?" he asked, his voice disarmingly pleasant. Rico shook his head, his throat too tight to speak.

"An interesting twenty-four hours," Mr. Vic began, forgoing any preamble. He turned his laptop around. The screen was filled with charts and graphs—spikes in viewership, social media engagement metrics, demographic data. "This," he said, tapping a sharply ascending line, "is you. In the twelve hours since your performance, you have generated more online traffic for this network than the last three seasons of this show combined. You are, at this moment, a gold mine." He closed the laptop, the numbers vanishing, and fixed Rico with his unblinking gaze. "But gold ore is useless until it's refined. What you have is raw, volatile power. My job is to build a foundry. To shape it, strengthen it, and turn it into something that can last."

He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial, persuasive murmur. "I understand what Isabel and the Maestro told you. They are artists. They think in terms of feelings and moments. I am a builder. I think in terms of careers and legacies. They see your gift as a fragile flame to be protected. I see it as a forest fire that, if properly contained and channeled, can power an entire nation. We are not going to change you, Rico. We are going to focus you. We will create 'The Rico Sandoval Story.' The humble vendor with the voice of the people. We’ll lean into it. We'll curate a list of songs—old, forgotten kundimans that you can reinvent. We’ll design a simple, rustic look. We will give the people exactly what they want from you, again and again, until you are not just a singer, but a brand."

The Current in the room was chillingly devoid of emotion. It was the hum of pure, dispassionate logic, of a brilliant mind designing a flawless machine. Rico felt a cold dread seep into his bones. This was the temptation Isabel had warned him about, but it wasn't an evil, snarling demon. It was a calm, rational, and terrifyingly convincing argument for his own success. He thought of Lola Elara’s medicines, of buying Manny a new tricycle with a sound system, of a life free from the constant anxiety of an empty biscuit tin. The path Mr. Vic was laying out was paved with gold. All he had to do was walk it. "What if the song doesn't... speak to me?" Rico managed to ask, his voice barely a whisper. Mr. Vic smiled, a thin, humourless expression. "Then you will learn to speak to it. That is what a professional does. Your feelings are the raw material, Rico. They are not the finished product. The audience's feelings are the product."

The next challenge was announced later that day, and it was a masterpiece of Vic's manipulative genius. The theme was "Rivals Duet: Love and Hate." The two contestants who were seen as polar opposites would be forced to sing together. The host announced the pairing with theatrical glee: "In this corner, the disciplined perfection of Cassandra! And in this corner, the raw, emotional power of Rico! They will be singing a classic power ballad of love and betrayal, 'When a Heart Breaks'." A photo of Rico and a furious-looking Cassandra flashed on the screen behind the host, a perfectly manufactured narrative of conflict. The room buzzed with excitement. Leo gave Rico a look that was equal parts pity and terror. This wasn't a duet; it was a cage match.

Their first rehearsal was in a sterile, soundproofed room. The air crackled with a hostility so thick Rico could feel it as a static charge on his skin. Cassandra stood by the piano, ramrod straight, sheet music held in her hand like a weapon. "Let's get this over with," she said, her voice clipped and cold. "I've broken down the harmonies. You take the lower register on the verses, I'll take the lead. On the chorus, we'll switch. The bridge is mine. Do not ad-lib. Do not deviate. Stick to the melody as written." She began to play the opening bars with a sharp, percussive precision. It was a command, not a collaboration.

Rico tried. He truly did. He stood and sang the notes as she had dictated, his voice a flat, obedient drone. The song was a story of two lovers tearing each other apart, a maelstrom of passion, anger, and regret. But their version was a sterile, technical exercise, as passionate as two robots assembling a car. He could feel nothing. The Current between them was a dead zone, a vacuum of mutual disdain. "Stop," he said finally, after another hollow run-through. "We can't sing it like this. There's no feeling. What are they fighting about? What did he do? Why is she so angry?"

Cassandra slammed her hands down on the piano keys, producing a jarring, ugly chord. "It doesn't matter!" she hissed, her perfect composure finally cracking. "It's a song! The story is in the notes, in the dynamic shifts from mezzo-forte to fortissimo! It's in the breath control required to hold the final note for twelve seconds! It's math! It's not this... this mystical nonsense you traffic in!"

"But people don't feel math, Cassandra," Rico pleaded, his frustration mounting. "They feel a story. If we don't feel it, how will they?"

"I am not here to 'feel'," she spat, her eyes blazing with a cold fire. "I am here to win. And I will not let you drag me down with your amateur, street-corner sentimentality. You will learn your part, you will sing it exactly as I've instructed, and you will stay out of my way." With that, she gathered her things and stormed out of the room, leaving Rico alone with the discordant echo of the piano and the impossible task ahead. He was trapped between a producer who wanted to package his soul and a partner who refused to acknowledge he even had one. He slumped onto the piano bench, the weight of it all pressing down on him, and for the first time, he felt the city of Manila might actually break him.He spent the rest of the day in a state of suspended animation, the hollow notes of the song a testament to his failure. The advice of the judges warred within him. Maestro Ryan and Isabel had urged him to protect his gift, to cherish its truth. Mr. Vic had commanded him to package it. But what good was a gift if it could only exist in a vacuum? What was the point of a truth that couldn't connect, couldn't find a foothold in the heart of another? He felt a profound sense of loneliness, a feeling that mirrored his first disorienting hours on the Maglev train. He was adrift again, but this time, he was surrounded by people, their energies a chaotic storm he could no longer navigate. His code, his simple Jedi path, seemed hopelessly naive in this complex, unforgiving world.

That night, sleep was a distant country he couldn't reach. The silence of his room was an accusation. He paced the floor, the plush carpet a poor substitute for the gritty, solid roof of his Davao apartment block. He needed air. He needed the city's real, unfiltered breath. He left his room and walked the hotel's long, silent corridors, a ghost in a gilded cage. As he passed a bank of elevators, he heard it. A faint, repetitive sound, almost too low to be human. It was a single, perfect note from a piano, played over and over again with a relentless, mechanical precision. It was followed by a sharp, frustrated sigh, and then the note repeated. Drawn by the familiar sound of disciplined struggle, he followed it to a small, soundproofed practice room at the end of the hall, the door slightly ajar.

He peered through the narrow opening. Inside, bathed in the cool, blue light of a single desk lamp, was Cassandra. She was hunched over the piano, her perfect posture gone, replaced by a tense, coiled energy. Her hair was pulled back messily, and her face, free from its mask of stage makeup, looked younger and startlingly vulnerable. She wasn't practicing the whole song. She was drilling a single, difficult vocal run from the bridge, a cascade of notes that demanded both power and agility. She would play the chords on the piano, sing the run, and her voice was, as always, technically flawless. But then she would stop, shake her head, and whisper a vicious, self-hating curse under her breath before starting again. Play. Sing. Curse. Repeat. It was a ritual of joyless perfectionism.

Rico didn't feel her usual Current of icy arrogance and disdain. In this private, unguarded moment, her emotional signature was completely different. It was a tight, screaming knot of pure, high-frequency panic. It was the terror of a tightrope walker who knows that one misstep means not just a fall, but utter annihilation. He suddenly understood. Her obsession with perfection wasn't born from confidence; it was forged in a desperate, suffocating fear. The fear of not being good enough. The fear of a single, human flaw undoing a lifetime of relentless work. He heard the voice of a critical father, the pressure of a famous name, the crushing weight of expectation—all of it unspoken but screaming at him through the Current.

He pushed the door open and stepped inside. She flinched, her head snapping up, the mask of cold fury instantly falling back into place. "What do you want?" she demanded, her voice a low growl. "Come to gloat? To watch me practice the basics that you seem to think are beneath you?"

Rico didn't answer her attack. He simply walked further into the room, his gaze soft, his own energy a calm, steady presence against her frantic storm. "You're wrong," he said quietly. "About the song. About why she's angry." Cassandra scoffed, turning back to the piano. "I'm not interested in your provincial philosophies about music, Sandoval. Leave."

He moved to stand beside the piano, looking down at the black and white keys. "You think she's angry because he cheated or because he left," he continued, his voice gentle but insistent. "But that's not it. Listen." He didn't sing. He just spoke the lyrics of the chorus, slowly, imbuing them with the feeling he was sensing from her. "'How could you walk away after all I gave? Was my everything not enough for you to save?'" He looked at her, and for the first time, he wasn't just seeing the contestant; he was seeing the terrified girl drilling herself into exhaustion. "She's not angry at him. She's angry at herself. She gave him everything, every perfect piece of her, and he still left. So the only conclusion she can come to is that she is fundamentally, irreparably flawed. Her everything wasn't enough. It's not hate in her voice, Cassandra. It's shame."

A tremor ran through her. Her hands, resting on the keys, curled into tight fists. "You don't know anything about me," she whispered, but the words had no force. They were a paper shield against a battering ram.

"No," Rico agreed softly. "But I know that feeling. The feeling that if you just practice a little harder, if you just hit that one note a little more perfectly, then maybe, this time, it will finally be enough. The voice in your head that says 'almost, but not quite.' The one that makes you do it again, and again, and again." He reached out, not to touch her, but to gently tap a single key on the piano—the one she had been playing over and over. "That's the heart of the song. That's the fight. Not with him. With that voice. If we don't sing that, then we're just making noise."

For a long moment, she didn't move, her head bowed, her shoulders trembling. The knot of panic in her Current pulsed, raw and exposed. He had seen past her walls, past the armor of perfection, and named the ghost that haunted her. When she finally looked up, the fury was gone from her eyes, replaced by a profound, shimmering vulnerability that mirrored what he had seen in Isabel Reyes. She looked lost. A single tear escaped and traced a path down her cheek, the first genuine, unplanned emotion he had ever seen from her. "How?" she croaked, the word barely audible. "How did you know?"

"I listen," he said simply. He offered her nothing else, no mystical explanation, no talk of his gift. He just stood there, offering a quiet space for her brokenness to exist without judgment. She wiped her tear away with a fierce, angry gesture, as if embarrassed by its escape. She took a shaky breath, composing herself not into her old, icy self, but into something new. Something brittle but determined. She turned back to the piano, her posture straight again, but the tension in her shoulders had eased.

"From the top," she said, her voice still hoarse. "And this time… tell the story." It was not an apology. It was not an offer of friendship. But it was a concession. It was the first crack in the ice. It was, in its own way, balance.### Chapter 7

The rehearsal that followed was not a collaboration born of sudden friendship. It was a tense and fragile armistice. Cassandra sat at the piano, her back rigid, but she no longer barked commands. She played the chords and listened, her face a mask of intense concentration. When Rico sang, channeling the raw, wounded core of the song's narrative, she didn't stop him. Instead, she absorbed his emotional energy, filtered it through her own formidable discipline, and gave it a new, sharper edge. She did not surrender to the emotion he had unlocked in her; she weaponized it. Her voice, once a flawless but sterile instrument, now became a blade of polished ice, honed on a whetstone of genuine pain.

They worked for hours, deconstructing and rebuilding the song. It was a painstaking negotiation between two opposing forces. Rico would push for a moment of quiet, broken vulnerability, and Cassandra would counter by shaping that vulnerability into a crescendo of defiant, controlled rage. He was the raw heart; she was the brilliant, calculating mind. The Current between them was no longer a dead zone. It was a high-tension wire, vibrating with a dangerous and captivating energy. For the first time, Rico felt the full potential of a balanced Force—not just within himself, but between two people. He was the guardian, the empath, but she was the knight, the warrior. Together, they were something more powerful than either could be alone. They were creating a story that was tragically, exquisitely complete.

On the night of the live show, a palpable tension hummed through the studio. The narrative of the "rivals duet" had been hyped all week. As Rico and Cassandra took their places, the staging itself told the story. They stood at opposite ends of a vast, dark stage, each isolated in a stark, white spotlight, like two prisoners in separate cells. Cassandra was a statue of righteous anger in a severe, blood-red dress. Rico, in his simple dark shirt, looked like the raw, open wound her fury had created. The music began, a sparse, ominous piano line played by the house band, echoing the melody they had forged in their late-night rehearsals.

Cassandra sang the first verse, and the audience drew a collective breath. Her voice was a shard of glass, perfectly clear and lethally sharp, each note a precise and painful accusation. Then Rico answered, his voice a low, wounded murmur that seemed to rise from the very floor of the stage, filled with the weight of unspoken regret. When the chorus hit, they did not just harmonize. Their voices crashed into each other, a beautiful, dissonant collision of his raw, earthbound sorrow and her soaring, crystalline fury. It was not a love song. It was the sound of a heart breaking in real-time, a breathtaking spectacle of emotional violence that was more intimate and gripping than any love scene.

The audience was spellbound, caught in the crossfire. The Current in the room was a maelstrom of remembered heartbreaks, of arguments whispered and shouted, of doors slammed and tears shed in the dark. Rico and Cassandra were no longer just singing a song; they were performing a ritual of catharsis for everyone in the room, and for the millions watching at home. They were giving voice to the universal pain of love's failure, and the effect was mesmerizing.

The climax arrived at the bridge, the section Cassandra had claimed as her own. She stepped forward, out of her spotlight, and sang the lines they had unlocked together in the darkness of the practice room. When she sang, "Was my everything not enough for you to save?", it was not a question directed at Rico. She looked out, past the lights, past the audience, into a darkness of her own making, and hurled the question at the ghost of her own deepest fear. It was a moment of such staggering, terrifying vulnerability that the entire studio seemed to stop breathing. Rico simply stood and watched her, his role in that moment not to sing, but to be the silent, empathetic witness her pain demanded. They came together for the final line, their voices finally merging not in harmony, but in a shared, devastating chord of unresolved despair that hung in the air long after the music had stopped.

The silence that followed was absolute, a black hole of shared shock and sorrow that consumed all sound. Then the eruption, even greater than the one that had followed "Neon Pulse." It was a visceral, guttural roar from the crowd, a standing ovation born not of admiration, but of profound, communal recognition.

Isabel Reyes was the first judge to speak, her voice trembling. She wasn't looking at the duo; she was looking only at Cassandra. "For years, I have watched you build a fortress around yourself, note by perfect note," she said, her own voice thick with an artist's empathy. "Tonight, you had the courage to open the gate. That is a bravery that no amount of vocal training can teach. I am in awe of you."

Maestro Ryan nodded slowly, a deep, knowing smile on his face. "In art, we often speak of the conflict between the Apollonian—the principle of order, logic, and discipline—and the Dionysian—the principle of chaos, emotion, and instinct. What we have witnessed tonight was not a victory of one over the other. It was a perfect, breathtaking, and heartbreaking synthesis. You two have just given a masterclass in what it means to be a complete artist."

Finally, there was Mr. Vic. He was not emotional. He was not awestruck. He was beaming, a wide, predatory grin that showed all his teeth. He began to applaud, a slow, deliberate clap that cut through the noise. "Bravo," he said, his voice dripping with triumphant satisfaction. "That was not a duet. That was the pilot episode of a primetime drama series. The tension! The chemistry! The narrative! People don't just want to buy a song, they want to buy a story, and you two have just given us the most compelling story of the year." He looked from Rico's weary face to Cassandra's stunned one. "Forget solo artists. I see an album. A tour. A brand. 'The Broken Hearts.' It's tragic, it's beautiful, and it will sell millions."

Backstage, amid the pandemonium, Rico and Cassandra found each other in a quiet corner away from the ecstatic production staff. The air between them was still, the high-tension wire of their collaboration now slack. She looked at him, her eyes clear of both the anger and the fear. "Thank you," she whispered, the words so soft he could barely hear them over the ringing in his ears. It was not gratitude for his help. It was an acknowledgment. For seeing her. He simply nodded, a deep weariness settling into his bones. He had survived. He had even, in a way, triumphed. But as he watched her walk away, swallowed by a crowd of congratulatory network executives, a chilling realization dawned on him. He had followed his code, using his gift to forge a connection and bring a fragile balance. In doing so, he had not just proven his own worth to the machine. He had proven he could be a tool to repair and upgrade its other parts. He was more valuable to Mr. Vic than ever. The victory did not feel like freedom. It felt like the decisive click of a masterfully forged lock, and he was the one who had just handed them the key.The days that followed were a disorienting blur of manufactured reality. The moment Rico and Cassandra’s duet ended, “The Broken Hearts” ceased to be a performance and became a product, an entity with its own gravitational pull. They were moved from their separate rooms into a two-bedroom “collaboration suite” on the executive floor, a space of shared living rooms and unspoken tensions, all under the guise of fostering their “creative synergy.” Their faces were everywhere—on morning talk shows, in gossip columns, their tragic, on-stage chemistry endlessly dissected by pundits who spoke of them as if they were characters in a novel. The machine Mr. Vic had described was now fully operational, and Rico felt its gears grinding around him, pulling him deeper into its intricate workings.

The other contestants, once peers and rivals, now treated them with a strange mixture of awe and resentment. They were no longer part of the pack. They were the main event, and the rest of the competition seemed to orbit their tragic, glittering star. Leo remained a steadfast friend, though even his easy-going warmth was now tinged with a kind of baffled respect. “It’s like they’re not even running a competition anymore, man,” he confessed to Rico one afternoon, gesturing down the hall where Cassandra was being fitted for a designer gown. “They’re just running your story. We’re all just guest stars in the Rico and Cassandra show.” The observation, meant as a compliment, landed like a stone in Rico’s stomach. He hadn’t come to Manila to be a story. He had come to sing.

He found his refuge not in the luxurious suite, but in the mundane mechanics of his old life. He would wake before dawn, long before the production assistants began their rounds, and find the hotel’s cavernous service kitchen. He befriended the pre-dawn kitchen staff, gruff, hardworking men and women whose energies were familiar and grounding. Their Currents were clear and honest, filled with the simple, relatable anxieties of paying bills, sending children to school, and enduring long shifts on their feet. While they prepped for the hotel’s breakfast buffet, Rico would find a corner, a deep metal basin, and volunteer to wash the enormous stock pots. The rhythmic work, the hot water, the scent of soap, the sheer, unglamorous reality of the chore—it was his meditation. It was the only place in the entire city where he felt like himself, a quiet man performing a simple, useful task. It was here, surrounded by the clatter of pans and the low hum of workers’ chatter, that he would make his calls home.

Manny, as expected, was ecstatic. His voice, crackling over the cheap phone's speaker, was a manic explosion of pride. “Brother! You’re a legend! ‘The Broken Hearts’! Everyone is talking about it! The tricycle drivers have a new betting pool—not if you’ll win, but what sad song you’ll sing next! Coach Berto says the gym has never been so full, everyone wants to say they know you! When you come home, they’re going to throw a fiesta! You’re bigger than Pacquiao!” Rico tried to explain the crushing pressure, the feeling of being a character in someone else’s play, but the concepts were too abstract, too far from the simple triumph Manny saw. “That’s the price of fame, my man!” Manny boomed. “Just keep singing your sad songs! They’re making you rich!”

The calls to Lola Elara were different. She never asked about the show or the judges. She asked if he was eating. She asked if he was sleeping. He didn't need to explain the hollowness he felt; she could hear it in the spaces between his words. She sensed it through the thousands of kilometers of wire and air that separated them, a dissonance in his *damdam*. “The city is a noisy place, *hijo*,” she said one morning, her voice a soft, steady anchor in the chaotic Manila Current. “It can make you forget the shape of your own soul. Remember the feel of the earth after a rain? The way the kwek-kwek sizzles in the oil? Those things are real. The rest is just weather. Do not let their storm change your season.” Her simple, poetic words were a shield. They reminded him that the brand, the story, the star—those were costumes. Underneath, he was still Rico, the boy who felt the city breathe.

The storm Lola had warned him about arrived in the form of a photo shoot. Mr. Vic’s marketing team had conceived a cover story for a major magazine, the official launch of “The Broken Hearts” brand. The set, constructed in a cavernous studio, was an art director’s fantasy of romantic decay. There was a fake window with artificial rain streaking down the glass, a single wilting rose in a vase, and furniture draped in dusty white sheets. It was a carefully curated mausoleum for a love that had never existed.

Rico arrived on set feeling a deep, spiritual exhaustion. Cassandra was already there, being attended to by a flock of stylists. She had transformed back into the consummate professional, her face a beautiful, impassive mask as makeup artists worked on her. She met Rico's eyes in the mirror, her gaze cool and unreadable. The brief, vulnerable connection they had shared in the darkness of the practice room had been sealed away, a private memory in a life that was becoming increasingly public. A stylist pushed Rico into a chair and began working on him, dabbing concealer under his eyes and artfully messing up his hair to look “poetically disheveled.” He felt like a doll being arranged for display.

“Alright, lovebirds!” the photographer, a flamboyant man with a European accent, chirped, clapping his hands. “Let’s make some tragic magic! On the set!” He positioned them near the fake rainy window, instructing them to stand close, but not touching. “Give me longing! Give me regret! Cassandra, darling, you’ve just told him it’s over. Rico, my boy, your world is shattered. You want to reach for her, but your pride won’t let you. Action!” Cassandra delivered instantly. Her posture shifted, her eyes glistened with unshed tears, her expression a perfect portrait of agonized resolve. It was a breathtaking piece of acting. The camera clicked furiously.

Then the photographer turned his lens on Rico. “Rico! More! I’m getting nothing! You look like you’re waiting for a jeepney! Feel the pain! Remember the heartbreak!” But Rico couldn’t. He tried to summon the emotion of the song, but in this sterile, artificial environment, it wouldn't come. The Current was dead. He felt only the photographer’s impatience, the hum of the studio lights, and the cloying scent of Cassandra’s hairspray. There was no story here. There was no truth. He was a dry well.

“What is wrong with him?” the photographer hissed to his assistant, loud enough for Rico to hear. Cassandra’s perfect composure fractured with a flicker of annoyance. “Rico, for goodness’ sake,” she muttered through a clenched jaw. “Just do it. It’s a job.” But her words only solidified his resistance. This wasn't his job. His job was to sell kwek-kwek and feel the city’s heart. This was something else entirely. The photographer sighed dramatically. “Fine! New setup! Rico, sit on the floor. Look broken. Cassandra, stand over him. Look down on him with pity and sorrow, like he’s a puppy you have to leave behind.”

They arranged him on the floor, a human prop. As Cassandra took her position above him, looking down with her flawlessly manufactured pity, something inside Rico finally snapped. He wasn’t a character. He wasn’t a puppy. He was a man. He thought of the boxers in the Toril gym, of Manny’s unshakeable faith, of Lola Elara’s quiet dignity. What would they think, seeing him like this? He looked directly into the camera lens, his face empty of the requested emotion. He didn't look broken or sad. He just looked tired. “I can’t,” he said, his voice quiet but clear. The photographer threw his hands up in a theatrical display of despair. “What do you mean, you can’t? It’s your brand! You are the sad kwek-kwek boy! Be sad!”

“No,” Rico said, a strange calm settling over him. He slowly got to his feet, brushing the studio dust from his pants. He looked from the frustrated photographer to Cassandra’s stunned face, and then to the entire artifice of the set. He was a guardian. He was supposed to seek balance. And this—this was the furthest thing from it. “My name is Rico Sandoval,” he said, his voice resonating with a simple, unshakeable authority that silenced the room. “I am not a brand.” And with that, he turned, walked off the set, and straight out of the studio, leaving behind a wake of shocked silence and the smoldering ruins of Mr. Vic’s perfectly constructed story.### Chapter 8

The walk from the studio was a strange, disembodying journey. Rico moved through the thronging Manila streets, but he was no longer a part of their flow. He was an obstruction, a rogue element who had willfully disconnected from the grid. The city's Current, which he had learned to navigate and even channel, now felt hostile, its million voices a chorus of accusation and judgment. He felt the frantic energy of the production assistants’ phone calls, the sharp spike of Mr. Vic’s cold fury, the confused murmur of the public internet as news of his walkout began to ripple through the system. He was a ghost haunting his own public execution. His feet, acting on an instinct for sanctuary, carried him back to the only place that had ever felt real in this city of illusions: the hotel. But he didn't go up to the suite. He took the service elevator down to the concrete heart of the building, to the sweltering, noisy kitchen.

The daytime kitchen was a different beast from the quiet pre-dawn world he knew. It was a symphony of controlled chaos—chefs barking orders, pans sizzling, the rhythmic clang of cleavers on steel. But the energy was pure. It was the honest sweat of labour, the focused drive to create and serve. He found his corner, by the deep washing sinks, and wordlessly picked up a scrubbing brush. The head chef, a burly man named Mang Tony, glanced over, saw the look on Rico’s face, and simply nodded, turning back to his sauté pan. No questions asked. Here, a man’s worth was measured by the work of his hands, not the trending topic attached to his name. He plunged his arms into the hot, soapy water, the familiar, grounding sensation a balm to his shattered nerves. He scrubbed at a scorched wok, the physical effort a release, focusing on this one, real task until the noise in his head finally began to subside. He was not a brand. He was a man washing a pan. It was the truest thing he had felt all day.

He had been there for nearly an hour when the kitchen doors swung open, admitting a slice of the cold, artificial reality he had fled. Two men in sharp, dark suits stood there, their polished shoes looking absurd on the greasy floor. Their Currents were identical: a flat, corporate hum of detached authority. They were Mr. Vic’s emissaries. “Mr. Sandoval,” the taller one said, his voice devoid of emotion. “Mr. Vic requires your presence. Immediately.” The entire kitchen fell silent. Mang Tony turned off his burner, his large hand resting on a cleaver. The air grew thick. For a moment, it was the Toril gym all over again, a community instinctively closing ranks around one of their own. Rico placed the brush down gently, dried his hands on a nearby rag, and looked at the two men. “I will not go to his office,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “If he wants to talk to me, he can come here.” The men exchanged a look of disbelief, but the steady, silent gaze of a dozen kitchen workers holding sharp objects was a powerful motivator. One of them pulled out a phone and made a hushed call.

Twenty minutes later, the impossible happened. Mr. Vic himself walked into the service kitchen. He wore the same simple, expensive black shirt, but his usual aura of untouchable calm was replaced by a tightly controlled, volcanic fury. The kitchen staff melted back, creating a wide circle around them. Mr. Vic’s eyes took in the scene—the steam, the grime, Rico in his simple clothes, hands red from the hot water—and his lip curled in a minuscule, almost imperceptible sneer. “This is your stage now, is it, Rico?” he began, his voice dangerously soft. “Trading a million viewers for an audience of dishwashers? An interesting career choice.”

“These are honest people, doing honest work,” Rico replied, his calm unwavering. Mr. Vic laughed, a dry, rasping sound. “Honesty is a luxury, Rico. A very expensive one. And you are about to find out just how much it costs. You have breached your contract. You have humiliated this network. You have jeopardized a multi-million-peso marketing campaign. I could sue you for everything you have and everything you will ever have. I can ensure that you will never again sing on a professional stage in this country, not even in a karaoke bar in the deepest, most forgotten corner of Mindanao. I can, and I will, erase you.” Each word was a perfectly aimed blow, designed to cripple and terrify.

But Rico was no longer afraid. The worst had happened. He had been offered the world and found it hollow. “You can’t erase something that is real,” Rico said. “You can only erase a brand. An image. A product. You wanted to make me a product, Mr. Vic. But my voice is not a commodity. It comes from my home. It comes from my Lola. It comes from the people in this room and the people in the Toril gym. It is their voice, too. It is not for sale.” Mr. Vic stared at him, his face a mask of cold fury and genuine disbelief. He simply could not comprehend a variable that did not respond to threats or promises of profit. He was a master of a universe where everything had a price tag, and he had just encountered an object with none. “You are a fool, Rico,” he said, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. “You are a sentimental, naive fool. You had a golden ticket, and you have just set it on fire because of some childish fantasy about a ‘real’ world that doesn’t exist.” He turned to leave, pausing at the door. “Enjoy your honest work. It’s all you’ll ever have.” He was gone, leaving behind a chilling void and the faint, expensive scent of his cologne.

The silence that followed was broken by Mang Tony placing a heavy, comforting hand on Rico's shoulder. “He does not understand,” the chef said, his voice a low rumble. “Food cooked without heart gives no nourishment. A song sung without soul gives no comfort. You did the right thing, *hijo*.” The other workers murmured their agreement, their simple, solid support a far more powerful Current than all of Mr. Vic’s threats. They offered him a plate of food, a simple meal of rice and adobo, and for the first time in weeks, Rico ate with an appetite.

He returned to the empty suite later that evening, not as a resident, but as a trespasser gathering his few belongings. The silence was thick with the ghost of Cassandra’s presence. He expected to find his things already packed and a notice of eviction. Instead, he found a small paper bag sitting on his bed. Inside was a bottle of water and a container of steamed siopao, still warm. As he stood there, confused, the adjoining door opened. Cassandra stood in the doorway, dressed not in a designer gown, but in simple gray sweatpants and a t-shirt, her face scrubbed clean of makeup. She looked tired. “I figured you hadn't eaten,” she said, her voice neutral. She gestured to the empty space where his guitar usually leaned. “They took it. The guitar. Network property, apparently.”

He nodded, a fresh pang of loss hitting him. The guitar had been his one true anchor in this place. “Cassandra, I’m sorry,” he began. “For the shoot. For walking out on you.” She shook her head, leaning against the doorframe. “Don’t be. I should be furious. My father has already called me three times, screaming. Mr. Vic is probably planning my career funeral as we speak. Being associated with you right now is professional suicide.” She looked at him, and for the first time, a small, wry smile touched her lips. “And I have never been more jealous of anyone in my entire life.” She pushed a strand of hair from her face. “All my life, I have done exactly what was expected. I’ve hit every mark, sung every note perfectly. I built a career as flawless and as hollow as a glass bird. Then you come along. You, with your sad songs and your strange feelings. You walk into the heart of the machine and you just… say no. You set your golden ticket on fire, just like he said. Do you have any idea how much courage that takes? Or how much madness?”

“It wasn't courage,” Rico said quietly. “My Lola told me not to let them plant my voice in a plastic pot. I was starting to feel the plastic around my roots.” Cassandra was silent for a long moment, a flicker of understanding in her eyes. “My father is Mr. Vic, but with a prettier office. I’ve been in that plastic pot since I was five.” She pushed herself off the doorframe. “They’ll kick you out in the morning. They’ll serve you with papers. They will make an example of you. What will you do?” He finished putting his few clothes into his small, worn backpack. The chrome eagle keychain from Manny was on the nightstand, and he clipped it to a zipper. “I’m going home,” he said. The words felt more right, more true, than anything he had sung on the big stage.

“Just like that?” she asked, a note of wonder in her voice. “You’ll just go back to selling… eggs?”

“Kwek-kwek,” he corrected gently, a faint smile touching his own lips. “It’s a humble living. But it’s an honest one.” He shouldered his backpack. Their strange, tumultuous journey was over. They stood in the silent, luxurious suite, two people from different galaxies who had, for a brief, incandescent moment, collided. He nodded a final goodbye and turned to leave. “Rico,” she called out, her voice stopping him at the door. He turned back. Her face was a battleground of conflicting emotions. “For what it’s worth,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “You were right. It wasn’t a trick. You’re no faith healer. You’re an artist. A real one.” It was the highest praise she was capable of giving, and a far greater prize than any trophy the show could offer. He gave her a small, grateful nod, and walked out of the suite for the last time, the weight of his decision settling not as a burden, but as the solid, comforting ballast of a ship finally pointed toward home.The walk from the studio was a strange, disembodying journey.

He left the hotel under the cloak of a moonless, pre-dawn sky. The siopao from Cassandra was a warm, heavy weight in his backpack, a final, complicated act of kindness in a city that had offered him nothing but. His pockets held the few hundred pesos left from the Toril gym collection and the crumpled envelope Mang Tony had pressed into his hand as he left the service kitchen. “For the ferry,” the head chef had rumbled, his gruffness a poor shield for his affection. “It’s slower, but the sea air is good for the soul.” It was the collected ‘piso-piso’ of the hotel’s unseen army—the dishwashers, the prep cooks, the laundry workers. Another bucket of coins, another dream funded by the quiet solidarity of the working class. This time, the dream was not of fame, but of home.

The journey south was the slow, deliberate unwinding of the frantic knot Manila had tied in his soul. Instead of the disembodying speed of the Maglev, he took a series of crowded, non-airconditioned buses that rumbled through the sleeping provinces of Southern Luzon. The chaotic, screaming Current of the capital receded with every kilometer, its high-frequency anxiety replaced by the gentler, earthier hum of towns waking to the rhythm of farmland and open markets. He was no longer a celebrity, a brand, or a failure. He was just another man on a long journey, his head resting against a vibrating windowpane, anonymous and blessedly insignificant.

The longest part of the journey was the inter-island ferry. For two days and two nights, the ship was his world, a slow-moving microcosm of the archipelago. He spent hours standing on the deck, the warm, salt-laced wind a constant, cleansing force. He watched flying fish skip across the waves and listened to the rhythmic thrum of the ferry’s engine, a steady, mechanical heartbeat. Here, the Current was vast and elemental. It was the deep, ancient pulse of the sea itself, the collective calm of the star-dusted sky, and the simple, transient hopes of his fellow passengers: a student going home for a fiesta, a father returning to his family after a contract job, a vendor transporting goods to another island. He slept on a narrow cot in the crowded common area, lulled by the gentle rocking of the ship and the murmur of a hundred sleeping souls. The nightmares of the studio and the boardroom finally released their grip, and he dreamed of nothing but the wide, open water.

When the ferry finally eased into the Davao port, the scent of home hit him before he even saw the familiar skyline. It was a thick, humid blanket woven from the smells of diesel exhaust, the nearby fish market, the sweet, cloying perfume of ripening jackfruit, and the metallic tang of the coming afternoon rain. He breathed it in, a deep, shuddering lungful, and the Davao Current rushed to meet him like a long-lost friend. It was the same river he had always known, but his time in the chaotic maelstrom of Manila had taught him to appreciate its steady, familiar flow. He could feel the city’s pulse with a new clarity, its rhythms no longer just a background hum but a welcome, comforting symphony.

The walk from the port to his apartment block was a journey through his own recent history. His face, plastered across news sites and social media for weeks, was now recognizable. He saw the flicker of recognition in the eyes of a street vendor, heard his name whispered by a group of students huddled at a corner. A tricycle driver slowed down, yelled “Hey, X-Factor!” and gave him a thumbs-up. His invisibility was gone, replaced by a strange, low-grade fame he hadn’t asked for and didn’t want. A familiar prickle of anxiety returned, but he grounded himself in the rhythm of his own footsteps on the familiar, cracked pavement, focusing on the thumping of the wobbly wheel of a nearby vendor’s cart, a sound that was, for him, the true rhythm of home.

He reached the low-slung concrete building that seemed to sag in the middle like an old mattress. At the entryway, as if she had never moved, was Lola Elara. She was sweeping the dusty concrete with her *walis tingting*, her strokes rhythmic and sure. She did not seem surprised to see him. Her gaze lifted from her work, and her sharp eyes took in everything in a single, sweeping glance: the exhaustion etched on his face, the worn-out backpack on his shoulders, the profound, bone-deep relief of his return. She didn’t ask about the show, the contracts, or the fallout. Her verdict on his entire Manila odyssey was delivered in six, simple words. “You are just in time for lunch,” she said, her voice gruff. “I made your favourite.”

Later that afternoon, the deafening roar of a modified engine announced the arrival of Manny. He screeched to a halt, his tricycle’s chrome eagle gleaming, and hopped out, his usual booming energy conspicuously absent. He stood before Rico, a storm of confusion and disappointment clouding his face. “Brother,” he started, his voice strained. “What happened? I saw it on the news. They said you walked out. You had it all! The record deal, the money, the fame! We were all… everyone was counting on you.” Rico didn’t try to explain the nuances of artistic integrity or the soul-crushing nature of the industry. He leaned against the familiar, gritty wall of the apartment block and met his friend’s pained gaze. “They wanted to own my voice, Manny,” he said simply. “It was never mine to sell. It belongs to the rooftop, to Lola, to the gym. It’s ours.” Manny was silent, the simple, possessive word—*ours*—sinking in. He looked at Rico, then at the bustling Davao street, so different from the polished, artificial world he had seen on TV. He shook his head slowly, a reluctant smile finally breaking through his confusion. “Hay nako, Jedi,” he sighed, clapping Rico on the shoulder. “Always making things complicated. Come on. Help me fix my taillight. It’s been flickering.” The request was an absolution. The balance was restored.

The next morning, Rico wheeled his ‘armoury’—the cart with the wobbly wheel and the soy sauce umbrella—down the three flights of stairs. The *thump-thump-thump* of the wheel on the steps was the sound of his world realigning. He set up at his usual spot near the university, the familiar smell of hot oil and sweet vinegar a profound comfort. His return had not gone unnoticed. Students whispered and pointed, some surreptitiously taking photos with their phones. His first customer, a young woman with a backpack, didn't ask for kwek-kwek. “Can I get a selfie, Kuya Rico?” she asked, holding her phone up. He gave her a polite, gentle smile. “I’m sorry, Miss,” he said. “But the tokneneng is getting cold.” She looked disappointed but bought a cup anyway. A little later, an old woman he recognized from the neighbourhood came by. She paid for her food, her wrinkled hand patting his for a brief moment. “You have a strong heart, *hijo*,” she said quietly. “Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” Her simple validation was worth more than all the roaring applause of the studio.

As the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the street, Rico cleaned his wok, the last of the day’s customers gone. He felt a profound sense of peace, a quiet rightness that had eluded him for weeks. He looked up at the silhouette of Mount Apo, the sleeping giant watching over the city. He had gone to the capital, faced the dragon in its lair, and returned not with a princess or a chest of gold, but with the simple, invaluable treasure of himself. His phone, which he had reluctantly turned on to call Lola, buzzed in his pocket. A message from an unknown number. He opened it. It was a link to a video-sharing site. His hands, still slick with oil, fumbled as he clicked it. The video that filled the screen was grainy, obviously filmed on a phone from the live audience, but the audio was crystal clear. It was him, on the X-Factor stage, singing his acoustic version of “Neon Pulse.” It had been online for less than a day and already had millions of views and thousands of comments celebrating its raw, emotional power. This was not a network-approved clip. This was a leak. As he scrolled down, his eyes caught a single comment, pinned to the top. It was from a verified account, the pristine, corporate profile of Cassandra. The comment was simple and direct, a stark contrast to the emotional chaos of the video. It read: “This is what an artist sounds like.” Rico stared at the screen, at the irrefutable evidence that his truth, once set free, had a life of its own. A slow smile spread across his face, genuine and unforced. The Jedi of Davao was home. He had found his balance. And he understood, with a quiet, thrilling certainty, that his song was far from over.The tiny, glowing screen of his phone felt like a portal to another universe, one that was continuing to spin violently without him. He stared at Cassandra’s name, her verified checkmark a small, blue badge of authority in a sea of chaotic, emotional comments. It was a single, clean line of text in a storm of digital noise, an act of defiance aimed directly at the heart of the machine they both served. The gesture was a shield, an endorsement, and a final, unexpected piece of connection. It was not triumph that Rico felt, but a profound and weary validation, the kind a soldier feels upon learning a battle was won long after he has already walked away from the war. The song was free, but it was also a ghost. It would follow him now, a digital echo he could never fully escape. He switched the phone off, the sudden darkness a welcome relief, and listened to the familiar, real-life sounds of a Davao night: the distant barking of a dog, the gentle rasp of Lola Elara’s coughing in the next room, the rumble of the last jeepney heading for the garage.

His new reality began the next morning. The crowd around his kwek-kwek cart was three times its usual size, a dense semicircle of bodies that spilled out into the street and obstructed traffic. But they were not all customers. He saw more phones than outstretched hands holding money, more people angling for a clear photo than jostling for a cup of hot tokneneng. He had become a landmark, a tourist attraction. “Kuya Rico, just one picture!” “Sing for us, Idol!” The requests came from all sides, a chorus of well-meaning but intrusive demands. He tried to focus on his work, his hands moving through the familiar ballet of dipping, frying, and serving, but the Current was a disorienting mess. The usual quiet frequencies he tuned into—the student’s test anxiety, the janitor’s weary sadness—were drowned out by a loud, pleasant, and utterly smothering wave of public adoration. It was a warm, fuzzy static that numbed his senses. He was the center of the city’s attention, and in becoming so, he had lost the ability to truly hear it. He was a lighthouse keeper blinded by his own lamp.

That evening, as he helped Lola Elara shell peanuts, he tried to explain the strange, hollow feeling. “It’s a good problem, no?” he said, his voice laced with a confusion he couldn’t hide. “They like me. They are proud. But I feel… further away from them than ever before.” Lola paused her work, her gnarled fingers stilling over the bowl. She looked at him with her ancient, knowing eyes. “When a hundred people are shouting your name, it is hard to hear one person whisper,” she said, her voice a low, soft rumble. “But the whispers are where the real stories are, *hijo*. A fever, a hungry stomach, a broken heart… these things do not shout. Your gift was for listening to the whispers. Do not be so flattered by the noise that you forget how to be quiet.” She cracked a peanut shell with a decisive snap, the sound a small, sharp punctuation mark in the quiet room. Her wisdom, as always, was a compass, pointing him back toward the true north of his purpose.

A week passed. A strange and stilted routine began to form. Rico would set up his cart, a polite, practiced smile fixed on his face, and navigate the daily flurry of selfie requests and star-struck customers. He sold more kwek-kwek than ever before, his earnings a tangible measure of his local fame. Manny had even helped him fix the wobbly wheel, declaring that “the cart of a star should not sound like a sick carabao.” But the work, once his meditation, now felt like a performance. He was playing the part of the humble kwek-kwek vendor who had turned his back on fame, a role the public had written for him. He missed the simple, profound power of an invisible act, of giving a student an extra egg and knowing he was the only one who understood the flutter of anxiety it was meant to soothe. His guardianship had become a public spectacle, and he felt the truth of his gift beginning to fray at the edges.

It was on a sweltering Tuesday afternoon that the Manila world he had abandoned came to find him. A sleek, black sedan, so out of place on the dusty, provincial street it might as well have been a spaceship, pulled up across from his cart. The crowd of students fell silent, their phones momentarily forgotten. A chauffeur in a crisp, grey uniform stepped out and opened the rear door. From the cool, dark interior emerged a figure that silenced the remaining whispers. It was Maestro Ryan. He was dressed not in his sharp television suits, but in a simple, elegant *barong tagalog* and linen trousers. He looked less like a media giant and more like a visiting poet. The legend surveyed the scene—the humble cart, the soy sauce umbrella, Rico in his grease-spattered apron—and a slow, appreciative smile touched his lips.

Ignoring the gawking crowd, the Maestro walked directly to the cart, the scent of his subtle, expensive cologne a strange counterpoint to the smell of frying oil. “Rico,” he said, his voice as warm and resonant as it was on television. “I have heard many great things about the kwek-kwek in Davao. May I try some?” He spoke not to a celebrity or a contestant, but to a fellow craftsman. Rico, momentarily stunned, wordlessly scooped a fresh batch into a paper cup and handed it to him. Maestro Ryan took a bite, chewed thoughtfully, and nodded. “Excellent,” he declared. “Perfectly balanced. Just like your music.” He then got straight to the point, his voice low so that only Rico could hear. “Your performance, and your subsequent departure, created a schism at the network, *hijo*. Mr. Vic tried to bury the story, to paint you as unprofessional and unstable. But the leak… the leak changed everything. The public is not on his side. They are on the side of the song. You’ve woken something up, Rico. You’ve reminded people that music can be more than just a product.”

Maestro Ryan gestured back toward his car. “I am not here on behalf of the network. I am here on behalf of a small, independent music collective I help to fund. We have no boardroom, no marketing department, and no interest in creating a brand. We have only a recording studio and a belief in preserving the soul of our country’s music.” He looked Rico directly in the eye, his gaze filled with a powerful, earnest proposition. “We don’t want you to sing pop hits. We want to give you a vehicle and a recording budget. We want you to travel the archipelago. Go to the mountains of the Cordillera, the fishing villages of Palawan, the forgotten towns of your own Mindanao. We want you to listen. Find the songs that are sleeping. The harvest songs, the lullabies, the laments that have been passed down for generations but never recorded. Become a guardian, Rico. Not just of quiet feelings on a city street, but of our music’s fading memory. We will not offer you a contract. We will offer you a quest.”

The Maestro placed a crisp bill on the cart, far more than the food was worth, and gave Rico a small, respectful nod. “Think about it,” he said, before turning and getting back into his car, which pulled away as silently and surreally as it had arrived. Rico was left standing in the sudden vacuum of its departure, the scent of hot oil mingling with the ghost of possibility. He looked at the faces in the crowd, no longer just a gallery of fans, but the very people whose heritage the Maestro was asking him to save. He looked down at his cart, his humble armoury, and then up at the familiar, sleeping giant of Mount Apo. He had walked away from one path to fame. Now, another had been laid at his feet, a path that led not to a plastic pot in Manila, but back to the very soil from which his gift had sprung. The choice was no longer between selling out and staying true. It was a choice between two profoundly different ways to be a guardian.### Chapter 10

The black sedan disappeared into the chaotic flow of traffic, but its presence lingered, a silent, gravitational ripple in the fabric of Rico’s world. He stood behind his cart, the smell of hot oil and vinegar suddenly seeming thin and mundane. The crowd of onlookers, sensing the moment of high drama had passed, began to drift away, their curiosity sated, leaving him in the familiar quiet of a late afternoon. Maestro Ryan’s proposition was not a thunderclap like the phone call from X-Factor; it was a quiet, insistent hum that resonated with the deepest parts of his being. It was not an offer of fame, but of purpose. The path Mr. Vic had offered was a superhighway to a destination he didn't want, paved with gold and lined with mirrors. This new path was a barely-there trail leading into an unknown wilderness, armed only with a map and a mission. He looked at the faces of the people passing by, the old woman with the stooped back, the young boy kicking a worn-out ball, and he saw them not just as sources of present-day emotion, but as living libraries, the latest editions in a long, unbroken line of stories and songs. The choice wasn't a choice at all. It was a recognition of his true calling.

That evening, the air in their small apartment was thick with the fragrant steam of simmering ginger and lemongrass for Lola Elara’s tea. Rico sat on the low wooden stool, the same spot where he had presented his empty biscuit tin in despair just weeks before. This time, he was full, not with desperation, but with a quiet, terrifying clarity. He told her everything, laying out the Maestro’s offer not as a question, but as a statement of intent. He watched her face for any sign of disappointment or fear at the thought of him leaving again, this time for a journey with no clear end. She listened without interruption, her hands methodically braiding strips of pandan leaf into a small, fragrant bundle. When he finished, she did not speak for a long time. She simply continued her work, the rustle of the leaves the only sound in the room. Finally, she looked up, her gaze cutting through all his anxieties.

“When your mother was a little girl,” Lola began, her voice a soft, raspy whisper, “her own grandmother would tell her that our ancestors did not die. They just became stories. They became the river, the mountain, the song the fishermen sing to call the fish. She believed that if you were quiet enough, you could still hear them singing in the wind. This man, this Maestro, he is not asking you to leave home, *hijo*. He is asking you to go and find its oldest rooms.” She held up the small, fragrant bundle of pandan she had woven. “Some people are born to be a sturdy post in the house, holding up the roof. Others are born to be the wind that travels between the islands, carrying the seeds. You were born to be the wind, Rico. Go. Listen to the ancestors for us.” She placed the pandan bundle in his hand. It was not a keepsake. It was a blessing.

Telling Manny was a different kind of test. He found his friend the next day at the tricycle terminal, polishing the chrome eagle with a devotion usually reserved for religious icons. As Rico explained the new plan—the traveling, the listening, the absence of television cameras and stadium concerts—Manny’s face went through a rapid series of expressions: confusion, then disappointment, then a slow, dawning comprehension. “So, wait,” he said, setting his polishing rag down. “You’re telling me, the Maestro, the biggest legend in music, came all the way here to tell you to become… a wandering librarian? For songs?” The idea was so alien to his dreams of spotlights and screaming fans that he couldn’t quite grasp it. Rico nodded. “Something like that.” Manny scrubbed a hand over his face, paced a tight circle around his tricycle, and then stopped, looking at Rico with a new intensity. “A Jedi quest,” he said, his eyes lighting up with a different kind of excitement. “A real one! Not for fame, but to find the lost Holocrons… of music! To fight the dark side of… forgotten songs! Of course! Why didn't I see it before?” In his own beautifully simple way, Manny had translated the mission into their shared language. He threw his arm around Rico’s shoulder, his disappointment replaced by a fierce, adventurous pride. “You’re going to need a good mechanic on this quest, brother. When my kid is a little older, you call me. I’ll be your official motorcade and repair crew for the whole damn archipelago.”

Two weeks later, the quest became real. A sturdy, dark green, second-hand Tamaraw FX van, unassuming but built for rugged roads, was delivered to their apartment block. It drew as much attention as the Maestro’s sedan. Inside, the back had been expertly converted. It was not a luxurious tour bus but a mobile field station. There was a simple fold-down cot, a small solar panel on the roof connected to a power station, and, nestled in custom-built, foam-padded cases, the equipment: a laptop loaded with professional audio software, a pair of high-fidelity microphones that looked like delicate surgical instruments, and a set of quality headphones. This was his new armoury. The microphones were his new stethoscopes, designed to listen not to the frantic pulse of a modern city, but to the faint, ancient heartbeat of the land itself. He ran a hand over the cool metal casing of one of the microphones, a feeling of profound rightness settling deep in his spirit. His wok had allowed him to feed the people’s bodies. This would allow him to feed their souls.

His departure was as quiet as his quest was meant to be. There was no fanfare, no motorcade. Just Lola Elara, Manny, and a handful of friends from the neighbourhood gathered in the cool light of dawn. Lola pressed a small pouch of medicinal herbs into his hand. “For fevers and bad spirits,” she instructed. Manny handed him a heavy, metal toolbox. “For everything else,” he said with a grin. Rico hugged them both, a deep, silent gratitude passing between them. He climbed into the driver's seat of the Tamaraw, the engine turning over with a reliable, unglamorous rumble. He looked at the small, familiar crowd, the sagging concrete building, the street just beginning to wake. He was leaving home, but this time, he was taking it with him. He put the van in gear and pulled away, not with the frantic desperation of an escape, but with the slow, deliberate purpose of a pilgrimage.

He drove south first, away from the cities, deep into the heart of his own island of Mindanao. The paved highways gave way to gravel roads, the urban sprawl dissolving into vast plantations and then into the dense, primal green of the jungle. He rolled down the window, letting the thick, loamy air fill the van. The Current began to change. The noise of a million individual human lives faded, replaced by something older, deeper. It was the slow, patient, green-and-brown energy of the land itself. He parked the van by the side of a road that was little more than two dirt tracks, near a grove of ancient, towering lauan trees. He took one of the microphones and a portable recorder, and walked into the forest. He didn't know what he was looking for. He just followed his Lola’s advice. He became quiet. He leaned against the immense trunk of a tree, closed his eyes, and listened. He listened past the buzz of insects and the chatter of birds. He let the Current flow through him, and for the first time, he felt it—a whisper. It was a faint, melodic echo, a sad, slow tune that seemed to emanate from the trees themselves, a song of wood, and time, and memory. It was the voice of the ancestors. The Jedi of Davao opened his eyes, a profound sense of awe washing over him. He raised the microphone, hit record, and began his true work.
