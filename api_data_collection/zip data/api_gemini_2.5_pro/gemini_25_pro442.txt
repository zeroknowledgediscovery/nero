The floorboards of the Beach Ballroom groaned a familiar, friendly complaint under Aela Kenna’s feet. It was a sound as much a part of Aberdeen as the cry of gulls and the relentless shushing of the North Sea against the shore just a hundred metres away. To anyone else, it was just old wood. To Aela, it was a vibration, a low thrum that travelled up through the soles of her worn dance shoes and into her bones, a rhythm that sang in concert with the deeper, silent music of the city. The Force here wasn't like the pristine, humming currents of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, a place she’d only seen in archival holos. Here it was a wilder thing, smelling of salt and diesel and frying onions from the chipper down the street. It was gritty. Real. It had character.

“Right, again. From the top of the chorus,” Ewan said, his voice puffing out in white clouds in the cavernous, unheated hall. He wiped a hand across his forehead, smearing sweat into his fringe of sandy hair. “And this time, try not to look like you’re contemplating the heat death of the universe when we do the double turn. A wee smile, Kenna. The judges like a smile.”

Aela rolled her eyes, but a grin tugged at her lips anyway. “I am smiling. This is my delighted face.”

“Aye, it’s a terrifying sight. You look like you’ve just been served a cold rowie.” He clapped his hands together, the sound echoing off the high, domed ceiling. “Five, six, seven, eight…”

They fell back into the routine, a frantic, leg-tangling fusion of lindy hop and something much, much older, something with its roots in the Outer Rim cantinas where gravity was more of a suggestion than a rule. Ewan was the anchor, the solid, dependable core of the dance. He was all muscle and timing, a metronome in human form. Aela was the flair, the impossible spin that went on just a fraction of a second too long, the lift that seemed to hang in the air, defying the planet’s pull. Ewan thought it was technique, a trick of balance and core strength. He didn’t feel the gentle, invisible hand of the Force that she used to cushion the landing, to extend the arc of a leap, to feel his next move before he’d even begun to think it himself. It was their secret weapon, and only half the team knew it existed.

For two years, they’d been a local phenomenon. The odd pair from the Granite City who kept winning regional heats, climbing the ladder of the Northern Lights Galactic Dance-Off. It had started as a laugh, a way for Aela to use her… gifts in a way that didn’t involve deflecting blaster bolts or mediating trade disputes. Dancing was pure joy. It was connection, a conversation without words, and it felt more essential to the spirit of the Jedi code than half the dry texts she’d been forced to study as a youngling. The Order preached connection to all living things, and what was a dance floor if not a microcosm of the universe, all bodies spinning in a shared, chaotic harmony?

They finished the sequence, Aela landing neatly from a throw that should have sent her sprawling. She was barely out of breath, her body thrumming with a pleasant energy. Ewan, on the other hand, was bent double, hands on his knees, gulping in the cold, damp air.

“You’re a machine, Kenna. A bloody machine,” he wheezed.

“Years of clean living and a healthy diet,” she said, her voice full of mischief. She nudged his shoulder with her foot. She neglected to mention that her ‘healthy diet’ often included a deep-fried Mars bar and that her stamina came from a source that had nothing to do with cardio.

It was then that the air in the centre of the room began to shimmer. A low hum vibrated, cutting through the silence, and a column of blue light solidified, casting long, dancing shadows across the floor. Ewan straightened up, his exhaustion forgotten, his eyes wide. He’d seen it a dozen times, but Aela’s private comm system never failed to startle him. A tiny, silver sphere she kept in her pocket was projecting the image.

“Aela Kenna of Aberdeen,” a rich, sonorous voice announced, the Galactic Basic accent crisp and formal. “Congratulations. Your application to the final stage has been successful. You are officially invited to compete in the Grand Final of the Northern Lights Galactic Dance-Off, to be held on the orbital platform ‘Starlight Spire’ in three standard weeks.”

The air rushed out of Aela’s lungs. She stared at the shimmering blue logo of the competition authority hanging in the air between them. The final. They’d actually made it. They’d talked about it, dreamed about it, but it had always felt like a distant star, a theoretical possibility. Now it was real. It was happening.

Ewan let out a whoop that was entirely without grace or dignity, a raw, guttural cry of pure Aberdonian delight. He grabbed Aela by the waist and lifted her off her feet, spinning her around until the grand old ballroom blurred into a swirl of gold leaf and dusty velvet.

“We did it! Kenna, we bloody well did it!” he yelled, his voice cracking. “The Spire! Can you believe it? They have actual zero-g dance floors in the lobby!”

Aela laughed, a real, uninhibited laugh that echoed Ewan’s own. “Put me down, you great galoot, before you dislocate something!”

He set her down, but his hands stayed on her arms, his face shining with a delirious joy she felt reflected in her own heart. This was it. This was the moment. All the cold mornings, the aching muscles, the splinters from the old floorboards, the endless repetition—it was all for this. A chance to dance on the biggest stage in the sector. A chance to prove that a girl from a rain-lashed city at the edge of the galaxy could create something beautiful.

Later, huddled in the warmth of The Prince of Wales, a pint of heavy in Ewan’s hand and a sparkling water in hers, the reality began to sink in. The pub was noisy, filled with the post-work chatter of oil rig workers and university students, but they were in their own bubble of giddy disbelief.

“The Starlight Spire,” Ewan repeated for the tenth time, staring into his beer as if it held the secrets of the cosmos. “They say the windows are a kilometre high. You can see the whole curvature of the planet.”

“I’m more interested in the floor,” Aela said. “Sprung Alderaanian timber, they say. Responsive. It’ll be like dancing on a drum.”

“We’ll need new costumes. Something flashy. None of this practice gear.” His eyes were already distant, planning. “I’m thinking sequins. A controversial amount of sequins.”

“You’ll look like a disco ball from Nar Shaddaa,” she chuckled.

“Exactly! Understated is for losers, Kenna. We’re in the final. We’re here to be noticed.”

Aela took a sip of her water, the bubbles fizzing on her tongue. It was easy to get swept up in Ewan’s infectious enthusiasm. He saw the glitter, the glory, the grand adventure of it all. She saw that too, but she also felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle on her shoulders. For her, this wasn’t just about sequins and sprung floors. It was a test. A real, public test of her discipline. To use the Force in the dance was to walk a razor’s edge. Too little, and their routines were merely good. Too much, and she risked revealing herself. A lift that hovered too long, a spin that was too perfectly balanced, a leap that defied physics just a little too blatantly. It required a constant, delicate control, a meditative focus in the midst of chaos. It was, she had often thought, the most Jedi thing she did.

Her pocket buzzed, a different, more discreet vibration than the holoprojector. She excused herself from the jubilant Ewan and slipped out into the narrow, cobbled lane behind the pub. The air was cold and smelled of stale beer and the nearby harbour. She pulled the silver sphere out again, but this time she keyed in a different frequency. The blue light that coalesced in front of her was not a corporate logo, but the serene, lined face of a Togruta female, her white-and-blue montrals curving gracefully.

“Master T’kora,” Aela said, bowing her head slightly.

“Aela,” the voice was warm, but held a note of caution. “I felt your… excitement. A powerful surge. The results of your competition?”

“We’re in the final, Master.”

There was a long pause. Aela could picture her master perfectly, sitting in the quiet meditation chamber of the hidden enclave on a forgotten moon halfway across the galaxy. She could feel her master’s concern, a gentle pressure against her own mind.

“This path you have chosen continues to surprise me, my former Padawan,” Master T’kora said finally. “Fame. Public spectacle. These are not the traditional pursuits of a Jedi Knight.”

“It’s not about fame,” Aela countered, her voice quiet but firm. “It’s about connection. The Order is scattered, hidden. We’re becoming a myth. People have forgotten what it feels like to see something… miraculous. Something that gives them hope. When we dance, and I let the Force flow just a little, people feel it. They don’t know what it is, but they feel the joy. The harmony. Isn’t that our purpose? To bring light?”

“There is a difference between bringing light and seeking a spotlight, Aela. The line is finer than you think. Pride is a swift path to the dark side, and victory can be a seductive poison.”

“I ken the risks, Master.” The Scots phrase slipped out, as it always did when she was earnest or stressed. “But I can’t live my life hiding in the shadows. The Force is not just for fighting sith and meditating on rocks. It’s for living. For… for dancing.”

Master T’kora was silent for another moment, her gaze deep and thoughtful. “Your spirit was always too bright for the cloisters, Aela Kenna. Your argument has merit. But be vigilant. The Starlight Spire attracts more than just dancers. It is a hub of immense wealth, ambition, and corruption. Be mindful of your thoughts. And of those around you. Not all who smile in the light are your friends.”

“I will be, Master. I promise.”

The image flickered and died, leaving Aela alone in the cold, dark lane. She looked up, past the slate roofs and granite walls, to the patch of sky visible between the buildings. A single, bright star pulsed against the encroaching clouds. The Starlight Spire. She felt a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold. It was a thrill, sharp and clear as a ringing bell. A thrill mixed with a faint, low hum of apprehension. Master T’kora was right. The final would be different. The stakes were higher now, and the shadows were bound to be deeper. But she couldn’t turn back. She wouldn’t. She had a final to win.She pushed the thoughts away, sealing them in a quiet corner of her mind, and went back inside the pub. The wall of warmth and noise hit her like a physical blow. Ewan hadn't moved, but he’d acquired a second pint and was now sketching designs on a damp napkin. He looked up as she slid back onto the stool, his eyes bright with inspiration. “I’m thinking asymmetrical. You in something dark, like the night sky over the North Sea, and me in silver, like the first star. Or maybe a lighthouse beam. We need a story. The judges love a story.” Aela picked up her water, watching him. He was a force of nature in his own right, a whirlwind of earthly enthusiasm that was the perfect counterweight to her own celestial secrets. It was this partnership, this balance, that made them work. She was the star, but he was the gravity that kept her from spinning away into the cold void.

The three weeks that followed were a blur of frenetic activity that seemed to pull the entire city into their orbit. Word of their success had spread like wildfire through the granite streets. The local holonews ran a feature on them, “The Granite City’s Astrodancers,” and suddenly everyone wanted a piece of their story. A fish merchant from the market, whose daughter was in Ewan’s beginner’s class, offered to sponsor their travel costs. A wizened old woman who owned a fabric shop on George Street gifted them bolts of shimmering, starlight-threaded cloth from her private stock, claiming she’d been “saving it for a special occasion for fifty years.” Ewan, emboldened, took his napkin sketches to a theatrical costumer who usually worked with the Tivoli Theatre, and together they created outfits that were somehow both elegant and outrageously gaudy. Aela’s was a deep, midnight blue that drank the light, studded with tiny, winking crystals. Ewan’s was a tailored, razor-sharp suit of brilliant silver that, as he’d gleefully predicted, made him look like a very well-dressed disco ball.

Their final practice in the Beach Ballroom felt different. It was still cold, the floorboards still groaned their familiar welcome, but the space felt charged with farewell. They ran their routine one last time, not for technique, but for the pure joy of it. In the familiar space, under the grand dome that had seen a century of dancers, they moved in perfect sync, a fusion of grit and grace. When the final note of their practice track faded, they stood in silence, breathing in the history of the hall, the smell of dust and salt and time. Ewan slung an arm around Aela’s shoulders. “Next time we dance on this floor, we’ll be Galactic Champions,” he said, his voice quiet, stripped of its usual bravado. It wasn’t a boast. It was a promise. Aela leaned her head against his shoulder, feeling the solid, dependable beat of his heart. “No pressure, then,” she murmured.

The Aberdeen Interplanetary Port was less a gleaming gateway to the stars and more a functional, wind-battered shed bolted to the edge of the coastline. The air was thick with the competing smells of ozone from charging ship capacitors and the pungent aroma of the nearby fish processing plants. Dour-faced dock workers in heavy overalls moved cargo with gruff efficiency while seagulls wheeled and screamed overhead, occasionally dive-bombing anyone with an unwatched sandwich. It was pure Aberdeen, and Aela loved it with a fierce loyalty. Ewan, however, looked like a kid on his first trip to the seaside. He gawked at the hulking freight haulers, the sleek passenger shuttles, and the battered bounty hunter ships that looked like they were held together with little more than rust and stubbornness. He pressed his face to the grimy terminal window, staring at their vessel, the ‘Starlight Express’, a mid-range passenger liner that looked impossibly glamorous against the grey, churning sea.

The ascent was a gut-lurching, rattling climb that had Ewan gripping his armrests with white knuckles, a fixed, terrified grin on his face. For Aela, the sensation was as familiar as walking, a simple transition from one place to another. But then they broke through the thick blanket of grey cloud that perpetually hugged the Aberdeenshire coast and the cabin was flooded with unfiltered sunlight. Below them, the clouds stretched out like a field of snow, and above, the sky deepened from azure to the infinite, velvety black of the void. Ewan’s grip on the armrest slackened. “Wow,” he breathed, the word a soft exhalation of pure wonder. Aela watched him, and in his wide, astonished eyes, she saw the galaxy anew. It wasn’t just a collection of star charts and hyperspace lanes, of threats to be monitored and conflicts to be mediated. It was beautiful. It was a miracle. And she was taking her best friend to go dance among the stars.

Docking with the Starlight Spire was like a minnow swimming up to a whale. The station was a masterpiece of celestial engineering, a glittering spindle of light and metal that pierced the darkness of space, tethered to the planet below by a shimmering thread of a space elevator. Their shuttle was guided into a vast, cavernous docking bay, one of hundreds that studded the station’s circumference. The moment the ramp hissed open, the difference was palpable. The recycled, utilitarian air of the shuttle was replaced by an atmosphere that was cool, clean, and faintly scented with something floral and exotic. The clang and rattle of the Aberdeen port was gone, replaced by a low, pleasant hum of advanced technology and the murmur of a hundred different languages. The floor wasn’t stained concrete, but polished, pearlescent material that swirled with captured light. Beings of a dozen species glided past them in elegant, expensive clothes, their faces a mixture of boredom and entitlement. Ewan stopped dead at the top of the ramp, his silver suit bag clutched in his hand, and simply stared. “Toto,” he whispered to Aela, his voice filled with awe, “I’ve a feeling we’re not in the Granite City anymore.”## Chapter 2

Their assigned quarters were a silent, minimalist suite of white and chrome, with one wall made entirely of transparent aluminum, revealing a breathtaking, terrifying view of the planet’s turquoise curve haloed by the thin blue line of its atmosphere. It was a far cry from Aela’s small flat overlooking the grey slate roofs of Rosemount, or Ewan’s chaotic bachelor pad filled with old dance trophies and empty pizza boxes. Ewan immediately activated the room’s integrated sound system, flooding the sterile space with a raucous playlist of vintage Terran rock music, a small act of rebellion against the oppressive quiet. He bounced on the edge of the bed, testing its firmness. “It’s like a hotel for gods. Did you see the welcome basket? It’s got fruit I can’t even name. One of them looks like a purple explosion.”

Aela didn’t answer. She stood before the immense window, her hand resting against its cool, unyielding surface. She closed her eyes, filtering out Ewan’s music and the low thrum of the station’s life support, and reached out with the Force. It was exactly as she’d feared, and yet nothing like it. The Force on the Spire wasn’t wild and raw like at home; it was a tightly woven tapestry. The surface threads were smooth, singing with the contentment of wealthy tourists and the focused calm of the station’s professional crew. But beneath that placid surface was a tangled, discordant mess. She felt sharp, jagged bursts of ambition from the other competitors, a knot of cold greed emanating from the high-stakes gambling halls on the upper levels, and a pervasive, cloying layer of desperation from those who had come to the Spire to make their fortune and were failing. It was a city in the sky, with all the light and shadow of any city, just amplified and contained.

“You’ve gone quiet again,” Ewan said, his voice softer now. He came to stand beside her at the window. “Thinking about the heat death of the universe?”

“Something like that,” she said, opening her eyes. She offered him a small smile. “It’s just… a lot to take in. We’re a long way from the Beach Ballroom.”

“Aye, we are.” He followed her gaze down to the swirling cloud patterns on the planet below. “But the floor’s still a floor and the music’s still music. The rest is just scenery, Kenna. Don’t let the fancy windows spook you.” He nudged her, his simple, unwavering faith a grounding presence in the overwhelming strangeness of the place. He was right. The fundamentals were the same. The connection between them, the rhythm, the story they told with their bodies—that was what mattered. That was their truth, and it was just as valid here as it was in a drafty hall in Aberdeen.

The official welcome reception was held in the ‘Celestial Atrium’, a vast, multi-levelled space at the heart of the Spire. A waterfall of shimmering, phosphorescent liquid cascaded down a central column, and the air was filled with the sound of a string quartet playing a polite, classical arrangement. Wait-droids hovered with trays of sparkling beverages and impossibly intricate canapés. Ewan, decked out in his least-creased non-sequined shirt, was in heaven, sampling everything and trying to subtly engage a droid in conversation. Aela, nursing a glass of water, felt a dozen sets of eyes on them. They were the outliers, the curiosities. The other five finalist pairs were clustered in small, exclusive groups, their body language radiating a professional coolness that bordered on hostile. They were all sleek, toned, and dressed in effortlessly expensive ‘leisure wear’ that probably cost more than Aela’s entire flat.

It wasn’t long before they were approached. A man and a woman detached themselves from a group and glided towards them. They were almost unnervingly beautiful, with matching platinum-blonde hair and piercing blue eyes. Their movements were economical and precise, as if they were conserving energy even while standing still. The man’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Aela Kenna and Ewan… MacLeod?” he said, deliberately stumbling over Ewan’s name. “Valerius and this is Lyra. From Chandrila. We’ve been reviewing the archival footage of the regional heats. Your style is very… energetic.”

“We call it dancing,” Ewan said, his Aberdonian accent thickening in defiance. “You should try it sometime. Looks like you’ve got a broomstick up your arse.”

Lyra’s perfectly sculpted lips thinned. “Energy is no substitute for technique. Raw power is so… unrefined. It’s the mark of the outer systems. All passion, no control.”

Aela felt a flash of anger, hot and sharp, but she banked it down, smoothing her own presence in the Force until it was as calm as a still loch. She gave Lyra a serene smile. “Control is important,” she agreed, her voice soft and even. “But a dance without passion is just gymnastics. It’s the difference between a poem and an instruction manual. One touches the soul, the other just tells you how the parts fit together.”

Valerius’s gaze sharpened, a flicker of genuine interest in his cold eyes. He studied her for a moment, his head tilted. “A surprisingly articulate thought from a provincial. Perhaps you are not quite the primitives we assumed. This might be an interesting competition after all.” He gave a curt nod and, without another word, he and Lyra turned and glided away, rejoining their circle like two pieces of a flawless, sterile machine.

“Pompous gits,” Ewan muttered, grabbing a passing canapé that looked like a miniature nebula. “Instruction manual? I’ll show him an instruction manual. I’ll write one on his face.”

“Let them think what they want,” Aela said, her gaze following the Chandrilan pair. “They’re not our audience.” She could feel the truth of her master’s warning settling in. Valerius and Lyra were the embodiment of pride. Their dancing, she sensed, would be a demonstration of superiority, a statement of their own perfection. It was a performance aimed at judges, at critics. It was a dance of the ego. Their own routine was the opposite. It was a conversation, an invitation. It was for the people in the back row, for the person having a bad day, for the pure, unadulterated joy of movement. It was a dance of the spirit. And in this glittering, sterile palace in the sky, she was more certain than ever which one the galaxy truly needed to see.They left the reception soon after, Ewan’s good mood soured by the encounter. He walked with a new, defensive energy, his shoulders set as if ready for a fight. Aela, in contrast, felt a strange sense of calm. The Chandrilans had defined the terms of engagement, and in doing so, had revealed their weakness. They saw the competition as a technical exam, and Aela knew, with a certainty that resonated deep in her bones, that this final wasn't about a perfect score. It was about telling a story the audience would feel in their chests, a story of joy and grit and defiance. A story from a rain-lashed city at the edge of the galaxy that was just as grand as any epic from the Core Worlds.

To distract Ewan from his muttering, Aela suggested they find the main performance hall. Following the station’s elegant, glowing signage, they navigated through corridors of shimmering obsidian and past lounges where impossibly wealthy patrons played high-stakes card games with silent, intense focus. They finally arrived at a pair of towering, carved wooden doors. They swung open silently at their approach, revealing the Starlight Arena. The sight stole the breath from their lungs. The hall was a perfect circle, vast and cathedral-like. The far wall was a single, uninterrupted window a kilometre high, looking out into the pure, star-dusted blackness of space. The planet below was not visible from this side of the station, leaving only the infinite, silent dance of distant galaxies. And in the centre, gleaming under soft, ambient light, was the floor. It was a huge circle of pale, amber-coloured wood, its grain swirling in patterns like captured smoke. It was the famed Alderaanian timber.

Ewan let out a low whistle, his annoyance with Valerius and Lyra forgotten, replaced by a craftsman’s reverence. He walked to the edge of the stage, crouching down to run his hand over the polished surface as if it were a sacred relic. “Look at that,” he breathed. “Perfectly joined, not a seam in sight. They say you can feel the energy of the whole room through this stuff.” Aela stepped onto the floor herself, her worn dance shoes making no sound. He was right, but it was more than he knew. Through the soles of her shoes, the Force sang to her. The wood was alive, imbued with the echoes of a thousand legendary performances. She could feel the ghost of a prima ballerina’s desperate pirouette, the triumphant stomp of a Twi’lek folk dancer, the joyful, syncopated rhythm of a Rodian jazz troupe. The floor was a library of emotion, and it welcomed her, a low, resonant thrum of approval that vibrated up into her very soul. This was her stage.

“A beautiful instrument, is it not?” The voice, smooth as Corellian brandy, startled them both. A man had emerged from the shadows at the edge of the arena, his expensive leather shoes making no sound on the polished concourse. He was tall and impeccably dressed in a suit of dark, crushed velvet that seemed to absorb the light around him. His face was handsome, but sharp, with eyes the colour of credits and a smile that was all practiced charm. Aela felt an immediate and visceral chill. The man’s presence in the Force was a void, a carefully shielded null-space that screamed of calculation and predatory intent. It was the signature of someone not just devoid of light, but actively, consciously concealing a deep and profound darkness.

“You must be the Aberdonian pair,” the man said, gliding closer. He offered a hand first to Ewan, who shook it automatically. “Xylon Rhee. I’m a patron of the arts, and an admirer of raw talent.” His eyes flicked to Aela, and his smile widened, though it never warmed. “I saw your heat from Bothawui. Astonishing. The power, the sheer, unbridled life in your performance. It makes the soulless perfectionism of pairs like the Chandrilans look like what it is: an exercise in vanity.” Ewan puffed up slightly at the praise, a grin finally breaking through his earlier mood. “Aye, well. We’re not here to mess about. Glad someone appreciates a bit of heart.”

Xylon Rhee laughed, a low, pleasant sound that grated on Aela’s nerves. “Heart is precisely what the galaxy pays to see. And to bet on.” He lowered his voice, creating a bubble of intimacy in the vast, empty hall. “The odds are stacked against you, of course. The judges favour the established, Core-World styles. They reward polish over passion. A victory for you would be… an upset. A very profitable upset for those with the courage to back an underdog.” He let the words hang in the air, his gaze fixed on Aela, as if he knew she was the one who truly understood the subtext. He wasn't just a patron; he was a gambler, a high-level player in the station's shadow economy.

Aela felt the trap in his words. He was probing, looking for a weakness, an angle. He was offering a poisoned chalice, hinting at a partnership that would inevitably come with strings attached. To even entertain his offer would be to step into the world of fixed matches and compromised integrity, the very corruption her master had warned her about. “We’re just dancers, Mr. Rhee,” Aela said, her voice polite but cool. She gave him the same serene, unreadable smile she had given Lyra. “We’re not interested in the odds. We’re just here to do our best.” She felt Ewan glance at her, a flicker of confusion in his eyes, but he stayed silent, trusting her lead.

For a heartbeat, the charming mask slipped. A flicker of cold, reptilian annoyance crossed Xylon Rhee’s face before it was smoothed away again. He saw her refusal for what it was, and he didn’t like it. “Of course,” he said, his voice a shade less warm. “Purity of intent. How… refreshing.” He gave them a shallow bow, a gesture of mockery more than respect. “I will be watching your performance with great interest. I do hope your… authenticity… is enough.” With that, he turned and melted back into the shadows from which he had come, his chilling presence in the Force receding like a cold tide.

The moment he was gone, Ewan let out an excited breath. “Can you believe that? Xylon Rhee! They say he owns half the casinos on the upper levels. And he hates the Chandrilan fops as much as we do! ‘Polish over passion,’ he said. The man gets it!” Aela remained silent, staring at the spot where Rhee had vanished. The encounter had left a residue, a greasy film on the vibrant energy of the arena. “Aela? You alright? You gave him the cold shoulder a bit, there.” She turned to Ewan, forcing a reassuring smile. She couldn’t explain the void she’d felt, the predatory chill that had nothing to do with the station’s air conditioning. “I just have a bad feeling about him, Ewan,” she said simply. “He’s not interested in art. He’s interested in money. People like that don’t care who they have to break to get what they want.” Ewan’s excitement deflated, replaced by a thoughtful frown. He knew Aela. He knew her quiet moods and her sharp, often inexplicable instincts. If she said someone was bad news, he believed her, even without knowing why. “Right,” he said, his jaw tightening. “Another git, then. Just a richer, smoother one.” He looked from her worried face to the magnificent, empty dance floor. “Well, he’s not going to ruin this for us. No one is.”## Chapter 3

The day of the final arrived not with a bang, but with a silent, pressurised hum. Back in their suite, the silence was a living thing, broken only by the rhythmic click of Ewan pacing back and forth across the polished floor. He was already in his silver suit, refusing to sit down for fear of creasing it. He radiated a frantic energy, a live wire of nervous excitement and sheer terror that Aela could feel bouncing off the pristine white walls. He checked the synchronisation of their music track for the tenth time, adjusted his cuffs, and smoothed his sandy hair until it stood on end. Aela, by contrast, sat cross-legged on her bed, her midnight-blue dress laid out beside her. Her eyes were closed, not in rest, but in focus. She was a pool of stillness in the centre of his storm, her presence in the Force a calm, steady anchor. She breathed in the sterile, recycled air of the station and breathed out the memory of salt and diesel and the groaning floorboards of home, grounding herself in the gritty reality she came from.

“They’re going to hate us,” Ewan blurted out, stopping his pacing to stare at the window as if he could see the judges from there. “They’re going to look at my suit and think I’m a joke. They’re going to look at us and see a couple of upstarts from a backwater mudball.”

Aela opened her eyes. “Let them,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. “We’re not dancing for them. We’re dancing for the woman who gave us the fabric. We’re dancing for the fish merchant who paid for our tickets. We’re dancing for every person who ever dreamed of doing something impossible. We’re dancing for Aberdeen.” She stood and picked up her dress. The tiny crystals winked at her like a private constellation. “Now, are you going to help me with this zip, or are you going to wear a hole in the floor before we even get to the stage?” His anxiety didn’t vanish, but it subsided, replaced by a flicker of his old, determined grin. He was the lighthouse, she was the sea. That was their story. He just needed to be reminded, sometimes, which was which.

Backstage was a controlled chaos of last-minute preparations. The air was thick with the scent of aerosol adhesives and overheated electronics. Dancers stretched in silent, focused bubbles while their support crews made frantic adjustments to costumes. The sleek Chandrilan pair, Valerius and Lyra, stood apart from everyone, meditating with an air of supreme confidence. Aela and Ewan were drawn third in the running order. The first two pairs, a precise Zeltron duo and a powerfully athletic Zabrak couple, performed technically impressive routines that earned polite applause from the massive, shadowy audience and solid, respectable scores from the panel of five stern-faced judges who sat on a raised dais. The judges’ critiques, broadcast on screens around the arena, were full of dry, technical jargon about extension, frame, and synchronicity.

Then it was their turn. As they walked towards the centre of the vast Alderaanian floor, a hush fell over the arena. Aela felt a thousand different currents in the Force: curiosity, skepticism, hope, boredom. In the front rows, she could sense the smug certainty of Valerius and the cold, assessing void of Xylon Rhee. She ignored them all, focusing on one thing only: the man standing opposite her, his silver suit gleaming, his face pale but set with resolve. The opening notes of their music began—a haunting, slow melody from a lone violin, like the cry of a seabird over a lonely shore. They began to move, telling their story. Ewan was the lighthouse, steadfast and strong, his movements clean and powerful. Aela was the sea, fluid and unpredictable, swirling around him, sometimes gentle, sometimes ferocious. The music swelled, drums and electric strings kicking in, and the dance exploded into life. It was their frantic, leg-tangling fusion, the lindy hop and the Outer Rim cantina brawl, polished and perfected into a narrative.

For the audience, it was a breathtaking display. Ewan was the perfect anchor, his strength and timing on full display as he spun and lifted Aela with seemingly effortless power. Aela was a marvel, a blur of dark blue and sparkling light. She spun faster, leaped higher, and held her balances longer than seemed physically possible. During one complex lift, where Ewan threw her into the air, she seemed to hang there for a heart-stopping second, a star suspended in the night sky of the arena, before falling back into his arms perfectly on beat. The crowd, which had been reserved and polite, began to make noise. A smattering of applause grew into a wave, people leaning forward in their seats, their polite detachment forgotten. For Aela, it was a meditation. She let the Force flow, not in a crude shove or a blatant lift, but as a subtle guide. It was a whisper to her muscles, telling them to hold a fraction longer; a gentle current under her feet, allowing a spin to turn a quarter-revolution more; a deep, empathetic connection to Ewan, feeling his intent, his balance, his next step before he took it. She felt the joy and wonder blooming in the audience, a warm, rising tide in the Force, and she poured it back into the dance, creating a feedback loop of pure, unbridled emotion. When the music ended with a final, crashing crescendo and a return to the lonely violin, they were left in a dramatic pose, Aela cradled in Ewan’s arms, both of them breathing hard, the story told. For a second, there was silence. Then the Starlight Arena erupted. It wasn’t polite applause; it was a roar, a standing ovation that washed over them, a wave of genuine, heartfelt delight. Ewan’s face, split by a grin of pure, disbelieving joy, was the most beautiful thing Aela had ever seen.

Their elation was short-lived. They stood before the judges, chests heaving, as the head judge, a severe-looking woman from the Kuat ship-building dynasty, spoke. Her voice was as cold and precise as a laser scalpel. “A performance of undeniable… passion,” she said, and the word sounded like an insult. “The audience was clearly moved. However, the choreography, while energetic, lacked classical structure. Your frame was inconsistent, Mr. MacLeod, and Ms. Kenna, your extensions were often uncontrolled, sacrificing form for flamboyant effect.” The other judges nodded in agreement, adding critiques about ‘improper footwork’ and ‘a lack of refined elegance’. Their scores flashed up on the screen. 7.8, 8.1, 7.5, 8.2, 7.9. Good scores, solid scores. But not winning scores. They left the stage to a final, defiant cheer from the crowd, their faces a mask of strained politeness.

They watched from the wings as Valerius and Lyra took to the floor. Their music was a complex, mathematical symphony, and their dance was its physical incarnation. Every movement was perfect. Every line was clean, every turn executed with flawless precision. There was no joy in it, no passion, no story. It was a stunning, cold, technical demonstration of two bodies moving in perfect, robotic harmony. It was, Aela thought, an instruction manual. The arena was quiet, appreciative in the way one appreciates a complex piece of machinery. When they finished, the applause was respectful, but a pale shadow of the roar Aela and Ewan had received. The judges, however, were rapturous. “Perfection!” the head judge declared. “The absolute pinnacle of the form. A masterclass in technique and control.” The scores came up: 9.9, 10, 9.8, 9.9, 10. They had set a bar that was, for all intents and purposes, impossible to clear.

“I told you!” Ewan hissed as they reached the relative privacy of the corridor leading back to the dressing rooms. His face was flushed with anger. “It’s a sham! ‘Uncontrolled extensions’? I’ve never seen you more controlled in your life! They don’t want dancers, they want droids! It’s fixed, Aela. They wanted the posh Chandrilans to win from the start!”

“Ewan, calm down,” Aela urged, placing a hand on his arm. His silver suit was practically vibrating with his fury. “Yelling isn’t going to change the scores. We knew this was a risk.”

“It’s not a risk, it’s a stitch-up! What’s the point in a second round if they’ve already crowned those two icicles?” He kicked a nearby wall, the soft thud of his dance shoe doing little to vent his frustration. As he seethed, the next couple, a flamboyant and much-loved Twi’lek pair known for their acrobatic flair, took the stage. Aela turned to watch them on a nearby monitor, trying to tune out Ewan’s fuming. They were magnificent, a whirlwind of colour and life. Then, halfway through their routine, during a complex aerial manoeuvre where the male dancer was supposed to catch his partner from a swing mounted to the ceiling rigging, Aela felt it. A sharp, cold, deliberate spike in the Force. It was a feeling of malicious intent, a tiny, targeted severing. At that exact moment, the female Twi’lek’s grip on the swing slipped. It wasn't a natural slip; it was as if the polished metal had suddenly become coated in frictionless ice. She cried out, her lithe body tumbling through the air. Her partner, his face a mask of horror, lunged, breaking his own fall to cushion hers. They hit the beautiful Alderaanian floor with a sickening thud. Medical droids swarmed the stage immediately. The fall wasn’t fatal, but the performance was over, and a promising career was likely ended. The official announcement later would call it a tragic accident, a freak loss of grip. But Aela knew what she had felt. It was not an accident. It was an attack. It was the cold, null-space presence of a man like Xylon Rhee, a man who didn't care who he had to break to get what he wanted. Her blood ran cold. This was no longer about winning a dance competition.The medics rushed past them, a silent, efficient team, their expressions grim. The vibrant, joyful energy of the backstage area had evaporated, replaced by a thick, fearful silence. Ewan’s anger had vanished, leaving a pale, sickened shock in its place. He stared at the monitor where the Twi’lek dancer was being carefully loaded onto a repulsor-stretcher, her partner hovering beside her, his face a mask of anguish. “My God,” Ewan whispered, his voice hoarse. “Her leg… it was twisted the wrong way. One slip. Just one slip and it’s all over.”

Aela felt a cold dread solidify in her stomach. It wasn’t just one slip. It was a push. A precise, targeted, and utterly malevolent nudge from the dark. She closed her eyes, casting her senses back to the moment of the fall. She replayed the feeling: that sharp, cold spike of will, like a needle of ice plunged into the warm flow of the Force. It was sterile and purposeful, and it reeked of the same calculated void she’d felt from Xylon Rhee. He hadn’t just been offering a bet; he’d been ensuring its outcome. The Twi’lek pair were crowd favourites, wildcards whose passionate performances could sway an audience and, potentially, even the stubbornest judges. With them gone, the field was narrower, the outcome more predictable. More profitable.

A competition official with a datapad hurried past, his face tight. “Dancers Vesh and Ryla have withdrawn due to injury,” he announced to the remaining competitors in a flat, emotionless tone. “The final round will proceed as scheduled in twenty minutes with the four remaining pairs. Prepare yourselves.” As he walked away, Aela caught the eye of Valerius. The Chandrilan dancer’s face was a mask of placid indifference, but Aela felt a flicker of something from him in the Force—not surprise or shock, but a cold, satisfied confirmation. He knew. He was either a part of it, or he was a willing beneficiary of the crime. They were all trapped on a stage far more dangerous than they had ever imagined.

Back in their small, private dressing room, the air was suffocating. Ewan slumped onto a bench, his silver suit suddenly looking like a clown’s costume in the harsh lighting. He buried his face in his hands. “I can’t do it, Aela. I can’t go back out there. It feels… wrong. Ghoulish. We’re dancing while Ryla is on her way to a medbay, her career probably over.”

Aela knelt in front of him, waiting until he looked up. His eyes were shadowed with despair. She couldn’t tell him about the Force, about the deliberate malice she had felt, about the dark void that wore a handsome face and a velvet suit. He would think she was crazy. She had to translate the truth into a language he could understand. “It wasn’t an accident, Ewan,” she said, her voice low and intense.

He stared at her, his brow furrowed in confusion. “What are you talking about? We all saw it. She slipped.”

“Did she?” Aela leaned closer, her gaze holding his. “They’re one of the best acrobatic pairs in the sector. They’ve done that move a thousand times. The grip on that swing is resin-coated. You don’t just slip. Not like that.” She took a breath, choosing her words carefully. “Remember Xylon Rhee? The man who was so interested in the odds? The man who praised our ‘passion’ but looked at us like we were assets on a ledger? Think about it. The Twi’leks were the other fan favourites. The other wildcards. With them gone, who does it benefit? The ‘perfect’, predictable pair with the almost-perfect scores. The safe bet.”

The gears turned behind Ewan’s eyes, his dancer’s intuition for timing and momentum applying itself to the situation. His shock began to curdle back into anger, but this time it was a different kind. It was cold and focused. “You think Rhee… you think someone sabotaged them? To fix the final?” The idea was monstrous, but it fit the chilling pieces together. The cold ambition of the Chandrilans, the predatory charm of the gambler, the impossible ‘accident’. It clicked into place with a horrifying logic.

“I don’t think it, I know it,” she said, the conviction in her voice absolute. “I can’t explain how I know, Ewan. You just have to trust me. The way you trust me not to fall when you throw me in the air. I’m telling you, that floor out there isn’t just a stage anymore. It’s a crime scene.”

Ewan looked from her fiercely earnest face towards the door, as if he could see the gleaming, tainted dance floor through it. All the fight hadn’t gone out of him; it had just been knocked sideways. Now, Aela watched as it surged back, a tide of pure, righteous fury. This was an injustice he could understand. This wasn't about the subjective whims of judges; it was about cheating. It was about violence masquerading as competition. “The bastards,” he breathed, the words a low growl. He stood up, his posture changing. The slump was gone, replaced by a coiled tension. The despair in his eyes had hardened into steel. “They want us to be scared. They want us to quit, or dance badly, so their precious mannequins can have a clean win.” He looked at Aela, a new and dangerous light in his eyes. “So what do we do?”

“We dance,” Aela said, standing to face him. Her own resolve was absolute. This was her test. Not of discipline, but of purpose. Her Master had warned her of the line between bringing light and seeking a spotlight. Now, the spotlight itself was a place of darkness, and it was her duty to ignite a flame in the centre of it. “We don’t dance for the judges. We don’t even dance for Aberdeen anymore. We dance for Vesh and Ryla. We dance for everyone who thinks art can be broken and passion can be bought. We go out there and we don’t just perform our routine. We tear a hole in the sky. We show them what real connection, real heart, looks like. We make them feel it so powerfully that their numbers and their schemes fall apart into dust.”

A wild grin spread across Ewan’s face, a fierce, almost feral expression of Aberdonian defiance. This was a fight he was born for. “Aye,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “Aye, alright, Kenna. Let’s go give them hell.” He held out his hand, and she took it. His grip was firm, his palm sweaty but strong. In that moment, they weren’t just dance partners. They were comrades, soldiers in a silent war, and the dance floor was their battlefield.## Chapter 4

When their names were called for the final time, they walked into the light not as nervous hopefuls, but as executioners. The vast Starlight Arena felt different now, its grandeur tainted by the invisible crime that stained its beautiful floor. The polite, expectant hush from the audience was gone, replaced by a nervous, sympathetic murmur that rippled through the stands. The fall of the Twi’lek couple had broken the spell of the competition, reminding everyone that beneath the glitter and polish, these were fragile, human bodies at risk. Aela felt the collective apprehension as a low, anxious hum in the Force. She met Ewan’s eyes. His jaw was set, his knuckles white where he gripped her hand. He gave her a short, sharp nod. Let’s go give them hell.

Their music began again, the same lonely violin cry. But this time, it didn’t sound sad; it sounded defiant. It was the sound of a single voice singing in the dark. As they began to move, Aela made a choice. It was a choice that went against years of training, a violation of the Jedi’s first rule of secrecy. She wouldn’t just use the Force to guide her body. She would use her body as a conduit for the Force. She opened the floodgates of her own raw emotion—her fury at the injustice, her fierce love for her partner, her defiant pride in their origins—and pushed it outwards, weaving it into the very fabric of their performance. It was no longer a dance for the eyes, but for the soul.

The change was instantaneous and electric. It wasn't a mind trick; it was a broadcast of pure, unadulterated feeling. In the front rows, patrons who had been coolly assessing the performance suddenly felt a prickle of righteous anger, though they didn't know why. Up in the cheaper seats, people who had only felt a distant pity for the injured Twi'leks now felt a sharp, personal sting of injustice. They felt the cold granite of Aberdeen, the lash of the North Sea wind, the stubborn, unyielding pride of a people who refused to be broken. They didn't just see a story about a lighthouse and the sea; they felt the terror of the storm and the fierce, unwavering hope of the light. Ewan, oblivious to the Force but perfectly attuned to Aela, felt the shift as a surge of raw power. He matched her intensity, his movements becoming sharper, stronger, more ferociously precise. His anger was no longer a simmering rage but a forge fire, channeled into every lift, every turn, every powerful stomp that made the Alderaanian timber ring like a bell.

They were a storm on the stage. The impossible moves became breathtakingly so. When he threw her, she didn't just hang in the air for a second; she hovered, her body arrested in a perfect, horizontal line for a full two heartbeats, a moment of such blatant physical impossibility that a collective gasp rippled through the arena. It was a miracle hiding in plain sight, so audacious that the mind struggled to accept what the eyes were seeing. Aela risked a glance towards the judges. Their severe, professional faces were gone. They looked bewildered, their datapads forgotten in their laps, their mouths slightly agape. Their world of numbers and technicalities was being torn apart by a performance that defied quantification. On the sidelines, she felt the shockwave hit the other competitors. Valerius and Lyra were no longer watching with cool detachment. Their perfect postures had slackened, and their faces, for the first time, showed an emotion other than pride: fear. They were feeling the raw, messy, powerful emotion of the crowd, and it terrified them.

With her senses, Aela sought out the void in the Force. She found him. Xylon Rhee, sitting in a private box, his charming smile gone, replaced by a mask of cold fury. He was losing control. The crowd was no longer a passive group of consumers; they were a single, roaring entity, united in a shared feeling he could not manipulate or buy. Aela focused her will, not as an attack, but as an accusation. She let him feel her awareness, a single, bright point of light that found him in his shadowed box and held him there. She let him know that she knew. He couldn't hide in the darkness when she was shining a star directly upon him.

The music reached its final, soaring crescendo. This was it. The routine called for them to end in their starting pose, a quiet conclusion. But quiet was no longer an option. Aela broke form, her eyes locking with Ewan’s, a silent, wild communication passing between them. *Trust me.* She pushed off from him, leading him into a final, unplanned, catastrophic throw. He responded instantly, putting every ounce of his strength and frustration into launching her skyward. She didn't just leap. She flew. For a glorious, impossible three seconds, she soared in a slow, graceful arc over the centre of the stage, turning once, twice, a midnight comet in a universe of her own making. The laws of physics had been repealed. It was magic. It was a confession. It was the most beautiful, dangerous truth she had ever told. She landed without a sound, as soft as a snowflake on water, falling into her final pose one second before the last note of the violin faded into silence.

The Starlight Arena held its breath. The silence that followed was not empty. It was dense, sacred, packed with the weight of a thousand people who had just witnessed something they knew, on a cellular level, was impossible. It stretched for one second. Two. Three. Then, the silence shattered. It was not a roar; it was a detonation. The entire arena exploded onto its feet, a single, unified wave of sound and motion. It was applause, it was shouting, it was a primal scream of catharsis and wonder. They were not cheering for a dance; they were cheering for the defiance of limits, for the triumph of spirit over calculation, for the two impossible children from the edge of the galaxy who had torn a hole in the sky. On the stage, bathed in light, Ewan stared at Aela, his face a mess of sweat, tears, and utter, bewildered adoration. He didn't know how she had done it. He only knew that he had just held a star in his hands.The roar from the arena was a physical force, a tidal wave of sound that seemed to shake the very foundations of the Starlight Spire. On the dais, the judges were in disarray. Their datapads, with their neat columns for scores and technical demerits, lay dark and forgotten. They stared at the two dancers on the floor, then at the roaring, stomping, weeping audience, their faces a mixture of professional outrage and undisguised awe. The head judge, the woman from Kuat whose entire life had been a study in structure and order, looked as if her most fundamental beliefs had been disproven before her eyes.

Ewan turned to Aela, his face slick with sweat, his silver suit clinging to him. The adoration in his eyes was mixed with a profound, soul-shaking confusion. “Kenna,” he whispered, his voice lost in the thunderous applause, though she heard it as clearly as if he’d shouted in a silent room. “How… how did you do that?”

She couldn’t answer. She could only shake her head slightly, her heart pounding with a terrifying cocktail of triumph and dread. The Force was still singing through her, a wild, joyful, and utterly unsanctioned symphony. She had not just walked a razor's edge; she had leaped from the cliff, trusting that something would catch her. In the chaotic swirl of the Force, she felt a sharp, cold sting: Xylon Rhee’s presence abruptly vanishing. He wasn't just leaving the arena; he was fleeing, a predator retreating into the shadows, his plans in ruins. She had made a powerful enemy.

The head judge rose to her feet, holding up a hand for silence. The roar of the crowd subsided, reluctantly, into an expectant, simmering hum. She looked not at her fellow judges, but directly at Aela and Ewan. Her voice, when it came, was broadcast throughout the arena, stripped of its earlier coldness, now bearing a tremor of profound bewilderment.

“The Northern Lights Galactic Dance-Off is a competition of technical excellence,” she began, her voice tight. “We judge form, precision, and adherence to established classical structures.” A low boo rumbled through the audience, a warning against the verdict they feared was coming. The judge held her hand up again. “For decades, these metrics have been sufficient. Today… they are not.”

She took a deep breath, a flicker of something human and vulnerable crossing her severe features. “There is no score for what we have just witnessed. There is no category for a performance that defies the laws of physics. There is no metric that can measure a dance that makes ten thousand people feel as though their hearts might break and soar all at once.”

She looked over at Valerius and Lyra, who stood frozen on the sidelines, their perfect faces pale with shock. “The Chandrilan pair achieved a near-perfect score. By the rules of this competition, they are the technical victors.” The booing started again, louder this time. The judge silenced it with a sharp glare. “However,” she continued, her voice ringing with newfound authority, “there are moments when the rules become secondary to the truth. And the truth, which every person in this arena felt, is that the spirit of the dance does not live in perfection. It lives in passion. In connection. In the telling of a story that reminds us we are alive.”

She turned back to Aela and Ewan. “Therefore, exercising the rarely invoked ‘Chairman’s Prerogative,’ I am nullifying the scores for the final round.” A collective gasp went through the arena, followed by an explosion of cheers. Valerius looked as if he’d been struck. “The winner of this year’s Northern Lights Galactic Dance-Off will not be decided by points. It will be decided by acclamation. By what we saw. By what we felt.” She paused, letting the weight of her words settle. “The winners… are Aela Kenna and Ewan MacLeod of Aberdeen.”

The sound that erupted was not of victory, but of vindication. It was a roar of approval for the judge’s courage as much as for the dancers’ performance. Confetti cannons boomed, filling the air with glittering silver and blue streamers. Officials rushed the stage with a large, ornate trophy made of polished obsidian and starlight crystal. Ewan grabbed Aela, lifting her off her feet in a spinning hug that was a perfect echo of their first celebration in the Beach Ballroom, only this time it was in front of ten thousand screaming people and broadcast across half the sector. He was shouting something in her ear, a raw, joyful, incoherent string of Aberdonian superlatives, and Aela laughed, a real, uninhibited laugh that was tinged with the wild relief of survival. They had done it. They had given them hell. And they had won.

Later, much later, the door to their suite hissed shut, sealing them in a cocoon of sudden, deafening silence. The trophy sat on the central table, its crystalline structure catching the light from the star-filled window, scattering tiny rainbows across the white walls. The raucous after-party, the back-slapping congratulations from strangers, the babble of the holonews interviews—it all felt a million miles away. Ewan had finally taken off his jacket, draping the damp, sequined garment over a chair. He sank onto the sofa, his body finally admitting its exhaustion. He stared at the trophy for a long moment, then looked at Aela. She was still in her midnight-blue dress, standing by the vast window, her back to him, looking out at the cosmos.

“You still haven’t told me,” he said, his voice quiet, stripped of all bravado. The question didn’t need to be repeated. *How?*

Aela didn’t turn around. She felt the weight of her secret, of her entire life, pressing down on her. The joy of their victory was already being overshadowed by the inevitable reckoning. The Order preached connection, but it also demanded secrecy. To tell him would be to endanger him, to draw him into a world of hidden wars and ancient enemies. To not tell him would be to betray the most fundamental part of their partnership: their absolute, unconditional trust. He had trusted her with his life on that floor. He deserved the truth.

“Come here,” she said softly. He rose and came to stand beside her at the window. Below them, the Earth—or a planet so like it—was a swirl of white cloud and blue ocean. “You know the stories,” she began, her voice barely a whisper. “The old stories. About the Jedi.”

Ewan frowned. “Sure. The laser-sword monks who fought in the Clone Wars. Ancient history. Kids’ tales.”

“They’re not just tales,” she said. She turned to face him, her eyes dark and serious in the dim light. “The Order was scattered, destroyed. But not all of us were killed. Some survived. Some went into hiding, waiting. And some of us… were born later. With the same gifts.” She held out her hand, palm up, between them. “The Force isn’t a myth, Ewan. It’s a real, living thing. It flows through everything. It’s the rhythm that sings in the bones of a city. It’s what connects a dancer to the floor, to their partner, to the music. It’s what connects all living things.”

He stared at her hand, then back at her face, his expression a mixture of confusion and dawning, incredulous belief. He was a practical man, a man of muscle and timing and things he could touch. But he had also just witnessed a miracle. He had been a part of it.

To bridge the final gap of his disbelief, Aela reached out. She didn’t lift a rock or summon a tool. She did something far more intimate. She let him feel it. Gently, she reached into his mind with the Force, not to read his thoughts, but to share her own feelings: her anxiety and fear before the final dance, the cold spike of malice she felt when the Twi’leks fell, the soaring, defiant joy of their flight, and the deep, unwavering affection and trust she had for him. It was their entire journey, their entire friendship, condensed into a single, silent moment of perfect, empathetic connection.

Ewan stumbled back a step, his eyes wide, a hand coming up to his chest as if he’d felt a physical blow. He wasn't seeing a vision; he was feeling her truth directly. “That… that was…” he stammered, unable to find the words. He looked from her face to her outstretched hand. He finally understood. The impossible stamina. The uncanny intuition. The way she seemed to know his next move before he did. The way she hung in the air. It wasn’t a trick of balance. It was a secret weapon, and it had a name.

“You’re a machine, Kenna,” he’d always said. Now he knew what kind of machine. “A bloody Jedi,” he breathed, the words a statement of pure, stupefied awe. “My dance partner is a bloody Jedi.” A slow grin, shaky but real, spread across his face. He looked at the trophy, then back at her. “Well,” he said, letting out a huff of laughter. “That explains a lot, actually.”The silence that followed his pronouncement was more profound than the roar of the crowd had been. Ewan MacLeod, a man whose universe had until now consisted of floor wax, rhythm, and the quest for the perfect pint, stood in a silent hotel room a hundred thousand kilometres above his home planet and processed the fact that his dance partner was a mythological warrior monk. He ran a hand through his sandy hair, looked at the glittering trophy, then back at her, a slow, bewildered smile spreading across his face.

“Right,” he said, the single word carrying a universe of meaning. He pointed a finger at her. “The landing from the double-throw in the semis. The one where I nearly put you through the floor and you landed like a feather. That was you… Jedi-ing it?” Aela gave a small, sheepish nod. “And the time I slipped on that spilled drink at the Caird Hall in Dundee, and you managed to spin out of the fall and into a dip without breaking my nose?” Another nod. Ewan slapped his own forehead with the palm of his hand. “Of course! I thought you just had the balance of a cat that’s been genetically engineered by ninjas. This makes so much more sense. And so much less.”

He flopped back onto the sofa, his brain clearly working overtime to recalibrate his entire reality. “So, all that stuff you do… feeling my next move, the mad stamina… that’s all this… Force?” Aela finally moved from the window, crossing the room to sit in the chair opposite him. “It’s a connection, Ewan. To everything. Including you. When we dance, I’m not reading your mind, I’m just… listening to the music we make together. My half and your half.” Ewan’s eyes lit up with a mischievous, scientific curiosity. “Okay. Okay. So, can you… you know…” He gestured vaguely at the trophy on the table. “Whoosh it over here? With your mind?”

Aela couldn't help but laugh, a genuine laugh that eased the tension in the room. “It doesn’t really work like that. It’s not a muscle for lifting things. It’s more of a… a partnership. I can’t just command it to do things. I have to be in harmony with it.” She picked up a small, purple, explosive-looking fruit from the welcome basket. “It’s easier with things that are… familiar.” She closed her eyes, and for a moment, nothing happened. Then, the fruit trembled, lifted an inch from her palm, and wobbled in the air between them for a few seconds before plopping back into her hand. Ewan’s jaw dropped. He looked at the fruit, then at her, his eyes as wide as saucers. “Bloody hell, Kenna,” he whispered. “We could have cleaned up at the pub quiz.”

The levity of the moment, however, was fragile. Aela’s smile faded as she set the fruit down. “Ewan, what I did out there… the final leap… that was more than just a little nudge. That was a shout in a library. People will have seen it. Not just people in the audience, but… other people. People who look for things like that.” She didn’t need to name them. The shadow of Xylon Rhee and the fate of the Twi’lek dancers hung between them. “And I broke a lot of rules tonight. My own rules. I might have put you in danger.” Ewan’s playful expression vanished, replaced by the same fierce loyalty she’d seen before the final dance. He leaned forward, his gaze intense. “Hey. No. *We* put *us* in danger. We did that together. You’re the one with the magic powers, aye, but I’m the one who threw you. If anyone comes looking for a fight, they’ll have to get through me first. I may not have a laser sword, but I’ve got a head like a granite block and I know how to use it.” He reached across the table and took her hand. “You and me, Kenna. We’re a team. That hasn’t changed.”

Their departure from the Starlight Spire was a chaotic affair. They were no longer the odd pair from the Granite City; they were galactic celebrities, the giant-killers who had dethroned the favourites with a performance that was already the stuff of legend. Holo-journalists swarmed them in the terminal, shouting questions. “Ms. Kenna, the final jump! Analysts on HoloNet Sports are saying it’s a biomechanical impossibility! What’s your secret?” “Mr. MacLeod, was that final move planned?” “Is it true you’re bringing a new, raw, Outer Rim style to the galactic stage?” Ewan, stepping naturally into the role of protector, fielded all of it with a gruff, disarming charm. “The secret’s a healthy diet of rowies and Irn-Bru!” he’d bellow. “And years of practice! The lass is just built different! Now, if you’ll excuse us, we’ve got a shuttle to catch, we’re gasping for a decent cup of tea.” He bulldozed a path through the media scrum, his arm protectively around Aela, shielding her from the invasive holocams and the prying questions she couldn’t possibly answer. As they boarded the shuttle, Aela saw a newsfeed on a large public screen. It showed their final leap on a continuous loop, with commentators drawing trajectory lines and freeze-framing the moment of impossible stillness at its apex. They’d already given it a name: “The Spire Leap.”

The return to Aberdeen was a return to sanity. As their transport descended through the familiar, thick blanket of grey cloud, the frantic, high-tech hum of the Spire was replaced by the low rumble of the engines and the drumming of rain against the viewport. When the shuttle doors hissed open at the interplanetary port, the first thing that hit them was the bracing, beloved smell of salt, fish, and damp earth. A small crowd had gathered to meet them, not of journalists, but of friends and neighbours and the students from Ewan’s dance classes. They held up hand-drawn signs that read “WELCOME HOME CHAMPS!” and “THE GRANITE CITY’S ASTRODANCERS.” The fish merchant who had sponsored them was there, as was the old woman from the fabric shop, her wrinkled face beaming with pride. There was no talk of biomechanics or impossible physics, only a chorus of warm, thick accents shouting, “Well done, lad!” and “You showed them, quinie!” As Ewan was swept up in a wave of back-pats and handshakes, Aela felt a profound sense of relief. This was real. This was home. This was what they had been fighting for.

That evening, after escaping the impromptu celebration at The Prince of Wales, Aela sat in the quiet of her own small flat. The trophy sat on her coffee table, looking absurdly grand next to a chipped mug and a stack of old books. The city lights cast a soft, orange glow on the ceiling, and the familiar sound of a distant siren and the cry of gulls were a comforting balm. The excitement had passed, leaving behind a deep, bone-weary exhaustion and the quiet hum of apprehension. She knew she couldn’t delay it any longer. She pulled the silver holoprojector from her pocket, keyed in the secure frequency, and waited. The serene, lined face of Master T’kora coalesced in the dim light of her living room. Her expression was unreadable.

“I have seen the broadcasts, Aela,” the Togruta master said, her voice calm, but with an edge of tempered steel. There was no congratulations.

“Master, I can explain—”

“Can you?” Master T’kora interrupted, her voice still quiet, but sharp. “Can you explain why you chose the most public stage in the Northern Sector to perform a feat that has not been seen outside our Order in a century? I felt the shockwave of it halfway across the galaxy. You did not simply bring light, as you so poetically argued. You detonated a sun. You have painted a target on your back, my former Padawan. And on the back of your friend.”

Guilt and defiance warred in Aela’s chest. “They cheated, Master,” she said, her voice low but firm. “They used the dark side to injure another competitor. They corrupted the competition. I couldn’t let that stand. I did what I had to do to bring the truth to light.”

“There are other ways to expose corruption than to expose yourself,” Master T’kora countered. “Vigilance. Patience. Discretion. These are our shields. You cast them aside for a moment of public spectacle. Pride is a swift path, Aela, and you are running down it at full speed.”

“It wasn’t pride!” Aela insisted, the Scots lilt creeping into her voice with her passion. “It was justice! What was I to do? Let the darkness win? Let them break people and get away with it because I was afraid of being seen?”

Master T’kora was silent for a long moment, her deep gaze seeming to pierce right through Aela. “Your heart is in the right place, Aela Kenna. It always has been. That is your strength, and your greatest vulnerability.” Her expression softened with a flicker of deep concern. “But you are naive to the consequences. The man you thwarted, this Xylon Rhee, is a minor annoyance. He is a symptom of a sickness. The people you have truly alerted are far more dangerous. The ‘Spire Leap’ is now a galactic curiosity. It will be studied. Not just by sports analysts, but by those who remember the old ways. Those who hunt us.” The Master’s voice dropped to a near whisper. “The Empire fell, but some of its evils endured. There are still those who serve the memory of the Sith, who call themselves Inquisitors. They scour the galaxy for echoes in the Force, for children with potential, for survivors who grow careless. You are no longer an echo, Aela. You are a shout. And they will have heard you.”

The cold reality of her master’s words extinguished the last warm embers of Aela’s victory. The distant cry of a gull suddenly sounded like a scream of warning. “What… what should I do?” she asked, her voice small.

“For now, nothing,” Master T’kora said. “Be still. Be quiet. Return to your life. Pray the attention fades and they dismiss it as a trick of the light, a hoax. But be vigilant. Watch the shadows. Feel the currents. The Force will warn you if they draw near.” The blue image flickered. “You chose this path, Aela. You chose to dance in the light. Now you must learn to survive the things that light attracts. May the Force be with you.” The hologram vanished, leaving Aela alone in her living room, the trophy gleaming like a cold, silent accusation. The biggest fight of her life, she realised, hadn’t been on the dance floor. It was just beginning.## Chapter 5

Weeks turned into a month, and the frenetic energy of their victory slowly settled into the familiar, damp rhythm of Aberdeen life. They were local legends. The Spire Leap was a pub quiz answer, and their faces smiled out from the front page of the local paper, framed behind the bar at The Prince of Wales. The prize money, a sum that felt astronomical, had been put to sensible use. Ewan had finally paid to have the Beach Ballroom’s ancient heating system properly fixed, and the floorboards were professionally sanded and re-varnished, their friendly groans muted into a contented sigh. He’d even bought a small, struggling dance studio downtown, expanding his classes and offering free lessons to kids who couldn’t afford them. For Aela, it meant no more worrying about rent. She found a quiet top-floor flat in Old Aberdeen, its windows looking out over the winding cobbled streets and the twin spires of St Machar's Cathedral, a place of stone and history that felt as solid and real as the Jedi code.

On the surface, life was better than ever. But a subtle tension now underpinned their easy partnership. Ewan, armed with a dangerous amount of new information and a bottomless well of misguided enthusiasm, had appointed himself Aela’s unofficial guardian and Jedi researcher. He’d acquired a second-hand datapad and spent his evenings poring over heavily-redacted Imperial-era histories and fringe conspiracy holos about the Jedi Purge. His questions were clumsy, earnest, and often absurd. “So, when a haddock dies,” he’d asked one afternoon while they were stretching, “do you feel its wee soul departing for the great fish-fry in the sky?” Aela had laughed, but the questions highlighted the unbridgeable gap between them. For him, the Force was a fascinating, newly discovered science. For her, it was the very essence of her being, a sacred trust now mingled with a deep, abiding fear. The joy of sharing her secret was tempered by the weight of his new-found knowledge. He saw her now not just as Kenna, his partner, but as a Jedi, a fragile relic to be protected, and the thought terrified her more than any Inquisitor.

The first warning came on a Tuesday, during a rare spell of bright, North Sea sunshine. Aela was walking along the promenade, enjoying the salty air and the familiar cry of the gulls. She reached out with the Force, as she always did, letting the vibrant, chaotic symphony of the city wash over her: the happy shouts of children, the grumbling of tired workers, the low thrum of ship engines in the harbour. But then she felt it. A discordant note. It was a pocket of silence, a patch of cold static in the warm, living broadcast of the city. It was centered somewhere near the grey stone docks, a feeling of utter nullity, like a dead pixel on a vibrant screen. It was so alien, so utterly devoid of life and emotion, that it made the back of her teeth ache. It vanished as quickly as it appeared, a fleeting shadow, but it left her shivering in the bright sunlight, the ice cream she’d been eating suddenly tasteless in her mouth.

She tried to dismiss it as a fluke, a lingering paranoia from Master T’kora’s warning. But it happened again a few days later, a brief flash of cold emptiness near the granite facade of Marischal College. And again, a week after that, in the bustling crowds of the Union Street market. It was a ghost, a hunter on the periphery of her senses, and its presence began to fray her nerves. The easy calm she projected, the serene mask she had perfected over years of training, started to slip. She became quiet, her eyes constantly scanning the crowds, her body coiled with a tension that had nothing to do with dance. Ewan, who could read her moods better than any text, noticed immediately. “Alright, Kenna,” he said one evening as they were closing up the new studio. “You’ve got that look again. The one that says you’re contemplating the heat death of the universe. Only this time, it looks like it’s staring back at you. What’s wrong?” She hesitated, hating to burden him further, but the secret was too heavy to carry alone. She told him about the cold spots, the feeling of being watched by a void. His face, usually so open and expressive, hardened into a grim mask of protective anger. He didn't understand the mechanics of it, but he understood the threat.

They became a two-person counter-intelligence agency. Aela was the early warning system, her senses tuned to the invisible world, while Ewan became the man on the ground. His local fame was now their greatest asset. No one thought twice about Ewan MacLeod, the friendly local dance champ, stopping for a chat. He’d lean on the bar at the Fittie pubs, talking to trawlermen about the price of cod and casually asking if they’d seen any strange vessels. He’d gossip with the market traders while buying his vegetables, asking about any new faces, any quiet, intense strangers who didn’t fit the usual tourist profile. He was looking for the source of a feeling, a man-shaped hole in the city’s fabric, and he pursued the task with the same relentless tenacity he applied to mastering a new dance step. For weeks, he found nothing but friendly gossip and wild speculation. Then, he got a hit. A barman at the Ship Inn, a dark, wood-panelled pub frequented by dock workers, mentioned a man. A quiet southerner, maybe, with a crisp accent. Dressed in drab grey, asked odd questions. Not about the oil rigs or the football, but about the city’s history. About folklore. About “unexplained events” and “people with uncanny abilities.” He’d been particularly interested in the story of the Spire Leap. The description was chillingly vague, but the pattern was undeniable.

That night, Aela knew she couldn’t wait for the shadow to come to her. Following Master T’kora’s advice to ‘be vigilant’ felt passive, like waiting for a predator to strike. She had to find the source of the cold. Leaving Ewan with a promise to be careful, she walked to the harbour, pulling the collar of her jacket up against the biting wind. The pub was busy, a loud, warm haven against the cold night, but she didn’t go inside. She stood across the cobbled street, closed her eyes, and reached out. The boisterous energy of the pub-goers was a roaring fire in the Force, but she sifted through it, searching for the cold trail, the lingering psychic residue of the man who did not belong. She found it. A faint, icy slick on the vibrant tapestry of the city. It led away from the pub, down a narrow, winding alley paved with ancient, uneven stones, the air thick with the smell of brine and stale beer. It was the kind of dark, forgotten lane she had once used for private conversations. The feeling grew stronger, the cold more intense. He was close.

She stepped into the alley, and the noise of the street immediately fell away, replaced by the moan of the wind and the distant clang of a ship’s bell. The cold was a palpable presence now, a knot of absolute zero at the far end of the lane. A figure detached itself from the deeper shadows beneath a crumbling stone archway. He wasn’t large or physically intimidating, a man of average height and build in a simple, dark grey, high-collared tunic. He could have been a minor port official or a guild inspector. But his face was gaunt and pale, and his eyes, which seemed to catch the dim light and reflect nothing, were ancient and pitiless. The void in the Force emanated from him like a freezing aura. He held up a small, cylindrical silver device that hummed with a low, discordant energy. It was a Force detector, far more sensitive than anything the old Republic had used.

“Aela Kenna,” the man said. His voice was flat, without accent or inflection, like a computer synthesising speech. “Your energy signature is… irregular. Unregistered. A significant anomaly in an otherwise dormant sector.” He wasn’t accusing her; he was classifying her, like a biologist identifying a specimen. “I am designated Seeker 7. My function is to investigate such anomalies. To identify and catalogue the lost children of the Order.” He took a slow step forward, his lack of overt aggression more terrifying than any drawn weapon. “The Emperor’s great work of purification is not yet complete. There are still pockets of disorder to be sanitised. You will be processed and catalogued accordingly. Your compliance is expected.”

For a heart-stopping moment, Aela was frozen. This was it. The abstract threat her master had warned of, made real in a cold-eyed man in a dark Aberdeen alley. He hadn’t drawn a weapon. He hadn't attacked. He had simply delivered a death sentence with the bland indifference of a shipping clerk. He watched her, his head tilted slightly, waiting for her reaction, for the flicker of fear or anger that would confirm his diagnosis. He wanted her to run. He wanted her to fight. He wanted her to reveal herself completely. Instead, Aela did the last thing he expected. She smiled, the same terrifying, delighted-face grin she’d given Ewan in the ballroom an eternity ago. “I think you’re in the wrong city, pal,” she said, her Aberdonian accent thick and unapologetic. “The UFO convention isn’t ‘til Tuesday. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m late for my supper.” She turned her back on him, a gesture of such profound, suicidal audacity that it momentarily disrupted his cold composure. She felt a flicker of surprise, of analytical confusion, from him in the Force. It was all the opening she needed. She didn’t run. She walked, deliberately, calmly, out of the alley and back towards the light and noise of the street, every nerve screaming, every muscle coiled to deflect a blow that never came.

She burst through the door of her flat to find Ewan pacing, his face etched with worry. “Kenna! I was about to come looking for—” He stopped when he saw her face, the false bravado stripped away, leaving only pale, stark terror. “He’s here,” she gasped, leaning against the door to catch her breath. “A Seeker. He knows who I am.” The full weight of the encounter crashed down on her. The Seeker hadn't attacked because he hadn't needed to. This wasn't a fight; it was a summons. He had marked his quarry, and now the true hunters would come. Ewan rushed to her side, his hands on her arms. “What happened? Did he hurt you?” “No,” she said, her voice shaking. “He just… talked. But it’s over, Ewan. Being quiet, hiding… it’s not an option anymore.” Her gaze fell on the Spire trophy, gleaming on her coffee table. It wasn’t a symbol of victory. It was a beacon. A beacon that had guided the darkness right to their door. “Aberdeen isn’t safe,” she said, her voice dropping to a whisper of grim finality. “We have to run.”## Chapter 6

Ewan didn’t panic. The raw terror on Aela’s face was so absolute that it shocked him straight past fear and into a state of pure, functional clarity. He processed her words, “We have to run,” not as a cry of despair, but as the first step in a new routine. His dancer’s mind, accustomed to memorising complex sequences under pressure, simply slotted this new reality into place. The old steps were gone. This was the new choreography. Survival. He guided her away from the door and sat her down on the sofa, then went to the kitchen and poured her a glass of water, his movements calm and deliberate. He knelt in front of her, waiting until her shaking hands could take the glass. He didn’t ask what a Seeker was or what being processed meant. The details were irrelevant. All that mattered was the look in her eyes.

“Right,” he said, his voice a low, steady anchor in the storm of her fear. “Run where?” The simple, practical question cut through her panic. She looked up, her mind scrambling for an answer, a destination, a plan. She had been thinking only of flight, not of a landing. The hidden Jedi enclaves were scattered and secret, known to her only as coordinates in a deep memory file she was forbidden to access without direct orders. To go to one would be to endanger the last remnants of the Order. They were on their own. “Somewhere busy,” she said, her thoughts slowly coalescing. “Somewhere in the Outer Rim. A place where two more lost souls won’t be noticed. Somewhere the official channels don’t run so clean.”

They moved with a frantic, silent efficiency. Packing a life into two small bags was a brutal act of triage. Ewan was ruthlessly practical, stuffing his bag with thermal socks, credit chips, a water-purifying canteen, and a small medkit. He moved through his own flat like a whirlwind, his face grim. Aela, in her own space, was more hesitant. Every object was a memory, a tie to a life she was severing. She picked up the Spire trophy, its cold, heavy weight a perfect mirror of the guilt in her stomach. It was the source of her fame and the beacon for her hunters. Leaving it felt like an admission of defeat, but taking it felt like an act of suicidal pride. With a final, sorrowful glance, she placed it back on the coffee table, a glittering offering to the life she was leaving behind. Into her bag went only a few sets of dark, functional clothing, a worn copy of a book of Aberdonian poetry, and the small silver sphere of her holoprojector, now feeling less like a connection and more like a liability.

There could be no official transport. The Aberdeen Interplanetary Port, their gateway to the stars, was now a trap. Every passenger manifest would be scanned, every face scrutinised. Aela knew Seeker 7 would not be working alone for long. He was the scout; the hunters would follow, and they would be thorough. While she secured her meagre belongings, Ewan made one phone call, his voice low and urgent. He didn’t dial a travel agent or a booking service. He called the fish merchant, Mr. Finlay, the man whose gruff generosity had helped send them to the Spire in the first place. He kept the conversation short and vague, a desperate appeal couched in the language of old favours. He spoke of a family emergency, a sudden need to get off-world quietly, a problem with a jealous rival. It was a flimsy story, but it was rooted in a real relationship, and in the tight-knit world of the Aberdeen docks, that counted for more than logic. The answer came back after a tense minute of silence: a cargo hauler, the *Puffin’s Gamble*, was leaving at 0300 standard hours from the industrial wharf. It was carrying a full load of frozen langoustine destined for a distribution hub in the Kessel sector. The captain was a dour Rodian who valued credits over questions. It was their only shot.

There was one last stop they had to make. Ewan unlocked the door to his new studio, the words “Granite City Dance” painted proudly on the glass. They stepped inside, the air still smelling of fresh varnish and Ewan’s sweat equity. The new heating system hummed softly, a gentle warmth that fought back the North Sea chill. He walked to the centre of the floor, the floor he had so painstakingly restored, and ran his hand over its smooth, perfect surface. This place was his trophy, the tangible result of their impossible victory, a future he had been building not just for himself, but for the city’s kids. He was leaving it all behind. He looked at Aela, his face a canvas of heartbreak and resolve. “They’d better have a decent dance floor where we’re going,” he said, his attempt at a joke cracking under the weight of his sacrifice. Aela felt a pang of guilt so sharp it was like a physical blow. Her gift, her curse, had cost him his dream. “We’ll build a new one,” she promised, her voice thick with unshed tears. “A better one.”

Their final walk through Aberdeen was a funereal procession. They moved through the backstreets, avoiding the main thoroughfares, their bags slung over their shoulders. The city felt different, its familiar comfort replaced by a sense of menace lurking in every shadow. The granite buildings, usually so solid and reassuring, seemed to press in on them like the walls of a tomb. Aela kept her senses extended, a painful, wide-open net, constantly searching for the cold spot, the void of the Seeker. She felt nothing, a fact that was more terrifying than a direct pursuit. He wasn’t chasing them. He was waiting, confident that all exits were covered. The thought spurred them on, their pace quickening as they neared the harbour. The air grew thick with the smells of low tide and diesel, the sounds of rigging clanking against masts and the low thrum of ship engines idling in the dark. This was the city’s gritty heart, its unglamorous, functional core, and it was here they sought their salvation.

The rendezvous point was behind the cavernous, silent fish market. The air was eye-wateringly pungent, a miasma of old fish and seawater. Their contact emerged from the shadows between two large waste disposal units, a hulking Rodian with dull, obsidian-like eyes and a snout that twitched with suspicion. He was flanked by two burly crewmembers who looked like they’d been carved from the same granite as the city. The captain of the *Puffin’s Gamble* wasted no time on pleasantries. He grunted a greeting and named a price for their passage, a number so exorbitant it made Ewan flinch. It would take almost everything they had. There was no room for negotiation. Ewan passed over the credit chips, which the Rodian counted with a practiced flick of his thick fingers. He gave them a final, dismissive look-over. “Cargo hold. Bay 4. No trouble. You make trouble, you go out the airlock with the fish guts. Understood?” They both nodded, their faces grim. The captain grunted again and jerked his head towards a dimly lit wharf where a ship that lived up to its name sat moored, its hull a patchwork of rust and mismatched repair plates.

Stepping onto the ramp of the *Puffin’s Gamble* was like entering another world. The sterile luxury of the Starlight Express was a distant dream. Here, the air was a recycled fug of stale food, unwashed bodies, and the faint, pervasive chill of the cryo-storage. The corridors were narrow, grimy, and lit by flickering, unreliable light panels. A crewman, barely sparing them a glance, led them down a series of clanking metal ladders into the cavernous cargo hold. The vast chamber was filled with massive, humming cryo-containers, each branded with the Finlay Fisheries logo, the air around them frosting over. He pointed to a small, dark space between two of the containers. “Here. Stay here. Don’t touch anything.” He turned and left, the heavy hatch booming shut behind him, plunging them into near-total darkness, the only light coming from the status indicators on the cryo-units. They were cargo now, hidden amongst the frozen fruits of the sea.

Ewan found a relatively clean patch of floor and dropped his bag, letting out a long, slow breath. Aela remained standing, her hand braced against the cold metal of a container. A low, powerful vibration shuddered through the deck plates as the ship’s engines spooled up, followed by a lurch as the magnetic mooring clamps were released. Aela closed her eyes, reaching out one last time, a final farewell to her home. She felt the ship rise, lifting away from the solid, familiar ground of the docks. She felt the city spread out beneath them, a warm, living tapestry of light and life in the Force. And there, near the harbour, she felt it: the cold, stationary pinpoint of Seeker 7. He was standing on the shore, watching them go, his mission to catalogue her now shifting to a mission to track her. A shiver ran down her spine, but it was chased away by a surge of defiant relief. They were away. They were free, if only for a moment. As the *Puffin’s Gamble* banked and climbed through the rain-slicked clouds into the star-dusted darkness, Aela looked at Ewan, whose face was faintly illuminated by the green glow of a status panel. They were fugitives, adrift in a cold, indifferent galaxy, with nothing but two small bags and a desperate, impossible plan. But they were together. And for now, that was enough.## Chapter 7

The first few days in the belly of the *Puffin’s Gamble* were a lesson in sensory deprivation. The universe shrank to the cold, cramped space between two humming cryo-containers. The only light came from the green and red status indicators that blinked in a maddening, ceaseless rhythm, casting their faces in a sickly, alien glow. The only sound was the low, bone-deep thrum of the ship’s engines and the high-pitched whine of the refrigeration units, a mechanical symphony that vibrated through the floor plates and into their skulls. Time became a thick, formless liquid, measured only by the rumbling shift in the engine’s tone that Aela guessed was the jump to hyperspace—a transition that felt less like a lurch and more like the world being pulled inside out for a silent, stomach-turning second. They were ghosts in the machine, their existence reduced to the thin sleeping bags they unrolled on the grimy deck and the nutrient paste packs the Rodian captain begrudgingly provided, which tasted of spiced cardboard.

For Ewan, the ordeal was a physical one. He was stiff from the cold and the inability to properly stretch, and he complained bitterly about the lack of decent food. Yet, he adapted with a pragmatism that was both comforting and astonishing. He established a routine, marking the passage of their "days" by a timer on his datapad. He rationed their water, meticulously cleaned their small living space with sanitation wipes from his medkit, and insisted they go through a series of cramped, modified stretching exercises to keep their muscles from seizing up. He was the lighthouse, even here in the dark, his steadfast focus on the practicalities of survival a solid wall against the encroaching despair.

For Aela, the challenge was internal. The constant, monotonous hum of the ship was a form of white noise that made true meditation impossible. When she tried to find stillness, her mind, untethered from the familiar anchor of Aberdeen, would drift into terrifying hypotheticals. She saw Seeker 7’s blank face, the glint of his detector, the cold certainty in his voice. She felt the chill of his presence not as a memory, but as a lingering stain on the Force, a cold trail stretching out behind them through the void. Her guilt over Ewan’s sacrifice was a constant, dull ache in her chest. She watched him methodically peeling the wrapper off another nutrient bar, his face set with determination, and saw the ghost of the life she had stolen from him: his studio, his students, his future. It was a debt she could never repay.

“Try again,” Ewan whispered one "evening," his voice a low rumble in the dark. He was sitting opposite her, his eyes closed in concentration, a look of intense effort on his face. He had become obsessed with trying to feel the Force himself, convinced that if he just concentrated hard enough, he could sense the ‘music’ she always talked about. “Tell me what it feels like. Is it a buzz? A hum? Like when your foot falls asleep?” Aela sighed, a small smile touching her lips despite her anxiety. “It’s not like that, Ewan. It’s not a physical feeling. It’s… an awareness. Like knowing which way the wind is blowing without having to see the leaves move.” She reached out, not with her hand, but with her mind, and gently brushed against his consciousness. She didn't share a memory this time, just a simple feeling: the smooth, cold surface of the cryo-container behind him, the faint warmth of his own body, the empty space between them. He gasped, his eyes flying open. “I felt that,” he breathed, a look of wonder on his face. “It wasn't a thought, it was just… a knowing. For a split second. Like I’d just remembered something I already knew.” He looked at her, his eyes shining in the dim light. “You do that all the time?” “All the time,” she confirmed quietly. The wonder on his face was a brief, welcome respite from the oppressive fear that had become her constant companion.

Their precarious peace was shattered on what Ewan’s datapad declared was their fifth day. A sudden clang of boots on the metal ladder announced the arrival of the captain. Grak the Rodian descended into the hold, his snout twitching, his large, black eyes scanning the space with undisguised suspicion. One of the refrigeration units was making a new, slightly off-key whining sound, and he had come to investigate. As he moved past their hiding spot, he paused, his gaze lingering on them. “Still here,” he grunted, the words a statement of mild annoyance. He shone a harsh utility light in their faces, making them flinch. His eyes narrowed on Aela. “You. You’re quiet. Too quiet.” The Force around him was a murky, unpleasant tangle of greed and low-grade paranoia. He was a creature of simple motivations, and two quiet, desperate passengers were an unknown variable in his profitable equation.

He gestured with the light towards their meagre belongings. “What’s in the bags?” he demanded. “Just clothes. Supplies,” Ewan said quickly, his body tensing, ready to place himself between the captain and Aela. The Rodian’s gaze fell on Aela’s bag, where the spherical holoprojector made a distinct, rounded bulge in the fabric. “That’s not clothes,” Grak rasped, stepping closer. “Show me.” Aela’s blood ran cold. The projector was her only link to her master, a piece of Jedi technology that would be an undeniable confirmation of who she was. Panic flared in her chest, hot and sharp. As the Rodian reached a clawed hand for her bag, Aela acted. She didn’t push him or cloud his mind. She simply reached out with the Force and nudged the malfunctioning refrigeration unit. The slightly off-key whine suddenly escalated into a loud, grating screech, accompanied by a shower of bright, alarming sparks.

Grak swore violently in his own tongue, his attention instantly diverted from Aela’s bag to the shower of sparks threatening his precious cargo. The potential loss of profit was a far more immediate and visceral threat than two suspicious passengers. He bellowed into his wrist-comm, barking orders for an engineering crew, completely forgetting about them as he stomped over to the malfunctioning unit, kicking it furiously as if to punish the machine for its insolence. Aela and Ewan pressed themselves back into the shadows, their hearts pounding. They had survived, but the encounter was a stark reminder of their fragility. They were trapped in a metal box with a paranoid captain, light-years from any semblance of safety, their lives dependent on quick thinking and the subtle manipulation of a failing refrigeration unit.

After what felt like an eternity, the ship’s engines changed tone again, a deep, groaning shudder that signalled their exit from hyperspace. A low klaxon blared through the hold, and a tinny, automated voice announced their approach to “Scrapper’s Orbit, Kessel Sector.” The heavy cargo hatch groaned open, flooding the dark hold with a dirty, amber-coloured light and a wall of overwhelming noise. The air that rushed in was thick and acrid, smelling of ionised metal, burning fuel, and a thousand unidentifiable chemical pollutants. They scrambled up the ladder and emerged onto the docking ramp, blinking in the unfamiliar light. Their destination was not a planet or a moon, but a colossal, artificial worldlet, a chaotic, tangled mass of salvaged starships, derelict space stations, and industrial platforms all fused together in a haphazard, gravity-defying vertical slum. Lights of every colour blinked and flickered from thousands of repurposed windows and makeshift shops. Ships of every shape and size swarmed around it like insects, and the air was filled with a cacophony of warning sirens, distorted music from countless cantinas, and the roar of welding torches. It was a city built from the galaxy’s garbage. Ewan let out a low whistle, his face a mask of horrified awe. “Toto,” he whispered, his voice dry. “I’ve a feeling we’re not just out of the Granite City. I think we’ve fallen off the map entirely.”The ramp of the *Puffin’s Gamble* retracted with a final, indifferent hiss, and the rusty cargo hauler detached from the docking port, its hull melting into the smoggy, chaotic swarm of traffic. Grak the Rodian captain, who had shoved past them without a word, was already gone, their exorbitant fare a fading memory in his greedy mind. They were left standing on a wide, open-air platform greasy with spilled fuel and littered with discarded mechanical parts. The noise was a physical assault, a constant barrage of clanging metal, shouting voices in a dozen languages, screeching warning sirens, and the percussive thud of heavy machinery somewhere deep in the station’s guts. The air was a noxious cocktail that burned the back of the throat. Below them, the ‘city’ dropped away into a dizzying, vertical abyss of twisted metal and blinking lights, a coral reef built of starship carcasses. Beings of all shapes and sizes hurried past them—a grimy Wookiee hauling a massive power converter on its back, a group of chattering Jawas scavenging for loose bolts, a human with cybernetic eyes who gave them a long, predatory stare before moving on. They were aliens here in a way they never were on the pristine Starlight Spire. There, they were curiosities. Here, they were fresh meat.

Ewan instinctively pulled Aela closer, his body forming a protective shield against the jostling crowd. His face was pale, but his eyes were sharp, scanning their surroundings, assessing threats. "Right," he said, his voice raised to be heard over the din. "First things first. We need to get off this main platform. Too open. Too many eyes." He pointed towards a narrow, covered archway that looked like it was once the service corridor of a Corellian freighter. "That way. Let’s try to find somewhere a bit quieter. Someplace to think." Aela nodded, her senses overwhelmed. The Force here was a nightmare. It wasn’t a tapestry, it was a trash fire—a chaotic, sputtering, acrid mess of desperation, greed, pain, and the cold, unfeeling hum of a billion broken machines. Trying to find a single clear thought in it was like trying to hear a whisper in a foundry. Every being that brushed past them left a smear of raw, jagged emotion on her mind. She followed Ewan, keeping her head down, focusing only on the back of his jacket, letting him be her anchor in the overwhelming sensory storm.

The archway led into a labyrinth. The "streets" of Scrapper's Orbit were the repurposed interiors of dead ships, linked by rickety catwalks and crude, welded-on tunnels. They walked through the spinal corridor of a Mon Calamari cruiser, its organic curves now plastered with garish holographic advertisements for loan sharks and weapon mods. They crossed a precarious mesh bridge suspended over a chasm thousands of feet deep, the wind whistling up from the void, carrying the smell of ozone and decay. They saw people huddled in alcoves, cooking strange-smelling food over open plasma fires. Children with old, knowing eyes watched them pass, assessing the quality of their boots and the weight of their bags. There was no law here, only the physics of gravity and the unspoken rules of survival. Ewan’s hand never left the small vibro-knife he’d bought from a paranoid ex-soldier in Aberdeen and tucked into his belt. Aela, meanwhile, found her own weapon. She couldn’t meditate, can’t find clarity, but she could use the chaos. She let the jagged emotions of the crowd flow over her, learning to read the spikes of aggression, the oily slick of deceit. She felt a trio of tough-looking Gamorreans start to follow them, their intent a blunt instrument of simple greed. Before they could make a move, she steered Ewan down a side passage—a cramped ventilation shaft—and they emerged into a different section, the pig-faced thugs lost in the maze.

After what felt like hours of walking, they found a district known, according to a flickering, half-broken sign, as "The Sump." It was several levels down from the main docking bays, a grimy, dripping sector built into the fused engine rooms of several capital ships. The noise here was less chaotic, more of a constant, industrial throb. The air was thick with steam and the smell of hot oil. It was a worker’s district, populated by mechanics, welders, and droid repair specialists. It felt marginally safer, if only because everyone seemed too busy or too exhausted to be actively predatory. They found a lodging house, a tall, narrow structure that was once the command tower of a Nebulon-B frigate, now listing at a precarious angle. The proprietor was a weary-looking Sullustan with drooping jowls, who barely looked up from the greasy droid brain he’s repairing as he took their credits. He slid a single keycard across the counter. "Room 47. Back stairs. No fighting, no fires, no loud noises. Break a rule, you’re out. No refunds."

Room 47 was less a room and more a closet with a viewport. It was a converted escape pod, still smelling faintly of emergency rations and fear. There was a single hard bunk bolted to the wall and a floor space barely big enough for their two bags. But the door had a solid, magnetic lock, and the viewport, though streaked with grime, looked out onto the breathtaking, terrifying vista of the junk-city. It was, for the first time since they left Aberdeen, a private, defensible space. Ewan immediately checked the lock, scanned the room for bugs with a cheap detector from his bag, and then slumped onto the floor, his back against the wall, the tension finally draining from him. "Home sweet home," he muttered, running a hand over his face. Aela stood at the viewport, her hand pressed against the cold transparisteel. The raw, chaotic energy of the station pressed in, but the thin wall and the solid lock provided a fragile shield. They were safe. For tonight. She looked at Ewan, at his exhausted but determined face, and the full weight of her decision settled upon her. She had brought him here, to this scrap-heap at the edge of nowhere, to a life of hiding in fear. "Ewan," she said, her voice barely a whisper. "I'm so sorry." He looked up, his expression softening. He pushed himself to his feet, came to stand beside her, and put an arm around her shoulders. "Hey. None of that," he said, his voice firm but gentle. "We're a team, remember? Besides," he added, a flicker of his old grin returning as he gestured at the sprawling metal chaos outside. "You have to admit, the view is something else. And I bet there’s a dance floor down there somewhere. We just have to find it." His unwavering optimism was a small, warm light in the vast, cold darkness, and Aela leaned against him, drawing strength from it, knowing it was the only thing she had left to hold on to.## Chapter 8

Their first "morning" in the escape pod was heralded not by a sun, but by a shift in the station's ambient lighting from a murky amber to a brighter, harsher industrial white. The illusion of safety offered by the night vanished, replaced by the stark reality of their situation. They had a locked door and four walls, but they also had dwindling credits and no friends in a city built on predatory self-interest. Ewan, ever the pragmatist, sat on the edge of the bunk and took inventory of their assets. After paying the Rodian captain and the Sullustan lodging-house owner, their funds were perilously low. “We’ve got enough for maybe two more weeks of this shoe-box and nutrient paste,” he announced, his voice grimly matter-of-fact. “We need work. And we need it yesterday.”

They ventured back out into the steam-filled corridors of The Sump, but this time with a purpose. They were no longer just passing through; they were job-seekers, a fact that made them seem both more vulnerable and less interesting to the local predators. The district was a hive of frantic, greasy industry. In open-fronted workshops, beings of a dozen species hunched over sparking machinery, their faces illuminated by the blue-white glare of welding torches. The air was a cacophony of power tools and barked orders. It was a world of specialised, hard-earned skills they simply did not possess. They were met with dismissive grunts and suspicious stares. A dancer’s core strength was useless when it came to re-calibrating a hyperdrive motivator, and a Jedi’s affinity for the Force couldn’t be listed on a resume. Desperation began to gnaw at the edges of Ewan’s composure.

It was Aela who found their first opening. They were passing a small, cluttered workshop overflowing with droid parts, run by a solitary, ancient Ugnaught mechanic who was cursing fluently at a dismantled astromech unit. A crucial-looking servo-motor had rolled from his workbench and fallen into a deep pile of metallic scrap. The Ugnaught, whose name they would learn was Knik, was too old and stout to be digging through the precarious pile himself. While Ewan tried to offer their services for manual labour and was brusquely waved off, Aela closed her eyes. She ignored the wider chaos of the station and focused on the small, contained problem. She reached out, not with a grand Force push, but with a delicate, questing tendril of awareness, sifting through the junk. She felt the cold, distinct shape of the servo, its internal mechanisms silent and still, nestled deep beneath a tangle of burnt-out wiring. “It’s there,” she said quietly, pointing to a specific spot in the pile. “Under the red cables. About half a metre down.” Knik eyed her with profound suspicion, but gestured for Ewan to look. Grumbling, Ewan dug into the scrapheap, and a minute later, emerged victorious, holding the exact part. The Ugnaught stared from the servo to Aela, his piggy eyes narrowing. He didn’t ask how she knew. In a place like Scrapper’s Orbit, you didn’t question a useful anomaly. He tossed two credit chips onto the workbench. “Payment,” he grunted. “Now get out.” It wasn’t much, but it was a start. It was proof they could survive here.

Their "knack" for finding lost parts and diagnosing unseen mechanical faults earned them a small but steady stream of odd jobs from Knik and a few other mechanics in The Sump. Aela would provide the impossible diagnosis, and Ewan, with his surprising aptitude for mimicry and quick learning, would perform the actual fix under her quiet guidance. They were a strange, efficient team. But the work was inconsistent, the pay meagre, and the suspicion from the other workers was a constant, low-grade hostility. They needed something more stable, a way to truly embed themselves in the community. Ewan found it in the one place that felt remotely familiar: a cantina. The Gilded Wrench was the closest thing The Sump had to a social hub, a large, noisy chamber carved out of a starship's primary engine room. The bar was a repurposed control console, and the tables were welded-down sections of hull plating. It was owned by a weary-looking Twi’lek woman with faded blue skin and eyes that had seen too much. She listened to Ewan’s pitch—a charming, desperate plea for any kind of work—with profound indifference. But she was also short-staffed. She agreed to take them on, not as performers, but as cleaners. For a bunk in a shared dormitory and two meals a day, they mopped up spilled drinks, scrubbed grime off the tables, and hauled heavy tubs of waste to the station’s recyclers.

It was a humbling, crushing fall from grace. The Galactic Champions, whose victory leap was still being endlessly analysed on the HoloNet, were now glorified janitors, their hands raw from harsh cleansers, their clothes perpetually smelling of stale ale and greasy food. Ewan endured it with a stoic, grim-faced acceptance, but Aela saw the light dim in his eyes. The easy grin was gone, replaced by a permanent exhaustion. He missed the music. He missed the movement. He missed the joy. One night, long after the last customer had staggered out, he stood in the centre of the empty, filthy cantina floor, a mop in his hand. A tinny, melancholic tune was drifting from the cheap sound system, a forgotten track at the end of a playlist. He looked at Aela, who was wiping down the sticky bar. “This was supposed to be our new dance floor,” he said, his voice flat and empty.

Aela put down her rag. She walked over to him, took the mop from his hands, and leaned it against a table. She took his grimy hands in hers. “It still is,” she whispered. She pulled him closer, and in the centre of the foul-smelling cantina, they began to move. There were no flashy lifts, no impossible spins. It was a simple, slow shuffle, a dance of two tired, broken people holding each other up in the dark. Aela rested her head on his shoulder, the rough fabric of his work tunic scratching her cheek. The Force, for the first time in weeks, wasn't a warning system or a tool. It was just a connection, a warm, silent current flowing between them, a conversation without words that spoke of shared loss, mutual support, and a tiny, stubborn flicker of hope. He held her tighter, his steps sure and steady, the anchor she so desperately needed. They were not performers. They were not champions. They were just two people, dancing in the ruins of their old lives, finding a small, private grace in the heart of the galaxy’s biggest scrapheap.

The dance was a quiet moment of peace, a fragile bubble in the overwhelming chaos of their new existence. For those few minutes, lost in the simple rhythm and the solid presence of her partner, Aela’s guard was down. Her senses, usually stretched wide in a net of paranoid vigilance, were focused inward, on the quiet music of their shared movement. And it was in that moment of peaceful distraction that the cold returned. It was not the vague, lingering stain she had felt before. It was a sharp, distinct pinprick. It was distant, leagues away in the vast tangle of the station, but it was clear, focused, and active. It was the psychic equivalent of a sniper chambering a round. The Seeker, or something far worse, was no longer just aware of her. It was actively hunting again. Her body went rigid in Ewan’s arms. The music in their minds died, replaced by a blaring alarm. The bubble had burst. The shadows of Scrapper's Orbit were long, and something terrible had just stepped into them.The body of Ewan MacLeod, a human metronome honed by years of lindy hop and waltzes, was Aela's anchor in the Force. When she felt the cold pinprick of the hunter, his solid frame was the first thing she clung to, a physical reality in a world that had just dissolved into pure, psychic terror. Her entire body went rigid in his arms, her breath catching in her throat. The slow, melancholic shuffle they had been sharing died instantly.

"Kenna? What is it?" Ewan’s voice was a low whisper, his hands tightening on her arms as he felt the abrupt change in her. Her face, which had been soft with a sad, gentle focus just a moment before, was now a pale, sharp-angled mask of alarm. Her eyes were unfocused, looking past him, past the grimy walls of the cantina, and out into the vast, unknowable tangle of the station. She was listening to a sound he couldn't hear, seeing a threat he couldn't perceive.

"It's here," she breathed, the words barely audible over the hum of the cantina's air scrubbers. "The cold. It's not a memory. It's active. It's hunting." She disentangled herself from his embrace, her movements quick and furtive, like a startled animal. She stumbled back a step, her senses stretching out, trying to triangulate the source of the feeling. It was still distant, somewhere in the upper levels near the main docking bays, but it was moving with a cold, deliberate purpose that made her skin crawl. It felt different from Seeker 7's sterile void. That had been the dispassionate focus of a collector. This was the hungry, patient malevolence of an executioner. This was an Inquisitor.

Ewan’s face hardened, the brief moment of shared sorrow wiped away by a surge of protective fury. He instinctively scanned the empty cantina, his eyes darting into the dark corners as if expecting an enemy to materialise from the shadows. "Where? Who?" he hissed, grabbing the mop handle and holding it like a quarterstaff, a pitifully inadequate weapon against an unseen foe.

"Not here. Not yet," Aela said, her mind racing. The Inquisitor was methodically sweeping the upper levels, a predator casting a net. They couldn't know their exact location yet, but a being that powerful could sense a Force-user's presence across the station, especially if they were agitated or afraid. Her own panic was a beacon. She forced herself to take a deep, shuddering breath, pulling her fear into a tight, shielded ball in the center of her being, trying to dim her own light in the Force. It was like trying to hide a bonfire under a blanket. "We have to move. Now. Our room is the first place they'll look if they get a lock on us."

Their exhaustion was forgotten, burned away by a fresh wave of adrenaline. They didn't even bother gathering the meagre belongings from their shared dormitory. They fled the Gilded Wrench, melting into the steam-filled, labyrinthine corridors of The Sump. The station, which had felt like a prison, now felt like their only potential salvation. Its sheer, chaotic complexity was their camouflage. Aela led the way, not with her eyes, but with her senses. She plunged them into the deepest, most crowded, and most sensorially noisy parts of the district she could find, places where the Force was a maelstrom of raw, unfiltered emotion and screeching, dying machinery. They squeezed through a throng of beings watching a high-stakes droid fight, the air thick with shouts and the smell of ozone. They scurried through the kitchens of a massive communal mess hall, the heat and clatter a physical blow. Every harsh sensation, every jagged spike of anger or pain from the beings around them, was a welcome piece of static, helping to obscure her own unique frequency.

Ewan stuck to her like a shadow, his hand resting on the vibro-knife at his belt, his eyes constantly scanning, his head on a swivel. He was completely out of his depth, fighting an enemy he couldn't see, in a war he couldn't comprehend, but his trust in her was absolute. He didn’t question her sudden turns down dark, dripping service tunnels or her decision to hide for ten minutes in the shadow of a massive, sparking capacitor bank. He just followed, his presence a solid, reassuring weight at her back.

From the relative cover of a crowded marketplace, Aela risked another probe, a delicate extension of her senses. The cold presence was closer now, descending through the levels of the station. The Inquisitor was moving with an unnatural speed and confidence, cutting through the labyrinth as if following a map. And he was. He wasn't just sensing her; Aela realised with a jolt of horror that he was likely tracking the signature of her holoprojector. The device, her last link to the Order, was a tracking beacon leading the wolves right to her door. And she had left it in her bag, in the dormitory of the cantina. The Inquisitor was heading straight for their last known location. He would find their former co-workers. He would find their former landlord. And the people of Scrapper’s Orbit were not known for their loyalty in the face of powerful, intimidating strangers. Someone would talk. They had to get off the station.

"The *Puffin's Gamble*," Ewan said, his mind arriving at the same conclusion as he saw the new wave of panic on her face. "Grak. The Rodian. He's a greedy, paranoid bastard, but he's predictable. He'll be docked at the cargo depot, taking on new freight." It was a desperate, flimsy hope. But it was the only one they had. They changed direction, fighting their way back up through the station's strata, moving from the industrial squalor of The Sump towards the more open, dangerous platforms of the main transport hubs. As they climbed, the feeling of the Inquisitor grew stronger, a suffocating blanket of cold that made it hard to breathe. He was no longer a distant pinpoint; he was a palpable presence, a void that was beginning to suck the warmth and life out of the very air around them. They had to get to the ship before he realised they were no longer in The Sump, before he widened his search and cast his cold gaze upon the crowded docking platforms where they were now horribly exposed.The climb was a journey through the station’s stratified society. They left the thrumming, steam-choked guts of The Sump behind, ascending via a series of rickety, swaying lift-cages that were usually used for hauling scrap. Each level they rose brought cleaner air and a different kind of danger. The mid-levels were a chaotic sprawl of cantinas, gambling dens, and black-market stalls where disputes were settled with the flash of a blaster. Here, they were just another pair of desperate faces in the crowd, their anxiety a drop in an ocean of avarice and bad intentions. But as they neared the upper docking platforms, the crowds thinned and the spaces widened. The corridors became vast, hangar-like thoroughfares, open to the polluted, star-flecked void. There was nowhere to hide. Every shadow was shallow, every face clearly visible under the harsh industrial lights. Aela felt horribly exposed, like a field mouse scurrying across a brightly lit floor while a hawk circled overhead. The Inquisitor’s presence was a constant, suffocating pressure now, a weight on her mind that made her thoughts slow and sluggish. He was still sweeping the lower levels, but she knew it was only a matter of time before he realized his prey had flown.

They finally emerged onto Cargo Depot 94, a vast, semi-circular platform jutting out into the void. It was a chaotic symphony of motion and noise. Hulking transport droids rumbled past, carrying containers that smelled of exotic spices and industrial solvents. Dock workers in stained overalls shouted orders over the screech of landing struts and the hiss of hydraulic ramps. Dozens of ships were moored in their docking clamps, ranging from sleek corporate couriers to battered, ugly freighters like the one they sought. Finding the *Puffin’s Gamble* here would be impossible by sight alone. Ewan, reverting to his practical nature, began looking for a public terminal where he might be able to access the depot’s docking registry, a risky move that would leave a digital trail.

“No time,” Aela whispered, grabbing his arm. “He’s changing his pattern. He’s stopped searching grid by grid. He’s just… listening now.” She closed her eyes, trying to block out the cacophony of the depot. She pushed past the surface thoughts of the dock workers—their boredom, their irritation, their longing for the end of their shift—and searched for a specific flavor of grime and greed. She looked for the memory of cold, the psychic echo of frozen langoustine and their own desperate fear. It was a faint trace, almost completely obscured, but it was there. A thin, greasy thread in the overwhelming tapestry. “That way,” she said, her eyes snapping open. She pointed towards the far end of the curved platform, where the ugliest, most forgotten-looking ships were moored. They broke into a run, weaving through the lumbering droids and oblivious workers, their hearts pounding in a frantic, syncopated rhythm of hope and terror.

And there it was. Tucked away behind a much larger ship, its hull looking even rustier and more pathetic than they remembered, was the *Puffin’s Gamble*. A crew of sullen-looking Weequay were sullenly loading crates of what looked and smelled like dehydrated fungus onto its open ramp. And standing at the top of the ramp, his snout twitching with irritation as he bellowed at the loaders, was Grak the Rodian. He saw them approaching, and the irritation on his face curdled into pure, unadulterated fury. He knew instantly that their presence meant trouble, the kind that could not be solved with credits. He stormed down the ramp to meet them, his massive frame blocking their path. "No," he growled, the single word a wall of absolute refusal. "Get away from my ship. Now."

"Grak, please," Ewan panted, stepping in front of Aela. "We need passage. Anywhere. We'll pay, we have more credits—" "Lies!" the Rodian snarled, jabbing a thick, clawed finger at Ewan’s chest. "You have nothing. You are trouble. I can smell it. I am a legitimate businessman. I will not have my vessel associated with… whatever you are." He turned his burning gaze on Aela. "I should have spaced you when I had the chance." It was at that exact moment that Aela felt the Inquisitor's presence snap from a diffuse pressure into a razor-sharp point. He was here. In this depot. The ambient noise of the platform seemed to dip, and a sudden, unnatural chill swept across the deck. Workers shivered, glancing around, their breath misting in the air. The confident fury on Grak’s face faltered, replaced by a flicker of primal fear.

Aela met his terrified gaze, and in a moment of pure, desperate instinct, she didn't shield her own fear from him. She let him feel it. She let him feel the suffocating cold, the absolute certainty of a predator closing in, the chilling image of a dark figure that was the antithesis of life and profit. She showed him, without words, the thing that was coming for them, a power that would not negotiate, a power that would tear his ship apart to find them and not think twice about it. His beady black eyes widened in horror. His greed, the central pillar of his existence, was instantly and completely eclipsed by a far more potent emotion: terror.

He stared past her, his gaze fixed on the entrance to the depot. A figure had emerged from the shadows, tall and unnaturally still. Clad in black, form-fitting armor, the Inquisitor moved with a liquid grace that was utterly at odds with the clumsy, workaday bustle of the dock. His face was pale and narrow, dominated by the burning intensity of his gaze. He hadn't seen them yet, but his head was turning slowly, his senses sweeping the platform. Grak didn't hesitate. Survival was a cleaner transaction than loyalty. "On the ship! Now!" he roared, no longer at them, but to them. He grabbed Ewan by the collar and practically threw him towards the ramp, shoving Aela after him. "Seal the ramp! Prepare for immediate departure!" he bellowed into his comm, his voice cracking with panic. He scrambled up the ramp after them, not even looking back.

They stumbled into the familiar, grimy interior of the ship as the heavy ramp began to rise with a hydraulic hiss. Aela risked one last look back through the closing gap. The Inquisitor had spotted them. He was moving now, breaking into a fluid, impossibly fast run. He covered the hundred meters between them in a few silent, terrifying strides. He was not going to make it. And then, with a sound like a thunderclap, he leaped. Propelled by the Force, he soared through the air, a black arrow aimed at their heart. In his hand, a crimson blade ignited, casting a hellish red glare across the docking bay. The ramp was inches from sealing shut as he slammed against the outer hull, his gloved fingers scrabbling for a handhold on the closing seam.## Chapter 9

The universe compressed into the shriek of tortured metal and the hellish red glare that bled through the closing ramp. The Inquisitor’s impact was not a dull thud but a sharp, resonant crack that vibrated through the deck plates, a sound of absolute will striking against brute mechanics. A single, black-gloved hand was visible in the gap, fingers scrabbling for purchase, followed by the tip of the crimson blade as it slid through the narrowing aperture, painting the terrified faces of the Weequay loaders in the colour of blood. For a heartbeat, everyone was frozen, mesmerized by the sheer, violent audacity of the attack.

It was Grak who broke the spell. The Rodian let out a guttural roar of pure, animal terror and threw his considerable weight against the internal manual release for the ramp’s locking mechanism. “Seal it! Seal it now!” he bellowed, his voice a panicked squeal. Ewan, reacting on pure instinct, grabbed a heavy-looking spanner from a tool rack and wedged it into the ramp’s gearing, trying to add mechanical leverage to the hydraulics. But it was like trying to stop a charging krayt dragon with a walking stick. The Inquisitor’s strength, augmented by the dark side, was immense. The ramp’s upward movement stalled, groaning under the impossible strain. The gap, less than a foot wide, held firm.

Aela knew they had seconds. She pushed past the panicked Weequay, planting her feet on the grimy floor, her focus narrowing to a single point. She ignored the Inquisitor’s terrifying presence, ignored the searing red light, and focused on the ship itself. She reached out with the Force, not as a weapon, but as a mechanic. She felt the flow of hydraulic fluid in the ramp’s pistons, the strain in the gears, the immense pressure of the Inquisitor’s will fighting against the machine. She didn’t try to overpower him directly. Instead, she found the central hydraulic nexus and gave it a single, sharp, concentrated push, forcing a massive surge of pressure through the system. It was the mechanical equivalent of a knockout blow. With a deafening boom that echoed like a cannon shot, the hydraulics surged, shearing the spanner from Ewan’s hands and slamming the ramp shut. The final inch of the Inquisitor’s blade was sheared off, the red crystal within extinguishing as it clattered to the floor, a dead, smoking piece of black metal. A split second later, the ship’s magnetic clamps released with a violent jolt, and the *Puffin’s Gamble* lurched away from the docking platform, scraping against the gantry with a sound like tearing worlds.

They were not safe. A low, sizzling hum began to vibrate through the hull near the sealed ramp. It was a sound Aela knew from archival holos, the sound of a lightsaber blade heating metal to its melting point. A small, perfect circle of glowing orange appeared on the interior wall of the cargo hold. The Inquisitor was cutting his way in. “He’s on the hull!” Ewan yelled, his voice hoarse. The Weequay crew stared at the growing orange circle in silent, stupefied horror, their bravado completely evaporated. Grak, his face a sickly shade of grey-green, was already scrambling up the ladder towards the cockpit, screaming into his comm for an emergency jump to hyperspace, a process that was supposed to take minutes of careful calculation, not seconds of blind panic.

Aela ran to the wall, placing her hand near the glowing circle. The heat was immense. Through the metal, she could feel the cold, focused rage of the Inquisitor, a vortex of dark energy that promised nothing but death. They had maybe a minute before he was through. She closed her eyes, her mind racing, sifting through the ship’s systems, feeling the flow of energy, fuel, and coolant. The cargo hold was a dead end, but the ship itself was a network of possibilities. Her senses snagged on a conduit running along the outer hull, right past the spot where the Inquisitor was clinging. It felt intensely cold, a line of near-absolute zero. It was a primary coolant vent for the port engine’s cryo-cooler.

“Grak!” Aela screamed, her voice echoing in the cavernous hold. She didn’t know if he could hear her over his own panicked shouting. She projected her voice with the Force, a desperate, silent yell aimed directly at the cockpit. *Listen to me! There is a coolant vent on the port side, section seven! Vent it now!* For a moment, there was no response, only the rising pitch of the sizzling sound as the Inquisitor’s blade ate through the durasteel. Then, Grak’s voice crackled over the ship’s internal comm, laced with hysterical disbelief. “Are you insane? That’ll freeze the fuel line and cripple the engine! We’ll be adrift!” “We’ll be dead if you don’t!” Ewan bellowed back, his voice raw. He grabbed a fire extinguisher from the wall, a useless gesture of defiance against the glowing orange circle that was now beginning to bulge inward.

Aela focused again, sending a single, clear image to the Rodian’s mind: the Inquisitor’s blade bursting through the hull, the dark figure stepping into the ship, the cold, merciless end of everything. That was a language Grak understood. The ship gave a violent shudder as the pilot, presumably under new, frantic orders from Grak, slammed a control. From the outside, a massive cloud of pressurized cryo-coolant erupted from the hull, a silent, instantaneous blizzard of white vapour. The effect was immediate. Aela felt the Inquisitor’s presence, which had been a hot point of focused hatred, suddenly become a tumbling, chaotic smear of shock and fury. The super-cooled gas had flash-frozen his grip and sent him spiraling away from the ship, a black speck lost in the swirling, industrial smog of Scrapper’s Orbit. The sizzling sound stopped. The glowing circle on the wall faded back to a dull, scarred grey.

A moment later, the entire ship groaned, and the chaotic vista of the junk-city outside the cockpit viewports was pulled into the infinite blue and white streaks of hyperspace. The jump was violent and uncalculated, throwing them all from their feet. Aela landed hard, her head striking a cargo crate, the world momentarily dissolving into a field of stars that had nothing to do with the ones outside. Ewan was at her side instantly, helping her up, his face a mask of worry. “Are you alright?” he asked, his hands checking her for injuries. “I’m fine,” she managed, her head throbbing. The cargo hold was a scene of terrified relief. The Weequay were huddled together, muttering prayers to gods she didn’t know. Down the ladder from the cockpit stumbled Grak. He leaned against the bulkhead, his body trembling, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He looked at Aela, not with anger or suspicion, but with a new, terrifying emotion: reverence. He looked at her as if she were a god or a demon, a power utterly beyond his comprehension. "What… what are you?" he rasped.

Aela met his gaze, the exhaustion hitting her like a physical blow. The lie was over. The charade was pointless. "We're just passengers," she said, her voice weary. "Passengers you saved, Grak. And passengers that have made your ship a target for the rest of its very short life." The Rodian’s large, dark eyes widened as the truth of her words sank in. They hadn't just brought trouble to his ship; they had painted it with a target visible across the galaxy. They had escaped, but in doing so, had condemned their rescuers to the same fugitive existence.The Rodian’s face cycled through a spectrum of emotions. The raw terror of the attack gave way to a moment of awe, which was then immediately extinguished by the cold, dawning horror of Aela’s words. He looked at the scarred, blackened circle on his cargo bay wall, a permanent brand marking his ship as prey. He looked at his trembling Weequay crew, their simple lives of petty theft and manual labour now entangled in a conflict with forces they couldn’t possibly comprehend. His ship was not just a vessel; it was his life, his identity, his entire world. And it was now tainted, marked for destruction. The fear didn't leave him, but it transmuted from a panicked flight response into the cold, hard fury of a man who has lost everything.

“You,” he rasped, stabbing a shaking, clawed finger at Aela. “You have ruined me.” His voice was low, stripped of its usual bluster, leaving only a core of absolute despair. “My ship, my route, my contacts… all worthless. Scum like that don’t just give up. They will have the ship’s registry, its transponder code. Every port will be a trap. Every scan a death sentence.” He wasn’t shouting anymore. The situation was too dire for shouting. He was speaking as if delivering a eulogy for his own life. His large, dark eyes, usually so full of cunning and greed, were now hollowed out by a complete and utter loss of hope.

It was Ewan who stepped forward, placing himself partially in front of Aela, his expression grim but steady. “You saved our lives, Grak. That has to count for something.” The Rodian let out a harsh, barking laugh that was devoid of any humour. “It counts for this,” he said, gesturing around the grimy hold. “A crippled ship, flying blind through hyperspace, with an Imperial ghost on our tail. My life is forfeit because of you. So from now on, your lives belong to me.” The threat was clear, but the subtext was even clearer. He wasn't going to space them. They were, horrifyingly, his only asset. “You will tell me everything,” Grak snarled, his authority returning, warped into a new and dangerous shape. “Who you are. What you are. And why a demon with a fire sword wants you dead. My crew and I have a right to know what we are dying for.”

The cargo hold became a makeshift confessional. With Ewan providing a heavily redacted, secular version of events, Aela filled in the necessary gaps. She spoke of a rare ability, a connection that the remnants of the old Empire, a fanatical order of hunters, sought to exterminate. She didn’t use the word ‘Jedi’ or ‘Sith’, instead framing it as a war of ideologies, a hunt for those with a specific genetic marker that the old regime had deemed a threat. She was a refugee, a survivor of a forgotten persecution, and the Inquisitor was an exterminator, tying up loose ends from a war most of the galaxy had forgotten. It was a story crafted for a paranoid smuggler, a tale of political persecution and powerful enemies, something a creature of the Outer Rim’s criminal underworld could understand far better than spiritual philosophies.

Their desperate conference was cut short by a frantic squawk from the ship’s comm system. The Sullustan pilot’s voice, high and reedy with panic, echoed through the hold. “Captain! The navicomputer is fried! The power surge from the jump blew the primary buffer! I can’t hold our course! And the port engine is still offline, fuel line’s frozen solid! We’re going to drop out of hyperspace, but I have no idea where!” A cold silence fell over the hold. They were a dead stick, a piece of cosmic driftwood about to be spat out of the hyperspace currents into an unknown region of space, crippled and blind. Grak swore, a long, complex Rodian curse that painted a vivid picture of despair and financial ruin. The abstract threat of the Inquisitor was suddenly replaced by the immediate, practical threat of simply ceasing to exist in the cold, uncaring void.

The frantic energy of their escape was replaced by the focused desperation of a crew trying to save their ship. The artificial hierarchy of captain and passenger dissolved. Grak, his face a grim mask, began barking orders, directing his terrified crew to the engine room to try and manually thaw the fuel line. Ewan, surprisingly, found his footing in the chaos. He was strong, a quick learner, and possessed a dancer’s intuitive understanding of mechanics and leverage. He followed the Weequay into the engine room, hauling heavy tools, bracing overflowing pipes, and becoming, for the first time, not a burden, but a useful member of the crew. His presence, his willingness to get his hands dirty and share their fate, did more to earn the crew’s trust than any number of credits could have.

Aela, however, remained in the cargo hold. Her throbbing head made focus difficult, but she knew her strength was not in hauling tools. She sat on the cold deck, cross-legged amidst the crates of fungus, and reached out with the Force. She let her consciousness merge with the wounded vessel, feeling its pain as her own. She felt the blockage in the fuel line, a crystalline structure of frozen hydrocarbons. She felt the scorched, overloaded circuits of the navicomputer, a tangled knot of broken connections. She couldn’t heal the ship, but she could understand it. She began to act as its nervous system. A flash of insight sent to a Weequay mechanic, showing him which pressure valve to release. A subtle feeling of warmth directed at a specific joint in the fuel line, guiding the crew’s heat guns. A mental map of a scrambled circuit board passed to the Sullustan pilot, allowing him to bypass the fried buffer. She was the soul of the machine, a silent, invisible engineer working in a medium no one else could perceive.

Hours passed in a blur of focused effort and gnawing anxiety. Finally, a triumphant shout from the engine room signalled that the fuel line was clear. The port engine sputtered back to life with a shudder that ran through the entire ship. A few minutes later, the Sullustan pilot announced that he had managed to patch together a rudimentary navigation system, enough to control their exit from hyperspace. They were still lost, but they were no longer completely helpless. Ewan emerged from the engine room, covered in grease and grime, a wide, tired grin on his face. He came and sat beside Aela, his shoulder pressing against hers. The adrenaline had worn off, leaving a deep, weary ache. "We did it," he said softly, looking at his blistered hands with a kind of grim pride. "Who knew all those years of lifting you would be good practice for hauling engine parts?" Aela managed a weak smile, the connection to him a warm, steadying presence in the cold emptiness of space. They were alive. They had a functioning ship. But as the automated alarm began to blare, signalling their imminent return to realspace, they had no idea what kind of fire they were about to fall into.## Chapter 10

The transition back to realspace was not a gentle disengagement but a violent, wrenching expulsion. The ship dropped out of the blue-white tunnel of hyperspace with a groaning shudder that sent loose tools clattering across the deck. For a moment, the only sound was the panicked, wheezing breath of the Sullustan pilot over the comm and the groaning of stressed metal. They floated in an unnerving silence, adrift in a completely unknown sector of the galaxy. Ewan scrambled to the grimy cockpit viewport, Aela right behind him, peering out into the blackness. They had not emerged into the empty void or an asteroid field. Before them, hanging against a velvet curtain studded with unfamiliar constellations, was a breathtaking and terrifying sight: a colossal gas giant, a marbled sphere of churning turquoise and emerald, its vast surface wracked by silent, planet-sized lightning storms. And orbiting it, like a single green jewel, was a moon.

It was a world teeming with impossible life. Even from orbit, they could see that its surface was a near-unbroken blanket of lush, viridian jungle, shrouded in a thin, swirling mist. There were no visible signs of civilization, no city lights, no orbital stations, not even the faint geometric patterns of agriculture. It was a world that time, and the galaxy’s map-makers, had utterly forgotten. The Sullustan pilot’s voice crackled over the comm again, a string of technical data that translated into a simple, bleak assessment. The port engine was barely functioning, the navicomputer was a lost cause without a full diagnostic and parts they didn’t have, and their emergency power was draining at an alarming rate. They could not jump again. They could not call for help. Their only options were to land on the green moon or to wait in the cold darkness for their life support to fail.

Grak, his face a grimace of resignation, lumbered into the cockpit. He stared at the verdant moon with the deep-seated mistrust of a being who had spent his entire life in the artificial environments of starships and smog-choked stations. Nature, to him, was an unpredictable and unprofitable liability. He turned to Aela, his dark eyes narrowed. "You," he grunted. "Your… feeling. What does that place feel like? Is it another trap?" Aela closed her own eyes, ignoring the pilot's anxious muttering, and reached out. She had expected to feel nothing, or perhaps the simple, chaotic energy of a wild ecosystem. But what she felt startled her. The moon was singing in the Force. It was a single, powerful, unified chord of life, unimaginably ancient and overwhelmingly strong. It wasn't Light and it wasn't Dark; it was something else entirely, something primal and untamed, like the wilder Force of Aberdeen magnified a thousand times. It felt neutral, but profoundly alien. It was the deep, resonant hum of a world that was entirely, and powerfully, aware. "It's alive," she whispered, opening her eyes. "All of it. But it's not hostile. It’s just… watching."

The decision was made for them. They had no other choice. The descent through the moon’s atmosphere was a harrowing, controlled crash. The damaged ship bucked and shuddered, alarms blaring as the Sullustan pilot fought to keep them from tumbling end over end. They broke through the layer of mist into a world of impossible scale. The trees were gargantuan, their trunks as thick as starship command towers, their canopies forming a dense green ceiling hundreds of metres above the jungle floor. Waterfalls of unbelievable size cascaded from floating, vine-covered islands of rock that defied gravity. The air outside was thick with life, visible even as they fell, teeming with swarms of iridescent, winged creatures. The pilot, with a final, desperate burst of power from the failing engines, managed to guide the *Puffin’s Gamble* into a small, natural clearing, bringing it down with a bone-jarring impact that sent them all sprawling. And then, silence. A silence broken only by the frantic ticking of cooling metal and, from outside, the deafening, chittering, and melodic chorus of a truly alien world.

The ramp lowered with a groan, not onto a grimy docking bay, but onto a carpet of soft, phosphorescent moss that glowed with a gentle blue light. The air that washed into the ship was heavy, humid, and rich with the scent of unknown blossoms, damp earth, and ozone. It was the first truly fresh air Aela had breathed in weeks, and it felt both intoxicating and strangely threatening. Grak and his crew immediately began damage assessments, their technological pragmatism a stark contrast to the overwhelming, almost magical world outside. Ewan, however, simply stood on the ramp, his face a mask of wonder, turning in a slow circle. "Look at this place," he breathed. "It's like a fairy tale." He took a cautious step onto the glowing moss, which pulsed with a brighter light under his boot before dimming again. Aela followed, her senses alive. The hum of the Force was everywhere now, a low thrum that vibrated up from the very soil, a constant, living presence that was both calming and unnerving. She felt like she was standing in the heart of a vast, sleeping creature.

While the crew worked, Aela and Ewan ventured a short distance from the ship, tasked with finding a source of fresh water. The jungle was a cathedral of towering, alien flora. Great, bell-shaped flowers pulsed with internal light, and vines as thick as a man’s arm snaked between trees, dripping a sweet-smelling sap. Strange, multi-limbed creatures with wide, curious eyes watched them from the high branches before skittering away. They found a stream, its water running crystal clear over smooth, black stones that seemed to drink the light. As Ewan knelt to fill their canteens, Aela’s gaze was drawn to a shape half-hidden by a curtain of hanging moss. It was a stone archway, its surface covered in carvings. But it wasn’t the work of any known culture. The lines were flowing and organic, more grown than carved, and the symbols etched into the rock were completely alien, yet achingly familiar.

Drawn by a curiosity that overrode her caution, she pushed aside the moss and stepped through the arch. They were in a small, circular clearing, dominated by a single, monolithic standing stone. The air here was different, still and silent, the riotous noise of the jungle muted as if by a wall of glass. The central stone was covered in the same spiraling, unfamiliar script, and it radiated a quiet, immense power that made the hair on Aela’s arms stand up. It was a focus, a place of deep and ancient connection to the Force, but it felt nothing like a Jedi temple or a Sith shrine. This was older. Wilder. She reached out and pressed her palm against the stone’s cool, rough surface. The moment she made contact, a wave of energy, a billion years of silent memory, surged into her. She saw visions of a galaxy without starships, of beings made of pure light and sound, of life taking its first, hesitant steps on a thousand worlds. She felt a presence, a vast, ancient consciousness that was the moon itself, and it turned its slow, geologic attention upon her. It knew her. It recognized the spark of the Force within her as a distant, lost echo of its own song. And from the shadows of the ancient trees surrounding the clearing, Aela felt the distinct, unmistakable sensation of being watched, not by a single pair of eyes, but by many. The watchers were not hostile, but they were not friendly either. They were curious. And they were waiting.Ewan, hearing no reply from Aela, turned from the stream, a full canteen in his hand. He saw her standing transfixed in the archway, her hand pressed to the monolithic stone as if listening to its secrets. He called her name, but she didn’t respond. A sudden, unnatural silence had fallen over the clearing, the jungle’s cacophony muted, and a prickling sensation crawled up the back of his neck. It was the feeling of being watched. From the deep, dappled shadows between the colossal trees, figures began to emerge. They were tall and impossibly slender, their forms blending so perfectly with the forest that they seemed to be extensions of it. Their skin was the colour and texture of ancient, silvery bark, and their long, unbound hair was like trailing moss, woven with small, faintly glowing fungi. They carried no weapons, but they moved with a silent, fluid grace that was more intimidating than any drawn blaster. Their faces were long, serene, and ageless, and their eyes, large and dark, held a soft, internal bioluminescence, like the moss on the forest floor. Ewan’s hand went instinctively to the vibro-knife at his belt, but he didn’t draw it. He stayed perfectly still, his heart hammering against his ribs, his eyes locked on Aela, waiting for a signal, a cue, any sign of what he should do.

The torrent of visions receded, leaving Aela gasping, her mind reeling as if she had just relived a thousand lifetimes in a single second. She staggered back from the stone, her hand dropping to her side, a profound, soul-deep exhaustion settling over her. As her vision cleared, she saw them. The watchers. She saw them not only with her eyes, but with her newly awakened senses, feeling their presence in the Force as a grove of ancient, deeply rooted trees, their collective consciousness as calm and vast as an ocean. They were the moon’s children, or perhaps a part of the moon itself. One of them, its moss-like hair adorned with a single, luminous blue flower, took a slow, deliberate step forward. It did not speak, but a thought, clear as a bell, bloomed directly in Aela's mind. It was not a voice, but a pure concept, a question crafted from feeling and intent. *Why is your song so sharp? So discordant? You hurt the silence.*

Still trembling from the aftershocks of the vision, Aela met the watcher's luminous gaze. There was no artifice she could use here, no lie that would hold in the face of such profound awareness. They would feel the truth of her, whether she spoke it or not. So she answered them in their own language. She opened the quiet, guarded chambers of her heart and let her story flow out into the Force, a raw, unfiltered broadcast of emotion and memory. She showed them the soaring joy of the Spire Leap, a note of pure, unbridled life. Then she showed them the cold, sterile void of the Seeker, the hungry, hateful fire of the Inquisitor’s blade, and the frantic, desperate terror of their flight through the stars. She didn’t try to explain the politics of the Empire or the philosophy of the Jedi; she simply showed them the hunt, the ancient, brutal dynamic of the predator and the prey, the dissonant chord of the dark side that sought to extinguish her light. Ewan could only watch, bewildered, as Aela stood perfectly still, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek, locked in a silent, intense communion with the serene, alien creature before her.

The watcher received her story not with shock or pity, but with a deep, weary sense of recognition. Its own thoughts flowed back into her mind, vast and slow like the grinding of continents. It showed her images of their own history, a history that spanned eons. They had a name for her light; it translated loosely as the Growing Song. And they had a name for the darkness that hunted her: the Silent Rot. They showed her visions of stars dying, of civilizations turning to dust, of other bearers of the Song being consumed by the Rot countless times across the millennia. The conflict was not new to them; it was a cyclical, destructive fever that periodically gripped the galaxy. Her Spire Leap, her loud, beautiful, defiant note, had been the first clear sound of the Growing Song they had heard in centuries, and it had echoed across the void, a dinner bell for the ever-patient Rot. They had been waiting for the discord to arrive at their shores. They had been waiting for her.

A new thought, a different kind of communication, then came from the lead watcher. It was not a memory or a question, but an offer, cool and clear as the water in the stream. *Your song is loud, and it draws the Rot. But it can be quieted. We can teach you. We can teach you to weave your melody into the great chorus of the moon, to hide your light among a trillion other lights until you are just one more voice in the harmony. You will be invisible. You will be safe.* The offer settled in Aela’s mind, a seductive promise of peace. Sanctuary. An end to the running. She could feel the truth of it; the moon’s immense life force could swallow her presence in the Force completely, rendering her undetectable to any Inquisitor. But as the watcher’s thought unfolded, she felt the price. To blend her song, she would have to stay here, forever. To become a part of the moon was to abandon the galaxy. She would be safe, but she would be a prisoner of paradise, her fight over. She looked over at Ewan, who was still standing by the stream, his hand on his knife, his face a mask of fierce, confused loyalty, a man of cities and crowds and loud music, ready to follow her into any hell. The watcher’s offer would be his cage as much as her sanctuary. The choice was hers: to continue the desperate, discordant song of survival out in the galaxy, or to find a final, quiet harmony here, at the cost of everything she had ever known.
