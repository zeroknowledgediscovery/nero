The Reverend Hamish Macleod, Vicar of Glenfinnan-by-the-Loch, was a man whose faith was as solid and dependable as the granite hills that cradled his parish. It was a faith built on kindness, community, and the unwavering belief that God, in His infinite wisdom, had a particular fondness for a well-made meat pie. This theological standpoint was not one he often shared from the pulpit, but it was a truth he held self-evident in the quiet of his own heart, particularly on a Tuesday morning when the post arrived.

He sat in his study, a room that smelled perpetually of old books and lemon polish, a half-finished cup of tea cooling at his elbow. Outside, a soft, persistent drizzle, the kind the locals called ‘smirr’, was busy blurring the edges of the world, turning the usually majestic Ben Christie into a watercolour smudge against a grey sky. Hamish paid it no mind. His attention was fixed on the envelope in his hands. It was thick, cream-coloured, and bore the crest of the ‘Golden Crust Grand Pie-Eating Championship of All Scotland’. His heart, a usually steady and rhythmic organ, was performing a frantic little jig against his ribs.

With a tremor he hadn't felt since his first sermon, he slid a finger under the seal. The paper inside was just as grand, the text embossed in a font that screamed importance. He read it once, then twice, his breath held tight in his chest. His lips moved, silently mouthing the key phrase: ‘…delighted to inform you of your successful qualification for the Grand Final…’ A slow smile spread across his face, a sunrise of pure, unadulterated joy. He had done it. His performance at the regional qualifier in Oban, where he had dispatched twelve mutton pies in ten minutes – a personal best and a new regional record – had been enough. He was going to the final.

His joy was a bright, buttery thing, flaking at the edges like a perfect puff pastry. He could almost taste the victory. The grand prize was a golden pie dish, a lifetime supply of flour from a very fancy mill in the Borders, and, most importantly, bragging rights for a full year. For Hamish, it was more than that. It was a validation of a secret passion, a part of him that didn't fit neatly into a dog collar. In his ministry, he nourished souls. In the contest, he nourished himself, and the competitive spirit that lay dormant under layers of clerical tweed.

“Wipe that look off your face, Hamish, or a bird’ll mistake your mouth for a nest and move in.”

The voice, dry as a water biscuit, belonged to his cousin, Morag. She stood in the doorway, a wicker basket of what he knew would be laundry on her hip, her expression a familiar blend of exasperation and deep-seated affection. Morag had been managing his manse, and by extension his life, for the past decade, ever since her own husband had gone to his final reward. She was a woman as practical and unsentimental as the slate on the church roof.

“Good news, Morag! Absolutely spectacular news!” he boomed, waving the letter like a triumphant flag.

She ambled in, setting the basket down with a weary thud. “Let me guess. The Bishop’s finally agreed to let you wear tartan vestments for the Harvest Festival?”

“Better!”

“They’ve found a way to make communion wafers taste of shortbread?”

“Morag, please,” he said, his smile unquenchable. “I’m in. The Golden Crust. The final! In Edinburgh!”

Morag picked up the letter, her eyes scanning the grandiloquent prose. She sniffed. “Well, I hope the Almighty has a sense of humour. The Reverend Hamish Macleod, finalist in a contest of competitive gluttony. What will the parish council say?”

“They’ll say ‘Well done, Vicar! Bring home the gold!’,” Hamish insisted, puffing out his chest. “Mrs. Gable from the post office has a ten-pound note riding on me. And young Ewan from the farm said my performance in Oban was ‘divine intervention’.”

“Divine intervention is fixing the leak in the vestry roof, Hamish. Consuming a flock’s worth of mutton pies in under ten minutes is… something else entirely.” She folded the letter and handed it back to him, a flicker of a smile playing on her lips. “Still. Edinburgh, you say? It’ll be a nice day out, I suppose. Just try not to make a spectacle of yourself.”

“A spectacle? Morag, this is sport! It’s the precision of the fork, the strategy of the swallow, the management of the… the internal capacity.” He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “I’ve been training. In secret.”

Morag raised a skeptical eyebrow. “Training? Don’t tell me you’ve been eating the hymn books.”

“Don’t be daft. I’ve been expanding my stomach’s natural elasticity with copious amounts of water. And… and I’ve been practicing my breathing. It’s all about rhythm. Inhale on the lift, exhale on the down-swallow. It minimises air intake.”

She stared at him for a long moment, then shook her head, a soft chuckle escaping her. “Ach, Hamish. You’re a good man, but you’re a daft one. There are bigger things in life to be worrying about.”

“Not for the next two weeks there aren’t,” he said with a grin. “For the next two weeks, my focus is singular. My purpose is pure. My destiny is pastry.”

His enthusiasm was infectious, a warm glow that filled the chilly study. He spent the rest of the day in a blissful haze. Even his pastoral duties took on a pie-themed hue. While visiting the elderly Mrs. Mackenzie, he found himself admiring the crimping on her lace doilies, his mind comparing them to the superior fluted edge of a well-baked pork pie. During a planning meeting for the summer fête, his suggestion of a ‘guess the weight of the vicar’ stall was met with a confused silence. His sermon for the upcoming Sunday began to form in his head, a complex and slightly tortured metaphor comparing the layers of a good puff pastry to the layers of faith, each one needing to be light and airy, yet strong enough to hold the filling. It was, he had to admit, a bit of a stretch, but his heart was in it.

The contest was more than just a silly competition to him. It was a link to his father. Alistair Macleod had been a baker, a stern, flour-dusted man who saw the world in shades of black and white. He had viewed Hamish’s decision to join the church as a flight of fancy, a soft option for a boy who lacked the grit to knead dough before dawn. “A man’s work is with his hands, with fire and flour,” he used to say, his own hands calloused and strong. Alistair had been a master of his craft, his steak and kidney pies legendary throughout Argyll. He had competed once, in a local fair, and lost. He never spoke of it again, but the small, tarnished silver medal for second place sat on the mantelpiece for years, a quiet monument to his failure. Winning the Golden Crust… it felt like finishing a chapter his father had been forced to close. It felt like proving that a man of God could still have the grit of a baker’s son.

That evening, after a dinner of steamed fish and boiled potatoes that Morag had pointedly served him (“Best not to strain your professional equipment before the big day”), Hamish logged onto his computer, his fingers tapping with excitement. The official Golden Crust website had a page dedicated to the finalists. There would be six of them in total. He clicked the link, his face illuminated by the screen’s glow. A gallery of faces appeared, each with a short, boisterous biography.

There was ‘Big’ Dave Donaldson from Dundee, a docker with a stomach that preceded him into a room by a good two feet. There was Fiona ‘The Furnace’ Fraser from Inverness, a wiry PE teacher who apparently carb-loaded for marathons by eating entire family-sized pies. Hamish scanned their faces with the keen eye of a general studying his opposition. He felt a surge of confidence. He could take them. His technique was more refined, his focus more spiritual.

And then he saw him. The final face. The blood in Hamish’s veins turned to ice water. The buttery joy in his soul curdled. The photograph was of a large man with a brutal, square jaw and a shaved head that gleamed under the photographer’s flash. His eyes, small and set close together, held a look of profound menace, as if he personally blamed the camera for his existence. Below the picture, the name was printed in stark, bold letters: Angus ‘The Mauler’ MacLeod.

Hamish felt the air leave his lungs in a rush, as if he’d been punched. Angus MacLeod. His nemesis. His tormentor from childhood. A distant cousin from the ‘other’ MacLeods, the ones his family hadn’t spoken to since a dispute over a prize-winning sheep in 1922. Angus had made Hamish’s school days a living hell, his bulk and cruelty a constant shadow. He was the one who had mockingly called Hamish ‘Holy Hamish’ long before he’d ever found a calling. He was the one who had, on one particularly miserable sports day, stolen Hamish’s lunch – a perfect, lovingly prepared slice of his father’s steak pie – and eaten it in front of him, crumb by agonizing crumb.

And his biography… Hamish read it with a growing sense of horror. ‘Angus MacLeod, owner of ‘MacLeod’s Meats’ in Falkirk, believes that winning is everything. A three-time winner of the Central Belt Strongman competition, Angus has turned his legendary appetite to the world of competitive eating. “Pies are just meat in a convenient pastry handle,” he is quoted as saying. “Second place is just the first loser. I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to destroy.”’

Destroy. The word echoed in the quiet of the study. This wasn’t a sporting contest anymore. This was a reckoning. The golden pie dish, the bragging rights, the quiet nod to his father’s memory – it was all secondary now. This was about vanquishing the demon of his past. This was about the stolen slice of pie from all those years ago. The smirr outside seemed to intensify, tapping against the windowpane like a nervous finger. The path to pastry glory was no longer a gentle, rolling hill. It was a sheer cliff face, and at the top, a brute in a butcher’s apron was waiting for him. The joy had gone, replaced by a cold, hard knot of dread and, to his great shame, a furious, un-Christian desire for revenge.The Reverend Hamish Macleod shut the laptop with a snap, the click echoing the sudden closing off of his good humour. He pushed his chair back from the desk, the legs scraping harshly on the wooden floor. He began to pace the small study, a caged tiger in clerical grey, the scent of lemon polish and old paper suddenly feeling cloying and restrictive. The room, his sanctuary, now felt like a prison. Angus ‘The Mauler’ MacLeod. The name was a foul taste in his mouth, metallic and bitter like spoiled meat. All the simple, wholesome joy he had felt was gone, replaced by a churning vortex of old resentments. He wasn't just facing a competitor; he was facing a caricature of every brutish, cynical value he had spent his life trying to counter. Angus didn't respect the pie. He saw it as a ‘convenient pastry handle’. The blasphemy of it!

For Hamish, a pie was a sacred object. It was a vessel of comfort, a testament to patience and skill. The perfect alchemy of fat, flour, and water creating a crisp, golden shell; the slow-braised filling, rich and deep with flavour. His father had taught him that a pie wasn't just food; it was a story. It told of the animal, the land it came from, the skill of the butcher, and the love of the baker. To Angus, it was just fuel. It was an obstacle to be demolished. The contest was no longer about a golden dish; it was a crusade to defend the very soul of pie itself against the soulless, brute force of men like Angus MacLeod. This was theology now. Good versus Evil, with a flaky crust.

“The ghost of Christmas Yet to Come paid you a visit, has he?” Morag’s voice cut through his dark thoughts. She was back in the doorway, holding his now-cold cup of tea. She hadn’t left, merely retreated to the kitchen to let him have his moment. Her sharp eyes missed nothing. “You look like you’ve just seen the devil himself.”

“Worse, Morag. Much worse,” Hamish said, his voice a low growl. He gestured grimly towards the closed laptop. “I’ve seen Angus MacLeod.”

Morag’s face, usually a mask of weary competence, tightened. The name landed in the room with the weight of a dropped anvil. “Not Angus from Falkirk? The butcher? That great lump?” She knew of whom he spoke. The schism between the two MacLeod branches was a piece of family lore, a cautionary tale told to children about stubbornness and sheep. “What’s he got to do with anything?”

“He’s a finalist,” Hamish said, the words tasting like ash. “He’s one of the six. He calls himself ‘The Mauler’.”

Morag let out a short, sharp laugh devoid of any humour. “Well, he always was a mauler. I remember him at your grandfather’s funeral, eating all the sausage rolls before the coffin was even in the ground. I’m surprised he hasn’t eaten himself into an early grave.” She placed the cold tea on the mantelpiece, her expression hardening into one of grim solidarity. “So that’s it, then? The bully from the playground is back.”

“It’s the pie, Morag,” Hamish whispered, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. “He stole my father’s pie. On sports day. I can still see his greasy face, laughing at me.” It sounded so childish, so petty, yet the memory was branded on his soul. It was the moment he had first understood true injustice. The helplessness, the humiliation, the sheer unfairness of it. It was a tiny wound that had never quite healed, and now Angus was there, ready to pour salt in it.

“And you’re going to let a forty-year-old grudge about a stolen snack put you off?” Morag challenged, her voice firm. “I thought you were a man of the cloth. Turn the other cheek and all that.”

“The Lord provides us with strength to face our demons, Morag. He doesn’t say we have to let them win,” Hamish retorted, a fire lighting in his eyes. The dread was still there, a cold stone in his gut, but now it was surrounded by the hot flames of righteous anger. “This is not about revenge. It is about… a reckoning. It’s about justice. It’s about that golden pie dish sitting on my mantelpiece and not his.”

“So it is about revenge, then,” she said flatly, but there was a glint of approval in her eye. Morag understood battles, if not the finer points of theology. “Right. Well, you’d better stop pacing a trench in my clean floor and start training properly. No more of this water-drinking nonsense. If you’re going up against that brute, you’ll need more than a stretched stomach and a prayer. You’ll need a better strategy.”

And so, Operation Vanquish the Mauler began. The next two weeks saw a transformation in the Glenfinnan manse. The gentle, scholarly vicar was replaced by a driven athlete. His morning prayers were now followed by a rigorous regimen of stomach-stretching exercises that went far beyond mere water. He would drink a pint, wait ten minutes, then another, meticulously charting his capacity in a small, leather-bound notebook usually reserved for sermon ideas. The notes became a bizarre litany of times, volumes, and sensations: ‘2.5 litres – moderate discomfort’, ‘3 litres – significant bloating, mild light-headedness’, ‘3.5 litres – saw a vision of a talking haggis, must be a new plateau’.

Morag, having accepted the madness of the situation, became his unwilling but fiercely loyal corner-woman. She supervised his training with the grim efficiency of a boxing coach. “Less of the heavenly groaning, Hamish. This is what you wanted. Now, breathe. Deep from the diaphragm, like you’re about to hit the low note in ‘Abide With Me’.” She started adapting his meals, moving away from steamed fish and towards foods that were dense and easily consumed. She made vast pots of porridge, bowls of mashed potato, and great blancmanges that could be swallowed with minimal chewing. “Practice, Hamish. It’s all about efficiency of movement. No wasted energy.”

He even found himself analysing his sermons for performance tips. The cadence of a psalm, the rhythmic call-and-response of a prayer – it all fed into the new rhythm he was trying to master. Inhale on the lift, exhale on the down-swallow. He practiced in the vestry with communion wafers, palming a dozen at a time and trying to swallow them without water, a feat which nearly led to an embarrassing incident involving the church warden and the Heimlich manoeuvre. The children’s Sunday School, watching him demonstrate the story of Jonah and the Whale with a particularly wide-mouthed gesture, thought their vicar had never been more animated. He was a man possessed, his parish a mere backdrop to the epic contest that consumed his waking thoughts and pastry-filled dreams. The final in Edinburgh was no longer a jolly day out; it was his Agincourt, his Waterloo, his Bannockburn, all rolled into one glorious, terrifying, meat-filled showdown.The journey to Edinburgh was a pilgrimage in reverse. Instead of heading towards a place of quiet contemplation, Hamish was driving towards a crucible of noise, competition, and industrial-scale digestion. Or rather, Morag was driving. Hamish sat in the passenger seat of her trusty, if slightly battered, Morris Minor, his eyes closed, his hands resting on his tweed-clad knees. He was in the zone. The rolling hills of the central lowlands passed by unnoticed; the distant, gleaming steel of the Forth bridges was ignored. He was focused inward, visualising the task ahead, practicing the slow, deep breathing that had become second nature to him over the past fortnight. The car smelled of Morag’s lavender air freshener and the faint, ghostly aroma of the single, foil-wrapped practice pie that lay in a cool bag on the back seat, a final sacrifice to the gods of competitive eating.

“If you’re going to be sick, Hamish, do try and give me some warning,” Morag said, not taking her eyes off the road. “I’ve just had this upholstery cleaned.”

“I’m not going to be sick, Morag,” he murmured, his eyes still shut. “I am achieving a state of meditative calm. I am becoming one with the pie.”

“You’re becoming a menace, is what you’re becoming,” she sniffed, but she downshifted with a practiced smoothness as they entered the outskirts of the city. The calm of the countryside evaporated, replaced by the roar of traffic and the imposing, soot-darkened grandeur of Edinburgh’s architecture. Hamish opened his eyes. The castle, perched on its volcanic rock, looked down on them with stony indifference. He felt a sudden pang of anxiety, the small-town vicar swallowed by the scale of the capital. This was a world away from the familiar comfort of Glenfinnan, where the biggest commotion was a sheep blocking the road.

They found the venue, a vast and venerable assembly hall, without much trouble. A magnificent banner, emblazoned with the 'Golden Crust' crest, was stretched between two mighty Corinthian columns, a declaration of intent that seemed both ludicrous and thrilling. Inside, the air was thick with anticipation and the glorious, heart-stopping smell of thousands of pies baking. It was the scent of heaven itself. Officials with clipboards bustled about, while in a cordoned-off waiting area, the other finalists were preparing themselves. Hamish saw them, a gallery of legends in the flesh. ‘Big’ Dave Donaldson was performing a series of gentle, undulating stretches, his enormous stomach moving like a slow tide. Fiona ‘The Furnace’ Fraser was methodically taping her fingers, her expression one of ferocious concentration. They all looked so professional, so prepared. Hamish, clutching his competitor’s bib with the number four on it, suddenly felt like an amateur, a parish priest who had wandered into the gladiators’ den by mistake.

And then he saw him. Lounging in a chair that seemed impossibly small beneath him, holding court with a couple of burly men who looked like they might be his personal bodyguards, was Angus ‘The Mauler’ MacLeod. He was even bigger and more menacing in person. A thick, bull-like neck strained against the collar of a tight black t-shirt that had ‘MAULER’ printed across the chest in stark, aggressive letters. He wasn't warming up or meditating; he was laughing, a loud, brutish sound that scraped at Hamish’s nerves. As if sensing his gaze, Angus turned his head. His small eyes narrowed, scanning the room before they locked onto Hamish. The laughter died in his throat. A slow, malicious grin spread across his face.

With a deliberate, swaggering gait, Angus pushed himself out of his chair and ambled over. He stopped a foot in front of Hamish, close enough that the vicar could smell the faint, unpleasant odour of raw meat and cheap aftershave. He looked Hamish up and down, his eyes lingering on the dog collar with undisguised contempt.
“Well, well, well,” Angus boomed, his voice a low rumble. “If it isn’t Holy Hamish. I heard you’d qualified. I thought it was a joke. Come to bless the pies before I send them to their maker?” His cronies snickered behind him.

Hamish felt a familiar cold dread wash over him, the same helpless fear he had felt as a boy in the schoolyard. He could feel his carefully constructed calm beginning to fracture. He wanted to shrink away, to mumble an excuse and retreat to Morag’s side. But then he saw the look in Angus’s eyes – the same smug, cruel certainty that he’d seen all those years ago, just before he’d stolen his lunch. The memory, sharp and painful, lanced through him. He thought of his father’s disappointed face, of Morag’s stern encouragement, of the parishioners of Glenfinnan who believed in him. The fear receded, replaced by a cold, hard resolve. He straightened his back.

“Hello, Angus,” Hamish said, his voice surprisingly steady. “It’s been a long time.”

“Not long enough,” Angus sneered. “You’re a long way from your church, little vicar. This is a man’s game. You don’t have the stomach for it.” He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial, venomous whisper. “Still remember sports day? Best slice of pie I ever tasted. Though I imagine it tasted even better knowing it was yours.”

That was it. The final, brutal jab. Hamish looked at the coarse, sneering face of his tormentor, and something inside him clicked into place. All the anxiety, all the doubt, solidified into a single, pure point of focus. This was no longer just a competition. This was his ministry. He met Angus’s gaze without flinching, a faint, serene smile touching his lips. “The Lord works in mysterious ways, Angus,” he said, his tone gentle but laced with steel. “Sometimes He tests our faith. And sometimes,” he paused, letting the words hang in the air, “He uses a simple meat pie to teach a bully a long-overdue lesson in humility.”

Angus stared at him, momentarily thrown. It wasn’t the cowed, frightened response he had expected. He searched Hamish’s face for a flicker of fear and found only a placid, unshakeable certainty. With a grunt of frustration, he jabbed a thick finger into Hamish’s chest. “We’ll see about that, Holy Man. I’m going to enjoy this. I’m going to break you.” He turned on his heel and stalked back to his chair, the aura of menace around him now tinged with a faint note of angry confusion.

Hamish let out a breath he hadn’t realised he was holding, his legs feeling slightly shaky. He had done it. He hadn’t run. Morag appeared at his side, her face an unreadable mask, though he thought he saw a flicker of pride in her eyes. "Well," she said, straightening his slightly askew collar. "You didn't burst into tears, so we can count that as a victory. Now stop trembling like a leaf. Remember your breathing. And for the love of all that’s holy, don't forget to chew just enough. I'll not be explaining to the Bishop how his vicar choked to death on national television over a mutton pie." Her brutally practical words were more comforting than any prayer. The fear was gone. The dread had been cauterised. All that remained was purpose.

A klaxon sounded, sharp and commanding. A booming voice echoed through the hall. “Finalists, please take your places on the stage! The Golden Crust Grand Pie-Eating Championship is about to begin!” A wave of applause and cheers swept through the crowd. Hamish gave Morag one last, grateful nod and walked towards the brightly-lit stage. It felt like walking towards a pulpit and an executioner’s block all at once. He took his position at station number four, a towering stack of twelve perfect, golden-crusted steak pies waiting for him. Down the table, at station six, Angus MacLeod was cracking his knuckles, a predatory glare fixed on Hamish. The lights were blinding. The roar of the crowd was a physical force. The final countdown began. Ten… nine… eight… Hamish closed his eyes, took one last, deep, cleansing breath, and whispered a short, silent prayer. It wasn’t for victory. It was for strength.The final klaxon was a physical assault, a shriek of compressed air that ripped through the hall and launched the competitors into a frenzy of motion. Beside him, Hamish heard a sound like a sack of potatoes being torn open; it was Angus MacLeod attacking his first pie. He didn’t use cutlery. He simply grabbed it, crushed the pastry shell in one meaty fist, and began cramming the splintered remains into his mouth, gravy and meat spilling down his chin and onto his ‘MAULER’ shirt. It was an act of pure, contemptuous demolition. In stark contrast, Hamish took one final, steadying breath. He picked up his fork and knife, the cool metal a familiar weight in his hands. With the precision of a surgeon, he made the first incision, splitting the golden puff pastry lid. Inhale on the lift. He raised the first piece to his lips. Exhale on the down-swallow. The contest had begun.

For the first two minutes, it was a study in contrasts. Angus blazed a trail of destruction, finishing his first two pies before Hamish was halfway through his second. The commentator, a man with a voice like a foghorn and a suit made of tartan, bellowed Angus’s early lead to the roaring crowd. “And The Mauler is living up to his name, folks! A truly ferocious start! He’s a machine, a pie-pulverising predator! The Reverend from Glenfinnan is taking a more… considered approach.” Hamish heard the words but did not let them penetrate the shield of his concentration. He was a rock in a storm of pastry shrapnel. His movements were economical, repetitive, hypnotic. Cut, lift, swallow, breathe. Cut, lift, swallow, breathe. It was a new kind of prayer, a gastronomic rosary. He blocked out the roaring crowd, the blinding lights, the sneering face of his rival. There was only the pie, his rhythm, and the quiet, fierce ghost of his father at his shoulder.

In the second row of the audience, Morag stood with her arms tightly crossed. She did not cheer or clap. She observed. She watched Angus MacLeod’s savage performance, her thin lips pressed into a line of disapproval. He was a fool. He was chewing too much, wasting energy. He was breathing through his mouth, taking in air, bloating his stomach. He was a sprinter trying to run a marathon, all brute force and no sense. Then her gaze shifted to Hamish. She saw the unwavering rhythm, the controlled breathing, the almost trance-like focus. She saw the years of quiet determination, the hidden grit she had always known was there, now laid bare for all to see. He wasn’t a daft man playing a silly game. He was a competitor. And against all her better judgement, against every cynical instinct she possessed, she felt a dangerous, unfamiliar surge of pride.

The five-minute mark came and went, and a subtle shift began to ripple through the contest. The Mauler was starting to flag. His face was a blotchy, alarming shade of crimson, and a sheen of sweat coated his gleaming head. He reached for his water bottle and took a huge, desperate gulp, a cardinal sin in the world of professional eating. The water would take up precious space, sloshing against the dense mass of pie and slowing him down. The commentator’s tone began to change. “A slight pause from The Mauler, folks, he’s reaching for the water! Meanwhile, the Vicar of Glenfinnan is maintaining his incredible pace! He’s a steam train, steady and relentless! He’s closing the gap!” Hamish felt the change in the air. He was on his seventh pie, and so was Angus. They were level. He allowed himself a brief, sideways glance. Angus met his gaze, his small eyes filled not with contempt now, but with a dawning, panicked fury.

It was on the ninth pie that the wall descended. The rich, savoury flavour of the steak filling, once a source of deep pleasure, turned to a bland, greasy mulch in his mouth. Each swallow was an act of rebellion against a body screaming that it was full. His stomach felt like a cannonball. This was the true test, the moment where technique and training met the unyielding limits of the flesh. It was no longer a sport; it was an ordeal. He wanted to stop. He wanted to push the plate away and sip a cool glass of water. He closed his eyes for a fraction of a second, and in the darkness, he saw his father’s flour-dusted hands, expertly crimping a pie crust. He saw the small, tarnished silver medal for second place. And then he saw Angus, that sneering boy on the sports field, triumphantly eating what was not his. A hot, righteous fire burned through the nausea. This was for the stolen pie. This was for the silent shame. This was for his father.

With two minutes left on the clock, they were pie for pie, bite for bite. They had both dispatched ten pies. The refined rhythm, the careful work with the fork, it was too slow now. This was the endgame. Hamish put down his cutlery with a decisive clatter. He looked at his hands, the hands that held Bibles and baptised infants, and saw in them the hands of a baker’s son. With a surge of raw, desperate energy, he grabbed his eleventh pie. The pastry, soaked with gravy, yielded in his grip. He broke it in half and, abandoning all decorum, all pretence of clerical dignity, he began to eat. The crowd, sensing the dramatic shift, let out a collective gasp that turned into a deafening roar. This was no longer Vicar versus Mauler. This was a primal battle of will.

The commentator was screaming himself hoarse. “They’re on their final pie! Both of them! This is unbelievable! Thirty seconds remaining!” Angus, his face a mask of disbelief and exhaustion, was fumbling, his movements uncoordinated. He was trying to match Hamish’s new, aggressive pace but was choking, coughing, his system in full revolt. Hamish barely saw him. His world had shrunk to the last few mouthfuls of steak and pastry on the plate before him. The clock’s final countdown boomed through the hall. "Ten! Nine! Eight!" He was chewing, swallowing, his jaw aching, his throat raw. He could hear Morag’s voice in his head: ‘Don’t you dare make a spectacle of yourself.’ "Five! Four! Three!" He grabbed the final, gravy-soaked piece of crust, a single, perfect bite. He shoved it into his mouth, his cheeks bulging. "Two! One!" He swallowed, a great, final, convulsive effort that brought tears to his eyes. The final, deafening klaxon sounded, and for a moment, the world went utterly silent and blessedly still. He slumped forward, his forehead coming to rest on the gravy-smeared table, every ounce of strength gone from his body.For a long moment, the only thing that existed was the sticky, gravy-slicked surface of the table against his forehead. The roaring of the crowd, the frantic commentary, the blinding lights – all of it had vanished, sucked into a vacuum of profound, bodily exhaustion. The silence was broken by the frantic thumping of his own heart, a drumbeat of survival. He felt impossibly full, a ship packed to the gunwales with a cargo of steak and pastry, riding low and heavy in the water. He was vaguely aware of a profound stickiness on his chin and a taste in his mouth that he suspected would haunt him for days, a ghost of rich, over-indulged beef. Slowly, painfully, he lifted his head. The world swam back into focus, a dizzying panorama of noise and light.

Officials in smart blazers were swarming the stage, their clipboards held like sacred tablets. The crowd was a single, roaring beast, on its feet, craning to see the outcome. He saw the chief official, a man with a magnificent handlebar moustache, march to Angus MacLeod’s station. The commentator, his voice now a shredded, gravelly wreck, was attempting to fill the void. “A truly astonishing finish, folks! We have a photo finish for the pies! The judges are conferring! Has the Vicar done it? Has The Mauler held on? The tension is thicker than a well-made gravy!” Hamish risked a look down the long table, his gaze drawn to his rival. Angus was not slumped over the table in exhausted defeat. He was leaning back in his chair, his face the colour of uncooked dough, his chest rising and falling in ragged, shallow gasps. And on his plate, a pathetic, mangled half-crust and a smear of jellied gravy remained. It was a ruin. It was failure.

Their eyes met across the debris of the battlefield. The sneering contempt was gone from Angus’s face. The brutish confidence had evaporated. In its place was a raw, hollowed-out humiliation, so naked and profound it was almost shocking to witness. For the first time in his life, looking at the man who had been the monster of his childhood, Hamish felt no fear, no anger, not even the sweet satisfaction of impending victory. He felt a sudden, unwelcome, and deeply confusing pang of pity. The Mauler had been vanquished, but the man who remained looked small, pathetic, and utterly broken. The grand demon of his past had been revealed as just another man, undone by his own hubris and a dozen steak pies.

The official with the moustache completed his inspection of Angus’s plate, made a note on his clipboard with a decisive flick of his pen, then turned and strode towards Hamish’s station. He peered at the empty plate, shining under the lights like a newly polished shield. He nodded once, crisply, and then gave the signal to the commentator. A hush fell. The commentator took a deep breath. “Ladies and gentlemen, after a thorough judicial review… it is confirmed! Angus ‘The Mauler’ MacLeod did not complete his final pie! His official total stands at eleven and one-half pies!” A wave of groans and cheers rippled through the hall. “Which means,” the commentator boomed, his voice rising to a triumphant crescendo, “with a full and complete twelve pies consumed… your new champion… the winner of the Golden Crust Grand Pie-Eating Championship of All Scotland… is The Reverend Hamish Macleod of Glenfinnan-by-the-Loch!”

The sound that erupted from the crowd was a physical force, a tidal wave of applause and cheers that washed over him. Hamish did not leap to his feet. He did not punch the air. He simply remained seated, the wave of noise breaking against him, and let the words sink in. He had done it. A slow, weary, beatific smile spread across his face. He closed his eyes, the lights turning the inside of his eyelids a warm, celebratory red. He had faced the demon, he had honoured his father, he had eaten the pies. And the victory, now that it was here, felt less like a fiery explosion of joy and more like a quiet, profound, and deeply satisfying peace.

Through the throng of officials and photographers now crowding the stage, a small, determined figure in a tweed coat appeared. Morag. She had a half-empty bottle of water in one hand and a neatly folded handkerchief in the other. She ignored the jostling cameras and the outstretched microphones, her focus singular. She reached him, surveyed the gravy-splattered mess of his face and clerical collar, and her first words to the new champion of all Scotland were spoken with the weary exasperation of a lifetime. “For goodness sake, Hamish. Sit up straight and wipe your face. You look like you’ve been wrestling a badger in a gravy boat.” She began dabbing at his chin with brisk, no-nonsense movements. The simple, practical act, so quintessentially Morag, grounded him more than any prayer. He opened his eyes and looked at her, and in her stern, unsmiling face, he saw more pride than a thousand cheering fans could ever express.

He was helped to his feet, his legs feeling like over-boiled noodles, and guided to a small podium at the centre of the stage. The magnificent golden pie dish was brought forth on a velvet cushion. It was heavier than he’d imagined, solid and real. He was handed the trophy, and he held it aloft. The crowd roared again. But he wasn’t holding it for them. He held it up to the memory of a stern, flour-dusted man, a quiet offering across the years. A chapter closed. A debt repaid. As the camera flashes popped around him, he caught one last glimpse of Angus MacLeod. His cronies were helping him off the side of the stage, his head bowed, his ‘MAULER’ shirt a testament to his messy defeat. The furious, un-Christian desire for revenge that had fuelled Hamish for two weeks had burned itself out completely. In its place was a quiet sense of closure, and the surprising, humbling realisation that perhaps the greatest victory was not in destroying your enemy, but simply in surviving him long enough to feel pity.The journey home was conducted in a state of fragile, groaning silence. Hamish sat slumped in the passenger seat, the seatbelt straining heroically across his tweed jacket. He felt like a hastily packed suitcase, overfull and on the verge of bursting. The glorious golden pie dish, now his golden pie dish, was swaddled in an old tartan blanket on the back seat, its victorious gleam hidden from view. Every bump and sway of the Morris Minor sent a gentle, queasy ripple through his digestive system, a polite but firm reminder of the twelve pies currently occupying his person. The heady scent of victory had been replaced by the less poetic aroma of indigestion, a smell he was certain was now seeping from his very pores.

Morag drove with a grim, focused competence, her knuckles white on the steering wheel. For the first twenty miles out of Edinburgh, she said nothing, her silence a dense, complex thing. Hamish, feeling the need to fill it, attempted a weak observation. “The moon is very bright tonight.” Morag glanced at him, her expression unreadable in the intermittent glow of passing streetlights. “It’s your stomach, Hamish,” she said, her voice flat. “It’s glowing. I’m surprised aircraft aren’t trying to use you as a navigation beacon.” Despite the dryness of her tone, she reached over and turned the car’s heater up a notch, a small, unspoken concession to his fragile state.

He managed a weak chuckle, which turned into a low groan. “I feel… monumental, Morag. Like a geological feature.” He rested a hand on his stomach, which felt firm and unfamiliar, a foreign country annexed in the name of glory. “I don’t think I shall ever eat again.”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” she sniffed, turning onto the quieter roads that led towards the hills. “It’s Tuesday. You’ve got Mrs. Henderson’s funeral on Thursday. There’ll be sandwiches. You’ll manage.” She paused, and her next words were softer, less barbed. “You did well, Hamish. You kept your rhythm. You didn’t panic when that great lummox started showboating.”

This, from Morag, was the equivalent of a twenty-one-gun salute. A warm feeling, entirely unrelated to gastric distress, spread through Hamish’s chest. “He looked so… defeated at the end,” Hamish said quietly, thinking of Angus’s broken expression. “All that anger, all that bluster… it just crumbled. I expected to feel triumphant, but I just felt… sad for him.”

“Hmph,” Morag grunted, a sound of profound dismissal. “Don’t waste your pity. He’s a bully who got his comeuppance. He’s probably halfway to Falkirk right now, planning how to intimidate a butcher’s competition. Some people don’t learn lessons, Hamish. They just learn who can beat them.” She was probably right, but the image of Angus’s humiliation stuck with Hamish. The victory felt strangely hollowed out by it, the pure joy complicated by the reality of another’s failure.

They arrived back in Glenfinnan well after midnight. The village was asleep, tucked under a blanket of stars and silence. The only light was the one Morag had left burning in the manse porch, a small, welcoming beacon. As she turned the car into the gravel drive, however, their headlights swept across something unexpected. Tied to the gatepost was a slightly lopsided, hand-painted banner. In wobbly green letters, it declared: ‘CONGRATULATIONS REVEREND PIE-MAN! GLENFINNAN IS PROUD!’ Below it, a small, wilting bouquet of heather had been tied with string. Hamish stared at it, a lump forming in his throat that had nothing to do with pie.

The following morning, after a night of strange, turbulent dreams filled with marching mutton pies and weeping butchers, Hamish awoke to find his newfound fame had fully permeated his parish. When he went to the post office to collect his newspaper, Mrs. Gable, a woman whose default expression was one of mild disapproval, beamed at him over the counter and pressed a crisp twenty-pound note into his hand. “My winnings, Vicar! Ten for me, ten for the church roof fund! I never doubted you for a second! You’re a credit to the community!” Young Ewan from the farm flagged him down on the street, his face alight with awe, and asked him to sign the dashboard of his tractor. It was a surreal and slightly unsettling experience. He had spent his life tending to his flock’s spiritual needs, and now he was being celebrated for an act of competitive gluttony.

The reaction from the parish council was more muted, but no less sincere. During an impromptu meeting in the vestry to discuss the leaking roof, Mr. Abernathy, a stern elder who had once taken Hamish to task over the "unseemly exuberance" of the Christmas carol service, cleared his throat and made a formal statement. “The council would like to officially minute its… profound admiration… for the vicar’s recent extracurricular achievement. It has brought a certain… notoriety… to our parish, which we hope can be channelled into our fundraising efforts.” It was a profoundly stuffy, yet deeply felt, endorsement. He was their vicar, their champion, their slightly embarrassing but ultimately beloved Pie-Man.

Later that evening, after a dinner of thin soup and a dry piece of toast that was all Morag would allow him, Hamish finally found a moment of peace. He took the golden pie dish from its tartan shroud and carried it into his study. It gleamed in the lamplight, a solid, shining testament to the madness of the past two weeks. He cleared a space on the mantelpiece, moving a stack of theological journals and a photograph of his ordination. There, his father’s small, tarnished silver medal for second place had once sat. He had packed it away when he moved into the manse, a quiet monument he no longer needed to look at every day. Now, in its place, he set down the golden dish. It was large and almost ostentatious, a triumphant shout next to the quiet whisper of his father’s failure. It didn't feel like a replacement, but a completion. He had finished the story. He looked at the trophy, then out of the window. The smirr had cleared. The great, granite shoulder of Ben Christie was sharp and clear against a purple twilight sky, solid, dependable, and real. His faith was like those hills, he’d always thought. But he knew now that even the most solid granite has veins of stranger, wilder minerals running through it.The Sunday following his victory felt different. The old stone church, usually a haven of quiet reverence, was filled with a low, expectant buzz, the kind more suited to a village fête than the morning service. It was packed. Not just the usual stalwarts in their usual pews, but faces Hamish hadn't seen since Easter, and a few he didn't recognise at all, presumably tourists who had heard tale of the pie-eating parson. As he took his place, he could feel their eyes on him, their gazes a mixture of curiosity, pride, and a vague hunger. He felt less like a spiritual guide and more like a prize-winning sow at the county fair.

When he stepped up to the pulpit, a hush fell, but it was a different kind of quiet. It was the silence of an audience waiting for the performance to begin. He looked out at the sea of faces, at Mrs. Gable giving him a surreptitious thumbs-up, at the Abernathy children whispering excitedly behind their hymn books. His carefully prepared sermon on the parable of the sower suddenly felt woefully inadequate. They hadn’t come to hear about seeds falling on stony ground; they had come to hear from the Pie-Man. Taking a deep breath, he set his notes aside.

“My dear friends, my neighbours,” he began, his voice steadier than he felt. “Some of you may be aware that I have recently returned from a… a contest. Of an esoteric nature.” A wave of soft chuckles rippled through the congregation. “And I find myself reflecting on the nature of our gifts, and the sometimes surprising paths down which they lead us.” He paused, then took the plunge. “I have been thinking, strange as it may sound, about puff pastry.” There was a collective, intrigued lean-in from the pews. “A good puff pastry requires layers. Hundreds of them. Each one, a whisper-thin sheet of dough and butter, folded and refolded. On its own, one layer is fragile, insignificant. But together… together they create something strong, yet light. Something that rises. Something magnificent.”

He was warming to his theme now, the initial awkwardness replaced by a genuine passion. “And so it is with faith. And so it is with community. Each small act of kindness, each quiet prayer, each shared moment of laughter or sorrow… they are the layers. On their own, they might seem small. But folded together, one upon the other, day after day, year after year, here in this parish… they create something strong enough to hold us all. They create a vessel for all the goodness, all the richness, all the… the meaty filling of God’s love.” He finished, slightly breathless, his tortured metaphor hanging in the air. For a moment, there was silence. Then, from the back, a single, loud ‘Amen!’ was heard from young Ewan the farmer, and the entire church broke into spontaneous, heartfelt applause. Hamish, his face flushed with a mixture of relief and embarrassment, felt he had somehow, miraculously, managed to stick the landing.

The goodwill followed him out into the churchyard after the service. He was mobbed, his hand shaken so many times he worried about repetitive strain injury. But as the crowd began to thin, Mr. Abernathy, the sternest of the church elders, cornered him by the lychgate. “A most… invigorating sermon, Vicar,” he said, his tone suggesting he was still deciding if it had been brilliant or heretical. “However, I must draw your attention to a more terrestrial matter. The leak in the vestry. During your… puff pastry peroration… a piece of plaster the size of a dinner plate detached from the ceiling and narrowly missed the communion wine. The roof is no longer a matter for concern, it is a crisis.” He handed Hamish a hastily scrawled quote from a roofer in Fort William. The number on it made Hamish’s already delicate stomach lurch. The Pie-Raiser was one thing; a roof-raiser was quite another.

The scale of this new challenge was made starkly, absurdly clear the following Tuesday morning. Hamish was in his study, contemplating the roofer’s quote with a sense of mounting dread, when a low, grinding rumble filled the air, rattling the teacup at his elbow. He and Morag rushed to the window just in time to see an articulated lorry, vast and impossibly long, attempting to negotiate the tight turn into the manse’s narrow drive. Emblazoned on its side was the elegant script of ‘McNulty’s Mill, Pride of the Borders’. The driver, a cheerful man in a dusty boiler suit, hopped down from his cab. “Morning, folks! Got a delivery for a Reverend H. Macleod. Lifetime supply of flour. Where d’you want it?”

What followed was two hours of organised chaos. A seemingly infinite river of fifty-kilogram sacks of flour was disgorged from the lorry. They filled the garden shed. They filled the coal bunker. They colonised the spare bedroom, piling up in a great, white, monolithic mountain that blotted out the light from the window. Morag stood in the hallway, her arms crossed, her face a thunderous mask of disbelief as sack after sack was carried past her. The air grew thick with a fine, white powder that settled on every surface, turning the dark wood of the manse a ghostly white. “A lifetime supply, Hamish,” she said, her voice dangerously quiet. “I see they’ve planned for your reincarnation as a commercial bakery.”

Hamish stood in the doorway of the spare room, gazing at the Everest of flour. He felt a moment of pure despair. The prize, which had been a symbol of triumph, had become a logistical nightmare. He had enough flour to bake a pie for every man, woman, and child in Scotland, with enough left over for Wales. It was ludicrous. It was absurd. It was… an opportunity. He looked at the mountain of white sacks. He thought of the gaping hole in the vestry ceiling and the terrifying number on the roofer’s quote. The two colossal problems, one of surplus, one of deficit, collided in his mind. A slow smile, the same one he’d worn when he first opened the letter from the Golden Crust, spread across his face.

He turned to Morag, his eyes shining with the manic gleam of inspiration. “Morag, don’t you see? It’s not a problem, it’s a solution! It’s the loaves and the fishes, but with flour!” Her expression suggested she was already dialling the number for the local sanatorium. “We can’t just ask for donations for the roof. But we can sell them something. We can give them a taste of the victory!” He threw his arms wide, gesturing from the mountain of flour towards the village beyond his window. “We will hold a festival! A fundraiser! We will call it the ‘Great Glenfinnan Pie-Raiser’!”

Morag stared at him. She stared at the flour-dusted furniture. She stared at the faint, white haze that now filled the entire ground floor of her meticulously polished manse. She looked back at Hamish’s beaming, hopeful, utterly daft face. A long, weary sigh escaped her, a white puff of air in the flour-filled gloom. She took off her apron, shook a cloud of dust from it, and tied it back on with a firm, decisive tug. "Right then," she said, her voice all business. "If you’re going to be baking on an industrial scale, you’ll need a better system for peeling tatties. And we’ll need to order the mutton. In bulk." The new campaign had its first recruit.The ‘Great Glenfinnan Pie-Raiser’ was a name born of desperate inspiration in a flour-filled study, but it took on a life of its own with astonishing speed. The news spread through the parish not like wildfire, but like the irresistible aroma of baking bread, seeping into every home and every conversation. Hamish, expecting he might have to persuade, cajole, and fundraise in the traditional, painful manner of church fetes, was instead met with a wave of unrestrained enthusiasm. His competitive eating had been a spectacle; this was a cause. Young Ewan, hearing the plan, immediately pledged the finest mutton from his flock at cost price, declaring it an honour to have his sheep achieve a higher calling in a championship pie. Mrs. Gable, a formidable organiser when roused, drew up a pre-order list that filled three pages of her ledger within a day, taking cash-in-hand deposits with the firm finality of a tax collector. The slightly shameful notoriety of the Pie-Man had been alchemised by the crisis of the leaky roof into a glorious, community-wide mission.

The manse, for so long a quiet haven of contemplation and lemon polish, transformed into a scene of frantic, joyous industry. It became The Pie Factory. Hamish’s study, its theological tomes now dusted with a fine layer of McNulty’s Best, was repurposed as the operational headquarters, its walls plastered with baking schedules and ingredient lists. But the true heart of the operation was the kitchen. Morag, armed with her apron and an expression of grim determination, presided over the chaos like a battlefield general. She organised the volunteers into brutally efficient teams: the ‘Tattie Peelers’, a stoic group of older men who sat on the back steps with buckets and knives, sharing village gossip as the peelings piled up; the ‘Chopping Brigade’, responsible for dicing vast mountains of onions and carrots, their work punctuated by sniffles and watery eyes; and, most prestigious of all, the ‘Crimping Corps’, a unit of women from the parish guild whose nimble fingers, honed by decades of knitting and lace-making, produced pastry edges of such exquisite, uniform perfection that Hamish felt they were works of art in themselves.

At the centre of it all was Hamish. He had abdicated his pastoral duties for the week, declaring a temporary leave of absence for ‘essential community outreach’. Covered in flour from his eyebrows to the hem of his trousers, a dishcloth tucked into his belt, he had never felt more like a priest. He was no longer just the baker’s son playing at a hobby; he was the master baker, the keeper of the sacred recipe. He moved through the bustling kitchen, a whirlwind of calm expertise. He taught a rapt group of teenagers the secret to a perfect, flaky puff pastry, explaining the science of laminating butter and dough with the same patient authority he used to explain the Holy Trinity. He showed Mr. Abernathy, who had appointed himself Chief Financial Officer and Quality Control Inspector, how to make a roux for the gravy, ensuring it was cooked to a rich, nutty brown before adding the stock. “It’s about faith, you see,” Hamish explained, stirring the pot. “You must have faith that it won’t burn, even as it darkens. That’s where the flavour lies.” Mr. Abernathy, peering into the pot, nodded thoughtfully, as if he’d just received a profound theological insight.

As the day of the Pie-Raiser dawned, the village green, situated in the shadow of the church, was a hive of activity. Trestle tables were erected, a marquee was wrestled into place, and great, insulated boxes, borrowed from a fishmonger in Mallaig, were lined up to keep the hundreds of pies piping hot. The smell was intoxicating. It billowed from the manse kitchen, it wafted from the insulated boxes, it clung to the clothes of the volunteers. It was the smell of mutton and thyme, of rich gravy and buttery pastry; it was the smell of community, effort, and imminent success. People began to arrive an hour before the official start time, clutching their pre-order tickets or waving ten-pound notes, their faces full of happy anticipation. It was less a fundraiser and more a pilgrimage. They came to buy a pie, but they also came to see the champion, to be a part of the story, to taste a piece of the victory that had put their small, quiet village on the map.

Hamish, having personally overseen the baking of the final batch at 5 a.m., stood for a moment by the church lychgate, watching the scene unfold. His body ached in muscles he didn’t know he had. There was flour in his ears. He was bone-weary, but his heart was full to bursting. He saw his parishioners not as a congregation to be preached at, but as a team, his team. He saw Morag directing the flow of customers with the efficiency of a traffic warden, a rare, small smile gracing her lips. He saw Mr. Abernathy, a metal cash box chained to his wrist, counting the proceeds with a look of grim satisfaction. He saw the children chasing each other around the green, their mouths already ringed with gravy. His golden pie dish sat on the main table, not as a trophy, but as a collection plate, already overflowing with notes and coins. He had won the contest for himself, to prove something to the ghost of his father. But this, this glorious, chaotic, pie-fuelled celebration, this was for everyone. The victory wasn't the golden dish; it was the mended roof. It was the feeling of belonging. It was the simple, profound joy of a community feeding itself.The short walk across the gravel drive to the road felt like a mile. Each crunch of his shoes seemed unnaturally loud in the quiet, drizzly afternoon. The van loomed larger as he approached, a monument to failure with peeling paint and a spiderweb crack in the windscreen. As he drew level with the driver’s door, he could see Angus clearly. He wasn’t the snarling, confident Mauler from the competition. His face was pale and puffy, with dark circles under his eyes. A two-day stubble shadowed his heavy jaw. He wore a cheap, stained fleece, and he seemed to have shrunk, the sheer force of his personality that had once made him seem enormous had vanished, leaving behind just a large, sad man. He didn’t seem to notice Hamish until the vicar tapped gently on the window. Angus startled, his head jerking up, and for a second, a flicker of the old, cornered aggression flared in his eyes. Then it vanished, replaced by a weary, almost blank resignation. He stared at Hamish for a long moment before slowly, laboriously, winding down the window.

The air that wafted out of the van was stale and smelled faintly of defeat and old takeaway boxes. “What do you want, Vicar?” Angus asked, his voice a low, gravelly rasp, utterly devoid of its former booming arrogance. It wasn’t a challenge, just a tired question. Hamish gestured back towards the manse, its windows glowing with warm, welcoming light. “It’s cold out here, Angus. And wet. Come in and have a cup of tea.” Angus stared at him, his expression a mixture of profound suspicion and disbelief. He seemed to be searching for the trick, the angle, the punchline to a cruel joke. He looked from Hamish’s face to the warm lights of the manse and back again. “Why?” he asked, the single word carrying the weight of his confusion.

“Because it’s what we do here,” Hamish said simply. “Now, are you coming in, or are you planning on taking root?” It was the tone he used on stubborn parishioners who were refusing to volunteer for the flower rota, a gentle but non-negotiable authority. To his own profound surprise, it worked. With a slow, creaking effort, as if his joints were rusted, Angus MacLeod pushed open the van door and levered himself out. He stood on the wet road, looking ill at ease, his large frame hunched against the smirr. He followed Hamish across the drive, his footsteps heavy and reluctant, like a man being led to the gallows.

When Hamish opened the door to the manse, Morag was standing in the hallway, a wooden rolling pin held loosely but purposefully in one hand. Her face was a stony mask of disapproval, her eyes fixed on Angus with an icy hostility that made the damp chill outside seem balmy. She said nothing, merely watched as Angus shuffled awkwardly into the hall, dripping onto her recently cleaned runner. “Tea, Morag, if you please,” Hamish said, trying to inject a note of cheerful normalcy into the impossibly tense atmosphere. Morag gave a single, sharp nod, turned on her heel without a word to their guest, and marched into the kitchen, the rolling pin still in her hand. Angus watched her go, a flicker of what looked like genuine fear in his eyes. “She still doesn’t like me,” he mumbled. “Morag is a fine judge of character,” Hamish replied, though he softened the blow by adding, “but she makes an excellent cup of tea. Come through to the study.”

The study, with its comforting scent of books and polish, seemed to shrink around Angus’s bulk. He refused to sit, hovering near the door as if poised for flight, his huge hands hanging awkwardly at his sides. Hamish gestured to the mantelpiece. “Your trophy,” Angus said, his voice flat. He looked at the gleaming golden pie dish, not with envy, but with a kind of morbid fascination, like a motorist gazing at the wreckage of his own car. “You beat me. You properly beat me.” He shook his head slowly. “Everyone saw it. I went from being ‘The Mauler’ to a laughing stock overnight. The regulars at the pub started calling me ‘The Crumb’. The business… MacLeod’s Meats… it was built on my reputation. The strongman. The winner. When that went, everything else started to fall apart. Lost the big contract with the pub chain. Had to let my staff go. I’m selling the shop.” He delivered this monologue in a dead, emotionless tone, staring at the golden dish as if it were the source of all his woes.

Morag entered with a tray. On it were two cups of tea and a plate. On the plate were two thick slices of plain, unbuttered bread. She set the tray down on the desk with a thud, giving Angus a look that suggested the bread was offered under extreme duress and might well be poisoned. Angus glanced at the bread, then looked away, as if the very sight of food was an affront. The silence stretched, thick and uncomfortable. Hamish knew he had to say something, to offer some pastoral platitude about God’s plan or new beginnings, but the words felt hollow and false. Instead, he asked a simple question. “Why did you come here, Angus?” Angus finally tore his gaze from the trophy and looked at Hamish. His eyes, for the first time, seemed to focus. “That last pie,” he said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “The steak pie. It was… it was good. Really good. Not like the factory-made rubbish they usually have. The pastry… and the gravy… It tasted… real.” He swallowed hard, a muscle working in his jaw. “It tasted like the one my mother used to make. Before she left.” The confession, so unexpected and so deeply personal, hung in the quiet study, utterly devastating in its simple sincerity. The bully, the Mauler, had been defeated not by volume, but by a memory. A taste of a home he had lost.

Angus reached into the pocket of his fleece and pulled out a crumpled, greasy piece of paper. It was a newspaper clipping, a story from a local Edinburgh paper about the Pie-Raiser, complete with a picture of a beaming, flour-dusted Hamish holding a tray of his creations. “I read this,” Angus said, smoothing the paper on the desk. “‘Vicar’s Secret Recipe Saves Church.’ It says here you baked them all yourself. The winning recipe.” He looked up, and for the first time, Hamish saw not a bully or a failure, but a desperate, drowning man. “I’m not here for money. I’m not here for a fight,” Angus said, his voice cracking with a shame he could no longer conceal. “I’m here to ask you… I need you… to teach me how to make that pie.”The silence in the study was no longer merely uncomfortable; it was a living thing, dense and heavy with the weight of Angus’s confession. It pressed in on them, thick with the ghosts of a miserable childhood, a lifetime of resentment, and the unexpected, pathetic tragedy of a grown man undone by a piece of pastry. The crumpled newspaper clipping lay on the desk between them, a fragile truce flag planted in the middle of a forty-year war. Hamish looked from Angus’s broken face to the golden pie dish on the mantelpiece. The trophy, once a symbol of glorious, righteous victory, now seemed almost cruel in its triumphant gleam. It was a monument to a battle he had won, only to discover the enemy was already a casualty long before the first shot was fired.

In that moment, a lifetime of animosity rearranged itself in Hamish’s mind. He saw Angus not as the hulking, cruel tormentor, but as a boy. A boy whose mother had left, taking with her the taste of home, of comfort, of love. He saw that same boy on the sports field, his face smeared with gravy, stealing a pie. And for the first time, Hamish understood it not as an act of pure, malicious bullying, but as a desperate, clumsy, and cruel attempt to seize a scrap of the comfort he had lost from a boy who, in Angus’s eyes, still had it all. The stolen pie wasn't just a stolen lunch; it was an act of profound, twisted envy. The fury that had simmered in Hamish for decades did not just cool; it evaporated, leaving behind a vast, empty space that was slowly, painfully, being filled by a sense of profound, priestly obligation. This was no longer about revenge or justice. This was a soul in need of nourishment.

Before Hamish could formulate a response, the silence was shattered by a sharp, incredulous laugh from the doorway. “Absolutely not,” Morag said. She stepped fully into the room, placing herself between Hamish and Angus, a small, furious bastion of common sense. The rolling pin was no longer held loosely; it was gripped. “Have you taken complete leave of your senses, Hamish? Look at him! He comes sniffing around here with a sob story, and you’re ready to hand him the keys to the kingdom? He doesn’t want to learn. He wants to steal. He wants your recipe, the one thing you have, your father’s legacy, so he can slap it in a plastic box and make a fortune. It’s the same thing he’s always done. He sees something good, and he takes it.” Her voice was laced with a contempt so pure it was almost beautiful.

Angus flinched under the barrage of her words as if he’d been physically struck. He didn’t argue. He didn’t protest. He simply looked at the floor, his broad shoulders slumping even further, a tacit admission of the truth in her accusation. He had spent his life taking. It was all he knew. “She’s right,” he mumbled, his voice thick. “Everything she says. It’s what I am. What I was.” He looked up at Hamish, his eyes pleading. “But I’m telling you the truth now. I’ve got nothing left to lose by it.”

Hamish looked from Angus’s wretched face to Morag’s righteous fury. He held up a hand, a gesture for peace. “Morag, please,” he said gently. He then turned his full attention to Angus. The path forward was terrifyingly clear. It was the most difficult, the most unpalatable, and the most Christian thing he could possibly do. It was, he realised, the true test of his ministry, far more so than any sermon he had ever preached. “A recipe is just a list of instructions, Angus. It’s words on a page. The secret to a good pie isn’t in the recipe.” He paused, letting the words sink in. “It’s in the hands that make it. It’s about patience. It’s about respect for the ingredients. It’s about understanding that you are not just making food; you are creating comfort. That cannot be stolen. It can only be learned.”

A flicker of hope, fragile and tentative as a new shoot in frozen ground, ignited in Angus’s eyes. He took a half-step forward. “Then… you’ll teach me?” Hamish nodded slowly, sealing his fate. “I will. But on my terms. This isn’t a business transaction. Consider it an apprenticeship. A penance, if you like.” He saw Morag recoil in horror out of the corner of his eye, but he did not waver. “Be here tomorrow morning. Six o’clock. Come to the back door of the kitchen. And wear old clothes. Your first lesson has nothing to do with pastry. It has to do with peeling a sack of potatoes. We’ll see if you still want to learn after that.”

For a long moment, Angus just stared, his mouth slightly agape, unable to process the verdict. He had come expecting mockery, rejection, perhaps even violence. He had been offered grace, conditional and heavily supervised, but grace all the same. He nodded once, a jerky, uncoordinated movement, unable to form words. “Six o’clock,” he rasped, then turned and shambled out of the study and out of the manse, closing the front door with a quiet click that echoed the closing of a chapter in both their lives. Hamish was left alone in the study with Morag and the full weight of what he had just done. She stared at him for a long, silent moment, her face a storm cloud of disapproval. “You are a good man, Hamish Macleod,” she said finally, her voice tight with barely suppressed rage. “And you are the biggest fool in all of Christendom. When he makes off with the church silver, don’t come crying to me.” She turned and marched from the room, leaving Hamish alone with the golden pie dish, the plate of untouched bread, and the terrifying, exhilarating prospect of sunrise.The night was long and filled with the ghosts of bad decisions. Hamish slept in fits and starts, waking often with the distinct, gut-wrenching certainty that he had made a terrible, irredeemable error. He dreamt that Angus had stolen the church bells, melting them down to make a giant, malevolent pie dish. He dreamt that Morag had packed her bags and left, leaving only a note that read, ‘Told you so.’ By five-thirty, sleep was a lost cause. He rose in the pre-dawn gloom and went down to the kitchen. It was cold, the flagstones chilling his bare feet through his slippers. The lingering, phantom scent of the Pie-Raiser had been replaced by the sharp, clean smell of Morag’s disinfectant. He put the kettle on, the familiar rumble a small comfort in the profound quiet, and waited.

He didn’t know if Angus would come. Part of him, the sensible part that sounded remarkably like his cousin, desperately hoped he wouldn’t. It would be an embarrassment, a failed gesture, but it would be a clean break. The larger part of him, the part that wore a dog collar, prayed that he would. The tick of the kitchen clock was a slow, deliberate torture. 5:58. 5:59. At precisely six o’clock, as the first, watery grey light began to silhouette the hills, he heard the crunch of heavy boots on the gravel of the back drive. Not the swagger of The Mauler, but the slow, hesitant tread of a man walking a long, green mile. A moment later, a single, soft knock came at the back door. Hamish took a breath, opened it, and let his penance begin.

Angus looked even worse in the thin morning light. His face was blotchy, his eyes were bloodshot, and he clutched a thin, worn-out jacket around himself as if it were his last worldly possession. He smelled of damp wool and desperation. He said nothing, merely looked at Hamish, his expression that of a stray dog expecting to be kicked. Hamish stood aside. “You’re on time,” he said, his voice more gentle than he’d intended. “That’s a start.” Angus shuffled into the kitchen, his huge frame dwarfing the space. From the corner, where she was ostentatiously polishing a copper pot, came a sound from Morag. It was not quite a cough and not quite a sniff, but a small, perfectly calibrated noise of pure, undiluted disapproval. She did not look at Angus, but her presence was a third, hostile entity in the room.

Hamish ignored her, for his own sanity. He pointed to a small wooden stool in the corner, next to which sat a formidable hessian sack. “There,” he said. “Your station.” He handed Angus a bucket for the peelings and a small, wickedly sharp vegetable peeler. “Your task is to peel every potato in that sack. The peeled ones go in the sink. Try not to take half the potato off with the skin. Waste is a sin.” Angus stared at the peeler in his huge, scarred butcher’s hand. It looked like a child’s toy. He looked at the sack of potatoes, then at Hamish, his face a mask of weary confusion, as if he had expected a lecture or a prayer book, not a mundane kitchen chore. But he asked no questions. He sat on the stool, which groaned under his weight, grabbed the first potato, and began to work.

It was painful to watch. Angus attacked the potato with the same brute force he had used on the pies at the competition. He gouged and hacked at it, great chunks of white flesh flying into the bucket along with the peel. His movements were clumsy, angry, and frustrated. The peeler, designed for finesse, skittered and slipped in his grip. After five minutes, he had mangled three potatoes and had a growing pile of wasted starch at his feet. Morag, still polishing the same spot on the pot, made another small sound, this one of triumphant scorn. Hamish let out a slow sigh and pulled up another stool, sitting opposite Angus. He took a potato from the sack and picked up his own peeler. “Not like that,” he said quietly. “You’re fighting it. Don’t fight it. Guide it.”

Without another word, Hamish began to peel. His hands moved with a steady, practiced rhythm. The blade whispered against the skin, shaving off a single, continuous, paper-thin ribbon of peel that spiralled into the bucket. It was an act of quiet efficiency, of respect for the tool and the vegetable. He finished one potato, then another, his movements fluid and economical. Angus stopped his frantic hacking and just watched, his knuckles white where he gripped his own peeler. He watched the effortless way Hamish turned the potato in his hand, the way his thumb guided the blade, the sheer, maddening competence of it all. He was being shown up, not by a rival strongman, but by a country vicar peeling a spud. The humiliation was a fresh, sharp sting.

For an hour, they worked in near silence, the only sounds the rhythmic rasp of Hamish’s peeler, the clumsy scraping of Angus’s, and the occasional, pointed clatter of a pot from Morag’s side of the kitchen. The pile of perfectly peeled potatoes in the sink grew steadily, the vast majority of them from Hamish. Angus’s contributions were a lumpy, gouged minority. He was sweating, his fleece discarded on the floor, his brow furrowed in a state of profound, primal concentration. But slowly, almost imperceptibly, something began to shift. Driven by sheer repetition, his movements became less aggressive. He stopped trying to force the blade and began to let it find its own path. The ribbons of peel coming off his potatoes were still thick, still broken, but they were no longer crude chunks. He had found a rhythm, clumsy and halting, but a rhythm nonetheless.

By the time the sack was empty, the morning sun was streaming through the kitchen window and the clock on the wall showed nearly eight-thirty. Angus’s hands were raw, and his back ached from hunching over on the small stool. He looked at the mountain of peeled potatoes in the sink, then at his own sore, blistered hands, and a strange expression crossed his face. It wasn’t pride, not yet, but it was a look of weary, sullen accomplishment. He had been given a task, and he had finished it. He had not run. He had not broken. He had peeled. Hamish stood up and stretched his own back. “Well done,” he said. The praise was simple, unadorned, but it seemed to land on Angus with a physical weight. He looked up at Hamish, his eyes questioning, as if expecting a catch.

There was none. “Same time tomorrow,” Hamish said, already rinsing the peelers in the sink. “Tomorrow, we tackle the onions. It’s best to get the weeping out of the way early.” He handed Angus a clean, dry cloth for his hands. Angus took it, wiping his hands slowly, his gaze distant. He looked over at Morag, who was now kneading a batch of dough on the counter, her back pointedly turned to him. He opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it. With a single, jerky nod to Hamish, he turned and walked out the back door, his footsteps on the gravel seeming a fraction lighter, a fraction less defeated, than when he had arrived.

Hamish watched him go, then sank onto a kitchen chair, suddenly bone-weary. Morag finished her kneading, covered the dough with a cloth, and finally turned to face him. She walked over to the bucket of peelings from Angus’s station and picked through it with a critical finger. “He’s wasted a good stone’s worth of potato,” she declared, her voice crisp. “The man peels a potato like he’s trying to kill it. This is a fool’s errand, Hamish.” Hamish met her gaze, his own eyes tired but firm. “Perhaps,” he said. “But he stayed. And he peeled. And he’s coming back tomorrow.” He looked at the mountain of naked potatoes in the sink, gleaming in the morning sun. “And for today,” he added with a faint smile, “that is more than enough.”The onion ordeal was worse than the potatoes. As Hamish had predicted, it involved weeping, but not the cathartic, healing kind. It was a raw, stinging, involuntary misery. Angus, hunched over a chopping board with a mountain of onions before him, found his eyes streaming within minutes. He blinked furiously, trying to ward off the sting, but it only intensified. The tears were not of sorrow, but of sheer, chemical-driven agony, and they infuriated him. He scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his massive hand, which only smeared the pungent oils across his face, creating a mask of burning pain. He swore, a low, guttural curse that was swallowed by the cavernous quiet of the kitchen. From her post by the stove, Morag let out a small, satisfied sniff and turned the page of her newspaper with a crisp rustle.

Hamish, watching the large man’s pathetic, tear-streaked battle, took pity on him. He lit a candle and placed it on the chopping board, a trick his father had taught him. “The flame draws in the vapours,” he explained quietly. “It helps. A little.” He then adjusted Angus’s grip on the knife. “You’re holding it like a club, Angus. It’s a tool, not a weapon. Let the weight of the blade do the work. And for pity’s sake, stop rubbing your eyes. You look like a bear who’s been pepper-sprayed.” Angus glowered at him through his tears, but he adjusted his grip, mimicking Hamish’s. He tried to focus on the rhythmic chop, on the clean slide of the blade through the layers of the onion. The tears still flowed, but beneath the sting of the onions, another, older weeping seemed to be taking place, a quiet, internal release for which he had no words.

The days fell into a strange, monastic routine. The manse kitchen became a silent monastery, and the making of the pie its central liturgy. After the onions came the carrots, a lesson in precision and uniformity that nearly drove Angus to madness. His great, thick fingers struggled to produce the neat, small dice Hamish insisted upon, his efforts looking more like rubble than jewels. Then came the meat. Here, for the first time, Angus was on familiar ground. Hamish presented him with a great shoulder of mutton from Ewan’s farm, and for the first time since he had walked into the kitchen, Angus’s hands moved with an innate confidence. The butcher re-emerged, but a different one. Guided by Hamish’s quiet instructions, he wasn't just breaking down a carcass; he was trimming the fat with care, separating muscle from sinew with a surgeon’s respect, cutting the meat into perfect, bite-sized cubes. He was using his old skills for a new purpose, not for profit, but for a higher, more patient craft.

Morag remained a hostile, silent observer to the whole affair. She moved around the kitchen with the brisk efficiency of a storm front, her disapproval a palpable force. She would place a cup of tea down for Angus without a word, setting it just out of his comfortable reach. She would inspect his chopped vegetables with a withering glance before sweeping them into the pot. She never spoke to him directly, referring to him only in the third person when speaking to Hamish. “Tell your apprentice he’s left gristle on the chopping board,” she would say, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. Angus, to his credit, never rose to the bait. He accepted her silent scorn as part of his penance, ducking his head and cleaning the board without a word, his quiet submission seeming to infuriate her more than any argument would have.

The true test, the crucible of his apprenticeship, came a week into his training. It was time to make the pastry. Hamish laid out the ingredients with the reverence of a priest preparing for communion: a block of cold, unsalted butter, a bag of McNulty’s finest flour from the terrifying mountain in the spare room, salt, and iced water. “This is where the magic happens, Angus,” Hamish said softly. “Puff pastry is an act of faith. It’s a conversation between the fat and the flour.” Angus looked at the simple ingredients, then at his own huge, clumsy hands, and a deep-seated despair settled over him. He could break down a bullock, but the thought of creating something so delicate seemed an insurmountable challenge.

Hamish demonstrated first, his movements economical and precise. He incorporated the butter into the flour, creating a shaggy, uneven dough. He rolled it out, folded it like a letter, turned it, and rolled again. Turn, fold, roll. Chill. Turn, fold, roll. It was a mantra, a slow, repetitive dance. “You are creating layers,” he explained, his voice a low murmur. “Hundreds of them. Each fold doubles the number. You are trapping the air, trapping the potential. You rush it, the butter will melt and the layers will merge. You handle it too much, the dough will become tough. You must be firm, but gentle. You must be patient.” He handed the rolling pin to Angus. It looked like a toothpick in his grasp. Angus dusted his hands with flour, took a deep breath, and began. His first attempt was a disaster. He pressed too hard, his years of strongman training betraying him. The butter burst through the dough in greasy streaks. The dough stuck to the rolling pin. He swore, his frustration boiling over, and he slammed his fist onto the flour-dusted counter, sending up a white cloud of failure. Morag, from her corner, let out a sound that was dangerously close to a chuckle. Angus looked ready to tear the kitchen apart.

Hamish said nothing. He simply scraped up the ruined dough, threw it in the bin, and measured out a fresh batch of flour. He didn’t chide or console. He simply waited. Angus stared at the bin, then at the fresh flour, his chest heaving. The desire to quit, to walk out the door and never come back, was a physical force. But the memory of his own ruined face reflected in the golden pie dish, the taste of that perfect pie, the flicker of hope Hamish had offered—it was just enough to keep him there. He washed his hands, took another deep breath, and started again. This time, he was different. He was hesitant, gentle. He handled the dough as if it were a new-born bird. His movements were clumsy, ponderous, but they were careful. He rolled, he folded, he turned. It was an agonisingly slow process. He worked with a concentration so profound that beads of sweat stood out on his forehead, mingling with the flour. At the end of it, he had a small, lumpy, uneven, but structurally sound block of pastry. It was a pathetic thing compared to Hamish’s perfect rectangle, but it was his. He had not broken it. He had created it. He looked at it, then at Hamish, a silent question in his exhausted eyes. Hamish inspected the dough, prodding it gently with a floury finger. He nodded slowly. “It will bake,” he said. It was the highest praise he had yet offered.The day of the bake arrived cloaked in a tense, reverent silence. The kitchen, scrubbed clean and organised by Morag with military precision, felt less like a domestic space and more like an operating theatre. On the counter, the chilled, lumpy block of Angus’s pastry sat next to Hamish’s perfect, pale rectangle. The slow-braised mutton filling, rich and dark and fragrant with thyme, was ready in a large bowl. All the separate elements of the past week’s labour were now waiting to be unified, to be given their final form. Angus stood before the floured countertop, his hands washed raw, his expression a tight knot of anxiety and desperate hope. He had peeled, chopped, stewed, and folded. He had submitted to the tyranny of the peeler and the patient geometry of the rolling pin. Now came the final, terrifying assembly.

“The dish is a vessel, but it is also a frame,” Hamish said, his voice quiet in the charged atmosphere. He handed Angus a ceramic pie dish. “The pastry must honour it.” Under Hamish’s watchful eye, Angus began the delicate process of rolling out the bottom crust. His movements were still ponderous, but they were no longer aggressive. He eased the dough into the dish, his thick fingers, so accustomed to tearing and breaking, now coaxing and pressing the pastry into the corners with a newfound, almost fearful gentleness. He filled the dish with the rich, dark mutton mixture, the smell rising up to meet him, a scent not just of food, but of his own long, arduous week of toil. There was a quiet satisfaction in the simple act of filling the void, of giving the frame its picture.

The true challenge was the lid. After carefully laying the top layer of pastry over the filling, it was time for the crimping. Hamish demonstrated the traditional, fluted edge, his fingers moving with a deft, practiced elegance. Angus watched, his own hands looking like useless slabs of meat by comparison. He knew he could not replicate such delicacy. He picked up a fork, the tines looking tiny and inadequate, and began to press them into the rim. He didn't try to be fancy. He worked his way around the edge with a slow, methodical pressure, creating a simple, honest, deeply-grooved seal. It wasn’t elegant. It wasn’t the work of a master baker. It was the work of a butcher: functional, strong, and without pretence. It was his signature. When he was done, Hamish handed him a small brush and a bowl of beaten egg. “Give it a wash,” he instructed. “For colour. For pride.” Angus painted the pale lid with the golden egg wash, the final benediction before the trial by fire.

The preheated oven gaped like the mouth of hell. With infinite care, as if handling a priceless artefact, Hamish helped Angus slide the pie onto the middle rack. He closed the door with a soft, decisive click. The act was done. It was out of their hands now, in the care of thermodynamics and faith. An hour-long vigil began. Angus, unable to settle, paced the kitchen floor, a caged bear in a floral apron. Hamish sat at the table with a book of psalms, though he didn't turn a single page. Morag, who had been observing the entire process with the silent, hawkish attention of a hanging judge, did something unexpected. She poured three cups of tea. She placed one in front of Hamish. Then, she walked over to Angus, who had frozen mid-pace, and placed a cup directly on the corner of the table nearest him. “You’ll wear a trench in my linoleum,” she said, her voice devoid of its usual acid. It was not kindness, not quite, but it was an acknowledgement of his existence, a recognition of his shared anxiety. It was, from Morag, a seismic event.

When the timer finally shrilled, all three of them started. The hour had passed in a state of suspended animation. Hamish rose, put on a pair of thick oven gloves, and with a sense of high ceremony, opened the oven door. A blast of glorious, savoury heat washed into the kitchen. And there it sat. It wasn’t a perfect pie. It was a little lopsided, where one side had risen more enthusiastically than the other. The fork-crimped edge was rustic and slightly uneven. But it was magnificent. It was a deep, burnished gold, the pastry puffed high and proud, and from a small slit in the centre, a single, triumphant bead of gravy sizzled. It had not collapsed. It had not burned. It had, against all odds, baked. Angus stared at it, his mouth agape, a look of profound, uncomprehending awe on his face. He had made a thing of beauty.

They sat at the kitchen table, the pie enthroned in its centre, steam whispering from its victorious crust. The silence now was one of reverence. Hamish took up a knife and made the first cut. The sound of the blade breaking through the crisp pastry was a small, satisfying crackle, a sound of success. He served three slices, one for each of them. Angus stared at the slice on his plate. He could see the layers in the pastry, the dark, rich filling, the sturdy, hand-crimped wall holding it all together. It was his work, made solid and real. He picked up his fork, his hand trembling slightly, and took the first bite.

The flavour was overwhelming. It was the taste of mutton and thyme, of rich, slow-cooked gravy, and the buttery, flaky crunch of the pastry. But it was more than that. It was the taste of a week of peeled potatoes and wept-over onions. It was the taste of patience, of humility, of painstaking effort. It tasted of redemption. And as the warmth spread through him, a single, hot tear escaped his eye and rolled down his cheek, tracing a clean path through the flour dust that still clung to his skin. It was not a tear of pain or of shame. It was a tear of pure, unadulterated release. He had not just made a pie; he had tasted a piece of a life he never thought he could have.

He looked up, expecting to see mockery or pity. Hamish was smiling, a quiet, knowing smile. But it was Morag’s expression that he would remember. She had taken a small, critical bite of her own slice. She chewed it slowly, her eyes narrowed in concentration, analysing it for flaws. She swallowed, dabbed her lips with a napkin, and delivered her verdict. “The crust is a little dense on the south side,” she announced, as if reading from a formal report. Angus’s face fell. She paused, then added, “But the seasoning is correct. And it hasn’t got a soggy bottom.” She took another, larger bite. It was the most profound compliment Angus MacLeod had ever received.

Later, after the plates had been cleared and the last crumbs consumed, Hamish went into his study. He returned not with a photocopied sheet, but with a small, slim, leather-bound notebook, its pages yellowed and softened with age and use. The handwriting inside was a stern, spidery script, the ink faded from black to a soft brown. “My father’s,” Hamish said, placing it in Angus’s hands. “He was a better baker than I’ll ever be. He never wrote much down, but what he did, he wrote in here.” Angus held the book as if it were the crown jewels, his rough fingers tracing the worn leather. “A recipe is just a starting point, Angus,” Hamish said, looking at the man who was no longer his nemesis, but his student. “The rest… the rest is up to you.” Angus looked from the precious book to Hamish’s face, his own eyes clear for the first time in a week. He couldn’t speak. He just nodded, a deep and solemn acknowledgement of a gift far greater than a list of ingredients. The apprenticeship was over. A baker had been born.Autumn painted the glens in shades of rust and gold, and a quiet, comfortable rhythm returned to life in Glenfinnan-by-the-Loch. The Great Glenfinnan Pie-Raiser was now the stuff of local legend, a tale to be told and embellished over pints at the pub. The church roof was gloriously, beautifully, and expensively mended, no longer threatening the communion wine with impromptu baptism by plaster dust. The mountain of flour in the spare room had been reduced to a mere foothill, and the manse kitchen had been scrubbed back to its former state of gleaming, lemon-scented order. The golden pie dish still sat on the study mantelpiece, but its triumphant gleam had softened. It was less a trophy of personal conquest and more a fond reminder of a time when the entire village had come together, bound by a common purpose and an uncommon amount of mutton.

Hamish felt the change in himself. The old, nagging wound of his rivalry with Angus had healed over, leaving not a scar but a strange sense of peace. He had faced his demon, and in an act that still made his sensible cousin shake her head in disbelief, he had offered it a cup of tea and the secrets to his father’s pastry. Since the day Angus had left with the little leather-bound notebook, there had been no word. For the first few weeks, Hamish had been plagued by a low-grade anxiety, a fear that Morag’s dire predictions would come true, that he would see his family’s recipe mass-produced and cheapened, sold from the back of a van emblazoned with a snarling caricature of ‘The Mauler’. But as the months passed with only silence, the anxiety faded, replaced by a quiet, hopeful faith. He had planted a seed in the most stony of ground; he could only trust it had found a way to grow.

The letter arrived on a crisp Tuesday morning, tucked between a flyer for sheep dip and a bill from the electricity board. It was a plain, brown envelope, the address written in a blocky, unfamiliar hand. There was no crest, no embossed lettering. Hamish opened it with a curious thumb. The paper inside was a single sheet torn from a cheap notepad, the message brutally concise. It read: ‘I have a shop. The old market road in Falkirk. It’s called The Honest Pie. If you are ever passing.’ There was no other greeting, no signature but the one Hamish could infer. He read the note twice, a slow, wide smile spreading across his face. He passed it to Morag, who was sorting the post with her usual suspicious efficiency. She read it, her lips pursed, and sniffed. “An invitation, is it? Or a summons to witness his first bankruptcy hearing?”

“It’s a report, Morag,” Hamish said, his voice warm with satisfaction. “It’s proof of progress. The Honest Pie. It’s the perfect name.” He looked out the window, his gaze distant. “Falkirk. We should go.” Morag looked at him as if he’d suggested they take up Morris dancing. “Drive halfway across Scotland to look at a pie shop? On the off-chance he hasn’t just set up a front for some new villainy? I have better things to do with my time, Hamish. There are curtains that need hemming.” But Hamish knew his cousin. Her curiosity, though she would rather be boiled in oil than admit it, was as potent as her cynicism. “It will be a nice day out,” he coaxed. “We can see the Kelpies. And besides,” he added, playing his trump card, “aren’t you just a little bit interested to see if I was a fool?”

The drive to Falkirk was a reversal of their previous journeys. They were not heading towards conflict or competition, but towards a question mark. Morag, true to form, maintained a running commentary of doubt. “He’ll be selling them for a pound apiece, you’ll see. Using lard instead of butter. The man has no more sense of quality than a slug.” Hamish just smiled and watched the landscape change from the rugged grandeur of the highlands to the flatter, more industrial sprawl of the central belt. They found the old market road without difficulty, a slightly down-at-heel street of mechanics’ workshops, hardware suppliers, and small, independent shops. And there, nestled between a tyre fitter and a plumber’s merchant, was a small, unassuming storefront. A new, hand-painted sign in simple, dark green letters hung above the door: ‘The Honest Pie’. There was no cartoon butcher, no aggressive logo. Just the name.

The shop was tiny, no bigger than Hamish’s study. But it was spotlessly clean. The floor was swept, the glass counter gleamed, and the air within smelled glorious. It was the rich, deep, comforting scent of slow-cooked meat and perfectly baked pastry. Behind the counter, a chalkboard listed the day’s offerings: ‘Mutton & Thyme’, ‘Steak & Ale’, ‘Chicken & Leek’. At a small, flour-dusted workspace at the back of the shop, a large figure in a clean white apron stood with his back to them, his shoulders hunched in concentration as he meticulously crimped the edge of a pie. It was Angus. He worked with a quiet, focused intensity, his movements slow and deliberate. A woman with a pram came in, and Angus turned. The change in him was staggering. The bullish aggression was gone. His face, though still heavy-featured, was calmer, the lines of anger and frustration smoothed away. He greeted the woman with a quiet nod. “The usual, Mary?” She smiled. “Aye, Angus. The wee one loves your chicken pie. He’ll eat nothing else.” Angus carefully placed a warm pie in a paper bag, his movements gentle. “Best let it cool a bit for him,” he said, his voice a low, soft rumble. It was a simple, unremarkable transaction, yet Hamish and Morag watched it as if it were a miracle.

Angus handed the woman her change, and as she left, his eyes fell upon the two figures standing hesitantly in the doorway. He froze, a pie tray held halfway to the warming oven. The colour drained from his face, and for a second, he looked like the terrified apprentice from his first day in Hamish’s kitchen. Then, a slow, shy, almost pained smile touched his lips. He put the tray down and wiped his floury hands on his apron, a gesture Hamish now knew so well. “You came,” he said, his voice thick with an emotion he couldn’t name. “I didn’t know if you would.” Hamish stepped forward, his own smile radiant. “We were passing,” he said, the lie gentle and obvious. “The shop looks wonderful, Angus. Absolutely wonderful.” Morag, for her part, said nothing. She was too busy inspecting the pies behind the glass counter, her eyes narrowed, searching for flaws, for soggy bottoms, for any sign that her cynicism was justified. She found none. The pies were perfect. Golden, proud, and impeccably crimped.

Angus seemed to swell with a quiet, humble pride under Hamish’s praise. “It’s not much,” he said, gesturing around the small shop. “But it’s mine. All mine. I bake every morning. I sell out by three most days. People… people seem to like them.” He picked up the slim leather notebook from the counter beside him. It was worn, its cover softened, its pages filled with new notes in his own blocky script. He had not just copied the recipes; he had learned from them, adapted them, made them his own. “Your father’s book,” he said, holding it with reverence. “I keep it here. For luck. For a reminder.” He looked at Hamish, his gaze direct and filled with a profound, unspoken gratitude. Then, he reached under the counter and brought out a heavy, cloth-wrapped parcel. “I have something for you,” he said, his voice suddenly shy. “It’s not… it’s not much of a thank you for… for everything. But I wanted you to have it.”

He placed the parcel on the counter. Hamish unwrapped the cloth. Inside was a pie dish. It was not gold or silver, but a simple, sturdy piece of earthenware, dark blue and beautifully glazed. It was the kind of dish a baker would use every day, solid, dependable, and made to last a lifetime. Tucked inside the dish was a plain white envelope. Hamish looked at Angus, a question in his eyes. Angus just nodded for him to open it. With a feeling of gentle curiosity, Hamish tore open the envelope and pulled out the single folded sheet inside. It was a cheque, made out not to Hamish Macleod, but to the ‘Glenfinnan Church Roof Fund’. The amount written on it was precise, and instantly recognisable. It was the exact, eye-watering sum from the roofer’s original quote. A full and complete repayment. Hamish stared at the cheque, the numbers blurring for a moment. He looked up at the quiet, transformed man behind the counter, the man who had peeled potatoes in his kitchen, who now stood proudly in his own clean, honest shop.

On the long drive home, as the industrial towns gave way once more to the rolling hills and the open sky, the silence in the car was different. It was not tense or weary, but thoughtful, reflective. Hamish held the heavy, earthenware dish on his lap, its solid presence a comfort. Finally, as they caught their first glimpse of the familiar, majestic smudge of Ben Christie against the evening sky, Morag spoke. “Well,” she said, her eyes fixed firmly on the road ahead. “I suppose he didn’t steal the recipe.” She paused, downshifting for the turn towards the village. “The crust on that chicken pie looked a little pale. He could have given it another two minutes in the oven.” Hamish smiled. It was the closest Morag would ever come to admitting she had witnessed a miracle. For Hamish, the day had been a revelation. The victory in Edinburgh had vanquished a demon from his past, but the quiet, humble shop in Falkirk had done something far more profound. It had proven that grace, offered in the most unlikely of circumstances, could be a recipe for redemption. And that, he thought, was a truth far more satisfying than any prize, a theology more nourishing than any pie he had ever tasted.The earthenware dish found its home not on the mantelpiece, but on the sturdy Welsh dresser in the kitchen, nestled between Morag’s willow-patterned serving plates. It sat there for several weeks, a quiet, unassuming presence. The golden trophy, in the study, was a monument to a past victory, a bright, loud declaration of a singular achievement. But the dark blue dish was different. It was a tool. It was a promise. It felt like a living piece of correspondence, a continuing conversation between two men who had once been enemies and were now, improbably, colleagues in a shared and sacred craft. Hamish would sometimes run a hand over its smooth, cool glaze, feeling its solid, reassuring weight, and a sense of profound, quiet rightness would settle over him.

Life returned to its gentle, predictable cadence. Hamish wrote his sermons, visited the elderly, and chaired the church council meetings, which were now blessedly free of any discussion about leaks. His brief, blazing celebrity as the Pie-Man had faded, leaving behind only a warm, affectionate glow. He was once again simply the vicar, albeit one who was now occasionally stopped in the street and asked for his opinion on the correct ratio of suet to flour in a shortcrust pastry. He found he didn’t mind at all. It was a form of pastoral care he was uniquely qualified to give, a ministry of comfort through carbohydrates.

One Tuesday evening, with the wind howling a lonely tune around the corners of the manse and a persistent, cold rain lashing against the study windows, Hamish felt a familiar stirring. He had just finished a small, worthy, but ultimately uninspiring supper of poached haddock and steamed kale that Morag had served with the stern air of a medical professional. He looked out at the dark, wet world, and the unwavering belief that God, in His infinite wisdom, had a particular fondness for a well-made meat pie reasserted itself with the force of a revelation. He stood up, a decision made. “Morag,” he called out, heading for the kitchen. “I think we have some steak and kidney in the freezer.”

She was sitting at the kitchen table, mending one of his socks with fierce, tiny stitches. She looked up, her expression one of weary inquiry. “And what about it?” she asked. Hamish walked over to the dresser and took down the dark blue earthenware dish. He held it in both hands. “I think,” he said, a slow smile spreading across his face, “it’s time we put this to use. I’m going to bake a pie. Just a pie. For supper tomorrow.” Morag put down her sewing. She looked at the dish in his hands, then at his face. A hundred different objections, sarcasms, and warnings seemed to flicker in her eyes and then subside. She gave a small, almost imperceptible shrug. “Well,” she said, her voice neutral. “The steak will need to thaw. Best take it out now.” It was the closest she would ever come to giving her blessing.

The next afternoon, the kitchen was once again filled with the smells of baking, but it was a different atmosphere entirely from the frantic industry of the Pie-Raiser. It was calm, unhurried, and domestic. Hamish worked not from his father’s hallowed book, nor from his own competition-honed techniques, but from memory, from instinct. He rolled out the pastry with a light touch, the rhythmic thud of the rolling pin a gentle counterpoint to the rain still tapping against the window. He didn’t measure the thyme but crumbled it between his fingers, letting his nose tell him when it was enough. Morag worked alongside him in a comfortable, unspoken partnership, peeling and boiling potatoes for mash, her movements as efficient and familiar as a prayer. They did not speak much, but the silence was a companionable one, woven from years of shared space and a mutual understanding of the sacred importance of a proper meal.

When he finally pulled it from the oven, it was a thing of simple, honest beauty. The pie, nestled in its dark blue dish, was a perfect, burnished gold. Its crust was high and proud, and the smell that rose from it was a testament to patience and care. It was not a trophy pie, designed to win championships. It was a supper pie, designed to nourish and to comfort. They sat down at the dining table as the evening drew in, the only light coming from the small lamp in the corner, its warm glow illuminating the pie at the centre of the table. Hamish served a generous slice onto each of their plates, the steam rising in a fragrant cloud. For a few minutes, the only sound was the gentle clink of cutlery and the drumming of the rain on the roof, a roof that was now sound and whole.

Hamish savoured the first bite. The pastry was crisp, the filling rich and deep, the flavours perfectly balanced. It was, he had to admit, a very good pie. “The dish bakes evenly,” he observed, more to himself than to Morag. “It holds the heat well.” Morag took a small, critical mouthful. She chewed thoughtfully, her expression unreadable. She swallowed. “It’s adequate,” she said, the highest praise she was capable of offering for a dish made by a former public menace in an appliance gifted by the same. Then she took another, much larger bite. Hamish smiled. He looked at the simple, sturdy dish, at his practical cousin, at the rain-streaked window looking out onto the dark hills of his parish. His faith, he knew, was as solid and dependable as those hills. But he also knew that it wasn’t built on grand theological pronouncements or public victories. It was built on this. On small, quiet acts of grace. On shared labour, on facing the demons of the past, and on the simple, profound, and unwavering truth of a well-made meat pie, served with love, on a cold and rainy night.The quiet that settled over the manse in the following months was deep and restorative. It was the quiet of a house that had been through a great storm and was now enjoying the calm that followed, its foundations tested and found true. The seasons turned, the last of the autumn gold was scoured from the hills by the sharp winds of winter, and the first light dustings of snow began to cap the majestic peak of Ben Christie. Hamish found himself slipping back into the familiar, gentle rhythms of his parish life with a sense of profound relief. The memory of the Golden Crust championship and the subsequent Pie-Raiser began to feel like a strange, vivid dream, its colours fading into the soft, grey palette of everyday existence. The cheque from Angus had been quietly deposited, the roofer paid, and the matter closed with a solemn, satisfied nod from Mr. Abernathy. The dark blue earthenware dish was now a part of the kitchen’s landscape, a silent testament to a chapter Hamish considered well and truly finished.

He was in his study, a week before Christmas, wrestling with his sermon. He was trying to draw a line between the journey of the Magi and the journey of the soul towards grace, but the metaphor felt tired and overwrought. Outside, a gentle snow was falling, muffling the world in a blanket of white. It was a perfect afternoon for quiet contemplation, for old books and a fresh pot of tea. The peace was shattered by the sound of a car engine, an expensive, throaty purr utterly alien to the usual chug of tractors and battered hatchbacks that populated Glenfinnan. Hamish glanced out of the window. A sleek, black Jaguar, looking as out of place as a shark in a bathtub, was parked in his driveway. A man in a suit so sharp it looked like it could cut glass emerged, brushing imaginary snowflakes from his cashmere overcoat. He strode to the manse door with the confident air of a man who had never been kept waiting.

A moment later, Morag appeared in the study doorway, her expression a thunderous mixture of suspicion and offence. “Hamish, there’s a man at the door. He looks like he’s trying to sell something expensive and unnecessary. A politician, I think. I’ve told him you’re busy contemplating the eternal, but he’s very persistent.” The man appeared behind her, peering over her shoulder with a brilliant, white smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Reverend Macleod! A pleasure. Bartholomew Higgins, but please, call me Barty. I’m from the Golden Crust Championship. Don’t worry,” he added, seeing the look of alarm on Hamish’s face, “I’m not here to check on your stomach’s elasticity.” He breezed into the room, extending a perfectly manicured hand, his aftershave a subtle but expensive cloud that did battle with the room’s scent of lemon polish.

Hamish, taken aback, shook the man’s hand reluctantly. “Mr. Higgins. This is a surprise. I had thought my association with your… event… was concluded.” Barty laughed, a smooth, practiced sound. “Reverend, your association has only just begun! You’re a sensation! The Vicar Who Baked a Miracle! The Pie-ous Piper! Our marketing department has been having a field day. You changed the game, Hamish—may I call you Hamish? You introduced a narrative. A story. It turns out people are more interested in a good man saving his church with a family recipe than they are in watching a docker unhinge his jaw.” He perched on the edge of Hamish’s desk, a picture of slick, metropolitan confidence. “The long and short of it is, the brand is evolving. We’re pivoting. The gluttony is still there, of course—it’s our bread and butter, no pun intended—but we want to add a touch of class. A touch of… you.”

Hamish stared at him, bewildered. “A touch of me? Mr. Higgins, I am a parish priest in the highlands. My ‘touch’ involves jumble sales and slightly off-key hymns. I’m not sure what I can offer your brand.” Barty leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. “We’re introducing a new award. The most prestigious award of the whole championship. Not for the most pies eaten, but for the *best* pie eaten. A single, perfect pie, judged on taste, technique, and tradition. The ‘Golden Slice’ award, we’re calling it. And we want you, Reverend, to be our head judge.” Hamish felt the air leave his lungs. Judge? Him? Go back to that arena of noise and competitive digestion? “Absolutely not,” he said, the words coming out more forcefully than he’d intended. “I’m flattered, but my competing days, and indeed my spectating days, are over. I have a parish to run.”

“A fool’s errand, Hamish,” Morag muttered from the doorway, validating his refusal. Barty’s smile didn’t falter. He had expected this. “Hear me out,” he said smoothly. “This is your chance to champion everything you believe in. To put the craft of baking on the main stage. To honour your father’s legacy in a way that’s about quality, not quantity. Think of it. A national platform to preach the gospel of the good pie.” He was good, Hamish had to give him that. He knew exactly which buttons to press. The idea was tempting, a seed of vanity and mission sprouting in the fertile ground of his pride. But the memory of the sheer, vulgar spectacle of the contest was too strong. “The answer is still no, Mr. Higgins. I cannot in good conscience endorse an event that celebrates gluttony.”

Barty sighed, a theatrical display of disappointment. “A pity,” he said, rising from the desk. “I thought the prize might interest you. The winner of the Golden Slice doesn’t just get a trophy. They get a twenty-thousand-pound development grant and a one-year contract to supply their pies to the Henderson’s Food Hall chain. The most exclusive grocer in Scotland. It’s a life-changing opportunity for a small baker. A chance to turn a passion into a proper, sustainable business.” He paused, letting the scale of the prize sink in. He walked towards the door, then stopped, turning back as if struck by a sudden afterthought. “It’s a shame, really. I was so looking forward to seeing the story come full circle. We’ve already been scouting potential entrants for the inaugural award. We look for bakers with a story, with a commitment to traditional methods.” He fixed Hamish with a knowing look. “There’s a little place in Falkirk that’s been creating a huge amount of buzz. Run by an ex-strongman, of all things. A real redemption story. It’s called ‘The Honest Pie’.”

The name landed in the quiet study with the force of a physical blow. Hamish stared at Barty, his carefully constructed refusal crumbling into dust. Angus. They wanted to give Angus a shot at a new life, a proper future, built on the foundations Hamish himself had helped lay. And they were asking Hamish to be the one to judge him, to be the arbiter of his former nemesis’s fate. It was a dilemma of biblical proportions, a complex, terrifying knot of duty, pride, and personal history. It was a test of his faith more profound than any leaking roof or schoolyard bully. He looked past Barty to the window, at the snow falling softly on the quiet, unchanging hills, and felt the solid ground of his simple life shifting beneath his feet. The game, it seemed, was far from over.The name, ‘The Honest Pie’, hung in the air of the quiet study, a bomb dropped with devastating, smiling precision. Hamish felt a sudden, dizzying sense of vertigo, as if the solid, dependable floor of the manse had tilted on its axis. The peaceful, ordered world he had so carefully rebuilt dissolved around him, replaced by the ghost of the roaring crowd, the blinding lights, and the sickly-sweet smell of victory. Barty Higgins watched him, his sharp eyes missing nothing, seeing the flicker of indecision, the sudden, raw conflict that had erupted behind the vicar’s gentle façade. He knew, with the certainty of a master salesman who has just found his customer’s deepest desire, that the hook was set.

With a final, dazzling smile, Barty pushed himself off the desk, the transaction complete in his mind. He placed a thick, glossy business card on a pile of theological papers. “Think about it, Reverend,” he said, his voice once again a smooth purr. “The final is in Glasgow this year. In February. A grand affair at the old Fruitmarket. You have my number. Let me know when you’ve made the inevitable decision.” He gave a slick, confident nod to Morag, who glared at him as if he were a particularly bold rat that had just scampered across her kitchen floor, and then he was gone. The front door closed with a soft click, and the only evidence he had ever been there was the alien scent of his expensive aftershave and the heavy, impossible choice he had left behind.

“A snake,” Morag pronounced, the moment the sound of the Jaguar’s engine faded down the drive. She marched into the study, picking up the business card with her fingertips as if it were contaminated. “A silver-tongued serpent come to tempt you out of your nice, quiet garden. Can’t you see what he’s doing, Hamish? They don’t care about you. They don’t care about Angus MacLeod. They care about a story. They’ve found their new gimmick, and you’re it. The Holy Judge. They’ll parade you around, use your good name to sell their spectacle, and then when they’re done with you, they’ll toss you aside like last week’s meat trimmings.” She dropped the card into the wastepaper basket with a flick of her wrist.

Hamish barely registered her words. He had sunk into his worn leather armchair, his head in his hands, the world a confusing, spinning blur. Morag was right, of course. On a rational level, he knew everything she said was true. Barty Higgins was a manipulator, a purveyor of spectacle. To go back would be to willingly walk into the lion’s den, to lend his credibility to an enterprise he fundamentally disapproved of. His quiet life, his peace, the hard-won serenity of his parish—all would be disrupted, thrown into the garish spotlight once more. The desire to simply write to Mr. Higgins with a firm, final, and unequivocal ‘no’ was a powerful, physical ache. It was the sensible, sane, and self-preserving thing to do.

But beneath the logic, a deeper, more troubling current was pulling at him. He thought of Angus, not the swaggering Mauler, but the broken man who had stood in this very room, begging for a recipe as if it were salvation. He thought of the butcher’s huge, clumsy hands learning the delicate art of the fold, the raw determination on his face as he wrestled with a sack of potatoes, the profound, silent awe as he pulled his first, perfect pie from the oven. Hamish had been the architect of that transformation, a catalyst for that redemption. Could he now, in the final act, abandon his creation to the mercy of strangers? Could he trust that a panel of cynical, city-based judges would understand what they were tasting? That they would see the story in the crust, the penance in the gravy, the humility in the simple, honest crimp of the pastry? He was terrified that they would not. He was terrified that Angus, having come so far, would be dismissed with a slick sneer, his life’s work judged and found wanting by men who understood branding far better than they understood baking.

He rose from his chair and began to pace the confines of the study, a caged animal once more. His journey with Angus had been a private ministry, a quiet transaction of grace between two men. To re-enter the public sphere, to put on a suit and sit on a throne of judgment, felt like a betrayal of that privacy. Yet, to refuse felt like a greater betrayal still—an abdication of responsibility, a failure of stewardship. He stopped his pacing and stood before the mantelpiece. The golden pie dish, a relic of his own complicated victory, seemed to mock him with its empty, shining surface. It represented a contest he had won for himself. This was different. This was not about him at all. His gaze drifted through the doorway, to the kitchen dresser, where the dark blue earthenware dish sat, solid and unassuming. It was a dish for giving, not for taking.

In that moment, the path became agonizingly clear. He could not stand aside. He had to see it through. He had started this story, and he had a moral obligation to be there for its conclusion, whatever that might be. It was not a choice born of pride or a desire to return to the limelight, but one born of a heavy, inescapable sense of duty. His role had changed. He was no longer the competitor or the teacher. He was now being called to be the witness. He opened the study door and found Morag in the hallway, pretending to dust a picture frame, her posture rigid with a mixture of anger and concern. Their eyes met, and she saw the decision in his face before he said a word. The fight went out of her, replaced by a weary, profound resignation.

“I have to do it, Morag,” he said, his voice quiet but firm. “I have to be there.” She sighed, a long, slow exhalation of breath that seemed to carry all her frustrations with it. She put down her duster and looked at him, her gaze softening from one of a warrior to one of a weary guardian. “I know,” she said. “I knew you would, you daft, good-hearted fool.” She straightened his collar, a familiar, grounding gesture. “Right then. The final is in February, he said? We’ll need to book a hotel. Somewhere quiet, away from all the fuss. And I’m coming with you.” Hamish looked at her, his heart swelling with gratitude. “Morag, you don’t have to—” “Don’t be ridiculous, Hamish,” she cut him off, her voice once again brisk and business-like. “Someone has to be there to make sure your head doesn’t get turned by all that flattery and fancy catering. And,” she added, a faint, almost imperceptible glint of battle in her eye, “I want to see the look on that Barty Higgins’s face when he realises he’s not just getting a pliable vicar. He’s getting a vicar with a chaperone.”The journey to Glasgow was a quiet, tense affair. The landscape unfurling outside the car window was a familiar one, but Hamish saw it through a new and deeply uncomfortable lens. He was no longer a competitor, fired by righteous anger and a desperate need to prove himself. Nor was he a pilgrim on a mission of mercy. He was a judge, an arbiter, a role that felt as ill-fitting and unnatural as a suit of armour. He was travelling towards a conclusion he had no control over, armed only with a fork and a conscience that was already feeling tenderised. He wore his best clerical suit, the tweed freshly pressed by Morag, but he felt like an imposter, a simple country vicar masquerading as a connoisseur. He was going to sit in judgement on another man’s dream, a dream he himself had helped to build, and the hypocrisy of it sat like a cold, undigested stone in his gut.

Morag drove with a grim, tight-lipped focus, her hands gripping the steering wheel as if she were personally navigating them through hostile territory. Her silence was a fortress, radiating disapproval of the entire enterprise. She had packed a flask of tea and a Tupperware box of her own shortbread, a clear and defiant statement against the fancy catering and metropolitan nonsense she anticipated. She was not a spectator; she was a bodyguard, a one-woman Praetorian Guard tasked with protecting her fool of a cousin from the seductive, corrupting influence of television producers and men who called themselves ‘Barty’. The hotel she had booked was a small, fiercely independent establishment on a quiet side street, far from the trendy hubbub of the city centre, chosen for its distinct lack of a cocktail bar and its promise of a “full, no-nonsense Scottish breakfast.”

The venue for the final, the old Fruitmarket, was a vast, cavernous space of cast iron, glass, and exposed brick. It had been scrubbed clean of its history as a place of honest commerce and repurposed as a cathedral of modern cool. The air hummed with a manic, media-driven energy. Banks of television lights, hot and blinding, turned the space into a theatrical stage. Cables snaked across the floor like tripwires, and camera crews prowled the perimeter with a predatory grace. Sound engineers spoke into headsets, their faces etched with urgent concentration. It was a world away from the slightly fusty, good-natured chaos of the Edinburgh assembly hall. This was slicker, louder, and infinitely more cynical. Hamish, clutching his official ‘Judge’ lanyard, felt the familiar, cold pang of being a small, tweed-clad fish in a very large, very fashionable pond.

Barty Higgins materialised out of the throng, his suit immaculate, his smile a weapon of mass reassurance. “Hamish! Morag! Wonderful! You made it!” he boomed, clapping Hamish on the shoulder with a bonhomie that felt entirely manufactured. “Welcome to the show! It’s a bit of a circus, I know, but it’s our circus. Come, let me introduce you to your fellow arbiters of taste.” He led them towards a raised dais where a long, linen-draped table was set for three. At one end sat a woman of impossible glamour. She was tall and slender, with a severe black haircut and scarlet lipstick, her entire being radiating an aura of intimidating chic. “Hamish, this is Sabine Dubois,” Barty announced. “You’ll know her from her show, ‘Pudding Politics’, and her three Michelin stars.” Sabine offered Hamish a limp, cool hand and a smile that was more of a polite baring of teeth. “A vicar,” she said, her voice a low, purring drawl with a faint French accent. “How… quaint. I trust your palate extends beyond the communion wafer, Reverend?”

Before Hamish could formulate a reply, Barty gestured to the man at the other end of the table. He was the complete antithesis of Sabine. He was a portly, rumpled figure in a crumpled tweed jacket that had seen better decades, his florid face framed by a mane of untidy white hair. He looked up from the glass of red wine he was nursing, his eyes, small and sharp, giving Hamish a swift, dismissive appraisal. “And this is the legendary Alistair Finch,” Barty said with a flourish. “For forty years the most feared, and respected, food critic at The Caledonian. Alistair, this is our story, Reverend Hamish Macleod.” Finch grunted, not bothering to extend a hand. “Another one,” he sighed into his wine glass. “Used to be you had to know how to cook. Now all you need is a sob story and a good publicist.”

Hamish felt his face flush. He was exactly what Finch had described: the gimmick, the human-interest angle, a piece of narrative casting. He was sitting between a culinary artist who saw food as abstract expressionism and a jaded gourmand who had tasted everything and been impressed by nothing. His own honest, simple love for a good pie felt hopelessly naive, a child’s drawing presented at a modern art exhibition. Barty, oblivious to the frost, clapped his hands together. “Right! The briefing. It’s simple. We have five finalists. You’ll be judging on four criteria, weighted equally. First, Taste – the fundamental pleasure of the thing. Second, Technique – the skill in the bake, the quality of the pastry, the construction. Third, Tradition – does it honour the soul of what a pie is? And finally,” he paused for dramatic effect, “Narrative. The story. Where does it come from? What does it mean? Is it just food, or is it an emotional journey on a plate?”

Sabine nodded enthusiastically. “The narrative is everything, Barty. Food without a story is just… fuel.” Finch let out a cynical snort. “Food with too much story is just dinner theatre. And it’s usually overpriced.” Hamish felt a familiar fire begin to burn in his gut. Narrative. They had turned his deepest belief—that a pie could tell a story of place, of skill, of love—into a marketing buzzword, a fourth column on a scorecard. He thought of Angus, of the redemption he had found not in a story, but in the slow, painstaking, humbling work of his own two hands. The idea that his journey would be reduced to a soundbite, an ‘emotional journey on a plate’ to be consumed by these glossy, cynical strangers, filled him with a sudden, protective fury. He looked at his fellow judges, at the artist and the critic, and realised his role here was not to be the quaint country vicar. It was to be the keeper of the truth. He was the only one at the table who understood that the most honest stories are not the ones you tell, but the ones you bake.The competition began not with a klaxon but with a crescendo of dramatic, pulsing music and a sweep of coloured lights. A slick, pre-recorded video package filled the giant screens flanking the stage, introducing the first finalist: a young woman from Leith with a formidable undercut and a philosophy of baking that seemed to involve a lot of foraged ingredients and philosophical statements about sustainability. Her pie, when it was brought out on a slab of reclaimed slate, was a small, perfectly square creation with a lattice top so intricate it looked more like a piece of architecture than a meal. A production assistant, with the hushed reverence usually reserved for holy relics, placed a slice before each judge. Hamish looked at the creation on his plate. It was beautiful, sterile, and seemed to have been constructed with tweezers.

The judging process was a brutal lesson in subjectivity. Sabine tasted the Leith pie, her eyes closed, and declared it a "fascinating dialogue between the earthiness of the chanterelle and the astringent impertinence of the wild garlic." She praised its "post-modern deconstruction of the traditional pie form" but criticised the pastry for being "insufficiently ironic." Alistair Finch, after a cursory prod and a small bite, dismissed it out of hand. “Tastes of wet leaves and smugness,” he grumbled, pushing the plate away. “The pastry is brittle, not flaky. A fundamental error. Next.” Hamish, caught between the two extremes, simply noted that for all its cleverness, it failed the first and most important test of a pie: it did not make you want to eat a second bite.

The next few finalists blurred into a similar pattern of high concept and cynical critique. There was a game pie from a titled landowner in Perthshire that Finch praised for its traditional, bloody-minded honesty but Sabine dismissed as “aggressively nostalgic.” There was a curried fish pie from a fusion chef in Glasgow that Sabine adored for its “bravery and cultural fluidity,” while Finch muttered darkly about “culinary colonialism” and complained it had made his wine taste of cumin. Through it all, Hamish sat in a state of growing despair. They weren’t judging food. They were judging ideologies. They were engaged in a performance, each playing their assigned role: the avant-garde artist, the jaded traditionalist, and him, the folksy amateur, whose scorecard notes about ‘a pleasing texture’ and ‘a well-seasoned filling’ felt hopelessly inadequate.

Then, it was time. Barty Higgins’s voice boomed through the speakers, dripping with manufactured emotion. “And finally, folks, a story that truly embodies the spirit of the Golden Slice. A man who went from strongman to stooge, from ‘The Mauler’ to rock bottom. He lost it all, but in a small village in the highlands, he found a teacher, he found a purpose, and he found The Honest Pie!” The screens flickered to life with a montage that made Hamish’s stomach clench. There were dramatic, black-and-white shots of Angus lifting huge stones, contrasted with a staged photo of him looking forlornly at a ‘For Sale’ sign. Then, the music swelled as footage—presumably taken by a covert camera crew—showed Hamish, looking faintly baffled, guiding Angus’s hands on a piece of dough. It was a cheap, manipulative narrative, a gross simplification of the slow, painful, and private process of redemption. It made Hamish feel sick. He glanced into the audience and saw Morag, her face a mask of pure, unadulterated fury. She looked like she was ready to march on stage and brain Barty Higgins with her Tupperware box.

The pie was brought out. It was a stark and beautiful rebuke to all the slickness that had preceded it. It was round, generous, and unapologetically rustic. It sat in a simple, dark blue earthenware dish that Hamish recognised with a jolt that went straight to his heart. The pastry was a deep, honest gold, not uniformly coloured, but burnished darker in places, a testament to the real, unpredictable heat of an oven rather than the controlled environment of a food stylist’s studio. The edge was sealed not with an intricate lattice or a fancy flourish, but with the deep, firm, practical press of a fork. It was a pie built to be eaten, not to be photographed. Sabine Dubois looked at it with an expression of faint disgust, as if a muddy farm animal had just wandered onto her pristine white carpet. “My God,” she murmured, “it’s so… literal.”

A slice was placed before each of them. It didn’t sit primly on the plate; it leaned slightly, its rich, dark filling threatening to spill out, a promise of generosity, not a display of rigid control. Hamish picked up his fork. The faint scent of thyme and slow-cooked mutton rose to meet him, a smell he knew as well as the scent of his own church’s dusty hymn books. He took a bite. The taste was a thunderclap of memory and emotion. It was the taste of his father’s legacy, of his own kitchen, but it was imbued with something more, a new depth, a new character. It was Angus. He could taste the patient hours of labour, the humility it had taken to learn, the quiet pride of a man who had discovered not just a recipe, but a better version of himself. It was, without question, the best pie he had ever eaten in his life.

He looked up, his heart pounding, to see his fellow judges’ reactions. Sabine was nibbling at a tiny piece of crust with the air of someone performing a distasteful duty. She dabbed her scarlet lips with a napkin. “The pastry is… sturdy,” she said, her voice dripping with disdain. “One could perhaps build a retaining wall with it. And the filling… it is a monologue, not a conversation. There is no complexity, no surprise. It is merely… meat.” Her dismissal was so total, so contemptuous, that Hamish felt a surge of hot, protective anger. He opened his mouth to argue, to defend it, but his protest was cut short by the sound of Alistair Finch.

The old critic had been silently, methodically, eating his entire slice. He hadn’t just tasted it; he had devoured it. He had cleaned his plate, mopping up the last of the gravy with a piece of pastry. He now sat back, pushing the plate away, and took a long, slow sip of his wine. He dabbed his lips, not with the delicacy of Sabine, but with the brisk finality of a man who has just enjoyed his lunch. The cameras zoomed in. Barty’s voiceover held its breath. Finch looked down the table, first at Sabine’s dismissive sneer, then at Hamish’s anxious, pleading face. He cleared his throat. “The narrative,” he began, his voice a low, gravelly rumble that cut through the silence of the vast hall, “is sentimental claptrap.” Hamish’s heart plummeted. It was over. “The redemption story is irrelevant. I couldn’t care less if this pie was baked by a saint or a sinner.” He paused, leaning forward and fixing the camera with a stare of utter seriousness. “All I care about is what is on the plate. And what is on this plate,” he said, his voice dropping an octave, “is, without a shadow of a doubt, a pie.”The word seemed to hang in the air, a plain, powerful stone dropped into a pool of shimmering nonsense. It was a word so fundamental, so obvious, that it had been entirely forgotten by everyone else. Alistair Finch leaned back, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on his lips. He was enjoying himself for the first time all day. “Let me be clear,” he continued, his voice resonating with the authority of a man who has written half a million words on the subject of food and meant every one of them. “The other contestants have brought us concepts. They have brought us theories. They have brought us edible manifestos about sustainability and irony and cultural appropriation. They have brought us everything except the one thing we are ostensibly here to judge.” He pointed a thick, wine-stained finger at the remains of Angus’s slice on his plate. “This is not a concept. This is supper. The pastry isn’t having a dialogue with my palate; it is performing its sacred, sworn duty, which is to provide a structurally sound, flavourful, and buttery vessel for the gravy. And the gravy is not a monologue; it is a rich, profound, and deeply satisfying statement of fact about what happens when good mutton is cooked slowly, with care, by someone who respects the animal it came from. This, Madame Dubois, is not quaint. It is the very heart of the matter.”

Sabine Dubois looked as though Finch had just accused her of using margarine. A flush of angry colour rose on her sharp cheekbones. “That is a pathetically regressive, anti-intellectual argument,” she retorted, her voice losing its purring quality and gaining a sharp, brittle edge. “Food must evolve. Art must evolve. To simply replicate the past, to celebrate this kind of… peasant stodge… is not tradition, it is culinary taxidermy. It is a failure of imagination.” Finch merely shrugged, took another sip of his wine, and said, “I’d rather have a perfectly stuffed pheasant than an imaginative disaster. It is a failure of yours, Madame, to recognise that imagination’s highest calling is not to invent, but to perfect.” The two glared at each other down the length of the table, an immovable object meeting an irresistible force, the future and the past of food locked in a battle to the death over a slice of mutton pie.

The cameras all swivelled to face Hamish. The pulsing music quieted to a low, expectant thrum. He was the tie-breaker. The fulcrum on which a man’s future was balanced. He felt a thousand eyes on him. He took a deep breath, the scent of thyme and victory still lingering in his senses. “Mr. Finch speaks of tradition, and Madame Dubois of imagination,” he began, his voice calm and steady, the familiar cadence of the pulpit serving him well. “They are both, of course, correct. A good pie needs both. It needs the imagination to see the potential in simple ingredients, and the respect for tradition to know how to unlock it.” He paused, looking directly into the main camera, speaking not just to the audience in the hall but to the vast, unseen congregation beyond. “We were asked to judge on narrative,” he said, a note of steel entering his voice. “The video we saw told one story. A simple, marketable story. But it is not the real one. The real story is the one I can taste on my plate. I don’t taste a redemption arc, Mr. Higgins. I taste patience. I taste the humility it takes to learn something new when you are no longer young. I taste the quiet pride of a man who has discovered that his hands are good for more than just breaking things. That is a profound story. It is the story of grace. And you can’t put that in a video package. But you can, it seems, bake it in a pie.”

He laid his fork down with a quiet finality. It was time for the scores. Barty Higgins, his face a mask of professional delight at the unscripted drama, prompted them. “Judges, your scores, please.” Alistair Finch went first. He held up his scoring paddle. “For Taste, a ten. For Technique, a nine – the crimping is a little agricultural, but it serves its purpose. For Tradition, a ten. For Narrative,” he gave a theatrical sigh, “a five. I’m judging the pie, not the libretto.” A gasp went through the crowd. Sabine was next. Her face was granite. “For Taste, a three. It is… proficient. For Technique, a six. It is merely… functional. For Tradition, a four. It is a relic. For Narrative, a two. It is a fairytale for simpletons.” A wave of boos and jeers rolled from the audience, which she ignored with an imperious tilt of her head. The scores were tallied. It was close. It all came down to Hamish.

He picked up his scoring paddle, his hand surprisingly steady. He thought of the journey, of the peeling and the chopping, of the man who had arrived in despair and was now waiting in the wings, his future held in these small white numbers. He looked at the pie on his plate, a beacon of honesty in a sea of artifice. “For Technique,” he said, his voice ringing with conviction, “a nine. For Tradition, a ten. For Narrative—the *real* narrative—a ten.” He paused, savouring the final, most important judgement. “And for Taste,” he declared, “it is a perfect, unqualified ten.” He held up his paddle. The numbers flashed up on the big screen. The silence was absolute for a heartbeat, and then the hall exploded. The final tally was not even close. Angus MacLeod, by a landslide, had won the first-ever Golden Slice award.

The roar of the crowd was a physical wave of sound. Confetti cannons erupted, showering the stage in a blizzard of shimmering gold. Barty Higgins was screaming into his microphone, his voice hoarse with triumph. Hamish sat back in his chair, the tension draining out of him, leaving a profound and wonderful emptiness. He had done it. He had borne witness. He looked offstage and saw him. Angus was standing there, frozen, his face utterly blank with shock as producers tried to push him towards the stage. His eyes found Hamish’s across the glittering, chaotic space, and his expression was one of pure, uncomprehending disbelief. Then Hamish’s gaze shifted to the audience, to the second row, where a small, fierce woman in a tweed coat was standing. Morag was not clapping. She was not cheering. She was simply watching, and on her face, for the first time Hamish could ever remember seeing it, was a slow, beautiful, tear-tracked smile. His job was done. The baker had his victory. The story was finally, blessedly, complete.The chaos that followed the announcement was a glittering, manic storm. Hamish remained seated on the dais, an island of calm in a sea of manufactured jubilation. He watched, with a strange sense of detachment, as Barty Higgins practically dragged a shell-shocked Angus onto the main stage. The confetti swirled, the music pulsed, and the lights swept across the ecstatic crowd. It was a perfect television moment, a pre-packaged triumph. But Hamish knew the real victory had already happened, quietly, in a kitchen filled with the smell of onions and the patient rasp of a vegetable peeler. He saw Sabine Dubois rise, her face a mask of elegant fury, and sweep from the stage without a backward glance, her artistic sensibilities mortally wounded. Alistair Finch, with a small, satisfied sigh, drained his wine glass, gave a single, almost imperceptible nod in Hamish’s direction, and then ambled off in search of a quieter bar, his part in the drama concluded.

On stage, Angus looked like a bear that had been unexpectedly woken from hibernation and dressed in a party hat. He stared blankly at the oversized novelty cheque for twenty thousand pounds that Barty was trying to press into his hands. “Angus! Tell us how it feels!” Barty bellowed into a microphone, shoving it towards Angus’s face. “The emotion! The journey! What does this moment mean to you?” Angus blinked into the blinding lights, utterly overwhelmed. He looked not at the cheque, nor at the adoring crowd, but across the stage, his gaze locking with Hamish’s. He opened his mouth, and for a heart-stopping second, Hamish was terrified he might talk about the stolen pie, about his mother, about all the private, painful things that had brought him here. But Angus simply took a deep, shuddering breath and spoke two words into the microphone, his voice a low, humbled rumble. “It’s heavy,” he said, looking at the golden trophy—a magnificent, stylized rolling pin—that had been thrust upon him. Barty’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second before he recovered, laughing heartily and clapping Angus on the back as if he had just delivered a profound and witty aphorism.

That was Hamish’s cue to leave. He had no desire to be a part of the post-match analysis. He slipped away from the judges' table just as the first wave of journalists began to surge towards the stage. He was intercepted halfway to the exit by Morag. Her face was still flushed, and the tracks of her tears were visible on her powdered cheeks, but her expression was once again one of grim, military competence. “This way,” she commanded, taking his arm in a surprisingly strong grip. “Through the service exit. I’ve already scouted a route. We’re not getting cornered by some young pup with a microphone asking you for your thoughts on pastry integrity.” She navigated him through a maze of backstage corridors with the unerring instinct of a seasoned escape artist, her presence a formidable shield against the encroaching media scrum. Just as they reached a door leading out into the cool, quiet night air, a voice called out to them. “Wait.”

It was Angus. He had somehow managed to detach himself from the circus, and now he stood in the stark, fluorescent light of the corridor, still clutching the golden rolling pin as if he wasn't quite sure what it was. He was alone. Hamish and Morag stopped. The three of them stood there for a moment in an awkward, charged silence, a million unspoken things hanging in the air between them. Hamish spoke first. “Well done, Angus,” he said, his voice warm and sincere. “It was a magnificent pie.” Angus looked down at the trophy in his hands, a flicker of something—pride, wonder, confusion—in his eyes. “I just baked it the way you taught me,” he said simply. “I just… I didn’t want to let it down.” He looked from Hamish to Morag, his expression hesitant. “I saw you,” he said to her. “In the crowd.”

Morag drew herself up, her emotional display in the audience clearly a source of deep embarrassment to her now. She inspected Angus from head to toe, her gaze lingering on the golden trophy. “You didn’t burn the bottom,” she said, the words coming out clipped and formal. It was an assessment, not a compliment. “And you’ve got confetti in your hair. You look ridiculous.” Angus actually flinched slightly. But then Morag’s expression softened, the hard lines around her mouth easing for just a second. “Still,” she added, her voice dropping almost to a whisper, “it was a decent bit of baking. For a beginner.” She reached out, plucked a stray piece of golden confetti from Angus’s hair, and then, without another word, turned and pushed open the exit door, leaving the two men alone. Angus stared after her, a look of stunned disbelief on his face. He knew, as did Hamish, that he had just received the highest honour Morag was capable of bestowing. The golden rolling pin in his hands suddenly seemed secondary.

The drive back to Glenfinnan, through the dark and sleeping heart of Scotland, was the quietest yet. The car was filled not with anxiety or tension, but with a deep and bone-weary peace. The Morris Minor hummed along, its familiar engine a gentle, comforting sound. For the first hour, neither of them spoke. Hamish leaned his head against the cool glass of the window, watching the occasional headlights of other cars flash by like shooting stars, and felt the knot of responsibility that had been tied in his stomach for months finally, blessedly, unravel. He had done his duty. He had borne witness. He had judged, and in doing so, had found a strange kind of absolution for himself. He had come full circle, not just with Angus, but with the part of himself that was his father’s son. The competitive fire had been banked, replaced by the warm, steady glow of shared accomplishment.

It was Morag who finally broke the silence as they crossed the border from the lowlands back into the familiar, rugged silhouette of the highlands. “That Alistair Finch,” she said, her eyes fixed on the winding road ahead. “He was a pompous old windbag. But he was right about the pie.” Hamish smiled in the darkness. “He was,” he agreed. “He saw the truth of it.” “Hmph,” Morag grunted. “It doesn’t take a genius to see the truth of a good pie. You just need a working tongue and a bit of sense. Unlike that French woman. ‘Insufficiently ironic’,” she scoffed, the memory of the phrase a fresh insult. “I’d like to see her try and survive a winter in Glenfinnan on a diet of irony.” Hamish chuckled, a soft, warm sound. “I think you would have made a much better judge than she did, Morag.” “Of course I would have,” she said, as if it were the most obvious fact in the world. “I wouldn’t have wasted time with all that narrative nonsense. I’d have just tasted the pies and told them which one was best. It’s not complicated.” And in that simple, brutally practical statement, Hamish heard the echo of Alistair Finch, and the echo of his own heart. The truth of a pie wasn’t complicated at all.

Spring came to the glens, not with a sudden burst, but with a slow, gentle greening of the hillsides and the return of the birdsong to the crisp morning air. The drama of the Golden Slice faded, becoming just another story folded into the rich, layered history of the parish. Hamish’s life returned to its comforting, pastoral rhythm, and he found that his sermons were subtly changed. He spoke more often of simple things: of the patience of the baker waiting for the dough to rise, of the quiet miracle of a seed sprouting in dark earth, of the grace to be found in a shared meal. His congregation listened, and they understood. He was their vicar, and he was the pie-man, and the two were, at last, one and the same. One Tuesday morning, a small, square parcel arrived in the post. It was heavy, and addressed simply to ‘The Manse, Glenfinnan’. Hamish opened it in the kitchen, with Morag looking on with her usual curiosity. Inside, nestled in a bed of wood shavings, was a pie. It sat in a simple foil dish, its crust a beautiful, even gold, its edge crimped with a familiar, fork-pressed pattern. Tucked under the rim was a small, folded note. Hamish opened it. It read: ‘New recipe. Steak and ale. Thought you should try it. Angus.’

That evening, as a soft spring rain pattered against the windows, Hamish and Morag sat at the kitchen table. Hamish cut into the pie, the knife breaking the crust with a satisfying crackle. He served a slice for each of them. He took a bite. The pastry was perfect, the steak was tender, and the gravy was rich with the dark, malty tang of good ale. It was a new story, a new chapter. It was the taste of a future. He looked across the table at his cousin, who was chewing her first mouthful with a look of intense, critical concentration. She swallowed, dabbed her lips with her napkin, and delivered her final, definitive judgment on the whole affair. “It’s a definite improvement,” she said. “He’s finally learned not to overwork the pastry.” Hamish smiled, a smile of pure, unadulterated contentment. In the quiet of his own heart, he knew that God, in His infinite wisdom, had a particular fondness not just for a well-made meat pie, but for the winding, improbable, and grace-filled journeys that brought them to the table.The summer that followed was long and golden, a season of quiet grace that settled over Glenfinnan like a warm blanket. The bracken on the hills turned a deep, luxuriant green, and the waters of the loch were a constant, shimmering mirror of the endless blue sky. For the first time in over a year, Hamish felt a profound sense of peace, a feeling that everything was, at last, in its proper place. The grand dramas of the past year—the competitions, the leaky roof, the redemption of Angus MacLeod—had receded, their sharp edges softened by time, becoming another set of stories to be woven into the fabric of the parish. The dark blue earthenware dish from Angus had become a regular feature of their weekly meals, a sturdy, dependable vessel that produced pies of comforting regularity, each one a quiet affirmation of the journey that had brought it to their table.

Hamish’s life had returned to its familiar, gentle rhythm. He found a deep and simple pleasure in the unchanging cycles of his ministry: the Sunday services, the pastoral visits, the endless but satisfying struggle to keep the church hall’s boiler from making alarming clanking noises. His brief notoriety had all but vanished, and he was grateful for it. He was no longer the ‘Pie-Man’, a local curiosity, but simply the vicar once more, a man whose counsel was sought on matters of faith and, occasionally, on the persistent problem of soggy bottoms in a fruit tart. He found he enjoyed this dual role, this small, strange ministry of the spirit and the stomach. He had finally integrated the baker’s son and the man of God, and the resulting whole felt more complete, more honest, than either part had been on its own.

The call came on a drowsy Tuesday afternoon in late August. Hamish was in his study, half-dozing over a book on early Celtic saints, the drone of a bumblebee against the windowpane a soothing, hypnotic sound. The telephone’s shrill ring was a violent intrusion, a tearing of the peaceful fabric of the afternoon. He answered it with a slight sense of irritation, expecting a query about the upcoming harvest festival. The voice on the other end was hesitant, strained, and almost unrecognisable. It was Angus. He sounded not like the triumphant champion of Glasgow, nor the humble apprentice of the manse kitchen, but like the broken man who had first appeared at his door all those months ago.

“Vicar? Hamish? It’s Angus,” he began, his voice a low, gravelly rasp of exhaustion. “I’m sorry to bother you. I know you’ve got your own concerns. But I… I don’t know who else to call.” The background was filled with a cacophony of noise—the metallic clang of machinery, the hum of industrial fans, the shouting of unfamiliar voices. It did not sound like the quiet, clean haven of ‘The Honest Pie’. “Angus? What’s wrong? Where are you?” Hamish asked, sitting bolt upright in his chair, the sleepy peace of the afternoon utterly shattered. “I’m at the new unit,” Angus said, his voice laced with a despair so profound it was almost a physical thing. “The Henderson’s contract… it’s… I thought it was the answer to everything. But it’s a monster, Hamish. It’s eating me alive.”

He poured out his story in a torrent of misery and confusion. The initial orders had been manageable. But then Henderson’s Food Hall, smelling a marketing success, had tripled them. They wanted his pies in every one of their twenty stores across the country. They had ‘helped’ him lease a new, vast industrial unit on the outskirts of Falkirk. They had sent in their own people. ‘Efficiency consultants’ who timed his every move with a stopwatch and suggested replacing his slow-braised mutton with pre-processed, vacuum-packed cubes to save time. ‘Brand managers’ who designed new packaging with slick graphics and focus-group-tested taglines, none of which included the word ‘Honest’. They were pushing him to automate, to cut corners, to replace the butter in his father’s pastry recipe with a cheaper ‘bakery-grade margarine blend’. They were turning his craft into a production line, his pie into a unit, his story into a commodity.

“They want to change the recipe, Hamish,” Angus whispered, his voice cracking with the sheer horror of the sacrilege. “They say the flavour is ‘too specific’, that we need a ‘broader appeal’. They want to make it blander, safer. They’re trying to take the soul out of it.” He sounded like a man being asked to betray his deepest faith. “I tried to say no. I told them the recipe was the whole point. But they just smiled and showed me the contract. They said they were ‘invested’ in my success. They said they were just ‘streamlining the brand narrative’. They use all these words, Hamish, and I don’t understand half of them, but I know what they mean. They mean they want to break it. They want to turn me into a factory. And I can’t… I can’t let that happen. But I don’t know how to fight them.”

Hamish stood gripping the receiver, a cold, furious anger building inside him. This was a new kind of bully, a far more insidious and dangerous foe than the brute who had stolen his lunch in the schoolyard. This was a corporate machine, faceless and smiling, that consumed authenticity and excreted profit. They were not just trying to ruin a business; they were trying to dismantle a man’s hard-won salvation, piece by painstaking piece. “They are vipers, Hamish. A nest of vipers in expensive suits.” The voice was Morag’s. She had entered the study silently, a basket of laundry on her hip, and had stood listening to the one-sided conversation, her sharp mind piecing together the disaster with unerring accuracy. Her face, which had been relaxed just moments before, was now set in the familiar, hard lines of battle.

Hamish covered the mouthpiece. “They’re trying to force him to change the recipe,” he said, his voice tight with outrage. “They want him to use margarine.” Morag’s reaction was visceral. She let out a small, sharp hiss, as if he had just announced a plague of locusts. The sanctity of butter was a theological absolute in Morag’s worldview, its replacement a heresy of the highest order. Her allegiance, which had always been grudgingly with Hamish, now transferred instantly and completely to the cause of Angus MacLeod. “That’s it, then,” she said, her voice a low declaration of war. “This will not stand.” She looked at Hamish, her eyes gleaming with a combative light he had not seen since the Pie-Raiser. “What are you going to tell him?” Hamish uncovered the receiver, his decision made, his path once again horribly, unavoidably clear. “Angus,” he said, his voice ringing with a newfound authority. “Don’t sign anything. Don’t agree to anything. We’re coming.”
