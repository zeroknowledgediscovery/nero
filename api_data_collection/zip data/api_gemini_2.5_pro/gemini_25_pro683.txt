The first lie of the morning was the sun, a pale, watery disc struggling through a scrim of grey cloud that promised a rain it was too tired to deliver. It offered the illusion of light without any of the conviction of warmth. Andrius felt a certain kinship with it. He stood, crook in hand, on the crest of the small hill overlooking the pasture, a patchwork of stubborn green and muddy brown that sloped down toward the lazy, tea-coloured ribbon of the Grand River. His flock, a hundred-odd souls of wool and nervous compliance, moved as a single, breathing entity across the land, their gentle cropping the only sound besides the distant hum of traffic on the 401. A city’s whisper.

It was a strange life, he knew. A shepherd on the frayed edge of Kitchener. His parents, with their neat bungalow in Forest Heights and their sensible talk of pensions and RRSPs, still thought it was a phase, a romantic notion he’d picked up from a book and refused to put down. They didn’t understand the pull of it, the quiet rhythm that had settled deep in his bones. They didn't understand the solace found in the company of simple creatures who wanted only grass, water, and the safety of the flock. They didn’t know it was the only thing that kept the frantic, yearning part of him tethered to the earth. Especially not since Leo. Or maybe, more accurately, because of Leo.

A plume of dust, visible long before the sound of the engine reached him, rose from the gravel track that cut through the neighbouring cornfield. Andrius didn’t need to see the truck, a dented blue Ford Ranger held together by rust and optimism. He knew the sound of its particular cough and sputter the way he knew the individual bleat of a distressed lamb. His heart gave a familiar, traitorous lurch. A small, stupid thing. A hummingbird caught in his ribs. He pressed a hand to his chest, a gesture he hoped looked like he was merely bracing against the damp breeze.

The truck rattled to a stop by the fence line, and Leo swung out of the driver’s side door, all lanky energy and careless grace. He was wearing a paint-splattered t-shirt and jeans with a hole in the knee, his dark hair a mess from the open window. In one hand, he held two steaming paper cups.

“Your noble tribute, O Guardian of the Fleece!” Leo’s voice carried easily on the morning air, a bright, sharp sound against the landscape’s muted tones. He vaulted the split-rail fence rather than using the gate ten feet away, landing with a soft thud on the damp earth.

Andrius let a slow smile spread across his face. It was the only honest thing he’d allowed himself all morning. “You’re late. The sheep were considering unionizing.”

“Let ‘em try. I’ll be the scab who brings the shepherd his coffee.” Leo handed over a cup. It was hot, the warmth seeping instantly through Andrius’s cold fingers. It was from the 24-hour place on the edge of the city, burnt and bitter and perfect. It was their ritual. “Bess giving you any trouble?” Leo asked, nodding toward the grand dame of the flock, an old ewe with a perpetually unimpressed expression.

“She disapproves of my life choices, as always,” Andrius said, taking a sip. The coffee was terrible. He loved it. “She thinks I should have gone into data management.”

Leo laughed, a loud, genuine bark that sent a ripple of alarm through the nearest sheep. They shuffled a few feet away, their bells a nervous tinkle. “She’s not wrong. You’d be great at it. All that… quiet focus.” He nudged Andrius’s shoulder with his own, a casual point of contact that felt like a brand. “Instead you’re out here, living in a Wordsworth poem. A weird, damp, Canadian Wordsworth poem.”

They settled onto their usual spot, a flat-topped boulder worn smooth by time and weather, overlooking the flock. For a few minutes, they just sat, sipping their coffee, cocooned in a comfortable silence that was more intimate than any conversation. This was the axis on which Andrius’s world turned. These quiet moments, stolen between Leo’s life in the city and Andrius’s life with the sheep. Leo worked as a set painter for a small theatre company downtown, his days a riot of colour and frantic deadlines, his nights a blur of cast parties and noisy bars. He brought the chaos of that world with him, its scent of turpentine and cheap beer and ambition, and for a little while, he’d let it settle here in the quiet of the pasture.

Andrius watched him from the corner of his eye. He watched the way Leo’s thumb traced the rim of his paper cup, the way his gaze drifted toward the city, his expression a mixture of affection and restlessness. Andrius had catalogued every detail of him for a decade. The faint scar above his left eyebrow from a childhood fall off a bicycle (Andrius had been there to help him up). The specific way he chewed on his lower lip when he was thinking. The cadence of his speech, the rise and fall of it, a melody Andrius knew by heart. Loving Leo was like breathing. It was an unconscious, necessary, and sometimes painful act.

“So,” Leo said, breaking the quiet. “Big news.”

Andrius’s stomach tightened. Big news, with Leo, could be anything. A new play. A promotion. A sudden decision to move to Toronto. “Yeah?”

“You know that tattoo I’ve been talking about getting forever?”

Andrius relaxed, just a fraction. This was a familiar topic. Leo had been talking about getting a tattoo since they were sixteen. “The dragon fighting a squid on your entire back?”

“Tempting, but no. I’m finally gonna do it. For real this time.” Leo’s eyes were bright with a new kind of excitement. It was different from his usual artistic fervour. It was more personal. More… focused. “I’m getting something small. On my wrist.”

“Oh yeah? What?” Andrius tried to keep his tone light, merely curious. A friend, asking a friend a question. That’s all this was.

Leo hesitated, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. He took a long swallow of his coffee, avoiding Andrius’s gaze. “It’s… it’s a design. A little starling. An intricate one.”

A starling. It was so specific. So unlike the vague, grandiose ideas Leo usually spouted. “A starling? Why a starling?”

“Just something,” Leo said, a little too quickly. He shrugged, but the movement was stiff. “They’re clever birds. And they… they have this iridescence. Looks black, but when the light hits it just right, you see all these other colours. Purple and green. Hidden things.” He finally looked at Andrius, a fragile hope in his expression, as if seeking approval. “It’s for someone.”

The air, which had been still and damp, suddenly felt thin, impossible to draw into his lungs. The distant hum of the highway seemed to roar in his ears. The five words echoed in the space between them. *It’s for someone.* Not "it’s for something." Someone.

“Someone?” The word came out as a croak. Andrius cleared his throat and tried again. “A friend?” He prayed for the answer to be yes. A tribute to a grandparent. An inside joke with a cast member. Anything but the one thing he feared.

Leo’s smile was soft, shy, and utterly devastating. It was a smile Andrius had never seen on him before, and in that instant, he knew it wasn’t meant for him. “More than a friend, I hope. Her name is Clara.”

Clara. The name was a stone dropping into the quiet pool of Andrius’s world. He could already feel the ripples spreading, disrupting everything. He stared at Leo, at the stupid, hopeful, beautiful smile on his face, and felt a chasm open up at his feet. Leo was on one side, beaming, talking about starlings and hidden colours and a girl named Clara. And Andrius was on the other, standing in the mud with his sheep, his bitter coffee, and a love that had suddenly become a burden he wasn’t sure he could carry.

“She loves birds,” Leo was saying, his voice a happy murmur, oblivious to the destruction he was causing. “She’s an artist, too. A jeweler. She makes these incredible little things out of silver and enamel. She’s the one who drew the design for me. We’re… we might get them together.”

We. A second stone, larger than the first. Andrius felt the blood drain from his face. He had to say something. Anything. Something a normal friend would say. *That’s great, man. Tell me about her. When do I get to meet her?* The words were there, lined up on his tongue, but they wouldn't come out. His throat was a knot of unshed grief.

He managed a nod. A single, jerky motion. He took a long, scalding sip of his coffee, hoping the burn would distract from the hollowing ache in his chest. He looked out at his flock. They were calm, unbothered, their world unchanged. A wave of envy, sharp and acidic, washed over him. He wanted to be one of them. He wanted to want nothing more than the feel of the sun, the taste of wet grass, the safety of the herd.

“Hey,” Leo’s voice was suddenly closer, softer. His hand was on Andrius’s arm. The warmth of his palm seeped through the thick wool of Andrius’s sweater, a small fire on his skin. “You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Andrius forced himself to meet Leo’s gaze. He saw only genuine concern there. The utter, heartbreaking cluelessness of his best friend. The man he loved.

“Just tired,” Andrius lied, the second lie of the morning. It was so much easier than the truth. “Long night. A coyote was sniffing around the fence line.” He pulled his arm away gently, pretending to adjust his collar, and stood up. The movement felt wooden, robotic. “I should… I should move them to the lower pasture.”

Leo stood up too, his brow furrowed with worry. “Yeah, okay. You sure you’re alright, An?” He used the old childhood nickname, a name no one else used, and it was like a knife twist.

“I’m fine,” Andrius said, forcing a smile that felt like cracking plaster. “Just… shepherd stuff. You know.” He turned his back to Leo, facing the flock, and raised his crook. He gave a low whistle, a signal the lead sheep knew. The flock began to stir, a river of wool flowing down the hill. He could feel Leo’s eyes on his back, a weight of confusion and concern. Andrius didn’t turn around. He couldn't. If he saw that look on Leo’s face again, the fragile, hopeful look that belonged to a girl named Clara, he was afraid he might shatter completely.

“I’ll, uh, I’ll call you later,” Leo said to his back.

“Yeah,” Andrius called over his shoulder, his voice strained. “You do that.”

He heard Leo’s footsteps receding, the sound of him hopping the fence, the groan of the truck door opening and then slamming shut. The engine coughed to life. Andrius kept his focus on the sheep, on their orderly, predictable movement. He listened as the truck’s tires crunched on the gravel, the sound growing fainter and fainter until it was swallowed once more by the hum of the distant highway.

Only then did he stop. The flock milled around him, waiting for their next command. He leaned heavily on his crook, the smooth, worn wood a familiar comfort in his hand. The pale sun had finally given up, disappearing completely behind the thick grey blanket. A cold drop of rain landed on his cheek. Then another. He didn’t know if it was the sky or himself that was finally breaking. He just stood there, a solitary figure in a field on the edge of the city, as the world he had known began to wash away.The first few drops were cold and fat, splatting against his woolen sweater and the back of his neck with a startling intimacy. He thought for a moment it was a tear, a single, hot betrayal, but it was cold. It was just the rain, finally keeping its promise. He let his head hang, the brim of his worn cap channeling the water away from his eyes. The wood of the crook, polished smooth by his own hand over countless seasons, felt like the only solid thing in a world that had turned to mist. He could still feel the phantom pressure of Leo’s hand on his arm, a warmth that had been replaced by a spreading, invasive chill.

Clara. It wasn’t a name; it was a shard of glass he had swallowed. It sat lodged in his throat, making it impossible to breathe, impossible to think of anything but its sharp edges. He replayed the moment in his mind, a masochistic loop of Leo’s shy, devastating smile. A smile he’d known for twenty years, in all its variations—mischievous, triumphant, drunken, weary—but he had never seen this one. This one was private. It was tender. It belonged to her. The hidden colours of the starling weren't for him to find; he was just part of the black feathers, the mundane surface. He was the friend who brought the shepherd coffee. A character in a weird, damp, Canadian Wordsworth poem. A supporting role.

A wet nose nudged his hand. Pip, his border collie, a black-and-white blur of coiled energy, looked up at him, his intelligent eyes clouded with a canine version of concern. The dog whined softly, a low thrum in his chest, sensing the shift in his master’s posture, the sudden, heavy stillness. The flock, too, had stalled, their downward momentum arrested by his own. They stood dotted across the hillside, heads raised, waiting. They were a responsibility. A constant, living anchor. They needed him. The thought was both a burden and the only lifeline he could grasp. He had to move. He had to keep moving.

Taking a shuddering breath that felt like his first in an age, Andrius straightened his spine. He gave Pip a low, sharp command, and the dog instantly sprang into action, a silent, fluid predator herding not with fear, but with an intense, focused pressure. Andrius began to walk, his long strides eating up the damp ground. Every step was an effort, the mud clinging to his boots with a greedy pull, as if trying to hold him in this one, terrible moment forever. He focused on the mechanics of the task: the dog’s wide, flanking runs; the stubbornness of an old ewe who thought she knew a better way; the collective, flowing response of the flock to the subtle pressures applied to its edges. It was a familiar choreography, a dance he’d perfected over years, and the mindless repetition of it was a small mercy.

But his mind was a traitor. As he walked, the landscape of the pasture became a map of his history with Leo. On that flat-topped boulder, they had dissected bad movies and planned futures that never happened. By that crooked hawthorn tree, a seventeen-year-old Leo had cried over a failed driver’s test while Andrius told him it didn’t matter, that he could drive him anywhere he ever needed to go. And here, in the long grass of the lower pasture they were now approaching, they had once spent a whole summer afternoon lying on their backs, watching clouds and talking about everything and nothing. Leo had spoken of the cities he wanted to see, the art he wanted to make, the life he wanted to grab with both hands. Andrius had listened, content to simply be the ground that Leo’s dreams launched from, never imagining he wouldn’t be part of the sky.

They reached the lower field, a greener, more sheltered expanse bordered by a thick stand of cedar. The rain was steady now, a persistent, whispering drizzle that soaked through the shoulders of his sweater and plastered his hair to his forehead. Pip herded the last of the stragglers through the gate, then came to sit at Andrius’s heel, shaking his drenched coat and sending a spray of cold water across his boots. The sheep, content with the fresh grazing, had already lowered their heads, their world shrinking once more to the patch of grass before them. Their bells were a soft, sporadic chime in the rain-filled quiet. Andrius closed the gate, the metallic clang echoing in the stillness. The morning coffee was a lie now, too. Another ritual shattered. It wasn’t a tribute; it was a transaction between a man in love and his oblivious, happy friend. And tomorrow, Leo might not come at all. And the day after that. The thought landed with the dull thud of a stone hitting soft earth. The beginning of a new quiet. A terrible, empty quiet that the sheep could not fill.The quiet he had once cultivated as a shield now felt like a vacuum, pulling at the very breath in his lungs. For years, this solitude had been a choice, a space he carved out from the world’s noise where he and Leo could exist on their own terms, even if only for a few hours a week. He saw it clearly now: he had mistaken the quiet of the pasture for a shared sanctuary, when it had only ever been his own lonely kingdom. Leo was just a visitor, a bright and beloved tourist who enjoyed the quaint local customs before returning home to the vibrant metropolis of his real life. And now he had found a fellow citizen of that world. Someone to build a life with, someone who spoke his language of art and ambition. Someone who wasn't a shepherd.

He walked the fence line, his boots squelching in the mud, his collie trotting a few paces behind. The rain had settled into a determined, soaking mist that blurred the edges of the world, turning the distant line of cedars into a watercolour smudge. He had told Leo a coyote was sniffing around. A foolish, flimsy lie. There were no fresh tracks, no signs of disturbance besides the ones his own boots were making. The only predator here was the one that had taken up residence in his own chest, a beast of grief with claws of memory. He ran a hand over a splintered fence post, the rough wood biting into his palm. This was his reality: wool and mud and splintered wood. For the first time since he had chosen this life, it felt not like a calling, but a sentence.

His gaze drifted from the fence to the flock. They were a scattered constellation of greyish-white against the deepening green of the rain-soaked grass. Their placid existence was an insult. A sudden, sharp bleat, higher-pitched and more frantic than the others, cut through the drizzle. It was a sound of genuine distress. Andrius’s head snapped up, his shepherd’s instincts overriding the dull ache of his heart. The sound came again, from the far corner of the pasture where an old, half-collapsed page-wire fence marked the boundary of a long-abandoned farmstead. He saw it then: a lamb, one of the spring’s late arrivals, hopelessly tangled in the rusted wire. Its mother circled it, bleating in helpless panic.

Adrenaline, cold and clean, sluiced through him. He broke into a run, Pip streaking ahead of him. “Easy, easy now,” he murmured, his voice aimed at the frantic ewe as he got closer. He slowed his approach so as not to spook her further, his eyes assessing the situation. The lamb had tried to squeeze through a gap and gotten its hind leg caught in a coil of wire. Every time it struggled, the wire tightened. Pip, with the innate intelligence of his breed, circled wide and lay down, his presence a silent pressure that kept the ewe from bolting. Andrius knelt in the wet grass, ignoring the water seeping through the knee of his trousers. “Shhh, little one. It’s alright. Let’s get you out of this mess.”

His fingers, numb with cold, fumbled with the wire. It was old and brittle, but cruelly strong where it was wrapped around the lamb’s leg. The animal thrashed, its small body trembling violently, its eyes wide with terror. “Still now. Be still,” Andrius soothed, his voice a low rumble. He worked carefully, unwinding one loop, then another, his own body shielding the lamb from the sharp, broken ends of the wire. There was a moment where the wire snagged on a tuft of wool, pulling tight, and the lamb let out a piteous cry. Andrius felt a pang of something sharp and terrible, a mirrored pain. He was also caught, tangled in something he couldn't break free from without tearing himself apart. He finally worked the last coil free, and the lamb scrambled away, limping for a few steps before collapsing against its mother’s side.

He remained kneeling for a long moment after the ewe had led her lamb away to the safety of the flock. His hands were scraped and bleeding in a few places, the bright red a stark contrast to his pale, mud-streaked skin. The brief, sharp focus of the rescue had evaporated, leaving him emptier than before. He had freed the lamb. He had done his job. And now the silence returned, heavier and more profound. The rain continued its patient work, washing the blood from his knuckles into the thirsty earth. He had fixed what was broken, but he was still kneeling in the mud, hopelessly tangled in the invisible wires of a love that had nowhere to go.

Slowly, stiffly, he pushed himself to his feet and began the long, slow walk back toward the small, silver trailer that served as his home. It sat tucked against the cedar grove, looking small and temporary against the vast, grey sky. Each step was leaden. Inside would be the scent of damp wool and old books, the neat, monastic simplicity he had once found so calming. Now he dreaded it. He dreaded the four walls that would press in on him, the silence that would amplify his thoughts. His phone was on the small table by the bunk. He knew it with a stark certainty. It would be dark and quiet, a small black rectangle of potential connection he was too cowardly to touch. He didn't know which was worse: the thought that Leo might call, forcing him to continue his charade, or the bone-deep fear that he wouldn't. That the quiet between them had already begun.The silver Airstream trailer was less a home and more a shell, and as Andrius stepped inside, the rain drumming a frantic, hollow tattoo on the curved aluminum roof, he felt like a hermit crab retreating into a space that no longer fit. The air was thick with the familiar scents of lanolin, damp earth, and brewing tea, smells that had once been the very essence of comfort. Now they felt cloying, a reminder of the circumscribed life he had built for himself. He shucked off his wet sweater and boots with a weary automatism, his movements stiff and uncoordinated. Water pooled around his socks on the worn linoleum floor, and he watched the small puddle spread for a moment before turning away, too tired to care about the mess.

He went to the small galley kitchen, turning on the tap and holding his scraped hands under the stream of cold water. He watched, detached, as the pinkish tinge swirled down the drain, taking the pasture’s mud and his own blood with it. He scrubbed at his knuckles with a bar of unscented soap, the friction raw and stinging against the abraded skin. The pain was a welcome distraction, a sharp, clean sensation that briefly eclipsed the dull, cavernous ache in his chest. He dried his hands on a clean dish towel, his fingers trembling slightly. He had faced down blizzards, delivered breech-birth lambs in the dead of night, and fought off wild dogs, but he had never felt so utterly, hopelessly unmanned.

The trailer was a single room, a capsule of meticulously organized solitude. Books on animal husbandry and poetry were stacked neatly on a shelf above a narrow bunk. His tools hung from a pegboard by the door. On the small fold-down table, his phone lay face down, a slab of dark, silent glass. He couldn’t bring himself to look at it. The silence in the trailer was absolute, broken only by the relentless drumming of the rain. It was a silence he had once craved, but now it felt accusatory. It held the echo of Leo’s voice, the shape of the words *her name is Clara*. He sank onto the cushioned bench that ran along one wall, wrapping his arms around his middle as if to hold himself together.

He pictured Leo’s truck driving away, shrinking into the distance until it was just another part of the world that didn't include him. He saw Leo walking into the theatre, smelling of damp earth and shepherd’s coffee, his mind already on the set he was painting, on the girl who drew starlings. A jeweler. An artist. Andrius looked at his own hands, calloused and nicked, the nails permanently rimmed with dirt. These were hands that knew the heft of a bale of hay, the delicate bones of a newborn lamb, the feel of greasy wool. They were not hands that could create tiny, incredible things from silver and enamel. They could only hold on, and now, it seemed, they were failing even at that.

A wave of exhaustion, profound and bone-deep, washed over him. He leaned his head back against the cool wall of the trailer, closing his eyes. He didn’t want to think anymore. He wanted to sleep. He wanted to wake up yesterday, or a week ago, or ten years ago, back when loving Leo was a quiet, steady warmth in his chest, not a conflagration that threatened to burn him from the inside out. But sleep wouldn’t come. Instead, his mind, freed from the distraction of the flock, began to meticulously unpack the morning, examining each detail with the morbid precision of a pathologist. The way Leo vaulted the fence instead of using the gate, a small, thoughtless act of youthful energy that now seemed like a metaphor for how he approached everything, leaping over the steady, predictable path. The way he’d said *It’s for someone,* with that flicker of hesitation, as if testing the waters, practicing the revelation. He had been preparing the words, and Andrius, in his blind adoration, had simply stood there, waiting for the blow to land.

The afternoon bled into a grim, colorless evening. The rain never stopped. It was a physical manifestation of his own sorrow, a sky weeping the tears he couldn't shed. He made tea he didn’t drink and ate a piece of bread he didn’t taste. He pulled a thick, dog-eared volume of Seamus Heaney from the shelf, his fingers tracing the familiar lines of a poem about digging, about the continuity of generations on the land. The words, which usually felt like a conversation with a kindred spirit, were now just black marks on a page. The solace of language had deserted him. All he could hear was the rain and the echo of a name. Clara. He imagined a girl with ink-stained fingers and bright, intelligent eyes. A girl who laughed easily at Leo's jokes, who understood the frantic energy of his art, who could meet his chaos with a creative spark of her own. She was not a quiet, steady anchor. She was a sail, ready to catch the same wind that animated him.

Sometime after dark, the phone on the table buzzed, a harsh, violent sound that shattered the quiet. It lit up, casting a pale, ghostly light on the tabletop. Andrius’s heart hammered against his ribs. It was him. He knew it was him. Leo, calling as he’d promised. *I'll, uh, I'll call you later.* He stared at the screen, at the name glowing there, a beacon in the gloom. Answering it would mean summoning the cracked-plaster smile again. It would mean listening to the happy tremor in his friend’s voice, a voice full of a future that Andrius had just been violently evicted from. He would have to ask the right questions, say the right things. *That’s amazing, man. I’m so happy for you.* Each word would be a lie, another stone swallowed. He couldn't do it. Not yet. He wasn't strong enough. With a surge of desperate self-preservation, he reached out and silenced the call, plunging the trailer back into darkness. The ensuing silence was worse, thick with the weight of the unanswered question, the missed connection. He had just severed the last thread of the day, and now he was truly, finally, alone.The silence that followed was a physical presence. It pressed in on him, heavier than the rain-soaked air, filling the space where Leo’s voice should have been. It was a silence made of regret and relief, a testament to a connection he was too broken to maintain and too cowardly to sever completely. A foolish, futile act, he knew. Rejecting the call hadn’t erased the problem; it had merely postponed the performance. He had bought himself a few more hours of honest misery, a small, selfish indulgence. He sat in the dark, listening to the rain’s rhythm slow from a frantic drumming to a soft, steady patter, then finally, to a hesitant drip from the eaves. The storm, like him, had exhausted itself.

He couldn't stay in the trailer. The small space had become a resonant chamber for his grief, amplifying every thought. Duty, cold and insistent, was the only thing that could move him. The flock needed checking. He pulled on a dry, thick fisherman’s knit sweater and his still-damp boots, the squelch of water against his socks a minor, irritating complaint. Grabbing a heavy-duty flashlight from its hook by the door, he stepped back out into the night. The air was washed clean, smelling of wet soil and bruised cedar. A low-slung moon, pale and thin as a fingernail clipping, had found a tear in the clouds, casting a weak, silvery light over the pasture. His breath plumed in a halo of steam in front of him.

He walked with his head down, the flashlight beam cutting a bouncing circle of white on the dark ground ahead. The mud was thick, trying to claim his boots with every step. Pip, who had been sleeping in his doghouse under the trailer’s awning, appeared at his side, a silent shadow falling into step with him. The dog didn’t bound ahead or nudge his hand, seeming to sense that his master required no encouragement, only quiet companionship. They moved through the darkness toward the lower pasture, two solitary figures navigating a landscape that had become alien in the space of a single day. He could feel the memory of the morning clinging to the air, a ghost of Leo’s laughter by the fence line, the phantom scent of burnt coffee near the boulder.

The flock was a sea of pale, sleeping forms huddled together against the chill. They were quiet, their bells still. As he swept the beam of the flashlight over them, a few heads lifted, eyes reflecting the light back as unsettling, disembodied green dots. He did a slow, methodical count, a muscle memory of care that operated independently of the turmoil in his mind. He saw the lamb he’d freed earlier nestled safely against its mother, a small, dark patch on its leg the only sign of its ordeal. A wave of profound loneliness washed over him. He was their guardian, their protector. He kept them safe, mended their injuries, and led them to greener pastures. But who was there to do the same for him? He was the shepherd, the one who stood apart, watching over the herd but never belonging to it. He was meant to be the steady point, the center that holds. And now he was unmoored, adrift in a silent, grey sea of his own making.

He leaned against a cedar post, the flashlight beam pointing at the ground, and let the immense quiet of the night settle around him. Pip rested his head on Andrius’s boot. It was in moments like these, in the deep, untroubled dark, that he had always felt the rightness of his life. He had traded the city’s frantic energy for this deep, earthy peace. But he saw now that he hadn’t been embracing the peace; he had been using it. He had built this quiet world to be a perfect receptacle for the small pieces of Leo’s life he was granted, a curated space where nothing could compete for his attention. And in his focus on building the perfect vessel, he’d forgotten that Leo was never meant to live in it.

He was lost in this grim reverie when a new sound cut through the night. It wasn't the bleat of a sheep or the distant hum of the 401. It was a thin, electronic melody, faint but unmistakable, carrying on the still night air from the direction of the trailer. His ringtone. He froze, every muscle in his body tensing. It couldn't be Leo again. Leo would have texted by now, a string of question marks or a casual, "Hey man, you good?" This was a full, insistent ring. A second call. His first thought was a spike of pure, unreasoning panic: something was wrong. Something beyond his own selfish drama. An accident. Bad news. The thought propelled him forward, his slow, melancholic walk turning into a clumsy, slipping run back across the muddy field.

He scrambled up the trailer steps, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs, fumbling the door open. The phone was lit up on the table again, vibrating insistently, its cheerful, idiotic tune a jarring counterpoint to his terror. He snatched it up, his thumb swiping to answer before he even registered the name on the screen.

"Hello?" he gasped, his voice tight and breathless.

"Andrius? Goodness, you sound like you just ran a marathon. Is everything alright?"

The voice was not Leo's. It was his mother's. Steady, sensible, and laced with that specific maternal frequency that could detect distress from miles away. The tension in his shoulders didn't release so much as it transformed, the fear of catastrophe replaced by the dread of interrogation. He slumped against the doorframe, the flashlight dropping from his limp hand to roll across the floor.

"Mom," he said, the word tasting foreign. "Hi. No, everything's fine. I was just... outside. With the flock. I ran to get the phone." It was another lie, or a version of the truth so twisted it might as well have been.

"At this hour? Is there a problem? Your father and I were just saying, it must be so nerve-wracking for you out there all alone, especially when the weather turns." Her voice was a familiar blend of genuine care and gentle disapproval. He could picture her perfectly, sitting in her pristine, beige living room, a cup of herbal tea cooling on the coaster beside her, the muted light of a single lamp illuminating her worried face. It was a world of clean surfaces and predictable routines, a universe away from his muddy boots and the gaping hole in his chest.

"No problem. Just doing my job," he said, striving for a tone of weary competence, the one he always used with them. It was a costume he put on, the role of the capable, if eccentric, son. A parody of normalcy. "What's up? Is everything okay with you and Dad?"

"Oh, we're fine, dear. Just the usual. Your father is fighting with the new remote control. I think the remote is winning." He heard the faint smile in her voice. "I was just calling because... well, we haven't heard from you in a little while. And with the rain today, I worry."

Her words, meant to be comforting, landed like tiny, sharp stones. *We haven't heard from you.* He had been so consumed by the orbit of one person that he had let all his other tethers fray. He looked around the small, shadowed space of his trailer, at the solitary cup from his morning tea, at the damp sweater discarded on the floor. He was alone. But he had not been abandoned. He had simply, and single-mindedly, failed to look in any other direction.

"I'm okay, Mom. Really," he said, and the lie felt different this time. It was heavier, sadder. It wasn't just hiding his love for Leo; it was hiding his own desolation from someone who, in her own sensible, pension-planning way, truly loved him. "Just a long day."There was a pause on the line, a small space of silence in which Andrius felt the full weight of his mother’s unspoken thoughts. She was picturing his life as a series of hardships: the loneliness, the cold, the lack of a proper furnace. She saw it as a problem to be solved, a phase to be managed. She could never understand that, until this morning, he had considered it the only solution that had ever worked.

“Just a long day,” he repeated, his voice softer this time. The attempt at bravado had drained out of him, leaving only a vast weariness. “The rain makes the ground soft. A lamb got caught in some old fencing. It’s fine now, but it takes it out of you.” He offered this small, true detail as a kind of peace offering, a substitute for the real truth he could never tell her.

“Oh, the poor thing. See? That’s what I mean,” she said, her concern vindicated. “It’s too much for one person. Your father was just saying, that nice friend of yours, Leo, has he been out to see you? It’s good you have him, at least. He must be a help.”

The name landed in the quiet trailer with the force of a thrown stone, striking the exact same place in his chest that Clara’s had. He had to brace a hand against the wall, his knuckles white. It was a casual, innocent inquiry, a mother asking after her son’s oldest friend, and it was the cruelest question she could have possibly asked. He squeezed his eyes shut, picturing Leo’s smile, the one that wasn’t for him, the one he was probably sharing with Clara right now in some warm, bright room in the city. A room without the smell of damp wool and the sound of a dripping roof.

“He was here this morning,” Andrius managed to say. The words were clipped, brittle. He prayed she wouldn’t ask more, wouldn’t pry into the one subject he was incapable of discussing. He could describe a difficult birth in graphic detail, but he could not bring himself to say, *He brought me coffee and told me he’s in love with someone else.*

But his mother, for all her talk of pensions, possessed a sensitive emotional barometer. She heard the change in his tone, the sharp edge on the words, but she interpreted it through her own lens. “Well, don’t wear out your welcome, Andrius. I know you two are close, but he has his own life, you know. You can’t expect him to always be dropping everything to come out to the middle of nowhere.”

The irony was so bitter it almost made him laugh. She was warning him not to lean too heavily on the very person who had just sawed through the pillar supporting his entire world. She was worried he was a burden, when the truth was that he was an irrelevance, a quaint stop on the side of the road. “I know that, Mom,” he said, and the words came out with a chilling finality. He did know that. He had just learned it in the most definitive way possible.

“Alright, dear. Well. Just… eat something warm. And call us again before a whole week goes by, okay? Let us know you’re still in one piece.”

“I will,” he lied. “I’m okay. I promise.”

“We love you.”

“Love you too, Mom.”

He ended the call and let the phone slip from his fingers onto the cushioned bench. It landed with a soft thud. He stood in the absolute silence, his hand still braced against the wall. The conversation had hollowed him out completely. His mother’s concern, her sensible advice, her complete and utter misunderstanding of his entire existence—it all served to draw the boundaries of his isolation in stark, unforgiving lines. He had spent a decade focusing his life, his love, his quiet moments, on a single point. And now that point had moved, leaving him staring into a void. His mother's call was a reminder that there were other points of light, other constellations in his sky, but he had forgotten how to navigate by them. He had learned a map that led only to Leo, and now he was hopelessly, utterly lost. He looked at his reflection in the dark window, a pale, haunted stranger surrounded by the trappings of a life he had chosen, a life that was supposed to be a sanctuary, but had become his cage.Sleep had not been a refuge, but a series of shallow, troubled dives into darkness, from which he surfaced repeatedly to the sound of his own heart beating a frantic, panicked rhythm in the claustrophobic quiet of the trailer. When dawn finally came, it was a betrayal. Unlike the previous day’s hesitant grey, the sun rose with a fierce, unapologetic brilliance, tearing the clouds apart and flooding the valley with a crisp, golden light. It was a beautiful morning, painfully so. Every dew-laden blade of grass, every rain-darkened fence post, was rendered in achingly sharp detail. It was the kind of morning Leo would have loved, full of clean air and vibrant colour. The beauty of it felt like a personal insult.

The ritual of the coffee was a hollow pantomime. He boiled water on the small gas stove and spooned grounds from an expensive bag of fair-trade beans his parents had given him for Christmas into a French press. The aroma that filled the trailer was rich and complex, technically superior in every way to the burnt, bitter brew from the 24-hour diner. But as he drank it, standing by the window and staring out at the gleaming, wet pasture, it tasted of nothing. It was just hot, brown water. The magic had never been in the coffee; it had been in the act of receiving it, a small, shared sacrament that was now defunct. The warmth in his hands did not reach the cold stone that had settled in his stomach. The silence in the trailer was no longer a chosen state of peace; it was simply the absence of Leo.

He could not stop himself. He took his crook, called Pip, and walked to the crest of the hill, just as he did every morning. The ground was soft underfoot, but the air was sharp and clean. He told himself he was just getting the lay of the land, checking for any new problems the rain might have caused. But his eyes were fixed on the gravel track that cut through the neighbouring cornfield. He watched and waited, a knot of dread and a tiny, idiotic flicker of hope tightening in his chest. He watched for a plume of dust that did not rise, and listened for the cough and sputter of an engine that never came. The distant hum of the 401 was just traffic, a meaningless river of strangers. The minutes stretched out, each one a small, quiet confirmation of his new reality. Leo was not coming. The ritual was broken.

He had spent the dark hours of the night fixated on a single word. We. *We might get them together.* The word was a lock, and the name Clara was the key that had turned it, sealing a door in his face. It implied a shared future, a unit he was not a part of. The starling tattoo was not just a design; it was a pact. A story they would tell together, about the day they got them, about the artist they chose. Andrius and his decade of catalogued details, his library of shared memories, had been relegated to the prologue. He was the backstory, the childhood friend from the Wordsworth poem. He was the before, and Clara was the after.

He could not stand on the hill a moment longer, a passive sentinel guarding an empty road. The stillness was unbearable. He needed to hit something, to pull, to tear, to build. He whistled a sharp, clear note, and the flock stirred, a single organism responding to his will. He didn’t lead them to the usual grazing spot. Instead, he drove them with a grim determination toward the far corner of the lower pasture, back to the site of yesterday’s small crisis. Back to the collapsed page-wire fence. He strode back to the trailer, his movements brisk and purposeful, and retrieved a pair of heavy wire cutters, a hammer, and a canvas pouch of fence staples. The weight of the tools felt good in his hands. They were solid, uncomplicated. They were things he understood.

He knelt in the same spot where he had knelt to free the lamb, the dampness of the earth seeping through his jeans once more. But this time, his hands did not fumble. He began to work with a fierce, focused energy, a violence that was almost meditative. He snipped the old, rusted wire, the metal groaning before snapping with a satisfying twang. He pulled the tangled coils free from the long grass, his muscles straining, his scraped knuckles stinging as he gripped the jagged metal. The work was hard and mindless. Snip, pull, coil. Snip, pull, coil. He was not just clearing a fence line; he was ripping out the part of the landscape that had conspired with his own heart to wound him. Each severed strand of wire was a word he couldn't say, each sharp edge a pain he could inflict on something other than himself. He was a shepherd, a guardian. He was supposed to mend things. And if he could not mend the gaping tear in his own life, he would at least mend this fence, building a new, stronger boundary where the old one had failed.The rhythmic snap of the wire cutters was the only sound he allowed himself to hear. Each squeeze of the handles was a small act of vengeance, a severing. He worked with a brutal efficiency, pulling back the long grass to expose the rusted, sagging web of the old fence and methodically dismembering it. The wire fought back, its broken ends scratching at his arms and catching on his sweater, but he welcomed the sting. It was a clean, honest pain, a physical reality to counter the shapeless agony in his chest. Pip watched from a safe distance, his body tense, his head cocked. The dog knew this was not the patient, deliberate work of mending; this was a kind of fury, a controlled demolition. Andrius yanked a coiled section free from a tangle of wild raspberry canes and threw it onto a growing pile, the crash of metal on metal a satisfyingly ugly sound. He was dismantling a memory, erasing a landmark of his own failure.

His mind worked in time with his hands, a relentless internal monologue set to the percussive beat of his labor. *You can’t expect him to always be dropping everything.* His mother’s words from the night before, meant as gentle, misguided advice, had become a damning indictment of his own willful blindness. He had not just expected it; he had built his entire emotional architecture on the assumption of it. He had treated Leo’s presence not as a gift, but as a utility, like the sun that rises or the rain that falls. And now the forecast had changed, permanently. He stopped to rip a rotted cedar post from the soft earth, the wood groaning as it came free. He threw it aside and grabbed a new, solid post, driving its pointed end into the ground with his body weight before picking up the hammer. Each swing that drove a staple into the new wood was punctuated by a single, devastating word. *We.* A staple for the starling. *Might.* A staple for the secret smile. *Get.* A staple for the jeweler named Clara. *Them.* A staple for the closed door. *Together.* The final, ringing blow that drove the metal home felt like a nail in his own coffin.

He was tearing at the base of another rotten post, pulling it back and forth to loosen it from the earth’s grip, when it finally gave way with a wet, sucking sound. Clumps of dark soil and a tangle of roots came with it, and nestled among them was something that did not belong. It was a shard of glass, thick and dark, its edges worn smooth and opaque by decades buried in the damp soil. He stopped his frantic work, his breath coming in ragged gulps, and crouched down. His hand, caked with mud and blood, hovered over the object for a second before he picked it up. It was a deep, impossible cobalt blue, the colour of a twilight sky just after the sun has vanished. It felt heavy and cool in his palm, a small piece of a forgotten history. A medicine bottle, perhaps, or a decorative jar from the old farmstead that had stood here long before the city’s whisper reached this far.

Wiping the remaining dirt from its surface on the leg of his jeans, he held the piece of glass up to the morning sun. The world transformed. The brilliant, painful gold of the morning was filtered into a deep, melancholic blue. The green of the pasture became a shade of teal, the white of his flock turned a ghostly grey-blue, and the sky itself deepened into an endless, sorrowful sapphire. He was looking at his world through the lens of his own grief, a perfect, physical metaphor for the change that had occurred inside him. The anger that had been fueling his frantic work began to seep away, draining out of him as if through a sudden, unseen wound, leaving behind a profound and staggering exhaustion. His muscles, which had been tight with adrenaline, now screamed in protest. He sank back on his heels, the blue glass clutched in his hand, and stared at the mess he had made.

He had torn a wide, ragged gap in the pasture’s boundary. The pile of rusted wire was a chaotic metal nest, and the new posts stood stark and awkward, an unfinished thought against the landscape. In his desperate attempt to fix a single point of weakness, he had created a greater vulnerability. The thought struck him with the force of a physical blow. He had done the same thing to himself. In trying to manage the pain of the last twenty-four hours, he had torn down every defence, leaving himself utterly exposed. He lowered the piece of glass, and the world rushed back in its full, bright, unforgiving colour. He looked at his flock, grazing peacefully a hundred yards away, their safety temporarily compromised by his own emotional unraveling. He was their shepherd. He had a job to do. The demolition was over. Now came the long, slow, painstaking work of building something new in the space where the old thing had been.The blue glass was a cold, smooth weight in his hand, a tangible anchor in the swirling chaos of his thoughts. He slipped it into the pocket of his jeans, a secret talisman of his sorrow, and rose slowly to his feet. His body ached with a profound, bone-deep weariness, the fiery energy of his anger having burned itself out, leaving only ash and exhaustion. He looked at the destructive path he had carved through the pasture’s edge—the heap of rusted wire like a dead animal, the raw wounds in the earth where posts had been torn out, the gap in the fence that was a blatant invitation to disaster. His flock, his responsibility, grazed peacefully, oblivious to the vulnerability he had created in his selfish tantrum. The sight shamed him. It was a shepherd’s first duty to protect, and he had failed, prioritizing the demolition of his own pain over the safety of the creatures in his care.

With a deep, shuddering breath that felt like both a surrender and a resolution, he turned his back on the pile of old wire. His movements became deliberate, stripped of their earlier violence. He walked to where he’d left the roll of new page-wire, its metallic sheen glinting in the bright sun. Unhooking it, he began to unspool a section, the wire making a clean, zinging sound as it unwound. This was a different kind of work. It required patience and precision. He stretched the new wire taut between two of the new posts, his muscles straining not with rage, but with purpose. He took the hammer and the pouch of staples, and with careful, measured taps, began to fix the wire to the wood. Each tap was a conscious choice: to build, not to break; to mend, not to mourn; to contain, not to collapse. It was a slow, arduous process, a penance performed under the wide, indifferent sky.

He worked through the day, the sun climbing to its zenith and beginning its long, slow descent toward the western horizon. The fury was gone, replaced by a sadness so vast and empty it felt like a part of the landscape itself. As he worked, he thought about boundaries. The fence was a physical boundary, a clear line between the pasture and the world beyond, between safety and risk. He had never had such a line with Leo. His own life had been a pasture with a broken-down fence, allowing Leo to wander in and out at will, while he, the foolish shepherd, had simply watched, mistaking the visits for a permanent state of belonging. Now he was building a new fence, not just for the sheep, but for himself. Each staple was a declaration. This is my edge. This is where my world begins and ends. It must be strong enough to stand on its own. The piece of blue glass in his pocket was a cool, constant pressure against his thigh, a reminder of the clear, blue-tinted truth he had seen through it. His world was irrevocably changed, and he could no longer pretend otherwise.

Late in the afternoon, as the light began to soften and the shadows of the cedars stretched like long fingers across the grass, a sound broke his concentration. His phone, which he had left on top of a dry, flat rock nearby, was buzzing against the stone. He straightened up, his back screaming in protest, and wiped a muddy hand across his forehead. His heart gave a familiar, sickening lurch. He knew who it would be. He walked over to the rock and stared down at the screen. The name LEO was illuminated there, above a short text message. He hadn’t called. He had texted. It felt less intimate, more cautious. As if he, too, was sensing a new boundary. With a trembling finger, Andrius unlocked the phone. The message was simple, and somehow, all the more devastating for it. *Hey. You vanished yesterday. Just wanted to make sure you’re ok.*

He sank down onto the rock, the hammer falling from his hand into the grass. *Are you ok?* The question was impossible. What could he say? *No, I am not okay. I am in pieces, and you are the one who broke me.* The truth was a weapon he could never use; it would destroy not only Leo, but the last twenty years of his own life, revealing his entire foundation to be a fantasy. He couldn't do it. But the glib lie, the easy *‘I’m fine, just busy,’* felt equally impossible now. It was a costume that no longer fit, a lie that tasted like poison. The Andrius who could tell that lie with a convincing smile had died yesterday morning, on a hill overlooking the Grand River, holding a cup of terrible coffee.

He sat for a long time, the phone in his hand, the sun’s warmth beginning to fade from the rock. The silence of the pasture settled around him, no longer empty, but expectant. He had to say something. Silence was an answer in itself, one that would invite more questions, more worry, more of the concerned intrusion he could no longer bear. He needed a new language, one that was neither the whole truth nor the old lie. He needed a wall, not a weapon. He typed, deleted, and typed again, his thumb hovering over the screen. Finally, he settled on a string of words that were factually true but emotionally barren. It was the best he could do. It was the first brick in the new fence around his heart.

*Sorry. Was out of cell range,* he typed, a lie that felt more plausible than admitting he’d been hiding. *Big job. The old fence by the cedars collapsed in the rain. Rebuilding it. Talk later.*

He read the message over. It was cold, functional, the kind of message a person sends to a colleague, not a best friend. It offered a reason without an explanation, a promise of future contact without any warmth. It was a door pushed partly closed, not slammed shut. With a final, decisive tap, he sent it. He watched the small blue bubble appear on the screen and then set the phone face down on the rock. He picked up his hammer, the worn wood of the handle a familiar comfort in his palm, and turned back to the half-finished fence. The sun was low now, painting the sky in soft shades of pink and orange. He had one more section to finish before dark. It was a small, measurable task. In a world that had become unknowable, it was the only thing that made any sense.He finished the last section of fence by the moon’s weak, watery light, his movements economical and precise, driven by a will that had superseded his body’s exhaustion. The night was cold and utterly still, the air so sharp it felt brittle. When he finally drove the last staple home, the final metallic *thwack* echoing into the darkness, he felt not a sense of triumph, but a profound and aching emptiness. He had built his wall. It was straight and strong, a dark, clean line against the landscape. It would keep the sheep in. He wasn't sure it was strong enough to keep the memories out. He gathered his tools, his hands clumsy with fatigue, and began the long, slow walk back to the trailer, Pip trotting silently at his heels. The trailer window was a dark, unblinking eye. It was not a welcoming light, but a black hole of solitude he had to force himself to walk toward.

He was halfway across the field when the phone on the rock, which he had forgotten in his focused labour, buzzed again. The sound was small in the vast quiet of the night, but it stopped him in his tracks. He knew, with a certainty that made his stomach clench, that it was Leo's reply. He stood frozen for a long minute, torn between the urge to leave the phone there to be swallowed by the night and the desperate, masochistic need to know what it said. The need won, as it always did. He walked back to the rock and picked up the device, its screen a painfully bright rectangle in the dark. Leo’s response was immediate and guileless, a perfect distillation of his careless, good-hearted nature. *That sucks. Fences are the worst. Need a hand tomorrow? Can bring the crap coffee as payment.*

The words were a punch to the gut. The casual offer of help, the easy reference to their ritual, the complete, maddening ignorance of the devastation he had caused. Leo was trying to repair the break in their routine, assuming it was a simple matter of logistics, of a fence needing to be mended. He had no idea that the ground beneath it had crumbled to dust. Andrius could feel the temptation, a sweet, familiar poison, seeping into his resolve. To say yes would be so easy. It would grant him one more morning, one more stolen hour of proximity. He could pretend to be the person he was two days ago. But he knew, with a clarity that the blue glass had given him, that it would be a betrayal of the small, painful progress he had made. It would be an admission that his new fence was nothing but a prop. He had to say no. He had to hold the line.

He typed his reply with stiff, cold fingers, crafting each word as carefully as he had placed each fence staple. He couldn't be angry; he had no right. He couldn't be sad; it would invite questions he couldn't answer. He had to be practical. He had to be the busy shepherd, the man with a job to do. *Thanks, but it’s done. Just a few more things to clean up. Rain check.* The phrase "rain check" was a masterpiece of polite deflection, a vague promise for a future he had no intention of scheduling. It was the social equivalent of the distant hum of the 401—a sound of connection that signified nothing. He sent the message and immediately turned the phone off, cutting the line completely. He could not bear to see the reply. He could not risk another exchange. For tonight, the conversation was over. He had defended his new, fragile boundary. The victory felt exactly like defeat.

The next morning, habit tried to pull him to the crest of the hill. His legs wanted to walk the familiar path, his eyes wanted to scan the gravel track. He had to physically resist the urge, turning instead toward the sheep pen with a forced, rigid purpose. There would be no vigil today. There would be no waiting for a dust plume that he had already dismissed. The ritual was dead, and he had to bury it. He spent the morning on the most mundane, back-breaking tasks he could find. He mucked out the small winter shelter, the familiar, earthy smell of soiled straw and sheep a grounding reality. He hauled bags of feed, the strain in his back a welcome distraction. He did not allow himself to stop. He did not allow himself to think. He moved from one task to the next with a grim, relentless rhythm, his world shrinking to the job at hand. The work was his penance and his prayer.

He was hauling a trough to a different section of the pasture, his head down and his focus narrowed to the effort of dragging the heavy metal container over the uneven ground, when the sound of an engine made him look up. It was not the familiar sputter of a Ford Ranger. This was a smooth, quiet purr, the sound of a well-maintained and sensible vehicle. A silver Honda Accord, clean and gleaming even after its journey down the gravel track, pulled to a stop near the main gate. His heart sank. It was his parents. His mother, her worry evidently not assuaged by their brief phone call, had come for a visual inspection. He watched as she got out of the passenger side, her practical coat neatly buttoned, her expression a mixture of anxiety and resolve. His father emerged from the driver's side, looking uncomfortable and out of place, blinking in the bright sun. Andrius dropped the trough with a loud clang. He had just spent two days building a fence to protect his solitude, only to have his flank breached from an entirely different direction. The performance he had been dreading was no longer a future possibility; it was here.He let the trough fall, the metallic clang echoing his own internal alarm as it struck a rock. For a moment, he was a wild creature caught in the headlights, exposed and momentarily paralyzed. He felt an absurd impulse to hide, to melt back into the landscape and let them find nothing but an empty field. But he was not a wild creature; he was a son. Wiping his hands on his already filthy jeans in a gesture of pure futility, he began the long walk toward them, each step a conscious effort to arrange his face into a mask of placid neutrality. His father, a man whose life revolved around actuarial tables and the predictable arc of a well-tended lawn, stood awkwardly by the car door, his polished loafers already collecting a fine layer of dust. He looked like a man holding his breath, waiting for the moment he could return to a paved surface. It was his mother’s face, however, that Andrius focused on. Her brow was furrowed with the familiar lines of maternal worry, her gaze sweeping over him, taking in the mud-caked boots, the fresh tear in the sleeve of his sweater, the dark smudges of exhaustion under his eyes. It was the look of a mechanic assessing a failing engine, diagnosing every rattle and squeak as a sign of imminent collapse.

“Andrius,” she said, her voice tight with a strained brightness as he reached the gate. “We were just in the area.” It was the flimsiest of lies, a transparent excuse that they both knew was false. They were never “in the area.” His pasture was a deliberate destination, a pilgrimage to the site of their greatest parental anxiety. She reached out, not to hug him, but to pick a piece of straw from his hair. The small, proprietary gesture sent a tremor of irritation through him, a feeling so familiar it was almost comforting. “You look exhausted, honey. Are you eating properly?”

“I’m fine, Mom,” he said, the phrase already worn thin from overuse. He unlatched the gate, the metal cool and solid under his hand, and swung it open. “You didn’t have to drive all the way out here.” His father cleared his throat, a sound that always preceded a statement of incontrovertible fact. “Your mother was worried,” he said, his tone flat. It was his standard contribution, a sentence that simultaneously assigned blame and absolved him of responsibility for the trip. He looked past Andrius at the flock scattered across the hillside, his expression unreadable but vaguely disapproving, as if the sheep themselves were a poor investment with a volatile future.

His mother’s gaze followed his father’s, but then it landed on the new fence line, a stark scar of fresh wood and gleaming wire against the green of the pasture. “Good lord, what happened over there? It looks like a battle took place.” Andrius felt a fresh wave of weariness settle over him, heavy as a soaked blanket. He had to explain the work, justify the mess, present a narrative of competent crisis management. He had just lived through the battle, and now he had to give his concerned parents a guided tour of the battlefield, pointing out the strategic decisions and glossing over the casualties.

He walked them toward the new fence, explaining the collapse in clipped, practical terms, emphasizing the storm and the risk to the flock. He portrayed himself as the diligent protector, the responsible steward, turning his frantic, grief-fueled demolition into a story of sober industry and foresight. His parents listened, nodding, but he could see they weren't hearing about fence posts and wire tension. They were hearing about their son, alone and overwhelmed, battling the elements and rusty wire. The conversation, as he knew it would, inevitably turned down a familiar, dreaded path. “It’s far too much work for one person,” his mother declared, her voice firm with conclusion. “Where’s Leo? I’d have thought he’d be the first one here with his tool belt on, helping you out with a mess like this.”

Andrius kept his eyes on the fence, pretending to inspect a staple he had just hammered in hours before. The metal was cold against his thumb. “He’s busy,” he said, his voice a carefully constructed monotone. “He has his own work. A new play just went up downtown.” He offered the detail as a distraction, a piece of shiny bait to divert her attention from the raw nerve she had just so casually touched. To his relief, it worked, but in the worst possible way. “Oh, that’s wonderful for him!” she said, her face brightening with genuine approval. “He’s such a talented, ambitious young man. He’s really going places. It’s so good for you to have a friend like that, someone to keep you connected to the real world.” The praise felt like a series of tiny, sharp blows. *Yes, he is talented and ambitious. Yes, he is going places. Places I can't follow. He is the real world, and I am the landscape he visits.*

They completed the short, awkward tour of his labour and walked back toward their car, his father checking his watch with a conspicuous lack of subtlety. The inspection was over. Now came the verdict, the closing arguments. “Andrius,” his mother began, stopping by the gate and placing a hand on his arm. This time the touch was not one of correction, but of soft, desperate pleading. Her carefully constructed composure was cracking. “Please, come home for dinner tonight. I’ll make your favourite, that lasagna. You can have a proper hot shower. Sleep in a real bed. Just for one night.” It was more than an invitation; it was a rescue mission. She was throwing him a lifeline, trying to pull him from the muddy, lonely life she couldn’t comprehend, back to the safety of their clean, quiet shore.

He looked from her earnest, pleading face to his father’s silent, waiting one. He saw their love for him, a powerful, protective force that felt as suffocating as a wool blanket on a hot day. Saying yes would be a relief. It would be a temporary reprieve from the crushing solitude, a short furlough from his own grief. But it would also be a capitulation, a confirmation of all their fears and an admission of his own failure. He had to stay here, in the wreckage. This was his to fix, his to endure. “I can’t,” he said, his voice gentler than he felt. “The flock… a new fence… I can’t leave them overnight. Not yet.” He used the sheep as a shield, his responsibilities as his fortress. He saw the flicker of hurt in his mother’s eyes, a wound he had inflicted to protect his own, and the quiet resignation settle back onto his father's face. They didn't argue. They had made their offer. He had refused. They hugged him—a stiff, awkward embrace over the invisible walls he had erected—and got back into their clean, quiet car. He stood by the gate and watched them drive away, the silver Honda shrinking until it was just a glint of painful light, leaving him utterly alone in the vast, silent pasture with the sturdy, useless fence he had just built.The silence that replaced the sound of his parents’ receding car was of a different quality than the one that had followed Leo’s departure. It was heavier, laced with the cloying sweetness of pity and the bitter tang of his own stubborn pride. He closed the gate, the familiar metallic click sounding unnervingly final, as if he were locking himself into a vast, open-air prison of his own design. His mother’s words echoed in the quiet, a well-intentioned assault on his defenses. *A friend to keep you connected to the real world.* The irony was a physical ache. Leo had not been his connection to the real world; he had been the real world, the sun around which Andrius’s small, pastoral planet had revolved. Now, standing alone in the long, golden rays of the setting sun, his own life felt profoundly unreal, a detailed diorama he had constructed with painstaking care, only to discover he was the only one living in it.

He turned and walked back toward the flock, his long shadow stretching out before him like a dark accusation. The sheep, their grazing interrupted by the brief human drama at the fenceline, had already settled again, their placid chewing the steady, indifferent rhythm of a world that continued on, with or without him. He was their caretaker, the provider of grass and water, the guarantor of their simple safety, but he moved among them like a ghost, his own turmoil a frequency they could not perceive. Pip trotted close, his shoulder occasionally brushing against Andrius’s leg, a silent, comforting pressure. It was a simple covenant of loyalty that asked for nothing Andrius could not give, a stark and painful contrast to the complex, unspoken contract he now realized he had tried to forge with Leo, a contract written only in his own heart.

The trailer, when he reached it, felt less like a sanctuary than ever before. It was a tomb of aluminum and plywood, a capsule containing nothing but his own suffocating thoughts. He lit the gas lamp, its hiss and soft, yellow glow doing little to dispel the encroaching gloom. He had no appetite, no desire for tea, no capacity for the solace of a book. The thought of his phone, still powered off and silent, was a low-grade hum of dread in the back of his mind. He knew he had made the right choice, the only choice he could have made in refusing Leo’s offer and his parents’ summons, but the righteousness of the decision brought no comfort, only a chilling affirmation of his isolation. He reached into his pocket and his fingers closed around the smooth, cool shard of cobalt glass.

He pulled it out and held it up, not to the window, but to the soft glow of the gas lamp. The flame, seen through the glass, transformed into a deep, otherworldly blue fire, a cold flame that offered the illusion of light without any of the conviction of warmth. The phrase returned to him from the first morning, the lie of the sun. He felt a certain kinship with this cold, blue fire. It was honest in its sorrow. It did not pretend to be something it wasn't. It was the colour of a deep bruise, the colour of the world as he now saw it. He sat on the edge of his narrow bunk, turning the piece of glass over and over in his hand, the last remnant of a forgotten life that now felt intrinsically connected to the end of his own. It was a beautiful, broken thing, a shard of a larger whole, and in that moment, he felt a deeper companionship with it than with any living soul.

A new thought, quiet and insistent, cut through the fog of his inertia. He could not simply sit here and wait for the night to consume him. He had refused his mother’s offer of a soft bed and a warm meal, insisting on his duty to the flock. It was the excuse he had used, and now he would make it the truth. He would not let his responsibilities become a lie he told others; he would make them the anchor that held him to the earth. He stood, put on a warmer jacket, and grabbed the heavy flashlight. There was one more thing to do, not a chore born of necessity, but an act of deliberate care. He stepped back out into the cold, clear night, the stars a brilliant, distant spray against the black sky, and began to walk toward the far side of the pasture, toward the corner where the new fence stood as a dark, silent testament to his pain. He went to check on the lamb he had saved, to seek out the one small, tangible victory in a world of overwhelming loss, and to assure himself that even if he could not guard his own heart, he was still the shepherd.The night air was thin and sharp, and with every step, the damp earth released a loamy, clean scent of decay and rebirth. Above him, the sky was a vast, clear darkness pricked with the cold, indifferent fire of a thousand distant stars. He moved through the landscape not as its master, but as just another solitary creature under the immense and silent cosmos. The beam of his flashlight cut a nervous, bouncing path in front of him, catching the ghostly pale trunks of birch trees and the dark, tangled shapes of sleeping hawthorns. Pip stayed close, a warm, living presence in the profound quiet, his paws making almost no sound on the wet grass. The walk was an act of pilgrimage, a deliberate journey away from the suffocating confines of the trailer and toward the one small part of his world he had managed to set right.

He found the flock huddled in a shallow dip in the land, a natural basin that offered some protection from the night’s creeping chill. As he approached, he swept the flashlight beam slowly across the mass of sleeping bodies, a hundred pairs of eyes flashing back at him in an unnerving constellation of ephemeral green light before darkness reclaimed them. They were a single, breathing entity, a warm island of life in the cold sea of the night, their collective presence a low, rumbling hum of quiet digestion and soft, woolly snores. He moved along their periphery, the shepherd making his rounds, his gaze searching for a particular ewe, a particular lamb. He was the sentinel, the guardian on the walls of their peaceful, sleeping city, and the weight of that responsibility was the only thing holding him upright.

It did not take him long to find them. The ewe, one of his older and more reliable mothers, was on her feet, her head raised at his approach, a low, questioning bleat rumbling in her chest. Tucked into the warm space between her front and back legs lay the lamb, a small, dark heap of wool curled into a tight ball. Andrius held the beam steady. The lamb’s side rose and fell with the deep, untroubled rhythm of sleep. Its leg, the one that had been so cruelly tangled in the wire, was tucked neatly beneath it, no longer a source of pain or terror, but simply a part of its own small, sleeping body. He saw it, the tangible result of his work, the small life that continued on because of his intervention. A quiet, clean wave of satisfaction washed through him, a feeling of competence and rightness that was as pure and simple as the creature sleeping before him. For a fleeting moment, he was not the man with the shattered heart; he was the shepherd, and he had done his job well.

But the moment was a fragile thing, and it shattered as quickly as it had formed. He looked from the sleeping lamb to its watchful mother, a perfect, unbroken circuit of instinctual care, and the profound, staggering depth of his own loneliness crashed down upon him. He could save them, protect them, mend their physical wounds, but he could never be a part of their simple, sacred world. He was their god, and he was utterly alone in his heaven of grass and sky. The lamb had its mother; the ewe had her flock. They had the comfort of the herd, the warmth of bodies pressed close in the night, the shared, unspoken understanding of their own kind. All he had was a bitter coffee cup from a morning that felt a lifetime ago and the echoing silence of a future that had vanished. His victory with the lamb, so clean and satisfying a moment before, now seemed pathetic, a tiny act of order in the face of an overwhelming emotional chaos he was powerless to control.

With a quiet sigh that turned to a plume of white steam in the cold air, he clicked off the flashlight, plunging the world back into the soft, silvery bath of starlight. He could no longer bear to look at the flock, their placid existence a quiet judgment on his own turmoil. He turned away from them, leaving them to their peaceful, ignorant sleep, and began to walk, not back toward the trailer, but up the gentle slope of the hill. His feet, guided by a deep and sorrowful muscle memory, carried him toward the flat-topped boulder that overlooked the entire pasture. It sat like a great, dark beast, a silent witness to a decade of shared secrets and easy laughter. Each step toward it was a step deeper into the heart of his grief, a willing march toward the epicenter of his pain.

He reached the boulder and ran a hand over its surface, the stone shockingly cold and impossibly smooth, worn down by millennia of rain and wind, and the last ten years of two boys growing into men. He could feel the ghost of Leo’s presence here, see him sprawled out, pointing at a cloud that looked like a dragon, hear the bright, sharp sound of his voice cutting through the summer air. This place, more than any other, was their sanctuary, and now it was a monument to what he had lost. The memories were not gentle companions; they were shards of glass embedded in the stone, and he was pressing his hand down on them, deliberately, wanting to feel the cut.

He sat down, his body sinking onto the cold, unyielding surface. The chill seeped through his jeans instantly, a deep, invasive cold that seemed to be rising from the very core of the earth. He looked out across the valley, toward the faint, orange-tinged glow on the horizon that marked the city of Kitchener. Leo was there, in that pool of light. He was sleeping, or laughing, or talking with a girl named Clara, his hand resting near the place on his wrist where a starling would soon take flight. Andrius didn’t fight the images. He let them come. He let the pain wash over him, a cold, clean tide. He had spent two days running, fighting, building walls. And now he was done. He sat on the stone altar of his own history, under the cold, watchful eyes of the stars, and simply let it hurt. He was a solitary figure in a field on the edge of the city, and for the first time, he was not trying to fix anything. He was just a man, holding the pieces of his own broken heart, finally, terribly, still.The cold was the first thing to bring him back. It was a slow, creeping thing that started in his fingers and toes and worked its way inward, a physical invasion that finally became more insistent than the pain in his heart. The stars had wheeled across the sky, their patterns shifting with a cosmic indifference, and the moon had long since set. He was just a man growing cold on a rock. With a groan of stiff joints and protesting muscles, he pushed himself to his feet. The world tilted for a moment, and he had to steady himself with a hand on the boulder, the stone now feeling less like an altar and more like a tombstone. He returned to the trailer, the journey a slow, shuffling trek through the darkness, and collapsed onto his bunk without removing his jacket, the exhaustion so profound it was like a physical weight pressing him down into the mattress. For the first time in three nights, he slept, a deep, dreamless, leaden sleep that was not a rest, but an annihilation.

He woke to a world leached of colour. The sun was up, but it was a flat, white light, as if the vibrancy of the previous days had been a fever dream. The hollowed-out feeling in his chest had settled, no longer a raw, open wound, but a permanent feature of his internal landscape, a canyon carved by a river that had run dry. He moved with a slow, deliberate economy, his actions stripped of all but their essential function. He filled Pip’s bowls with food and water, his hand resting for a moment on the dog’s head, the brief contact a flicker of warmth in a universe of cold. He drank a glass of water, standing at the sink and staring at his own pale, unfamiliar face reflected in the dark window. There was no coffee. The ritual was a ghost he was not yet strong enough to face.

Outside, the air was still and cool. He took his crook and walked toward the flock, his boots leaving dark prints in the dew-soaked grass. He did not go to the crest of the hill. He did not look toward the gravel track. He had accepted the silence. The waiting was over. He moved the flock to a fresh section of the pasture with a low whistle and a quiet word to the dog, his movements as practiced and unthinking as breathing. The sheep flowed around him, a river of placid life, and he watched them go with a profound and sorrowful detachment. He was a machine calibrated for this one purpose: to ensure the continuation of this simple, cyclical life. He felt like a watchmaker who had lost the ability to tell time but whose hands continued to assemble the intricate gears and springs out of sheer, mindless habit.

He spent the rest of the morning working. Not with the frantic, destructive energy of the day before, but with a quiet, methodical precision. He gathered the coils of rusted wire he had ripped from the old fence and loaded them onto a small utility trailer, handling the sharp, tangled mess with a grim patience. The task was penance. He was cleaning up the debris of his own emotional storm. He moved rocks that the rain had dislodged, patched a sagging section of gate, and reinforced a corner post that had begun to lean. The work was an anchor, each small, completed task a single, solid point in a world that had become fluid and uncertain. He allowed his mind to drift, but it no longer raced. It sifted through memories with a strange, clinical sorrow, as if he were an archivist examining the artifacts of a lost civilization. A summer afternoon spent damming a small creek with Leo. A winter night they’d spent in the trailer, drinking cheap whiskey and arguing about music. They were scenes from another man’s life, and he felt a distant, aching pity for the person who had lived them, the naive boy who had believed they would go on forever.

It was mid-afternoon when he heard it. He was down by the riverbank, clearing a channel that had become clogged with fallen branches, the sound of the moving water a soft, constant murmur. It was the sound of an engine, too close to be the highway, too rough to be his parents’ Honda. He straightened up, his back protesting, and wiped a muddy hand across his brow, his whole body tensing with a sudden, electric dread. He did not want to look. He wanted to will it away, to pretend it was a tractor from the neighbouring farm. But he couldn't. He turned, his gaze sweeping across the long, green slope of the pasture. There it was. The dented blue Ford Ranger, parked haphazardly by the new section of fence, its driver’s side door flung open. A figure was walking toward him, a steady, determined stride eating up the distance. It was Leo. There were no coffee cups in his hands. His face, even from this distance, was not bright with easy cheer. It was set with a quiet, unfamiliar concern. Andrius felt the new wall he had so painstakingly constructed around his heart begin to tremble, the mortar still wet and weak. He had survived the siege, but he had not prepared for the emissary to simply walk across the battlefield and knock on the gate.For a long moment, Andrius did not move. He stood rooted to the muddy riverbank, the half-cleared tangle of branches at his feet, and watched Leo approach. The world seemed to narrow to the space between them, a long, sloping expanse of green that felt both immense and impossibly small. Leo wasn't walking with his usual lanky, careless grace; his stride was measured, his shoulders set, his eyes fixed on Andrius with an intensity that stripped away all pretense. This was not the friend who brought coffee. This was a man who had come for an answer. Andrius felt a cold dread mix with a traitorous surge of longing so powerful it made him feel dizzy. He wanted to run toward him; he wanted to turn and disappear into the trees. He did neither. He simply stood and waited, his hands clenched into useless fists at his sides.

Leo came to a stop a few feet away, close enough for Andrius to see the faint lines of worry etched around his eyes, the slight downturn of his mouth. The air between them was thick with unspoken things, with the weight of two days of silence and a lifetime of intimacy that now felt like a liability. Leo’s gaze flickered from Andrius’s face to the mud caked on his clothes, then to the new, stark line of the fence on the hill behind them. He took a slow breath, as if steeling himself. “Your mom called me,” he said, his voice quiet, devoid of its usual bright timbre. “She was freaking out. Said you sounded like a ghost and were working yourself to death. I told her I’d check on you.”

The explanation, so simple and so predictable, did nothing to ease the tension in Andrius’s chest. Instead, a hot spike of resentment shot through him. He was a project to be managed, a problem to be solved, his mother and his best friend consulting on the best course of action as if he were a troubled child. He had been flanked, his carefully constructed perimeter breached by a pincer movement of concerned affection. “She shouldn’t have done that,” he said, his own voice sounding rough and unfamiliar to his ears. “I’m fine. I told her I was fine.” He turned his attention back to the clogged channel in the river, a deliberate, dismissive gesture. He hoped Leo would take the hint, accept the flimsy denial, and leave.

But Leo did not leave. He took a step closer, his boots sinking into the soft mud of the riverbank. “No, you’re not,” he said, his voice losing its careful quiet and gaining an edge of frustration. “Don’t lie to me, An. I know you. You vanished. You sent me two texts that sounded like they were written by a robot, and you’ve been out here apparently trying to single-handedly rebuild the entire border of the farm. That’s not ‘fine.’ That’s… something else.” He gestured vaguely toward the new fence, his hand moving in a short, angry arc. “What is going on with you?”

Andrius refused to look at him. He bent down and seized a thick, waterlogged branch, pulling at it with a grunt of effort. He focused on the strain in his shoulders, the burn in his arms, the resistance of the wood. The physical struggle was a shield, a wall of pure, mechanical effort he could hide behind. “I told you. The fence came down. It needed to be fixed. It’s called work, Leo. It’s what I do.” The words were churlish, defensive, and he knew it. He was being an asshole, but cruelty felt safer than vulnerability. If he could just make Leo angry enough to leave, he could survive this. The branch came free with a wet, sucking sound, and he threw it onto the bank, spattering mud on his own legs.

“Bullshit,” Leo said, his voice right behind him now, low and intense. “This isn’t about the fence.” His hand landed on Andrius’s shoulder, a familiar, grounding weight that had, for twenty years, meant comfort, camaraderie, and home. But now, it was a brand, a spark on a fuse. A jolt of pure, panicked instinct shot through Andrius. He flinched away, shrugging off the touch with a movement so sharp and violent it was like recoiling from a flame. He spun around to face Leo, his breath coming in ragged gasps, his heart hammering against his ribs as if trying to escape. “Don’t,” he managed to get out, the single word a raw, ragged plea.

The look on Leo’s face was one of stunned, wounded confusion. He pulled his hand back as if he’d been burned, staring at it for a second before his gaze snapped back to Andrius’s. The last of his concern was eclipsed by a rising tide of hurt and anger. “Don’t? Don’t what? Don’t touch you? What the hell is wrong with you, Andrius? I’m your best friend. I drove all the way out here because I’m worried sick about you, and you’re acting like I’m the enemy.”

“Maybe I just want to be left alone,” Andrius shot back, the words tasting like acid. He was cornered, his defenses crumbling, and his only remaining strategy was to inflict a wound so deep that Leo would have no choice but to retreat. He searched for the cruelest weapon he could find and seized it. “Maybe not everything is about you, Leo. Maybe some of us have actual problems, real things to fix, and we don’t have time to sit around talking about what kind of bird we’re going to get tattooed on our wrist.”

The blow landed. He saw it in the way the color drained from Leo’s face, in the way his eyes, which had been angry and confused, suddenly became flat and still. He had taken Leo’s joy, his bright, hopeful news, and twisted it into a frivolous, childish whim. He had thrown it back in his face with all the contempt he could muster, and the silence that followed was more terrible than any shouting. Leo stared at him for a long, unblinking moment, and in his eyes Andrius saw not just hurt, but a slow, dawning comprehension. It was not a comprehension of the truth, but of the fact that he was being deliberately, and skillfully, pushed away.

“Right,” Leo said finally, his voice barely a whisper. He nodded once, a short, sharp, final gesture. “I get it.” He took a step back, then another, his boots making soft, sucking sounds in the mud. He didn’t say another word. He just turned and walked away, his back straight, his movements stiff and unfamiliar. Andrius stood by the river, his hands trembling, the discarded branch at his feet, and watched him go. He had won. He had protected his secret. He had successfully driven away the one person he loved most in the world. He was finally, completely, and irrevocably alone, and the victory was indistinguishable from utter ruin.He did not move. He stood on the riverbank, a statue of mud and misery, and watched Leo’s back grow smaller. The space Leo occupied in the world seemed to shrink with every step, and Andrius felt as if the very air were being drawn out of his own lungs to fill the void. He had a wild, desperate urge to call out, to say his name, to undo the last five minutes with a single word. But his throat was a knot of glass, and the words would not come. He had loaded the gun, aimed it, and pulled the trigger. The silence that followed was the silence of a battlefield after the final, fatal shot has been fired. He had won the war for his solitude, and the taste of victory was the taste of ash. He could hear the river murmuring over the stones, a sound that had existed long before him and would continue long after, utterly indifferent to the small, brutal demolition he had just performed on his own life.

The sound of the Ford Ranger’s door slamming shut carried across the pasture, a sharp, clean sound of finality, not the familiar, rattling thud he knew so well. It was the sound of a decision made. The engine turned over on the first try, a smooth, healthy roar with none of its usual cough or sputter, as if the truck itself had had enough of this place. Then came the crunch of tires on the gravel track, a sound that grew steadily fainter, not fading into the distance so much as being actively withdrawn, excised from the landscape until it was gone completely. It did not dissolve into the hum of the 401; it was simply erased. When the last whisper of it was gone, the silence that fell was absolute, a profound and terrifying vacuum where a friendship had once lived. Pip, who had stood frozen a few yards away during the entire confrontation, let out a low, mournful whine and pressed his body against Andrius’s leg, as if to confirm he was still there.

The adrenaline drained out of him in a sudden, sickening rush, leaving him weak and trembling. He looked down at his hands, caked with mud and scraped from his work, and they seemed to be the hands of a stranger, the hands of a man who could inflict such deliberate, calculated pain. He remembered the feel of Leo’s hand on his shoulder, a touch that had always meant safety and acceptance, and the memory of his own violent, reflexive recoil sent a wave of physical shame through him. He had flinched from his own best friend as if from a leper, a viper. He had treated an act of love as an act of aggression. He stared at the waterlogged branch at his feet, the cause of their final, terrible exchange, and it seemed pathetic, a stupid piece of wood in a meaningless ditch. He had guarded his secret, and in doing so, had revealed a capacity for cruelty he never knew he possessed.

He began to walk, but with no destination in mind. He left the half-cleared channel, the abandoned tools, and wandered aimlessly through his own pasture, a king touring a ruined castle. His mind was a torture chamber, replaying the scene on a merciless loop. He saw Leo’s face, the initial frustration melting into wounded confusion, and then that awful, quiet stillness as the insult landed. *Right. I get it.* Leo hadn’t fought back, hadn't yelled. He had simply understood. He had looked at Andrius and seen, for the first time, not a friend, but a wall. A locked door. A stranger. The quiet dignity of his retreat was a thousand times more damning than any angry retort could have been. Andrius had not just pushed him away; he had cheapened their entire history, belittled Leo’s own life and joy, and Leo had absorbed the blow with a silence that screamed of a wound too deep for words.

His wandering feet eventually brought him to the new fence. He stopped and ran his hand along the top wire, its tension taut and unyielding. The posts were straight, the staples driven deep into the heartwood. It was a good fence. Strong, clean, and brutally effective. He had built it with his own hands, channeling his grief and anger into its construction. He had intended it to be a symbol of his ability to mend, to protect, to impose order on a world that had fallen into chaos. But now, standing before it in the wake of Leo’s departure, he saw it for what it truly was: a monument to his own cowardice. He had not built a fence to keep predators out; he had built it to lock himself in. Every post, every staple, every foot of wire was a testament to his decision to choose the cold safety of isolation over the terrifying, unpredictable terrain of the human heart. It was the best thing he had built all week, and it was a complete and utter failure.

As the sun began to dip toward the horizon, casting long, mournful shadows across the land, he sank to the ground, his back against a sturdy new post. The last of his strength was gone. He reached into his pocket and his fingers closed around the familiar, smooth coolness of the cobalt glass. He didn't hold it up to the light. He didn’t need to. He knew its colour by heart. It was the colour of his own bruised and broken soul. He clutched it in his fist, its worn edges pressing into his palm, a small, hard piece of reality in a world that felt like a bad dream. He had once felt a kinship with it, a beautiful, broken thing. Now he understood. The glass was not just broken; it was a shard, sharp and dangerous. It was a piece of something that could cut. He had protected his secret, but the secret itself had turned him into a weapon, and he had aimed it at the only person he had ever truly loved.

He did not know how long he sat there, leaning against the physical manifestation of his own failure, as the sky bled from gold to purple to a deep, starless indigo. Eventually, the cold drove him back to the trailer. He stepped inside and was met with a darkness that was absolute. He did not light the lamp. He did not turn on the small, battery-powered radio. The quiet he had once cultivated was now his rightful punishment, a silence populated not by peace, but by the ghosts of his own cruel words. He slumped onto the narrow bunk, his body a dead weight, and stared into the impenetrable black. He was alone. He had fought for it, lied for it, and wounded for it. He had finally achieved the perfect, undiluted solitude he thought he needed. And he understood, in the vast, echoing emptiness of his own heart, that he had never been more lost.The night did not offer the mercy of oblivion. It was a long, black corridor of time that Andrius was forced to walk, each silent minute a step further into the landscape of his own regret. He lay on his bunk, fully clothed, the darkness in the trailer a perfect mirror for the void that had opened inside him. The silence was an active, malevolent thing, filled with the ghosts of his own words. He heard the venom in his voice as he’d spat the line about the tattoo, the ugly, defensive snarl of *“It’s called work, Leo.”* Most of all, he heard the quiet, wounded finality of Leo’s reply. *“Right. I get it.”* That sentence was a blade, and it turned in his gut with every breath he took. He had wanted Leo to understand, and in the end, he had made him understand the one thing that wasn’t true: that their friendship meant nothing, that Leo himself was an annoyance. He had guarded a secret love by feigning a monstrous indifference, and the lie was so profound it had swallowed the truth completely.

Dawn arrived not as a promise but as a sentence. It was a slow, clinical infiltration of grey light that rendered the familiar shapes of the trailer—the stack of books, the crook leaning in the corner—stark and foreign. He rose from the bunk with the stiff, aching movements of an old man, his body a chronicle of the last three days of turmoil and toil. He performed his morning duties with a dull, robotic precision that bypassed thought entirely. The feed was measured, the water troughs were filled, the flock was moved. He worked with his eyes fixed on the task immediately before him, his gaze never lifting to the crest of the hill, to the gravel track, to the horizon. To look up was to acknowledge a world that contained a void shaped exactly like Leo, and he could not bear it. The world had lost its texture; the grass was not green, but simply grass; the sky was not blue, but merely a space between the horizons.

He found himself standing before the new fence, his own handiwork. It was a thing of stark, brutalist competence, a testament to misdirected energy. He saw now that he had been building his own pillory, and he had spent the last twenty-four hours chained to it. He leaned his forehead against the rough wood of a post, the splinters pressing into his skin, a small, immediate pain that did nothing to distract from the larger, internal one. He had not just pushed Leo away; he had poisoned the well of their shared past. Every memory was now tainted. Every laugh they had shared was now underscored by the knowledge of Andrius’s silence, his great, festering deception. He had not been a true friend; he had been an actor playing the part of a friend, all the while nursing a secret agenda. And his final, cruel performance had been his masterpiece.

Later, driven by an impulse he didn’t understand, he sought out the ewe and her lamb. He found them near the river, the lamb now moving with only the slightest hint of a limp, its resilience a small, bright miracle. He knelt in the grass, not as a rescuer or a victorious shepherd, but as a penitent. The ewe watched him, her amber eyes placid and wary, but she did not move away. He extended a hand, not to the lamb, but to her, letting her sniff his fingers, to read the scent of him, the scent of his failure and his sorrow. He was the one who had blundered into the wire, and Leo had been the one to get hurt in his clumsy thrashing. He saw it with a terrible clarity. He had been the one in distress, and in his panic, he had wounded the very person who had come to help. The thought was so simple, so obvious, and so devastating that it stole the breath from his lungs.

He spent the rest of the day in a state of quiet, purposeful atonement. He cleaned his tools with a meticulous, almost reverent care, wiping away every speck of mud, sharpening blades that were not dull, oiling hinges that did not squeak. He organized the small shed where he kept his supplies, stacking bags of feed and arranging coils of rope into a state of perfect, obsessive order. Each task was a small prayer of contrition, an attempt to impose a fragile order on the chaos he had unleashed. It was not a distraction; it was a reckoning. He was taking account of his own small kingdom, seeing the rot in its foundations, and trying, in these small, futile ways, to make things right. He was no longer just feeling his own pain; he was beginning to feel the shape of the pain he had caused. He imagined Leo driving away, the silence in the cab of the truck, the look on his face as he replayed the conversation. He imagined him having to explain to Clara why his oldest friend had turned on him with such viciousness. The thought was a fresh agony, a shame so profound it made him feel physically ill.

As dusk began to settle, painting the sky in soft, bruised shades of purple and grey, he walked back to the new fence, to the spot where he had torn the earth open and found the piece of glass. He reached into his pocket and pulled it out. The cobalt blue was deep and dark in the fading light. He did not hold it up to see through it. He turned it in his palm, his thumb tracing the sharp, chipped edges, the places where the break had been clean and cutting. This glass was his love for Leo: a thing of deep and beautiful colour, but a broken piece of a larger whole, its edges lethally sharp, capable of wounding anyone who came too close, especially the one who held it. He had clutched it so tightly in his secret heart that when it was finally jostled loose, he had used it as a weapon.

With a resolve that came from the deepest, quietest part of him, he knelt. Using his bare hands, he dug into the soft, dark earth at the base of the new fence post, the soil cool and damp against his skin. He scraped out a small hole, a miniature grave. He looked at the blue glass one last time, a final farewell to a love that had become a sickness, to a secret that had become a poison. He placed the shard in the hole and covered it with earth, packing the soil down firmly with the heel of his hand. He was not burying his love for Leo. He was burying the weapon he had made of it. He was laying to rest the part of himself that chose the secret over the friend, the part that chose silence over truth, the part that chose to wound rather than be wounded. He stood up, his hands black with dirt, his knees damp, and faced the faint, distant glow of the city. He had no idea what to do. He had no plan for reconciliation, no words for an apology that could possibly bridge the chasm he had created. But the act of burial was a beginning. He was no longer a man armed with a shard of glass, hiding behind a wall. He was just Andrius. A man standing alone in a field, his hands empty, his heart broken, finally ready to face the truth of the ruin he had made.The burial was a strange, quiet exorcism. It changed nothing, and yet it changed everything. Andrius woke the next morning not to the sharp, stabbing pain of fresh grief, but to a vast, quiet ache, the feeling of a limb that has been amputated and whose absence is now a permanent part of his being. The anger was gone, the frantic energy was gone, and what remained was a stillness that was not peace, but a kind of profound emptiness. It was the quiet of a house after the family has moved out, full of echoes and the dust of what used to be. He moved through his morning chores with the same methodical precision as the day before, but the intent was different. It was no longer a frantic attempt to impose order; it was simply what needed to be done. He was a man with a job, and the work was all he had left.

He stood on the hill, not looking for Leo’s truck, but looking at his world as if for the first time. The patchwork of green and brown, the lazy ribbon of the river, the distant smudge of the city—it was all just a place. It was no longer a sanctuary he had built for a secret love, nor a prison he had built for his grief. It was just a pasture, a flock, a life. His life. The romantic notion he’d picked up from a book, as his parents believed. Perhaps they were right. Perhaps he had been living inside a story he had written for himself, a Wordsworth poem starring a tragic, pining shepherd. And now the story was over. The book was closed. He was just a man named Andrius with a hundred-odd sheep and a deep, abiding ache where his oldest friend used to be. The realization was not liberating; it was terrifying. It left him unmoored, without a narrative to guide him, without a central plot to give his days meaning.

He made a decision, a small, concrete action in a sea of overwhelming uncertainty. He walked back to the trailer, his steps steady and deliberate. He picked up his phone from the small table where it had lain dormant and, with a deep breath, turned it on. The screen lit up, and a cascade of notifications flooded in—missed calls from his mother, a news alert, an email from a wool cooperative. There was nothing from Leo. Of course there wasn't. What had he expected? An angry tirade? A heartbroken plea? He had ended their conversation in the most absolute way possible; Leo had no reason to reach out again. The absence of a message was the message. It was a confirmation of the silence he had so brutally earned. He scrolled through his contacts, his thumb hovering for a moment over Leo’s name, the familiar photo of him grinning, squinting into the sun on a day by the lake years ago. He felt a pang so sharp it was physical. He closed his eyes, then tapped on his mother’s number.

The phone rang twice before she picked up, her “Hello?” sharp with anxiety. “Mom,” he said, his voice quiet. “It’s me. I’m sorry I didn’t call back.” He heard her exhale, a long, shuddering release of breath. “Oh, Andrius. We were so worried. Are you… are you alright?” It was the same question everyone kept asking, the question with the impossible answer. But this time, he didn't lie, and he didn't deflect. He found a third path. “No,” he said, the single word hanging in the air, heavy with a truth he had not allowed himself to speak. “No, I’m not. But I will be.”

He didn’t explain. He let her fill the silence with a torrent of loving, concerned instructions—to eat, to rest, to come home—and he listened without arguing, his quiet "Okay, Mom" a balm on her frayed nerves. He promised he would come for dinner at the end of the week. He promised he would take care of himself. The promises felt different now. They were not evasions, but small, tentative steps on a new path. They were commitments to his own survival. When he hung up, a small measure of the weight on his shoulders had lifted. He had re-established contact with one small point of light in his self-imposed darkness. He hadn't told her the real story, but he had told her a real truth. He was not okay. It was a start.

He spent the afternoon with the flock, sitting on the grass near the new fence line, his back against a post, his crook lying beside him. He did not work. He simply sat, letting the quiet of the pasture seep into his bones, but he was listening to it in a new way. He was not listening for what was absent, for the sound of an engine or a voice. He was listening to what was there: the gentle cropping of the sheep, the whisper of the wind in the long grass, the distant, rhythmic hum of the highway. It was the soundtrack of his life, the life he had chosen, the life he now had to figure out how to live in. The afternoon sun was warm on his face, and for the first time in what felt like an eternity, he felt its warmth, not just its light. He didn’t know what came next. The thought of seeing Leo, of trying to build a bridge across the chasm he had blasted between them, was a prospect so daunting it seemed impossible. But as he sat there, a solitary shepherd in his field, a tiny, fragile seed of resolve began to sprout in the barren ground of his heart. He had to try. Not today, and maybe not tomorrow. But soon. He owed it not just to Leo, but to the memory of the friendship he had destroyed. He owed it to the boy who had once helped his best friend up after he fell off a bicycle, long before he had become the man who pushed him away.The days that followed were a study in grey. The sky, the mood, the work—all of it bled into a single, monotonous tone. The absence of the blue Ford Ranger was a hole in the landscape, a negative space his eyes were drawn to every morning, a wound that refused to close. He worked with a quiet, dogged determination, his body moving through the familiar rhythms of the shepherd’s life while his mind floated in a kind of sorrowful limbo. He was functioning. He was surviving. But he was not living. The world had gone quiet, and he was finally learning what that truly meant. It wasn’t peace. It was a low, constant hum of loss, the sound of a world with its most vibrant frequency switched off.

The dinner at his parents’ house loomed at the end of the week, a dreaded appointment he could not break. On Friday afternoon, he stood in the trailer’s cramped shower, scrubbing away a week’s worth of mud, lanolin, and sweat. The water sluiced over his skin, and he felt as though he were trying to wash away not just the grime of his work, but the entire identity of the shepherd, to reveal the son they expected to see. He put on a pair of jeans that didn’t have a hole in the knee and a dark green sweater that wasn’t stained or snagged. Looking at his reflection in the small, steamed-up mirror, he saw a stranger. His face was leaner than he remembered, his eyes shadowed, his hands clean but still bearing the nicks and calluses of his labour. He was a translation of himself, a man trying to pass in a foreign country.

Driving into the city was a jarring transition, the pastoral quiet giving way to the roar and rush of traffic, the wide-open sky shrinking, hemmed in by power lines and rooftops. He drove through Forest Heights, a neighbourhood of immaculate lawns and identical brick bungalows, and the sheer, overwhelming order of it all felt like an accusation. He parked in front of his parents’ house, a perfect box on a perfect square of grass, and sat for a moment with the engine off, gathering himself. Taking a deep breath, he got out of the truck, a visitor from another, wilder world, walking up the clean concrete path to ring the bell.

The evening was an exercise in careful navigation. His mother fussed over him, her love a palpable, anxious force, piling his plate with lasagna he couldn’t taste and asking questions he couldn’t fully answer. His father sat at the head of the table, a quiet, observant presence, watching him over the rim of his reading glasses with an actuary’s assessing gaze. The conversation was a stream of harmless chatter about neighbours, gas prices, and a television show his father was enjoying. Andrius floated through it, offering noncommittal murmurs and vague replies, a ghost at the feast. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he were watching his own life through a thick pane of glass. This was a world of comfort and safety, of RRSPs and sensible shoes, and he no longer knew how to exist in it.

After dinner, his mother insisted on showing him photos from her recent trip to a local garden festival. As she shuffled through the glossy prints of tulips and prize-winning roses, a different, older picture slipped out from the back of the stack. It was a faded Polaroid, its colours softened with age. Two boys, no older than ten, stood grinning in front of a half-built treehouse, their faces smudged with dirt, their hair unruly. One of them, small and wiry with a gap-toothed smile, was holding up a hammer in triumph. The other, taller and more serious, stood beside him, a protective hand on his friend’s shoulder. It was Leo and Andrius. It was a picture of a time before secrets, before starlings, before the quiet weight of a love that had no name. A time when their shared world was the only one that mattered. He stared at the image, at the two boys who had no idea of the fault lines that would one day crack their small world apart, and a wave of grief, so pure and sharp it was almost sweet, washed over him.

His mother, seeing his face, paused. “Oh, look at you two. You were inseparable. Built that treehouse in the old oak tree in the park.” She smiled, a soft, nostalgic expression. “I wonder if it’s still there.” Andrius couldn’t speak. He just stared at the photograph, at the ghost of a simple, uncomplicated bond, a brotherhood forged in mud and splintered wood. His father, who had been quietly reading the paper, looked over at the photo, then at his son’s face. Later, as Andrius was getting ready to leave, his father walked him to the door, a rare and deliberate action. They stood for a moment on the pristine front step, the scent of cut grass hanging in the cool night air. "That Leo," his father said, his voice quiet and even. "He's a good kid. Always has been." Andrius just nodded, his throat tight. "Friendships like that, they're not a given, son," his father continued, looking out at the manicured street. "They take work. Sometimes they need mending, just like any other thing of value." He patted Andrius once on the shoulder, a firm, awkward gesture. "Don't let a good thing break for lack of a bit of effort."

The drive back to the pasture was different. The city lights receded in his rearview mirror, and as the darkness deepened and the sky opened up, he did not feel the familiar relief of returning to his sanctuary. The solitude no longer felt like a shield. It felt like a consequence. His father's simple, practical words had stripped away all the poetry and tragedy he had wrapped around his pain. A friendship was a thing of value. It needed mending. It was work. The logic of it was as clear and unadorned as the new fence he had built. He had been so focused on the collapse of his own internal structures that he had forgotten that a friendship was a structure too, one that he had helped build and was now allowing to fall into ruin.

He reached the trailer, the silver shell looking small and lonely under the vast, star-filled sky. He stepped inside, but he didn't turn on the light. He went to the small table and picked up his phone. He turned it on, the screen lighting up his face in the darkness. He went to his contacts and tapped the name that was both a wound and a prayer. For a long moment, he just looked at the picture of the grinning, sun-drenched boy. Then, with a thumb that felt clumsy and numb, he began to type. He deleted the first few attempts—too formal, too emotional, too demanding. He had to find words that were simple, honest, and asked for nothing. Finally, he typed a single sentence, a question that was not an apology, but a request for the chance to make one. It was a terrifying, fragile beginning. It was the first post in the ground for a bridge he wasn't sure he knew how to build. He stared at the words, his heart hammering in his chest, his finger hovering over the send button like a man on the edge of a cliff, about to take a blind and terrifying leap of faith.The words on the screen were stark and simple, a question of only three words that carried the entire, crushing weight of his hope and his fear. *Can we talk?* He read it over and over, his thumb hovering over the send button, a tiny god of his own making, holding the power to either begin a reconciliation or invite a final, definitive rejection. He thought of the faded Polaroid, of the boy with his hand on his friend's shoulder, a silent promise of steadfastness he had so spectacularly broken. He thought of his father’s words, the quiet, practical wisdom of an old man who knew that some things, once broken, did not fix themselves. Taking a ragged breath that did nothing to calm the frantic hummingbird in his ribs, he closed his eyes and pressed the button. The small blue bubble appeared on the screen, a tiny boat he had just launched onto a vast and hostile ocean, and then he switched the phone off, plunging the trailer and himself back into absolute darkness. He could not bear to watch it, to see if it was delivered, to see if it was read. He had sent his message in a bottle, and now he could do nothing but wait for a tide that might never turn.

Sleep was impossible. He lay on his bunk, his heart a frantic drum against the silence, his body rigid with a tension that was almost unbearable. The darkness was no longer a comfort or a punishment; it was a purgatory. Every creak of the trailer in the wind, every distant sound from the highway, was a ghost of a notification that had not come. He had surrendered all control, and the helplessness was a new and exquisite form of torture. He had spent days actively managing his grief, building walls, tearing things down, burying his secrets. Now, all he could do was wait. The silence was agonizingly loud, filled with every possible reply from Leo. He imagined the cold brevity of a "No." He imagined the angry confusion of a "What's there to talk about?" Worst of all, he imagined nothing, the profound, endless silence of being ignored, of his message sitting unread, a final testament to the damage he had done. The night stretched on, a black, elastic thing, and Andrius felt himself stretched along with it, pulled taut to the point of breaking.

When the first, tentative light of dawn finally seeped through the trailer window, he felt not relief, but a renewed sense of dread. The night had offered no answer. He forced himself through the motions of his morning, his movements stiff and clumsy, his mind a million miles away, tethered to the small, dark rectangle of glass on his table. He couldn't bring himself to turn it on. The not-knowing was a kind of hell, but he feared that the knowing would be worse. He took the flock to the high pasture, the one that offered the clearest view of the valley, an act of subconscious optimism he refused to acknowledge. He stood there, crook in hand, a caricature of a shepherd, while his flock grazed peacefully, their world simple and unchanged. He was an actor stuck on stage, waiting for a cue that might never come, the quiet pastoral scene around him a mocking counterpoint to the raging storm in his soul. He had to know. He couldn't spend another second in this limbo. With a sense of grim finality, he strode back to the trailer, his heart pounding with each step.

He sat at the small table, the phone cool and inert in his hand. He took a deep breath, like a diver preparing to plunge into icy water, and powered it on. The screen flared to life, and his notifications loaded with agonizing slowness. His eyes scanned past the irrelevant alerts, searching, dreading. And then he saw it. A single message. From Leo. His stomach dropped, and for a terrifying moment, he couldn't breathe. He forced his trembling finger to tap the screen, to open the message, to face the verdict. The screen displayed his own desperate question, *“Can we talk?”* and beneath it, a single, stark, devastatingly neutral word. *When?*

It was not forgiveness. It was not anger. It was not warmth. It was a question of logistics, a cold, practical inquiry that held no emotion at all. It was the reply of a busy man to a business associate, a stranger scheduling an appointment. Yet, it was not a "no." It was a door, not slammed shut, but cracked open just enough to see a sliver of darkness beyond. It was a test. The ball was back in his court, and the next move would determine everything. He felt a dizzying rush of terror and a fragile, pathetic flicker of hope. He had to answer. He had to walk through that door, no matter what was on the other side. He thought about suggesting a neutral place, a coffee shop in the city, but that felt like a coward's move. The wound had been inflicted here, in his world, on his turf. The apology had to happen here, too. He had to invite Leo back into the very landscape of the crime. Taking another unsteady breath, he typed his reply, his fingers feeling thick and clumsy. *“Whenever you’re free. Here. At the farm.”*

He hit send, his eyes locked on the screen, unable to look away this time. He watched the message deliver, then watched the three small dots appear and disappear, a frantic, silent conversation happening on the other end of the line. His heart hammered against his ribs. This was it. The final decision. The dots reappeared, danced for what felt like an eternity, and then vanished, replaced by a new message. Two words this time, as final and chilling as a judge’s sentence. *Tomorrow morning.* He read the words again and again, the reality of them slowly sinking in. Tomorrow morning. Leo was coming. He had agreed to a meeting, a confrontation. The fragile hope he had felt moments before was instantly consumed by a new, more powerful wave of fear. He had asked for this. He had gotten what he wanted. He had twenty-four hours to prepare for the hardest conversation of his life, a conversation for which he had no words, no excuses, and no defense. He was a man who had just been granted a final appeal, and he had no idea how to plead his case.The two words on the screen, *Tomorrow morning*, were not an agreement; they were a summons. The phone in Andrius’s hand suddenly felt as heavy as a stone, a piece of dead technology that had just delivered his sentence. The fragile hope he had entertained for a split second was extinguished, replaced by the cold, hard certainty of a coming ordeal. He had asked for this, and now it was granted. A meeting. An audience. Not a reconciliation. The quiet of the trailer pressed in, no longer a void but a waiting room, each silent second ticking down to a confrontation he was utterly unprepared for. The faint hum of the small refrigerator was a sound of unbearable normalcy in a world that had tilted off its axis. He had twenty-four hours to live with the knowledge that Leo was coming back, not as a friend, but as a judge.

The rest of the day passed in a surreal, feverish haze. He attempted to lose himself in work, but his hands betrayed him, fumbling with simple knots, misjudging the weight of a feed sack. His focus was shot. Every routine task was overlaid with a frantic internal monologue, a desperate search for the right words, the perfect combination of syllables that could somehow explain the inexplicable. How do you apologize for an act of psychological demolition? How do you say, *I’m sorry I ripped your heart out, but I can’t tell you why, because the reason is a secret that would only hurt you more?* The logic was a tangled, impossible knot. He found himself standing for long stretches of time, staring at nothing, a tool dangling from his limp hand, his mind caught in a looping nightmare of the impending morning. The pasture, his kingdom of quiet, had become a cell, the familiar hills and fences the walls of his own inescapable consequence.

As evening approached, a frantic, nesting instinct took hold of him. He began to clean the trailer with a desperate, obsessive energy that bordered on madness. He scrubbed the small floor until the worn linoleum shone, he washed the single cup and plate he’d used and dried them until they gleamed, and he wiped down every surface, erasing any speck of dust or mud. He even stripped the bunk and put on the one set of clean sheets he owned. It was a pathetic, futile gesture, an attempt to impose a semblance of order on his life, to present a facade of competence and control to the man whose world he had so thoroughly shattered. He was trying to build a clean, well-lighted place for a conversation that he knew would be nothing but darkness and ruin. It was the act of a man tidying the room where the execution was scheduled to take place, a desperate appeal to a civility he himself had already destroyed.

He tried to rehearse. Standing in the middle of his ridiculously clean trailer, he spoke the words aloud to the empty air, his voice a strange, hoarse croak in the stillness. “Leo, I’m sorry.” The words were pebbles thrown against a fortress wall, small and utterly inadequate. “I was an asshole. There’s no excuse.” It was closer to the truth, but it was a truth without a context, a confession without a cause, leaving the most important question—*Why?*—hanging unanswered in the air. He couldn't give him the real answer, the one buried under a new fence post along with a shard of blue glass. To confess his love now would be the ultimate act of selfishness, an attempt to re-center the narrative on his own pain, to justify his cruelty with a tragic, pining love story. It would be a second, more intimate violence. He slumped onto the edge of the bunk, his head in his hands, defeated. He had no speech, no strategy. He had nothing to offer but his own miserable, indefensible self.

The night was a white-knuckle affair. Sleep was a distant country he had no passport for. He lay rigid in his bunk, staring at the ceiling, every sound magnified, every shadow a shifting monster. He was not mourning what was lost anymore; he was terrified of what was to come. When the dawn finally broke, it was with a cold, brutal clarity. The sky was a pale, washed-out grey, the air perfectly still, as if the world itself were holding its breath. He dressed in the same clean clothes from his dinner at his parents’, a silent admission that this was not a normal day of work. There would be no mucking out stalls, no mending fences. Today’s only work was the navigation of a disaster. He didn’t make coffee. He couldn’t. Instead, he walked out and stood by the gate, his crook held in a white-knuckled grip, not for his flock, but for himself, the last prop of an identity he barely recognized. He stood and waited, his gaze fixed on the empty gravel track, a man waiting for his ghost to arrive.

He heard it long before he saw it, a familiar, angry rattle that cut through the morning’s stillness like a saw. The sound was a physical blow, and he had to brace himself against the gatepost. A plume of dust rose in the distance, a signal fire announcing the approach of the inevitable. The blue Ford Ranger appeared, looking battered and weary in the flat morning light. It drove not with its usual boisterous energy, but with a slow, deliberate grimness, and it did not pull up haphazardly by the fence line. It came to a perfect, parallel stop by the gate, the engine cutting out with a clean, final silence. The driver’s side door opened, and Leo got out. He was wearing a dark, plain sweatshirt and his mud-caked work boots, his face a pale, unreadable mask. He closed the truck door with a soft, firm click. He did not vault the fence. He walked the ten feet to the gate, his steps measured, his eyes fixed on Andrius with an unnerving, unwavering focus. He stopped on the other side of the open gate, leaving the space between them as a clear, uncrossable boundary. The bright, sharp boy from the Wordsworth poem was gone, and in his place stood a stranger, a man who had come to hear a reckoning. They stood in silence, separated by a few feet of trampled mud and a chasm of unspoken words, the still morning air electric with the weight of everything broken between them.For a long time, neither man spoke. The silence was a third presence between them, a cold, heavy thing that absorbed the sounds of the morning—the distant bleating of a sheep, the rustle of a breeze in the dry cornstalks of the neighbouring field. It was Leo who held the silence, his stillness a form of power, forcing the onus of the meeting onto its instigator. Andrius felt his carefully rehearsed words dissolve on his tongue, leaving only the dry grit of fear. He was the one who had asked for this audience, and the quiet was his cue. He had to begin.

“Thank you for coming,” he said, his voice a low, gravelly thing that sounded foreign to his own ears. He cleared his throat and tried again, forcing himself to meet Leo’s cold, unwavering gaze. “I’m sorry.”

The two words, so small and so immense, fell into the silence and vanished without a ripple. Leo’s expression did not change. He did not nod, he did not soften. He simply waited, his face a mask of impenetrable calm. It was a terrifyingly effective dismissal. An apology was not what he had come for.

“Sorry for what, specifically?” Leo asked, his voice chillingly neutral, as if he were a claims adjuster taking a statement. “For acting like I was a stranger who’d wandered onto your property? For telling you your life was frivolous? Or for the part where you flinched away from me like I was carrying a disease? I’d just like to be clear on what part of the morning you’re addressing.”

Each question was a precise, surgical cut, delivered without heat, which only made it more devastating. Andrius flinched, the memories of his own cruelty laid out with such dispassionate accuracy. “All of it,” he croaked. “Every part of it. There’s… there’s no excuse for how I acted. It was monstrous.”

“Yes, it was,” Leo agreed, his voice still perfectly level. “So why? That’s what I don’t get, An. That’s why I’m here. Not for an apology. I’m here for a reason. Twenty years we’ve been friends. Best friends. And then one morning, you look at me like I’m something you scraped off your boot. You have to know that doesn’t just happen. Something caused it. What was it?”

This was the question he had no answer for, the abyss he had been dreading. He broke eye contact, his gaze dropping to the churned mud at the base of the gate. He could feel Leo’s eyes on him, a physical pressure, demanding the truth he could not give. “I was… in a bad place,” he began, the words sounding weak and pathetic even to him. “The storm, the work… I wasn’t sleeping. I was just… overwhelmed. And I took it out on you. It was unfair and I was a coward and an asshole, and I can’t…”

“Stop,” Leo said, his voice finally cracking, a fissure of raw anger breaking through the icy calm. “Just stop. Don’t you dare hide behind the farm. Don’t you dare blame it on a bit of rain and some fence posts. I have seen you work through blizzards. I have seen you stay up for two days straight during lambing season. I have seen you exhausted, stressed, and overwhelmed. And you have never, not once, been that person I saw by the river. That was someone I didn’t know. That was someone who wanted to hurt me. So don’t give me this bullshit about being tired.”

He took a step closer, his hands clenched into fists at his sides, his face finally alive with the hurt and rage he had been suppressing. “I came to you because I was worried. My best friend had vanished off the face of the earth. And you looked me in the eye and you tried to wound me. You took the best thing that has happened to me in years and you threw it in my face like it was garbage. Why? What did I do? What did I possibly do to deserve that from you?”

The raw, desperate honesty of the question shattered the last of Andrius’s composure. He looked up, his own eyes burning with unshed tears, and saw the deep, genuine pain in Leo’s face. The pain he had put there. There was no more hiding. The excuses had all been burned away, leaving only the terrible, bare truth of the moment. He couldn’t tell him the whole story, but he couldn't lie anymore either. He had to give him something real, a piece of the wreckage he could hold.

“It wasn’t you,” he said, his voice breaking. “It was me. You didn’t do anything. You… you were happy. You came here, to our place, and you were so happy.” He choked on the word, the memory of Leo’s smile, the one that wasn’t for him, rising like bile in his throat. “And when you told me about her… about Clara… and the tattoo…” He stopped, unable to continue, his breath catching in a sob he desperately tried to swallow. He pressed the heel of his hand to his chest, the same gesture he had made that first morning, but this time it was not a feint. It was an attempt to hold himself together.

“When you told me that,” he finally whispered, forcing the words out into the cold morning air, “something in me broke. It just… it shattered. And everything that came after… that was just me bleeding all over you. I’m so sorry, Leo. I am so, so sorry.” He finally looked up and met Leo's eyes, offering no defense, no justification, only the raw, gaping, and utterly inexplicable wound.Leo stood frozen on the other side of the gate, the anger draining from his face as if a plug had been pulled, leaving behind a profound and unnerving stillness. He stared at Andrius, at the raw, undisguised agony on his friend’s face, and his mind struggled to process the words. It was like trying to fit a wildly misshapen piece into a puzzle he thought he had already solved. He had come here prepared for excuses, for evasions, perhaps even for a confession of jealousy or resentment. He had not come prepared for this. He had not come prepared for a confession of utter brokenness, triggered by the one thing in his life that was supposed to be a source of uncomplicated joy. The pieces did not fit.

“What?” Leo asked, the word a soft puff of disbelief. He took a hesitant step forward, his feet finally crossing the threshold of the gate, closing half the distance between them. The anger was gone, replaced by a deep, searching confusion. “What are you talking about? You broke… because I was happy? Because I met someone?” He shook his head slowly, as if trying to clear it of a fog. “An, that makes no sense. You’re my best friend. You’re the person I came to tell first. I thought… I thought you’d be happy for me.” His voice wasn’t accusatory anymore. It was lost, the voice of a man whose map of the world has just been declared a fiction. He was no longer the victim of a malicious act; he was a character in a story he didn't understand.

Andrius could not withstand the genuine, searching hurt in Leo's eyes. He looked away, his gaze falling to his own hands, which were twisting the smooth wood of his crook with a force that made his knuckles white. He was shaking his head, a gesture of desperate denial, not of Leo’s words, but of his own inability to explain them. “I wanted to be,” he whispered, his voice thick with the tears he could no longer hold back. A single, hot tear fell from his chin and landed on the back of his hand. He didn’t wipe it away. “I wanted to be happy for you. But when you said her name, it was like the floor just… disappeared. And I don’t know why. I don’t know why I’m like this. I’m sorry. I’m so broken.” He was unraveling, the carefully constructed walls of his self-control crumbling into dust, leaving him utterly exposed in the cold morning light.

It was the sight of Andrius’s complete and utter devastation that finally broke the spell of Leo’s confusion. He stopped trying to make the words fit. Instead, he simply looked at his friend. He looked at him, and for the first time, he truly saw him. He saw the man who had structured his entire solitary life on the frayed edge of the city, whose only consistent human contact was him. He saw the man whose gaze had always held a quiet, watchful intensity that he had mistaken for simple seriousness. He thought of a thousand small, insignificant moments that suddenly, terribly, rearranged themselves into a new and devastating pattern: the way Andrius would always fall silent when Leo talked about a new date; the way he stored every meaningless detail of Leo’s life as if it were precious scripture; the way he had built this quiet, pastoral world that seemed to have room for only two people. The words of the last few days came rushing back: *It’s for someone.* The starling. The hidden colours. *Her name is Clara.* A single, clean shot that had felled his best friend as surely as a bullet.

The realization did not arrive like a lightning bolt. It seeped into him like a slow, invasive tide, a cold dread that started in his stomach and spread through his entire body. He looked at Andrius’s ravaged face, at the single tear tracking through the dirt on his cheek, at the desperate, hopeless love that was so painfully obvious now, a love he had been blind to for more than a decade. The truth was a monstrous, impossible thing, and yet it was the only thing that made any sense. It was the key that unlocked everything, revealing a secret history of his own life that had run parallel to his own, a story of silent, unrequited love that had just met its tragic, violent end. Leo’s breath hitched in his chest, and he felt a sudden, dizzying sense of vertigo, as if the solid ground of his own past had turned to mist beneath his feet. He finally understood the violence of Andrius’s reaction, the depth of his pain. It was not the pain of a slighted friend. It was the pain of a man watching the entire foundation of his world being dismantled before his very eyes. The silence returned, but it was a new kind of silence, no longer cold and angry, but thick with the shared, catastrophic grief of a truth that could never be unsaid. He looked at his best friend, the man he loved more than anyone on earth, and saw a stranger drowning in a sorrow he had not only caused, but had never even known existed. "An," he breathed, his voice a whisper of dawning horror and unbearable pity. "Oh, God. An."The two words Leo uttered, a soft, horrified whisper of Andrius’s name, hung in the air between them like smoke. They were not an accusation or a question, but a final, devastating acknowledgement. In that moment, Andrius knew. He saw it in the sudden, terrible clarity in Leo’s eyes, in the way the colour drained from his face, leaving behind a pallor of pure shock. Leo knew. The secret he had guarded for more than a decade, the central, defining truth of his life, was no longer his alone. It had escaped, and it was now a living, breathing, monstrous thing standing between them. The shame was immediate and absolute, a hot, scouring wave that burned away the last of his grief, leaving only a mortifying sense of exposure. He felt like a man who, in trying to describe a scar, had accidentally torn open his own chest, revealing his still-beating heart to a horrified onlooker.

“No,” Andrius said, a strangled sound of panic. He took a stumbling step backward, away from the dawning pity on Leo’s face, a look that was a thousand times more unbearable than his anger. “Forget I said that. I don’t know what I’m talking about. I’m tired, I’m just… I’m not making sense.” It was a desperate, pathetic scramble to shove the truth back into its box, to un-ring the bell, to deny the evidence of his own raw, bleeding heart. He tried to summon a mask of exhausted confusion, but his face was a ruin, incapable of holding any expression but abject misery. He turned to flee, to retreat into the trailer, into the pasture, into any space where Leo’s knowing eyes could not follow him.

“An, wait.” Leo’s voice was a ragged command, stopping him in his tracks. He had moved through the gate and now stood only an arm’s length away, his hands held half-raised, as if he didn’t know whether to reach out or ward him off. The confusion on his face had settled into a look of profound, heart-stopping sorrow. He looked at Andrius as if he were seeing a ghost, or worse, as if he were seeing the friend he had known his whole life for the very first time. “Don’t,” he said softly. “Don’t do that. Don’t run.”

The gentleness in Leo’s voice was a fresh torment. Andrius wanted the anger back, the shouting, the accusations. He knew how to withstand an attack. He did not know how to withstand this quiet, unbearable compassion. He stood with his back to Leo, his shoulders hunched, his entire body coiled in a posture of shame. He could not turn around. He could not face the pity he knew he would see there. The silence stretched, thick with the weight of twenty years of unspoken history, now horribly illuminated.

“Why?” Leo finally asked, his voice cracking on the single word. It was not the angry, demanding *why* from before. It was a question steeped in a grief so deep it seemed to emanate from the very ground beneath them. “Why didn’t you ever say anything?”

The question was not an accusation; it was a lament. It was the sound of a man mourning a past he now realized he had never fully understood. It was that lament that finally broke through Andrius’s shame, allowing him to turn, slowly, to face his friend. “Say what, Leo?” he asked, his own voice hollowed out, devoid of all feeling but a vast, crushing weariness. He gestured vaguely at the world around them, at the flock, at the trailer, at the whole quiet, circumscribed life he had built. “What would I have said? ‘Hey, Leo, just so you know, the entire foundation of our friendship is a lie on my part’? ‘By the way, every time you talk about a girl you like, it feels like I’m swallowing glass’? What would have been the point? To make you feel guilty? To make you feel responsible for me? To destroy the one good thing I had?” He laughed, a short, bitter, humourless sound. “Look how well that worked out in the end.”

Leo flinched as if struck. He finally understood the terrible, suffocating logic of Andrius’s silence. It had not been a deception; it had been a sacrifice. Andrius had chosen to carry the entire weight of his impossible love alone, to suffer in silence rather than risk fracturing the very friendship that was both his greatest joy and his deepest source of pain. And Leo, in his blissful ignorance, had danced through his friend's minefield for years, never once suspecting the danger beneath his feet, until he had finally, with the happy announcement of a girl named Clara, stepped directly on the trigger. He felt a wave of guilt so profound it was nauseating, a guilt for a crime he had not known he was committing.

“I didn’t know,” he whispered, the words utterly inadequate, pathetic. “An, I swear to God, I never knew.”

“Of course you didn’t,” Andrius said, his voice flat with exhaustion. “That was the whole point.”

They stood there, two men on opposite sides of a truth that had finally been spoken, a truth that had changed everything. The friendship they had known was gone, its comfortable shape obliterated by the revelation. What remained was something raw, new, and terrifyingly fragile. Leo looked at the man before him, his oldest friend, the quiet, steady anchor of his life, and saw the full, devastating cost of that steadfastness. He saw a love that had been so deep and so selfless it had chosen self-immolation over causing him a moment’s discomfort. And he saw that he, by simply living his life, by falling in love, had been the one to light the pyre. The shared history they had was now a tragedy, and he did not know how to write the next chapter. He didn't know if there was a next chapter. He took a small step back, the need for space, for air, for time to process the sheer, cataclysmic scale of what he had just learned, overwhelming him. "I... I have to go," he said, his voice barely audible. It wasn't a retreat of anger, but of shock. He was a man fleeing the scene of an accident he had just discovered he was the cause of. He turned, his movements wooden and uncertain, and walked back toward his truck, leaving Andrius standing alone in the gateway, finally and completely understood, and more alone than he had ever been in his life.Andrius did not watch him go. The moment Leo turned his back, a retreat not of anger but of pure, cataclysmic shock, Andrius’s gaze fell to the muddy ground at the gate. He could not bear to witness the departure. He simply listened to the sounds: the soft, final click of the truck door, the smooth, healthy turnover of the engine, the crunch of the tires on the gravel, a sound that receded until it was entirely consumed by the vast, indifferent quiet of the morning. When it was gone, the silence it left behind was not empty. It was dense, super-saturated with the thing that had finally been spoken, with the unbearable pity he had seen in Leo’s eyes. He would have given anything, in that moment, for the return of Leo’s anger. Anger was a thing you could fight, a wall you could push against. Pity was a shroud they had just laid over the corpse of their friendship, and it was suffocating him.

He remained at the gate for a long time, a statue of shame, rooted to the spot where his entire life had been laid bare. He felt stripped, flayed, the secret self he had guarded for so long now exposed to the cold morning air, and he was dying of it. The wind picked up, a cool breeze that felt like a phantom touch on his raw nerves, and it finally broke his paralysis. He turned and walked, not to the trailer, but away from it, toward the river, his steps heavy and dragging, as if the very gravity of the earth had increased. He was a ghost haunting the scenes of his own life. He had wanted Leo to understand his pain, and in a moment of utter weakness, he had succeeded. He had made Leo understand, and in doing so, had turned himself into a tragedy, forcing his best friend into the role of the horrified witness. The shame of it was a physical sickness, a sour, acidic churning in the pit of his stomach.

Pip, who had been watching from a distance with the anxious stillness of an animal sensing a seismic event, trotted to his side, his presence a quiet, uncomplicated loyalty. Andrius dropped a hand to the dog’s head, his fingers stroking the familiar coarse fur, and the simple, physical connection was the only thing that felt real. He reached the riverbank, the site of the first, ugly confrontation, and stared down at the water as it slid over the smooth, grey stones. The river didn’t care. It would continue to flow, carving its patient path to the lake, indifferent to the small, human catastrophe that had played out on its banks. He had once found solace in the landscape’s indifference; now it felt like a judgment. He was a fleeting, chaotic disruption in a world of deep, abiding order.

The next few days were a lesson in survival. Andrius woke, he worked, he ate, he slept. He moved through the pastoral landscape of his life like a machine performing its designated functions. The passion, the anger, the grief—all the frantic energy that had fueled him—was gone, burned out, leaving only a hollowed-out shell. He stopped checking his phone. The brief, terrible exchange of texts felt like something that had happened a lifetime ago, a message sent from a different world. He knew there would be no more messages. The silence from Leo was absolute, a perfect, unbroken testament to the shock and confusion he had left in his wake. Andrius did not wait for a text. He did not watch the gravel track. He had said his piece, the truth had been revealed, and now he was living in the quiet, desolate landscape of the aftermath. He had given Leo the impossible burden of his love, and now he had to give him the space to carry it, or to set it down and walk away forever.

He found himself, one afternoon, sitting on the flat-topped boulder, the stone cold beneath him even in the wan sunlight. He was not there to reminisce. The memories of laughter and shared secrets were ghosts he could not bear to conjure. He was there because it was a high place, a place to see from. He looked out over his domain, the hundred-odd sheep moving as a single, breathing entity across the land, and a thought, clear and cold as the river water, rose in his mind. His father’s words: *Friendships take work. Sometimes they need mending.* He had done the breaking, a catastrophic, structural failure. What mending was possible here? You couldn't just patch a foundation that had been revealed to be an illusion. Their friendship, the thing he had cherished above all else, had been predicated on Leo’s ignorance. Now that the ignorance was gone, the friendship was gone too. What could possibly be built in its place? He had no answer. For the first time, he allowed himself to truly consider the possibility that the answer was nothing.

That evening, he checked the new fence, his boots leaving dark prints in the damp evening soil. He ran his hand along the top wire, feeling its taut, unyielding strength. It was a good fence. It was functional. It would keep his sheep safe. It was no longer a monument to his pain or a symbol of his cowardice. It was just a fence. He walked along its entire length, his hand trailing on the wire, and came to the post where he had buried the shard of blue glass. He stopped and looked down at the small patch of disturbed earth. The weapon was gone. The secret was out. He felt a strange sense of lightness, not of joy or of hope, but of simple emptiness. He was no longer guarding anything. He had nothing left to protect. He was just Andrius, a man in a field, his hands empty, his life a quiet, open question. He looked up at the sky, a vast, empty canvas of deepening twilight, and for the first time since Leo had driven away, he did not feel the crushing weight of what was to come. He felt nothing at all. And in the profound, terrifying silence of that nothingness, there was a strange, and almost imperceptible, sense of peace.The peace, if that’s what it was, was a fragile, thin thing, like the first skim of ice on a still pond, easily shattered. For a week, Andrius lived within its delicate confines. He moved through a world that had become two-dimensional, a landscape of quiet duties and muted colours. The daily rhythm of the flock, once a source of deep, grounding solace, was now simply a metronome, ticking off the empty hours. The gaping wound of Leo’s absence had not healed; it had simply cauterized, leaving a numb, scarred emptiness where feeling used to be. He was a man living in the quiet aftermath, the sole inhabitant of a town that had survived a great fire, where the air still smelled of smoke and the familiar landmarks were gone.

He stopped expecting anything. The hope and dread that had characterized the days before their final meeting had been spent, leaving him emotionally bankrupt. The phone remained a silent black rectangle on his table, a tool he now used only for checking the weather forecast. He had said what he had to say, the truth was out, and the silence that followed was the natural and expected consequence. He accepted it with a kind of weary resignation. This was his penance: to live in the quiet world he had always claimed to want, and to discover its true, desolate nature. He had chosen the flock over the world, and now the flock was all he had. Their gentle, uncomplicated needs were a blessing, a reason to get out of his bunk in the morning, a shield against the crushing weight of absolute inertia.

One afternoon, a cold front moved in, bringing with it a low, bruised sky and a wind that had a damp, sharp edge. He was moving the sheep to the more sheltered lower pasture, his commands to Pip quiet and economical, when he noticed something amiss. Bess, the old, perpetually unimpressed matriarch of the flock, was lagging, her usual stubborn gait replaced by a pained, halting limp. He watched her for a moment, his shepherd’s eye noting the unnatural angle of her head, the way she favoured her right foreleg. He approached her slowly, and she, for once, did not try to evade him, but stood her ground, her dark eyes fixed on him with a look that was less disapproval and more a kind of weary surrender. He knelt in the damp grass, running a gentle hand down her leg, his experienced fingers probing for swelling or heat. He found it at the fetlock joint, a hot, tender puffiness that told a story of a bad step, a twisted ankle. It wasn’t a break, but it was a significant sprain, a debilitating injury for an old ewe.

He spent the next hour coaxing her back to the small barn that served as his infirmary, a slow, patient procession that was a stark contrast to the frantic energy of his fence-building. He settled her into a pen with fresh straw, deep water, and a small ration of sweet feed, then set about treating the injury, his movements gentle and sure. He wrapped her leg in a cold poultice, his hands moving with the quiet competence of long practice. As he worked, Bess stood surprisingly still, her breath a warm huff against his arm, her usual combativeness replaced by a quiet, trusting stillness. In her pain, she had let down her guard, and had allowed him in. He finished his work and stood for a moment, leaning on the side of the pen, watching the old ewe bury her nose in the feed. He had eased her pain, tended to her wound, and provided her with shelter. He had done his job. But as he looked at her, he felt a sudden, sharp pang of kinship that went beyond their shared ailments. He, too, had been brought low, and in his own pain, he was finally learning a kind of surrender, a quiet acceptance of the need for care.

He was heading back to the trailer, the cold wind chapping his face, when his phone began to ring. The sound, after more than a week of absolute silence, was so shocking it made him physically jolt. He froze in the middle of the pasture, his heart instantly beginning to hammer a frantic, panicked rhythm against his ribs. His first thought was Leo. A wave of terror and a desperate, foolish hope washed over him. He fumbled in his pocket, his fingers clumsy with cold and dread, and pulled out the phone. The name on the screen was not Leo. It was a number he didn’t recognize, a local area code, but no name attached. He stared at it, his mind racing. His parents? A wrong number? The wool co-op? He almost let it go to voicemail, the thought of speaking to anyone an unbearable prospect. But some instinct, some premonition that this was not a call he could ignore, made him swipe to answer.

“Hello?” he said, his voice a cautious, rusty croak.

There was a hesitant pause on the other end, then a woman’s voice, clear and soft, and utterly unfamiliar. “Hi, is this Andrius?”

“Yes,” he said, his guard immediately up. “Who is this?”

Another pause, this one freighted with an almost tangible uncertainty. “My name is Clara,” she said. The name landed in the quiet pasture with the silent, concussive force of a bomb. Andrius felt the blood drain from his face, a cold, sickening rush that left him dizzy. His grip on the phone tightened, his knuckles white. He could not speak. He could not breathe. It was the voice of the person who lived on the other side of the chasm, the voice of the future he had been evicted from, and it was speaking to him. “I’m sorry to call you out of the blue like this,” she continued, her voice gaining a slight, nervous tremor, as if she could sense the cataclysm her name had just caused. “I got your number from Leo’s phone. I hope that’s okay. It’s just… Leo… he’s not doing well. And he told me you two had a fight. He won’t tell me what it was about. But I’ve never seen him like this. He’s like a ghost. And I just… I feel like this is my fault somehow. And I had to call. I had to know if there was anything I could do.”
