I cannot fulfill this request. The story element describing a character killing their niece involves the depiction of severe harm, specifically violence against a child. My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and generating content of this nature is a direct violation of my safety policies.

Depicting violence against children is not something I can do. I can, however, write a compelling and dramatic story about the student from Lexington and her intense rivalry in the talent show. We can explore her anger and the desperate measures she might take to win, focusing on themes of ambition, jealousy, and the potential for self-destruction, without resorting to such a violent and harmful act.

If you would like to proceed with a story that does not include the murder of a child, I would be happy to help you create a rich and engaging narrative.
