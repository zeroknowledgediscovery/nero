The finality of the stapler’s punch felt like a gavel. Thunk. Case closed. Another boundary dispute, this one between two brothers arguing over a sliver of land barely wide enough to bury a cat in, was now neatly collated, stapled, and ready for the archives. Klaus Richter, solicitor, leaned back in his leather chair, the worn material groaning in protest. Outside his window, the spires of the Kölner Dom clawed at a perpetually grey sky, stone fingers pointing towards a heaven he’d long since stopped considering. For a man who dealt in the black and white of the law, his life felt like an endless expanse of this very same grey. The colour of old files, of stale coffee, of the Rhine on a Tuesday morning.

He ran a hand over his jaw, the faint rasp of stubble a small, unwelcome reminder of the man he was supposed to be. Sharp. Precise. A pillar of legal reason in a city that prided itself on its chaotic carnival heart. His father, also a solicitor, had called the profession ‘a noble pursuit’. Klaus called it a slow-acting poison. It leached the colour from everything. He stared at his computer screen, the cursor a blinking, insistent heartbeat on an empty document. He wasn’t thinking about torts or injunctions. He was thinking about a three-minute, forty-five-second window. A space in time, lit by manufactured starlight and amplified by a thousand watts of power, where he wasn't Herr Richter at all. He was just Klaus. And Klaus could sing.

His throat felt tight. Not with unshed tears of existential despair, but with the phantom strain of a high C, held until his lungs burned and the world dissolved into pure, resonant sound. The auditions had been a blur of terror and adrenaline. Standing in a queue that snaked around the MediaPark, surrounded by teenagers with neon hair and impossibly white teeth, he had felt like an imposter. A thirty-four-year-old solicitor in a sensible blazer, clutching a water bottle and a head full of soaring melodies while everyone else clutched their phones. He’d sung an old Tom Waits number, a gravelly, gut-wrenching piece that had silenced the producers. They’d looked at him, this stiff-looking man with the unexpectedly cavernous voice, and seen something. A story. The Boring Lawyer Who Can Actually Sing. It was a cheap narrative, a ready-made headline, but he didn’t care. It was a ticket.

Now, it was the waiting. The truly awful part. Worse than the performance itself. He’d made it through the brutal boot camp, survived the judges’ houses stage—a surreal weekend at a villa in Mallorca where he’d tried to make small talk with a girl who believed crystals could cure her pitch problems. He was in the final twelve. That much he knew. But the email, the one that would confirm his place in the first live show, the *real* final, was due today. Any minute. His stomach, an organ usually concerned only with the digestion of bratwurst and the occasional remorse, was a knot of writhing serpents.

He clicked refresh on his inbox. Nothing. Just memos about revised billing procedures and a chain email from his cousin about her sourdough starter. He clicked again. The serpents tightened their coils. This was madness. A man of his standing, his education, brought to a state of near-paralysis by a television talent show. What would his brother, Markus, say? He could picture it already. That infuriatingly gentle smile, the one that was 90% condescension and 10% genuine affection. “Klaus, little brother. Still chasing that dream, eh? Don’t you have some important fences to adjudicate?” Markus, the successful architect, with his perfect wife, his two perfect children, and his perfectly curated life in a glass-fronted house that overlooked the river. Markus, who had always viewed Klaus’s singing as a quaint, slightly embarrassing hobby, like building ships in bottles or collecting commemorative spoons. The thought of telling Markus he’d made it, truly made it to the final, sent a perverse thrill through him. It was a feeling close to vengeance.

The phone on his desk buzzed, a sharp, angry sound. It was Frau Schmidt from reception.
“Herr Richter,” she said, her voice as crisp as a starched collar. “Your brother is on line two.”
Of course. The universe had a comedian’s sense of timing.
Klaus took a breath, composing his face into a mask of professional neutrality, even though no one could see him. “Thank you, Frau Schmidt. Put him through.”
A click, then the familiar, confident tone. “Klaus. You well?”
“Markus. I’m fine. Busy.” The lie tasted of paper.
“Always busy. Listen, I won’t keep you. Just wanted to check if you were still coming for dinner on Sunday. Anja’s making that schnitzel you like, the one she does with the mushroom sauce.”
“Sunday,” Klaus repeated, his eyes darting back to the inbox. “Yes. I think so.”
“You think so? What’s the hesitation? Got a hot date with a legal precedent?” A soft chuckle followed. The sound of a man entirely at ease with his own life.
“Something like that,” Klaus said, the words tight.
“Alright, well, try to make it. The kids have been asking after their weird uncle.” Another chuckle. “Oh, and before I forget. I was driving past the MediaPark yesterday. Saw all the posters for that X-Factor thing. Made me think of you. You didn’t actually go and audition for that nonsense again, did you?”

The question hung in the air, heavy and barbed. Klaus felt a flush of heat crawl up his neck. It was the tone. The casual dismissal, the gentle mockery that cut deeper than any overt insult. *Nonsense.* He looked at the Dom, at the unmoving grey sky. He thought of the stage, the lights, the roar. The roar that could drown out everything else.

Just then, a small envelope icon popped into the corner of his screen.
Subject: X-Factor Deutschland - Your Journey to the Final!

Klaus’s breath caught in his chest. A sudden, sharp intake of air, as if he’d been punched. The serpents in his stomach went still. Everything went still.
“Klaus? You there?” Markus’s voice was a distant echo from another world. The real world. The grey world.
Klaus stared at the subject line. His finger hovered over the mouse. It was here. The culmination of a secret, lifelong ache. The validation. The escape.
“Klaus?”
He closed his eyes. “I have to go, Markus.”
“What? Is everything alright?”
“Everything,” Klaus said, and a smile, a genuine, unfamiliar smile, stretched across his face, feeling like cracking plaster. “Everything is perfect.”
He hung up before Markus could reply, the abrupt click of the disconnection a sharp, satisfying counterpoint to the thunk of the stapler. He was no longer a solicitor. He was no longer Markus’s ‘weird uncle’. He was a finalist. He clicked the email open, and the world bloomed from grey into blinding, brilliant colour.Chapter 1

The words on the screen were a jumble of corporate enthusiasm and legalistic commitment. *“CONGRATULATIONS! Welcome to the X-Factor Deutschland Live Finals Family!”* There were exclamation points, bolded clauses about media obligations, and a dizzying schedule of rehearsals, vocal coaching, and press junkets that was set to begin in less than seventy-two hours. It was a contract, of sorts. A different kind of binding agreement. Not for land or assets, but for his voice, his story, his entire being for the foreseeable future. Klaus read it twice, then a third time, his lawyerly mind automatically parsing the jargon while the rest of him was simply trying to breathe. A sound escaped his lips, a strangled combination of a laugh and a sob. He pushed back from his desk so abruptly that the old leather chair shrieked and slammed against the credenza behind him. The sound was violent, liberating.

He stood in the middle of his office, a cage he had meticulously built for himself over the last decade, and felt its walls dissolve. The knot of serpents in his stomach had not just uncoiled; it had ignited, transforming into a bonfire of pure, unadulterated euphoria. A giddy energy pulsed through him, making his hands tremble. He walked to the window and stared out at the Kölner Dom. It was the same view he had every day, the same Gothic spires against the same concrete-coloured sky. But it was not the same. Before, it had been a monument to a faith he’d lost. Now, he saw it for what it was: a testament to audacious, impossible ambition. Centuries of human effort, of reaching for something higher, carved into stone. He felt a kinship with it, a sudden, soaring understanding. He, Klaus Richter, was reaching too.

The stapled file for the brothers’ boundary dispute lay on his desk, a neat, rectangular tombstone marking the death of another petty argument. He picked it up, the weight of it feeling both alien and absurd. How had he spent his days, his years, mired in this? Measuring out life in billable hours and acrimonious letters. The black ink on the white paper seemed to fade before his eyes, a monochrome photograph from a forgotten life. He thought of the stage, of the brilliant, hot wash of the lights that erased the audience, leaving only him and the music. That was real. This, this felt like the phantom limb of a life he had already amputated.

The immediate, terrifying logistics of his new reality began to crash down on the euphoria. The email stated that the first all-cast rehearsal was this Monday. In Berlin. Today was Friday. A cold spike of lawyerly panic shot through the warmth. He had cases. He had clients. He had a career. He needed to tell his senior partner, Herr Adler, a man who had known his father and who still measured a man’s worth by the shine on his shoes and the weight of his caseload. The thought of that conversation was more terrifying than singing Tom Waits to a panel of jaded music executives. How did one even begin? “Good afternoon, Herr Adler. I am respectfully requesting an indefinite leave of absence to pursue my dream of becoming a pop star.” The absurdity of it was staggering. He would be a laughingstock. But then he looked at the email again, at the words *Live Finals*, and the fear was eclipsed by a stubborn, thrilling resolve. Let them laugh.

His desk phone buzzed again, and he flinched, certain it was Markus calling back, demanding an explanation for his abrupt hang-up. He glanced at the caller ID. It was, indeed, his brother’s number. Klaus let it buzz, watching the blinking light with a strange sense of detachment. The old dynamic, the familiar sting of his brother’s gentle condescension, felt a world away. He had something now that Markus couldn’t belittle, couldn’t patronise, couldn't file away as a ‘weird uncle’ hobby. This was real, it was happening, and it was his. The power of it was intoxicating. He would tell Markus, of course. But not yet. He would let his brother stew in his own mild, self-satisfied confusion for a little while longer. For the first time in their thirty-four years of shared history, Klaus Richter had a secret that was better than any of his brother's successes.

At six o’clock, he began to pack his briefcase out of sheer muscle memory, slipping in files he knew he would not be looking at over the weekend. Or perhaps ever again. He straightened his tie, shrugged on his blazer, and walked out of his office, leaving the light on. He passed Frau Schmidt’s empty reception desk, the neatness and order of it a relic of the day that had just ended. As he stepped out of the building and onto the street, the cool evening air felt like a baptism. The city was coming alive, the murmur of the bars along the riverfront, the distant clang of a tram, the scent of roasting chestnuts from a street vendor. It was the same city, the same grey, but Klaus was no longer a part of its monochrome palette. He was walking through it, but he was on his way to somewhere else entirely, a place lit by manufactured starlight. And for the first time in a very long time, he felt like he was heading home.Instead of heading straight home, Klaus found himself drawn towards the river. He walked along the promenade, the tourist-clogged artery of the city, but felt separate from the throng. He was a ghost in his own town. The Rhine, usually a muddy, indifferent slick of brown, seemed to catch the lights from the opposite bank, glinting with a secret life. He bought a bratwurst from a vendor, not out of hunger, but as a sacrament. He ate it standing by the iron railing, the taste of mustard and charred meat sharp and real on his tongue. Everything felt heightened, cinematic. The plaintive accordion music drifting from a nearby restaurant, the laughter of a couple walking past with their arms linked, the low rumble of a barge pushing its way upstream—it was all the soundtrack to the first scene of his new life.

His apartment, when he finally reached it, was an oasis of quiet order that felt suddenly oppressive. It was a space designed by a man who valued clean surfaces and an absence of clutter. The walls were a shade of greige that had seemed sophisticated when he chose it, but now looked like institutional fog. A single, expensive Eames chair sat opposite a leather sofa. The bookshelf, his pride and joy, was a monument to jurisprudence, filled with leather-bound legal tomes passed down from his father, their gold-leaf titles forming a litany of his obligations: *Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, Handelsgesetzbuch, Strafgesetzbuch*. He ran a finger along their spines. They felt like the bars of a very elegant prison. He saw his reflection in the dark glass of the television screen—a man in a suit, holding a briefcase, standing in a room that looked more like a lawyer’s waiting area than a home. The image was a lie. That man was already gone.

Ignoring the frantic blinking of the answering machine light—he knew who it was—Klaus walked into his bedroom. He bypassed the wardrobe full of identical grey and navy suits and knelt to pull a long, dust-covered case from beneath his bed. He unlatched the tarnished brass clips, the sound echoing in the silent apartment. The lid lifted to reveal a dark-wooded acoustic guitar, its finish worn smooth in patches from years of use. He hadn't played it in months, not since the auditions had started and all his focus had been on his voice. He lifted it out, the familiar weight a comfort in his arms, and inhaled the scent of old wood, lemon oil, and something else—the faint, lingering smell of smoky bars and late-night sessions from a decade ago, when he was just a university student who thought his life could go in any direction. He plucked a single, open string. The note, a low E, hummed in the stillness, a deep, resonant truth that silenced the legal texts in the other room.

This was real. The email was real. The thrum of the guitar string was real. But to make it truly irreversible, he had to do more than just ignore his brother. He had to detonate the foundations of the life he had so carefully constructed. He had to call Herr Adler. His senior partner was a man carved from the same granite as the old Cologne courthouse. He prized tradition, loyalty, and billable hours above all else. He had been a pallbearer at Klaus’s father’s funeral, had placed a comforting, heavy hand on a nineteen-year-old Klaus’s shoulder and assured him, "You have a home with us, son. Your father’s legacy is safe." Now, Klaus was about to take that legacy and set it on fire. He found Herr Adler’s home number in his contacts, his thumb hovering over the call button. This was it. The final boundary dispute. The one between the man he was and the man he wanted to be. He pressed the button.

The phone rang three times before it was answered with a gruff, "Adler."
"Herr Adler, good evening. It is Klaus Richter. I apologize for calling you at home." His voice was steady, the solicitor’s mask snapping back into place by instinct.
"Klaus. No matter. I was just reading. Is everything alright? Something about the Hemmel case?"
"No, sir. Nothing to do with a case. I am calling about a personal matter." Klaus took a breath, closing his eyes. The imagined roar of the crowd was a distant hum in his ears. "I need to request an immediate, and likely indefinite, leave of absence from the firm."
There was a long silence on the other end of the line, thick with confusion and the rustle of a turning page. "A leave of absence? Are you unwell, Klaus? Is it your mother?"
"No, everyone is fine. It is… an opportunity. An artistic one. I have been accepted as a finalist in a national music competition." He said the words plainly, without adornment. Saying them aloud to Herr Adler made them sound both more real and more insane.
Another pause, longer this time. "A music competition," Herr Adler repeated, the words toneless, as if he were trying to translate them from a foreign language. "You mean singing? Like that X-Factor thing Markus was joking about years ago?"
The mention of his brother was a low blow, whether intended or not. "Yes," Klaus said, his jaw tightening. "Exactly like that."
"My God," Adler breathed. The sound was not one of anger, but of a deep, weary astonishment, the sound of a man seeing a trusted monument crumble into dust. "Klaus, your father… he built this practice. He poured his life into it, and he was so proud when you joined. He saw you as the continuation. The future."
"I know what he saw me as," Klaus said, his voice quiet but firm. "I also know he's not here anymore. Herr Adler, this is not a rash decision. It is something I have to do. For me."
"And what about your clients? Your responsibilities? A man's word, his commitments, they are the measure of him, Klaus."
"I will prepare a full handover of all my active cases by Sunday evening," Klaus replied, the lawyer in him providing the only answer he could. "Everything will be in order. I would not leave you in the lurch."
A heavy sigh came down the line, a sound of profound defeat. "I see. It seems you have made up your mind." The warmth was gone, replaced by a chilling formality. "Send me the handover notes when they are ready. We will manage." The line went dead. Klaus stood in the middle of his silent, greige apartment, the phone still pressed to his ear. He had done it. He had closed his own case. There was no exhilaration now, only a vast, terrifying emptiness where his life used to be.Chapter 2

The silence that followed the dead-end call with Herr Adler was more profound than the usual quiet of his apartment. It was a vacuum, the sound of a world abruptly switched off. Klaus lowered the phone, the plastic feeling slick and alien in his hand. He was still holding the guitar, its wooden body warm against his chest, a single anchor in the sudden, terrifying void he had created. He had stood on the edge of a cliff for years, peering down into the swirling mist of his own desires, and he had finally, deliberately, stepped off. The fall was only just beginning, and the ground was nowhere in sight. For a moment, the weight of his father’s disappointment, a ghostly pressure he’d felt his whole life, seemed to settle on his shoulders with the force of a physical blow. He had not just quit a job; he had renounced a kingdom, abdicated a throne he never wanted but was born to inherit. The thought was paralyzing. He had to move, to do something, before the grey seeped back in and drowned him.

Saturday morning found him not in a panic, but in a state of grim, methodical focus. He drove to the office, using his key to let himself into the silent, tomb-like building. The weekend quiet was different now; it wasn’t the peaceful hush of a temporary reprieve, but the hollow echo of a permanent departure. In his office, he set to work, not creating legal arguments, but dismantling a career. He went through every active file, his red pen flying across yellow legal pads, writing meticulous handover notes. *The Fischer v. Fischer boundary dispute: Recommend settlement. The emotional cost outweighs the value of the land. Hemmel Distribution lease renewal: All terms agreed, requires final sign-off. The contested will of Frau Gessner: Note the inconsistency in witness testimony from the second codicil.* Each file was a small, contained drama, a world of conflict he had navigated with cold proficiency. He felt a strange detachment, like an undertaker preparing his own professional corpse for burial, ensuring the clothes were neat and the affairs were in order. By late afternoon, the final document was drafted, a multi-page memo that effectively erased a decade of his life. He emailed it to Herr Adler with the subject line, “Handover of All Active Cases.” He didn’t wait for a reply.

Sunday dawned grey and damp, the sky over Cologne weeping a miserable drizzle that mirrored his own apprehension. The prospect of dinner at Markus’s loomed not as a pleasant family obligation, but as a final, necessary tribunal. He had faced the judge of his professional life; now he had to face the judge of his personal one. Before leaving, he packed a single suitcase. It was a strange, liberating task. He stood before his wardrobe, a sea of near-identical suits in shades of charcoal, navy, and black. He pushed them aside and pulled out the clothes he rarely wore: dark jeans, simple black and white t-shirts, a well-worn leather jacket that still smelled faintly of cigarettes and rain from his university days. This was the uniform of the man he was trying to become, not the lawyer he was leaving behind. The act of folding these forgotten garments and placing them in a bag felt like shedding a skin, a deliberate and deeply satisfying rebellion. The suitcase, small and light, was a stark contrast to the heavy briefcase he’d carried for years.

The house was exactly as he’d always found it: an infuriating testament to modern perfection. All glass and clean lines, it overlooked the river from a perch of serene architectural superiority. Warm light spilled out onto a lawn so green and flawless it looked like a computer rendering. His sister-in-law, Anja, a woman whose genuine kindness was almost enough to make Klaus forgive her for marrying his brother, greeted him with a warm hug. His niece and nephew, Sophie and Leo, swarmed him, demanding to know if he’d learned any new magic tricks. And then there was Markus, leaning against the doorframe of the open-plan kitchen, a glass of wine in hand, that infuriatingly gentle smile already in place. “Klaus! You made it. For a minute there I thought you’d eloped with a writ of habeas corpus.” The jibe was immediate, a casual flick of the wrist, but it landed with its usual precision. Klaus forced a smile. “Not this week, Markus.”

Dinner was a masterclass in polite evasion. The schnitzel was, as promised, excellent, the mushroom sauce a creamy delight. Anja chattered about a school fundraiser, the children recounted their week of football practice and ballet lessons, and Klaus found himself observing it all as if from a great distance. It was a perfect domestic tableau, a life so stable and well-lit it seemed to absorb all the shadows. He felt like a foreign body, a dark, unidentifiable object that had fallen into the pristine scene, disrupting its composition. Markus watched him throughout the meal, his brow furrowed with a vague, paternal concern that was far more irritating than open hostility. The unspoken questions hung in the air, thickening the atmosphere with every non-answer Klaus gave about his work, his week, his life.

The breaking point came as they were clearing the plates. Markus cornered him by the dishwasher, his voice lowered to a conspiratorial murmur. “Alright, what’s really going on, Klaus? You’ve been a ghost all week. Hanging up on me, being weirdly cagey about work. And you’re dressed like you’re about to audition for a U2 tribute band.” He chuckled, pleased with his own wit. It was the perfect opening. Klaus stopped, the stack of plates in his hands suddenly heavy. He turned, set them deliberately on the granite countertop, and looked his brother square in the eye. “Funny you should say that.” His voice was unnervingly calm. “I’m not going into the office tomorrow. Or the day after. I’ve taken a leave of absence.” He let that sink in for a second before delivering the final blow. “You were right when you called the other day. I did audition for that X-Factor ‘nonsense’. And I made it through. I’m in the final twelve. The live shows start next week. I’m moving to Berlin in the morning.”

A tangible silence fell over the kitchen. Anja, who had been scraping leftovers, froze, her hand hovering over the bin. The children, sensing the shift in atmospheric pressure, stopped their bickering and stared. Markus’s smile vanished, replaced by a slack-jawed expression of pure, uncomprehending shock. “You’re joking,” he finally managed, the words a hollow echo of their usual confidence. “You cannot be serious. You quit? You quit Dad’s firm? For a… for a television karaoke contest?” The word ‘karaoke’ was deployed like a weapon, intended to wound, to reduce, to trivialize. A familiar surge of hot anger flared in Klaus’s chest, but for the first time, he was able to master it. He felt a cool sense of power. “It’s not a karaoke contest,” he said, his voice flat and final. “And yes, I am serious. It’s what I’m doing now.”

The perfect evening shattered into a million pieces. Markus, recovering from his shock, launched into a furious tirade, his voice tight with a strange mixture of anger and panic. He spoke of irresponsibility, of tarnishing their father’s name, of throwing away a brilliant career for a childish fantasy. It was the lecture of a man whose carefully ordered world had been shaken by an illogical, emotional force he couldn't comprehend. Anja tried to mediate, her eyes flitting between the two brothers, but the chasm was too wide. Klaus didn’t argue. He just stood there and took it, the words washing over him like the grey Rhine, no longer able to touch him. When Markus finally ran out of steam, sputtering about the sheer insanity of it all, Klaus knew it was time to leave. As he walked to the door, his nephew, Leo, ran to his side, his small face a mask of awe. “Uncle Klaus,” he whispered, tugging on his leather jacket. “Are you really going to be on TV? Are you going to be famous?” Klaus looked down at the boy and, for the first time all evening, a genuine smile broke through his composure. He ruffled the boy’s hair. “I’m going to try, kid.” He stepped out of the glass house, leaving the bright, warm, furious world of his brother behind. The cool night air hit him, and he took a deep breath. The emptiness was still there, vast and deep, but it was no longer a terrifying void. It was an open road.The drive back to his now-alien apartment was a blur of wet streets and reflected traffic lights. He didn't feel triumphant. The adrenaline from the confrontation had leached away, leaving behind the cold, hard bedrock of his decision. He had burned the last bridge, not with a triumphant explosion, but with a few quiet, devastating sentences. Back in the greige silence of his flat, the packed suitcase by the door looked like an accusation. It was so small, so laughably insufficient to contain a life. But then, he wasn't taking his life with him; he was leaving it behind. He slept for a few fitful hours, haunted not by dreams of failure, but by the bewildered, furious look on Markus's face—a look that said Klaus had broken a rule of the universe he hadn't even known existed. Before dawn, he was on the road, the taillights of his Audi carving a red slash through the pre-dawn gloom as he merged onto the A1 Autobahn, heading northeast. Cologne, with its twin spires holding up the dawn, shrank in his rearview mirror until it was just a memory.

The journey was a six-hour meditation in motion. As he left the dense, industrial sprawl of North Rhine-Westphalia behind, the landscape flattened and opened up. The sky seemed to grow larger, the fields wider, the trees sparser. It felt like driving off the edge of his own detailed map into a vast, uncharted territory. He kept the radio off, letting the hum of the engine and the rhythmic thump of the tires on the asphalt be his only soundtrack. He was driving towards a city he barely knew, towards a life he couldn't possibly imagine, fueled by a single email and a thirty-four-year-old ache. The fear, which he had kept successfully at bay, began to creep in around the edges. It was a cold, rational fear, the kind his legal mind was an expert at cultivating. He had no job, no income beyond whatever pittance the show provided, and no plan beyond next week. He had traded a life of predictable, respectable misery for the infinitesimal chance of unpredictable joy. The sheer, glorious stupidity of it was breathtaking.

Berlin did not welcome him; it simply absorbed him. Unlike Cologne, which felt like a cohesive, ancient town huddled around its cathedral, Berlin was a sprawling, disjointed beast, a city of endless boulevards, concrete housing blocks, and startling pockets of vibrant, chaotic life. History was not a monument here; it was a scar, visible in the vacant lots and the jarring clash of architectural styles. He found the address from the email—a sleek, modern apartment hotel in Friedrichshain, a neighbourhood humming with a youthful energy that made him feel instantly ancient. The lobby was a cacophony of sound and colour. A group of teenagers, one with electric blue hair, were filming a TikTok dance near the elevators. Music with a bass line he could feel in his teeth pulsed from someone's phone. He saw her before she saw him: the girl from Mallorca, sitting cross-legged on a low-slung sofa, earnestly explaining the healing properties of a large amethyst geode to a bored-looking boy with a guitar case covered in stickers.

He checked in at the reception, the young woman behind the desk barely glancing up from her screen as she handed him a key card. "Klaus Richter? You're in 4B. All the contestants are on the fourth and fifth floors. Welcome to the madhouse." She offered a practiced, insincere smile. He took the elevator up, the generic pop music playing through its speakers a jarring premonition of his new reality. Apartment 4B was clean, impersonal, and furnished with the kind of minimalist Scandinavian furniture that looked stylish but felt unforgiving. It had a small balcony overlooking a courtyard where more young people were laughing and smoking. He dropped his single suitcase on the floor. The sound echoed in the sterile room. This was his new home. A temporary box, identical to all the other temporary boxes, filled with people who were not his colleagues, not his family, but his rivals.

He was standing on the balcony, trying to get his bearings, when a voice from the adjacent balcony made him jump. "It's the lawyer!" A young man with a carefully sculpted quiff and a diamond stud in his ear leaned over the railing, a cigarette dangling from his lips. He looked no older than twenty. "Saw you in the lobby. You look lost, man." Klaus recognized him from the boot camp stage—a swaggering pop-R&B singer named Leon who moved with the pre-packaged confidence of someone who had been groomed for fame since birth. "Just arrived," Klaus said, his voice feeling rusty. "Trying to process… all this." Leon took a drag from his cigarette and blew a perfect smoke ring. "Yeah, it's a trip. They've got us bunking two to a flat. Your roomie's not here yet. Some chick from Hamburg. Word is she's a screamer." He winked. "So, you really a lawyer? Like, with a briefcase and everything?" The question was friendly enough, but the subtext was clear: *what on earth are you doing here?* Klaus looked out over the courtyard, at the swirling, laughing, vibrant chaos of his new life. "I was," he said, more to himself than to the boy. "I'm not anymore."Chapter 3

Leon stubbed out his cigarette on the railing, leaving a small black smudge on the pristine white paintwork. "Well, good luck, man. You're gonna need it. First full-cast call is tomorrow at eight a.m. sharp. Main studio. Don't be late. They're not billing by the hour here." He offered another cocky grin and disappeared back into his apartment, leaving Klaus alone with the unsettling Berlin night. The brief interaction had done nothing to ease his sense of dislocation; it had only sharpened it. He was a specimen here, an oddity. *The Boring Lawyer Who Can Actually Sing*. He could almost see the chyron under his face on the television screen. He retreated from the balcony, closing the glass door and shutting out the noise of the courtyard. The silence of his room was a thin, fragile shield. He sat on the edge of the unforgiving bed, his hands clasped between his knees, a posture he often adopted when listening to a particularly difficult client. The problem was, he was his own difficult client now, and he had no idea what advice to give.

He was startled from his reverie by the sound of a key card sliding into the door lock. It opened to reveal his roommate. She was not, as Leon had crudely suggested, a "screamer" in the rock-and-roll sense. She was tall and whip-thin, with a cascade of dark, curly hair tied back in a severe knot. She wore simple black leggings and a grey tank top that revealed the lean, defined muscles in her arms and back. She carried a single, battered duffel bag and a yoga mat under one arm. Her eyes, a startlingly pale green, scanned the room and then landed on Klaus, her expression unreadable. She looked about twenty-five, but carried herself with the weary discipline of a veteran. “You must be Klaus,” she said. Her voice was low and resonant, with a clean, precise accent from the north. “I’m Elara.”

She dropped her bag on the unoccupied bed without ceremony and began to methodically unpack, her movements economical and practiced. She laid out a small collection of neatly folded clothes, a well-worn book of Rilke’s poetry, and a formidable-looking array of throat lozenges, sprays, and herbal teas. She was creating her own small, ordered world within the chaos. Klaus, feeling the need to fill the silence, finally spoke. “Yes, Klaus Richter. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” The formal introduction sounded ridiculous as soon as it left his lips. Elara glanced at him, a flicker of something—amusement? pity?—in her pale eyes. “Richter. You’re the solicitor, right? The Tom Waits guy.” News traveled fast in this ecosystem. It was like a high-security prison, but with better lighting and more hairspray. “I was a solicitor,” he corrected, the words feeling more true each time he said them. “And yes, that was me.” She nodded, seemingly satisfied with that information. “Save your voice,” she said, her tone not unkind, but direct. “They’re going to work us to the bone starting tomorrow. They’ll want a big group number for the press launch on Wednesday. It’s always something cheesy and over-choreographed. They like to see who cracks first.”

Elara’s prediction proved chillingly accurate. The next morning, the twelve finalists were herded into a vast television studio that smelled of fresh paint and nervous sweat. It was a cavern of black-painted scaffolding, coiled cables, and blinding lights. Klaus felt a pang of his old life’s anxiety—the feeling of entering a courtroom for a major trial—but this was different. The stakes here felt both higher and utterly frivolous. He saw the other contestants clearly for the first time: the impossibly fresh-faced boyband, already moving and speaking as a single entity; the aforementioned Leon, already flirting with a makeup artist; the girl with the crystals from Mallorca, who was now burning a sage stick in the corner until a frantic production assistant stopped her. Klaus, in his dark jeans and a plain t-shirt, felt like a crow who had wandered into an aviary of exotic parrots.

A woman with a severe black bob and a headset strode into the center of the room, clapping her hands with a sound like a rifle shot. "Listen up, beautiful people!" Her voice was a blade, sharp and honed by years of commanding attention. "I am Sabine, your creative director. For the next three months, your bodies, your voices, and your stories belong to me. You are not just singers; you are products. And I am here to make you marketable." Her eyes, cold and assessing, swept across the group, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Klaus. "Our first live show is in ten days. Our press launch is in two. For that, you will be performing a group arrangement of 'Blinding Lights'. It will be dynamic. It will be energetic. It will be flawless. Or you will wish you had never been born. Dancers, show them." A team of lithe, impossibly athletic dancers emerged from the shadows and launched into a routine of such complex, high-energy synchronicity that Klaus felt his stomach plummet. It was all sharp turns, dramatic lunges, and fluid body rolls. It was everything his body was not designed to do.

The next few hours were a special kind of hell. The contestants were arranged in formation, and Klaus found himself sandwiched between a hyper-flexible teenage girl and one of the boyband members who seemed to absorb the choreography through osmosis. The music, a thunderous pop track he'd only vaguely heard on the radio, was relentless. "Five, six, seven, eight!" Sabine’s voice cut through the music. "Turn, slide, pop! Richter, what is that? Are you having a seizure or are you attempting to dance? It’s a body roll, not a legal motion to dismiss!" Laughter rippled through some of the younger contestants. A flush of hot, deep humiliation crept up Klaus’s neck, a feeling he hadn't experienced since he was a clumsy teenager in gym class. He was a man accustomed to respect, to being the smartest person in the room. Here, he was the dunce, the joke, the stiff old man who couldn't find the beat. His mind, so adept at navigating the intricate clauses of a contract, could not seem to teach his body how to execute a simple spin without looking like a filing cabinet falling down a flight of stairs. He tried to follow the movements, to mimic the dancer in front of him, but his limbs felt like foreign objects, heavy and uncooperative. The more he concentrated, the worse it became, until he was simply shuffling in place, a monument to awkwardness in a sea of fluid motion. After another torturous hour, Sabine called for a water break. "Richter," she barked, beckoning him over with a crooked finger. "A word." He walked towards her, his t-shirt soaked with a cold sweat, feeling the eyes of the other eleven finalists on his back. This was not a courtroom. There was no protocol, no chance for rebuttal. He was simply walking toward his executioner.He stood before her, a pupil summoned to the headmistress's office, the scent of her sharp, floral perfume cutting through the stale studio air. Sabine didn’t look at him, her gaze fixed on a tablet in her hand, swiping through what he could only assume was footage of his own ineptitude. The silence stretched, a deliberate tool of intimidation he himself had often used in depositions. When she finally spoke, her voice was low and devoid of emotion, making the words land with the clinical precision of a scalpel. “You move like a man who has just been tasered. Your timing is a catastrophe. You possess the natural rhythm of a tectonic plate. In a group of twelve dancers, you are the one mistake the eye is drawn to every single time. You are a visual liability.” She looked up from her tablet, her eyes like chips of flint. “Explain to me why you are here.”

The question was not a request for his life story. It was a demand for justification, a challenge to his very presence. Klaus felt his throat tighten. The rehearsed lines he had used on Herr Adler, on Markus—about a lifelong dream, about needing a change—withered and died on his tongue. They were useless here. All he could manage was a raw, honest whisper. “To sing.” The two words sounded pathetic, insufficient, a child’s plea in a den of wolves. He braced himself for the dismissal, the curt command to pack his bags. Sabine held his gaze for a long moment, her expression unreadable. He could see the gears turning behind her eyes, the cold calculation of a master strategist. She was not looking at a person; she was analyzing an asset, weighing its strengths and weaknesses on a ruthless scale.

Then, she did something he didn't expect. She took a step closer, her voice dropping even further, forcing him to lean in. “Good. That’s the only correct answer. So stop trying to be a dancer. It’s pathetic to watch.” The words were brutal, but the strategic intent behind them began to dawn on him. “Did you really think we chose you because of your potential for pop choreography? We have a dozen kids who can do that in their sleep. We chose you for the contrast. The story. The stiff, buttoned-up solicitor with the voice of a fallen angel. Your awkwardness is not your weakness, Richter. It is your brand.” She tapped a perfectly manicured finger on his chest, right over his heart. “When the music starts, they need to see *you*—the lawyer. They need to see a man who looks like he belongs in a tax audit, not on a stage. They need to be thinking, ‘What is this poor man doing here?’ So that when you open your mouth and that voice comes out, it’s not a performance. It’s a revelation.”

She turned on her heel and gestured to one of the cowering production assistants. “Get him out of the main formation. When the others do the big roll on the chorus, he will be downstage, static. He doesn’t move. He just stands there, like a goddamn monument. He is the anchor. The rest of them are just the storm swirling around him. Let the children dance. You, Richter,” she said, turning back to him, her eyes narrowed, “you are going to sing.” With that, she clapped her hands again, the sound echoing through the now silent studio. “Break’s over! From the top! Let’s see some magic, people!” As the thunderous pop music crashed back to life, Klaus walked slowly to his new position at the front of the stage. The other contestants parted for him, their expressions a mixture of awe, confusion, and nascent jealousy. He was no longer one of them, a fumbling member of the pack. He was something else, set apart. He caught Elara’s eye. She was standing in the back row, her face impassive, but as he passed, she gave him a short, sharp nod, a gesture of understanding between two people who grasped the nature of the game. He wasn't being punished; he was being positioned. The humiliation he had felt moments before was replaced by something else, something cold and clear and powerful. He had escaped the black and white of the law only to find himself in a world with its own ruthless, unwritten code. And for the first time, he felt he might actually have a chance of winning.The rest of the rehearsal passed in a surreal haze. As the music blared, Klaus stood at his designated spot, a still point in a dizzying vortex of youthful energy. He watched the other eleven contestants spin and slide, their bodies forming intricate, fleeting patterns under the harsh studio lights. He felt utterly exposed, yet strangely insulated. He was no longer failing at their game; he was playing a different one entirely, on a board only he and Sabine seemed to see. The occasional resentful glare from Leon or a confused look from the boyband members only served to confirm his new, isolated status. He was the exception, the variable that had been deliberately introduced into the equation, and the knowledge was a suit of invisible armor. When Sabine finally called an end to the session, his legs ached from hours of just standing still, a testament to a tension far deeper than mere physical exertion.

Later that afternoon, they were shuffled into smaller practice rooms for their first individual vocal coaching sessions. Klaus entered a small, soundproofed room to find a portly man with a magnificent white beard and kind eyes, who introduced himself as Matteo. Unlike Sabine’s razor-wire energy, Matteo radiated a gentle, paternal warmth. He sat at a grand piano, his fingers resting on the keys as if they were old friends. He didn’t ask about Klaus’s story or his lack of rhythm; he simply played a C-major scale. “Sing for me, Klaus,” he said, his voice a soft baritone. Klaus, expecting another interrogation, was momentarily disarmed. He opened his mouth and followed the piano, his voice filling the small room. He moved through scales and arpeggios, Matteo leading him higher and higher, testing the edges of his range, the quality of his breath control. Finally, Matteo stopped and looked at him, his head tilted. “You have an old voice,” he said, not as a criticism, but as a diagnosis. “It has history in it. Pain. Like a cello that has been played for a hundred years. It is not a pop voice. It is a soul voice. Do not let them sand it down until it is smooth. The scratches are where the beauty is.” In that small, quiet room, away from the branding and the choreography, Klaus felt a flicker of pure joy. It was the simple, profound recognition of his craft by a master.

That evening, the apartment was a haven of shared exhaustion. Elara was on the floor, moving through a series of slow, deliberate yoga poses, her breathing a steady, soft rhythm in the quiet. Klaus sat in one of the hard, stylish chairs, nursing a bottle of water. For a long time, neither of them spoke. The silence wasn’t awkward; it was the comfortable quiet of two soldiers resting in a trench between battles. Finally, Elara unfolded herself from a complicated twist and looked at him, her pale green eyes seeming to see right through the day’s turmoil. “Sabine’s gambit,” she said, her voice low. “It’s a high-risk strategy. She’s betting the farm on your story. It makes you a target for the others, but it also makes you essential to her narrative. For now.” Klaus nodded, grateful for the unvarnished analysis. It was a language he understood far better than the vapid encouragement offered by the production assistants. “She breaks you down, finds your most interesting crack, and then fills it with gold,” Elara continued, toweling the sweat from her neck. “It’s her signature move. Just don’t let her make you forget that you are the one who has to sing the notes.”

The day of the press launch arrived with the manufactured urgency of a military operation. The backstage area was a hive of frantic activity, a blur of stylists with curling irons, makeup artists brandishing brushes like weapons, and runners speaking urgently into headsets. The air was thick with the chemical scent of hairspray and the collective anxiety of the twelve finalists. Klaus submitted to the process, sitting stoically as a young woman dabbed concealer under his eyes and tried, unsuccessfully, to tame a stubborn cowlick. He was dressed in a sharp, dark suit from the show’s wardrobe department—a more stylish, modern version of his old uniform. He was being packaged as ‘The Lawyer’, but sleeker, more mysterious. He saw his reflection and barely recognized the man looking back. He looked less like Klaus Richter, solicitor, and more like a character playing one in a moody television drama. When the call came to take their places, his heart began to hammer against his ribs, a frantic, primal drumbeat beneath the polished façade.

They were herded onto the stage, which was bathed in a brilliant, almost painful blue light. A hundred faces stared back at them from the gloom—journalists, bloggers, and photographers, their faces illuminated by the glow of their phone screens, their expressions ranging from bored to predatory. Then the music began, an explosive synth-pop crescendo that vibrated through the floor. The other eleven contestants burst into motion, a perfectly synchronized wave of energy and youthful glamour. Klaus stood his ground, downstage center, his hands loose at his sides. He felt the weight of every stare, the silent judgment, the palpable confusion. The verse began, a breathy duet between Leon and one of the other girls. Then came the pre-chorus, building tension, and he knew his line was next. The choreography swirled around him, a storm of limbs and hair, and for a single, terrifying second, the roar in his ears threatened to swallow his voice.

He took a breath, grounded himself, and sang. It was only one line, a short, melancholic bridge before the euphoric explosion of the main chorus: *“I’m just walking by to let you know…”* His voice, that cavernous, gravelly baritone that Matteo had called a ‘soul voice’, cut through the electronic sheen of the track like a searchlight through fog. For that one moment, the frantic energy of the performance froze. The dancing became background noise. The flashing lights seemed to dim. There was only his voice, raw and resonant and full of a longing that had nothing to do with the song’s lyrics and everything to do with the man singing them. A flicker of genuine surprise crossed the faces in the front row. A camera that had been trained on the dancers swiveled to focus on him. Then, just as quickly, the moment was over. The chorus hit, the dancers exploded back into the hook, and he was once again a statue in the storm. But something had changed. The equation had been solved. In the wings, he saw Sabine, a dark silhouette against the backstage chaos. She wasn’t looking at the dancers. She was looking at him, and she gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. It wasn't a gesture of praise. It was the curt acknowledgement of a successful transaction. He had delivered his part of the bargain. He was no longer just Klaus. He was an asset. And the first live show was only a week away.Chapter 4

The atmosphere back at the hotel was thick and charged, a low-pressure system of jealousy and ambition settling over the fourth and fifth floors. The press launch had redrawn the map of their small universe, and Klaus was now an unwilling sovereign of his own isolated island. The other contestants, who had previously treated him with a mixture of curiosity and pity, now regarded him with a wary respect that was laced with poison. He was no longer just the odd, older man; he was Sabine’s pet project, the strategic gambit, and that made him a threat. Leon passed him in the hallway, offering a smile that was all teeth. “Nice job out there, old man,” he said, his voice dripping with false camaraderie. “Guess you don’t need to dance when you’ve got the pity vote locked down.” The boyband members fell silent when he entered the communal lounge, their easy chatter resuming only after he had retrieved a bottle of water and retreated. He was a foreign object in their midst, and the body of the show was beginning to reject him.

His first solo strategy meeting took place the next day in a sterile conference room with Sabine and Matteo. It felt unnervingly like a legal consultation, only the subject was his own soul. Sabine, predictably, wanted to double down on the brand. "We need something heartbreaking," she declared, pacing the room. "Something that makes every middle-aged woman in Germany want to mother you and every young person see you as tragically authentic. I'm thinking Hallelujah." Klaus felt a wave of internal resistance. It was the obvious choice, a song so overdone on talent shows it had been stripped of all its sanctity. It was a karaoke standard for people with pretensions of depth. Matteo, sensing Klaus’s hesitation, gently intervened. “The song is a masterpiece, but it is also a very wide, public road. Klaus’s voice is a hidden path in the forest. We need a song that only he can show us.” Klaus, feeling a surge of courage from the vocal coach’s support, cleared his throat. “I have an idea,” he said, his voice steadier than he felt. “König von Deutschland by Rio Reiser.” Sabine scoffed. “Too political, too ironic. They won’t get it.” “Then Junimond,” Klaus pressed on, the name of the song feeling like a secret password from his past. “It’s about loss. About holding onto a feeling long after it’s gone. It’s a German song, for a German audience. It has history.” Matteo’s eyes lit up, and he began to hum the mournful melody, his fingers playing the chords on the polished surface of the table. Sabine stopped pacing. She stared at Klaus, her strategist’s mind whirring. A German classic, one that would resonate deeply with a certain demographic while being introduced as a piece of profound, moody art to another. It was unexpected. It was authentic. It was, in its own way, perfect branding. “Fine,” she said, a slow, predatory smile spreading across her face. “But you will bleed for them when you sing it. Every note must be a scar.”

Rehearsals for his solo performance were a meticulous, agonizing process of emotional excavation. There was no band, no backing track, just Klaus on a darkened stage with a single microphone stand and Matteo accompanying him on a grand piano. Sabine directed from the shadows of the empty auditorium, her voice a disembodied instrument of critique. “Don’t clutch the microphone stand like it’s a life raft, Richter. You are not drowning. You are the captain of a sinking ship. There is a difference. It’s called dignity.” He sang the song again and again, each time being stopped and corrected. “Your eyes. You looked at the floor on the last note of the chorus. The pain is not on the floor. It is behind your eyes. Let the camera see it.” “Breathe. I can hear you preparing for the high note. It must sound like it is tearing itself from your lungs without your permission.” It was grueling, invasive work. She was not just directing a singer; she was choreographing his heartbreak, demanding he access a deep well of sorrow from his grey, ordered life and display it for millions. Yet, with each repetition, the song became more his own. The stage became his sanctuary. The notes became the only language that mattered. He was no longer Klaus Richter, the imposter. He was the man who sang Junimond.

Two nights before the live show, as he was lying on his bed trying to read Rilke on Elara's recommendation and failing to quiet the frantic butterflies in his stomach, his phone buzzed with a number he knew by heart. It was Markus. His first instinct was to reject the call, to preserve the fragile peace of his new world from the judgment of the old. But he answered, a kind of morbid curiosity winning out. “Klaus,” his brother’s voice was hesitant, stripped of its usual breezy confidence. There was a pause. “I, uh… Anja found a clip online. From that press event you did.” Klaus waited, saying nothing. “You know,” Markus continued, stumbling over the words, “that one line you sang. It was… I don’t know. It was good, Klaus. It was really good.” The compliment landed with the force of a physical shock. It was a clumsy, unadorned admission, stripped of all irony and condescension. It was the most honest thing his brother had said to him in a decade. “Thanks,” Klaus managed, his throat suddenly tight. “So, this live show,” Markus asked, a note of genuine, almost childlike curiosity in his voice. “What will you be singing? Is it a secret?” The power dynamic had inverted so completely it was dizzying. Markus, the architect of a perfect life, was now the outsider, peering into the chaotic, brilliant world Klaus now inhabited. “You’ll have to watch, brother,” Klaus said, and for the first time, a small, genuine smile touched his lips. “Just like everyone else.”

The night before the first live show, a palpable terror settled over the hotel. The nervous energy had curdled into something close to panic. The boyband was having a whispered, frantic argument. Leon was nowhere to be seen. Klaus found himself on the building's rooftop terrace, a concrete slab that offered a breathtaking, panoramic view of Berlin's glittering expanse. The city lights spread out below like a fallen constellation. He was not alone. Elara stood by the railing, a slender silhouette against the skyline, perfectly still. "Can't sleep?" she asked without turning around. "I feel like my insides are trying to escape through my throat," he confessed, coming to stand beside her. The air was cold, but the fear burning inside him was hot. This was it. The culmination of it all. Tomorrow, there would be no more rehearsals, no more edits. Just him, a microphone, and millions of people. Elara finally turned to look at him, her pale eyes reflecting the city lights. "The first time I sang in a major final, I was sixteen. I threw up twice behind the curtain. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the mic," she said, her voice a low murmur. "Then they called my name, the lights came up, and I sang. Best I'd ever sung in my life." She offered him a rare, fleeting smile. "The fear isn't the enemy, Klaus. It’s the fuel. It tells you that you're alive and that this matters. Tomorrow, don't fight it. Use it. Let them see what it costs you." They stood in silence for a while longer, two solitary figures sharing a moment of quiet communion before the war. The city below hummed with a million lives, a million stories, and for the first time, Klaus Richter felt like his was about to truly begin.The atmosphere back at the hotel was thick and charged, a low-pressure system of jealousy and ambition settling over the fourth and fifth floors.

The day of the live show did not dawn; it ambushed. There was no gentle transition from the rooftop’s quiet epiphany to the morning’s frantic reality. One moment Klaus was processing Elara’s words under the stars, the next he was jolted awake by the percussive sound of her yoga mat snapping shut as she finished her pre-dawn routine. The fear he had accepted as fuel the night before was now a volatile, high-octane slick in his veins. The hotel, a place of relative calm, had transformed into the backstage of a global summit where everyone was a head of state and a potential assassin. Hallways echoed with vocal warm-ups that sounded more like cries for help, and the air in the elevator was so thick with nervous tension and competing perfumes that Klaus found himself holding his breath. He saw the crystal girl in a corner of the lobby, desperately trying to charge a small quartz rock on a portable phone battery, her face a mask of frantic hope. The carefully constructed confidence of the other contestants had been sandblasted away overnight, revealing the raw, terrified ambition beneath.

The studio was a different beast altogether. The cavernous, empty space of rehearsals was now alive, breathing with a thousand unseen parts. A live audience, contained behind barriers, murmured and buzzed like a giant, expectant beehive. Technicians in black t-shirts scurried through the labyrinth of cables, speaking a clipped, urgent language of their own. Klaus was swept up in the current, passed from wardrobe to makeup to the sound-check station where a young man taped a microphone pack to his back with the impersonal efficiency of a surgeon. The suit he was given was simple and dark, almost funereal. It was a deliberate choice, a somber frame for the emotional portrait he was expected to paint. He found a quiet corner in the "green room," a communal holding pen where the contestants were meant to offer each other support while secretly praying for their rivals' demise. Elara was there, stretching her legs, a picture of calm focus. Leon was pacing back and forth, muttering to himself, his swagger replaced by a twitchy, manic energy. The camaraderie of the boot camp felt like a distant, naive dream. They were no longer a group; they were a ranked list waiting to happen.

Time became a fluid, meaningless concept. Minutes stretched into agonizing eternities, then snapped into seconds. One by one, the other acts were called. Klaus heard the roar of the crowd, the bombastic music, the effusive praise of the host, all of it muffled through the walls, a series of distant battles in a war he had yet to join. His own name, when it was finally called by a harried stage manager, felt like a summons from another world. “Klaus, you’re on deck.” The words hung in the air. This was it. The point of no return. He walked from the relative light of the green room down a long, dark corridor towards the stage entrance. The muffled sound of the audience grew louder with every step until it was a physical presence, a low, thrumming roar that vibrated through the soles of his shoes. Matteo was waiting for him in the wings, just beyond the curtain. The old man placed a heavy hand on Klaus’s shoulder, his kind eyes meeting Klaus's. He didn't offer any last-minute advice. He simply said, "Tell them the truth, Klaus."

The host announced his name, his voice booming through the sound system, followed by the pre-recorded video package. Klaus caught a glimpse of it on a monitor: B-roll footage of the Kölner Dom, a shot of his empty office chair, and his own voiceover talking about a life lived in grey. It was the neat, tidy narrative Sabine had crafted, the story of The Boring Lawyer Who Can Actually Sing. Then, the video ended, the stage lights dimmed, and the host said, "Here, with his own rendition of Rio Reiser's 'Junimond,' is Klaus Richter!" He took a deep breath, the scent of dust and dry ice filling his lungs, and walked into the light. The heat from the lamps was immediate and intense, a physical weight. The faces of the audience were a blur, a vast, dark ocean dotted with the constellations of a thousand phone screens. The world shrank to a circle of brilliant white light containing him, a single microphone stand, and the gleaming black shape of Matteo’s grand piano. For a paralyzing second, his mind was a white wall of pure, crystalline fear. He could hear nothing but the frantic hammering of his own heart. He clutched the microphone stand, his knuckles white. *Don't clutch it like a life raft.* Sabine’s voice echoed in his memory. He forced his hand to relax. He looked out into the darkness, found a single red light on a camera, and held its gaze.

Matteo played the first mournful, iconic chords. The sound, so familiar from rehearsals, was a lifeline. Klaus brought the microphone to his lips, the cool metal a grounding touch. He sang the first line, his voice a low, hesitant tremor, a sound of almost unbearable vulnerability. He wasn’t performing; he was confessing. *“Es ist vorbei, bye-bye, Junimond…”* It’s over, bye-bye, June moon. The words were about a lost love, but he sang them to the man he had been, to the life he had immolated. He sang of the quiet desperation of his office, the taste of stale coffee, the weight of his father's name. As the chorus arrived, his voice swelled, the carefully managed tremor breaking into a raw, powerful cry, channeling every ounce of the fear and hope that had brought him to this point. The pain was not manufactured; it was the distilled truth of thirty-four years of quiet frustration, uncorked and poured out under the glare of a million lights. In the final, soaring note, he let go completely. It was the high C he had imagined in his office, the one that burned his lungs and dissolved the world. He held it until there was nothing left, letting it crack with the sheer force of the emotion, a sound of beautiful, ragged imperfection. Then, silence.

The silence that followed was absolute, a vast, breathless vacuum that seemed to stretch for an eternity. It was more terrifying than the performance itself. He stood, chest heaving, head bowed, waiting for the gavel to fall. And then it broke. It wasn't just applause; it was a roar, a wave of sound that rose from the audience and crashed over him, a visceral, cathartic release. It was a sound of shock, of recognition, of shared humanity. He looked up and saw people on their feet, their faces no longer a blur but individual expressions of astonishment and emotion. He saw a woman in the third row openly weeping. The judges were standing, their faces a mixture of awe and disbelief. When the applause finally subsided, the lead judge, a notoriously cynical rock producer, shook his head, his voice hoarse. "I… I have been doing this for twenty years," he said, staring at Klaus. "And I have never, ever seen anything like that. That was not a song. That was a testimony." The other judges echoed the sentiment, using words like ‘truth,’ ‘courage,’ and ‘devastating.’ Klaus just stood there, unable to process the praise, feeling utterly hollowed out, as if he had given away a piece of his own soul and was now waiting to see if it would be returned. As he walked off the stage, his legs unsteady, he passed Elara waiting in the wings for her turn. She didn't say a word. She simply reached out and squeezed his arm, a firm, grounding pressure that said everything. He had survived. He had bled, just as Sabine had demanded. And the whole of Germany had watched.The walk back to the green room was like swimming through molasses. The roar of the audience faded behind him, replaced by the humming of the studio’s vast electrical nervous system. His own body was a foreign country; his hands trembled not with fear, but with the aftershocks of an immense expenditure of energy. He felt hollowed out, scoured clean, as if the song had taken not just his breath but his memories, his regrets, his very substance, and broadcast them into the ether. He collapsed onto a vacant sofa in the holding area, oblivious to the other contestants who were now giving him a wide, unnerved berth. He was radioactive, a walking embodiment of a standard they now had to meet.

The air in the room had changed. The competitive tension was still there, but it was now laced with something new: genuine fear. Leon, who had performed an energetic but ultimately forgettable pop number, was staring at the floor, his usual cocky posture deflated. The members of the boyband were huddled together, whispering, their identical, styled heads close, like a flock of nervous birds. When Elara returned from her own performance—a technically flawless and powerfully sung ballad that earned her a respectful, but not rapturous, response—she sat not next to him, but on a chair opposite. She met his gaze and gave a single, clinical nod. It wasn't praise. It was an acknowledgement of a tactical nuclear strike. Klaus had not just performed well; he had broken the unspoken rules of the game, transforming a singing competition into a public confessional, and in doing so, had made everyone else’s polished efforts look like children’s theatre.

The hour leading up to the results was a unique form of torture. All eleven remaining acts were herded back onto the main stage, arranged in a line under the hot, unforgiving lights. The host, a man with teeth so white they seemed to generate their own power, chattered away, building manufactured suspense. Klaus stood between a nervous teenage girl and Leon, who refused to make eye contact. He felt strangely serene, detached from the proceedings. He had done what he came to do. The outcome felt secondary, a contractual obligation he had to see through. The host began to call the names of those who were safe. Leon’s name was called early, and a wave of visible relief washed over him, immediately replaced by his familiar smirk. Elara was called safe soon after. Then the host paused, a gleam in his eye. “The next act through to Week Two, after a performance that has all of Germany talking… is Klaus!” The camera zoomed in on his face, and he managed a tight, exhausted smile. He felt a brief flicker of relief, but it was immediately overshadowed by the grim reality of the process.

The lights dimmed, and two acts were left standing in the center of the stage: the girl with the crystals, whose name was Luna, and a bland but handsome acoustic guitarist. Luna’s performance had been a breathy, ethereal mess, her belief in her amethyst’s healing powers failing to correct her wavering pitch. Her face, as she stood there, was a heartbreaking picture of crumbling faith. When the host announced she was the one going home, a sob escaped her lips that was picked up by her microphone and broadcast to the nation. It was a raw, ugly sound of a dream dying. As she was given a consolatory hug, her eyes, wide with shock and glistening with tears, found Klaus’s. There was no malice in them, only a profound and childlike confusion, as if asking him how his magic had worked when hers had so utterly failed. The sight of her devastation was a cold slap, a reminder of the brutal zero-sum nature of this new world. For him to succeed, others had to fail.

The hotel was a morgue of ambition. The usual late-night chatter was gone, replaced by a heavy silence. In the elevator, a few of the contestants mumbled congratulations to Klaus, the words feeling forced and thin. Back in the sterile quiet of his apartment, the adrenaline finally deserted him, leaving behind an exhaustion so profound it was a physical ache. His suit felt like a lead weight. He peeled it off, dropping it in a heap on the floor—a stark contrast to the meticulous way he used to hang his solicitor’s suits—and sat on the edge of his bed in the near darkness. His phone, which he had left on the nightstand, had been buzzing intermittently all evening. He picked it up, his thumb hovering over the screen. He was terrified of what he might find, of the verdict of the outside world, the world he had so spectacularly abandoned.

The screen lit up with a blinding supernova of notifications. A cascade of messages, missed calls, and social media alerts, so numerous his thumb couldn't scroll through them fast enough. He saw snippets of texts from old university friends he hadn’t spoken to in years, a missed call from his mother, a friend request from Frau Schmidt at his old firm. His finger, acting with a will of its own, bypassed them all and went to the one conversation that mattered most. Markus. There was no text. Instead, there was a video file. His heart hammered against his ribs as he pressed play. His brother’s face appeared, poorly lit and shaky, filmed in his own glass-fronted living room. Markus looked pale, his eyes wide. He seemed at a complete loss, the architect stripped of his blueprints. "Klaus," he began, his voice thick, uncharacteristically hesitant. He swallowed, trying to compose himself. "Klaus, I… Anja and I, we just watched. I don't… I don't have the words." He ran a hand through his perfect hair, messing it up. "Dad," he said, the word catching in his throat. "Dad should have seen that. He would have been… he would have been so proud." The video ended abruptly.

Klaus stared at the black screen, the echo of his brother’s words reverberating in the silent room. He felt a profound, tectonic shift deep within him, a lifetime of resentment and misunderstanding cracking apart to reveal something tender and new beneath. It wasn't the roaring crowd or the judges' praise that broke him; it was that one sentence, that single, fragile admission from the person whose approval he had subconsciously craved and scorned his entire life. A single, hot tear traced a path down his cheek, the first he had shed since he’d embarked on this insane journey. It was a tear not of sorrow, but of a startling, painful, overwhelming release. He finally understood that he hadn't just been singing for himself. He had been singing for the boy who had been overshadowed, for the man who had felt invisible. And his brother, across hundreds of kilometers and a lifetime of distance, had finally, truly heard him.Chapter 6

The tear on his cheek had long since dried, leaving a faint, salty track on his skin, the only physical evidence of the seismic event that had occurred. Klaus woke slowly, not to the familiar jolt of anxiety, but to a profound and unnerving stillness. The frantic serpents in his stomach were gone, replaced by a strange, calm weight in the center of his chest. He lay in the pale Berlin morning light, listening to the distant city sounds, and felt the truth of it settle into his bones: the war with Markus, the silent, undeclared conflict that had defined so much of his adult life, was over. He had not won; they had simply laid down their arms. He picked up his phone from the nightstand. The screen was dark, the notifications silent. He re-watched the shaky, heartfelt video from his brother, and the words, “Dad would have been so proud,” landed with the same quiet, devastating force. He had spent years running from his father’s legacy, only to find that he had, in his own way, finally fulfilled it. It was a paradox so complete it bordered on peace.

When he finally left the apartment, the world of the hotel had re-calibrated around his new status. The change was immediate and palpable. In the corridor, he nearly collided with two members of the boyband, who jumped back as if he had an electric charge. They muttered a hasty “Sorry, Herr Richter,” their eyes fixed on the floor, their usual youthful arrogance replaced by a kind of fearful reverence. The 'Herr Richter' was new. It was a title from his old life, but it meant something entirely different here. It was no longer a signifier of a grey profession; it was a mark of formal, unapproachable power. He had become an adult in a room full of children, and it isolated him more effectively than any animosity ever could. Leon, leaning against the wall by the elevators, watched him approach with narrowed eyes. The sneer was still there, but it was brittle now. “Look who it is,” Leon said, his voice a low drawl. “The Voice of Germany’s Sadness. You gonna make us all cry again this week, or have you got another trick up your sleeve?” Klaus simply looked at him, his own exhaustion too deep to engage. “Good morning, Leon,” he said, his voice even, and stepped into the elevator, leaving the younger man flustered in the face of an enemy who refused to fight.

Later that morning, they were all gathered in the main studio for a debriefing. Sabine strode in, radiating a victor’s energy. She was dressed in a sharp, blood-red blazer, and a triumphant smile played on her lips. “Good morning, stars,” she began, her gaze sweeping across the room before landing, and staying, on Klaus. “As you know, we had an exceptional start to the live shows. Ratings were through the roof. The media is in a frenzy.” On the large screen behind her, a montage of headlines flashed up. *THE GERMAN JOHNNY CASH. THE SOUL OF A SOLICITOR. THE SURPRISE HIT OF THE SEASON.* Klaus’s face, captured in a moment of raw, onstage anguish, was everywhere. He felt a wave of vertigo, watching his private pain being packaged and sold as public entertainment. “The nation has fallen in love with a story,” Sabine continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. “Our story. But a good story needs twists. It needs new chapters. This week, we prove our range.” She clapped her hands, and the energy in the room shifted from celebratory to tense. The game was on again.

His private strategy meeting was held in the same sterile conference room, but the atmosphere was entirely different. Sabine was practically vibrating with excitement. “Klaus, my magnificent tragedian,” she greeted him, her smile a flash of brilliant white. “We didn’t just create a moment. We created a myth. People are talking about you in cafes, in offices, on trains. You are the man who reminded Germany it has a heart.” She began to pace, her red blazer a streak of motion against the grey walls. “So, for Week Two. We pivot. We have shown them the sorrow. Now, we show them the joy that was buried underneath. We need tempo. We need optimism. We need a song that says, ‘The man in grey is free!’ I’m thinking Pharrell Williams. ‘Happy’.” The song title landed in the silent room with the thud of a joke book dropped in a library. Klaus stared at her, a cold dread seeping into the calm he had felt that morning. It was not a suggestion. It was a command. He looked to Matteo, who sat at the table looking deeply uncomfortable, his fingers kneading each other.

“No,” Klaus said. The word was quiet but absolute. Sabine stopped pacing. Her smile did not falter, but her eyes went cold. “I’m sorry?” “I can’t sing that song,” Klaus elaborated, his voice gaining strength. “It’s not me. It would be a lie. The only reason ‘Junimond’ worked was because it was the truth.” “The truth?” Sabine laughed, a short, sharp, humourless sound. “The truth is what we create, Klaus. The narrative is that you were a man trapped in a colourless life. You have broken free. The audience needs to see the result of that freedom. They need to see you smile. They need to see you dance!” The word ‘dance’ was a deliberate jab, a reminder of his earlier humiliation. “My strength is my authenticity,” Klaus argued, his lawyerly instincts kicking in. “If I betray that, I have nothing. The audience will see right through it.” “The audience will see what I tell them to see!” Sabine shot back, her voice rising, the velvet glove finally coming off. “Do you want to be a one-hit wonder? The sad lawyer who sang the sad song and then disappeared? Or do you want to win this thing? To have a career? Because to do that, you have to be more than one note. You have to be an artist. And artists, Klaus, are versatile.”

He left the meeting without an agreement, a furious stalemate hanging in the air. He needed to walk, to escape the pressurized container of the studio. He slipped out a side exit and onto the busy Berlin street, pulling the collar of his jacket up against the wind. He kept his head down, but his new reality was inescapable. On a newsstand, he saw his own face staring back from the cover of a weekly tabloid. THE LONELY LAWYER’S SECRET HEARTBREAK! screamed the headline. A picture of him from the stage, face contorted in emotion, was juxtaposed with a grainy, long-lens shot of his empty office window in Cologne. They had commodified his pain with terrifying efficiency. He felt a surge of nausea and turned away, only to walk past a group of girls, one of whom gasped and pointed. “Look! It’s him! It’s the singer-lawyer!” A phone was raised, and a flash went off, a small, violent burst of light that made him flinch. He quickly crossed the street, his heart pounding, and hurried back toward the hotel. His freedom felt more like a prison than his old life ever had. The walls were just brighter, and everyone was watching.

Back in the apartment, Elara was sitting on the floor, methodically polishing the fretboard of her acoustic guitar with a soft cloth. The simple, domestic act was a stark contrast to the chaos of Klaus’s morning. She didn't look up as he came in and slumped into one of the unforgiving chairs. The silence stretched for a moment, filled only by the soft squeak of the cloth on the rosewood. “Let me guess,” she said finally, her voice calm and even. “She wants you to sing something happy.” Klaus let out a short, sharp sigh that was half laugh, half groan. “Pharrell.” Elara stopped polishing and looked at him, her pale green eyes unblinking. She plucked a single, mournful E-minor chord that seemed to sum up his entire predicament. “This is the second test,” she said, her voice dropping to the low, conspiratorial tone she reserved for dissecting the show’s machinations. “The first was to see if you would bleed for them. You passed with flying colours. This test is to see if you will dance for them.” She put the guitar down and leaned forward, her expression serious. “Be careful, Klaus. The moment they discover they can manufacture your joy, they will own all of you.”Chapter 6

Elara’s words hung in the sterile air of the apartment long after she had retreated into her own silent pre-sleep ritual. *The moment they discover they can manufacture your joy, they will own all of you.* It was a warning, but it felt more like a diagnosis of the illness he had just been exposed to. He had escaped the black and white of the law only to find himself in a more insidious trap, one painted in the bright, primary colours of manufactured emotion. This was the true nature of his new contract, he realized. He had not signed away his time or his labour; he had signed away the copyright to his own feelings. His sorrow was now a marketable asset, and they were already moving to diversify the portfolio into joy. It was a boundary dispute far more profound than any he had ever adjudicated, a fight for the sliver of land that separated the public persona from the private soul.

He spent a sleepless night staring at the ceiling, the relentless beat of Pharrell’s "Happy" a mocking, synthesized torture loop in his mind. He could picture it with horrifying clarity: him, on stage, in some brightly coloured suit, attempting a clumsy shuffle while a group of relentlessly cheerful dancers gyrated around him. The image was a grotesque parody of everything he had accomplished. It would not just be a lie; it would be a refutation, a public declaration that the man who sang "Junimond" was a fraud, a character played for one week only. The trust he had earned from the audience, the fragile connection he had forged through a moment of shared vulnerability, would be shattered. He would become the joke Leon already thought he was. The lawyer in him, the part of his mind that thrived on logic and strategy, kicked into gear. He could not simply refuse. A flat-out "no" was an act of mutiny, and Sabine would crush it without a second thought. He needed a counter-offer. He needed a different song.

The next morning, he skipped the communal breakfast and went straight to the small, soundproofed practice room that had become his only real refuge. He sat not at the piano, but on the floor, his back against the cool wall, and tried to think. He needed a song with tempo, a song that wasn't a dirge, but it had to have roots in something real. He scrolled through his phone, not through streaming services, but through the sparse collection of music he had purchased years ago, a digital fossil record of the man he had been before the law consumed him. He saw the familiar names—Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Leonard Cohen—his pantheon of glorious misery. But tucked among them were other artists, bands from his university days. German indie bands who wrote lyrics that were smart, cynical, and full of a restless, urban energy. He found a song by an artist named Clueso, a track called “Gewinner.” Winner. The irony was palpable. It wasn’t a happy song, not in the simple, saccharine way Sabine meant. Its melody was upbeat, driven by a restless, propulsive beat, but the lyrics were a meditation on change, on leaving things behind, on the strange, hollow feeling of victory. *“Du bist anders als die Anderen, und das ist gut so…”* You are different than the others, and that’s a good thing. It was a song about claiming your own strange path. It wasn't joy. It was defiance. It was perfect.

Armed with his proposal, he sought out his only potential ally. He found Matteo in his private coaching studio, the scent of old paper and lemon tea a welcome antidote to the hairspray-and-panic smell of the main complex. The vocal coach was making notes on a sheet of music, but he looked up as Klaus entered, his kind eyes clouded with concern. “Klaus. I heard about your meeting with Sabine. I am… sorry. She can be a force of nature.” Klaus closed the door behind him, the thick wood muffling the distant sounds of the show’s machinery. “She wants me to sing ‘Happy’,” he said, the words tasting like poison. Matteo winced, a motion of genuine artistic pain. “A fine pop song,” he said, with the tone of a man describing a well-made plastic chair. “But it is not your chair, Klaus.” It was the opening he needed. “I have another idea,” Klaus said, pulling out his phone. “A song called ‘Gewinner’ by Clueso. It has the tempo she wants. It's optimistic, in a way. But it’s real. It's a story I can tell.” He played the track, the driving rhythm and intelligent lyrics filling the small, quiet room. Matteo listened intently, his head tilted, his fingers tapping silently on the piano keys, tracing the chord changes. When the song finished, he was quiet for a long moment. “Yes,” he said finally, a slow smile spreading across his face, lighting up his eyes. “This is not the joy of a man who has won the lottery. This is the joy of a man who has broken out of prison.”

The second confrontation with Sabine was one Klaus requested himself. He walked into her office, a minimalist white box high above the studio floor, feeling not like a condemned man, but like a lawyer entering a negotiation with a prepared case. Sabine was on the phone, her back to him, looking out the panoramic window at the sprawling city. “No, the numbers are good, but I need them to be spectacular. Get it done,” she snapped, before ending the call and turning to face him, a single eyebrow arched in challenge. “Richter. I was told you had something for me. I hope it’s a video of you practicing your dance moves.” Klaus ignored the jibe. He remained standing, placing his phone on the corner of her vast white desk. “I have a counter-proposal,” he said, his voice calm and measured. “It gives you the tempo and the narrative shift you want, but it preserves the one thing that makes my story work: the truth.” She crossed her arms, a glint of amusement in her eyes. “I’m listening.” He played the song for her. He watched her face, a mask of cold professionalism, looking for any crack, any flicker of response. The song’s propulsive energy filled the office. When it ended, she was silent. He pressed his advantage. “The narrative isn’t ‘The sad man is now happy’,” he argued, using her own vocabulary. “It’s ‘The quiet man has found his voice, and it is louder than you thought.’ It’s about being a winner on your own terms. It’s a more complex story. A better story. ‘Happy’ is a headline. ‘Gewinner’ is a feature article.” He had laid his case out, made his closing argument. The verdict was now hers to deliver. Sabine stared at him, then at the phone, then back at him. She walked to the window, her silhouette a sharp, intimidating figure against the bright sky. The silence stretched, thick with unspoken power. “Fine,” she said, without turning around. “You get your song.” Then she turned, and the smile she gave him was sharp and dangerous. “But you had better make them feel like they are winning right along with you. And Richter,” she added, her voice dropping to a low, chilling purr, “you will move. I don't want a body roll. I don't want a spin. But you will not stand there like a statue. This song has a pulse. You will find it, or I will find it for you.”Chapter 7

The victory over the song choice was a fleeting, hollow thing. Klaus had won the battle, but Sabine, with her final, chilling command, had redefined the terms of the war. It was no longer about the sound he made, but the space he occupied. The demand that he *move* was a far more intimate and terrifying invasion than being told what to sing. His stillness had been his armour, the last vestige of the reserved, contemplative solicitor. To surrender it felt like standing naked in the town square. Rehearsals for “Gewinner” began in a tense, charged atmosphere. The band, a tight, professional unit of session musicians, launched into the song’s driving, indie-rock rhythm. Klaus stood at the microphone, gripped it with both hands as if to anchor himself against the music's pull, and sang. His voice was strong, imbued with the song’s defiant spirit, but his body was a pillar of resistance, a statue of a man pretending to be a rock star. He hadn’t even made it to the first chorus before Sabine’s voice, amplified by the studio’s talkback system, cut through the music like a shard of glass. "Stop! Music off! What in God's name was that?"

The musicians fell silent. Klaus stood blinking in the sudden quiet, the phantom beat still throbbing in his ears. Sabine emerged from the darkness of the auditorium and strode onto the stage, her high-heeled boots making sharp, angry sounds on the wooden boards. She dismissed the band and Matteo with a flick of her wrist. "Everyone out. Just me and the monument." When they were alone in the vast, empty space, she circled him like a predator sizing up its prey. "You sing of being a winner, Richter, but you stand there like a man awaiting sentencing. You look like you're bracing for a blow. You are not a victim in this song. You are the victor." She stopped directly in front of him, her face inches from his. "So, we are going to walk. You are going to sing, and you are going to walk. From that side of the stage to this one. Go." He stared at her, dumbfounded. "Just… walk?" "It's a start," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "I have faith that a man of your advanced years has mastered the art of bipedal locomotion. Now, sing."

What followed was the most humiliating hour of his life, a period of sustained awkwardness that made the dance rehearsal feel like a pleasant memory. He began to walk, his steps stiff and self-conscious, while trying to sing. His breath control, usually so precise, deserted him. His voice came out in thin, strangled bursts as he focused on the simple, impossible act of putting one foot in front of the other without looking like a malfunctioning automaton. He felt like a child learning to ride a bicycle, every instinct screaming that he was about to fall. Sabine was relentless, a merciless drill sergeant of stage presence. "Your hands, Richter! They're glued to your sides! Do you walk down the street like that? Do you hold them like two dead fish when you're making a point? Use them!" He tried to gesture, but his movements were stiff, unnatural, a parody of a politician on a soapbox. The more he tried, the more he thought, and the more he thought, the more disconnected he became from the music, from his own body. He was a brain in a jar, piloting a machine it did not understand.

After another failed attempt, where he nearly tripped over a cable, he stopped in the middle of the stage, breathing heavily, drenched in a cold sweat of pure frustration. "I can't," he gasped, the words tasting of defeat. "I cannot do this. It’s not me. I’m a singer, not… this." Sabine crossed her arms, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes. It wasn’t anger. It was the look of a scientist observing a predictable chemical reaction. "You won, Richter," she said, her voice deceptively calm. "You came into my office, you made your case, and you won. You beat me. You got your song. Does a winner stand still, waiting for someone to hand him a trophy? Or does he stride across the territory he has just conquered and claim it as his own? This stage is not your enemy. It is the spoils of your victory. Right now, you are treating it like it's hostile ground." She pointed a single, sharp finger at him. "Your problem isn't your body. It's your mind. You still think you're the solicitor from Cologne who has no business being here. You are refusing to accept that you belong in this space. Until you do, you will remain a prisoner in your own skin."

That night, he paced the small confines of his hotel room like a caged animal. The apartment felt impossibly small, the walls closing in. He was venting his frustration in a low, furious murmur, recounting the day’s humiliations, when Elara, who had been sitting cross-legged on her bed, quietly spoke. "You're doing it right now." Klaus stopped pacing and stared at her. "Doing what?" he snapped, his patience worn thin. "Moving," she said, her voice a calm anchor in his storm. "You're not dancing. You're not performing. You're holding court. You're working through a problem, and your body is moving with your thoughts. Your hands aren't dead fish; you just used them to make three distinct points about Sabine’s parentage." He looked down at his own hands, one of them half-clenched in a fist, and a jolt of understanding shot through him. Elara continued, her gaze direct and insightful. "Stop thinking of the stage as a dance floor. It's not. It's your courtroom. The audience is your jury. And with this song, you're not asking them for a verdict. You are presenting your closing argument. You are telling them how it is. You don't need choreography. You just need to own the space while you make your case."

He returned to the studio the next day with a new, fragile sense of purpose. Elara’s words had provided him with the one thing he desperately needed: a logical framework, a bridge from the world he knew to the one he was trying to inhabit. When the band started playing, he did not grip the microphone stand. He took a breath, stepped away from it, and as he began to sing, he began to walk. It wasn't a dancer's glide; it was a solicitor's stride, the confident, measured pace of a man moving across a courtroom, a man in complete command of his argument. He didn't plan his movements. He let his body follow the energy of the song and the cadence of his own thoughts. He walked to the edge of the stage, not to engage the imaginary audience, but as if to press a point, his hands making small, sharp gestures to punctuate the lyrics. He was not performing movement; the movement was a byproduct of his performance. It was authentic. It was him. From the darkness of the auditorium, he could see two silhouettes. Matteo was standing, his hands clasped, a look of profound relief on his face. Beside him, Sabine was perfectly still, but even from that distance, Klaus could feel the intensity of her focus, the cold, satisfying click of a strategist watching her complex machinery finally fall into place.

The final dress rehearsal was a revelation. The stage was fully lit, the sound was deafening, and the imaginary audience felt real. When his turn came, Klaus walked out with a new sense of ownership. He was no longer a visitor. This was his territory. As the band kicked into "Gewinner," he moved with a restless, liberated energy. He strode the length of the stage, sang directly into the main camera with a defiant glare, and used the microphone stand not as a crutch, but as a prop, a temporary anchor he could push away from. The performance was not about polished joy; it was about the messy, exhilarating, and slightly aggressive energy of a man breaking his own chains. He ended the song not at the center mark, but at the far corner of the stage, his chest heaving, a thin, triumphant smile on his face as the final chord rang out into the empty arena. He had not learned to dance. He had learned to move like a free man. He had found the song’s pulse by finally synchronizing it with his own.The victory over the song choice was a fleeting, hollow thing.

When they were alone in the vast, empty space, she circled him like a predator sizing up its prey. "You sing of being a winner, Richter, but you stand there like a man awaiting sentencing. You look like you're bracing for a blow. You are not a victim in this song. You are the victor." She stopped directly in front of him, her face inches from his. "So, we are going to walk. You are going to sing, and you are going to walk. From that side of the stage to this one. Go." He stared at her, dumbfounded. "Just… walk?" "It's a start," she said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "I have faith that a man of your advanced years has mastered the art of bipedal locomotion. Now, sing."

What followed was the most humiliating hour of his life, a period of sustained awkwardness that made the dance rehearsal feel like a pleasant memory. He began to walk, his steps stiff and self-conscious, while trying to sing. His breath control, usually so precise, deserted him. His voice came out in thin, strangled bursts as he focused on the simple, impossible act of putting one foot in front of the other without looking like a malfunctioning automaton. He felt like a child learning to ride a bicycle, every instinct screaming that he was about to fall. Sabine was relentless, a merciless drill sergeant of stage presence. "Your hands, Richter! They're glued to your sides! Do you walk down the street like that? Do you hold them like two dead fish when you're making a point? Use them!" He tried to gesture, but his movements were stiff, unnatural, a parody of a politician on a soapbox. The more he tried, the more he thought, and the more he thought, the more disconnected he became from the music, from his own body. He was a brain in a jar, piloting a machine it did not understand.

After another failed attempt, where he nearly tripped over a cable, he stopped in the middle of the stage, breathing heavily, drenched in a cold sweat of pure frustration. "I can't," he gasped, the words tasting of defeat. "I cannot do this. It’s not me. I’m a singer, not… this." Sabine crossed her arms, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes. It wasn’t anger. It was the look of a scientist observing a predictable chemical reaction. "You won, Richter," she said, her voice deceptively calm. "You came into my office, you made your case, and you won. You beat me. You got your song. Does a winner stand still, waiting for someone to hand him a trophy? Or does he stride across the territory he has just conquered and claim it as his own? This stage is not your enemy. It is the spoils of your victory. Right now, you are treating it like it's hostile ground." She pointed a single, sharp finger at him. "Your problem isn't your body. It's your mind. You still think you're the solicitor from Cologne who has no business being here. You are refusing to accept that you belong in this space. Until you do, you will remain a prisoner in your own skin."

That night, he paced the small confines of his hotel room like a caged animal. The apartment felt impossibly small, the walls closing in. He was venting his frustration in a low, furious murmur, recounting the day’s humiliations, when Elara, who had been sitting cross-legged on her bed, quietly spoke. "You're doing it right now." Klaus stopped pacing and stared at her. "Doing what?" he snapped, his patience worn thin. "Moving," she said, her voice a calm anchor in his storm. "You're not dancing. You're not performing. You're holding court. You're working through a problem, and your body is moving with your thoughts. Your hands aren't dead fish; you just used them to make three distinct points about Sabine’s parentage." He looked down at his own hands, one of them half-clenched in a fist, and a jolt of understanding shot through him. Elara continued, her gaze direct and insightful. "Stop thinking of the stage as a dance floor. It's not. It's your courtroom. The audience is your jury. And with this song, you're not asking them for a verdict. You are presenting your closing argument. You are telling them how it is. You don't need choreography. You just need to own the space while you make your case."

He returned to the studio the next day with a new, fragile sense of purpose. Elara’s words had provided him with the one thing he desperately needed: a logical framework, a bridge from the world he knew to the one he was trying to inhabit. When the band started playing, he did not grip the microphone stand. He took a breath, stepped away from it, and as he began to sing, he began to walk. It wasn't a dancer's glide; it was a solicitor's stride, the confident, measured pace of a man moving across a courtroom, a man in complete command of his argument. He didn't plan his movements. He let his body follow the energy of the song and the cadence of his own thoughts. He walked to the edge of the stage, not to engage the imaginary audience, but as if to press a point, his hands making small, sharp gestures to punctuate the lyrics. He was not performing movement; the movement was a byproduct of his performance. It was authentic. It was him. From the darkness of the auditorium, he could see two silhouettes. Matteo was standing, his hands clasped, a look of profound relief on his face. Beside him, Sabine was perfectly still, but even from that distance, Klaus could feel the intensity of her focus, the cold, satisfying click of a strategist watching her complex machinery finally fall into place.

The final dress rehearsal was a revelation. The stage was fully lit, the sound was deafening, and the imaginary audience felt real. When his turn came, Klaus walked out with a new sense of ownership. He was no longer a visitor. This was his territory. As the band kicked into "Gewinner," he moved with a restless, liberated energy. He strode the length of the stage, sang directly into the main camera with a defiant glare, and used the microphone stand not as a crutch, but as a prop, a temporary anchor he could push away from. The performance was not about polished joy; it was about the messy, exhilarating, and slightly aggressive energy of a man breaking his own chains. He ended the song not at the center mark, but at the far corner of the stage, his chest heaving, a thin, triumphant smile on his face as the final chord rang out into the empty arena. He had not learned to dance. He had learned to move like a free man. He had found the song’s pulse by finally synchronizing it with his own.Chapter 8

The air before the second live show was not thick with terror, but with a sharp, professional tension. The wide-eyed panic of the first week had been replaced by the grim focus of seasoned gladiators preparing for another round in the arena. The weak had been culled, and the remaining contestants now carried themselves with the wary posture of survivors. They understood the rules, the stakes, and the unforgiving nature of the public vote. Klaus, who had been the object of pity and curiosity a week ago, was now the axis around which the entire show seemed to turn. He was no longer the oddity; he was the benchmark, a walking, breathing embodiment of the standard they all had to meet, and his presence in the green room was a silent, suffocating pressure. He felt their eyes on him even when they weren't looking, a constant, low-level hum of resentment, calculation, and fear.

Waiting in the wings, the familiar scent of dry ice and electricity filled his lungs, but the fear that had once paralyzed him was gone, replaced by a restless, kinetic energy. Elara was due on just before him, and as she passed him on her way to the stage, she paused. She was performing a fierce, technically demanding rock anthem, and her usual calm had been replaced by a focused fire. "Don't just make your case tonight, Herr Richter," she murmured, her voice a low growl, a rare smile touching the corner of her lips. "Burn the whole courthouse down." The words were a shot of pure adrenaline. He watched her walk into the light, and for the first time, he felt not like a competitor, but like a co-conspirator. He was next. As the host began his introduction, recapping the “sensational debut of the singing solicitor,” Klaus saw Sabine standing by the monitor. She caught his eye, her expression unreadable, and simply tapped her foot twice on the floor, a sharp, impatient rhythm. It was not a word of encouragement. It was a command to remember the pulse.

The stage was his. The opening chords of "Gewinner" erupted from the band, a driving, insistent beat that was the polar opposite of the mournful piano that had introduced him a week before. He stepped away from the microphone stand, leaving it behind like a shed skin, and walked into the center of the stage, the light finding him not as a static figure, but as a man already in motion. He sang the first line, not with the hesitant vulnerability of "Junimond," but with a clear, challenging confidence. His voice, stripped of its gravelly sorrow, was sharp and resonant, cutting through the mix with an urgent clarity. He began to move, not with the practiced grace of a dancer, but with the restless, purposeful energy of a man on a mission. He strode from one side of the stage to the other, his path deliberate, his gaze fixed on the main camera lens as if it were the eye of a hostile witness he was determined to break down.

During the song's instrumental break, he did not stand still. He turned his back to the audience, a move of audacious confidence, and faced the drummer, his body vibrating with the percussive force, a man fully immersed in the storm of his own creation. When he turned back for the final chorus, a raw, triumphant smile broke across his face, a completely unplanned and genuine expression of pure, unadulterated release. It wasn't the manufactured joy Sabine had wanted; it was the defiant, slightly unhinged grin of a man who had forgotten he was being watched, a man who had finally, completely, arrived in his own skin. He delivered the final lines, *“Du bist anders als die Anderen, und das ist gut so,”* not as a lament, but as a roaring declaration of self, a closing argument that left no room for rebuttal. The final chord crashed, and he stood, breathing heavily, his hands on his hips, surveying the roaring, standing-room-only crowd not as a jury, but as his conquered territory.

The response was not the shocked, tearful silence of the previous week. It was a wall of pure, adrenalized sound, a roar of collective energy. The audience wasn't just applauding; they were on their feet, clapping along to a phantom beat, their faces alight with the infectious energy he had unleashed. The cynical lead judge was laughing, a sound of pure delight. "I genuinely thought you were a fluke, Richter," he shouted over the din, shaking his head in disbelief. "I thought you were a one-song tragedy. What you just did… that was not a performance. That was a jailbreak, and you took all of us with you. You, sir, are a rock star." The other judges were equally effusive, praising his versatility, his courage, and his electrifying stage presence. They were no longer talking about his backstory; they were talking about his artistry.

Backstage, the atmosphere was electric. Matteo grabbed him in a bear hug that lifted him off the floor, his face beaming with a pride so fierce it was almost paternal. "You moved, Klaus! You moved like a free man!" Sabine appeared at his side, her face a mask of cool satisfaction. "A bit ragged on the edges, Richter," she said, her voice low. "But effective. Very effective." It was the highest form of praise he knew he would ever receive from her. He had not just followed her orders; he had translated them into his own language and, in doing so, had exceeded her expectations. He had proven he was not just a malleable asset but a creative partner in his own myth-making, which made him infinitely more valuable and far more dangerous. As the results were announced later that night, there was no real suspense. His name was called first, the vote so decisive it was a coronation. The act sent home was the blandly handsome acoustic guitarist, another casualty in Klaus’s unintentional but relentless march to the final. As he stood on the stage, taking his place with the other survivors, he saw Leon staring at him from across the line, his face a toxic cocktail of fury and disbelief. The game had changed again, and Klaus knew, with a certainty that was both thrilling and terrifying, that he was no longer just trying to survive. He was playing to win.The air before the second live show was not thick with terror, but with a sharp, professional tension.

The morning after the jailbreak, the atmosphere in the hotel had curdled. The silence was no longer thick with nervous tension; it was a thin, brittle thing, stretched taut over a chasm of resentment. When Klaus entered the breakfast room, the low chatter faltered and died. The boyband, huddled over bowls of muesli at a large communal table, looked up, and one of them nudged another. As if acting on a silent signal, they gathered their things and moved to a smaller table in the far corner, a deliberate, public act of ostracism. Klaus poured himself a coffee, his own hands steady, and felt the weight of their collective animosity as a physical pressure between his shoulder blades. He had not just beaten them; he had rendered them irrelevant, and they would never forgive him for it. He was no longer the strange uncle at the family gathering; he was the invading monarch, and the court was in quiet, sullen revolt.

His newfound fame had also become a voracious, insatiable beast. The narrative he had so carefully crafted with Sabine was no longer his to control. It belonged to the public, and they were writing their own speculative, sensational chapters. During a mandatory press call that afternoon, a slick young journalist from a major tabloid held up a microphone and asked, her voice oozing with faux sympathy, "Klaus, Germany has seen your sorrow and your righteous anger. But the question everyone is asking is, has a man who lived in grey for so long ever had time for love?" The question was a perfectly aimed missile, designed to breach the last of his defenses. The room fell silent. The other contestants, standing behind him, leaned in, hungry for the answer. Klaus felt a flush of heat, the invasive nature of the query a violation far more personal than any legal cross-examination. He gave a non-committal answer, a practiced evasion from his old life, but the damage was done. The seed had been planted. The public now demanded to know about his heart.

Predictably, Sabine saw the journalist’s ambush not as a violation, but as a gift. In her stark white office, she was already storyboarding the week. "She served it to us on a silver platter, Klaus," she said, her eyes gleaming with predatory delight. "The public is primed. They are ready for the next chapter. This week's theme is 'Lieder der Liebe' - Love Songs." She smiled, anticipating his resistance. "And I know what you’re thinking. No, you will not be singing a power ballad. We are not in the business of clichés this season. We have established you as an artist of substance. Your love song must reflect that." She paused for dramatic effect, letting the tension build. "It must be a song of dangerous desire. Of obsession. Of a love so powerful it borders on madness." Klaus watched her, his mind already working, no longer a pawn but a chess player considering his next move. He had spent the previous night anticipating this very conversation, preparing his case. "Chris Isaak," Klaus said, his voice calm, cutting her off before she could make her own suggestion. "Wicked Game."

Sabine stopped, momentarily thrown by his pre-emptive strike. A slow, appreciative smile spread across her face. It was the smile of a master finding her apprentice has not only learned the lesson but has begun to anticipate the curriculum. "Richter," she said, the name a mark of respect now. "You are learning. It’s perfect. It’s sexy. It’s tormented. It is everything the tabloids are hoping for." She began to pace, her mind already moving on to the staging, the lighting, the camera angles. "But this song is not a declaration roared from a mountaintop. It's a whisper in a dark room. It requires a different kind of courage. Not defiance. Intimacy. You will not be able to hide behind the anger or the volume. The cameras will be so close they can see your pulse. The audience must not just hear you sing about desire; they must feel it, as if you are confessing it to each of them, and to each of them alone." The challenge was laid down, a far more subtle and perilous one than before. He had to undress his soul on stage, and do it without flinching.

The shift in rehearsals was immediate. The loud, cathartic energy of "Gewinner" was gone, replaced by a tense, focused quiet. Matteo worked with him on the song's delicate falsetto, on the breath control needed to make the notes hang in the air like smoke. Klaus found the melody and the lyrics resonated with a truth he had kept buried for years—the memory of a brief, intense, and ultimately doomed relationship from his university days, a love that had burned brightly before extinguishing itself, leaving him wary and closed off. It was a well of emotion he had sealed over with the concrete of his legal career. Now, Sabine was asking him to drill into it. The process was so all-consuming that he barely noticed the growing storm outside his practice room. Leon, whose own song for the week was a generic, upbeat pop track, watched Klaus’s intense, closed-door sessions with a look of curdling fury. The golden boy was being ignored, his polished charm no match for Klaus’s raw, marketable torment.

The breaking point came on a Thursday afternoon. Klaus was alone in a small studio, working with the audio engineer to get the reverb on his vocals just right, a detail he had become meticulously obsessed with. As he sang the song's aching hook, the power to his microphone and the monitors suddenly cut out, plunging the room into an abrupt, jarring silence. Through the glass of the control room, he saw Leon walking away down the corridor, a triumphant smirk on his face, his hand still near the main power strip on the wall. It was a petty, childish act of sabotage, but it was also a declaration of war. Klaus felt a familiar surge of cold anger, but this time, it was different. It was focused. He didn't shout. He calmly walked out of the studio and down the corridor, catching up to Leon at the vending machines. "A problem, Leon?" he asked, his voice dangerously quiet. Leon turned, feigning surprise. "Don't know what you're talking about, old man. Maybe your equipment is as worn out as you are." Klaus took a step closer, not menacingly, but with the unshakable confidence of a man who knew the law of gravity was on his side. "Your performance last week was technically proficient," Klaus said, his voice a clinical dissection. "But it was hollow. You have a good voice, but you have nothing to say. And that terrifies you. So you resort to tripping your opponents in the hallway. It's the only move you have left." He held Leon's furious gaze for a moment longer. "Don't do it again." He then turned and walked away, leaving Leon trembling with a rage made impotent by the calm, surgical precision of the attack.

That evening, the tension in the apartment was thick enough to taste. Klaus stood on the small balcony, trying to breathe in the cool night air, the confrontation with Leon replaying in his mind. He had won the skirmish, but it had left a bitter, ugly residue. This was the part of the game he hated, the part that had nothing to do with music. Elara came to stand beside him, a silent companion in the darkness. "I heard what happened," she said, her voice a low murmur. "He's getting desperate." Klaus let out a long, weary breath. "Is this what it's like?" he asked, looking out at the glittering, indifferent city. "This constant, ugly jockeying for position?" Elara leaned against the railing, her silhouette sharp against the skyline. "This is what it’s like when you're the one in the lead," she replied, her words devoid of pity, a simple statement of fact. "When you're climbing, everyone above you ignores you, and everyone below you is just trying to keep up. But when you get to the top, you become the target. There’s nowhere else for them to aim." She turned to look at him, her pale eyes reflecting the city lights. "They don't just want to win anymore, Klaus. Now, they need you to lose."The morning after the jailbreak, the atmosphere in the hotel had curdled.

Elara’s words were a cold, hard stone in Klaus’s gut as he walked into the studio on the day of the third live show. The air in the green room was no longer just tense; it was toxic. The remaining contestants were now circling each other like sharks in a shrinking tank, the scent of blood in the water. Leon sat alone in a corner, earbuds in, his leg jiggling with a furious, contained energy. He refused to look at anyone, his face a thunderous mask. The boyband, now down to their last three members, looked pale and exhausted, their synchronized outfits appearing more like prison uniforms. Klaus had become the show’s gravitational center, and his presence warped the very fabric of the competition, pulling everyone into his orbit while simultaneously pushing them away. He was the reason the game was harder, the bar was higher, and the odds were longer. And they all knew it.

His preparation was a quiet, internal affair. He found a secluded corner backstage, away from the frantic energy of the hair and makeup artists, and closed his eyes. He did not think about the notes or the lyrics. He thought about Anna. He allowed the memory, so long repressed, to surface. He saw her face, framed by dark hair, laughing in a smoky Cologne bar near the university. He felt the phantom warmth of her hand in his, the sharp, sweet sting of a love he had been too young and too cautious to hold onto. He remembered the quiet, painful conversation under a streetlamp where they had agreed to let it go, a mutual surrender to the sensible, pre-written futures that awaited them. He had filed that pain away like an old case, stamping it ‘closed’. Now, he unsealed the archive, not with a solicitor’s detachment, but with a singer’s need. He let the old ache fill him, a slow-acting poison that was the perfect catalyst for the song he was about to sing.

When he walked onto the stage, the world fell away. The roaring crowd, the expectant judges, the entire machinery of the show became a distant hum. Sabine had been true to her word. The stage was almost completely dark, shrouded in a low-lying mist. A single, soft blue spotlight found him, isolating him in a bubble of intimate light. The iconic, tremolo-soaked guitar riff of "Wicked Game" began, a sound that was pure, lonely desire. He stood perfectly still, his hands in his pockets, a casual posture that was a universe away from the stiff terror of his first performance. He let the opening bars wash over him, letting the silence and the anticipation build to an almost unbearable point. Then, he looked directly into the lens of the main camera, which was gliding towards him on a silent track, and began to sing.

His voice was a whisper, a low, resonant murmur that forced the entire arena to lean in. It was a sound so intimate, so devoid of artifice, that it felt as if he were confessing a secret directly into the ear of every single person watching. He didn’t perform the song; he inhabited it. The camera came closer, and he didn’t flinch. He held its gaze, his eyes reflecting the blue light, letting them see the flicker of a memory, the shadow of a long-extinguished flame. When he reached the song’s famous falsetto on the line, *“No, I don’t wanna fall in love,”* his voice did not soar. It fractured, a beautiful, delicate crack that was more powerful than any shout. It was the sound of a man trying, and failing, to convince himself. He was no longer Klaus Richter, the singer, or the solicitor. He was just a man, laid bare, wrestling with the ghost of a wicked game he had once played and lost. The song ended not with a crash, but with the slow, fading echo of the final guitar chord, leaving him standing alone in the shrinking spotlight, the silence he left behind as profound and complete as the one before he began.

For a moment, there was nothing. The audience seemed to have collectively forgotten to breathe. Then, the applause started, not the explosive roar of the week before, but a wave of deep, sustained sound, a testament to a shared, deeply felt experience. The lead judge simply stared at him, running a hand over his face. "Richter," he said, his voice thick with emotion, "some people come on this stage and sing a love song. You just built a cathedral to heartbreak and made every single one of us pray in it. I don't know where you go to find that… but I am grateful, and frankly a little terrified, that you are willing to take us there." The other judges were equally stunned, speaking of a "masterclass in vulnerability" and "the power of quiet." Klaus accepted the praise with a quiet nod, his mind still half-lost in the blue-lit mist of his own memory. He had not just performed a song; he had conducted a séance.

The elimination round was brutal. The bottom two were announced: one of the remaining boyband members and Leon. Leon’s face went white with shock, his expression one of pure, incredulous fury. The sing-off was a stark, desperate battle. The boyband member sang a heartfelt, if slightly shaky, pop ballad. Then it was Leon’s turn. He strode to the center of the stage, his jaw tight, and launched into a technically dazzling display of vocal acrobatics, a song full of high notes and complex runs. He sang with the fury of a cornered animal, his voice a weapon aimed directly at the judges’ table. But it was all technique, no heart. It was a desperate, angry plea for validation from a man who had nothing left to say. He was trying to win a fistfight while Klaus had been winning a war of souls. The judges conferred, their decision swift and unanimous. Leon was going home. As the verdict was delivered, a look of utter, broken disbelief washed over his face. He shook his head, refusing to accept it. As he was given his final moments on stage, he snatched the microphone from the host. "This is a joke," he spat, his eyes finding Klaus in the line of survivors. "You all want sad stories? You want a walking tragedy? Fine. Have him. But don't call it a singing competition." He threw the microphone to the floor with a loud, clattering thud and stormed off the stage without a backward glance, leaving a stunned silence in his wake.

Later, in the quiet of the apartment, the ugly victory felt like a defeat. Klaus stood on the balcony, the confrontation with Leon and his bitter, public exit replaying in his mind. He had not gloated. He had not even felt relief. He felt only the grim, sickening finality of Elara’s prophecy coming true. One down. He heard the balcony door slide open, and she came to stand beside him, her presence a familiar comfort in the chaos. "He was always going to burn out," she said, her voice a low murmur against the city's hum. "He fought with his voice. You fight with your story. It was never a fair fight." Klaus looked out at the endless grid of lights, feeling more like a prisoner than a winner. "It doesn't feel like a victory," he confessed, his voice barely a whisper. "It feels like I'm just the last one standing in a graveyard." Elara was silent for a moment, her gaze fixed on the horizon. "That," she said, turning to him, her expression sober and resolute, "is exactly what winning is."Elara’s words were a cold, hard stone in Klaus’s gut as he walked into the studio on the day of the third live show.
