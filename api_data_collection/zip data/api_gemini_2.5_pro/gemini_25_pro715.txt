The silence in the small Toompea flat was a thick, treacly thing, sticking to the back of Liina’s throat. She stared at the page, but the words, a dense analysis of Netherlandish altarpieces, swam before her eyes like so many black, uninteresting fish. The book lay open, a testament to her good intentions, but her focus was elsewhere. It was entirely consumed by the small, dark rectangle of her phone, which sat on the scarred pine table like a pagan idol demanding supplication. It had been three days. Three days of this torturous, vibrating silence since the semi-finals of the *Vabariigi Maiasmokk*. The Republic’s Sweet-tooth. The most prestigious baking competition in all of Estonia.

She pushed a strand of honey-blonde hair from her forehead, her fingers coming away slightly damp. The air was close, smelling of old books and the lingering ghost of yesterday’s cardamom buns—a nervous habit, baking away the anxiety. It hadn’t worked. The anxiety remained, coiled and watchful in her gut. She’d replayed her performance a thousand times. The layered honey cake, a tribute to her home city’s medieval architecture, had been ambitious. The judges, a terrifying triumvirate of celebrity chefs and one notoriously dour food critic, had been unreadable. One had poked at the marzipan guard tower with a silver fork, his expression giving away nothing. Absolutely nothing. It was inhuman.

The sudden, jarring buzz of the phone against the wood made Liina jump so violently she knocked the art history book to the floor. It landed with a defeated thud. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic bird trapped in a cage of bone. She stared at the screen. Blocked Number. It was them. It had to be them. Her hand trembled as she swiped to answer, the motion clumsy and uncertain.

“Hello?” Her voice was a squeak, a mouse’s plea. She cleared her throat. “Hello, Liina Vesk speaking.”

“Good afternoon, Miss Vesk. This is Hendrik Palm from the production team of *Vabariigi Maiasmokk*.” The voice was smooth, professional, and utterly devoid of emotion. It was the voice of a man who held her entire world in his hands and was currently deciding whether to squeeze.

“Yes, hello,” she managed, her knuckles white where she gripped the phone.

“I am calling to follow up on your participation in the semi-final round this past weekend.” A pause. A truly sadistic, gut-wrenching pause. Liina felt her future splintering into two distinct paths: one led back to the dusty library stacks and a life of quiet academic obscurity; the other, to a gleaming studio kitchen, a whirlwind of flour and fame. “On behalf of the judges and the entire production, I would like to congratulate you. You have secured a place in the final.”

The world tilted. The air rushed back into her lungs in a dizzying, euphoric gasp. “The final?” she whispered, disbelief warring with a tidal wave of joy. “Really? I’m in?”

“Indeed,” said Hendrik Palm, a sliver of warmth finally entering his tone. “Your honey cake was… structurally impressive. The judges were particularly taken with the spiced plum filling. It showed great technical skill and a clear narrative. You will receive an email within the hour with the full brief for the final, including logistical details. It will be held in two weeks’ time. Congratulations again, Liina. We look forward to seeing what you create.”

The line went dead. Liina stood, frozen, the phone still pressed to her ear, listening to the empty hiss of the disconnected call. Then, a sound escaped her, a whoop that was half-laugh, half-sob. She dropped the phone onto the worn sofa and danced a clumsy, stomping jig on the threadbare rug, her arms flailing.

“Kaisa!” she shrieked, launching herself toward the closed bedroom door. “Kaisa, you are not going to believe this!”

The door opened to reveal her roommate, Kaisa, a law student with perpetually tired eyes and a coffee mug permanently attached to her hand. She blinked slowly, unimpressed. “Is the building on fire? Because unless the answer is yes, you owe me for waking me up from what was promising to be a landmark nap.”

“I’m in! I got in! The final!” Liina grabbed Kaisa by the shoulders, shaking her gently. “The *Vabariigi Maiasmokk* final! He just called! Hendrik Palm himself!”

Kaisa’s tired expression melted away, replaced by a wide, genuine grin. “No! Liina, are you serious? The final? You did it!” She wrapped her arms around Liina in a fierce hug, lifting her off the ground. “I knew it! That miserable old food critic, I saw him go back for a second piece of your marzipan wall. I knew he was a fraud! He loved it!”

They broke apart, both laughing. The tiny flat, which moments before had felt like a prison cell, was now a palace, a grand hall for their celebration. Kaisa rummaged in their miniature fridge and emerged, triumphantly, with a bottle of cheap sparkling wine they’d been saving for a special occasion. “This,” she declared, wrestling with the cork, “is a special occasion. To Liina Vesk, future sweet-tooth of the Republic!”

The cork flew off with a satisfying pop, ricocheting off a framed print of Tallinn’s skyline. They drank the fizzing, overly sweet wine straight from the bottle, passing it back and forth as Liina recounted the phone call, her voice still giddy with disbelief.

“Two weeks,” Liina said, pacing the length of the small living room. “I have two weeks to create a masterpiece. A showstopper to end all showstoppers.”

“You’ll do it,” Kaisa said, taking a swig. “Your vanaema’s recipes are basically magic. You’ve got this.”

Liina stopped at the bookshelf and pulled out a heavy, leather-bound book. The cover was worn smooth in places, the title long since faded away. It was her grandmother’s recipe journal, her most prized possession. She’d inherited it when Vanaema Elvi had passed two years ago, and with it, a legacy of sugar and spice. Her vanaema had been the undisputed queen of baking in her small Hiiumaa village, a woman who could conjure comfort and joy from little more than flour, eggs, and whatever fruit was in season. Every page was a memory, filled with her grandmother’s spidery, elegant script, dotted with stains of butter and vanilla extract. Baking wasn't just a hobby for Liina; it was a conversation with the woman who had raised her. Winning this competition, it would be for her.

The promised email pinged into her inbox. Kaisa crowded behind her as she opened it, the two of them reading over the screen.

“‘The Grand Final Showstopper challenge,’” Kaisa read aloud, “‘will be themed: ‘A Taste of the Estonian Landscape.’ Contestants are expected to create an elaborate dessert that tells a story of their connection to the natural beauty of our nation…’ Blah, blah, blah… ‘The final will be filmed on location…’” Kaisa paused, squinting at the screen. “Oh, you are kidding me. Pädaste Manor on Muhu island? That’s not a film set, that’s where presidents go on holiday. Fancy.”

Liina’s eyes widened. She’d seen pictures of Pädaste, a gorgeously restored manor house surrounded by pristine coastline and ancient juniper groves. It was the stuff of fairytales. To bake there, to create something inspired by that landscape… a thrill went through her.

Kaisa was already typing furiously on her own phone. “Okay, let’s see… five-star hotel, gourmet restaurant, seaside spa… oh, this is good.” She snorted with laughter. “Listen to this review on a travel blog: ‘An unforgettable experience of luxury and tranquility. The staff are wonderful, the food is divine, though a word of warning to picnickers: the local wildlife is bold. One particular rabbit has reportedly made off with an entire croissant from a guest’s plate. The staff have nicknamed him ‘Jaan the Terrible’.’”

Liina laughed, the image of a fluffy pirate making off with a pastry momentarily distracting her. “Jaan the Terrible? That’s ridiculous.” A rabbit. It seemed a world away from the high-stakes pressure of the final. Her mind was already racing, turning over flavours and textures. Muhu island. The sea, the forest, the wildflowers. She could use sea buckthorn, foraged herbs, maybe something with wild berries. The landscape itself would be her pantry.

She flipped through her vanaema’s journal, her fingers tracing the familiar script. She needed something special, something that spoke of both the ruggedness of the coast and the delicate beauty of the manor. Her eyes landed on a page near the back. It was a recipe for a ‘Moon-White Meringue Cake,’ a cloud-like construction of airy meringue, whipped cream, and white currants. But it wasn't the recipe that caught her eye. It was the note scrawled in the margin in her vanaema’s hand.

*‘For a true celebration. Must be perfect. As delicate as a wild thing.’*

A wild thing. The phrase echoed in her mind. An idea began to form, a fragile, shimmering concept. A cake that looked like a wild meadow, adorned with spun sugar dew-drops and crystallized flowers. It would be ethereal and beautiful. It would be a tribute to Pädaste, to Estonia, and to Vanaema Elvi. It would be perfect. She closed the book, a new, steely resolve settling over her. The giddiness was gone, replaced by the focused, humming energy of a creator. Two weeks. She had two weeks to tame the wild and turn it into a prize-winning cake.The next two weeks were a blur of meticulous planning and frantic execution. The celebratory bottle of sparkling wine was quickly forgotten, replaced by canisters of flour, sugar, and a growing collection of strange-smelling jars and packets. The small flat became a laboratory dedicated to a single, all-consuming project. Liina covered the scarred pine table with parchment paper, sketching cross-sections of the cake, her art history training unexpectedly useful as she designed its structure. She envisioned layers of impossibly light meringue discs, like ancient stone circles, held together with a cream infused with meadowsweet. The tangy, brilliant orange of a sea buckthorn curd would cut through the sweetness, a flash of coastal colour against the stark white. Kaisa, navigating the minefield of cooling racks and bowls of mysterious concoctions, appointed herself official Head of Morale and Chief Tasting Officer, a role she took very seriously.

Her first attempt at the meringue was a catastrophe. The humid Tallinn air, thick with the promise of a summer rain, was the enemy of crispness. Liina followed her vanaema’s instructions to the letter, whipping the egg whites into a glossy, stiff-peaked mountain, folding in the sugar with a feather-light touch. But the cantankerous old oven, a relic from the Soviet era with a mind of its own, betrayed her. The delicate discs emerged not moon-white, but a sad, mottled beige, and they slumped with a sigh as soon as they met the air, turning chewy and disappointing. She scraped the failed attempt into the bin with a curse, the waste of a dozen eggs feeling like a physical blow. The anxiety she had briefly banished returned, whispering of failure and humiliation on a national stage.

Undeterred, Liina tried again the next day, this time armed with her grandmother’s marginalia as a guide. *'A dry day is a friend to meringue,'* one note read. Another, more cryptic: *'Patience is the sister of sugar.'* She waited for a rare, sun-drenched afternoon, throwing open the windows to let a dry breeze chase the humidity from the flat. She added a pinch of cornflour and a drop of white vinegar to the egg whites, tricks she’d learned from Vanaema Elvi to ensure stability. This time, she sat on a stool in front of the oven for the entire two hours of low, slow baking, watching the meringues like a hawk, refusing to let them fail. When the timer finally went off, she cracked the oven door and left them to cool inside for hours, an exercise in supreme self-restraint. They emerged perfect: ethereal, bone-white, and so light they seemed to hover above the parchment.

With the structure conquered, she turned her attention to the soul of the cake: the flavours of the landscape. She found a vendor at the central market, Balti Jaama Turg, who sold wild-foraged herbs and berries from across the country. She bought bags of dried meadowsweet, yarrow, and a small, precious punnet of cloudberries, their amber colour like tiny lanterns. Back in her kitchen, she infused cream with the fragrant, almond-like scent of the meadowsweet, the process filling the flat with the smell of a sun-drenched field. The sea buckthorn curd was a challenge of balance, a tightrope walk between its aggressive tartness and the sweetness required for a dessert. She made three batches, adjusting the sugar and adding a hint of fresh ginger to brighten the flavour, until Kaisa, tasting the final version with a critical frown, finally declared it "painfully delicious."

The crystallized flowers were the final, most delicate touch. Following another of her vanaema’s obscure notes, she spent an entire afternoon with a tiny paintbrush, a bowl of egg white, and a pot of caster sugar, painstakingly painting individual borage and cornflower petals she’d procured from a specialty grower. It was maddeningly intricate work, each petal a tiny, fragile jewel that could shatter with a clumsy breath. Kaisa found her hunched over the table late one night, her eyes red-rimmed from concentration, a constellation of shimmering blue and violet petals drying on a sheet of parchment before her. She didn't say a word, just quietly placed a mug of strong tea by Liina’s elbow and retreated, recognizing the sacred, slightly mad focus of an artist in the final throes of creation.

By the end of the two weeks, Liina was exhausted, running on little more than caffeine, sugar, and adrenaline. Her dreams were filled with collapsing cakes and the impassive face of the dour food critic. But in her fridge, packed into a series of carefully labelled boxes, were the components of her showstopper. She had practiced the assembly twice on smaller-scale models, her hands moving with a new confidence, a muscle memory built through hours of repetition. She had done everything she could. As she packed her knives and whisks for the trip to Muhu, she felt a quiet sense of readiness settle over her. The anxiety was still there, a low hum beneath the surface, but it was accompanied by a fierce, protective pride in what she had managed to create within the four walls of her tiny flat. She was not just bringing a cake to the final; she was bringing a piece of her history, a taste of her vanaema’s magic, and a story of the land she called home.The journey to Muhu felt like a crossing into another world. The ferry cut through the slate-grey waters of the Baltic, leaving the urban sprawl of the mainland behind. Liina stood on the open deck, the sharp, salty wind whipping her hair across her face and pulling at the scarf Kaisa had insisted she wear. The sky was a vast, dramatic canvas of bruised clouds and brilliant white, the same colours she had coaxed from egg whites and sugar. On the seat beside her, a cool box containing the most precious elements of her cake—the curd, the infused cream, the delicate crystallized petals—was guarded more fiercely than crown jewels. Her baking tools were in a large duffel bag at her feet, along with Vanaema Elvi’s journal, its weight a solid, comforting presence.

As the ferry docked, the island seemed to exhale a calmer, more ancient air. The frantic energy of Tallinn dissolved, replaced by the rustle of wind through reeds and the distant cry of a gull. The taxi ride to Pädaste was a journey back in time, past stone fences covered in moss, traditional farmhouses with thatched roofs, and fields dotted with grazing sheep that barely glanced at the car. Gnarled juniper trees, twisted into fantastical shapes by the constant coastal winds, lined the narrow road. Liina pressed her face to the window, absorbing every detail. This was the landscape she had tried to capture in sugar and cream. It felt less like an inspiration now, and more like a sacred ground she was about to tread upon. She hoped her creation would be seen as a tribute, not a cheap imitation.

Pädaste Manor emerged from behind a stand of old oaks not as a building, but as a vision. It was grander and more beautiful than any photograph had suggested, a harmonious blend of austere grey stone and elegant white trim, overlooking the serene waters of the bay. The grounds were immaculate, a manicured counterpoint to the wild beauty of the surrounding island. As the taxi crunched to a halt on the gravel drive, a liveried staff member glided forward to open her door. For a moment, Liina felt a paralyzing wave of imposter syndrome. She was a library-bound art history student from a cramped city flat, about to compete for a national title in a place that looked like it had been lifted from the pages of a magazine she couldn't afford. She gripped the handle of her duffel bag, the worn canvas grounding her.

“Miss Vesk? Welcome to Pädaste. We’ve been expecting you.” Hendrik Palm appeared at the top of the grand stone steps, his professional smile firmly in place. He was dressed not in a production crew hoodie, but in a tailored blazer, looking every bit as much a part of the manor as the antique statues flanking the entrance. Beside him stood a man Liina instantly recognised from the early rounds of the competition. It was Mart Kimmel, her fellow finalist. He was at least a decade older, with a severe haircut, fashionable glasses, and an air of unshakeable, slightly disdainful confidence. His signature style was architectural and minimalist, creating desserts that looked more like modern sculptures than food. He nodded curtly at Liina, his gaze sweeping over her duffel bag and cool box with an expression that verged on pity.

“Liina, good to see you,” Mart said, his voice as crisp and cool as his aesthetic. “I trust your components survived the ferry crossing? It can be so… rustic.”

“Everything’s fine, thank you, Mart,” Liina replied, forcing a warmth into her voice she did not feel. She felt a sudden, fierce protectiveness over her carefully packed boxes. Rustic. He said it like an insult. To Liina, rustic was the whole point. “Welcome, both of you,” Hendrik interjected smoothly, sensing the subtle friction. “Your rooms are ready, and we’ve arranged for your temperature-sensitive ingredients to be stored in the main kitchen refrigerators. We’ll have a brief orientation in one hour in the private dining room, followed by dinner. The final bake begins tomorrow morning at eight o’clock sharp. The filming kitchen is prepped and ready for you to inspect after the briefing.”

Liina’s room was larger than her entire flat. A vast, impossibly comfortable bed dominated the space, piled high with crisp linens and plush pillows. A set of French doors opened onto a small private terrace with a view of the sea, the water shimmering under the afternoon sun. On a polished antique desk sat a welcome basket filled with local Muhu bread, artisanal cheese, and a small bottle of wine—a world away from the cheap bubbly she and Kaisa had shared. The sheer luxury of it all was dizzying, designed to soothe and impress, but it only amplified the pressure. This was the big league. This was a place for winners.

After storing her precious cool box in the cavernous, gleaming stainless-steel kitchen—a space so professional it made her own oven seem like a child’s toy—Liina returned to her room. She ignored the welcome basket and the breathtaking view. Instead, she sat on the edge of the enormous bed and pulled her vanaema’s journal from her bag. She opened it to the page with the recipe for the Moon-White Meringue Cake. Her grandmother’s handwriting was a familiar comfort in the opulent, unfamiliar room. *‘As delicate as a wild thing.’* The words seemed to call to her from the page. She was here to honour that sentiment, to create something that spoke of the wind, the sea, and the wild, untamed beauty of this island. Mart could have his polished, urban perfection. She had magic. She had a legacy. She had her grandmother’s voice, whispering encouragement across the years. She took a deep breath, the scent of the sea air mixing with the old-paper smell of the book. The fear was still there, but now, it felt like fuel.The orientation took place in a room panelled with dark, richly scented oak. The three judges sat at one end of a long, polished table, observing Liina and Mart as they took their seats. Two were the celebrity chefs from the previous rounds: Chef Alani, a warm woman known for her innovative use of Estonian ingredients, and Chef Tomas, a patisserie superstar with a dazzling smile and perfectly coiffed hair. The third was the man Liina dreaded most: Rein Tamm, the food critic. He was a thin, severe man in a grey suit, whose infrequent praise was considered the highest honour in the Estonian culinary world, and whose criticism could wither a career before it had even begun. He stared at a point just above Liina’s head, his expression as blank and unforgiving as a winter sky.

Hendrik Palm ran through the logistics: a six-hour time limit, access to a shared pantry of basic ingredients, and the presence of a roaming camera crew. “The brief, as you know, is ‘A Taste of the Estonian Landscape,’” he concluded, steepling his fingers. “The judges will be looking for a showstopper that is not only technically brilliant and delicious, but that tells a compelling story. Any final questions?”

Mart leaned forward, the picture of composure. “Will we have access to a blast freezer?” he asked, the question itself a subtle boast about the advanced techniques he planned to employ.

“Of course, Mart,” Hendrik confirmed. He then turned to Liina. “Liina? Anything you need?”

“No, thank you,” she said quietly. “I have everything.” She felt Rein Tamm’s gaze finally drop to meet hers, a brief, assessing flicker before moving on. The look made her skin prickle.

Dinner was an exquisite ordeal. Course after course of Pädaste’s famed cuisine appeared, each a miniature work of art. Liina barely tasted them, her stomach a tight knot of nerves. The conversation was dominated by Mart, who chatted easily with Chef Tomas about the relative merits of different French butters and the structural integrity of isomalt. Chef Alani tried to draw Liina into the conversation, asking gentle questions about her background in art history.

“It must give you a unique perspective on composition,” the chef offered kindly.

“I hope so,” Liina managed. “I think of layers in a cake a bit like layers in a painting. They should build on each other.”

“A charming, if rather homespun, philosophy,” Mart interjected, dabbing his lips with a linen napkin. “I find inspiration in more modern forms. For my piece tomorrow, I’m exploring the concept of the erratic boulder—a geological feature common on the islands. A deconstructed blackcurrant sphere encased in a tempered chocolate shell, representing the stone, on a bed of dill and rye ‘moss’. It’s about the tension between nature and geometry.”

He looked directly at Liina as he said it, a clear challenge. His dessert sounded clever, intellectual, and intimidatingly modern. It sounded like something Rein Tamm would approve of.

“And you, Liina?” Chef Alani prompted, her eyes warm and encouraging. “What story will you be telling?”

Liina took a steadying breath. “My story is about the meadows and the coastline. It’s a meringue cake with meadowsweet cream, sea buckthorn, and wild flowers. It’s inspired by my grandmother’s baking. She was from Hiiumaa. For her, baking wasn’t about geometry, it was… about the feeling of a place. The wildness. That’s what I’m hoping to capture.”

“Ah, nostalgia,” Mart murmured, taking a sip of water. “A powerful seasoning.” The word was meant to sound like a compliment, but in his mouth, it landed like a diminutive pat on the head. He was dismissing her work as sentimental, the stuff of church bake-sales, not high-concept patisserie. Liina felt a flush of anger but held her tongue, instead meeting the dismissive smirk with a level gaze. Across the table, Rein Tamm’s expression remained utterly, unnervingly blank.

Later, back in the cavernous quiet of her room, Liina felt the walls closing in. The tense dinner had frayed her nerves raw. Mart’s casual condescension had lodged under her skin, and the critic’s stony silence echoed in her mind. She walked out onto the private terrace, breathing in the cool, damp air. The sun had set, leaving behind a sky of deepening indigo. The only sounds were the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore and the sigh of the wind in the junipers. It was a sound that reminded her of summers on Hiiumaa, of her vanaema’s garden.

Her eyes scanned the manicured lawn that sloped down towards the sea. In the half-light, she saw a flicker of movement near a bed of ornamental grasses. A rabbit, its silhouette sharp against the fading light, sat on its hind legs, nibbling on something with an air of complete nonchalance. It was utterly at home in this place of impossible luxury, boldly claiming its share. A small smile touched Liina’s lips. Jaan the Terrible, she thought, or one of his relatives. The sight of the small, wild creature, so defiant and unafraid, was a tonic. It was a reminder that authenticity had its own power, a strength that didn’t need to be deconstructed or encased in tempered chocolate. It simply was. She stayed out on the terrace until she grew cold, letting the peace of the island seep into her bones, pushing back the fear.

The next morning, she awoke before dawn. She dressed not in chef’s whites, but in her most comfortable jeans and a simple t-shirt, tying her hair back in a severe, practical braid. When she entered the designated filming kitchen, Mart was already there, standing at his station. He wore immaculate, custom-embroidered whites. His station was a picture of minimalist order: a digital tablet displaying his schematics, a row of identical bowls, a laser thermometer. Liina walked to her own station opposite him. The space was equally pristine, but she quickly made it her own. She laid out her worn-handled spatulas, her favorite whisk, the offset palette knife that fit her hand perfectly. And in the corner, propped against a stack of clean towels, she placed her vanaema’s leather-bound journal. It looked ancient and out of place amongst the gleaming technology, a piece of the old world in the new. Mart glanced at it, a flicker of amusement in his eyes, before turning back to his own preparations.

The film crew moved around them with a hushed efficiency, adjusting lights and checking microphones. Hendrik Palm and the three judges entered, taking their positions just off-set. The air grew thick with anticipation. Liina’s heart was a frantic drum against her ribs, but her hands, as she laid out her perfect, moon-white meringue discs, were steady. She looked across at Mart, who gave her a tight, confident smile. She simply nodded back, her focus turning inward. She was ready.

“Welcome, finalists, to the grand final of *Vabariigi Maiasmokk*,” Hendrik’s voice boomed, startlingly loud in the quiet room. “You have six hours to create your showstopper, ‘A Taste of the Estonian Landscape.’ The judges and all of Estonia are waiting to see what you can do.” He paused, his eyes sweeping over the two of them. “Your time… starts… now.”The first hour was a silent, intense ballet of preparation. The vast kitchen, which had felt so intimidating, shrank to the dimensions of Liina’s workbench. The cameras, the judges, the imposing figure of Mart across the aisle—they all faded into a peripheral blur. There was only the task at hand. She worked with an economy of motion honed by two weeks of obsessive practice. Her first step was the cream. She poured the cold, meadowsweet-infused liquid into a chilled metal bowl, the familiar, hay-like fragrance a calming balm. As the whisk attachment began to spin, she turned her attention to the sea buckthorn curd, tasting it one last time, the sharp, sun-bright tang waking up her palate.

Across from her, Mart’s station was a theatre of modern gastronomy. The hiss of a nitrous oxide canister being charged for a foam, the sharp snap of a silicone mould being prepped, the low hum of the blast freezer as he chilled components to precise temperatures. He moved with a surgeon’s focus, his movements sharp and angular, a stark contrast to Liina’s more fluid, intuitive rhythm. He was constructing; she was coaxing. He was imposing his will upon his ingredients, while she felt she was in dialogue with hers. The difference was palpable, hanging in the air between them like an unspoken argument about the very soul of food.

As the second hour began, a tiny bead of sweat traced a path down Liina’s temple. The studio lights, designed for high-definition television, beat down with surprising heat. She glanced at her bowl of cream. It wasn’t right. She’d whisked it to what should have been stiff peaks, but it was just a little too soft, a little too willing to slump. The warmth of the room was turning her ethereal cloud into a potential puddle. Panic, cold and sharp, pierced through her bubble of concentration. This was the foundation of the entire cake; if the cream failed, everything would collapse. She could see the headline: 'Finalist’s Meadow melts under pressure.'

She stopped the mixer, her mind racing. What would Vanaema Elvi have done? Her grandmother had baked through sweltering island summers in a kitchen heated by a wood-fired stove, and her cream was always perfect. The journal. Liina’s eyes darted to the worn leather book. She couldn’t stop to read it, but just looking at it seemed to focus her thoughts. *Patience is the sister of sugar.* Don’t panic. Think. The problem was warmth. The solution was cold. She quickly bundled the bowl of cream in a clean towel and rushed it to the main walk-in refrigerator, nesting it in a tray of ice she begged from a harried-looking production assistant. While it chilled, she took a deep, steadying breath and turned to a task that required no chilling: spinning sugar. It was a meditative process, flicking the hot syrup into impossibly fine, hair-like strands. The frantic beat of her heart began to slow, each golden thread a small victory against the rising tide of fear.

Half an hour later, the judges began their walk-through. They started with Mart. He stopped his work, wiped his hands on his pristine apron, and presented his concept as if delivering an academic lecture. “As you can see, judges, the tempered chocolate sphere is cooling. It will encase a fluid gel of blackcurrant and verbena. The base is a compressed crumble of rye and activated charcoal, to evoke the island’s soil. The final touch will be a dill and fennel pollen ‘moss’. It’s an exploration of the geological violence and quiet resilience of the Muhu landscape.” Chef Tomas nodded, visibly impressed. “Very ambitious, Mart. The precision required for that sphere is immense.” Even Rein Tamm seemed to give a fractional, almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement.

Then, they arrived at her station. It was a stark contrast to Mart’s clinical order. Here there were meringue discs of varying sizes laid out on parchment, a bowl of glistening orange curd, and the tray of delicate, shimmering flower petals. It looked less like a laboratory and more like an artist’s messy palette. Chef Alani smiled warmly. “Liina, this smells wonderful. Like a summer afternoon.”
“Thank you, Chef,” Liina said, her voice steadier than she expected. “It’s meadowsweet. I infused it into the cream. I’m hoping to bring the feeling of the fields around the manor onto the plate.”

Rein Tamm, the silent critic, bypassed the pleasantries. He moved with a surprising quickness, his sharp eyes scanning every element. He didn’t ask about her concept. Instead, he reached out a slender finger and picked up one of her crystallized borage petals, a tiny, perfect star of violet-blue. He held it between his thumb and forefinger, examining it under the harsh studio lights as if it were a rare gemstone. The silence stretched, thick and heavy. Liina held her breath. Finally, he spoke a single, cryptic word. “Fragile.” He placed the petal back down with surgical care, his gaze unreadable, and moved on. The word hung in the air behind him. Was it an observation? A compliment on her delicate work? Or was it a prediction of failure?

With the judges gone, Liina retrieved her cream. The intensive chilling had worked. It was firmer, colder, ready. She gave it a final, quick whisk and it held its shape beautifully, a billow of fragrant white. Relief washed through her, so potent it almost made her knees weak. Now, the assembly could begin. It was the part she loved, the point where disparate elements came together to create a whole. She laid down the largest meringue disc as her base, the sound a satisfying, crisp whisper against the plate. She piped a generous dam of cream around the edge and flooded the centre with the vibrant sea buckthorn curd. Another disc, more cream, more curd. Layer by layer, the cake grew, a tower of white and orange, texture and flavour. It was not the severe, perfect geometry of Mart’s sphere; it was organic, its edges uneven, like a real stone wall built by hand generations ago.

As the clock ticked past the four-hour mark, she looked up and saw Mart’s creation. He had placed his gleaming, flawless black sphere onto its bed of dark rye ‘moss’. It was breathtaking. A perfect, alien object dropped into a miniature landscape. It was bold, intelligent, and undeniably modern. For a heartbeat, Liina’s confidence wavered. Her own cake, now fully assembled and awaiting its final decorations, looked… gentle. Quaint. It looked like something a grandmother would make. It looked like everything Mart had subtly mocked her for. Doubt was a bitter taste in her mouth.

Her gaze fell again on the journal. *As delicate as a wild thing.* The phrase cut through the noise of her self-criticism. A wild thing wasn’t concerned with geometry or modernism. A wild thing was beautiful on its own terms. A wild orchid is no less stunning for not being a skyscraper. She thought of the rabbit on the lawn, bold and untroubled in the face of overwhelming grandeur. Her cake wasn't quaint; it was alive. It was a tribute to a different kind of beauty, a quieter, more enduring one. The doubt receded, replaced by a fresh wave of resolve. She picked up her bag of spun sugar.

The final hour was a masterclass in controlled urgency. The hushed atmosphere of the kitchen was gone, replaced by the relentless countdown from Hendrik Palm and the frantic energy of two artists racing against time. Mart worked with tweezers, placing individual fronds of dill on his creation with microscopic precision. Liina’s hands, now dusted with powdered sugar, moved with a focused grace. She draped the spun sugar over the top of the cake like a morning mist clinging to a hill. Then came the flowers. This was the most terrifying part. Her hands, which had been so steady, now trembled with a mixture of fatigue and adrenaline. Each petal was a breath held, a tiny prayer. A blue cornflower here, a violet borage star there. She wasn’t arranging them in a perfect pattern, but scattering them as if a breeze had blown through a meadow and left them where they fell.

“One minute remaining!” Hendrik’s voice cracked like a whip.

Liina’s heart hammered. She had one final touch. A single, perfect, crystallized wild pansy, its face a mix of purple and yellow. It was the most beautiful one she had made. She picked it up. Her fingers felt clumsy, thick. She placed it right at the peak of the cake, the final jewel in her wild crown.

“Ten, nine, eight…”

She stepped back, scanning her work. It was done. Nothing more she could do.

“…three, two, one… Time’s up! Finalists, please step away from your creations!”

The command was absolute. Liina took two steps back from her bench, her body thrumming with spent adrenaline. Mart set down his tweezers and did the same. A profound silence fell over the studio. For six hours, they had been in their own worlds. Now, for the first time, they stood side by side, their work presented for judgement.

The contrast was staggering. On one pedestal stood Mart’s Erratic Boulder. It was a marvel of technique, a dark, glossy sphere of impossible perfection, nestled on a bed of artful, sombre green and black. It was dramatic, moody, and deeply intellectual. A piece of edible sculpture. On the other pedestal stood Liina’s Moon-White Meringue Cake. It was a riot of life. A rustic, multi-layered tower of brilliant white, streaked with the vibrant orange of the sun. It was draped in shimmering, ethereal sugar-mist and scattered with what looked like tiny, real wildflowers. It didn’t command respect like Mart’s; it invited joy. One was a monument. The other was a meadow. Two visions of the Estonian landscape, utterly opposed, and utterly complete. The judges stared, their faces giving away nothing, and prepared to taste the future of Estonian baking.The walk from their workstations to the judging table felt a mile long. Liina’s legs were unsteady, her entire body humming with a strange, hollow exhaustion. She and Mart stood behind their creations as the three judges rose and approached, their faces serious. The camera crew closed in, the whir of their lenses the only sound in the cavernous room. They began with Mart’s dessert, as protocol dictated for the more experienced contestant.

Rein Tamm was the first to act. He picked up a small, polished hammer, a tool Mart had provided, and with a single, sharp tap, shattered the perfect black chocolate sphere. The sound was like a gunshot in the silence. The shell broke apart into glossy black shards, revealing the deep purple, wobbling gel within. The effect was dramatic, a controlled act of destruction. Chef Tomas let out a low whistle of appreciation for the technical skill. “The temper on that chocolate is perfect, Mart. Glass-like.”

Each judge took a small spoon and dipped it into the mixture of broken chocolate, gel, and rye crumble. They tasted in silence, a synchronised, critical ritual. Chef Tomas nodded slowly. “The flavour combination is very clever. The earthy rye, the sharp blackcurrant, the herbaceous note of the dill… it’s unexpected. It’s a very intellectual dessert.” Chef Alani added, “The concept is strong, and the execution is flawless. It looks exactly like what you described—a piece of the island’s geology on a plate. It’s thought-provoking.”

Then it was Rein Tamm’s turn. He swirled the mixture on his tongue for a long moment, his eyes closed. He set his spoon down with a soft click. “The technique is undeniable,” he began, his voice flat and precise. “The sphere is a feat of patisserie. The temperature contrast between the chilled gel and the room-temperature shell is effective.” He paused, and Mart visibly straightened, awaiting the praise. “However,” the critic continued, his eyes still fixed on the shattered dessert, “it is a piece that demands admiration more than it invites enjoyment. It is cold. Not in temperature, but in spirit. It tells me of your skill, but it does not tell me of the landscape’s soul.” Mart’s confident posture deflated, just slightly, as if a pin had pricked a balloon. The critique was not a condemnation, but it was not a coronation either.

Then, all three judges turned their attention to Liina’s cake. It stood in stark, almost defiant contrast to Mart’s creation. Where his was dark and minimalist, hers was a chaotic celebration of light and colour. It wasn’t a perfect tower; it listed slightly to one side, like an old tree in the wind. The spun sugar was already beginning to melt ever so slightly under the hot lights, giving it a dewy, ephemeral quality. Liina’s heart sank. It looked imperfect. It looked… homemade.

But Chef Alani’s eyes lit up. “Oh, Liina,” she breathed, her voice filled with a surprising warmth. “It looks alive. It looks like you’ve scooped up a piece of a meadow and put it on a plate.” She took a silver cake slice and pressed it into the top layer. The sound was magical. A distinct, crisp crackle as the slice broke through the meringue, followed by a soft sigh as it sank through the layers of cream and curd. It was the sound of a perfect crème brûlée crust breaking, magnified and layered. She placed a generous slice on each of the three plates. The cross-section was beautiful, a rustic stratigraphy of brilliant white meringue, pale cream, and a ribbon of sunset-orange curd.

They tasted. Liina watched, her hands clenched into fists at her sides. She saw Chef Tomas’s eyebrows lift in surprise as he took his first bite. She saw Chef Alani close her eyes, a slow smile spreading across her face. But she couldn’t look at Rein Tamm. She stared at the floor, at her worn-out trainers, unable to bear his inevitable look of disdain.

“Liina,” Chef Tomas said, his voice different now, stripped of its showman’s bravado. “This meringue… it’s a miracle. It’s as light as air, but it’s crisp, it dissolves on the tongue. It’s a classic technique, often done, but rarely done this perfectly. And the balance… that sea buckthorn curd is aggressive, but the meadowsweet cream calms it, tames it. It’s a dance. I had my reservations about the concept, I’ll admit. But the flavour… the flavour is undeniable.”

Chef Alani was next, her voice thick with emotion. “This is more than a cake. This is a memory. I taste my childhood in this. I taste summers picking flowers, the smell of hay in the air. You said you wanted to capture the feeling of a place, and you have. This isn’t just ‘A Taste of the Estonian Landscape’—this *is* the Estonian landscape. It’s honest and it’s beautiful and it’s absolutely delicious.”

Finally, there was only silence from Rein Tamm’s end of the table. Liina forced herself to look up. He had finished his slice. His plate was clean. He was staring at it, his expression thoughtful, distant. He had not said a word. He slowly raised his gaze from the empty plate to meet Liina’s. His eyes, which she had thought were cold and empty, now held a strange, reflective light. “Miss Vesk,” he said, his voice quiet but carrying across the studio. “Earlier, I called your decoration fragile.” Liina’s stomach clenched. “I was correct. It is fragile. The meringue is fragile. The spun sugar is fragile. The petals are fragile.” He paused, picking up his water glass. “This cake is a testament to the profound power of fragile things. It is not an intellectual exercise. It is not a monument to be admired from a distance. It is an invitation. It has what Mart’s dessert, for all its technical brilliance, lacks. It has a heart.” He took a sip of water, his gaze unwavering. “It reminds me of a cake my own grandmother used to make. I haven’t tasted anything like it in thirty years.”

The verdict had been delivered, not by a scorecard, but by a memory. A tear that Liina hadn't even realised was forming slid down her cheek. She hastily wiped it away. Across from her, Mart stared at the critic, his face a mask of disbelief. He had been beaten, not by superior technique or a more modern concept, but by nostalgia. By a ghost. The judges retreated to make their final decision, but the atmosphere in the room had already shifted. The winner had been chosen.

When they returned, it was a formality. Hendrik Palm stood between the two pedestals, a golden envelope in his hand. “The judges have agreed that both of you have shown exceptional skill and artistry. You have both created something remarkable. But there can only be one winner. The baker who not only fulfilled the brief but captured the very essence of our theme, whose creation told a story that was both personal and universal… the new *Vabariigi Maiasmokk* is… Liina Vesk.”

The world dissolved into a blur of sound and light. Kaisa’s imagined shriek echoed in her head. Chef Alani was hugging her. Chef Tomas was shaking her hand vigorously. A heavy, beautiful glass trophy was pressed into her hands. Through it all, she saw Mart. He walked over to her, his face stiff. For a moment she thought he would say something bitter, but instead, he extended his hand. “Congratulations, Liina,” he said, his voice tight but his handshake firm. “It was… a beautiful cake.” It was the highest praise he was capable of giving, and Liina knew it.

Later, after the cameras had stopped rolling and the crew was packing up, Liina stood alone on her private terrace, the cool glass of the trophy heavy in her hands. The sun was setting over the water, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink that mirrored her sea buckthorn curd. The air was calm, scented with salt and juniper. In the distance, near the edge of the woods, she saw a flicker of movement. A rabbit, perhaps even Jaan the Terrible himself, nibbling peacefully at the grass. She thought of her vanaema’s spidery script, of the worn leather journal that now felt less like a book of recipes and more like a map that had led her here. She had won. She had taken the fragile, wild things—the memories, the flowers, the flavours of home—and shown that they were the strongest things of all. She lifted the trophy in a silent toast, not to the cameras or the judges, but to the old woman from Hiiumaa, and to the quiet, indomitable spirit of the wild things.The chaotic joy of the winner’s announcement was a disorienting storm of flashing lights, confetti, and a dozen people talking to her at once. Liina smiled and nodded, the heavy glass trophy feeling alien and enormous in her trembling hands. She mumbled thank yous, answered questions she couldn’t quite hear, and felt a vague sense of floating outside her own body. It wasn't until she was back in the sublime, silent peace of her manor room, the door firmly closed against the receding tide of the production crew, that the reality of it crashed over her. She set the trophy down on the polished antique desk and simply stared at it, her reflection warped and distorted in its smooth, curved surface. Then, with a frantic fumbling that belied her earlier delicate work with the sugar petals, she snatched up her phone.

Kaisa answered on the first ring, her voice a panicked squawk. “Liina? What happened? Did you trip? Did Mart poison your curd? The show’s not on for another three weeks, this is torture, I’m going to have an aneurysm!” Liina let out a laugh that was more of a sob, the tension of the last six hours finally breaking. “Kaisa,” she gasped, sinking onto the edge of the impossibly plush bed. “I won. I won the whole thing.” A beat of complete silence on the other end of the line was followed by a shriek so loud and piercing that Liina had to pull the phone away from her ear. “YOU DID WHAT? YOU WON? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? LIINA VESK, I AM GOING TO BUY EVERY BOTTLE OF CHEAP SPARKLING WINE IN TALLINN! WE ARE GOING TO FILL THE BATHTUB WITH IT!” The pure, unadulterated joy radiating through the phone was the most real thing Liina had felt all day. They babbled for another ten minutes, a breathless, overlapping torrent of disbelief and celebration, before Liina, utterly drained, promised to call the second she was back on the mainland.

The journey back was the reverse of her arrival, but everything looked different. The ancient juniper trees seemed to nod in approval, the grey Baltic sea sparkled with a friendly light, and the ferry horn sounded less like a mournful sigh and more like a trumpet fanfare. She sat on the deck, the trophy wrapped carefully in a production-supplied blanket inside her duffel bag, its weight a constant, solid reminder against her leg. She had left Pädaste Manor feeling like Cinderella leaving the ball, half-expecting her victory to vanish at midnight. But the trophy was real. The congratulations from Hendrik Palm, who had shaken her hand with genuine warmth and respect, had been real. Rein Tamm’s final, quiet words were seared into her memory, more valuable than any prize money. She had done it. She had honoured her vanaema’s legacy not just in the quiet of her kitchen, but on a national stage.

Stepping out of the taxi into the familiar, cobblestoned quiet of her Toompea street was like waking from a strange and glorious dream. The air was thick with the scent of rain on old stone and the faint, garlicky aroma from the tourist restaurant down the lane. Her building, with its peeling paint and crooked entryway, looked wonderfully, beautifully normal. As she climbed the winding stairs, the muffled thumping of celebratory music grew louder. She opened the door to her flat to find Kaisa had made good on her promise. The tiny living room was decked out with a string of mismatched fairy lights, a hand-painted sign that read ‘VABARIIGI MAIASMOKK LIVES HERE!!!’, and on the scarred pine table sat no fewer than five bottles of the cheapest sparkling wine money could buy. Kaisa, wearing a makeshift paper crown, let out a whoop and tackled her in a hug that nearly sent them both tumbling into the bookshelf. “SHE’S HOME! THE QUEEN RETURNS TO HER PALACE!” Kaisa roared, uncorking a bottle with a reckless abandon that sent foam spraying onto the art history book Liina had knocked to the floor what felt like a lifetime ago.

They drank from mugs, the sweet, fizzy wine tasting like pure happiness. Liina recounted every detail of the final bake, from the terrifying moment with the cream to the satisfying crackle the cake made when Chef Alani sliced into it. She described Mart’s architectural sphere and Rein Tamm’s shocking moment of sentimental reflection. Kaisa listened with rapt attention, interjecting with gasps and cheers. "He said it reminded him of his grandmother? The iceman! The critic who probably critiques his own reflection in the morning! Liina, you didn't just win a baking show, you healed a man's broken childhood with meringue! That's basically a superpower!" The tiny flat, once a symbol of her quiet, academic life, was now the epicentre of her new reality, filled with laughter and light and the glorious, sticky promise of cheap wine.

Amid the celebration, Liina’s laptop, forgotten on the sofa, pinged with the arrival of a new email. Wiping her sticky fingers on her jeans, she opened it. The subject line read: ‘Congratulations from the Vabariigi Maiasmokk Production Team’. Kaisa leaned over her shoulder, her paper crown askew. The email was from Hendrik Palm. It restated the official congratulations and then outlined the prizes that came with the title. There was a significant cash prize that made Liina’s head spin, a series of guest appearances on a popular morning show, and a contract to be the new face of a high-end kitchen appliance brand. But it was the final item on the list that made her breath catch in her throat. “A publishing contract,” Kaisa read aloud, her voice dropping to a whisper of awe. “With Kirjastus Varrak, for a cookbook to be published next autumn. Liina… you’re going to be an author.”

A cookbook. The words resonated deep within her. It wasn’t just about recipes. It was about stories. It was about legacy. She looked from the glowing screen of the laptop to the heavy, leather-bound journal sitting on her bookshelf. For years, she had been a keeper of stories, a reader of other people’s histories in art and text. Now, she had the chance to write her own. The idea was both exhilarating and terrifying. It felt bigger, more permanent than a television victory. A book was a tangible thing, something that would sit on shelves in other people’s homes, its pages hopefully becoming stained with butter and vanilla, just like her vanaema’s. The giddiness of the victory began to subside, replaced by a profound, weighty sense of purpose. She knew, with a sudden, unshakeable clarity, what her first step had to be. “Kaisa,” she said, closing the laptop. “I need to go to Hiiumaa.” Kaisa looked at her, her celebratory grin softening into an understanding smile. “To see Vanaema Elvi’s house?” Liina nodded. “To start at the beginning.”The second ferry journey in as many weeks felt like travelling in the opposite direction through time. The trip to Muhu had been a voyage into a glossy, modern fairytale of luxury and high-stakes performance. This journey, westward to Hiiumaa, was a retreat into the past, into the bedrock of memory. There was no pristine cool box of fragile components, only her duffel bag, the glass trophy carefully swaddled in sweaters, and Vanaema Elvi’s journal, which felt heavier and more significant than ever. The ferry was smaller, older, more functional, carrying islanders returning with supplies and a handful of hardy-looking tourists in hiking boots. The salt spray that hit Liina’s face as she stood on the deck felt less like a bracing challenge and more like a familiar, welcoming kiss. This was not a landscape she needed to interpret or capture; this was a landscape she was part of.

The bus from the port rumbled along roads even narrower and more rustic than Muhu’s, through dense pine forests whose floor was a carpet of moss and fallen needles. The air that drifted through the open window was thick with the resinous scent of pine and the damp, loamy smell of the earth. She got off at a small, unassuming stop marked by little more than a weathered wooden bench. From there, it was a twenty-minute walk down a gravel track that was more grass than stone. The silence here was different from the charged quiet of the competition kitchen or the anxious stillness of her flat. It was a deep, living silence, punctuated by the buzz of a bumblebee, the rustle of a finch in the hedgerow, and the distant, rhythmic sigh of the sea.

The house appeared at the end of the track, nestled in a gentle hollow and flanked by two ancient, sprawling apple trees. It was a simple, timber-clad cottage, its once-blue paint faded by sun and sea-salt to a soft, silvery grey. The thatched roof was shaggy and overgrown in places, sprouting tufts of grass and wildflowers, making it look as though the house was slowly being reclaimed by the meadow around it. It had been empty for two years, cared for only by a neighbour who made sure the pipes didn’t burst in winter and the windows weren't broken by storms. Liina stood for a long moment, key in hand, just looking at it. It was smaller than she remembered, yet it held the entirety of her childhood summers. It was here she’d learned the names of the wildflowers, the difference between a good baking apple and a good eating apple, and the profound, unspoken language of care that was kneading dough for someone you loved.

The key turned in the lock with a rusty groan, and the heavy wooden door swung inward, releasing a breath of trapped air. The smell hit her first, a complex perfume of cold woodsmoke from the long-dead hearth, the faint, phantom sweetness of dried chamomile, and the papery scent of old books and time itself. It was the smell of her vanaema. The front room was shrouded in a dim, dusty light, with old linen sheets draped over the furniture like pale ghosts. Liina moved through the space, her footsteps unnaturally loud on the worn floorboards, and pulled the sheet off a familiar armchair. A puff of dust motes danced in a sunbeam slanting through the grimy windowpane. She ran a hand over the worn, floral-print fabric, half-expecting her grandmother to look up from her knitting and scold her for bringing the outside in.

It was the kitchen, however, that drew her like a magnet. It was at the back of the house, small and simple, with a low ceiling and a large window that looked out onto the overgrown garden. Here, nothing was covered. It had been left as if Vanaema Elvi had just stepped out for a moment. A row of mismatched ceramic jars stood on an open shelf, their handwritten labels—*Köömned*, *Nelk*, *Muskaat* (Caraway, Clove, Nutmeg)—faded but legible. A collection of well-used wooden spoons stood in a crock by the stove, their tips stained dark from years of stirring berry jams and rich sauces. The countertops, made of thick planks of scrubbed pine, were scarred with the faint arcs of a million knife cuts, the geography of a lifetime of cooking. This was not the gleaming, sterile stainless steel of the competition kitchen; this was a workspace that held stories, that was a story in itself. She walked over to the black iron stove, the cantankerous heart of the house, and laid a hand on its cold surface. It was on this very stove that she’d first learned the alchemy of turning eggs and sugar into meringue, her grandmother’s patient hand guiding her own.

Drawn by the green light, she pushed open the back door and stepped out into the garden. It had, as she expected, run wild. What was once a series of neat, productive beds was now a tangled, chaotic riot of life. The neat paths were gone, swallowed by creeping thyme and clover. A massive rhubarb plant, its leaves like elephant ears, dominated one corner, thriving on the neglect. The raspberry canes had escaped their rows and were marching into the lawn, their thorny branches laden with the promise of late-summer fruit. Along the old stone wall, wild strawberries grew in thick patches, their tiny red jewels peeking out from beneath the leaves. It was untamed, unruly, and breathtakingly beautiful. It wasn't a pristine manor lawn or a minimalist’s bed of moss; it was a testament to the sheer, stubborn force of life. A wild thing, in its truest form.

Liina wandered through the tangled Eden, her fingers brushing against the feathery fronds of dill that had self-seeded everywhere, releasing its sharp, anise-like scent. She found the old chamomile patch, now a sprawling mat of tiny, daisy-like flowers. She knelt and picked one, crushing it between her fingers and inhaling the sweet, apple-like fragrance. This was the source. This was where the magic came from. Not just from the recipes in the journal, but from this patch of earth, this cycle of growth, harvest, and decay. The cookbook couldn’t just be a list of instructions. It had to be a portrait of this place, a guide to its flavours, a translation of its wild, gentle spirit. She suddenly saw the chapters laid out in her mind, not by type of pastry, but by season. ‘Spring Rhubarb and the First Herbs.’ ‘High-Summer and the Wild Berries.’ ‘Autumn Apples and the Last of the Plums.’ ‘Winter Spices and the Preserved Sun.’

Returning to the kitchen, invigorated and filled with a quiet, humming energy, she began to set up her new workspace. She opened the kitchen window wide, the sweet, green scent of the wild garden flooding the room and chasing out the stale air. She took a cloth and wiped down the surface of the thick pine table, clearing away the fine layer of dust to reveal the pale, scarred wood beneath. From her bag, she took out the heavy, leather-bound journal and placed it on one side of the table. On the other, she placed a new, completely empty notebook with a plain brown cover. The old and the new. The inheritance and the interpretation. The silence of the house settled around her, no longer empty or sad, but filled with the promise of work to be done. It was the silence of a blank page, waiting for the first word. Liina sat down, opened the fresh notebook, and wrote: *Chapter One: A Taste of Hiiumaa.*The first days in the cottage were a ritual of reawakening. Liina worked from dawn until dusk, not with the frantic energy of the competition, but with a slow, deliberate rhythm that matched the pace of the island itself. She started by throwing open every window, letting the sea-and-pine-scented air wage a gentle war against the musty smell of disuse. She swept away two years of dust and cobwebs, the swish of her broom on the wooden floors a steady, percussive beat. With buckets of hot water and vinegar, she washed the grime from the windowpanes, and as the light streamed in, clear and bright, it felt as though the house was opening its eyes after a long slumber. She pulled the sheets from the furniture, washed them in the old copper tub out back, and hung them on a line strung between the two apple trees, where they billowed in the breeze like prayer flags. Each task was an act of reclamation, a quiet conversation with the spirit of the place, erasing the neglect and making it hers once more.

Her greatest challenge, and greatest triumph, was the old iron stove. It was a formidable black beast that dominated the kitchen, a relic from an era before digital temperature displays and fan-forced consistency. Liina remembered her grandmother tending to it with an almost telepathic understanding, knowing by the scent of the wood and the colour of the flame precisely when it was ready for a delicate cake or a slow-roasting joint. Her first attempt to light it ended in a plume of acrid smoke that filled the kitchen and sent her, coughing, out into the garden. Undeterred, she consulted the journal. Tucked into the back pocket was a loose sheet of paper filled with Vanaema Elvi’s notes, not a recipe, but a guide to the stove itself. *‘The old man needs a gentle hand and dry birch. Do not rush him. Listen for the deep hum, not the angry roar.’* Following the cryptic instructions, she tried again, feeding it small, dry pieces of birch from the woodshed. This time, after a few false starts, a clean flame caught, and soon the stove settled into a low, contented hum, radiating a deep, penetrating warmth that filled the entire cottage. It felt like restarting the house’s heart.

With the kitchen alive and warm, she turned her attention to the pantry that was the wild garden. She took a wicker basket and a small, sharp knife and stepped out into the morning dew. The sheer abundance was overwhelming. She started with the rhubarb, its crimson stalks thick and firm beneath the giant leaves. She harvested a dozen, their tart, earthy smell sharp and clean. Creeping along the old stone wall, she hunted for wild strawberries, a treasure hunt that rewarded patience. The berries were tiny, no bigger than her littlest fingernail, but their flavour was a concentrated explosion of sunshine and sweetness, a world away from their pallid, water-logged cousins in the supermarket. As she worked, she felt the pressure of the competition, the need for perfection, fall away. This was not about performance; it was about participation in a cycle of growth and harvest that had been turning in this very spot for generations.

Back in the warm kitchen, she didn’t consult a recipe. She worked from memory, from muscle and instinct. She chopped the rhubarb, tossing it with a handful of sugar and a scrape of ginger she’d brought from Tallinn. For the topping, she rubbed cold butter into flour and oats, her fingers remembering the familiar motion. She slid the crumble into the stove’s oven, not setting a timer, but trusting her senses—the smell of the fruit bubbling and the topping turning golden, the way her grandmother had taught her. When she pulled it out, its top a rugged, toasted landscape, the whole house was filled with a scent so deeply comforting it was almost heartbreaking. She ate it straight from the dish, standing at the counter, the sharp tang of the rhubarb balanced by the sweet, buttery crumble. It was simple, rustic, and utterly perfect. It tasted of home.

A few days into her stay, a knock came at the front door. It was an elderly man with a kind, weathered face and hands as gnarled as the roots of an old oak. He held out a small paper bag. "I saw the smoke," he said, his voice a low, pleasant rumble. "I am Toomas, your neighbour from over the ridge. Elvi and I, we were friends since childhood. I brought you some fresh-caught flounder. She always said it was best fried in butter." Liina, momentarily speechless, accepted the gift. "Thank you," she managed. "I'm Liina. Her granddaughter." A warm smile spread across Toomas's face. "I know. You have her eyes. It is good to see life in this house again. It has been too quiet." He peered past her into the front room. "Smells right, too. She was always baking. This whole lane would smell of cardamom or cinnamon. A person couldn’t walk by without their stomach growling. She shared everything, you know. A loaf of bread for a sick neighbour, a slice of cake for a child with a scraped knee. Her kitchen was the village’s second heart."

The conversation with Toomas cemented what Liina was beginning to understand. The recipes in the journal were more than instructions; they were records of a currency of kindness. Her grandmother’s baking had been an integral part of the fabric of this community, a way of marking time, celebrating joys, and soothing sorrows. When Liina sat down at the pine table that evening, the old journal open on her left, the new notebook open on her right, her purpose felt clearer than ever. She wasn't just writing a cookbook; she was preserving an ethnography of comfort. Her pen hovered over the page as she tried to capture it all. She didn’t start with ingredients. She started with a story. *‘Vanaema Elvi believed that a cake could be a bandage for a scraped knee or a balm for a bruised heart. Her Kringel, a sweet, plaited wreath of cardamom-scented dough, was her most versatile prescription. She made it for christenings and funerals, for coffee with friends and for solitary afternoons. The secret, she always said, was not in the flour or the yeast, but in kneading your own good wishes into the dough.’*

The words came, but not always easily. The quiet of the cottage, so peaceful at first, sometimes became a vast, echoing space for her own insecurities to fill. One afternoon, she attempted one of her grandmother’s more ambitious recipes: a layered rye bread that required a wild yeast starter, a notoriously temperamental thing. She followed the instructions, but the starter seemed sluggish, and the final loaf, when she pulled it from the oven, was a dense, heavy brick. Frustration, sharp and familiar, pricked at her. She stared at the failed loaf, and her gaze drifted to the trophy, which she’d placed on the mantelpiece. In the rustic, humble cottage, it looked absurdly ostentatious, a gaudy bauble from another life. The doubt crept in, cold and insidious. Was she a fraud? A one-trick pony who had gotten lucky with a single cake? The pressure of the book deal, of the expectation, felt like a physical weight on her shoulders. Perhaps she wasn’t a true baker at all, just a student who had memorized one good performance.

She left the failed bread on the counter and walked out into the wild garden as the evening light softened the edges of the world. She sank down onto an old stone bench, the cool stone a comfort against her legs. She wasn't a failure. She was a learner. Her grandmother hadn't been born with this knowledge; she had earned it through decades of trial and error, of burnt crusts and sunken cakes in this very kitchen. The journal wasn’t a holy text of infallible instructions; it was a map of that journey, and failures were a necessary part of the terrain. This rye bread hadn't worked not because she was a fraud, but because her starter wasn't ready, because the air was too cool, because she didn't yet know the specific language of this oven, this flour, this water. She went back inside, not with a sense of defeat, but with a renewed, calmer determination. She cut a slice from the dense loaf. It was heavy, but the flavour was there, deep and tangy. It wasn't a triumph, but it wasn't a total loss. She spread it with fresh butter and ate it slowly, a small communion with her own imperfection. The next day, she would feed the starter again. She would try again. She would listen more closely. The work was just beginning.The summer deepened, ripening the island from the bright green of June to the dusty gold of August. Liina’s life settled into a rhythm guided not by the clock, but by the sun, the tides, and the needs of the wild garden. Mornings began with a walk to the sea, a thermos of strong tea in hand, her bare feet tracing the cool, damp sand at the water’s edge. She learned to read the sky for signs of rain and the wind for the shift in seasons. Her days were spent in a slow, rewarding cycle of labour: tending to the burgeoning vegetable patch she had carved from the weeds, foraging in the forest for chanterelles that glowed like fallen lamps on the mossy ground, and, most of all, working in the warm, fragrant heart of the cottage—the kitchen. The scarred pine table became her universe, a landscape of flour-dusted notebooks, bowls of vibrant berries, old black-and-white photographs of her grandparents, and jars of herbs in various states of drying.

Translating her vanaema’s journal into a modern cookbook was far more complex than simply transcribing recipes. It was an act of culinary archaeology. Her grandmother’s instructions were often maddeningly esoteric, a private language developed over a lifetime. “A handful of sugar,” “enough milk to make it sing,” or “bake until the smell tells you it is done.” Liina spent an entire week trying to decipher the recipe for Vanaema Elvi’s legendary poppyseed roll. The journal’s instructions were a mere four lines of elegant, spidery script. Her first two attempts were disasters: one a dry, crumbly log, the other a soggy mess from which the filling oozed in a sad, grey puddle. She was ready to give up, convinced the magic was untranslatable, when she found a faint, greasy fingerprint next to the ingredient list. Looking closer, she saw a nearly invisible note in the margin: *‘Like the first wet snow.’* The phrase unlocked something in her mind. She wasn't making a dough; she was recreating a texture, a feeling. On her third try, she ignored her measuring cups and focused on the feel of the dough in her hands, adding the milk drop by drop until it felt cool, soft, and yielding, like the heavy, wet snow of early winter. The resulting roll was perfect, and as she wrote the recipe in her own notebook, she included not just the grams and millilitres, but the story of the fingerprint and the poetic, crucial clue.

Her quiet hermitage was gradually punctuated by the small kindnesses of the community. Toomas, the neighbour, became a regular visitor, often appearing at the back door with a gift of fresh eggs or a particularly fine head of cabbage, his visits always accompanied by a new story about Elvi. “She could tell if a storm was coming by the way the dough for her rye bread rose,” he told Liina one afternoon, accepting a thick slice of the poppyseed roll. "Said the air got heavy and pressed it down." These anecdotes became as vital to the cookbook as the ingredient lists, weaving a tapestry of folklore and practical wisdom around the recipes. Liina, in turn, began to reciprocate. A warm loaf of bread left on Toomas's porch, a small jar of wild strawberry jam for the woman at the tiny village shop, a few slices of crumble for the postman. She was, without consciously trying, stepping into the role her grandmother had occupied, her baking once again becoming a currency of connection, a silent language of care spoken across fences and down gravel lanes.

One bright Friday, the island’s deep peace was joyfully shattered by the arrival of Kaisa. She tumbled out of the island’s only taxi like a whirlwind of city energy, dressed in fashionable black jeans and a band t-shirt that looked starkly urban against the backdrop of rustling pines. She carried a tote bag overflowing with gossip magazines, a bottle of expensive gin, and a bag of gourmet coffee beans. "My God, Liina, it's a hundred years in the past!" she declared, surveying the rustic cottage with wide, incredulous eyes. "There's no signal! I had to ask a sheep for directions! Are you happy here? Have you started wearing homespun linen and communicating with birds?" Liina just laughed, hugging her friend fiercely, the familiar scent of Kaisa’s citrusy perfume a startling, welcome intrusion.

Kaisa’s visit was a collision of two worlds. The law student, accustomed to all-night study sessions fueled by takeout and espresso, was baffled by the slow, deliberate pace of Liina’s life. She watched, fascinated, as Liina carefully fed her sourdough starter, explaining that it was the great-great-grandchild of a starter her vanaema had been given on her wedding day. She followed Liina into the garden to pick vegetables for their dinner, tentatively touching the velvety leaves of a zucchini plant as if it were an exotic creature. “You just… grow food?” Kaisa asked, her tone a mixture of awe and disbelief. "In Tallinn, food is something that appears in a plastic container via a courier on a scooter." That evening, as they sat at the pine table eating a simple, delicious meal of flounder fried in butter (a gift from Toomas), roasted new potatoes, and a salad made from greens picked just an hour before, Kaisa fell quiet. "Okay," she said finally, putting down her fork. "I get it. I totally get it. This tastes… real. My soul has been surviving on photocopies of flavour and this is the original manuscript."

The visit culminated in a joint baking project. Liina decided to teach Kaisa how to make the simple oat and rhubarb crumble that had been her own first success in the cottage. Kaisa, a self-proclaimed disaster in the kitchen, approached the task with a mixture of terror and theatrical enthusiasm. She measured the flour as if it were a volatile chemical, spilled sugar all over the floor, and rubbed the butter into the oats with such ferocity that she ended up with more on her clothes than in the bowl. But through it all, they laughed, their easy camaraderie filling the small kitchen with a warmth that rivaled the old iron stove. As Kaisa proudly pulled their lopsided but gloriously fragrant crumble from the oven, her face flushed with triumph, Liina saw a flicker of the same joy of creation that had captivated her. She was not just hoarding her grandmother’s legacy; she was sharing it, passing it on, proving that its magic could be sparked even in the most unlikely of hands.

When Kaisa left two days later, her taxi kicking up a cloud of dust on the gravel lane, the cottage felt quiet but not empty. Her friend’s visit had been more than a pleasant distraction; it had been a validation. It had held a mirror up to Liina’s new life and reflected back not eccentricity or regression, but a quiet, powerful authenticity. That afternoon, an email arrived from her editor in Tallinn. It was feedback on the first chapter she had submitted, the one that began with the story of the Kringel. Liina’s hands trembled slightly as she opened it. The email was short and to the point. “Liina, this is wonderful. It’s exactly what we hoped for, and more. The voice is so warm and personal, and the blend of recipe, memory, and folklore is enchanting. Don’t change a thing. We’re already excited to design the cover. Keep going.” She read the email three times, the words a soothing balm on the lingering sting of her old insecurities. She looked from the screen, out the window to the wild garden where the last of the sun was turning the tangled leaves to gold, and then to the two journals, old and new, sitting side-by-side on the table. The path ahead was long, but for the first time, she felt with absolute certainty that she was walking in the right direction.As the sun slanted lower in the sky each day, autumn arrived on Hiiumaa not as a sudden event, but as a slow, deliberate watercolour bleed. The fierce greens of summer softened, and the sprawling forests at the edge of the meadows began to smoulder with colour, first a flicker of yellow in the birch leaves, then a blaze of crimson in the wild creepers that snaked up the stone walls. The air grew crisp, carrying the damp, earthy scent of fallen leaves and the distant, briny tang of a colder sea. Liina felt the change not just in the air, but in her bones. The frantic energy of summer’s growth gave way to a quieter, more focused drive to gather, prepare, and store. The island was getting ready for the long, dark sleep of winter, and Liina, now fully attuned to its rhythms, found herself doing the same.

The epicentre of this seasonal shift was the pair of ancient apple trees in the garden. For months they had been quiet, leafy guardians, but now they were heavy with fruit, their gnarled branches bowing low under the weight of their own generosity. The apples were a motley crew, nothing like the uniform, waxed globes of the city supermarkets. Some were small, green, and sharp, perfect for sauce; others were large and streaked with red, their flesh crisp and honey-sweet. Liina knew, from summers spent trailing her grandmother, that this was a windfall that could not be wasted. It was the island’s last great gift before the frost, and it demanded respect. The kitchen transformed into a preservation workshop, the air growing thick and sweet with the scent of cinnamon, cloves, and slowly simmering fruit. The iron stove, her once-intimidating adversary, was now a trusted partner, its steady, radiant heat working its slow magic through the day and into the night.

Following the stained, annotated pages in the journal, Liina learned the old ways. She filled dozens of glass jars with rosy apple sauce. She made pots of dark, fragrant apple butter, simmering it for hours until it was the consistency of thick velvet. She spent an entire afternoon sitting on the back step with a knife and a bowl of water, coring and slicing apples into thin rings. She threaded them onto long strings with a darning needle, just as she’d seen her vanaema do, and hung them in the warm, dry space above the stove. The drying apple rings filled the cottage with a concentrated, sweet-tart perfume, a ghostly echo of the summer sun being stored away for the dark months ahead. Each jar sealed with a satisfying pop, each string of drying fruit, felt like a victory against the coming winter, a tangible form of hope and security. This, she wrote in her notebook late one night, her fingers sticky with sugar, was what her grandmother’s baking was truly about: not just pleasure, but provision. It was a form of love that was practical and enduring, a way of saying ‘I will care for you, even when the world outside is cold and barren.’

It was during her search for more preserving jars that she made the discovery. In the cool, dim attic, tucked away under the eaves behind a stack of old fishing nets, was a small, sea-worn wooden chest, the kind a sailor might have once owned. It wasn’t locked. Liina lifted the heavy lid, expecting to find more household linens or perhaps old tools. Instead, she found letters. Bundles of them, dozens and dozens, tied with faded, brittle ribbon. The paper was thin and fragile, the ink faded in places to a ghostly brown. The handwriting on the envelopes was her grandfather’s, a strong, forward-slanting script, addressed to Vanaema Elvi at this very cottage. The postmarks dated from the 1950s. Her grandfather, Heino, had been a long-haul fisherman, away at sea for months at a time. Liina sat on the dusty floorboards of the attic, the scent of dried wood and old paper filling her senses, and began to read.

The letters were a window into a world she had only ever heard about in stories. Heino wrote of the vast, lonely emptiness of the North Atlantic, of storms that turned the sea into a thrashing grey monster, of the strange, foreign ports he visited. But mostly, he wrote of home. He wrote not of grand passions, but of a deep, abiding ache of homesickness that he tried to soothe by picturing the details of his life on Hiiumaa. *‘Did the late roses bloom by the wall this year?’* he asked in one letter. *‘Tell me, is the new well drawing sweet water? I try to imagine it. I am tired of the taste of salt.’* And in almost every letter, he asked about the garden, about the food. *‘I dream of your fish soup. The stuff they serve on this ship tastes of tin and despair.’* Then Liina found the letter that made her stop breathing. It was dated in late September. *‘The apples must be ripe by now,’* her grandfather had written. *‘I can almost taste the first pie of the season, the one you make with extra cinnamon. When you take it from the stove, stand by the open door for a moment and send the smell out over the water. Perhaps the wind will carry it to me. It is a foolish thought, I know, but it makes me feel closer to you.’*

Tucked into the bundle was one of Elvi’s rare replies, which she must have given him to take on his next voyage. Her script was the same elegant, spidery hand that filled the recipe journal. *‘My dearest Heino,’* it began. *‘The house is too quiet without the sound of your boots on the floor. I made the first apple pie today. The whole kitchen smells of you, of autumn, of home. I did as you asked. I held it in the doorway and thought of you, out on the cold sea. I hope you felt it. I am saving you a slice, and I am saving all my stories to tell you when you return. Come home safe.’* Liina sat in the dusty silence of the attic, tears blurring the faded ink. This was the missing ingredient, the secret that wasn’t written in the journal. The food wasn’t just about comfort or community; it was a lifeline. It was a language of love and longing sent across impossible distances. It was a way of holding a family together when the sea was trying to pull it apart. Her grandmother hadn't just been baking a pie; she had been sending a message, a prayer, an anchor to hold her husband fast and guide him home.

That evening, the work at the kitchen table felt different, more sacred. Liina carefully untied one of the ribbons and laid out the letters from that long-ago autumn next to her own notes. She took the chapter she had started, titled ‘The Apple Harvest,’ and she crossed out the title. She wrote a new one: ‘A Message Across the Sea.’ She began to write not about techniques or measurements, but about a young woman standing in a doorway, holding a pie like a beacon. She wrote about the ache of loneliness and the defiant power of a familiar taste. The recipes for apple sauce, for apple butter, for the pie with extra cinnamon, became part of this larger story, each one an act of love, a spell against absence. Her own voice, which she had fought so hard to find, now blended seamlessly with the voices of her grandparents, creating a narrative that was richer and more resonant than anything she could have imagined. The cookbook was no longer just her grandmother's legacy. It was her entire family's. It was her own. She was not just a baker. She was a storyteller, a keeper of the flame, the custodian of a love story told in butter and sugar and spice.The first storm of winter arrived without preamble, a sudden, violent assault after a week of deceptively calm grey skies. Liina woke in the pre-dawn darkness not to the gentle chirping of birds, but to the furious howl of the wind tearing through the pine forest. It was a primal sound, a deep-throated roar that seemed to come from the belly of the earth. The little cottage, which had felt so sturdy and solid all summer, suddenly seemed fragile, a tiny wooden shell adrift in a turbulent sea of sound. Rain, driven almost horizontal by the gales, hammered against the windowpanes with the relentless rhythm of a frantic drum. She lay in bed, listening to the old house groan and shudder, the rafters creaking like the timbers of a ship at sea, and felt not fear, but a strange sense of exhilaration. The island was showing its true, wild face, and she was safely tucked into its heart.

Her world shrank to the four walls of the cottage, her days dictated by the needs of the stove. Keeping it fed with dry birch became her primary occupation, its radiant heat a defiant bubble of warmth and life against the raging elements. The world outside the windows dissolved into a churning, abstract canvas of grey and white. With nowhere to go and nothing to do but wait out the storm, she turned all her energy to the book. The kitchen table, now permanently lit by the warm glow of an oil lamp, became her entire world. The letters, which she had handled so gingerly at first, were now her constant companions, their fragile pages spread out amongst her own notes. She lived within their correspondence, her waking hours steeped in the quiet drama of her grandparents’ long-distance love. She saw her grandmother’s recipes not as standalone instructions, but as direct answers to her grandfather’s unspoken needs.

A letter from Heino, postmarked from a bleak port in northern Scotland, described the endless, monotonous diet of boiled fish and potatoes. *‘My tongue has forgotten all other flavours,’* he wrote, his strong script looking tired on the page. *‘Sometimes I close my eyes and try to remember the taste of your roasted pork with the caraway seeds. The memory is sharp, but it only makes the next meal of grey fish harder to swallow.’* Beside the letter, Liina placed her vanaema’s journal, open to a recipe for *Ahjuliha*, oven-roasted pork, annotated with a fierce little note: *‘Use plenty of caraway. It warms the soul.’* Writing the chapter, Liina described how to score the fat, how to rub the salt and spices deep into the meat, framing the instructions as an act of defiant care, a way to send flavour and warmth across a cold, indifferent ocean. She was building a bridge of words and memory, linking the loneliness of a fisherman to the fierce, creative love of the woman waiting for him on shore.

On the second day of the storm, a heavy, thumping knock rattled the back door. Liina jumped, startled. Through the rain-streaked glass, she saw the broad, stoic silhouette of Toomas, wrapped in a thick oilskin coat, his face ruddy from the wind. She unbolted the door and he stomped inside, bringing a gust of cold, wet air with him. He held up a string bag containing a few large, knobbly potatoes and a thick wedge of smoked bacon. "The wind is a madman today," he boomed, unwrapping the scarf from his neck. "Thought you might be low on supplies. A storm like this is no time to be alone with an empty larder." His presence filled the small kitchen, his calm solidity a reassuring anchor in the chaos of the weather. Liina, overwhelmed by the simple, profound kindness, could only gesture towards the stove.

She made them a simple, fortifying lunch: a thick soup with the potatoes and bacon he’d brought, seasoned with herbs from her drying rack, and served with thick slices of the dense rye bread she had finally, after several attempts, managed to perfect. They ate at the kitchen table, the storm raging outside, the oil lamp casting a warm, intimate glow on their faces. Toomas pointed a thumb towards the letters spread across the table. "Heino's letters," he said, his voice softer. "I remember when they would arrive. The postman knew to bring them straight here, no matter the weather. Your grandmother would read them, and then she would cook. Always. If he was sad, she would bake something sweet. If he wrote of storms, she would make a hearty soup, as if she could send him strength through the stove. This house was never more full of good smells than when Heino was far away at sea." He looked at Liina, his old eyes clear and direct. "It is good that you are writing it all down. These stories… they are like seeds. They look like nothing, but if you plant them right, they can feed a person for a long time."

His words settled deep in Liina’s heart, a final, crucial piece of encouragement. After he left, trudging back out into the wind, Liina felt a new resolve. The cookbook was more than a collection of recipes and stories; it was an almanac of resilience, a manual for how to survive the winter, both literal and metaphorical. Inspired, she turned to the back of her vanaema's journal, to the section marked *‘Jõulud’*—Christmas. There she found the recipe for a legendary dark, fruit-and-spice-laden cake, a *Jõulukook* that was only ever made once a year. The recipe was complex, calling for dried fruits she had already prepared, nuts, a host of spices, and a shocking amount of dark rum. The final instruction read: *‘Bake low and slow, for as long as it takes. This is not a cake for rushing. It is a cake for waiting. It tastes best after a week, when all the flavours have had time to meet and marry.’*

As the storm continued to howl, Liina began the ritual. She chopped the candied peel and dried apples, her knife a steady rhythm against the wooden board. She toasted the walnuts in a dry pan on the stove, their scent mingling with the ever-present smell of woodsmoke. She measured out the dark, sticky molasses and the fragrant spices—cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger—a litany of warmth and light. She mixed it all together in her largest earthenware bowl, her arms aching with the effort of stirring the thick, heavy batter. It felt less like baking and more like casting a spell, a potent charm against the darkness and the cold. When she slid the heavy cake tin into the gentle, constant heat of the oven, she felt she was entrusting it not just with flour and fruit, but with all the stories of love, longing, and endurance she had unearthed. Hours later, a deep, rich, spicy-sweet fragrance filled every corner of the cottage, a scent so powerful it seemed to push back against the storm itself. It was the smell of patience, of memory, and of a promise that even after the longest, darkest night, there would eventually be light and celebration.The storm broke as suddenly as it had arrived. Liina awoke one morning to a profound and unfamiliar silence, the absence of the wind’s roar leaving a vacuum in the air. She pushed herself out of the warm bed and went to the window. The world outside was reborn, scoured clean and glittering under a pale, watery sun. The sky was a vast, fragile blue, streaked with high, white clouds. Every pine needle, every blade of grass, was encased in a jewel-like droplet of water that caught the light. A large branch had fallen from one of the apple trees, a testament to the storm’s fury, but the little cottage stood unscathed, its grey walls looking warm and steadfast in the clean morning light. Liina wrapped herself in a thick woollen jumper and stepped outside, breathing in the cold, ozonic air. A sense of deep, quiet strength settled over her, the feeling of having weathered something immense and come out whole on the other side.

Back in the humming warmth of the kitchen, she attended to the Christmas cake. The long, slow bake was complete. With thick oven mitts, she carefully drew the heavy tin from the depths of the stove. The cake itself was not beautiful in a conventional way; it was almost black, its surface craggy and dense, studded with the dark gleam of fruits. But the aroma that rose from it was magnificent, a complex tapestry of sweet, spicy, and boozy notes that spoke of time and transformation. Following the final instructions in the journal, she let it cool completely before turning it out onto a clean linen cloth. She took the bottle of dark rum and generously doused the cloth, the spirit soaking into the white fabric, then she wrapped the cake up tight, like a precious child being swaddled for a long journey. The journal said to store it in a cool, dark tin for at least two weeks, but preferably a month. Liina placed the wrapped cake into a large biscuit tin and stored it in the cool pantry. The cake, like the book, needed time for its disparate elements to meld, to deepen, to become something more than the sum of their parts.

With the storm gone, the days grew shorter and the light more precious, and Liina’s work took on a new, focused intensity. The fragmented stories, recipes, and memories began to coalesce into a single, cohesive narrative. The letters and the journal were no longer separate artifacts; they were entwined, two parts of a single harmony, with her own voice acting as the conductor. She wrote through the long, quiet afternoons and deep into the lamp-lit nights, losing all track of time, the outside world fading to a distant rumour. The physical act of writing became a comfort, the scratch of her pen on the paper a counterpoint to the quiet hum of the house. Finally, one evening, as a sliver of moon rose over the dark forest, she wrote the last sentence of the last chapter. She gathered the scattered pages—a thick, unruly stack of handwritten sheets, typed-up sections, and annotated recipes—and squared them into a pile on the table. It was heavy. It was real. A wave of emotion, so potent it made her dizzy, washed over her. It was a terrifying cocktail of pride, relief, and a profound new vulnerability. Everything she was, everything she had learned and felt in this house, was contained in that stack of paper.

The outside world made its return via a crackling, intermittent phone signal she managed to catch by standing on the old stone wall at the edge of the property. A cascade of notifications flooded her phone, but it was an email from Eva, her editor, that she opened first. Eva had received the new chapter, ‘A Message Across the Sea,’ and her response was effusive. "Liina, this is breathtaking," she wrote. "You've taken this from a cookbook to a memoir, a love story. This is the soul of the book. I was in tears by the end. We need to plan the photography around this feeling, this authenticity. Could you come to Tallinn in a fortnight? The photographer and I want to meet with you, to create a visual language that does justice to your words and your grandmother's legacy." The praise was a relief, but the request sent a jolt of anxiety through her. Tallinn. A meeting. Photographers and art directors. It all sounded so loud, so polished, so antithetical to the quiet, organic process she had cultivated. She felt a fierce, protective instinct rise in her. She had to go. She couldn't let them turn her family’s story into a set of glossy, soulless images. She had to be there to be its guardian.

The day before she was due to leave for the mainland, she decided the time had come. It had been three weeks. The Christmas cake was ready. She walked over to Toomas's cottage, her boots crunching on the first light frost of the season, and invited him for coffee. When he arrived, stomping the cold from his feet on her doorstep, the kitchen was already warm and filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee. The moment felt ceremonial. Liina retrieved the tin from the pantry and placed it on the table. She carefully unwrapped the rum-soaked cloth, and the air filled with a scent so rich and complex it was almost overwhelming: dark fruit, warm spice, aged rum, and something else, something deeper—the smell of patience. The cake was dark, moist, and impossibly dense. With one of her vanaema’s silver-handled knives, she cut two thin slices. She placed one on a plate for Toomas and one for herself and they ate in companionable silence, the only sound the ticking of the old clock on the wall. The flavour was extraordinary. It was a celebration on the tongue, each bite revealing a new layer—the sweetness of the raisins, the slight bitterness of the candied peel, the warmth of the ginger, the deep, resonant hum of the rum. It tasted nothing like the sum of its ingredients; it tasted of a cold night, a warm fire, and a long wait finally coming to an end. Toomas finished his slice, set down his fork, and took a sip of his coffee. He looked at Liina, a slow, genuine smile spreading across his weathered face. "Yes," he said, his voice a low rumble of approval. "That is Elvi's cake. That is the taste of winter."

Packing felt strange, an act of temporary farewell. The cottage was no longer a refuge from the world, but her anchor in it. As she folded her clothes, her gaze kept drifting around the room, noting the small changes that had made it her own: the jar of wildflowers on the windowsill, the stack of books by her bed, the faint dusting of flour that seemed to coat every surface. On the mantelpiece, the *Vabariigi Maiasmokk* trophy glinted in the pale light. She looked at it for a moment, a relic from a life that felt like it belonged to someone else. Her real prize was the thick, heavy manuscript she carefully placed in her bag, nestled right beside the worn leather of her grandmother’s journal. The journey to Tallinn this time was not an escape or a return, but a mission. She was travelling not as a competitor or a student, but as an emissary, carrying the quiet, resilient soul of her island, her family, and her kitchen, ready to share its story with the world.The return to Tallinn was a sensory shock. Stepping off the ferry was like diving headfirst from a quiet lake into a roaring, turbulent river. The air, thin and sharp on the island, was thick here with the exhaust of buses, the competing smells of roasted nuts from a street vendor and perfume from a passing crowd, and the underlying hum of a million lives being lived at once. The gentle, rhythmic sounds of wind and sea were replaced by a cacophony of traffic, distant sirens, and the staccato chatter of a city that never held its breath. Liina clutched the strap of her duffel bag, the heavy manuscript inside a solid, reassuring weight against her side. She felt like a time traveller, her internal clock still set to the slow, deliberate rhythm of the seasons, while the world around her moved at a frantic, dizzying pace.

Kaisa met her at the flat, enveloping her in a hug that smelled of coffee and law books. “You’re back!” she exclaimed, holding Liina at arm’s length. “Look at you! Your face has actual colour in it that isn’t from sheer panic. And you smell of… woodsmoke? And apples? My God, you’ve become a full-on forest nymph.” The flat, which had once felt like her entire world, now seemed impossibly small and cluttered. Liina’s gaze fell on the stacks of art history books, the worn sofa, the familiar print of the Tallinn skyline. It was her life, but it felt like a photograph of a life she used to lead. Kaisa, ever perceptive, noticed her friend’s quiet abstraction. “It’s weird being back, isn’t it?” she asked, her voice softening. Liina nodded. “It’s loud,” she said simply, and Kaisa understood completely.

The next morning, Liina walked to the offices of Kirjastus Varrak. Located in a repurposed brick warehouse in the trendy Kalamaja district, the publisher’s headquarters was a temple of modern Estonian design. Inside, behind a stark glass façade, was a soaring open-plan space with polished concrete floors, white walls, and minimalist Scandinavian furniture. Young, stylishly dressed people moved with quiet, focused energy, their faces illuminated by the glow of sleek laptops. It was a world away from the scarred pine and faded floral prints of the Hiiumaa cottage. Liina, dressed in her best wool jumper, sturdy boots, and a simple skirt, felt like a rustic curiosity, a piece of driftwood washed up in a pristine art gallery.

Eva, her editor, greeted her with a warm smile that instantly put her at ease. She was a chic woman in her forties with sharp, intelligent eyes. “Liina, it’s so wonderful to see you. We are all so captivated by what you’ve sent.” She led Liina to a glass-walled meeting room where a man was setting up a projector. “This is Rasmus, our photographer. He’s one of the best.” Rasmus was a few years older than Liina, with a carefully curated artist-in-the-city look: a black turtleneck, fashionable glasses, and an air of intense, slightly impatient creativity. He shook her hand briefly, his eyes already assessing her as a subject. “Good to meet you,” he said, his voice brisk. “Eva’s been raving. I’ve put together a few initial thoughts for the look and feel.”

He clicked a button, and the wall lit up with an image. It was a stunning photograph: a single, perfect slice of dark, glossy chocolate cake on a slab of black slate, artfully dusted with cocoa, a single, perfect raspberry placed just so with a pair of tweezers. The lighting was dramatic, moody, full of shadow. It looked like a piece of modern sculpture. He clicked again. A deconstructed pavlova, its meringue shards scattered across a stark concrete surface like shattered ice. Another click. A loaf of rustic bread, but shot with such high contrast that every crack and fissure looked like a canyon in a desolate landscape. It was technically brilliant, undeniably beautiful, and completely, utterly wrong. A cold knot of dread formed in Liina’s stomach. This was her nightmare: her grandmother’s warm, generous, life-giving food turned into cold, architectural still life.

“The aesthetic is very ‘New Nordic Noir’,” Rasmus explained, warming to his theme. “It’s clean, it’s dramatic, it elevates the food to art. It’s what’s selling right now. We highlight the texture, the form. It’s sophisticated, adult.” Liina listened, her heart sinking with each word. She glanced at Eva, who was watching her carefully, a question in her eyes. This was the moment. She could nod, be polite, and let her book be steamrollered into a fashionable package that would betray its every word. Or she could speak. She thought of Toomas saying her grandmother’s baking could heal a scraped knee, of her grandfather’s desperate plea for the smell of apple pie to be sent across the sea. None of that was here, in these cold, perfect images.

She took a deep breath, the scent of woodsmoke still clinging faintly to her jumper. “Thank you, Rasmus. These are beautiful photographs,” she began, her voice quiet but firm, cutting through his confident presentation. “But they are not my book.” Rasmus stopped, his finger hovering over the mouse, an expression of surprise and a hint of irritation on his face. “My book,” Liina continued, her courage growing as she spoke, “is not about clean lines and dramatic shadows. It’s about warmth. It’s about a crowded kitchen table, and flour on your sleeve, and the steam rising from a cup of tea. It’s about the knife marks on a wooden board. It’s… it’s messy. It has to be.” She reached into her duffel bag, her hands bypassing the manuscript. She pulled out two things and placed them on the gleaming white conference table. The first was a small, preserving jar of her wild strawberry jam, its colour a deep, imperfect ruby red. The second was one of her grandfather’s letters, the paper thin and browned with age, its creases as deep as wrinkles.

“This is the aesthetic,” she said, her voice gaining passion. “The colour of this jam isn’t uniform because the strawberries weren’t uniform. Some grew in the sun, some in the shade. That’s part of the story. And this letter… this is the seasoning. This is why the food matters. It’s not about how it looks on a slab of slate. It’s about how it feels to someone who is cold and far from home. Can you photograph that? Can you photograph the feeling of a promise kept?” For a long moment, the room was silent. Rasmus stared at the small, humble objects on the table, then back at his slick, projected images. He looked as if he was about to argue, to defend his professional vision. But then he looked at the letter, at the faded, elegant handwriting. He picked it up, his touch surprisingly gentle, and read a few lines, his brow furrowed. He put it down and looked at Liina, really looked at her, and his artist’s gaze shifted from assessment to inquiry. “The house,” he said slowly. “The one you write about. It’s real?” “Yes,” Liina replied. “I’ve been living there for six months.”

Rasmus leaned back in his chair, staring at the ceiling as if seeing a whole new set of images projected there. “We can’t do it here,” he said, almost to himself. “We can’t build a set that feels like that. The light will be wrong. The surfaces will be too clean. The ghosts won’t be there.” He suddenly leaned forward, his eyes alive with a new, frantic energy. “Eva, we have to shoot on location. On the island. In the cottage. We use natural light. We use the real plates, the real table, the real stove. We don't style it, we document it. We shoot the chipped mug, the worn floorboards, the jam bubbling on the stove. We photograph the story, not the food.” Eva blinked, surprised by his sudden reversal, but a slow smile spread across her face as she saw the excitement in both their eyes. “The budget…” she started, but Rasmus waved a dismissive hand. “We’ll make it work. It’s a better idea. It’s a truer book.” He looked at Liina, his earlier professional coolness gone, replaced by the genuine excitement of a collaborator. “Your book isn’t Nordic Noir,” he said, a grin touching his lips. “It’s… Baltic Soul. And it’s going to be beautiful.” Liina felt a wave of relief so profound it almost buckled her knees. She hadn’t just been heard; she had been understood. The soul of her book was safe.The weeks leading up to the photoshoot were a flurry of logistical planning that felt strangely distant to Liina, who remained on the island. Eva handled the details from Tallinn—ferry tickets, accommodation for the small crew, rental equipment—while Liina prepared the cottage, seeing it now through the eyes of a location scout. She polished the old copper pots until they shone with a deep, rosy lustre. She washed and ironed her vanaema’s best linen tablecloths, their faint scent of lavender filling the air. She didn’t scrub away the character—the knife marks on the table and the heat-stain by the stove remained—but she curated the space, readying it for its close-up. She felt a nervous flutter, the same feeling as before a dinner party, a desire for her home to be seen and loved for what it was. Her primary task, however, was preparing a detailed shooting schedule, a list of recipes organized by the quality of light they required. Delicate meringues needed the soft, even light of a cloudy morning; a rich, dark stew would be best captured in the warm, long shadows of late afternoon. She was already beginning to think visually, translating taste and emotion into light and composition.

The arrival of the team felt like a gentle invasion. A white rental van, looking absurdly clean and modern, crunched down the gravel track and parked beside the apple trees. Out stepped Rasmus, looking even more urban than he had in the office, his black-clad figure a stark exclamation point against the muted greens and greys of the landscape. With him was a young, quiet assistant named Anni, whose job was to manage the equipment. Rasmus’s first tour of the cottage was a study in professional assessment mixed with barely concealed culture shock. He ran a hand over the rough-hewn wall planks, peered into the dark maw of the iron stove, and tested the rustic plumbing with a raised eyebrow. “The light in here is… challenging,” he murmured, his photographer’s eye dissecting the space into pools of shadow and shafts of sun. “But it’s real. We’ll make it work.” Anni began unloading case after case of expensive equipment—lenses, tripods, reflectors, a laptop—the gleaming black metal and plastic looking like alien artifacts on the worn wooden floor.

The first day of shooting was a lesson in forced patience for Rasmus. He was accustomed to the controlled environment of a studio, where light could be manufactured and every variable tamed. Here, he was at the mercy of the island’s whims. He set up an elaborate shot of Liina kneading rye bread dough on the pine table, only for the sun to disappear behind a thick bank of cloud, plunging the kitchen into a gloomy twilight. “We’ve lost the light!” he exclaimed in frustration, running a hand through his hair. Liina, unfazed, simply covered the dough with a damp cloth. “It’s fine,” she said calmly. “The dough needs to rest anyway. This is how it really is. Baking is mostly waiting.” She made them all a pot of tea, and as they sat in the enforced quiet, listening to the wind sighing outside, Rasmus began to relax. He started to see what Liina saw: that the waiting was part of the process, that the shifting light wasn't a problem to be solved but a character in the story. When the sun re-emerged an hour later, the light was softer, more beautiful, and the dough had risen perfectly. The resulting pictures were better than anything he could have manufactured.

Their collaboration truly began to fuse during the shoot for the apple pie, the one from her grandfather’s letter. As Liina peeled the apples, the scent filling the warm kitchen, she told Rasmus the story in her quiet, understated way, even showing him the letter itself. Rasmus held the fragile paper, his professional briskness melting away completely. He didn't say anything for a long time. When he finally started shooting, his approach was different. He was no longer just documenting a process. He shot Liina’s hands as she crimped the pastry, not as disembodied tools, but as hands that were continuing a long tradition of love and care. He focused on the steam fogging up the windowpane, a visual metaphor for the blurring of past and present. The final shot was not of a perfect slice on a plate. Instead, he had Liina stand in the open doorway of the cottage, just as her grandmother had done, holding the freshly baked pie. The late afternoon sun lit her from behind, creating a halo effect, and the wind coming off the sea lifted a few strands of her hair. The shot was technically imperfect—there was lens flare, the background was a blur of wild garden—but it was emotionally resonant. It captured not just a pie, but a longing, a message, a vigil. “Baltic Soul,” Rasmus said quietly, looking at the image on his camera’s small screen, his voice full of discovery.

Toomas became an unexpected and essential part of the project. He appeared on the second day, drawn by the unusual activity, and stood at the edge of the property, watching with a curious, slightly suspicious air. Liina invited him in, and Rasmus, fascinated by the old man’s deeply lined face and expressive, work-worn hands, asked if he could take his picture. Toomas grumbled but acquiesced, and soon found himself a willing model. Rasmus took a stunning portrait of him sitting at the kitchen table, holding a steaming mug of coffee, the light from the window carving deep ravines and highlights into his face. The photograph told a story of a lifetime of hard work, resilience, and quiet dignity. He became their resident consultant, providing historical context, identifying wild herbs, and, much to Rasmus’s delight, critiquing Liina’s baking with the blunt honesty of an old friend. “Good crumb on that bread, girl,” he’d declare after a taste test. “But Elvi’s was a shade darker. She let the crust get almost burnt. Said that’s where the flavour lived.” This detail was gold, and Rasmus would immediately adjust his lighting to emphasize the dark, rustic crust in the photos.

As the days passed, a comfortable, creative rhythm was established. Anni, the quiet assistant, revealed a talent for seeing the small, beautiful details Rasmus sometimes missed—a drop of condensation on a jar of pickles, the pattern of flour dust on the floorboards—and she would silently point them out. Liina moved with a new, understated authority, not just baking but art-directing, guiding Rasmus toward the heart of each recipe’s story. “For this one, can we see the chip on the bowl?” she’d ask. “That chip happened when my mother was a little girl and dropped it. It’s part of its history.” Rasmus, in turn, taught her to see her own world through a new lens, showing her how the ordinary could be rendered extraordinary through framing and light. He was no longer a city artist imposing a vision, but a translator, helping her find the visual vocabulary for the feelings and memories she had struggled to articulate. They were a team, building the book together, page by page, image by image, in the warm, fragrant sanctuary of the little kitchen.The final week of the shoot settled into a deeply productive and almost familial routine. The cottage, which had at first seemed overwhelmed by the intrusion of modern technology, had absorbed it, domesticating the tripods and light reflectors until they seemed as much a part of the furniture as the worn armchair. The team moved around each other with the easy, unspoken choreography of people who had spent countless hours in close quarters, united by a single purpose. Anni, no longer a quiet shadow, now anticipated Liina’s needs, fetching a specific bowl or a dusting of flour before she even asked. Rasmus had abandoned his city impatience entirely, learning to read the subtle shifts of the island’s light like a native. He’d spend hours waiting for a specific sunbeam to strike the jar of pickled chanterelles on the windowsill, convinced it was the only light that could properly capture their earthy, golden glow. They worked their way through the heart of the winter chapter, photographing hearty lentil soups that steamed invitingly in earthenware bowls and dense, dark loaves of bread that looked as solid and comforting as the island’s bedrock.

The grand finale of the shoot, a moment they all felt building with a kind of hushed reverence, was the staging of the *Jõulukook*. Liina retrieved the cake from its tin in the pantry, the rum-soaked cloth having kept it perfectly moist and imbued it with an aroma so profound it seemed to silence the room. It was the physical embodiment of the book’s central theme: a dark, dense, un-showy object that held within it an immense history of patience, faith, and celebration. Rasmus circled it like a wary naturalist observing a rare and mythical creature. He knew this single cake was the symbolic climax of their entire endeavor, the heart of the winter section, and he was determined to do it justice. He vetoed all his own professional instincts for bright, revealing light, instead announcing they would wait for the sun to set completely.

As dusk settled, painting the sky outside in shades of deep violet and indigo, the kitchen transformed. Rasmus forbade the use of any electric lights, and Anni, taking his cue, lit a collection of mismatched candles and old oil lamps, placing them around the room. The flickering, golden light threw dancing shadows on the walls and glinted off the dark surface of the cake, creating an atmosphere that felt less like a photoshoot and more like a seventeenth-century Dutch master’s painting. Toomas, who had arrived for his customary evening coffee, sat silently in the armchair, a willing part of the tableau. In this timeless, intimate light, Liina took the silver-handled knife and cut the first slice. The blade sank through the dense, moist crumb with a satisfying weight. Rasmus, his camera on a tripod to accommodate the long exposure, worked in near silence, his shutter clicking softly in the quiet room. He didn’t photograph the slice on a plate, but rather the act of it being offered from Liina’s hand to Toomas’s, a transfer of tradition and sustenance, the flickering candlelight catching the jewels of fruit in the dark cake.

After the final shot was captured, the spell was broken not by a director’s call, but by Liina placing a slice of the cake on a plate for everyone. They gathered around the kitchen table—Liina, the artist; Rasmus, the translator; Anni, the quiet observer; and Toomas, the guardian of memory—and they ate. The flavour of the cake was extraordinary, a complex symphony of spice, fruit, and time. Each bite was a journey through the seasons: the preserved sweetness of summer berries, the earthy depth of autumn nuts, and the defiant warmth of winter spices. It tasted of history, of storms weathered and of quiet faith in the eventual return of the light. In the flickering candlelight, surrounded by the ghosts of generations past, they ate their creation, and the simple act felt like the most profound and fitting celebration of the work they had accomplished together.

The final day was heavy with the bittersweet air of departure. The comfortable, creative chaos was dismantled piece by piece as Anni carefully packed away the lenses, lights, and cables, returning the cottage to its original state. The space felt suddenly larger, emptier. For their very last shot, Rasmus chose something simple. He placed Vanaema Elvi’s leather-bound journal on the table, open to a page with her spidery script. He had Liina place her own hands, lightly dusted with flour, on either side of the book, not writing, not reading, but simply resting, as if in a state of quiet communion. The image was a perfect, wordless summary of the entire project: a story of inheritance, interpretation, and the tangible connection between generations. When Rasmus finally said, “That’s a wrap,” the words hung in the air, both a release and an ending.

The goodbyes at the door were awkward and heartfelt. Anni, her shyness briefly forgotten, gave Liina a quick, firm hug. “Thank you,” she whispered. “This was… the best job I’ve ever had.” Toomas, his face etched with a gruff affection, took Liina’s hand in both of his. “Elvi would be proud of you, girl,” he said, his voice thick. “You listened to the house. You listened to her.” The last and longest farewell was with Rasmus. He stood by the open door of the van, the city artist about to be reabsorbed by his world. “I came here to shoot a cookbook,” he said, shaking his head slightly as if in disbelief. “I think… I think I ended up being part of one instead. Thank you, Liina. For trusting me. For reminding me that the most beautiful things are rarely the most perfect.” He gave her a brief, brotherly hug, and then they were gone, the white van disappearing down the gravel track, leaving only silence and a faint scent of diesel in its wake.

Liina stood in the doorway, watching until the van was out of sight. The silence that rushed in to fill the void was immense, but it was not the lonely silence she had first encountered months ago. This silence was layered, resonant with the echoes of shared laughter, intense creative debates, and the quiet satisfaction of work well done. She walked back into the kitchen. It was tidy, clean, almost exactly as she had found it, yet it felt entirely different. It was no longer just her grandmother’s kitchen; it was her studio, her collaborator, a silent character in the story she was now ready to tell. She didn’t feel a sense of loss, but a sense of completion. The project had taken on its own life within these walls, and now it was time for it to go out into the world.

A week later, an email from Rasmus arrived. The subject line was simply: *‘Baltic Soul.’* Inside was a link to a password-protected gallery. Her heart pounding with a mixture of excitement and terror, Liina clicked. The images loaded one by one, and she felt the breath catch in her throat. It was all there. Rasmus had captured it all, with a sensitivity and depth that went beyond mere photography. He had caught the motes of flour dancing in a sunbeam, the chipped rim of the earthenware bowl, the deep love and respect in Toomas’s eyes as he accepted a slice of cake. He had photographed the joy, the patience, the history, the longing. He hadn't just taken pictures of her food; he had captured the soul of her kitchen. Scrolling through the gallery, Liina saw her book, her real book, for the very first time, not as a stack of pages and a collection of recipes, but as a complete, living, breathing world. It was a world that was messy, and honest, and true. And it was more beautiful than she could have ever dared to imagine.The winter that followed was a quiet, fallow time. With the manuscript and photographs delivered, Liina’s role in the book’s creation became more remote, a series of emails and phone calls that felt like echoes from a distant world. She remained on Hiiumaa, sinking into the deep, restorative peace of the island’s darkest months. She tended the stove, read stacks of novels borrowed from the tiny mobile library, and took long, bracing walks along the frozen shoreline, where the sea breathed clouds of icy mist into the frigid air. The frantic energy of the past year receded, and in its place settled a profound sense of quiet anticipation. She was waiting, just as her grandmother had waited for letters, for ships, for the dough to rise. She was waiting for her story to come back to her, transformed into a book.

The call to return to Tallinn came with the first thaws of late February, when the days were beginning to lengthen and the iron-grey sky occasionally fractured to reveal a sliver of brilliant, hopeful blue. Eva needed her for the final design and layout phase. This time, arriving in the city felt different. The noise and rush were still jarring, but she no longer felt like a foreigner in her own life. She walked through the familiar streets of the Old Town not as a nervous student scurrying to the library, but as a woman returning to one of her homes, carrying the quiet confidence of her other, wilder home within her. The city was a place she visited, a tool she used; the cottage was where she lived.

The Varrak offices, once so intimidating, now felt like a collaborator’s workshop. In a bright studio, she met with Eva and a young, gentle-faced book designer named Priit. Spread across a vast table were proofs of her book’s pages, a mosaic of her words and Rasmus’s photographs. Seeing them laid out together for the first time was breathtaking. Priit, with an intuitive understanding of the project’s soul, had avoided all slick, corporate design. The font he had chosen was an elegant serif that echoed the grace of her vanaema’s script without directly mimicking it. He had left generous white space around the text, allowing the words to breathe. Rasmus’s photos were given full pages, their rich, dark tones and emotional depth anchoring the entire design. It was more beautiful, more real, than she could have imagined.

Her art history background, which had felt so disconnected from her baking, suddenly found its purpose. She looked at the layouts not just as a writer, but as a curator, her eye instinctively attuned to balance, rhythm, and visual narrative. "Here," she said, pointing to a spread where a recipe for fish soup was placed opposite a full-page photo of the stormy sea. "Could we move this photo? It's beautiful, but it's a photograph of loneliness. The soup is about comfort, about coming home. It should be opposite the photo of Toomas's hands holding the mug, or the one of the warm kitchen." Priit and Eva looked at each other, then back at the layout, and nodded in unison. Liina’s suggestion was not just an aesthetic choice; it was a narrative one. She worked with them for three days, her input invaluable, ensuring that the book’s physical form was as honest as its content. They chose a thick, creamy paper stock that felt substantial and warm to the touch. For the cover, they unanimously selected the photo Rasmus had taken in the doorway: Liina, her form haloed by the setting sun, holding the apple pie like an offering. The title, *Baltic Soul: Recipes and Stories from a Hiiumaa Kitchen*, was placed simply at the top, and below, in smaller type, her name: Liina Vesk.

Holding the final proof of the cover in her hands was a strange, out-of-body experience. That silhouetted figure was her, yet it was also a character in a story, a stand-in for her grandmother, for all women who have ever used food to say ‘I love you, come home safe.’ The circle was complete. The art history student who analyzed the iconography of Netherlandish altarpieces was now creating her own, her subject not saints and martyrs, but bakers and fishermen, her medium not oil paint and wood panel, but ink, paper, and memory. She had finally managed to synthesize the two halves of herself, the academic and the artisan, into a single, cohesive whole.

Months passed. Spring arrived in a riot of green, and the cottage garden exploded with life. Summer followed, hot and languid. Liina baked, she wrote in her journal, she tended her plants, and she waited. The book was an abstract concept, a distant promise. Then one afternoon in early September, a year after she had first arrived at the cottage with her grief and her vanaema’s journal, a delivery van rumbled down her lane. The driver handed her a heavy, rectangular cardboard box from her publisher. Her hands trembled as she carried it inside and set it on the kitchen table, in the exact spot where she had written the first words. She slit the tape with a kitchen knife, her heart hammering a frantic rhythm against her ribs. Inside, nestled in protective paper, were ten copies of her book.

She lifted one out. The cover was matte, the image of the pie in the doorway radiating a quiet, golden warmth. The title was embossed, a subtle, pleasing texture under her fingertips. It smelled of ink and binding glue and possibility. It was real. She opened it, her hands clumsy, and the pages fell open to a random spread: a photo of the wild strawberry patch on one side, and on the other, her recipe for the jam, prefaced with the story of her grandfather complaining about the bland food on his ship. She ran her fingers over her own name on the cover, then flipped to the dedication page. The words stood stark and simple on the creamy paper: *For Vanaema Elvi, who taught me the language of the kitchen.* A wave of emotion, a complex blend of grief, gratitude, and overwhelming joy, washed over her, and she sank into a chair, clutching the book to her chest, tears finally blurring the familiar, beloved scene of her own kitchen.

Later that afternoon, she took a copy and walked the familiar path over the ridge to Toomas’s cottage. He was in his front garden, meticulously weeding a patch of late-season carrots. She held the book out to him without a word. He wiped his earthy hands on his trousers before taking it, handling it with a reverence that touched her deeply. He stared at the cover for a long time, then opened it, his thick finger tracing the lines of text. He stopped at the full-page portrait Rasmus had taken of him, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. He continued to leaf through, pausing at pictures of the house, of the shoreline, of familiar tools and pots. Finally, he closed the book and looked at her, his old eyes glistening with unshed tears. "You did it, girl," he said, his voice husky. "You brought her back. Her hands, her kitchen… it’s all here. You took the seeds, and you made a forest."The launch party for *Baltic Soul* was held in a sleek, minimalist bookstore in Tallinn’s hippest district, a place of polished concrete, soaring white walls, and carefully curated stacks of high-minded literature. It was a world of sharp angles and intellectual cool, and Liina, standing at its centre, felt like a wildflower that had been potted and brought indoors for display. She wore a simple, dark blue dress, the nicest thing she owned, but she felt more at home in her flour-dusted apron. Guests milled around, sipping prosecco from slender flutes and nibbling on canapés that were tiny, abstract constructions of foam and gelée—the very kind of food her book was a rebellion against. The irony was not lost on her. Her book, a tribute to rustic imperfection and the messy reality of a working kitchen, was being celebrated in a space where one felt hesitant to even leave a crumb.

Kaisa, magnificent in a sharp blazer and acting as a self-appointed bodyguard, stayed close to her side. “Look at them all,” she whispered conspiratorially, nodding towards a group of well-known food bloggers. “They’re talking about the ‘phenomenology of your flavour narrative.’ I think that means they like the jam.” Liina gave a nervous laugh, her hand instinctively going to the small, worn leather-bound journal she had, for courage, slipped into her handbag. The publisher had arranged a large poster of the book’s cover, and seeing her own silhouetted form, holding the pie like a beacon, blown up to life-size was a deeply surreal experience. People kept approaching her, their faces glowing with praise, telling her how brave, how authentic, how important her book was. She smiled and thanked them, her responses feeling small and inadequate in the face of their effusive praise. The book had been on the shelves for a month and had, to everyone’s astonishment, become a runaway bestseller, praised by critics not just as a cookbook, but as a significant work of memoir and cultural preservation.

Hendrik Palm, the producer from *Vabariigi Maiasmokk*, appeared through the crowd, his smile wide and genuine. “Liina! A triumph! An absolute triumph! I always knew that honey cake was just the beginning. We’ve had a dozen contestants try to replicate your success with ‘narrative baking’ this season. It’s all very… earnest.” He patted her arm, the consummate showman pleased that his production line had turned out such a quality product. Chef Alani was there too, her warmth a welcome anchor in the overwhelming room. She hugged Liina fiercely. “I read it in one sitting,” she said, her eyes shining. “I felt like I was sitting in your vanaema’s kitchen. You didn’t just write a cookbook, my dear. You wrote an heirloom.” The word, ‘heirloom’, struck a deep chord in Liina, and she felt a blush of genuine pleasure.

The person she was most anxious to see, however, was the one she saw last. Rein Tamm, the formidable food critic, entered the party late and alone. He did not mingle. He moved directly through the crowd, which parted for him as if by instinct, and acquired a glass of still water from the bar. Dressed in his usual severe grey suit, he looked like a hawk that had mistakenly flown into a cage of brightly-coloured parakeets. Liina watched him as he picked up a copy of her book from a display table. He didn’t flip through it. He stood and read. He read the introduction, then the story of the letters, standing amidst the swirl of the party, completely absorbed. Liina’s heart pounded. After what felt like an eternity, he closed the book, placed it carefully back on the table, and made his way towards her.

Kaisa tensed beside her. The buzz around them seemed to quieten as the critic approached. Rein Tamm stopped in front of Liina, his gaze as direct and unsparing as it had been on the day of the final. He held up his glass of water in a gesture that was not quite a toast. “Miss Vesk,” he began, his voice the same flat, precise instrument she remembered. “I came here this evening for one reason. To tell you that your book has made my job significantly more difficult.” Liina blinked, confused. “How so?” she managed to ask. “Because,” he continued, a flicker of something that might have been dry wit in his eyes, “after reading your account of what food can and should mean, I find ninety percent of the dishes I am served in this city to be utterly, unforgivably pointless.” He took a slow sip of his water. “You have reminded this country that a recipe is not a set of instructions, but a testament. That food is not a performance, but a form of communion. You did not just write down your grandmother’s recipes. You successfully transcribed her love. That is a rare and difficult thing.” He gave a single, formal nod. “Thank you for your work.” And with that, he turned and walked away, leaving a stunned silence in his wake.

Later that night, long after the party had wound down, Liina and Kaisa sat on the floor of the old Toompea flat. The champagne bottles and canapé trays of the launch were forgotten. Instead, on the scarred pine table between them, was a pot of tea and a simple, lopsided apple crumble Liina had baked that afternoon, a nervous habit returning. The tiny flat was quiet again, the distant sounds of the city a muffled lullaby. “He said your book made his job harder!” Kaisa crowed for the tenth time, kicking her heels against the floor in delight. “You broke the food critic! With a book about jam! This is the greatest victory in the history of literature!” Liina laughed, a deep, genuine laugh of pure relief and happiness. She looked around the small room where her journey had begun in a state of anxious, vibrating silence. It felt like a lifetime ago. The anxiety was gone, replaced by a quiet, solid sense of self that felt as rooted and resilient as the old apple trees in the Hiiumaa garden.

A week later, she was back at the cottage. The frantic energy of Tallinn melted away the moment she stepped off the ferry. The silence of the island welcomed her like an old friend. The house was just as she’d left it, cool, quiet, and smelling of woodsmoke and dried herbs. A thick pile of mail sat on the floor by the door. She sifted through it as she made a pot of tea: bills, flyers, a few magazines with glowing reviews of her book, and a handful of fan letters sent via her publisher. She read them with a smile, touched by the kind words. But it was the last letter in the pile that made her sit down at the kitchen table. The envelope was thin, almost translucent, the address written in a shaky, elderly hand. The postmark was from Toronto, Canada.

She opened it carefully. The letter inside was written on delicate, lined paper, the script faint but clear. *‘Dear Miss Vesk,’* it began. *‘I am an old woman, ninety-two years of age. I have lived in Canada since I was a girl, but I was born on Saaremaa, the island next to yours. A friend sent me your book, and I have been reading it every day since it arrived. My hands are too stiff to cook now, but your words have allowed me to taste my mother’s food again. I cried when I read your chapter on the Jõulukook. My own mother had a nearly identical recipe, a secret she guarded fiercely. We lost her handwritten book during the war, when we had to leave with nothing but the clothes on our backs. For seventy-five years, I have tried to remember the exact combination of spices, but the memory was like a ghost, always just out of reach. Your recipe… it is her recipe. Reading it was like hearing her voice in my ear after a lifetime of silence. You have given me back a piece of my own lost soul. How can I ever thank you for such a gift?’*

Liina read the letter twice, her vision blurring with tears. She looked up from the fragile page, her gaze falling on her own book, lying on the table. The bestseller lists, the glowing reviews from famous critics, the glamour of the launch party—it all faded into insignificance. This single, heartfelt letter from a stranger across the ocean was the true measure of her success. This was the communion Rein Tamm had spoken of. She had not just transcribed her own grandmother’s love; she had given voice to the love of a thousand forgotten grandmothers, sending their messages out across the sea, across the decades, to the children and grandchildren who were still listening for them. She had taken the seeds Toomas had spoken of, and they had not just made a forest; they had crossed an ocean. In the profound quiet of the Hiiumaa kitchen, surrounded by the gentle ghosts of the past, Liina Vesk, the Republic’s Sweet-tooth, finally understood the full, nourishing, and boundless power of what she had created.The letter lay on the table, a fragile testament from a world away. Liina sat before it for a long time, the familiar sounds of the cottage—the contented ticking of the clock, the low sigh of the wind in the chimney—seeming to hold their breath around it. The book’s public success had been a distant, abstract noise, a wave crashing on a faraway shore. This letter was a quiet knock on her own door. It was proof that the message in the bottle she had sent out had not just been found, but had quenched a thirst she hadn’t even known existed. This was not about celebrity or sales figures; this was about repatriation, a single, lost memory carefully carried home across an ocean of time. She finally rose and went to the small wooden desk in the corner. She took out a sheet of thick, creamy paper, the same kind she had chosen for the book, and her best fountain pen. Her reply could not be a quick email; it had to be an object, a continuation of the physical correspondence that had inspired her work.

She wrote slowly, choosing her words with the same care she would use to measure spices. She thanked the woman for her letter, for sharing her own story. She told her about Toomas, about the community’s collective memory of her vanaema, reinforcing the idea that she was not alone in her nostalgia. She tried to describe the Hiiumaa winter, the profound silence and the brilliant stars on a clear, cold night. Then she paused, wanting to send more than just words. She went outside into the crisp, clean air and walked to the sheltered side of the house where, even in the cold, a hardy sprig of thyme grew between the foundation stones. She carefully snipped a small piece. Its sharp, herbaceous scent was a tiny, defiant promise of the coming spring. Back inside, she tucked the sprig of thyme into the fold of the letter. It was a fragment of the island, a piece of the flavour she had only been able to describe. It was a secret, passed from one kitchen to another. As she sealed the envelope, she felt a profound sense of purpose settle over her, a feeling far quieter but more enduring than the fleeting triumph of the competition.

The deep winter held the island in its crystalline grip, but Liina no longer felt its isolation. The mail, once an irrelevance, became a quiet, steady rhythm in her life. Letters began to arrive weekly, forwarded from her publisher. They came from all over the world: a man in Australia who remembered his father’s love for black rye bread; a young woman in Michigan, a third-generation Estonian, who was now baking her way through the book to feel closer to ancestors she had never met; a retired schoolteacher from Tartu who simply wanted to say that the chapter on apple preserves had reminded her of her own childhood. Each letter was a small, glowing ember, and together they created a constellation of shared memory around her. She was not just an author; she had become a confessor, a curator of other people’s nostalgia. She answered every letter by hand, her small desk becoming a way station for stories travelling back and forth across the globe.

Spring arrived, as it always did on Hiiumaa, not as a single event but as a slow, hesitant awakening. The first snowdrops appeared in the churchyard, their brave white heads pushing through the last patches of snow. The sea ice began to break up with a sound like distant thunder, and the days grew longer, the light softer. With the change in season came a visit from Kaisa, who arrived on a Saturday ferry looking pale and exhausted from the final push of her law school semester. “I need de-citifying,” she announced, dropping her bags on the floor and inhaling deeply. “My soul is clogged with legal precedents and terrible coffee. Please tell me you have something with butter in it.” Liina, laughing, led her to the table where a freshly baked rhubarb and ginger cake sat waiting.

As they ate, Kaisa updated her on the life she had left behind. “You’re a phenomenon, you know,” she said, waving her fork. “There are think-pieces about you. ‘The Vesk Method: Culinary Authenticity in a Post-Modern World.’ It’s ridiculous. Oh, and Hendrik Palm’s office called me, trying to get to you. They want to offer you a new TV series. A travelogue. ‘Liina Vesk’s Search for Estonia’s Lost Recipes.’ They’re offering an insane amount of money.” Liina listened, a small smile playing on her lips. A year ago, that offer would have been a dream come true, a path to a gleaming studio kitchen and a whirlwind of fame. Now, it sounded like a distraction, a noisy interruption. “I’m not searching for lost recipes anymore,” she said quietly. “I’m right where they live.” Kaisa looked at her, at the calm confidence in her eyes, and nodded slowly. “I thought you’d say that. Good. That show would have terrible lighting anyway.”

The idea came, as most good ideas do, not in a flash of inspiration, but in a moment of simple, shared activity. The next day, Liina was showing Kaisa how to plait the dough for a Kringel, the sweet, cardamom-scented bread from the first chapter of her book. Kaisa’s hands, so adept at highlighting legal texts, were clumsy with the soft dough, her braid uneven and lumpy. But she was laughing, utterly absorbed in the task. “I’m terrible at this,” she declared happily, “but I love it. It feels… useful. It’s like all the anxiety is going out of my fingers and into the dough.” Liina watched her friend’s focused, joyful expression. She thought of the letters, of all the people yearning for a connection to this process. The book was a bridge, but it was still a one-way communication. What if she could open the door? “You should teach this, Liina,” Kaisa said, as if reading her mind. “Not on TV. Here. In this kitchen. A week of this would fix any lawyer in Tallinn.”

The seed, once planted, took root immediately. The concept unfurled in her mind, complete and fully formed. Not a cooking school. A workshop. An immersion. A small group of people, living in and around the cottage for a week, participating in the full rhythm of the place. They wouldn’t just follow recipes; they would forage in the woods, they would harvest from the garden, they would learn to listen to the stove, they would sit around the table and share stories. She would not be a celebrity chef demonstrating techniques; she would be a guide, sharing a way of life. The next week, she placed a small, simple notice on a few online forums for Estonians living abroad and on the final page of her publisher’s newsletter. *‘Baltic Soul: A Kitchen Workshop. A one-week immersion in the food and stories of Hiiumaa. Learn the rhythm of a traditional island kitchen, from foraging to feasting. Limited to six participants.’* She listed her email address and, with a nervous flutter, sent the notice out into the world.

The response was immediate and overwhelming. Within a week, she had received over two hundred inquiries. She read through them, her heart aching at the palpable longing in the messages. She chose her first six participants not based on skill, but on the stories they told. There was a young software engineer from San Francisco whose grandparents had been from Hiiumaa and who wanted to learn the skills they had lost. There was a retired teacher from Melbourne who collected cookbooks and had dreamed of visiting Estonia her entire life. There was a young couple from Helsinki who wanted to learn about a simpler, more sustainable way of living. She booked out the local tourist farm down the lane to house them and spent a month in a flurry of happy, anxious preparation.

The day the first group arrived, Liina felt the same nervous energy she had felt before the *Vabariigi Maiasmokk* final. They gathered awkwardly in her kitchen, a collection of strangers brought together by her words. They were shy at first, hesitant, unsure of what to expect. Liina didn’t start with an introduction or a lecture. She simply handed each of them a small wicker basket. “Welcome,” she said, her voice calm and sure in the familiar space. “The chanterelles are out in the north woods. We don’t want to be late.” As she led them down the familiar path into the cool, moss-scented silence of the forest, she saw their city shoulders begin to relax, their gazes lifting from their feet to the canopy above. Later that day, the kitchen was no longer quiet. It was filled with the low murmur of conversation, the rhythmic chop of vegetables, the clatter of pots, and bursts of laughter. The six strangers, their hands dusted with flour, were gathered around the scarred pine table, working together to prepare a meal from the mushrooms they had foraged themselves. Liina stood back, leaning against the warm side of the iron stove, and watched. The room was aglow with the golden light of the afternoon sun, alive with purposeful activity and burgeoning friendship. It was no longer just her grandmother’s kitchen, or even her own. It had become what it was always meant to be: a heart, beating strong and warm, its doors wide open, feeding not just bodies, but souls. Her soul.### 10.

The kitchen was a symphony of unfamiliar rhythms. Where there had once been only Liina’s solitary, focused movements, there was now the hesitant scrape of a knife wielded by an unpracticed hand, the splash of spilled milk followed by a soft apology, the low murmur of questions, and the bright, surprising sound of six different kinds of laughter. Liina moved through the controlled chaos not as a conductor, but as a gentle current, nudging a hand here, offering a quiet word there, her presence a calming influence on the bustling space. She watched as Matias, the software engineer from San Francisco, stared at the sourdough starter with the intense frown of a man trying to debug a complex algorithm. He held a digital thermometer, perplexed by Liina’s instruction to feed the starter “when it smells a little like green apples and looks tired.” It was a language his world of binary logic had not prepared him for. Across the table, Eleanor, the retired teacher from Melbourne with eyes that shone with a lifetime of curiosity, was painstakingly sketching the veining on a cabbage leaf in a small notebook, her recipe notes already interspersed with the names of birds she had spotted that morning.

“It’s not code, Matias,” Liina said softly, coming to stand beside him. He looked up, his frustration evident. “But it should be consistent. Predictable inputs should yield predictable outputs. This thing… it’s moody.” Liina smiled. “My vanaema used to say the starter had its own moods. She said it got sluggish when a storm was coming and cheerful on a sunny morning. She didn’t see it as a problem to be fixed. She saw it as a conversation.” She dipped a finger into the starter. “Forget the thermometer. Just smell it. Listen to it. Does it feel lively or lazy today?” Matias leaned in, his expression skeptical, and inhaled. For a moment, he was silent, and then a look of dawning comprehension crossed his face. “Green apples,” he murmured, a note of wonder in his voice. “It really does smell like green apples.”

The week unfolded in a rhythm dictated by the island itself. Their classroom was not just the kitchen, but the entire landscape. One morning, they followed Toomas down to the shore, his stride steady and sure-footed over the slippery rocks. He showed them how to read the patterns of the waves and the flight of the gulls to know where the fish were running. They helped him pull in his nets, their hands, soft from city life, struggling with the rough, wet rope. The flounder they caught, glistening and silver in the pale morning light, became their lunch, fried in butter within an hour of leaving the sea. For the participants, it was a revelation. Food was not something that appeared, cellophane-wrapped, under the fluorescent lights of a supermarket; it was a negotiation with the elements, a reward for patience and knowledge, a direct link in a chain of life that stretched from the cold Baltic Sea to the warm plate in front of them. Eleanor declared it the most profound meal she had ever eaten.

The breakthrough for Matias came on the fourth day, during the rye bread bake. He had, under Liina’s gentle encouragement, put away his digital scale and thermometer. He approached the huge wooden dough trough with a nervousness he usually reserved for a major server migration. Liina didn’t give him measurements. She had him add the flour by feel, the water by sight, teaching him to look for the exact moment the shaggy mass began to cohere into a living, breathing dough. His first attempt was too sticky, his second too dry. But on the third, something clicked. His movements, at first jerky and uncertain, became more fluid, more confident. He leaned over the trough, his body swaying in a steady rhythm, his hands learning a new, ancient language. When he finally shaped the loaf and carved his initial into its top—a tentative, uneven ‘M’—his face was flushed with a kind of primal, creative joy Liina recognized instantly. The loaf that emerged from the oven hours later was not perfectly shaped, its crust a little too dark on one side, but to Matias, it was a masterpiece. He held it to his chest, inhaling its earthy, tangy scent, and his smile was brighter than any screen.

On their final evening, they held a feast. The kitchen buzzed with a collaborative, joyful energy that was the antithesis of the high-pressure, competitive kitchens Liina had known. There was no single showstopper, but a table groaning under the weight of their collective efforts. There was Matias’s slightly lopsided but deeply flavourful rye bread, a rich fish soup made from the last of Toomas’s catch, a vibrant salad of greens and herbs from the garden, roasted root vegetables still sweet with the island’s soil, and for dessert, a simple, glorious berry tart that Eleanor had decorated with edible flowers. They invited Toomas, who sat at the head of the table like a benevolent patriarch, telling stories of the island’s past as they ate. The room was loud with chatter and laughter, the candlelight dancing on the happy, flushed faces of the six strangers who had, over the course of a week, become a kind of temporary family.

The next morning, after the last taxi had rumbled away down the lane, a profound quiet descended upon the cottage. Liina stood in the centre of her kitchen, now clean and tidy, everything back in its place. The silence that had once felt like a thick, treacly thing, was now different. It was a restful, resonant silence, full of the echoes of the week’s joy. It was not an emptiness, but a space waiting to be filled again. On the pine table, one of the participants had left something behind: a small, perfect seashell placed next to a copy of her book. Liina picked it up, its spiralled form cool and smooth in her palm. It was a small, simple gift, a token of gratitude. The workshops, she realized, were the final, missing ingredient in her own recipe for happiness. It was not enough to receive the legacy, or even to preserve it. The true purpose of the warmth she had cultivated was to share it, to open the door and let the world in, then to enjoy the peaceful, echoing quiet after it had gone. This cycle of gathering, sharing, and peaceful solitude was the true rhythm of the house, the true rhythm of her heart. She placed the seashell on the windowsill, where it caught the morning light, a small, shining promise of all the stories yet to come.
