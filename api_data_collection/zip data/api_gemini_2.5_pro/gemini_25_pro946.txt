The air was thick enough to drink. A hot, wet towel of a Tuesday morning, the kind that made the bitumen on the roads soft and the tourists walking the Esplanade look like they were melting in slow motion. For Cass Daley, it was just air. The stuff you breathed between the downstroke and the upstroke, the fuel you burned along with last night's two-minute noodles. Her lungs were furnaces, her thighs were pistons, and the bike, a battered but beloved vintage steel-frame she’d named ‘The Rusty Pelican’, was an extension of her own skeleton. She carved through the sluggish Cairns traffic, a blur of spinning spokes and wiry muscle, the salt from her own sweat stinging her eyes. Tourists in hire cars, unaccustomed to the laissez-faire attitude of local road rules, honked and swerved. Cass just grinned, the wind a weak balm on her sun-scorched face. This was her element. Not the singing. The singing was a ghost, a strange melody that lived in her throat and decided to come out on its own terms. The bike, though—the bike was real. It was iron and rubber and grease and effort. It was honest.

Her destination was the city library, a concrete behemoth that promised two things she craved: air-conditioning so cold it could raise goosebumps on a snowman, and free Wi-Fi. She chained The Pelican to a skeletal bike rack, giving the top tube a fond pat, and sprinted up the steps, her cleats clicking a frantic rhythm on the tiles. Inside, the chill was a physical blow. She sighed, a long, rattling sound of pure relief, and slumped into a vacant orange plastic chair in the computer bank. The login screen swam before her eyes. Her fingers, trembling slightly from the exertion and the sudden temperature drop, fumbled on the keyboard. There was only one reason she was here. One email she was waiting for. The subject line was either going to be a polite, corporate ‘Thank you for your submission’ or it was going to be ‘Voice of the Nation – Grand Finalist Information’. Anything else was just noise.

Her inbox loaded with agonising slowness, the little blue circle spinning, spinning, spinning like a wheel stuck in the mud. She could feel her own pulse in her temples, a frantic drum against the library’s enforced silence. Junk. Bill reminder. A newsletter from a cycling gear company. And then. There. The words seemed to leap off the screen, glowing with an impossible, holy light. ‘Voice of the Nation – You’re In!’

Cass didn’t scream. She didn’t leap up and down. A weird, high-pitched noise escaped her, a sort of choked whimper, like a puppy being stood on. An elderly man doing a crossword two terminals down glared at her over his spectacles. She clamped a hand over her mouth, her whole body vibrating with a joy so fierce it felt like it was going to tear her apart. She clicked the email. The formal text swam, a blur of congratulations and corporate jargon. ‘…impressed the judges…unique vocal timbre…a raw talent…’ She scrolled down, past the fluff, looking for the meat. The details. The where, the when. Grand Final. The Sydney Opera House. Stage. Lights. A live orchestra. The date was three weeks away. Three weeks. A lifetime and no time at all. She felt a laugh, a real, bubbling, unrestrained laugh, build in her chest and she had to physically bite her lip to keep it from exploding out of her and getting her ejected by the stern-faced librarian.

Sydney. She’d never been. The name itself sounded like a myth, a glittering metropolis from a movie, a million miles away from the damp, clinging heat of Far North Queensland. A fresh wave of dizziness washed over her. *This is it. This is actually it.* The competition had been a whim, a dare she’d made with herself. She’d seen a poster flapping on a telegraph pole, recorded a video on her cheap phone in her echoey bathroom, singing a broken-down, acoustic version of a pop song she barely knew the words to, and sent it in, expecting nothing. Then came the email for the state finals in Brisbane. She’d scraped together the bus fare, slept on the floor of a stranger from a fan forum, and sung her heart out to a panel of three bored-looking industry types. She’d been sure she’d blown it. Her voice had cracked. She’d forgotten a line. But they’d seen something. Raw, they’d called it. Unpolished. Honest. Like her bike.

She read the email again, and then a third time, just to be sure it wasn’t a particularly cruel spam filter hallucination. It was real. She was going to Sydney. She was going to sing on a stage bigger than her entire apartment block. She pushed back from the computer, a massive, idiot grin plastered across her face. She felt light, untethered. She wanted to run, to cycle a hundred kilometres, to swim out to Green Island. Instead, she walked, legs wobbly, out of the library and back into the oppressive heat. The humidity didn't feel oppressive now; it felt like a warm embrace. The tourist traffic wasn’t an annoyance; it was a festival parade in her honour. She unchained The Pelican, and for a moment, just stood there, her hand on the worn handlebar grip. The singing was a ghost, but it was a ghost that had just bought her a ticket to the ball.

The grin stayed on her face for the entire ride to Rusty’s Bike Shed, a dingy, magical kingdom of grease and steel tucked down a graffiti-lined alleyway. It was the only place that felt like home. Len, the proprietor, a man who looked as though he’d been assembled from spare bike parts and weathered leather, was truing a wheel, his face a mask of concentration. He didn’t look up as she burst in.
“Don’t tell me,” he grunted, plucking a spoke with a greasy fingernail. It made a dull *thunk*. “You’ve cracked the bottom bracket again.”
“Better,” Cass gasped, leaning over the counter, trying to catch her breath. “Much, much better.”
He finally looked at her, his pale blue eyes squinting. “You’ve got that look. The one you get when you’ve beaten your personal best up the Gillies Range. What is it?”
“I’m in.” The words were barely a whisper.
“In? In what? Trouble?”
“The final. The singing thing. The big one. In Sydney.”
Len put the wheel down. He slowly, deliberately, wiped his hands on an already-filthy rag, his eyes never leaving her face. He saw the shimmering, unadulterated hope in them. He’d seen it before, but it had been a long time. A slow smile spread across his own creased face.
“Well, I’ll be.” He shook his head, a genuine chuckle rumbling in his chest. “I’ll be. The kid from Cairns. On the big stage.” He came around the counter and pulled her into a rough, awkward hug that smelled of oil and metal dust. “That’s… that’s fantastic, Cass. Bloody fantastic.”
The relief of telling someone, of making it real by speaking it aloud, was immense. The tension in her shoulders finally released. “I know! I can’t believe it. The Opera House, Len. Me!”
“We’ll have to watch it on the telly in the shop,” he said, his smile widening. “Get a case of XXXX Gold, make a night of it. The whole town’ll be rootin’ for you.”

The euphoria carried her through the rest of the day. She floated through her afternoon shift at the coffee shop, serving flat whites and banana bread with a dazed smile. She over-poured the milk, gave away free muffins, and sang quiet harmonies with the café’s tinny radio, earning her more than a few strange looks from her manager. She didn’t care. Nothing could touch her.

The crash came later, back in her tiny, rented room above a laundromat. The room was always damp, and the rhythmic, sloshing thunder of the machines below was the constant soundtrack to her life. With the initial supernova of joy starting to fade, the cold, hard realities began to creep in. She opened the email again on her phone, the screen casting a pale blue light in the gloom. This time, her eyes snagged on a different section, a part she’d scrolled right past in her earlier excitement. ‘Travel and Accommodation’. A hyperlink. She clicked it.

A webpage loaded. ‘Contestant Resources’. There were suggestions for hotels near the venue, with helpful corporate discount codes. There were maps. And there was a section on travel. ‘Contestants are responsible for their own travel arrangements to and from Sydney.’ The sentence was bland, corporate, and utterly devastating. It was a brick wall dropping from a clear blue sky. She scrolled down, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. Train schedules. Cairns to Sydney. A three-day journey, winding down the coast. Her eyes scanned the page, looking for the numbers. And then she found them. Economy sleeper. Return ticket. The price blinked at her from the screen. It was a number so far outside her reality that it might as well have been the distance to the moon.

She dropped her phone on the lumpy mattress. The number seemed to hang in the air, mocking her. She stood up and walked to the small, grimy window, looking out at the alley. The air was thick with the smell of frangipani and fried food from the noodle house down the street. She did the math in her head, the quick, desperate arithmetic of the perpetually broke. Her rent was due on Friday. She had seventy-four dollars in her bank account. Her last paycheck had already been swallowed by bills and a new bike chain. She earned just enough from the café to keep her in instant noodles and second-hand paperbacks, and to keep The Pelican on the road. A fare like that… it wasn’t a stretch. It was a journey to another galaxy.

The joy from the morning, so bright and hot, had curdled into a cold, heavy lump in her gut. Sydney. The Opera House. The live orchestra. It was a beautiful, impossible mirage. She could see it, shimmering there on the horizon, but she was stranded in the desert with an empty canteen. The sloshing of the washing machines below suddenly sounded like a taunt. Round and round, going nowhere. Just like her. She sank onto the edge of her bed, the springs groaning in protest. Her head fell into her hands. The ghost in her throat was silent. There was nothing to sing about.

A song drifted up from a car passing in the street below, its stereo cranked to full. It was a soaring, female power ballad, the kind of thing that usually made Cass roll her eyes. But this one… this one was different. The melody snagged on something deep inside her, a hook in a place she didn't know existed. It was instantly, terribly familiar. A wave of vertigo washed over her, so strong she had to grip the edge of the mattress to steady herself. Her head throbbed, a sharp, piercing pain behind her right eye. The singer’s voice was clear and powerful, but underneath it, Cass could almost hear another voice. A voice that sounded impossibly, terrifyingly, like her own. The feeling was gone as quickly as it came, leaving her breathless and shaking, the pain in her head fading to a dull ache. She shook her head, trying to clear it. Just a weird moment. Stress. Lack of food. That had to be it. It was a famous song, that's all. She’d probably heard it a thousand times without noticing. But the feeling lingered: a profound and unsettling sense of dislocation, as if she'd just heard a message from a stranger who knew all of her secrets. She didn't own a trophy, not a single one. Not for cycling, not for anything. There was a dusty, generic-looking glass music award on the bookshelf, but it had been there when she moved in, part of the clutter left by a previous tenant. She'd always meant to throw it out. Now, her eyes were drawn to it. A carved glass treble clef on a small wooden base. It was cheap, probably a regional prize from some long-forgotten Eisteddfod. It had never meant anything. But as she stared at it, the memory of the song in the street echoed in her head, and for a heart-stopping second, the ugly glass trophy seemed to glow with a significance that made her feel sick.She pushed herself off the bed, drawn by an invisible string towards the dusty bookshelf. The trophy sat between a dog-eared copy of a Zen cycling manual and a stack of old utility bills. It was tacky, the kind of thing you’d win in a pub karaoke competition. A thick glass treble clef, flecked with tiny air bubbles, glued crookedly onto a dark, cheap-looking plinth. She’d used it as a bookend, a doorstop. Now it felt like a radioactive object, pulsing with a sick, green energy only she could see. Her hand trembled as she reached for it. The glass was cool and surprisingly heavy. She had wiped it down once or twice when the dust got too thick, but she had never, not once, picked it up and truly examined it.

She turned it over in her hands. There, on the front of the wooden base, was a small, tarnished brass plaque. It was so dull she’d always assumed it was blank. Now, catching the weak light from the alley window, faint etchings were visible. She squinted, rubbing at the grime with her thumb. The metal was cool against her skin. Slowly, letters began to emerge from the tarnish. First a C, then an A. Her breath caught in her throat. She rubbed harder, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. The full inscription was stark and undeniable. ‘Cassandra Daley – Outstanding Vocalist – 2014’.

The trophy slipped from her numb fingers, landing with a muffled thud on the threadbare carpet. 2014. She stared at the name, her own name, and a year that was a complete and utter void. She tried to grab a memory, any memory, from that year. A picture, a feeling, a place. There was nothing. It was a black hole in her timeline. She knew she’d been in Cairns then, she’d worked at a different cafe, had a different flatmate. But the details were foggy, indistinct, like a story someone else had told her. Winning a singing award? It was impossible. She would remember that. Wouldn't she? The singing was a ghost, a thing that happened *to* her. She’d never chased it, never entered a competition before this one. She’d never even sung in front of anyone but strangers on a street corner, and even then, only when the impulse was too strong to ignore.

The pain behind her eye returned, a sharp, insistent spike. The song from the street, the trophy, the black hole in her memory—they were all connected, tangled threads of a story she didn't know she was in. She stumbled back and sat heavily on the bed, the groaning springs a counterpoint to the thumping in her head. This wasn't just about money anymore. This wasn't about a singing competition. A cold dread, far deeper than the worry about a train fare, seeped into her bones. It was the feeling of standing on a cliff edge you hadn't realised was crumbling beneath your feet. The girl who sang on a stage in 2014, who was good enough to win an award, was a stranger to her. And if she didn’t know that girl, what else did she not know about herself?

She couldn't stay in that room. The four walls felt like they were closing in, the rhythmic churn of the washing machines below a mocking, relentless engine driving her mad. She needed air. She needed speed. She needed to feel the familiar, honest pain in her muscles that told her she was real, that her body was her own. She grabbed her keys and fled, clattering down the back stairs and into the humid night. The Pelican was waiting where she’d left it, leaning against the wall of the laundromat. She swung a leg over the frame, the worn leather of the saddle a familiar comfort. She didn't have a destination. She just rode. Away from the trophy, away from the name on the plaque, away from the gaping hole in her past. She pedalled furiously, heading out of the city, towards the dark, winding roads that climbed into the rainforest, her lungs burning, her thighs screaming, chasing a silence that the ghost in her throat refused to grant.Chapter 2

The darkness outside Cairns was absolute. As Cass pushed inland, leaving the coastal glow behind, the world dissolved into the narrow tunnel carved by her bike light. The air, still thick and soupy, now carried the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves from the rainforest that pressed in on both sides of the road. The rhythmic thrum of cicadas was a deafening, electric wall of sound that her whirring chain and heavy breathing could not penetrate. This was usually her peace, a meditative state where the only things that mattered were the gradient of the road and the cadence of her pedalling. But tonight, the familiar burn in her legs was a dull, distant ache compared to the frantic, screaming panic in her mind. The trophy felt like a lead weight in the pocket of her cycling jersey, pulling her down, a physical anchor to a past she couldn’t access.

She began to climb, the road snaking upwards into the range. Her body protested, lungs heaving, but she welcomed the pain, leaning into it, trying to use the physical agony to cauterise the mental wound. The name on the plaque echoed with every rotation of the cranks. *Cassandra Daley. 2014. Cassandra Daley. 2014.* Who was she? A girl who stood on a stage and accepted a prize, a girl who could sing without it being a strange and involuntary act. A girl who had apparently been erased. The headache that had started in the library returned with a vengeance, a sharp, drilling sensation behind her eye. For a split second, the beam of her headlight seemed to refract, splintering into a kaleidoscope of brilliant, coloured spots. She felt a phantom warmth on her face, like stage lights, and the metallic taste of adrenaline filled her mouth. She gasped, swerving slightly, the front wheel of The Pelican skittering on a loose stone.

The vision, or whatever it was, vanished, leaving her heart jackhammering against her ribs. She was slick with sweat, but a cold chill washed over her that had nothing to do with the night air. She couldn’t outrun this. She couldn’t climb her way out of it. The memory, the truth, whatever it was, wasn't behind her; it was inside her, tangled in her DNA. She crested the hill, her momentum spent, and came to a stop, one foot on the ground. Below, the lights of Cairns and the dark expanse of the Coral Sea were a smear of gold and black. It looked like a foreign country. She felt like a tourist in her own life. With a ragged sigh that was half sob, she turned the bike around. The descent was slow, her fingers trembling on the brake levers, the usual exhilarating rush replaced by a heavy sense of dread. There was only one place to go.

The alleyway behind Rusty’s Bike Shed was a familiar sanctuary, smelling of old rubber, spray paint, and Len’s perpetually brewing coffee. A single light burned in the workshop window. Cass let The Pelican fall against the brick wall and knocked on the heavy metal door, the sound unnaturally loud in the late-night quiet. After a moment, the lock scraped open and the door creaked inwards. Len stood there, silhouetted against the light, his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose. He took in her appearance—the dirt-streaked face, the wild eyes, the way she held herself as if braced for a physical blow.
“Christ, Cass,” he said, his gruff voice laced with concern. “You look like you’ve been wrestling crocodiles. I thought you’d be out celebrating.”

She couldn’t form a proper sentence. The ride hadn’t helped. It had only churned up the fear and confusion until it was a thick sludge in her throat. Wordlessly, she pulled the tacky glass trophy from her jersey pocket and held it out to him. Her hand was shaking so badly the cheap brass plaque rattled against the wooden base. Len took it, his brow furrowed in confusion. He held it under the bare bulb of the workshop light, squinting.
“What’s this? Some kind of early prize?” he asked, turning it over. “Bit cheap for a national competition, isn’t it?”
“Read the plaque, Len,” she whispered, her voice hoarse.
He angled it to the light, his thumb rubbing away the last of the grime she had missed. He was silent for a long moment, his lips moving silently as he read the inscription. He read it again. He looked from the trophy to her face, and then back to the trophy. The confusion on his face slowly morphed into something else, a deep, troubled recognition.
“2014,” he said, the words flat and heavy. “I’ll be damned.”

“You remember?” The question burst out of her, desperate. “Len, do you remember this? Do you remember me singing back then?”
He didn't answer right away. He walked back to his workbench and set the trophy down carefully, next to a dismantled derailleur. He picked up his greasy rag and began wiping his hands, a nervous, repetitive gesture. “I remember that year,” he said finally, his gaze fixed on the concrete floor. “It was the year you got the Pelican. Found it at a scrap yard, remember? A rusted wreck. We spent a month rebuilding it.” He looked up at her, and his pale eyes were full of a sadness she’d never seen there before. “And yeah. I remember the singing. You did it more back then. On the radio in here, you’d hum along. Sometimes you’d just be sitting there, fixing a puncture, and you’d… start. It was different. Less like a ghost, more like breathing.”
The air in the workshop was suddenly thin, hard to breathe. “So what happened?” Cass asked, her voice cracking. “Why don’t I remember this? Winning this thing?”
Len sighed, a long, weary sound. “There was an accident, Cass.” He said the word gently, as if it were a fragile, dangerous thing. “Nothing major. A stupid prang on your bike, down near the marina. A tourist in a campervan who wasn't looking. You got knocked off, hit your head. You were… off, for a while after. Quiet. We all just figured you were shaken up. And after that, the singing just… stopped. You never mentioned it again. Never sang a note. I figured you’d just lost the heart for it. I never pushed.”

An accident. A head injury. The pieces clicked into place with a sickening finality. The black hole in her memory, the headaches, the weird, disconnected feeling she got when she sang. It wasn’t a ghost. It was a trauma. It was a part of her brain that had been bruised and broken and cordoned off. The girl who won that trophy hadn’t been erased; she’d been locked away in a dark room in Cass’s own mind, and the competition, the email, the song on the street—they were all rattling the door.
“The competition,” she said, more to herself than to Len. “Sydney. I have to go.” The words weren't a statement of ambition anymore. They were a declaration of need. The daze had been replaced by a sharp, terrifying clarity. The grand final wasn’t the destination. It was a signpost, pointing her back towards the person she used to be. The answers weren’t in Cairns. They were somewhere on that stage, under those lights, in front of that orchestra.
Len watched her, his expression a mixture of pity and pride. He saw the shift in her, the fear coalescing into a steely resolve he knew all too well. It was the same look she got at the start of a punishing hill climb. “The money,” he said quietly, bringing the devastating, practical reality crashing back down.
Cass’s newfound determination faltered for a second. The brick wall was still there. The impossible number on the train booking website. “I know,” she said, her shoulders slumping. “I don’t have it. It’s impossible.”
Len was quiet, his gaze roaming around the cluttered workshop, a place where impossible mechanical problems were solved every day with ingenuity, grease, and sheer force of will. He looked at the half-built frames hanging from hooks, at the rows of neatly organized tools on the pegboard, at the years of grit and oil ground into the workbench. His eyes finally came to rest on The Rusty Pelican, leaning where she’d left it by the door, its battered frame gleaming dully under the single light.
“Nothing’s impossible, kid,” he said, his voice low and steady. He picked up a wrench, tapping it thoughtfully against his palm. “It’s just a problem. And we’re good at solving problems.”**Chapter 2**

“Nothing’s impossible, kid,” he said, his voice low and steady. He picked up a wrench, tapping it thoughtfully against his palm. “It’s just a problem. And we’re good at solving problems.” He nodded towards The Pelican. “That bike has carried you thousands of kilometres. It’s about time it carried you to Sydney.”

Cass stared at him, uncomprehending. “What are you talking about? I can’t ride to Sydney in three weeks.”
“No, not literally.” A slow, calculating grin spread across Len’s face, the kind he got when he figured out how to fix a particularly stubborn gear-shifting issue. He pointed the wrench at her. “But the idea of it can. The story. 'Local girl with a killer voice and an old bike needs to get to the big show.' People love that stuff. We’ll do a fundraiser. A community ride. We’ll get every cyclist in Cairns who owes me a favour, and that’s a lot of cyclists, to put their money where their mouth is.”
He was already moving, his lethargy gone, replaced by a crackling energy. He grabbed a notepad and a biro from the workbench. “We’ll call it ‘The Pelican’s Song’. We’ll do a big one. The Gillies Range ride. Next Sunday. That gives us a week and a half to get the word out. People sponsor you to do the climb. They sponsor the whole damn peloton. We’ll get the local paper on it, maybe the radio. We’ll set up a fundraising page online. We’re not asking for a handout, Cass. We’re asking people to back one of their own. To invest in the effort. It’s honest. Just like your bike.”

The sheer audacity of the plan left Cass speechless. It was crazy, impulsive, and so quintessentially Len that she could feel a hysterical laugh bubbling up alongside the tears of relief that were pricking her eyes. The cycling community in Cairns was a tight-knit tribe, a sprawling, informal family bound by a shared love of sweat, early mornings, and good coffee. Len was its unofficial patriarch. If he put the call out, they would answer.
“You think… you think it would work?” she stammered.
“I know it will,” he said, not looking up from his furious scribbling. “Now, stop standing there looking like a stunned mullet. We’ve got work to do. First call is to Sally at the paper. She owes me for fixing her kid’s trike.”

The next week was a whirlwind, a blur of motion and goodwill that swept Cass along in its current. Len was a force of nature. His grimy workshop became campaign headquarters. The phone rang off the hook. Cyclists, old and young, Lycra-clad roadies and mud-spattered mountain bikers, dropped by constantly, pressing crumpled cash into a collection tin on the counter or asking for the link to the fundraising page Len had convinced a tech-savvy teenager to build. The local newspaper ran a story on the front page of its weekend edition: a grainy photo of Cass, looking shell-shocked, holding The Rusty Pelican, under the headline ‘CAN CAIRNS SEND OUR CASS TO SYDNEY?’

She felt strangely detached from it all, a passenger in a story that was being written about someone else. While Len orchestrated the campaign, Cass rode. She had to be ready for the Gillies Range climb, a notoriously brutal ascent that was a benchmark for every serious local cyclist. She rode every day, pushing her body harder than ever before, the familiar ache in her muscles a welcome distraction. But the distraction was only temporary. The more she pushed her body, the more her mind seemed to crack open. The phantom sensations grew more frequent, more intense. Climbing a steep section of road, the sun beating down, she would suddenly be blinded by an imagined spotlight, the roar of blood in her ears momentarily replaced by a vivid swell of orchestral music. A deep, resonant cello note would vibrate through her bones, and she’d feel a jolt of stage fright so real she’d have to stop, gasping for air, her hands clamped over her ears until the real world—the buzzing insects, the wind in the trees—rushed back in.

On the day of the big ride, the car park at the base of the range was a festival of colour and noise. Over a hundred cyclists had turned up, a sea of bright jerseys and gleaming carbon-fibre frames. The Rusty Pelican, with its battered steel and worn decals, looked anachronistic, an artifact from another era. But it was the star of the show. People came up to pat its top tube, to take photos with Cass, wishing her luck with a genuine warmth that was both overwhelming and deeply moving. Len gave her a final, fierce hug. “Just ride your ride, kid,” he grunted, his voice thick with emotion. “We’ll take care of the rest.”

The climb was an hour of glorious, punishing hell. Cass rode in the heart of the peloton, surrounded by a moving wall of friends and strangers, their collective effort a tangible force propelling her up the mountain. The sound of dozens of bikes, the rhythmic click of gears, the shared, ragged breathing, it all merged into a single, powerful symphony of work. As she neared the summit, the point where the road levels off before the final push, it happened again, but this time more powerfully than ever before. The world went white. The burn in her legs vanished, replaced by a strange, floating sensation. She could hear a voice, clear as a bell in her head, singing a melody she knew with every fibre of her being. It was her voice, but younger, purer, soaring with a confidence she couldn’t fathom. She saw a face in the crowd—a woman’s face, tears streaming down it, mouthing the words ‘I’m so proud.’ A mother’s face.

The vision shattered as a rider beside her shouted, “Nearly there, Cass! You’ve got this!” The real world slammed back into her. She was on her bike, her lungs on fire, her own face wet, though whether with sweat or tears she couldn’t tell. She grit her teeth and pushed through the pain, cresting the summit to a cheer from the crowd that had gathered at the top. She had done it. She collapsed over her handlebars, body screaming, but for the first time, the ghost in her head hadn't been a terrifying spectre. It had been a guide. It had been her. That night, back at the workshop, they counted the money. The collection tin, the online donations, the cash stuffed into Len’s pockets. It was more than enough. The train fare, a cheap hotel, food for a week. It was all there, a testament to a small town’s big heart, lying in messy piles on the workbench. Cass stared at the money, the physical proof that she was going, and felt a profound wave of terror wash over her, colder and deeper than any she had felt before. The external problem was solved. Now all that was left was the journey inward, a trip into a past she couldn't remember, to reclaim a voice she didn't understand. She was going to Sydney. And she was utterly, completely, terrified of who she might be when she arrived.**Chapter 3**

The Cairns Railway Station felt like a stage set for a play she hadn't rehearsed. The grand, colonial-style building, with its sweeping verandas and iron lacework, stood in humid opposition to the raw, functional world of Rusty's Bike Shed. Len stood with her on the platform, looking uncharacteristically small and out of place without a wrench in his hand. He’d insisted on driving her, his old ute rattling and groaning the whole way, the bed filled with well-wishes from the cycling crew in the form of a new backpack and a box of non-perishable snacks. He kept adjusting his cap, his gaze darting from Cass to the long, silver snake of the train waiting at the platform. The air between them was thick with unspoken words.

“Right then,” he said finally, shoving his hands in his pockets. “You got the ticket. You got the hotel address. You got enough muesli bars to survive a zombie apocalypse.” He looked her square in the eye, his own pale blue ones shimmering slightly under the harsh station lights. “Don’t go thinkin’ you have to win, Cass. That’s not the point. The point is you get on the stage. You look the ghost in the eye and you open your mouth. Whatever comes out, that’s a win. You hear me?” She nodded, a lump forming in her throat too big to speak around. He pulled her into another one of his awkward, oil-and-steel hugs, thumping her on the back a little too hard. “The whole town’s rootin’ for you, kid. Don’t forget it.” And with that, he turned and walked away, not looking back, leaving Cass alone with her backpack, her ticket to another life, and the mournful blast of the train’s horn announcing its imminent departure.

Finding her economy sleeper compartment was like navigating the innards of a metal worm. The space was tiny, a miracle of cramped engineering with a narrow seat that would later convert into a bed, and a window that looked out onto the fading light of the afternoon. As the train lurched into motion, the familiar green of the cane fields and the dark, brooding mountains of the Great Dividing Range began to slide past. Cairns, her home, her sanctuary, her cage, shrank behind her. For the first few hours, a strange sense of peace settled over her. The rhythmic clatter of the wheels on the track was a hypnotic drumbeat, a mechanical mantra. She was in motion, a state she understood. She was no longer waiting, no longer fundraising, no longer spiralling in her tiny room. She was on her way.

The peace, however, was fragile. As dusk bled into a deep, starless night, the reflection of the cabin’s small light turned her window into a mirror. She saw a pale, thin-faced stranger with haunted eyes staring back. The train was a sensory deprivation tank on wheels, stripping away all the familiar distractions of her life in Cairns, leaving her utterly alone with the one thing she had been trying to outrun: herself. The headache started as a dull throb behind her right eye, a familiar harbinger. She closed her eyes, trying to focus on the rocking of the train, but it was no use. The motion was a key, unlocking doors in her mind she didn't know were there. A flicker of memory, brighter than before. She was standing in a narrow hallway, her back pressed against floral wallpaper. Light spilled from a doorway ahead. She could hear music, not an orchestra, but a single acoustic guitar, playing a simple, heartbreaking chord progression. And the voice again. Her voice. Singing. ‘*...and all the king’s horses and all the king’s men...*’ The lyric hung in her mind, a broken fragment of a forgotten nursery rhyme twisted into a lament. Then, the woman’s face from the summit vision appeared, sharp and clear for a heart-stopping second. It *was* her mother. Younger, a little fuller in the face, but unmistakably her. Her name was Joanne. The knowledge surfaced with the same shocking certainty as her own name. Joanne. Mum. And she was crying, not with pride, but with a deep, wrenching sorrow.

Cass’s eyes snapped open, her breath coming in ragged gasps. She was drenched in a cold sweat, her heart rabbiting against her ribs. The compartment felt suffocating, the walls closing in. The memory wasn't a guide; it was a threat. It felt soaked in a grief she couldn’t place. Why would her mother be crying like that? She stumbled out of her compartment and into the narrow corridor, leaning her forehead against the cool glass of the connecting door. The train rattled on through the darkness, indifferent. The question of the song for the final, which had been a low-level anxiety, now became a source of sheer terror. The producers had emailed, asking for her selection so the orchestra could prepare the arrangement. Every song she considered felt like a lie. A pop song felt hollow. A power ballad felt like a costume she couldn’t fill. The only song that felt true was the one she couldn't remember, the one that echoed from that dark room in her mind.

The next two days passed in a strange, timeless limbo. The landscape flattened, the lush green of Queensland giving way to the drier, dustier browns of New South Wales. She ate Len's muesli bars without tasting them, staring out the window for hours, watching small towns and lonely farmhouses drift by like ghosts. She felt suspended between worlds, belonging neither to the one she’d left nor the one she was hurtling towards. The memory flashes continued to ambush her. The feel of a guitar pick between her fingers. The smell of hairspray and stage dust. A heated argument in a car, her own voice, sharp and angry, her mother’s, pleading. Each fragment was a puzzle piece from a picture she couldn't bear to see completed. The joy of being in the final had been completely consumed by the dread of remembering why she had forgotten.

The train’s arrival at Sydney’s Central Station was a physical assault. After three days of rhythmic quiet, the cacophony of the city—the screech of train brakes, the echoing announcements, the roar of a thousand simultaneous conversations—was deafening. The crowd surged around her, a river of impassive, hurried faces, and for a moment, the sheer, crushing anonymity of it all made her want to turn and fight her way back onto the train. She was a tiny, insignificant speck in a vast, concrete universe. Following a map on her phone, she navigated the crowded streets to her hotel, a budget establishment tucked away in a side street, smelling faintly of bleach and old carpet. Her room was small, clean, and utterly soulless. It looked out onto a brick wall.

She dropped her backpack on the floor and sat on the edge of the stiff, neatly-made bed. The silence in the room was louder than the noise of the city. Back in Cairns, the hum of the laundromat, the call of curlews, the distant thrum of a boat on the Trinity Inlet—it was a silence filled with life. This was the dead silence of a vacuum. She felt untethered, a kite cut from its string, drifting in a hostile sky. The weight of it all—Len's faith, the town’s money, the looming stage of the Opera House, the terrifying mystery of her own past—crashed down on her. She pulled out her phone, her thumb hovering over Len’s number. She could call him. She could tell him she couldn’t do it. That the ghost had won. That she was a fraud who couldn’t even remember her own songs. But as she stared at the screen, another image bloomed behind her eyes, unbidden. It was the trophy. Not the tacky glass one from her bookshelf, but another one. Heavier. Colder. Metal. And she was on a stage, not a small regional one, but a bigger one, brighter. And the feeling that came with it wasn't sorrow or fear. It was a dizzying, electric surge of triumph. A feeling so powerful, so addictive, it was like a drug. She remembered the feeling of deserving it. The ghost in her throat wasn't just a spectre of trauma; it was the echo of an ambition she had once possessed, an ambition so fierce it had apparently broken her. And she knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that the only way to silence the ghost for good was to get back on that stage and feed it.**Chapter 4**

The next morning, the Sydney Opera House wasn't a myth; it was a challenge. Cass walked from her hotel through the Botanic Gardens, the unfamiliar squawks of city birds replacing the call of the curlews she knew. The famous white sails rose above the trees, a series of impossible, sun-drenched curves against the brilliant blue of the harbour. It was beautiful, so perfect it looked computer-generated, and it filled her with a profound sense of alienation. She, with her rusty bike and second-hand clothes, had no business being here. She felt like a barnacle trying to attach itself to a pearl. Her seventy-four dollars, which had once felt like a survival fund, now felt like nothing, a handful of dust in a city that glittered with effortless wealth. The closer she got, the more her footsteps slowed, the weight of the building seeming to press down on her, each shell a giant, silent judge.

Backstage was a disorienting labyrinth of grey corridors, numbered doors, and cables taped to the floor like cryptic maps. The air hummed with a low-level, professional urgency. People with lanyards and headsets strode past with an air of controlled chaos, their conversations a clipped jargon she couldn't decipher. She was directed to a large, brightly lit green room where the other finalists were gathered. The contrast with her solitary journey was jarring. There was a boy band, all gleaming teeth and meticulously styled hair, laughing loudly in one corner. A girl barely out of her teens, with the poise of a seasoned professional, was scrolling through her phone with a bored expression. A burly country singer with a kind face and an enormous hat gave Cass a friendly nod. They were all so polished, so ready. They looked like they belonged. Cass felt like she had snuck in through a side door, her charity-case backpack a glaring statement of her otherness.

A woman with a sharp bob and an even sharper smile detached herself from a conversation and glided towards Cass. “Cass Daley! I’m Eliza, your producer. So thrilled to finally meet you. We are just obsessed with your voice. That raw, authentic quality? Money can’t buy that.” Her voice was effusive, but her eyes were calculating, scanning Cass from head to toe as if estimating her market value. “We have you scheduled for a session with Marcus, our head vocal coach, in ten minutes. But first, the big question. We need your song choice for the final. The orchestra is waiting.” The question hung in the air, a final exam she hadn’t studied for. Cass’s mouth went dry. All the songs she had half-considered evaporated from her mind, flimsy and inadequate.

“I’m… still deciding,” she mumbled, looking at the floor.
Eliza’s smile tightened infinitesimally. “Well, the deadline is, well, now. The arrangers are on a very tight schedule. Have you got a shortlist?”
Cass’s mind was a frantic, blank space. The memory of the angry argument in the car flickered. The pleading in her mother’s voice. She couldn’t sing a love song. She couldn’t sing a pop anthem. They were lies. “I don’t know,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. The shame was a hot flush on her cheeks.
Eliza’s patience was clearly wearing thin. She exchanged a quick, frustrated glance with an assistant. “Okay. Look. Why don’t you have your session with Marcus? Let’s see what he can get out of you. But Cass,” she leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial but firm tone, “We need that song by the end of the day. No exceptions.”

The rehearsal studio was a quiet, soundproofed room with a grand piano at its centre. Marcus, the vocal coach, was a stark contrast to Eliza. He was an older man with a weary, intelligent face and hands that looked like they belonged to a sculptor. He didn't offer platitudes or false enthusiasm. He simply gestured to the microphone stand in the middle of the room. “Eliza tells me you’re the ‘raw talent’,” he said, his voice a low, gravelly baritone. “Let’s hear it. Sing a scale for me. Middle C.” Cass’s hands were trembling as she stood before the microphone. It felt like an instrument of interrogation. She took a breath and sang the scale. The notes came out, but they felt thin, reedy, disconnected from her body. The ghost was being shy.

Marcus listened, his head tilted, his eyes closed. “Hmm. It’s in there. But you’re strangling it. It’s like you’re singing from behind a door. What are you afraid of?” The question was so direct, so devoid of industry fluff, that it hit her like a physical blow. She had no answer. He walked to the piano. “Let’s try something else. Forget the notes. I’m going to play a chord. I want you to find a note inside it, any note, and just hold it. Don’t think. Just let the sound come out.” He played a chord, a rich, melancholy minor chord that seemed to fill the room and vibrate right through the floor into the soles of her feet. It was terribly, achingly familiar.

She closed her eyes and opened her mouth. And it happened. Not a flash this time, but a full, immersive plunge. The sterile studio dissolved. She was in a car, the smell of old upholstery and cheap air freshener filling her senses. Rain was streaking down the windows, the wipers beating a frantic, hypnotic rhythm. Her mother, Joanne, was driving, her knuckles white on the steering wheel. The metal trophy, heavy and cold, was on Cass’s lap. It wasn’t a cheap glass treble clef; it was a solid, gleaming silver statuette, a national youth songwriting award. The joy of winning it, the pure, electric triumph, had already curdled into something ugly.
“It’s too much, Cassie,” her mother was saying, her voice strained, pleading. “This obsession. You haven’t slept, you barely eat. You’re fifteen! This isn’t healthy.”
“You just don’t get it!” The voice that ripped out of her was her own, but it was younger, sharper, cruel with the arrogance of teenage certainty. “You’re scared. You’re scared I’m going to be somebody, and you’re still just… here.”
“That’s not true,” her mother sobbed, and the sound was the one that had haunted Cass’s waking nightmares. “I’m scared of what this is doing to you! I’m scared of losing you.”
“You’re losing me anyway!” she had screamed.
A horn blared. Headlights, huge and blinding, filled the windscreen. Her mother screamed her name—*Cassie!*—and wrenched the wheel. There was the sickening crunch of metal, the explosive shatter of glass, and a sudden, violent darkness.

Cass’s own scream was a raw, guttural cry of pure terror. She was on her knees on the floor of the rehearsal studio, her hands clamped over her head, the phantom sound of shattering glass still ringing in her ears. The chord from the piano had stopped. Marcus was kneeling in front of her, his face a mask of alarm. “Cass? Cass, what is it? What happened?” Her body was shaking uncontrollably. The accident. It wasn't a campervan. It wasn't a minor prang. It was her. Her ambition, her anger, her cruel words had put them in that car, had caused that crash. The black hole in her memory wasn’t protecting her from a head injury; it was protecting her from the guilt. The ghost in her throat wasn’t just a trauma. It was a penance. It was her mother’s voice, her mother’s fear, tangled up with her own.

“My mother,” she choked out, the words tasting like ash. “The accident… it was my fault.” Marcus didn’t say anything. He just put a steadying hand on her shoulder, a silent, grounding presence in the swirling vortex of her rediscovered past. After a long moment, the violent shaking began to subside, replaced by a deep, shuddering cold. She had pushed and pushed until she had broken everything. Her mother. Herself. Her music. The song she had won the award with, the song she had screamed about in the car, was the epicentre of it all. She remembered its title. She remembered its chorus. It was a song about being broken and unfixable. She had written it as a dramatic teenager, never imagining it would become a prophecy.

She got to her feet, her legs unsteady. She felt scoured out, hollowed, but also strangely, terrifyingly lucid. The fear was still there, a cold, heavy stone in her gut, but it was no longer a shapeless dread. It had a name, and a face, and a history. She looked at Marcus, at the deep, unexpected compassion in his eyes. Then she looked past him, towards the door, as if she could see Eliza and the whole machinery of the show waiting on the other side. She took a breath, the first real, deep breath she had taken in years. The ghost was no longer a whisper. It was a roar. And it was waiting. When Eliza bustled back in a few minutes later, her face a mask of impatient inquiry, Cass was ready. She stood tall, her hands no longer trembling, and met the producer’s gaze. “I have my song,” she said, her voice clear and steady. “It’s called ‘All The King’s Horses’.”
Eliza’s face brightened. “Great! Who’s it by?”
Cass held her gaze. “It’s by me.”**Chapter 4**

The next morning, the Sydney Opera House wasn't a myth; it was a challenge. Cass walked from her hotel through the Botanic Gardens, the unfamiliar squawks of city birds replacing the call of the curlews she knew.

It was her mother’s voice, her mother’s fear, tangled up with her own.

“My mother,” she choked out, the words tasting like ash. “The accident… it was my fault.” Marcus didn’t say anything. He just put a steadying hand on her shoulder, a silent, grounding presence in the swirling vortex of her rediscovered past. After a long moment, the violent shaking began to subside, replaced by a deep, shuddering cold. She had pushed and pushed until she had broken everything. Her mother. Herself. Her music. The song she had won the award with, the song she had screamed about in the car, was the epicentre of it all. She remembered its title. She remembered its chorus. It was a song about being broken and unfixable. She had written it as a dramatic teenager, never imagining it would become a prophecy.

She got to her feet, her legs unsteady. She felt scoured out, hollowed, but also strangely, terrifyingly lucid. The fear was still there, a cold, heavy stone in her gut, but it was no longer a shapeless dread. It had a name, and a face, and a history. She looked at Marcus, at the deep, unexpected compassion in his eyes. Then she looked past him, towards the door, as if she could see Eliza and the whole machinery of the show waiting on the other side. She took a breath, the first real, deep breath she had taken in years. The ghost was no longer a whisper. It was a roar. And it was waiting. When Eliza bustled back in a few minutes later, her face a mask of impatient inquiry, Cass was ready. She stood tall, her hands no longer trembling, and met the producer’s gaze. “I have my song,” she said, her voice clear and steady. “It’s called ‘All The King’s Horses’.”
Eliza’s face brightened. “Great! Who’s it by?”
Cass held her gaze. “It’s by me.”**Chapter 5**

Eliza’s professional smile widened into a predatory grin. An original song was narrative gold. “Even better!” she exclaimed, her eyes gleaming. “Amnesia, a lost song, a triumphant return to the stage… the story writes itself! We’ll need to get a camera crew on you ASAP to shoot your backstory package.” She was already talking into her headset, a blur of logistics and scheduling. To her, Cass’s trauma wasn’t a wound; it was a marketable asset, a compelling plot point for the evening’s entertainment. The speed with which her private agony was being packaged for public consumption made Cass feel nauseous, as though she were being field-dressed while still alive.

Marcus stepped between them, a quiet, solid buffer. “Give the kid a minute, Eliza,” he said, his voice low but firm. “She’s not a story. She’s a singer. And she’s just been through the wringer.” He turned to Cass, his gaze cutting through the industry noise. “You’re sure about this? Singing that song?” She met his eyes, a silent understanding passing between them. The song was a poison, but it was also the only antidote she had. A slow, determined nod was her only reply. He nodded back, a flicker of profound respect in his weary face. “Alright then. Let’s get the arranger in here. Sing it for us. Just once. No performance, just the words and the melody. Like you’re telling me a secret.”

The arranger, a young man with kind eyes and a frantic energy, set up a laptop and a portable keyboard. Cass stood before the microphone again, but this time it felt different. It wasn’t an instrument of interrogation; it was a confessional. She closed her eyes, not to block out the world, but to find the one inside her. The memory was no longer a fractured, terrifying assault. It was a whole, coherent story, heavy and dark, and she had to give it voice. She took a breath and began, her voice a reedy, trembling thread of sound in the quiet room. ‘*Cracked a mirror in the hallway / Seven years of lonely Saturdays…*’ The lyrics, written by a fifteen-year-old who only knew melodrama, now felt like a grimly accurate prophecy.

As she sang, the room fell away. She was back in the car, the rain, the fight, the blinding lights. The chorus came, and her voice broke on the words, the sound a raw, ragged edge of grief. ‘*And all the king’s horses and all the king’s men / Couldn’t put me back together again…*’ It was messy, imperfect, and stained with tears she wasn’t aware she was crying until she felt them hot on her cheeks. She sang about being a shattered thing, a Humpty Dumpty at the bottom of the wall, and every word was a shard of glass from the memory of the crash. When she finished, the silence in the studio was absolute, broken only by her own shuddering breaths. The arranger was staring at his keyboard, his hands still. Marcus was watching her, his expression unreadable but for the deep well of sadness in his eyes. He didn’t offer praise or critique. He simply said, “Thank you, Cass. That was honest.”

The honesty, however, was a liability in the slick machine of prime-time television. The days leading up to the final were a strange hell of stylists and interviewers. They pulled and prodded at her, trying to mould her into a more palatable version of her story. A stylist tried to put her in a glittering, sequined gown, but she refused, clinging to the simple black jeans and t-shirt she felt she could breathe in. “It’s part of your brand,” Eliza had insisted. “The raw, earthy look.” It wasn't a brand; it was armour. An interviewer with a practiced, sympathetic voice asked her to recount the accident for the camera, to “share her journey of healing.” Cass stared into the lens, the heat of the lights like a phantom echo of the headlights that had torn her world apart, and gave them nothing but clipped, one-sentence answers, her truth too sacred and too ugly for their soundbites. She was becoming a character: ‘Cass the Survivor’, ‘The Girl Who Forgot’. The more they tried to define her, the more she retreated.

The weight of the unasked question became unbearable. The memory had given her the *what*, but it had ended in a flash of white light and shattering glass. She didn't know the *after*. What happened to her mother? The argument, the cruel words she’d flung, they were the last things she had ever said to her. The guilt was a physical sickness, a constant, low-grade fever that left her drained and hollow. She couldn’t step on that stage, couldn’t sing that song as a confession, without knowing who she was confessing to. She had to make the call. After a long, sleepless night staring at the brick wall outside her hotel window, she found the number. It was for a florist shop in a small coastal town south of Brisbane. A Google search had shown her a picture of the shopfront: ‘Blooms by Jo’. Joanne. Her stomach twisted into a tight, painful knot. Her mother had rebuilt a life around creating beautiful things, while Cass had spent years running from the ugliness she’d caused.

Her finger hovered over the call button for a full minute, her pulse a frantic drum in her ears. She pressed it. The phone rang three times, each one a hammer blow to her already frayed nerves. Then, a voice. “Blooms by Jo, Joanne speaking.” It was her. Older, a little huskier, but unmistakably her mother’s voice. Cass’s own throat closed up. No sound would come out. “Hello?” Joanne said, a hint of impatience in her tone. “Is anyone there?”
“Mum?” The word was a choked, broken whisper, a sound from a ghost.
There was a sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line, then a long, profound silence. For a terrible moment, Cass thought she had hung up. “Cassie?” The name was fragile, as if spoken across a great, fragile distance. “Is that really you?”
“Yeah,” Cass breathed, tears starting to stream down her face. “It’s me. I… I remember. The accident. I remember everything.”
The silence stretched again, thick with eight years of pain and misunderstanding. “Oh, Cassie,” her mother finally said, and her voice was thick with an emotion Cass couldn’t decipher. It wasn’t anger. It was a deep, bone-weary sadness. “I waited so long. I thought you hated me.”
“No,” Cass sobbed, the denial ripping out of her. “I hated myself. I was… I was so stupid. And mean. What I said to you in the car…”
“We both said things we didn’t mean,” Joanne interrupted, her voice gentle but firm. “We were both scared. You were burning so bright you were starting to burn out, and I didn’t know how to stop it.” There was a pause. “Are you alright, Cassie? You don’t sound alright.”
“I’m in Sydney,” Cass said, the words tumbling out. “I’m in the final of a singing competition. The big one. Voice of the Nation. It’s tonight. And I’m singing the song. Our song. ‘All The King’s Horses’.”
This time the silence was one of pure shock. Cass could hear the faint sound of traffic from her mother’s end of the line. When Joanne spoke again, her voice was crystal clear. “You were never broken, Cassie. You were just… bent. You were always so strong. Strong enough to bend yourself out of shape to forget. Maybe you’re strong enough to bend yourself back.” Another pause. “I’m not watching. I haven’t been able to watch those shows since… well, since. But I want you to know something. It was never about the singing. It was about you. It was always just about you.” The line went quiet for a moment. “I’m proud of you, Cassie. For calling.”

Cass didn't remember saying goodbye. She was just sitting on the edge of her bed, the phone still pressed to her ear, the dial tone a monotonous drone. *You were never broken. You were just bent.* The words were a key, unlocking the final door. Her mother’s forgiveness wasn’t a pardon; it was a perspective shift. The song wasn’t a prophecy of irreparable damage. It was a teenager’s lament, a snapshot of a pain that was real but not permanent. Her memory hadn’t locked the trauma away to punish her; it had done it to protect her, to allow the bent parts of her to slowly, painstakingly, straighten out in the quiet rhythm of a simple life. The bike, the miles, the salt and the sweat—it had all been a long, slow, unconscious physiotherapy for her soul.

That evening, as she stood in the wings of the Opera House stage, the roar of the crowd a physical pressure against her chest, the fear was still there. It was a cold, familiar knot in her stomach. But it was no longer in charge. The lights came up. The orchestral introduction began, a new arrangement, soft and full of sorrow and space, that Marcus and the arranger had crafted. It was time. She walked out of the darkness and into the blinding white light. She didn't see the thousands of faces, the cameras, the judges. She saw a long, winding road, a rusty bike, and a small flower shop on a quiet coast. She saw Len’s hopeful, greasy face. She saw her mother. She took her place at the microphone, closed her eyes, and for the first time, she wasn’t fighting the ghost in her throat. She was holding its hand. She took a breath, and she sang.**Chapter 5**

Eliza’s professional smile widened into a predatory grin. An original song was narrative gold. “Even better!” she exclaimed, her eyes gleaming. “Amnesia, a lost song, a triumphant return to the stage… the story writes itself! We’ll need to get a camera crew on you ASAP to shoot your backstory package.” She was already talking into her headset, a blur of logistics and scheduling. To her, Cass’s trauma wasn’t a wound; it was a marketable asset, a compelling plot point for the evening’s entertainment. The speed with which her private agony was being packaged for public consumption made Cass feel nauseous, as though she were being field-dressed while still alive.

Marcus stepped between them, a quiet, solid buffer. “Give the kid a minute, Eliza,” he said, his voice low but firm. “She’s not a story. She’s a singer. And she’s just been through the wringer.” He turned to Cass, his gaze cutting through the industry noise. “You’re sure about this? Singing that song?” She met his eyes, a silent understanding passing between them. The song was a poison, but it was also the only antidote she had. A slow, determined nod was her only reply. He nodded back, a flicker of profound respect in his weary face. “Alright then. Let’s get the arranger in here. Sing it for us. Just once. No performance, just the words and the melody. Like you’re telling me a secret.”

The arranger, a young man with kind eyes and a frantic energy, set up a laptop and a portable keyboard. Cass stood before the microphone again, but this time it felt different. It wasn’t an instrument of interrogation; it was a confessional. She closed her eyes, not to block out the world, but to find the one inside her. The memory was no longer a fractured, terrifying assault. It was a whole, coherent story, heavy and dark, and she had to give it voice. She took a breath and began, her voice a reedy, trembling thread of sound in the quiet room. ‘*Cracked a mirror in the hallway / Seven years of lonely Saturdays…*’ The lyrics, written by a fifteen-year-old who only knew melodrama, now felt like a grimly accurate prophecy.

As she sang, the room fell away. She was back in the car, the rain, the fight, the blinding lights. The chorus came, and her voice broke on the words, the sound a raw, ragged edge of grief. ‘*And all the king’s horses and all the king’s men / Couldn’t put me back together again…*’ It was messy, imperfect, and stained with tears she wasn’t aware she was crying until she felt them hot on her cheeks. She sang about being a shattered thing, a Humpty Dumpty at the bottom of the wall, and every word was a shard of glass from the memory of the crash. When she finished, the silence in the studio was absolute, broken only by her own shuddering breaths. The arranger was staring at his keyboard, his hands still.

That evening, as she stood in the wings of the Opera House stage, the roar of the crowd a physical pressure against her chest, the fear was still there. It was a cold, familiar knot in her stomach. But it was no longer in charge. The lights came up. The orchestral introduction began, a new arrangement, soft and full of sorrow and space, that Marcus and the arranger had crafted. It was time. She walked out of the darkness and into the blinding white light. She didn't see the thousands of faces, the cameras, the judges. She saw a long, winding road, a rusty bike, and a small flower shop on a quiet coast. She saw Len’s hopeful, greasy face. She saw her mother. She took her place at the microphone, closed her eyes, and for the first time, she wasn’t fighting the ghost in her throat. She was holding its hand. She took a breath, and she sang.**Chapter 6**

The first notes from the orchestra were not a grand fanfare, but the soft, hesitant sound of a lone cello, a sound like a question being asked in a vast, empty room. It was the sound of her solitude, the sound of her years in the quiet laundromat room, the sound of a train rattling through a long, dark night. As Cass stepped into the pool of light, she felt the familiar, terrifying warmth on her face, but the phantom pain behind her eye was gone. The audience, a vast, faceless entity in the darkness beyond the stage, seemed to hold its collective breath. They had just watched the slick, choreographed routine of the boy band, all pyrotechnics and perfect harmonies. Cass, in her plain black t-shirt and jeans, was an abrupt, stark silence. She gripped the microphone stand, its cool metal a grounding anchor, and found the single lens of the main camera, imagining it was Len’s pale blue eyes, watching her on a crackly TV in the back of his workshop.

She sang the first line, her voice quieter than anyone expected, a near-whisper that forced twenty million people to lean closer. It wasn't the reedy, fearful sound from the rehearsal room; it was a voice infused with a quiet, devastating certainty. She sang of cracked mirrors and lonely Saturdays, and the melody, the one she had unknowingly carried for eight years, unspooled not as a lament, but as a testimony. The ghost was no longer in her throat; it was standing beside her, and she was telling its story. As the orchestra swelled, her voice rose to meet it, not fighting against the sound but weaving through it. There was no artifice, no vocal gymnastics, no attempt to impress. There was only the truth. The raw, unpolished, honest truth she had chased up and down the Gillies Range.

When the chorus arrived, the moment she had been dreading, the dam of her control didn't break. Instead, it opened. The voice that came out of her was immense, a sound of grief and fury and a sliver of impossible grace. ‘*And all the king’s horses and all the king’s men / Couldn’t put me back together again…*’ The line, which had once been a declaration of her brokenness, was now an anthem of acceptance. It was an acknowledgement of the fall. She sang the words and she didn't shatter. She looked the memory of the crash square in the face and laid it bare for everyone to see. In the control room, Eliza’s cynical smile had vanished, replaced by a look of stunned disbelief. This wasn't the marketable sob story she had planned; it was something far more dangerous and real. It was art.

The song ended as it began, with a single, sustained note from the cello that hung in the air like dust motes in a sunbeam before fading into nothing. For a full ten seconds, the only sound in the cavernous concert hall was the hum of the lights. The silence was not empty; it was heavy, resonant, filled with the emotional shrapnel of her performance. No one seemed to know how to react. A game show had just been hijacked by a confession. Then, a single person began to clap, a slow, deliberate sound. Another joined, then a dozen, then a hundred, until a wave of applause rolled through the auditorium, an ovation that was less about adulation and more about a shared, profound, and deeply uncomfortable recognition. Cass stood perfectly still, her hand still on the microphone stand, tears she was unaware of tracing clean paths through the light sheen of sweat on her face. She hadn't been performing. She had been testifying. And now, she was done.

The judges, usually so quick with their glib pronouncements, were visibly unsettled. The rock star judge cleared his throat twice before speaking. “I… I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that on this stage,” he said, his usual bravado gone. “That wasn’t a performance. That was… a reckoning. Thank you for your honesty, Cass.” The pop starlet was dabbing at her eyes. The industry veteran simply shook his head. “There are singers, and there are artists. You just showed us the difference.” There was no critique of her pitch or her phrasing. To talk about such things would have been a profanity.

Backstage, the other contestants gave her a wide berth, looking at her with a mixture of awe and fear. She had broken the unspoken rules of the competition, which were to be vulnerable, but not *that* vulnerable; to be real, but not *that* real. Marcus was waiting for her just beyond the curtain. He didn't say a word, just handed her a bottle of water and squeezed her shoulder, a gesture that meant more than any standing ovation. The rest of the show passed in a blur. The country singer sang a flawless, heartfelt ballad about his hometown. The final votes were tallied. The host, with his plastic smile and practiced suspense, tore open the envelope. The winner of Voice of the Nation was the country singer. The crowd erupted, confetti cannons fired, and Cass felt a wave of relief so profound it almost buckled her knees. The trophy, the record deal, the whirlwind of manufactured fame—it was his burden now, not hers. She had come for something else entirely, and she had found it.

The train journey home was the mirror image of the one that had brought her here. She sat by the window, but she wasn't staring at her own haunted reflection. She was watching the country scroll by, the dry plains of New South Wales slowly greening as they climbed back towards the tropics. She saw the colours. She heard the conversations of the people around her. The silence in her own mind was no longer a void; it was a quiet, open space. She had walked into the dark room of her past, turned on the light, and found that the monster hiding in the corner was just a scared, fifteen-year-old girl. She hadn't slain the ghost; she had integrated it. It was a part of her story, a scar that proved she had healed. She no longer felt like a tourist in her own life; she felt like she was finally home, even before the train pulled into the station.

Len was there on the platform, leaning against a pillar, exactly where he’d left her. He wasn’t holding a welcome-home sign or a bouquet of flowers. He just watched her walk towards him, taking in the change in the way she held herself, the new stillness in her eyes. He didn’t ask if she’d won. He didn’t need to. He just grunted, “You look tired, kid.”
“I am,” she said, a real smile, easy and unforced, spreading across her face. “The good kind of tired.”
“C’mon,” he said, jerking his head towards the exit. “The whole town saw it. Even put a sign up in the café. ‘Our Cass. Didn’t win. Didn’t matter.’”
Back in the dingy, magical kingdom of the bike shed, he flicked on the small, flickering television on the workbench. He’d recorded the show. He hit play, and her performance filled the screen. Cass watched herself walk into the light, a thin, determined figure against the vastness of the stage. She heard the first notes of the cello. She watched this girl, this stranger who was also herself, and listened as she sang her story. The voice was clear and strong, full of all the cracks and breaks and raw edges that made it hers. It was honest. It was real. When the song finished, Len quietly turned off the TV. He wiped his hands on his greasy rag, then came around the counter and pulled her into a hug that smelled, as always, of oil and metal dust and home. “That’s… that’s fantastic, Cass,” he said, his voice thick. “Bloody fantastic.”

A few days later, the sun rose over the Coral Sea, turning the water from lead to liquid gold. The air was thick enough to drink, a hot, wet towel of a Tuesday morning. For Cass Daley, it was just air. The stuff you breathed. Her lungs were furnaces, her thighs were pistons, and The Rusty Pelican was an extension of her own skeleton. She carved through the sluggish Cairns traffic, a blur of spinning spokes and wiry muscle. This was her element. The singing was her element, too. It wasn't a ghost anymore. It was a melody that lived in her throat, one she could call on whenever she wanted. It was iron and rubber and grease and effort. It was a voice and lungs and memory and forgiveness. It was honest. And as she pedalled towards the rising sun, the salt from the sea air on her face, she began to hum. It wasn't a sad song, or a happy one. It was just a tune, coming out on its own terms, a quiet harmony with the whirring of the wheels. And it was enough.**Chapter 7**

The new normal was quieter than fame, but louder than anonymity. Back behind the counter at the coffee shop, Cass found she had become a minor local landmark, somewhere between the giant fibreglass marlin and the pub that claimed to have the coldest beer in the hemisphere. Tourists who had watched the show would come in, their phones held up ready for a selfie, asking for ‘the singer’s special’ as if it were an item on the menu. Her manager, a man whose emotional range usually ran from hassled to very hassled, now treated her with a kind of baffled reverence, asking if the café’s radio station was to her liking. Cass would smile, murmur a quiet ‘thank you’, and get on with frothing the milk, her movements as economical and practiced as ever. The attention was a strange, ill-fitting garment, and she spent most of her shifts trying to shrug it off, relieved when the lunch rush hit and she could disappear into the simple, demanding rhythm of work.

What had truly changed was internal. The silence in her head was no longer a threat. The ghost had not been vanquished so much as invited to sit down and have a cup of tea. Sometimes, a song would come on the café’s tinny speakers, a melody she knew, and she would find herself singing a soft harmony under her breath as she wiped down the counter. It wasn't the strange, compulsive act it had once been; it was a choice. A small, conscious pleasure. The other staff would sometimes fall quiet to listen, and Cass would just smile, a little shyly, and carry on. The singing was no longer a secret she was keeping even from herself; it was just a part of the air she breathed, as natural as the scent of roasting coffee beans.

The money from the fundraiser, ‘The Pelican’s Song,’ sat in a biscuit tin in Len’s workshop. After the train fare and the cheap hotel, a surprising amount was left over. Len, with gruff ceremony, had declared it ‘The Pelican Fund’, for future emergencies and impossible journeys. For a week, Cass tried to ignore it, feeling as though the goodwill it represented was too immense to touch. But the fund, and the journey it had enabled, had opened a door that she couldn't leave closed. The trip to Sydney had been a reckoning with her past, but the final, most crucial piece of that past lived in a small coastal town a day’s bus ride to the south. The conversation with her mother had stitched the wound, but the scar tissue still felt tight and new. Healing, she was learning, was an active process, like truing a wheel. You had to make the small, patient adjustments yourself.

One sweltering afternoon, she found herself not at the library, but at the bus terminal, its open-air waiting room buzzing with flies and the low hum of idling engines. She stood in front of the timetable, the destinations a list of dusty, sun-bleached Queensland towns. Her eyes found the one she was looking for. It wasn’t a myth like Sydney; it was a real place with a corner store and a post office and a flower shop called ‘Blooms by Jo’. She walked to the counter, the leftover cash from the biscuit tin folded neatly in her pocket, and bought a one-way ticket for the next morning. The journey to Sydney had been about finding herself. This one, she knew, was about finding her mother. It felt infinitely more terrifying, and infinitely more important.

That evening, as she was packing a small bag in her room above the laundromat, her phone buzzed with an unknown Sydney number. A cold spike of dread, a phantom limb of her old anxiety, shot through her. Eliza. The machine wanting another pound of flesh. She almost let it ring out, but the conversation with her mother had left her with a sliver of new courage. She answered, her voice wary. “Hello?”
“Cass? It’s Marcus.” The warm, gravelly voice of the vocal coach was an instant balm. “I hope I’m not disturbing you.”
“No, not at all,” she said, surprised, sinking onto the edge of her bed. “It’s good to hear from you.”
“I was just calling to say… well, to say thank you. What you did on that stage was the bravest thing I’ve seen in a long time. I showed the recording to a friend of mine. Someone who I thought would appreciate it.” There was a pause, a rustle of paper on his end. “He runs a small label. A proper one. The kind that still has analogue tape machines and thinks an album is a body of work, not a collection of singles.”

Cass’s breath caught in her throat. She could hear the rhythmic slosh of the washing machines below, a steady, familiar heartbeat against the sudden, frantic pounding in her own chest. “They’re not interested in the show, Cass,” Marcus continued, his voice gentle, as if handling a fragile object. “They’re interested in the song. They were wondering if you had any others.” The question hung in the humid air of her small room. Did she have other songs? She didn’t know. She had spent so long running from the one, she had never considered there might be more. “They’re not offering a big, shiny contract,” Marcus was saying. “They want to know if you’d be interested in coming down for a few days. To talk. To play them what you have. To maybe record a few demos in a studio that feels more like a living room than a laboratory. No pressure. No stylists. Just a conversation about music.”

The offer was a ghost of a different kind. It was the dream she’d had when she was fifteen, but stripped of the desperate, corrosive ambition. It wasn’t a rocket to stardom; it was a quiet, sunlit path. A chance to build something, not just to win something. A wave of dizziness, a phantom echo of the vertigo she had felt in the library, washed over her. It was the future, a potential future she had never allowed herself to imagine, knocking at her door. “I… I don’t know what to say,” she stammered, her mind racing.
“Don’t say anything yet,” Marcus said kindly. “Just think about it. The offer is real, and it’s open. It’s your story to write now, Cass. You get to decide what the next verse is.”

After she hung up, she didn’t move for a long time. The bus ticket to her mother lay on her bedspread. The offer from Marcus felt like a galaxy away. They were two different futures, two different kinds of healing, pulling her in opposite directions. She grabbed her keys and fled, the need for the familiar comfort of Len’s workshop a magnetic pull. She found him where she always did, silhouetted against the bare bulb, a wheel spinning slowly in his hands. She didn’t have to say much. She laid it all out: the bus ticket south to her mother, the potential plane ticket south to a new song. The past and the future, both demanding a journey. Len didn't look up from his work, his concentration absolute as he plucked a spoke. It made a clear, true *ping*. He slowly adjusted the nipple with his wrench, then plucked it again. He was silent for a long time, the only sound the gentle whir of the freewheel. Finally, he stopped the wheel with his hand and looked at her, his pale eyes clear and direct in the dim light. “Seems to me,” he said, his voice a low rumble, “that one of them’s a journey home, and the other’s a journey out. You just have to decide which one you need to take first.”**Chapter 7**

Len’s words hung in the quiet workshop, as clear and true as the note he’d just struck. *A journey home, and a journey out.* For a moment, Cass felt the familiar pull of the bike, the instinct to escape a difficult choice by disappearing into physical effort. The road was simple; you just had to pedal. But she wasn't that person anymore, not entirely. The road had led her to a crossroads, and now she had to choose a direction. The offer from Marcus was a dream she hadn't dared to have, a validation that went deeper than any televised competition. It was a chance to build a life out of the thing she’d just reclaimed, to shape the ghost into a body of work. But as she pictured the recording studio, the analogue tape machines, the quiet conversation about music, she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that the songs weren't ready. They were still seedlings, fragile things that needed solid ground.

The ground was her mother. The songs would be about survival, but you couldn't sing truthfully about that until you had looked the other survivor in the eye. You couldn't write about forgiveness until you had asked for it. The journey out could wait. It would be richer, truer, if it began from a place of wholeness. The bus ticket lying on her bed was not a detour from her future; it was the first, necessary step towards it. She looked up at Len, the decision settling over her like a calm sea after a storm. “Home first,” she said, her voice quiet but firm. “The music can wait. It’s waited this long.” Len simply nodded, a slow smile spreading across his creased face. He turned back to his wheel, giving it a gentle spin. It spun straight and true, the sound a low, contented hum.

The bus sighed its way out of Cairns the next morning, leaving the humidity and the familiar peaks of the range behind. This journey felt different from the train. There was no sense of being hurtled towards an unknown fate. Cass had a window seat, and as the lush, tropical green gave way to the drier scrubland of Central Queensland, she felt like a conscious observer. She wasn't fleeing a past she couldn't remember, but travelling towards one she had chosen to face. She watched small towns flash by, each with a single pub, a dusty main street, and a water tower proclaiming the town’s name like a lonely sentinel. She saw kids kicking a football in a parched park, an old man sleeping on a verandah, a line of washing flapping in the breeze. They were fragments of lives, real and unpolished, and she felt a quiet connection to them she had never felt before.

She spent the long hours with a small, cheap notebook and a pen she’d bought at the bus terminal. She wasn’t trying to write songs. She was just writing. She wrote about the colour of the bitumen on a hot day, about the sound of a spoke being plucked, about the taste of salt on her skin after a long ride. She described the face of the boy band singer when the confetti fell, the weary kindness in Marcus’s eyes, the way the whole of Cairns seemed to be held in Len’s oil-stained hands. The words came easily, without the pressure of melody or rhyme. She was simply mapping her own world, taking inventory of the pieces she had been given. By the time the bus pulled into her destination the next afternoon, she had filled half the notebook.

The town was smaller and quieter than she had imagined. The bus station was just a designated stop outside a sleepy-looking general store. The air was warm but dry, scented with salt from a sea she could hear but not yet see. There was a stillness to the place, a slow, sun-drenched pace that felt worlds away from the frantic energy of both Sydney and Cairns. Following the directions on her phone, she walked down a street lined with modest, sun-faded houses, their gardens overflowing with bougainvillea and hibiscus. It was a place where things grew, slowly and without fuss. It was a place someone might choose to heal.

And then she saw it. ‘Blooms by Jo’. It wasn't a slick, modern florist. It was a small, charming weatherboard shop painted a soft sea-green, with a wide, welcoming verandah. Buckets of native flowers—vibrant kangaroo paw, delicate waxflower, and fragrant eucalyptus—spilled out onto the pavement, a riot of life and colour. The name was hand-painted on a wooden sign that swung gently in the sea breeze. Cass stopped across the street, her heart beginning to hammer against her ribs. This was her mother’s world. A world built of beauty and patience, a world that had continued to grow while her own had been frozen in time. The fear she felt was a clean, sharp fear, not the murky dread of the unknown, but the acute terror of the known and the necessary. This was the final climb, steeper and more terrifying than the Gillies Range.

Taking a deep, shaky breath that tasted of salt and flowers, she crossed the street. The small bell above the door chimed as she pushed it open, the sound impossibly loud in the quiet afternoon. The air inside was cool and fragrant, a dense, sweet perfume of pollen and damp earth. And there, standing behind a rustic wooden counter, her back to the door, was a woman with familiar dark, curly hair, now threaded with silver. She was carefully wrapping a bunch of brilliant yellow sunflowers in brown paper, her movements deft and practiced. She hadn't heard the bell. Cass stood frozen just inside the doorway, her bag on the floor, her notebook clutched in her hand. For a moment, she couldn't breathe, couldn't speak. She was a ghost again, standing on the threshold of a life that wasn't hers. The woman finished tying the raffia bow on the sunflowers and turned, a gentle smile on her face as if expecting a customer. The smile froze. Her eyes—they were Cass’s eyes—widened. The bunch of sunflowers slipped from her fingers, landing with a soft, muffled thud on the counter. “Cassie?” her mother whispered, her voice catching on the name, a sound of disbelief and fragile, terrified hope.Cass could only manage a single, slow nod, a gesture that felt both inadequate and monumental. The tears she had held back for the entire bus journey, for the entire walk through the unfamiliar town, finally spilled over, hot and silent. The notebook in her hand suddenly felt impossibly heavy. In her mother’s shocked stillness, Cass saw the reflection of her own eight-year absence, a void given form. The dropped sunflowers on the counter, a splash of brilliant, abandoned yellow, seemed to absorb all the light in the room, a small, perfect tragedy that encapsulated the much larger one between them.

Slowly, as if moving through deep water, Joanne came around the end of the counter. Her steps were hesitant, navigating the familiar geography of her shop as if the floor had become unstable beneath her feet. She didn't rush. The years had taught her caution. She stopped a foot away from Cass, her hands hovering in the air between them, unsure where to land. Then, with a soft, shuddering sigh that seemed to release the breath she had been holding since 2014, she closed the final distance. The embrace was awkward, fragile. Cass felt the unfamiliar sharpness of her mother’s collarbones, the soft cotton of her shirt that smelled of crushed leaves, damp earth, and a faint, floral perfume. She was holding a stranger who knew all of her secrets. She clung to her, burying her face in her mother’s shoulder, the tears now coming in great, silent, wracking sobs, a grief too old for sound.

Joanne held her, her hand stroking Cass’s hair with a tentative, rediscovered rhythm. After a long time, the embrace loosened, but they didn’t fully let go. Joanne framed Cass’s face with her hands, her thumbs wiping away the tears. Her own eyes were swimming. "You’re here," she said, the two words a statement of fact that carried a universe of disbelief, relief, and pain. "You really came." Cass, her throat raw and constricted, could only nod again, the simple movement a profound affirmation. Joanne’s gaze dropped to the object Cass was clutching so tightly, the small, cheap notebook. "What's this?" she asked, her voice soft, a question about a small detail in the face of an overwhelming whole.

"It's… just," Cass started, her voice a raw croak. She cleared her throat. "It's for the songs." The admission, the first time she had spoken of her music to her mother in years, felt like another wall crumbling. A look of deep, complex understanding passed over Joanne’s face. She glanced towards the front window, at the quiet street outside, as if suddenly remembering the rest of the world existed. With a new resolve, she gently let go of Cass, walked to the door, and with a decisive click, turned the lock and flipped the hand-painted sign from ‘Open’ to ‘Closed’. The small act felt momentous, a deliberate drawing of a boundary around this reunion. The world, with its customers and its curiosity, could wait. "Come on," she said, her voice stronger now. "Come in the back. I’ll put the kettle on."

The space behind the beaded curtain was not a stockroom, but a life. A small, cozy living area had been carved out of the back of the shop, with a worn but comfortable armchair, a tiny kitchenette, and shelves crowded with books and photographs. It was here that Cass saw it: a framed picture on the main shelf of a fifteen-year-old girl with dark, defiant eyes and a guitar slung over her shoulder. It was her, from before. The girl who had won the silver statuette, the girl who had screamed in the car. Seeing her there, frozen in time, loved and preserved on her mother’s shelf, sent another wave of grief and gratitude through her. Her mother had never thrown her away.

Joanne busied herself with the ritual of making tea, the clink of mugs and the hiss of the gas stove a comforting, normal sound in the emotionally charged air. She placed a steaming mug in front of Cass at a small, round table. For a moment, they just sat, the steam rising between them like a fragile veil. Then Cass put her notebook on the table and folded her hands on top of it. "Mum," she began, and this time her voice was steady. "I'm so sorry." The words, once spoken, came in a flood. She apologised not just for the crash, but for the selfish, blinding ambition, for the cruel words that had been their last conversation, for the eight years of silence that her amnesia had created but that her fear had maintained. She talked until she was empty, until all the guilt and shame she had carried had been laid bare on the small kitchen table between them.

Joanne listened without interruption, her expression a landscape of sorrow and compassion. When Cass finally fell silent, exhausted, Joanne reached across and covered Cass’s hands with her own. "Oh, Cassie," she said softly. "I was so scared. Not of your ambition, but for you. You were like a star burning too brightly, and I was terrified you would burn out completely." She squeezed Cass’s hands. "I was hurt in the crash, yes, but the real injury was losing you. First to the music, and then… to the quiet. I tried, in the beginning, to talk about it, to bring it back. But you would get those terrible headaches, you would just… shut down. The doctors said not to push. So I stopped. I left you the trophy, the cheap one, hoping one day it might be a clue. And then I just… waited. I built a life out of quiet, growing things because I didn't know what else to do."

They sat like that for a long time, hands clasped across the table, the tea in their mugs growing cold. The afternoon sun slanted through the back window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. The chasm that had separated them for so long was finally being filled, not with forgetting, but with understanding. With a sense of lightness she hadn't felt in her entire life, Cass found herself telling her mother about Marcus, about the small, honest record label, about the open-ended offer. It wasn’t a dilemma anymore; it was just the next chapter. A genuine, unburdened smile lit up Joanne’s face. "It sounds," she said, her voice full of a gentle, rediscovered pride, "like a place where things can grow." Outside, the sun began to set, painting the sky in soft shades of pink and orange. The journey home was over. And in the quiet, fragrant air of her mother’s kitchen, Cass Daley finally felt ready for the journey out.**Chapter 8**

The next morning, Cass woke to a world painted in soft light and scented with the sweet, green perfume of living things. For a dizzying moment, she thought she was dreaming, the unfamiliar quiet a stark contrast to the rhythmic, sloshing thunder of the laundromat that had been the soundtrack to her life for years. Light, filtered through the leaves of a sprawling ficus tree outside the back window, dappled the walls. From the front of the shop, she could hear the gentle snip of shears and the rustle of paper. She found her mother in the cool morning air of the shop, already at work, her hands, so like Cass’s own, moving with a fluid, unconscious grace as she selected blooms from a bucket of water. Joanne looked up and smiled, a real, easy smile that reached her eyes, and the last of the morning’s disorientation vanished, replaced by a feeling so new and fragile Cass didn’t dare put a name to it. It felt something like peace.

“There’s tea on the stove,” Joanne said. “And I saved you the last of the mangoes.” The offering was simple, domestic, and more profound than any grand gesture. After breakfast, Cass found herself hovering awkwardly at the entrance to the shop, feeling like a guest who had overstayed their welcome. She watched as her mother deftly wired a delicate spray of baby’s breath. “I can help,” Cass heard herself say, the words a surprise even to her. She had spent her life powering through things, on the bike, in the café, but the quiet, patient world of the flower shop was a foreign country. Joanne looked at her, a flicker of the old, pained caution in her eyes, before it was replaced by a gentle warmth. “Alright,” she said, and handed Cass a bunch of roses and a small, sharp knife. “Start by stripping the lower leaves and thorns. Gently. You don’t want to bruise the stem.”

Cass spent the morning learning the quiet language of her mother’s life. It was a language spoken in the texture of leaves, the precise angle to cut a stem, the subtle difference between a flower that would last a week and one that would wilt by nightfall. Her hands, calloused from handlebars and accustomed to the blunt mechanics of a bike chain, slowly learned a new, more delicate kind of work. It was meditative, demanding a presence of mind that left no room for ghosts or anxieties. While they worked side-by-side, a silent space opened up between them, and into it, they began to place the small, ordinary details of their missing years. Joanne spoke of learning the trade, of the customers who had become friends, of the quiet satisfaction in seeing a wedding bouquet come together. Cass, in turn, spoke of Len, of the comforting grease and logic of his workshop, and of the long, lonely rides that had, unknowingly, been her therapy. They were not talking about the accident or the amnesia; they were rebuilding the bridge between them, one small, sturdy plank at a time.

In the quiet of the afternoon, while a customer hummed over the selection of potted herbs, Joanne noticed the notebook sitting on the kitchen table. “That’s the first time I’ve seen you with one of those in a long time,” she said, her voice carefully neutral. Cass’s first instinct was to close it, to hide it away. The book felt too new, the thoughts inside too raw. But looking at her mother, who was now calmly misting a fern, her face serene, Cass realised the fear was gone. The music was no longer a weapon or a wound. It was just… hers. “I’m just… writing things down,” she said. “Not songs, really. Just… thoughts.” Joanne turned from the fern, her eyes soft with an emotion Cass couldn't quite read. “That’s how it always started, don’t you remember?” she said. “With the thoughts. The songs came after.” It was a statement of fact, a simple observation, but for Cass, it was a profound absolution. It was the permission she hadn't known she was waiting for.

That evening, sitting in the worn armchair while her mother did the books, Cass took out her phone. Her fingers felt steady as she dialled. First, she called Len. She told him where she was, about her mother, about the flower shop. His gruff voice on the other end was thick with relief. “Told you it was a journey home, kid,” he said. “That’s good. That’s right.” She then told him about Marcus’s offer, the real one, the quiet one. There was a long pause on the line. “Well, I’ll be,” he said finally, a genuine chuckle rumbling in his chest. “Looks like The Pelican Fund might need to pay for a plane ticket instead of another bus.” Then, with a deep breath, she called Marcus. When he answered, she didn’t stammer or hesitate. “It’s Cass Daley,” she said, her voice clear and calm. “I’d like to come and talk about the songs. I have some new ideas.”

Her departure, two days later, was the antithesis of every other time she had left somewhere. There was no running, no sense of escape. Joanne drove her to the small regional airport in her old, flower-scented station wagon. The silence in the car was comfortable, filled with the presence of things repaired rather than the absence of things broken. At the departures gate, a tiny, one-room affair, Joanne didn’t offer a torrent of advice or last-minute warnings. Instead, she pressed a small, laminated bookmark into Cass’s hand. Inside, a single, perfectly pressed frangipani blossom was preserved against a white background. It was the flower whose scent had hung in the air of her childhood, the scent of a Cairns night. “So you remember the smell of home,” Joanne said, her voice steady. “The real one.” The hug that followed was not the fragile, awkward embrace of their reunion, but a strong, sure hug, a sending-off.

As the small propeller plane climbed, banking over the coast, Cass could see the turquoise water, the white line of the surf, and the green smudge of the town where her mother lived and worked. She held the bookmark in one hand and her open notebook in the other. She wasn’t looking back at what she had lost, but ahead, to what she was building. On the clean, empty page, she wrote a single line, the start of something new. It wasn’t a song about being broken, or a song about being found. It was a song about the quiet, steady, patient work of learning to grow again. The journey out had finally, truly, begun.The small plane, no bigger than one of the city buses Cass was used to, banked sharply over the glittering expanse of Sydney Harbour, the Opera House a familiar, distant pearl below. This time, the sight didn’t fill her with alienation or dread. It was just a building, a beautiful and complex structure where she had done a difficult but necessary thing. It was a landmark on a map that was rapidly expanding, a map that now included her mother’s flower shop and the quiet, sunlit street where it stood.

The studio Marcus had told her about was tucked down a laneway in an inner-city suburb, a place that felt a million miles from the corporate gloss of the television world. There was no gleaming reception desk, no assistants with headsets. The door, a heavy slab of recycled timber, was opened by a man with a wild beard and a t-shirt for a band Cass had never heard of. This was Julian, the label owner, the friend Marcus had mentioned. He didn’t shake her hand; he just nodded, his eyes kind and deeply intelligent, and said, “Marcus said you had songs. Come on in. Kettle’s just boiled.”

The studio was exactly as Marcus had described: more like a living room than a laboratory. The walls were lined with overflowing bookshelves and vintage guitars, their wood glowing under the warm light of mismatched lamps. A large, beautiful Persian rug covered most of the floor, and in the centre of it all, instead of a sterile mixing desk, sat a comfortable, slightly sagging leather sofa. The recording equipment was there, but it felt like part of the furniture, integrated and unassuming. A huge, multi-tracked tape machine stood in one corner like an ancient, slumbering deity. This wasn't a place designed for hit-making; it was a place designed for listening.

For the first day, no one asked her to sing. Julian made tea, Marcus dropped by, and they just talked. They talked about music, not as a product, but as a language. Julian asked her about the Gillies Range, about the feel of a steel-frame bike, about the rhythm of the laundromat. He wasn't mining her for her "story"; he was trying to understand her world, the place her music came from. He spoke about the artists he worked with, not in terms of sales, but in terms of the records they had made, the sounds they had chased. It was a conversation so devoid of ambition and commerce that Cass felt the last of her stage-show armour fall away.

On the second day, Julian gestured to one of the guitars hanging on the wall. "Feel like playing?" he asked, as casually as if he were offering her a biscuit. It was a beautiful, small-bodied acoustic, its wood aged to the colour of dark honey. Her fingers, which now felt as comfortable stripping thorns as they did gripping handlebars, closed around the smooth, worn neck. It felt like a homecoming. She didn't play 'All The King's Horses'. She didn't play anything she had ever thought of as a song. She just played. She found a simple, open-tuned chord and let it ring out in the quiet, wood-panelled room. And then, she started to hum the melody that had come to her on the bike ride in Cairns, the one that wasn't sad or happy, just a quiet harmony with the whirring of the wheels.

She started to put words to it, the words she had been writing in her notebook on the bus. She sang about the light on the water at dawn, about the smell of hot bitumen, about the honest ache in her thighs after a long climb. It wasn't a song about pain or loss; it was a song about the texture of being alive, about the small, concrete realities that had saved her. When she finished, the room was silent. Julian was leaning forward on the sofa, his eyes closed, listening not just with his ears but with his whole body. Marcus was smiling, a look of deep satisfaction on his face. “That’s a good start,” Julian said, his voice a low rumble. “What else have you got?”

The week unfolded like a conversation. Cass would play the fragile beginnings of an idea, a verse, a chorus, a single line. Julian and Marcus would listen, ask questions, suggest a different chord, a minor shift in rhythm. They weren't producing her; they were midwifing the songs. They recorded everything onto the big tape machine, the hiss of the analogue tape a warm, forgiving presence in the room. There were no click tracks, no digital tuning. They captured the imperfections, the sound of a finger sliding on a string, the slight catch in Cass’s voice, the audible breath before a line. They were recording not just the song, but the moment the song was being discovered.

One afternoon, Julian asked about the other trophy, the silver statuette. "So you won a songwriting award when you were fifteen?" Cass nodded, a faint flush of the old shame returning. "What was the B-side?" he asked. Cass looked at him, confused. "The B-side," he repeated. "Back in the day, a single was a promise. You had the A-side, the one you sent to radio. But the B-side, that's where you put the weird stuff. The track you loved but didn't think anyone would get. The real heart of the record. 'All The King's Horses' was your A-side. What was your B-side?" The question unlocked a door she hadn't even known was there. She remembered a quiet, finger-picked song she had written in her bedroom late one night, a song that had felt too small, too personal, too strange for the competition. It was a song about the impossible green of the rainforest after a storm, about the ghosts of the old miners on the Gillies Range, a song filled with the myths and the humidity of Far North Queensland. She had never played it for anyone.

She picked up the guitar and, hesitantly at first, then with a growing confidence, she played it for them. It was a strange, haunting, beautiful song, full of odd tunings and unexpected melodic turns. It sounded like home. When she finished, Julian was beaming. “That,” he said, pointing a finger at her, “is the first track on the album.”

At the end of the week, Cass sat on the sagging leather sofa, listening back to the rough demos they had made. It was her voice, her guitar, her words, but they sounded more real, more fully realised than she had ever imagined. It was the sound of a story being told, not for an audience of millions, but for an audience of one. The sound of a woman who had finally learned to sing in her own voice. "So," Julian said, switching off the tape machine. "What do you think? Feel like making a record?" Cass looked around the room, at the worn rug, the overflowing bookshelves, the slumbering tape machine. It felt more like home than any place she had ever been, except for a greasy bike shed and a small, fragrant flower shop. "Yes," she said, and the single word was not a hope or a dream, but a simple, solid statement of fact. "Yes, I do." The work was just beginning.The air in the laneway was cool and smelled of damp brick and diesel fumes from the main road, a stark contrast to the warm, wood-scented cocoon of the studio. As the heavy timber door clicked shut behind her, Cass felt the city rush back in, a cacophony of sirens, traffic, and a thousand overlapping conversations. For a moment, she felt untethered again, the week of creative sanctuary feeling like an impossibly fragile dream. But when she looked down at the notebook in her hands, its pages now filled with a spidery scrawl of lyrics, chord progressions, and Julian’s cryptic notes, she knew it was real. She had an agreement. She had work to do. And she knew, with a clarity that was both exhilarating and terrifying, that she could not do it from here. The songs were not in this city of concrete and hurried strangers; they were in the damp heat, the red soil, and the relentless, grinding honesty of the place she called home.

The bus ride north was a journey of purpose. Cass no longer stared out the window as a passive observer of a world she didn't belong to. She watched the landscape change, the grey of the suburbs giving way to the rolling hills and then the long, straight, sun-bleached highways of rural Queensland, and she saw it all as material. She filled her notebook with observations, with overheard snippets of conversation from the seat behind her, with the rhythm of the wheels on the uneven tarmac. She wasn't just writing down thoughts anymore; she was collecting textures, sounds, and colours for the album. The journey was no longer a means to an end, but part of the creative process itself, a long, slow inhalation before the exhalation of the music.

Rusty’s Bike Shed was exactly as she had left it, a fortress of organised chaos against the encroaching humidity. Len was in his usual spot, wrestling with a stubborn bottom bracket, his face a mask of grease and concentration. He grunted a greeting without looking up. Cass leaned against the counter, the familiar smell of oil and old rubber a grounding force. She didn’t launch into a grand announcement. She just waited, letting the familiar rhythms of the workshop settle her. Finally, Len put his wrench down with a clatter and wiped his hands on his permanently filthy rag. "Alright," he said, squinting at her. "You’ve got that look again. Not the spooked one. The other one. The one that says you just figured somethin' out. Spit it out." She told him everything, from the dusty, welcoming studio to Julian's quiet wisdom, to the hiss of the analogue tape. She told him about the B-side song, and the offer to make a real record.

Len listened, his expression unreadable. When she finished, he was silent for a long moment. He picked up a stray ball bearing from the counter, rolling it between his thumb and forefinger. “So,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “You’re trading in the bike grease for showbiz glitter, are ya?” There was a teasing glint in his eye, but beneath it, Cass saw a flicker of genuine concern. “It’s not like that,” she said quietly. “It’s more like… this.” She gestured around the workshop. “It’s about building something that’s honest, from the ground up. It’s just… a different kind of frame.” The corner of Len’s mouth twitched into a smile. He understood the language of building things. “A whole album,” he said, shaking his head in quiet wonder. “The kid from Cairns. I’ll be. Does this mean I gotta start callin’ you a rockstar?” “Never,” Cass laughed, the sound easy and real. “Just means I need to quit my job.”

Walking into the café the next day felt like visiting a museum of her former life. The familiar hiss of the espresso machine, the scent of burnt sugar from a batch of muffins, the slightly stressed look on her manager’s face – it was all part of a world she had already left. She found her manager in the cramped back office, doing paperwork. When she told him she was leaving, he looked up, sighed, and then surprised her by breaking into a wide, tired grin. “About time,” he said. “We all saw you on the telly, Cass. You’re meant for more than slinging flat whites. Just do me a favour and don’t forget us when you’re famous.” He shook her hand, and the simple, formal act felt like a graduation. That evening, she packed up her small room above the laundromat. She carefully boxed her few paperbacks, folded her clothes, and paused as she unplugged the small lamp on her bedside table. For a moment, she listened to the rhythmic slosh-and-tumble from below, the sound that had been the constant, metronomic heartbeat of her quietest years. It no longer sounded like a taunt. It just sounded like a machine, doing its work.

With her few belongings stored in the back of Len’s workshop, she was officially untethered, but for the first time, it felt like freedom, not a frightening void. She took The Rusty Pelican and headed for the hills, the bike a familiar, beloved limb beneath her. The air was thick enough to drink, the bitumen soft on the roads. She carved through the traffic, a blur of spinning spokes, but she wasn’t running. The burn in her lungs was the same, the fire in her thighs was the same, but the purpose was different. She wasn’t trying to outrun a ghost; she was chasing down a melody. As she climbed the familiar, winding road into the range, a line surfaced in her mind, a perfect, simple description of the light filtering through the canopy. She pulled over at a lookout, the Coral Sea a vast expanse of blue and gold below. Propping The Pelican against the guardrail, she dug her notebook and a pen from her jersey pocket. Her hand, steady and sure, moved across the page, the graphite letters a stark, honest black against the white. She was a cyclist. She was a singer. But now, as she stood under the vast, hot sky of Far North Queensland, surrounded by the noise and silence of the rainforest, she knew, with every fibre of her being, that she was a songwriter. And she had work to do.The corner of Rusty’s Bike Shed that became her own was nestled between a towering metal rack of second-hand wheelsets and a greasy workbench permanently dedicated to the arcane art of hydraulic brake repair. Her world shrank to a small mattress on the concrete floor, a milk crate that served as a bedside table, and her guitar leaning against a stack of old tyres. The air was a permanent, layered perfume of industrial degreaser, vulcanised rubber, and the sharp, metallic scent of ground steel. In the mornings, she’d wake to the scent of Len’s brewing coffee cutting through it all, and add her own small, defiant note to the atmosphere: the faint, sweet fragrance of the frangipani blossom pressed in the bookmark from her mother, which she kept propped on the milk crate like a tiny, sacred icon. Her new life had a simple, powerful rhythm: ride, write, rest, repeat. The early mornings were for the bike, her silent commute to a cathedral of inspiration. She’d pedal out before dawn, chasing the sunrise along the coast or climbing into the cool, green darkness of the rainforest, her mind a blank canvas, waiting for the landscape to paint itself upon it.

Afternoons were for the music. While Len tinkered, ground, and swore at stubborn machinery, Cass would sit on an upturned bucket with her guitar and her notebook, translating the morning’s ride into sound. The workshop became an unwitting collaborator in her creative process. The steady, hypnotic whir of a wheel spinning in a truing stand became a drone beneath a new melody. The sudden, sharp clang of a dropped spanner would jolt her out of a stale chord progression and into a new, syncopated rhythm. Len’s work was the percussion, the ambient noise that grounded her music in the real, the tangible, the world of effort and grease and iron. She wasn’t writing in a sterile, soundproofed room; she was writing from within the belly of the beast, and the beast’s heartbeat was finding its way into her songs. It was a slow, painstaking process. For every line that felt true, she wrote ten that were dishonest clichés. For every melody that soared, another three crashed and burned.

There were days the frustration was a physical thing, a tightening in her chest that made it hard to breathe. One sweltering afternoon, she was wrestling with a song about the ride up the range, but every word she wrote felt like a cheap postcard. The majesty of the climb, the glorious agony of it, was being reduced to tired rhymes about pain and rain. In a fit of disgust, she stopped playing, her hand poised to slam against the guitar’s body. “Sounds like that gear’s stuck,” Len grunted from across the workshop, not even looking up from the hub he was servicing. “Either the chain’s stretched or you’re in the wrong cog for the gradient.” The words, simple and mechanical, cut through her rage. She looked down at her notebook. He was right. She was trying to force the song up the hill in too high a gear, using big, powerful, clichéd words. She needed to shift down, to find the smaller, more precise language. She erased the whole verse and started again, not with the soaring view from the top, but with the tiny, specific detail of a drop of sweat falling from her chin onto the rusty top tube of The Pelican. And suddenly, the song started to climb.

The connection to her mother was an anchor in the swirling, uncertain waters of the creative process. They spoke every Sunday, the conversations unburdened and easy. Cass would describe a new chord she’d found, or a line of a song that had arrived fully-formed on a morning ride. Joanne, in turn, would tell her about the delicate, stubborn seeds of a native orchid she was trying to germinate, or about a customer who had cried with joy over a wedding bouquet. They were both in the business of cultivating fragile, living things, and they found a deep, unspoken understanding in that shared work. One week, struggling to find the right words for a song about forgiveness, Cass found herself stuck. Joanne, sensing the block, didn't offer advice. Instead, she told a long, meandering story about a gnarled, seemingly dead bougainvillea she had inherited with the shop, how she’d almost ripped it out a dozen times, but had kept watering it out of sheer stubbornness, and how one morning, after years of nothing, it had exploded into a riot of impossible, magenta blooms. That night, Cass finished the song, its chorus not about a grand act of pardon, but about the slow, patient, thankless work of watering dead-looking things, just in case.

One evening, after Len had gone home and the workshop had fallen into a rare, profound silence broken only by the chirping of geckos on the tin roof, she found herself staring at the frangipani bookmark. She thought of the two journeys Len had spoken of: the one home, and the one out. She had taken the journey home, and it had healed her. Now, she was on the cusp of the journey out, a trip she was building herself, one song at a time. She picked up her guitar, her fingers finding a new, open tuning she had been experimenting with. A melody began to form under her hands, not a lament or a struggle, but a tune that felt like an open road, like the long, straight highway stretching into the heat-haze of the west. The lyrics that came were not about the past, but about the act of choosing a direction. It was a song of forward motion, acknowledging the weight of the baggage in the back seat but focusing on the view through the windscreen. It felt like a mission statement. It felt like the title track.

She now had a small collection of songs that felt like a family. They were raw, infused with the sounds of the workshop and the sweat of the road. There was the B-side song, the haunting, humid hymn to the rainforest. There was the song born of Len's advice, a gritty, percussive ode to the climb. There was the quiet, patient song about forgiveness, watered by her mother’s bougainvillea story. And now there was this new one, the song of the open road. Using the last of her savings from the Pelican Fund, she bought a cheap digital recorder and, over the course of a day, laid them all down, one after another. She recorded them right there in her corner of the workshop, the ambient sounds of Len’s work bleeding into the tracks. She sent the files to Julian with a short, simple email: ‘This is what I have so far.’

The call came three days later. It was Julian, and his voice was electric with an excitement that seemed to vibrate right through the phone. “Cass, these are incredible,” he said, his usual calm replaced by a torrent of enthusiasm. “The songs are breathing. They’re alive. And the background noise… the grinding, the clanking… I wouldn't erase a second of it. It’s part of the music. It’s the sound of the world they were born in.” He took a breath. “We have to get this on tape. All of it. The songs are ready, Cass. More than ready.” Cass stood in the middle of the workshop, phone pressed to her ear, the familiar smells of her sanctuary filling her lungs. She looked at the racks of wheels, the greasy tools, the battered frame of The Rusty Pelican leaning against the wall. This place had been her incubator, her refuge. Now, it was time to take what she had built here and give it a voice the whole world could hear. “It’s time,” Julian’s voice crackled on the line. “Pack your guitar. We’re ready to make a record.”The finality of Julian’s words—“Pack your guitar. We’re ready to make a record”—did not land like a thunderclap, but like the quiet, satisfying click of a perfectly indexed gear shifting into place. Cass stood in the centre of the workshop, the phone still warm against her ear, and looked at the world that had become her sanctuary. The racks of wheels were no longer just clutter; they were a forest of circular possibility. The greasy tools were not just implements of repair; they were instruments of creation. This space, which had sheltered her, had done its job. It had incubated a new version of herself, one strong enough to leave. She ended the call and walked over to where Len was meticulously re-greasing a set of bearings, his gnarled fingers working with the delicate precision of a surgeon. She didn't have to say a word. He knew from the stillness in her posture, from the quiet light in her eyes.

He finished his task, carefully wiping the excess grease from the hub shell before looking up at her. “So,” he grunted, his voice a low rumble. “The journey out, is it?” Cass nodded, a slow smile spreading across her face. “It’s time to make the record.” Len let out a long breath, a sound that was part sigh, part proud chuckle. He surveyed his kingdom of iron and rubber, his gaze finally landing on The Rusty Pelican. “Well, you can’t take that with you on the plane,” he said, a statement of fact that held a deeper meaning. The bike had been her vehicle for escape, for therapy, for inspiration. It had carried her this far. But this next part of the journey required a different kind of transport. He walked over to a battered metal toolbox, the one that held his oldest, most trusted tools, and rummaged inside. He returned not with a tool, but with a small, worn leather pouch, the kind used for carrying a puncture repair kit. He pressed it into her hand. “You take this,” he said gruffly. “Just in case you get a flat. Metaphorically speakin’.” Inside, there was no patch kit. There was only a single, perfectly trued, custom-cut spoke, its threaded end gleaming. It was a strange, nonsensical talisman, and to Cass, it was the most profound blessing she could imagine. It was a reminder of balance, of tension, and of the strength found in perfectly calibrated parts.

Her last ride was a pilgrimage. She set out in the pre-dawn dark, The Pelican’s single beam cutting a familiar path through the sleeping streets. She didn’t push for speed or climb for a personal best. Instead, she rode slowly, deliberately, retracing the routes that had become her lifeline. She pedalled along the Esplanade, watching the first light spill over the mudflats, turning the water from grey to silver to a brilliant, liquid gold. She rode to the base of the Gillies Range and just stood there for a moment, looking up at the winding ribbon of road, a silent thank you to the mountain that had taught her so much about endurance. She visited the city library, not to use the Wi-Fi, but to stand on the steps where her life had irrevocably changed, the memory of the frantic, clicking cleats now a distant, fond echo. It was a farewell tour not of a place, but of a past self. As the sun climbed higher, bathing the city in its thick, wet heat, she turned The Pelican back towards the workshop one last time, the journey complete.

The flight to Sydney was a study in contrasts. Gone was the anxious, haunted girl who had huddled in the cramped cabin of a train. This Cass watched the coastline shrink below, not with a sense of loss, but with a quiet, focused anticipation. She held her guitar case on her lap, a tangible extension of her purpose, and in her pocket, her fingers found the cool, reassuringly solid shape of the single spoke from Len. She was not a contestant heading to a competition. She was not a runaway escaping her past. She was a musician on her way to work, carrying her tools with her. The city that greeted her was the same sprawling, intimidating beast, but her relationship to it had been fundamentally altered. It was no longer a place of judgment; it was a place of creation. When she pushed open the heavy timber door to the studio, the familiar scent of old wood, warm electronics, and Julian’s strong tea felt like a genuine homecoming.

They spent no time on pleasantries. The atmosphere was one of quiet, shared purpose. Julian had the studio ready, the big tape machine cleaned and calibrated, its reels waiting like blank pages. A series of vintage microphones stood like strange, metallic sculptures in the main room, each one chosen for a specific quality, a specific warmth. Marcus was there, his presence a calming, grounding force. “Right,” Julian said, rubbing his hands together with a childlike glee. “The B-side. Let’s start with the one that sounds like the rainforest.” They worked to capture a sound that was both intimate and vast. Julian placed a microphone close to the guitar’s soundhole, another a few feet away to capture the resonance of the room, and a third, high in the corner, just to pick up the ambient space. “Sing it like you’re telling a secret to the whole world,” he instructed.

Cass took her place on a simple wooden stool, the beautiful old acoustic feeling like a part of her own body. She closed her eyes, not to block out the room, but to summon the memory of the Daintree after a storm: the smell of the wet earth, the impossible, dripping green, the deep, resonant quiet. She took a breath and began to play, the strange, haunting melody filling the studio. The first take was hesitant, technically clean but emotionally cautious. She was performing it, not inhabiting it. “Again,” Julian said simply through the headphones. The second take was better, but she could feel herself pushing, trying to impress, her voice straining for a perfection that the song didn't need. “Stop,” Marcus’s voice crackled in her ears. He came into the room and stood in front of her. “Len called me,” he said. “He told me to tell you, if you get a flat, you’re probably in the wrong gear.” The message, so absurd and so specific, was a key. It cut through the pressure, the self-consciousness, the fear of not being good enough. She let out a laugh, a real, unburdened sound that echoed in the quiet room. She looked down at the guitar, then back at the microphone. She wasn't here to be perfect. She was here to be honest.

She took a breath and started again. This time, she didn't try to sing. She just told the story. Her voice found the quiet, folkloric centre of the song, the notes imbued with humidity and shadow. Her fingers moved on the fretboard not with precision, but with feeling, letting a string buzz here, letting a chord hang a fraction too long there. She wasn't just singing about the rainforest; for three and a half minutes, she brought the rainforest into the room. When the final note faded into the warm hiss of the tape, the silence that followed was thick with a kind of magic. No one spoke. After a moment, Julian’s voice, hushed and reverent, came through the headphones. “Okay,” he said. “Let’s have a listen.” He rewound the heavy reels and hit play. The sound that filled the room was a revelation. It was her voice, her guitar, her song, but it was amplified, clarified, given a depth and a presence she had never imagined. And underneath it all, a faint, almost subliminal sound could be heard: the sound of her own quiet, joyful laugh, captured by the room mic just before the take began. It was the sound of her, finally, getting out of her own way.The successful recording of the rainforest song acted as a key, unlocking a new level of trust and creative intimacy in the studio. The initial, fragile tentativeness was replaced by a shared, focused energy, the quiet hum of three people engaged in work they believed in. They moved next to the song born from the climb up the Gillies Range, a song Cass had wrestled with in the workshop. Julian, listening to the rough demo Cass had recorded, was fascinated by the background sounds of Len's work. Instead of trying to clean up the demo, he wanted to lean into its mechanical heart. His eyes lit up with a feverish, inventive glee. The pristine studio was summarily invaded by the ghosts of Rusty’s Bike Shed. Julian sent a runner out with a hundred dollars and a strange shopping list, and he returned with a collection of dented bike rims, a tangled mess of old chains, and a box of loose sprockets and bearings.

They spent an entire afternoon not recording music, but building an orchestra of junk. Julian hung a cracked rim from a microphone stand and struck it with a mallet, producing a dull, resonant clang like a distant temple bell. Marcus, with surprising rhythmic dexterity, discovered that dragging a length of bike chain across the ridged surface of a pedal created a perfect, gritty shuffle. Cass, laughing, dropped a handful of ball bearings onto the head of a snare drum, the sound a chaotic, metallic spray that was the perfect sonic equivalent of gravel skittering under a tyre. They layered these sounds onto the tape, building a percussive bed that was not a rhythm track, but a soundscape of effort. When Cass finally laid her raw, driving guitar part and her tense, breathless vocal over it, the song was no longer just about a climb; it was the climb itself, a testament to muscle, will, and the beautiful, grinding friction of moving forward.

The days fell into a pattern of deep, immersive work. For the song of forgiveness, inspired by her mother’s bougainvillea story, Julian stripped everything away. He had Cass sing it late at night, the city outside quiet, her voice a near-whisper into a single, warm ribbon microphone. He brought in a cellist, a quiet woman with sad eyes who didn’t look at the sheet music, but instead closed her eyes and listened to Cass sing the song through once. Then, she simply played along, her cello part a deep, compassionate voice in conversation with Cass’s vocal, a sound of patient, unwavering support. There were no tricks, no overdubs, just the sound of two people listening to each other in a quiet room, the space between the notes as important as the notes themselves.

The process was not without its friction. The wall she hit came, ironically, with the simplest song, a quiet, three-chord tune about her small room above the laundromat. She wanted to capture the feeling of watching the dust motes dance in a sunbeam, the sound of the world happening somewhere else. But every time she tried to sing it, her voice came out tight, strained, tinged with a self-pity she no longer felt. The more she tried to force the gentle nostalgia, the more false it sounded. After the fifth failed take, the frustration in the room was a palpable thing. The cozy studio suddenly felt claustrophobic, the vintage microphones like silent, judging accusers. Julian, sensing her spiral, called a break. "The song's not going anywhere," he said gently. "Let's get some air."

Cass found herself pacing in the cool, damp air of the laneway, the old anxieties a familiar, venomous whisper in her ear. She was a fraud. She had one good story to tell, and now that it was told, she had nothing left. She was the girl with the rusty bike and the one sad song, and she was kidding herself thinking she could build a whole world out of it. Her hand went into her pocket, her fingers closing around the cold, hard reality of the single bike spoke Len had given her. She rolled it between her thumb and forefinger, the sharp, threaded end a familiar, grounding texture. *Balance. Tension. Strength.* The spoke was not a magic charm; it was a reminder of a principle. A wheel goes out of true when one spoke is too tight, pulling everything else out of alignment. She was tightening this song, pulling on it with the force of her own expectation, and it was warping the whole structure. She pulled out the frangipani bookmark her mother had given her. She looked at the perfectly preserved, delicate flower, a fragile thing that had once been alive, now captured in a moment of beauty. The song wasn’t about the misery of the room; it was about the unexpected, fragile beauty she had found there, the way the light had looked, the simple peace of being alone. She was trying to sing the memory of the cage, not the memory of the light that had come through its bars.

When she walked back into the studio, she went not to the vocal booth, but to the old, slightly out-of-tune upright piano in the corner. She sat down and, without a word, began to play the song, her fingers finding a simple, almost childlike arrangement. She sang it quietly, to herself, her voice unadorned, not trying to project or perform. She was just telling the story of the light. Julian, from the control room, silently hit record, capturing the take through the ambient room microphones. It was flawed, the piano was imperfect, her voice cracked once, but it was breathtakingly, devastatingly honest. It was the truth.

With that final wall broken, the path to the end of the album was clear. The last song they recorded was the title track, the song of the open road she had written in her corner of the workshop. This session felt different. It was not a quiet confession or a gritty re-enactment. It was a celebration. Julian brought in a drummer who played with swinging, joyful energy, and a bass player who locked into a groove that felt like a long, steady highway. The song was about forward motion, and for the first time, Cass felt herself truly looking ahead, not over her shoulder. Her vocal take was a single, joyous burst of energy, her voice soaring with a confidence she had earned, full of the dust of the road and the promise of the horizon.

On the final evening, the three of them gathered on the sagging leather sofa. The reels of two-inch tape, now filled with her voice, her story, her life, were spooled and marked in a neat row. Julian threaded the master reel onto the machine, the culmination of weeks of work, of years of silence. He dimmed the lights, hit play, and the album began. From the haunting, folkloric opening of the B-side song to the percussive, grinding climb, through the quiet, patient plea for forgiveness and the dusty, sunlit nostalgia of the laundromat room, to the final, soaring chords of the open road, the songs flowed into one another, a complete, coherent narrative. It was the sound of a life, with all its cracks and rust and unexpected beauty, transmuted into art. As the last note faded into the warm tape hiss, no one spoke. There was nothing to say. Cass looked at the spinning, empty reel, then at the faces of the two men who had helped her navigate the journey. She was no longer just the girl on the bike, or the girl from the TV show. She was an artist. And this was her record.
