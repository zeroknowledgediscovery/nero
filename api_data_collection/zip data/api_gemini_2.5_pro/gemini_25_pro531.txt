The call found her elbows-deep in lukewarm water, wrestling with a blocked u-bend. A typical Tuesday. The gurgle from the sink had been a miserable counterpoint to the drone of the daytime quiz show for an hour before she’d finally surrendered, pulled on the marigolds, and knelt before the porcelain god of domestic failure. Her phone, vibrating violently on the draining board, sounded like a trapped wasp. She grunted, snagging a tea towel to dry her hands, leaving a smear of something unspeakable on the cotton.

“Sloan.”

The voice on the other end was young, taut with a nervous energy she recognised as belonging to DC Miller. “Ma’am. We’ve got one. By the canal. Shelton New Road.”

She didn’t need to ask what kind of ‘one’. Miller wouldn't have called her for a pub brawl or a stolen Cortina. His voice had the high, thin timbre of fresh horror. “On my way.”

The u-bend would have to wait. The whole sorry mess of her life, neatly contained within the four walls of this terraced house in Penkhull, would have to wait. She peeled off the rubber gloves, the powder inside making her skin feel clammy and dead. Ten minutes later, she was in her car, the familiar scent of stale coffee and damp upholstery a comfort of sorts. Stoke-on-Trent unfolded around her, a city of muted colours even on a good day. Today was not a good day. A low, bruised sky pressed down on the ranks of terraced houses, their brickwork stained dark with a century of coal dust and rain. The skeletal forms of bottle kilns, the city’s silent, conical ghosts, punctuated the skyline. There was a particular kind of grey to Stoke, a colour born of clay and cloud, and as she drove, a cold knot tightened in her stomach. A premonition, ugly and sharp.

The blue and white tape was already a garish slash against the towpath’s scrubby green and the canal’s oily black water. Uniforms stood in tight, quiet clusters, their breath pluming in the chill air. A forensics van was parked clumsily on the grass verge, its doors agape. She badged the first constable, a kid whose face was the colour of putty, and ducked under the tape.

“DI Sloan,” she said, her voice flatter than she intended. “Talk to me.”

The kid swallowed. “Dog walker found him, ma’am. About an hour ago. Just… there.” He pointed a gloved thumb towards a small copse of silver birch trees that grew between the path and the back of an old ceramics factory.

Miller was waiting for her at the edge of the trees, his lanky frame looking awkward and out of place. He was a good lad, bright, but he still wore the shock of the job on his face like a new suit. “Ma’am. It’s… you need to see it.”

She nodded, pulling on her own gloves, the snap of the latex a small, sharp report in the quiet. “Anything else?”

“No signs of a struggle on the path. No drag marks we can see. Forensics are just starting. It’s like he was placed there.”

She followed him in. The ground was soft, mulchy with dead leaves. The air smelled of damp earth, canal water, and something else. Something chemical and acrid, like primer. And there he was.

He was a boy. Couldn't be more than sixteen, seventeen at a push. He was propped against the trunk of the largest birch, his posture almost casual, as if he’d sat down for a rest and simply never got up. He wore jeans and a hoodie, the kind of anonymous uniform you saw on every high street. But that wasn’t what made Miller’s voice tremble. That wasn’t what made the bile rise in Sloan’s throat.

The boy was grey.

Not pale, not ashen. He was coated, head to foot, in a thick, matte, uniform layer of grey. It clogged his hair, turning it into a solid, sculpted helmet. It covered his face, his clothes, the visible skin of his hands and neck. It was the colour of undercoat, of battleship hulls, of the sky that hung over them like a shroud. He looked less like a body and more like a statue. A grotesque piece of public art left to rot.

Sloan crouched, her knees cracking in protest. She forced herself to look, to be a police officer, to see the details past the overwhelming, monolithic horror of the grey. The paint—or whatever it was—was flawless. No drips, no brush strokes she could discern. It was a complete and deliberate erasure of identity. He wasn't a boy anymore. He was an object. An effigy.

“Jesus Christ,” Miller whispered, his voice cracking. “Who does this?”

Sloan didn’t answer. She was looking at the boy’s face. The grey substance had filled the hollows of his eyes and the slight parting of his lips, sealing them. There was a strange peace to it, a terrible serenity. This wasn't the work of frenzied rage. This was cold. This was meticulous. This was… a statement.

“Heard of anything like this? Anywhere?” she asked, her eyes still fixed on the grey form.

“No, ma’am. Nothing. Checked the system on the way over. It’s… new.”

Of course it was new. You didn’t forget a signature like this. She remembered her first job after leaving social work, the transfer to the force. She'd wanted to stop things happening, to be the barrier rather than the person who picked up the pieces after. She’d been a caretaker of broken children then, patching them up, finding them new homes, new lives. Now she was a caretaker of the dead, trying to piece together the final, broken moments of their lives. The futility of it hit her sometimes, a physical blow. It hit her now, looking at this grey boy-statue under a grey sky.

“What about ID?”

“Nothing on him,” Miller said. “Pockets are empty. No phone, no wallet. The dog walker didn’t see his face, just the… the colour. Phoned it in straight away.”

Empty pockets. That snagged her attention, pulling her back from the edge of despair. It could be a simple robbery. A mugging gone too far. But it didn't feel right. Theatricality like this didn't usually walk hand-in-hand with petty theft. She looked closer at the boy’s right wrist. There was a pale band on the grey-caked skin, a sliver of flesh where a watch or a bracelet must have been. The killer hadn't just taken his wallet and phone. He’d taken his watch. A trophy? Or something more?

Greed. The thought surfaced, unbidden. It was an old, simple, ugly motive. But to pair it with such a bizarre, ritualistic display? It was a discordant note.

“Get the SOCOs to focus on that wrist,” she said, pointing with her chin. “And the composition of this… stuff. I want to know exactly what it is. Is it paint? Is it something else? Get it to the lab. Top priority.”

“Ma’am.”

She stood up, her joints aching. She looked away from the body, out through the trees, past the canal to the factory beyond. Its windows were smashed, its brickwork crumbling. It was a monument to a dead industry, a place where men had once turned grey clay into things of beauty and function. Now it was just a husk. A bit like the boy at her feet. Turned from a person into a thing. The thought sent a fresh shiver down her spine, one that had nothing to do with the cold. This killer, whoever he was, he knew this city. He knew its colours. He was using its very soul as his palette. And this, she knew with a certainty that settled in her bones like the damp, was only the beginning.Dr Adebayo arrived, his bulky frame wrapped in a tweed overcoat that seemed incongruous with the grim task at hand. His face, usually set in an expression of genial cynicism, was sombre. He gave Sloan a brief, tight nod, his gaze already on the body. He was the city’s pathologist, a man who spoke for the dead, and Sloan valued his lack of sentimentality more than he could know. He crouched beside the boy, his movements surprisingly deft for a man his size, his breath held. For a long minute, the only sounds were the whisper of the wind in the birch leaves and the distant hum of traffic on the A500.

“It’s not paint,” he said finally, his voice a low rumble. He’d touched a gloved finger to the boy’s cheek, studying the substance that came away. “The texture is wrong. It’s too fine, too uniform. It’s more like a slip. Liquid clay. Or perhaps a high-build industrial primer. Dries fast, covers everything.” He looked up at Sloan, his dark eyes holding hers. “He wasn’t killed here, DI Sloan. Not like this.”

Sloan had suspected as much. “How can you be sure?”

“Look at the ground,” Adebayo gestured with his chin at the carpet of leaves around the body. “If he’d been coated here, there would be overspray, spatter, pooling. Something. There’s nothing. The scene is clean, unnaturally so. He was brought here post-mortem, or at least very close to it, and after this… application.” Adebayo stood, brushing his gloved hands together in a gesture of finality. “As for cause of death, I won’t know for sure until I get this stuff off him and get him on my table. But my guess? Asphyxiation. The substance is sealing his mouth and nose. The question is whether that’s what killed him, or if it was just the killer’s finishing touch.”

The thought was sickening. To be suffocated slowly by a thick, cold, ceramic shroud. Miller came jogging back from the towpath, his face pale but set with purpose. He held up a clear evidence bag. Inside was a small, sodden scrap of paper. “Found it in the reeds, about twenty feet downstream, ma’am. Just caught on a branch. Might be nothing.”

Sloan took the bag. It was a corner torn from a page, maybe from a sketchbook. The paper was thick, high-quality. On it, in what looked like charcoal, was a drawing. It was a detailed sketch of a bottle kiln, but it was stylised, almost monstrous. The kiln’s mouth was drawn like a gaping maw, and from its chimney, a plume of smoke curled into the shape of a skeletal hand. It was skilfully drawn, but deeply unsettling. There was no signature, no other markings. It was just an image, a fragment of a nightmare bobbing in the black water.

“Could have come from anywhere,” Miller offered, though his tone suggested he didn't believe it.

“No,” Sloan said, her eyes fixed on the drawing. “This is his.” She held it up. The style, the subject matter, the darkness of it… it felt connected. The killer hadn’t just placed a body; he’d curated a scene. The grey boy-statue, the derelict factory, the canal, and now this. A calling card. She looked from the drawing in her hand to the silent factory across the water. Its shape was a dull echo of the one on the paper.

“Check local art colleges, night classes, anywhere that teaches life drawing or sketching,” she ordered Miller. “Show this around. Someone might recognise the style. And get a team to start a fingertip search of the entire towpath, both sides of the canal, from the bridge to the lock. I want anything that looks out of place.” She handed the bag back to him. “And get onto Missing Persons. A boy, late teens, probably from the local area. Tell them to look for anyone with an interest in art. It’s a long shot, but it’s all we have.”

She turned back to the copse. The forensics team were working with quiet efficiency now, erecting a tent around the body to preserve the scene from the fine drizzle that had begun to fall. The world was shrinking to this small, horrific patch of ground. Sloan felt a familiar weariness settle over her, heavy as a lead blanket. She’d left social work to build walls, but all she ever seemed to do was walk through the ruins. This killer wasn’t just committing murder; he was creating something. He was a craftsman, and the city itself was his workshop. He was turning people into objects, erasing them with the very substance that had once given Stoke-on-Trent its name. The grey boy was not just a victim. He was a message. And Sloan knew, with a certainty that chilled her more than the damp air, that she was the intended recipient.The drizzle thickened, clinging to her coat and beading on the brim of Miller’s cap. The garish blue and white of the police tape seemed to bleed in the wet, the only vibrant colour in a world rendered in shades of grey. Sloan took one last look at the scene: the white tent now fully obscuring the body, the methodical sweep of the forensics officers, the silent, hulking factory across the black water. It was a tableau of organised procedure imposed upon an act of profound and terrifying chaos. The killer had chosen his stage well, a place of decay and neglect, where a new horror could be born from the ashes of the old.

"I'm heading back to Hanley," she told Miller, her voice low. "Keep me updated. I want to know the second you get anything from the lab on that substance, or a whisper of a name from Missing Persons. And Miller," she added, stopping him as he turned to go, "watch yourself. Whoever did this is controlled, but there's a rage there. Cold rage. It's the worst kind."

He nodded, the shock on his face now replaced with a grim resolve she was glad to see. "Yes, ma'am."

The drive back to the central police station in Hanley was a journey through the city’s heart. Sloan barely noticed the traffic. Her mind was replaying the scene, trying to fit the pieces together. The grey boy. The missing watch. The theatrical placement. The drawing of the kiln. It felt less like a murder investigation and more like an exercise in art criticism. The killer was an artist, his medium was human life, and his gallery was the forgotten corners of Stoke-on-Trent. The thought made her skin crawl. She had dealt with brutality, with greed, with passion-fuelled violence. This was different. This was a performance, and the curtain had only just gone up.

The station was a hive of forced normality, the air thick with the smell of cheap coffee and bureaucracy. The news had already filtered through, and a quiet tension hummed beneath the surface of the daily routine. In the newly designated incident room, a whiteboard was already dominated by a map of the canal area. Phones were being installed, computers logged on. The machinery of a murder hunt was clanking into life. Her superintendent, Davies, a man whose career was built on managing press conferences and departmental budgets, was waiting for her.

“Sloan. In my office.” His tone was clipped. “The Chief Constable has been on the phone. A boy, found like that… the press are going to have a field day. We need to control the narrative.”

Sloan followed him into his glass-walled office, feeling a familiar wave of irritation. “The narrative, sir, is that a teenage boy has been murdered in a uniquely horrific way. My priority is finding who did it, not what headline the Sentinel runs with.”

“Your priority,” Davies said, leaning on his desk, his polished shoes reflecting the strip lighting, “is to manage this investigation without causing a city-wide panic. A ‘Grey Man’ murderer stalking the canals? It’s ghoul-fodder. I want this contained. I’m giving you the resources, but I want quick results. And keep the details of the… presentation… under wraps for as long as possible. We’ll brief the press that a body has been found and we’re treating it as suspicious. Nothing more.”

“With respect, sir, the ‘presentation’ is our only real lead. It’s a signature. We need the public’s help. Someone might have seen something, know something about this material.”

“And someone might copy it for a bloody Halloween prank,” Davies countered. “No. We do this by the book, quietly. No leaks. No speculation. Is that understood, DI Sloan?”

Sloan bit back a sharp retort. She understood perfectly. She was to solve an impossible murder, but without using the most significant, albeit terrifying, piece of information she had. “Understood, sir.”

She walked out of his office without another word, her jaw tight. The incident room felt smaller now, the pressure from above a tangible weight. She stood before the whiteboard, the map of Stoke a web of streets and waterways. It was a city she knew intimately, its arteries and its dark, forgotten veins. The killer knew them too. He was out there now, somewhere in this network of terraced houses and post-industrial wasteland, his work for the day done. She picked up a dry-wipe marker and, in the corner of the board, drew a rough sketch of a bottle kiln with a plume of smoke curling from its top. It looked crude and childish next to the memory of the drawing from the canal. The team looked at her, confused.

“This is what we’re looking for,” she announced to the room, her voice hard. “Our killer is an artist. He left us a drawing. He thinks this is a game. Let’s prove him wrong.”The first few hours were a slow grind, a bureaucratic crawl that always preceded the hunt. The incident room filled with the low murmur of phone calls and the clatter of keyboards as the team began the painstaking work of building a life for their John Doe. Canvassing teams were dispatched, CCTV footage from the surrounding area was requested, and a list of local suppliers of industrial paints and coatings was being compiled. Sloan prowled the room, a shark in a too-small tank, fueled by bitter canteen coffee. The drawing of the kiln on the whiteboard felt like a mockery, a piece of art hanging in a gallery of grim procedure. She wanted to be out there, kicking down doors, but there were no doors to kick. Not yet.

It was just after 4 p.m. when the first piece of the puzzle fell into place. The call came from the forensic lab. Sloan snatched the receiver, pressing it hard against her ear to block out the room's low hum. “Sloan.” She listened, her knuckles white on the plastic. “Are you sure?… Right. Email me the full report.” She hung up, her expression unreadable. Miller was at her elbow instantly. “Ma’am?”

“It’s not paint. And it’s not primer,” she said, her voice quiet, drawing the attention of the nearest detectives. “Adebayo was on the right track. It’s a ceramic slip. Specifically, a high-fire stoneware body, bone-white. But it’s been mixed with a polymer-based acrylic resin. An industrial binding agent.” She looked around the room. “It’s not something you’d use for throwing a pot. The resin would make it unworkable. It’s designed to be sprayed, to adhere to a non-porous surface, and to dry rock-hard. It’s a custom mix. A bastardisation of old and new technology.”

A young DC, fresh-faced and eager, spoke up. “So we look at the potteries? The ones that are still running?”
“We look at everyone,” Sloan corrected him, her gaze sweeping the map. “The active factories, the hundreds of defunct ones. We look at hobbyists, sculptors, industrial suppliers. This resin isn't something you buy at a craft shop. Someone, somewhere, has access to specialist materials. They know what they’re doing.” The knowledge was a cold weight. The killer wasn’t just an artist; he was a technician.

The second break came an hour later. A call, routed from the public line, was patched through to her desk. The voice on the other end was a woman’s, thin and frayed with anxiety. “I… I’m sorry to bother you. It’s probably nothing. But my son… he didn’t come home last night.” Sloan felt the familiar, sickening lurch. She gestured for Miller to get on an extension. “Tell me your name, love. And your son’s.”

“It’s Jean. Jean Massey. And my boy… my Leo. He’s seventeen. He went out sketching yesterday afternoon. Down by the Trent and Mersey canal. He loves the old factories, the kilns. He finds them… beautiful.” Her voice broke on the last word, a small, splintering sound. Sloan’s eyes closed for a fraction of a second. Sketching. The kilns. “What was he wearing, Jean?” she asked, her own voice softening, the official tone dissolving.

“His usual. Jeans, a dark blue hoodie. He… he always wore a silver watch. A heavy one. It was his grandad’s.”

The pale band on the grey wrist. The missing trophy. It clicked into place with the finality of a cell door locking. “DI Sloan,” she began, the title feeling like a lead weight in her mouth, “I’m going to send a car for you. We need you to come to the station.” She didn’t need to say the rest. The silence on the other end of the line was a universe of dawning horror.

The formal identification was the part of the job Sloan would never get used to. It was a violation, a forced confrontation with the unacceptable. Jean Massey was a small, bird-like woman, swallowed by the cavernous quiet of the mortuary waiting room. She clutched a worn photograph of a smiling, bright-eyed boy with a shock of dark hair. Leo Massey. He had a name now. He had a mother. He was no longer just a grey effigy. He was a gaping hole in someone’s world. Sloan had delegated the task to a trained family liaison officer, but she waited, feeling it was a penance she owed. The quiet sob that eventually filtered through the closed door was a sound she knew would visit her in the dark.

Later, armed with a warrant and a profound sense of trespass, Sloan and Miller stood in Leo Massey’s bedroom. It was a teenage sanctuary, a world away from the cold horror on the towpath. Posters of obscure bands fought for space with charcoal drawings taped to the walls. The sketches were dark, intricate, and full of a brooding talent. They were almost all of Stoke’s industrial ruins: collapsing potbanks, canals choked with weeds, and bottle kilns. Dozens of bottle kilns, drawn from every angle, in every light. They loomed in his drawings, sometimes like silent gods, other times like monsters.

“He was good,” Miller murmured, picking up a sketchbook from a desk littered with charcoal sticks and art books. He flipped through the pages. More kilns, more decay. The style was unmistakable. It was the same hand that had drawn the sketch found in the canal.

“The drawing wasn’t a message from the killer,” Sloan said, the realisation dawning. “It was Leo’s. It must have fallen from his pad during the struggle, or when he was moved.” The theory shifted, the ground moving under her feet. The killer hadn’t left a calling card. He had taken a boy who was obsessed with the city’s grey decay and made him a part of it. He had turned the artist’s gaze back on himself, forcing him to become the very thing he documented. The cruelty of it was absolute.

Miller kept flipping through the sketchbook, then stopped. “Ma’am. Look at this.” He held the book out. On the last few pages, the style changed. The drawings were less architectural, more frantic. They were sketches of a face. A man’s face, long and gaunt, with deep-set, shadowed eyes and a thin, cruel mouth. It was a face you wouldn’t forget. In one sketch, the man was just a portrait. In the next, his mouth was open in a silent scream. And in the last, most disturbing drawing, the man was rendered in a flat, uniform grey, his features barely visible, like a statue. Beneath it, Leo had written a single, cryptic word: ‘The Curator’.“The Curator.” The word hung in the quiet of the boy’s bedroom, a name given to a monster. Sloan looked from the frantic, haunted face in the sketchbook to the ordered chaos of Leo’s creative life. This wasn’t just a random act of violence. This was personal. Leo knew his killer. Or at least, he knew him well enough to become his subject, his obsession, before he became his medium. The killer hadn’t just stolen a watch; he’d stolen the boy’s art, his vision, and twisted it into a final, obscene masterpiece. This changed everything.

“Get this book bagged as evidence, and get this face to every officer in the city,” she said to Miller, her voice tight with a new, sharp-edged energy. “I want it on the briefing boards by morning. I want it run through every database we have. Facial recognition, custody images, known associates of every artist, sculptor, and fired pottery worker in the six towns. I want to know who this man is.” She turned, taking in the room one last time, the ghost of the boy now achingly present in every charcoal smudge and half-finished drawing. “And get a team to go through his computer, his phone. Social media, emails, everything. If Leo knew him, he’s in there somewhere. Find him.”

Back in the fluorescent glare of the incident room, the sketch of ‘The Curator’ was a lightning rod. Copies were pinned to the whiteboard, replacing the crude drawing of the kiln. The gaunt, hollow-eyed face stared out at the room, a silent challenge. The investigation, which had been a wide, speculative trawl through the city’s underbelly, now had a focal point. The team’s energy shifted from bewildered shock to a focused hum. They had a face. They had a name, of sorts. The ghost had begun to take shape. Sloan felt the grim satisfaction of the hunt, a feeling she both relied on and despised. The Curator thought he was a ghost in the machine, a creator in the shadows. Sloan’s job was to drag him, kicking and screaming, into the light.

The next morning, Sloan and Miller drove to the Burslem School of Art, a grand Victorian building that stood in proud defiance of the surrounding decay. It was where Leo Massey had been a star pupil. Inside, the air smelled of turpentine and clay, a clean, creative scent that was a world away from the chemical acridity at the crime scene. They were met by a man named Alistair Finch, the head of the sculpture department. He had a long, weary face, but his eyes were sharp and intelligent behind wire-rimmed spectacles. He led them to his office, a cluttered space filled with maquettes and art books.

“Leo was… singular,” Finch said, after they had explained, in the most delicate terms possible, why they were there. He steepled his long fingers, his gaze distant. “He had a talent that was raw, almost unnerving. Most students his age are trying to find a voice. Leo already had one. He was just trying to control the volume.” Finch had already seen the news report, the carefully worded statement about a body found by the canal. The blood had drained from his face when Sloan laid out a photograph of Leo.

She pushed a copy of the ‘Curator’ sketch across the desk. “Have you ever seen this man? Was he a tutor? Another student? A visitor?”

Finch studied the drawing for a long time, his brow furrowed. “No,” he said slowly. “I don’t know him. His face is… memorable. I wouldn’t forget it.” He paused, picking up the drawing again. “But the name Leo gave him… ‘The Curator’. That resonates. In a certain context.” He looked at Sloan. “Leo was becoming fascinated with a sort of fringe philosophy. A radical wing of the psychogeography movement. They call themselves ‘Urban Reclamationists’. They believe the city’s ruins, the potbanks, the factories, are not scars. They see them as a new, organic art form, created by time and neglect. They believe these places should be preserved, curated, just as you would a collection in a museum.”

A cold dread trickled down Sloan’s spine. “Preserved? Curated?”

“Exactly. Some of them are just academics, writers. Others are more… active,” Finch continued, warming to his theme. “They trespass, they document, they create art in situ. But there are whispers of a more extreme element. People who believe the decay itself is the point. That modern society is the disease, and these ruins are the cure. They’re zealots, DI Sloan. And their gospel is decay. To them, a person like Leo, who saw beauty in it, would be a kindred spirit. But to turn a person *into* a piece of it… that is a terrifying perversion of the idea.”

As Finch spoke, Miller’s phone vibrated. He took the call, his expression sharpening. He covered the mouthpiece. “Ma’am. It’s the team canvassing the chemical suppliers. They’ve got something. A small independent distributor in Longton. The owner remembers a cash sale two weeks ago. A man wanting a specific polymer resin and a bulk order of refined stoneware slip. Said the guy gave him the creeps, so he jotted down his van’s number plate on the invoice.”

Sloan’s focus snapped back from the abstract world of art philosophy to the hard reality of police work. “A full plate?”

Miller’s eyes were bright. “A partial. Three letters and two numbers. But it’s a start. A solid start.”

Sloan stood, thanking Finch for his time. They had two paths now. One was a shadow-world of artistic theory and zealotry, a concept almost too strange to grasp. The other was a partial number plate, a tangible clue that could be entered into a computer, cross-referenced, and traced. One was the ‘why’, the other was the ‘who’. She knew which one she had to follow first. As they walked out into the grey Stoke morning, past laughing students carrying portfolios, she felt the net tightening. ‘The Curator’ wasn’t just a face in a sketchbook anymore. He was a man with a van, and he had made a mistake. He had dealt with the real world, and the real world leaves a trail.The partial number plate was a tangible thing in a case that felt nightmarishly abstract. WR… 52. Back in the incident room, Sloan wrote the characters on the whiteboard herself. They looked stark and promising against the white surface. The sketch of the Curator stared down, his hollow eyes seeming to watch her. The room, which had been subdued, now buzzed with a renewed sense of purpose. They had a scent.

“Run it,” Sloan ordered, her voice cutting through the noise. “PNC, DVLA, every ANPR camera within a fifty-mile radius for the last two weeks. I want every vehicle that starts with WR and ends in 52. Filter for vans and commercial vehicles first. Cross-reference registered keepers against Stoke postcodes. I want names and addresses by the end of the day. If he has a record, I want to know what he had for breakfast. Go.”

The team moved with the focused energy she’d been hoping for. The hunt had transformed from a philosophical exercise into a data-sifting marathon. But as the first lists began to generate, the scale of the task became depressingly clear. The partial combination returned over nine hundred possible vehicles in the wider region. Even filtering for vans and local postcodes left them with a list of nearly sixty. Sixty doors to knock on. Sixty potential faces to match against Leo’s terrified sketch. It was laborious, thankless work. Knocking on the door of a baffled plumber or a delivery driver, trying to gauge their reaction, looking for a flicker of something other than confusion. For the rest of the afternoon, the results trickled in: negative, negative, alibi confirmed, vehicle accounted for, negative. The initial rush of adrenaline slowly bled away, replaced by a familiar, grinding frustration.

Sloan retreated to her desk, leaving Miller to coordinate the teams on the ground. She couldn’t shake the words of Alistair Finch. ‘Urban Reclamationists.’ ‘Their gospel is decay.’ She typed the phrases into her browser, descending into a rabbit hole of obscure forums and angry blogs dedicated to the aesthetics of dereliction. Much of it was pretentious but harmless, photographers swapping tips on trespassing in old factories. But then she found it. A blog, stark and minimalist, titled ‘The Collection’. There were no pictures, only text. Long, rambling manifestos railing against regeneration projects, which the author called ‘the great sanitisation’. He wrote of the city as a body, and its ruins as sacred wounds that should be left to fester beautifully. He spoke of ‘specimens’ of urban life that were being erased by progress, and the need for a ‘Curator’ to preserve them, to turn the transient into the permanent. The language was cold, academic, yet seething with a fanatical rage. There was one post, dated a week ago, that made her breath catch. It was titled ‘New Acquisition’. It spoke of finding a ‘perfect vessel’, one who understood the 'beauty of the ending' and who would be the first piece in a new, vital exhibition.

The phone on her desk shrilled, a piercing sound that made her jump. It was the front desk. A uniform, his voice strained. “Ma’am. We’ve had a call. A woman… she was on her way to the supermarket. Under the A50 flyover, the one near Meir. She saw… well, you’d better come. She said it’s another one.”

Sloan was on her feet before he finished, her chair scraping back violently. The blood drained from her face. Another one. The blog post wasn’t a retrospective. It was a promise. She grabbed her coat, her mind racing. Meir. A sprawling post-war housing estate on the opposite side of the city from the canal. No connection. No pattern. “Miller, with me,” she barked, her voice a low command that cut through the office chatter. “Everyone else,” she said, her voice dropping to a deadly quiet that commanded more attention than any shout, “You find that van. You find it now.”

The scene under the flyover was a vision of urban purgatory. The roar of the traffic overhead was a constant, oppressive weight. The huge concrete support pillars were a canvas of overlapping, faded graffiti. The ground was a mess of broken bottles, fast-food wrappers, and damp, discarded mattresses. It was a place people hurried past, a non-space you taught yourself not to see. And he had used it as his new gallery.

She was propped against a pillar, facing the footpath. A woman, perhaps in her late fifties, her greying hair sculpted into a rigid helmet by the same ghastly slip. The remnants of a smart business suit, a blazer and skirt, were now a single, solid grey carapace. Her arms were folded in her lap in a pose of serene repose. The meticulousness was the same, the flawless, spray-gun finish, the complete erasure of the person beneath. But there was a new element. Cradled in her stiffly folded hands was a small, delicate bird’s nest. Inside it, nestled in the dried mud and twigs, were three small, perfectly smooth pebbles, each one painted the same uniform, soul-crushing grey.

Sloan crouched, the stench of petrol fumes and damp concrete filling her nostrils. Theatricality. Ritual. This wasn’t just a signature; it was an evolving narrative. Leo, the artist of decay, placed in a scene of natural decay. And this woman? A professional, judging by her clothes, placed in a scene of urban decay. The old world and the new. Nature and the city. It was a diptych. Adebayo was already there, his large frame silhouetted against the weak light filtering under the bridge. He didn't even look at Sloan, his eyes fixed on the new victim. “He’s accelerating, Sloan,” the pathologist rumbled, his voice heavy with a terrible finality. “And he’s getting arrogant. He put her right where she’d be found. This isn’t about hiding his work anymore. This is an exhibition opening.”The roar of the traffic overhead was a physical assault, a constant grinding thunder that vibrated through the concrete pillar at Sloan’s back. It was a perfect hell of noise and neglect, and the Curator had seen it as a plinth. The second victim had a name, delivered by a shaken DC Miller minutes after her photo was circulated. Margaret Ellis. Fifty-seven. Head of Urban Regeneration for the City Council. A prime mover in the ‘Potteries Gateway’ project, a controversial scheme to demolish a swathe of derelict terraced streets and a defunct potbank in Etruria to make way for a retail park. She was the enemy personified. The great sanitiser.

“He’s not just killing them, he’s making a point,” Sloan said, her voice gravelly, barely audible over the din. “Leo was the artist who loved the decay. Margaret was the bureaucrat trying to erase it. He’s creating a twisted dialogue with his victims.” She looked at the bird’s nest, a grotesque parody of new life in the hands of the dead. The grey pebbles were sterile eggs. A message of ultimate barrenness. The Curator wasn’t just protesting regeneration; he was declaring it dead on arrival, offering his own horrific alternative.

Back in the incident room, the atmosphere was toxic. The news of a second body had lit a fire under the press, and Superintendent Davies’s earlier desire for containment had evaporated into panicked demands for a result. He paced outside his glass office like a caged animal, his face a mask of fury. Sloan ignored him. She stood at the whiteboard, the two crime scenes now marked with red circles at opposite ends of the city. There was no geographical logic, only a thematic one. The Artist and The Destroyer. Who was next? The Collector? The Historian?

“The blog,” she snapped at the tech team. “Where are we with ‘The Collection’?” A young officer with glasses perched on his nose looked up, startled. “We’re trying to trace the IP, ma’am. He’s using multiple proxies, bouncing the signal all over Eastern Europe. It’s sophisticated. But there’s a metadata footprint in the blog’s source code. A faint one. It suggests the original posts were uploaded from a public Wi-Fi network. We’ve narrowed it down to three hotspots: Hanley library, Stoke-on-Trent College, and the café at the Gladstone Pottery Museum.”

Gladstone. A working museum, a perfectly preserved potbank, a temple to the city’s industrial past. A place the Curator would see as either a sacred site or a sell-out, a piece of sanitised history for tourists. It felt right. “Focus on Gladstone. Get the CCTV from the café for the past month. Cross-reference it with the time stamps on the blog posts,” Sloan ordered. “He’s arrogant, but he’s still human. He needs his coffee.”

A different kind of breakthrough came from the other side of the room. A DC who had been methodically working through the van list let out a low whistle. “Ma’am. I’ve got something. I’ve been cross-referencing the partial plate list with residents who filed official complaints against the Etruria Gateway project. There’s a hit.” Every head in the room turned. “Name’s Julian Vance. Registered keeper of a white Ford Transit, plate starts WRG, ends 52. He lives in a small terraced house in Middleport, right by the canal. He filed three separate, increasingly vitriolic complaints about the demolition. Called it ‘civic vandalism’. And get this.” The DC paused for effect. “His father and grandfather both worked at the potbank they’re tearing down. He was a mould-maker himself, until he was laid off in the late nineties.”

The pieces slammed together with the force of a physical blow. Julian Vance. A man made redundant by the industry’s death, now watching its last remnants being torn down. A man with the skills, the knowledge of materials, and a deep, festering grievance. Sloan walked to the board and picked up the drawing of the Curator. The haunted, gaunt face seemed to sneer at her. “Pull up his file. Is there a custody photo?” A few keystrokes later, an image flashed up on the main screen. A mugshot, ten years old, from a public order offence during a protest. The face was younger, angrier, but it was him. The same deep-set eyes, the same thin, cruel line of a mouth. Julian Vance *was* the Curator.

“We have him,” Miller breathed, his voice a mix of awe and dread.

“We have a name and an address,” Sloan corrected, her own voice dangerously calm. “We don’t have him until he’s in a cell.” She looked at the map. Middleport. Another canalside location, a warren of old industrial streets. The perfect place for a workshop. The perfect place for a ghost to hide. “Tactical firearms unit on standby, but I want a quiet approach first. Uniforms to seal the street, plain clothes for the door. I’m going in. Miller, you’re with me.”

As they geared up, a final piece of information came through from the tech team. They’d found him on the Gladstone CCTV. A gaunt man in a dark coat, sitting alone in the corner of the café, nursing a single cup of tea for two hours, his laptop open in front of him. The time stamp matched the upload of the ‘New Acquisition’ blog post to the minute. He had sat in the heart of the city’s preserved past to write the epitaph for its future. The arrogance of it was breathtaking. Sloan pulled on her stab vest, the weight a familiar, grim comfort. This was it. The end of the exhibition. She was no longer a spectator. She was going to tear the gallery down.The street in Middleport was a relic, a narrow channel of terraced houses hemmed in by the canal on one side and the railway line on the other. It was a place where the past had not been curated, but had simply been left to quietly crumble. The bricks were the colour of dried blood, the air held the damp, metallic scent of the waterway. It was the perfect habitat for a ghost like Julian Vance. The police presence was a silent, creeping occupation. Uniformed officers materialised at either end of the street, their cars blocking access, their quiet authority a stark contrast to the peeling paint and grimy net curtains of the houses. Sloan and Miller, along with two plain-clothes officers, walked the last fifty yards on foot, their footsteps echoing unnervingly in the sudden quiet. Number 17 was indistinguishable from its neighbours, except for one detail. The front door was painted a flat, matte grey, the exact shade of the victims. It wasn’t a welcome mat; it was a declaration.

They didn’t use a ram. A quiet click from a lock-pick, a gentle push, and they were in, melting into the shadows of the narrow hallway. The house was cold and unnervingly quiet. It smelled of bleach and something else, a faint, dusty, clay-like scent. The front room was furnished with a single armchair and a small television, its screen dark and blank. There were no photographs, no books, no newspapers. It was less a living space and more a waiting room. The kitchen at the back was similarly sterile. Every surface was wiped clean, the draining board was empty, a single grey mug sat beside the sink. It was the home of a man who had systematically erased his own life, long before he had started on anyone else’s. He had curated himself down to nothing.

It was the door leading to the cellar that gave him away. Unlike the pristine grey door at the front, this one was scuffed and smeared with the same fine, pale dust they’d found at the crime scene. A low hum vibrated up through the floorboards. Sloan drew her sidearm, the familiar weight doing little to steady the tremor in her hand. Miller was a tense shadow at her shoulder. They descended the steep wooden steps into the earth-smelling dark, their torch beams cutting sharp, nervous cones through the gloom. The hum grew louder, coming from a large dehumidifier in the corner, working to keep the subterranean air bone-dry. The basement was his studio.

It was a laboratory of cold fury. A professional-grade spray gun, meticulously cleaned, hung from a hook on the wall. A powerful air compressor stood beside it. Neatly stacked against the far wall were bags of high-fire stoneware slip, and beside them, a large drum, now only a quarter full, of the polymer resin. The walls were covered not in sketches, but in technical drawings, chemical formulae, and pasted articles about the decline of the potteries. On a large workbench in the centre of the room, under the glare of a bare bulb, lay his current project. It was a large-scale map of the Etruria Valley, with the footprint of the doomed potbank marked out in red. Around it were small, grey-coated objects. A brick. A shard of a decorated plate. A child’s toy car. They were artefacts he had rescued, specimens from the ruins, each one ‘preserved’ in his signature style. This was his museum of the lost.

But Vance was not there. The space was prepared, but empty of its creator. Miller moved towards the workbench. “Ma’am, there’s a note.” Pinned to the centre of the map was a single sheet of high-quality drawing paper. On it, in the same precise architectural lettering as his manifestos, were three words: “The Final Commission.” Tucked underneath it was a photograph. It was a press photo of a portly, smiling man in a hard hat and high-vis jacket, shaking hands with a councillor. Sloan recognised him instantly. Marcus Thorne, CEO of the development company behind the Etruria Gateway project. The man swinging the wrecking ball. He wasn’t the next victim; he was the centrepiece. The final, brutal statement.

Sloan’s blood ran cold. This wasn’t a flight. This was an invitation. Vance had left his workshop open for them, a retrospective of his work, before the main event. He knew they had identified him. He knew they were coming. The entire investigation had been part of his performance, and they were merely the audience he had chosen. She looked at the map, at the red-marked zone of demolition. A calendar page was pinned beside it, today’s date circled. Beneath it, a time: 6 A.M. Sunrise. The scheduled start of the primary demolition. He was going to install his final piece at the site, a permanent, horrific monument to his rage, dedicated to the man who was destroying his past.

“He’s there,” Sloan said, her voice a low, urgent command that galvanized the room. “He’s at the potbank in Etruria. He’s got Thorne.” The quiet, methodical investigation had just shattered. This was no longer a hunt; it was a rescue mission, a race against the dawn. “Get me armed response at the Etruria site now! Full containment, but no approach until I get there. He wants an audience, he’s about to get one.” She was already halfway up the cellar steps, Miller at her heels, the sterile quiet of the house now feeling like the silence of a tomb. They burst out into the night, the cold air a shock after the dry fug of the basement. The Curator was finished with his smaller exhibitions. He was moving on to his grand opening, and dawn was only a few hours away.The blue lights of the convoy threw strobing, frantic patterns against the stained brickwork of the city. They tore through the empty pre-dawn streets, a river of urgency flowing towards the old industrial heartland of Etruria. Sloan sat rigid in the passenger seat, the city flashing past as a meaningless blur of shuttered shops and sleeping houses. The weight of the stab vest was a tight, constricting presence, a physical manifestation of the knot in her gut. She wasn't just chasing a killer anymore. She was keeping an appointment, one set by a madman on a stage of his own choosing. Vance hadn't fled. He had invited them to the closing night of his exhibition, and Marcus Thorne was the final, living installation.

The Etruria potbank was a sprawling necropolis of industry. It loomed out of the darkness, a jagged silhouette against a sky that was just beginning to bruise with the first hint of dawn. Multiple bottle kilns, the city’s silent ghosts, stood sentinel over a chaotic ruin of collapsed roofs, smashed windows, and skeletal ironwork. The armed response team had established a loose, silent perimeter. Black-clad figures with night-vision goggles and carbines moved like phantoms at the edge of the site’s broken perimeter fence, their professionalism a stark contrast to the surrounding dereliction. The tactical commander, a brisk, no-nonsense inspector named Graves, met Sloan by her car, his face illuminated by the red glow of a command vehicle’s interior light.

“He’s in there, ma’am,” Graves said, his voice a low, clipped whisper. “Thermal scans picked up two heat signatures in the main kiln yard, at the base of the largest structure. One stationary, one moving. We have snipers on two of the taller roofs with a clear line of sight, but the target is using the hostage for cover. He knows we’re here. He’s been flashing a torch at our positions.”

“He wants us to watch,” Sloan said, her eyes fixed on the immense, dark mass of the factory. “He’s been performing for an audience of one so far. Me. Now he wants to expand his viewership.” She turned to Graves, her expression grim. “No sudden moves, Inspector. No tear gas, no storming the gates. He’s not a cornered animal; he’s a director on his opening night. Any unexpected noise, any deviation from his script, and he’ll kill Thorne. I’m going in.”

Graves stared at her. “Ma’am, with respect, that’s not procedure.”

“Procedure is a luxury for a different kind of monster, Inspector,” Sloan retorted, her voice flint-hard. “This man is a zealot. He thinks he’s an artist, a saviour. You can’t negotiate with a man like that using a megaphone. I have to talk to him. On his terms. On his stage.” She looked at Miller, whose face was a pale disc in the gloom. “You and I, and a two-man tactical team for backup. Silent entry, visual support only unless I give the word. Is that clear?” Graves hesitated for a second, then gave a curt nod. The sheer certainty in her voice left no room for argument.

They breached the perimeter through a collapsed section of wall, the crunch of broken saggars and brick dust under their boots sounding like gunshots in the profound silence. The air inside the complex was thick with the smell of cold soot, damp earth, and a century of neglect. It was a labyrinth of crumbling workshops and echoing, cavernous halls where hulking, rust-eaten machinery stood like the fossilised remains of great iron beasts. The two ARV officers moved ahead, their movements fluid and economical, weapon systems scanning the endless shadows. Sloan followed, her own pistol held low, her senses screaming. Every drip of water, every skittering rat, every moan of the wind through a shattered roof was a potential threat. It felt like walking through one of Leo Massey’s dark, unsettling drawings. They were inside the Curator’s masterpiece.

They found him in the heart of the complex, in a vast, open courtyard dominated by the largest of the bottle kilns. The structure rose a hundred feet into the lightening sky, its brickwork blackened with age, its mouth a gaping black arch. Vance had set his stage at its base. Marcus Thorne, the developer, was strapped to a heavy wooden chair, his expensive suit rumpled and torn, his face a mask of abject terror. His mouth was sealed with a strip of grey duct tape. Standing calmly beside him was Julian Vance. He wore a set of clean, grey workman’s overalls and held the industrial spray gun in his right hand, its coiled hose leading back to the compressor and the drum of ceramic slip. He had positioned a single, powerful work light on the ground, pointing it upwards, casting his own face and that of his captive in a stark, theatrical glare. He looked like a high priest officiating at a sacrifice.

As Sloan and Miller stepped into the light, Vance turned his head. He didn't look surprised or afraid. He looked satisfied. A thin smile touched his lips. “DI Sloan,” he said, his voice quiet, calm, and resonant in the cavernous space. “You received my invitation. I was beginning to think you wouldn’t make the premiere.” He gestured with the spray gun towards the bound developer. “I’m afraid my final acquisition is not yet complete. I was waiting for the guest of honour.”

“Let him go, Julian,” Sloan said, her voice steady, ignoring the armed officers melting into the shadows at the edge of the courtyard. She took a slow step forward, keeping her hands visible. “This isn’t a commission. It’s murder.”

Vance let out a short, dry laugh, a sound devoid of any humour. “Murder is what he does,” he said, nodding at Thorne. “He murders memory. He murders history. He eradicates identity with a bulldozer and a budget, and calls it progress. I, on the other hand… I preserve. I create permanence.” He caressed the barrel of the spray gun. “I am giving this man an honour. He will become a monument. A permanent testament to the very decay he sought to destroy. His final act will be to become a part of the collection he despised. It’s a perfect, beautiful irony. Don’t you think?” His eyes, deep-set and burning with a feverish light, were fixed on Sloan, seeking her validation, her understanding. He didn’t just want her to stop him; he wanted her to *see* him.Sloan kept her own voice as level and cold as the concrete floor. “I see a terrified man tied to a chair, Julian. There’s no irony in terror. There’s no art in cruelty. There is only ugliness.” She took another slow, deliberate step into the circle of light, drawing his attention further from his victim. “You talk about preservation. Let’s talk about Leo Massey. Was that preservation?”

For the first time, a flicker of something other than cold resolve crossed Vance’s face. It was a flash of irritation, of a professor being questioned by a particularly slow student. “Leo understood,” he insisted, his voice taking on a lecturing tone. “He saw the beauty. He spent his days documenting the transition, the slow, graceful collapse. All I did was complete the process. I made him one with his art. I elevated him from a mere observer to the subject itself. He is an icon of the very aesthetic he worshipped. It was a gift.”

“You coated a seventeen-year-old boy in ceramic slip and left him by a canal,” Sloan stated, the facts a brutal counterpoint to his delusional narrative. “You suffocated him in grey. You didn’t elevate him, you erased him. You took a voice that was just learning to speak and you silenced it forever. Just like you did with Margaret Ellis. You think that nest you put in her hands was a profound statement? It was a prop. A cheap, theatrical trick. You’re not a curator, Julian. You’re a vandal with a gimmick.”

The word ‘gimmick’ struck him like a physical blow. His face, which had been alight with a self-righteous fire, contorted into a mask of pure fury. The calm, superior artist was gone, replaced by the bitter, spurned man from the council complaint files. His grip tightened on the spray gun, his knuckles white. The low hum of the compressor suddenly seemed louder, a predatory growl in the pre-dawn quiet. Thorne whimpered behind his gag, his eyes wide with a terror that was now absolute. He was no longer a symbol to Vance; he was just the nearest object on which to vent his rage.

“You see nothing,” Vance hissed, his voice losing its resonance, becoming thin and sharp. “You’re just like them. You walk through these sacred places and all you see is crime scenes, procedure, evidence bags. You can’t see the soul of it. The soul I am trying to save.” He gestured wildly with the gun towards the crumbling factory around them. “This is my gallery. My church. And he,” he jabbed the gun towards Thorne, “was going to bulldoze it for a car park and a discount shoe shop. He is the vandal. He is the disease. And you are defending him. You are no better than he is.”

The first real light of dawn was beginning to seep into the sky, turning the clouds from bruised purple to a soft, funereal grey. It silhouetted the kiln, making it seem even more vast and ancient. Sloan saw her chance, a desperate, dangerous gamble. She had to shatter his narrative completely, force him off the stage he had so carefully constructed. She couldn't reason with the artist, so she had to provoke the man. She shrugged, a gesture of casual dismissal that was utterly at odds with the tension of the scene. “Maybe he’s right, then,” she said, her voice laced with a cold indifference. “Maybe a shoe shop is better than this. At least it’s useful. At least it’s for the living. All you’ve done is add more ghosts to a graveyard. Your 'art' won't be remembered. It'll be cleaned off by the council, your victims will be buried, and this place will still get knocked down. In a year, no one will even remember your name.”

It was the ultimate heresy. She had not only denigrated his art, but she had declared his entire crusade futile. The rage in Vance’s eyes became something incandescent. He let out a wordless scream of frustration and took a decisive step towards Thorne, raising the spray gun. “Then I will make a monument no one can ever forget!” he shrieked, his finger tightening on the trigger. In that split second, as his focus shifted entirely to his victim, Sloan saw the tiny, brilliant red dot of a laser sight appear on the back of Vance’s grey overall, just between his shoulder blades. She didn't have to give the order. Graves’s snipers had their own.

“Julian, no!” Sloan shouted, a desperate, final plea that was not for him, but for the men on the rooftops. But it was too late. Vance’s world had shrunk to the terrified face of Marcus Thorne and the nozzle of the gun in his hand. The sharp, whip-crack of a high-velocity rifle shot echoed through the courtyard, a sound far louder and more final than anything that had come before. It was not the shattering report she had expected. It was a dull, metallic thud. The sniper hadn't aimed for Vance. He'd aimed for his art. The bullet struck the nozzle of the spray gun, which exploded in a shower of sparks and shattered metal. The back-pressure from the hose caused it to whip around violently, spewing a jet of thick, grey slip across Vance’s chest and face. He staggered back, roaring in shock and pain, dropping the useless weapon and clawing at his eyes, which were now clogged with the very substance he had used to erase others. His final masterpiece was a ruin, and he was its first and only casualty.For a frozen second, the only sound was Vance’s choked, gurgling cry and the hiss of the ruptured hose as it writhed on the ground like a dying snake, vomiting a thick grey torrent onto the brick dust. Then the scene exploded into motion. The two ARV officers who had been shadows at the edge of the courtyard became a physical reality, moving with a speed that seemed impossible, their black uniforms converging on the blinded, staggering figure of Julian Vance. There was no negotiation, no command to surrender. They hit him like a train, two solid masses of tactical gear and muscle, driving him backwards and down onto the hard ground. The clatter of his body hitting the floor was followed by the sharp, authoritative clicks of plasticuffs. It was over in less than five seconds. The Curator’s grand performance had ended not with a bang, or even a whimper, but with the brutal, efficient thud of his own subjugation.

While the tactical team secured their prisoner, Sloan and Miller rushed towards the chair. Marcus Thorne was trembling violently, his eyes screwed shut as if he couldn’t bear to look, his body still braced for the cold, suffocating spray that had never come. Sloan pulled a small knife from a pouch on her vest and sawed through the duct tape across his mouth. He gasped, sucking in the cold morning air in huge, ragged sobs. Miller was already working on the thick plastic cable ties that bound Thorne’s wrists and ankles to the heavy chair. As the last restraint fell away, the developer, a man whose face was a regular feature in the business pages, simply folded in on himself, sliding from the chair onto his knees and weeping with a raw, animal relief that stripped away all his authority and power, leaving only a terrified, middle-aged man in a ruined suit. Sloan placed a hand briefly on his shaking shoulder, a gesture of grounding, before turning away. The victim was safe. Her part in his story was over.

Vance was hauled to his feet, a pathetic and grotesque figure. The grey slip was already starting to set on his face, turning it into a cracked, lumpy mask. He was still clawing at his eyes, blinded and panicked. The cold, controlled artist was gone, replaced by a raving, terrified creature. “You can’t! It’s not finished!” he screamed, his voice muffled by the paste that clogged his mouth. “The collection… it needs its centrepiece! You don’t understand the aesthetic!” He twisted in the officers’ grip, a marionette with its strings cut, his final, desperate words a madman’s art critique. As they frog-marched him away, a trail of grey dripped from his face onto the ground, small, sterile spots of his own making. He was no longer the Curator, but just another specimen, catalogued and removed from the scene.

The sun was now properly above the horizon, its weak, watery light filtering through the skeletal remains of the factory roof, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the air. The courtyard was suddenly crowded with uniforms, paramedics, and forensics officers beginning their methodical work. The sense of an intimate, terrifying performance had evaporated, replaced by the mundane machinery of the state. Sloan stood beside Miller, the adrenaline draining out of her, leaving a profound, bone-deep weariness in its place. The bottle kiln loomed over them, its brickwork now visible in the morning light as a tapestry of red, brown, and black, stained by a hundred years of fire and rain. It was, she admitted to herself with a grim sense of irony, beautiful in its own way.

“He really believed it,” Miller said quietly, following her gaze. “He thought he was saving something.”

“He wasn’t saving it, he was embalming it,” Sloan replied, her voice rough. “He loved the idea of this place so much he couldn’t stand that it was still part of the living world, a world that changes and moves on. He wanted to freeze it, turn it into a dead thing he could control. The people were just part of the scenery.” She thought of Leo’s frantic sketches, of a boy trying to capture the soul of these places, a soul Vance had tried to snuff out and replace with a flawless, grey shell. This whole tragedy was a battle over the city’s corpse, fought by a boy who wanted to sketch its ghost and a man who wanted to wear its death mask.

Later, as she drove home, the city was waking up. Milk floats hummed along suburban streets, and the first commuters were heading to the station. Stoke-on-Trent unfolded around her, the familiar ranks of terraced houses and the skeletal kilns on the skyline no longer looking like a threat, but just… home. A complicated, bruised, and resilient place. A city of muted colours, as she’d thought before, but she saw it differently now. The grey wasn’t an absence of colour; it was a colour in its own right, the colour of clay and clouds, of history and hard truths. Vance had tried to weaponize it, to make it a symbol of his sterile, dead-end vision. But he had failed. The grey was just a colour. It was what you did with it that mattered.

She let herself into her small terraced house in Penkhull. The silence was a welcome relief. The phone was no longer vibrating on the draining board. The only sound was the slow drip-drip-drip from the sink. The u-bend. Her own small, domestic failure was still there, waiting for her. She looked at the pair of marigolds lying beside the sink, the smear of something unspeakable still on the tea towel. A typical Wednesday. She peeled off her coat, the familiar scent of stale coffee a comfort of sorts, and knelt before the porcelain god. The gurgle from the pipes was a miserable, mundane sound, but it was the sound of life, of things that needed fixing. And for now, that was enough.With a final, protesting groan of metal on metal, the u-bend’s collar gave way. Sloan twisted it free, a gout of foul-smelling black water and sludge sloshing into the basin she’d placed beneath. The stench was biblical, a potent brew of old food, soap scum, and decay. She worked with a grim, methodical focus, her fingers, still clad in the yellow marigolds, scraping out the compacted filth. It was a solid, tangible problem, a knot of unpleasantness that could be physically removed and discarded. Ten minutes later, with the trap reassembled and the tap running, the water swirled away with a clean, satisfying gurgle. The sound was a small miracle of domestic order restored. She leaned her forehead against the cool ceramic of the sink, utterly spent, the victory over the plumbing feeling almost as significant as the one in the kiln yard.

The following morning, the incident room was a place of ghosts and paperwork. The energy of the hunt had been replaced by the weary hum of administration. The whiteboard, once a chaotic tapestry of maps, photos, and frantic scribbles, was being wiped clean, the face of the Curator and his victims disappearing under long sweeps of a dry cloth. Phones were being disconnected, and the borrowed detectives were packing up their files, ready to return to the more mundane realities of burglary and car theft. The brief, intense community forged by the crisis was dissolving, leaving behind a mountain of reports to be filed in triplicate. The machinery of justice, having consumed the horror, was now digesting it into a series of neat, bureaucratic summaries.

Superintendent Davies called her into his office just before noon. He was beaming, a sight Sloan found far more unsettling than his usual clipped irritation. He held a copy of the morning’s Sentinel, the headline bold: ‘KILN KILLER CAUGHT’. The story beneath was a carefully managed piece of public relations, praising the ‘tireless efforts of a dedicated team’ and the ‘swift, decisive action’ that had brought a reign of terror to an end. Vance was a ‘deranged loner’, his motivations reduced to a simplistic footnote. “A textbook operation, Sloan,” Davies said, gesturing for her to sit, an invitation she ignored. “The Chief is delighted. Press conference is at two. I’ll be leading, of course, but I want you on the podium with me. Show a united front.” He smiled again, the polished, empty smile of a man who could already feel the positive impact on his career trajectory.

Sloan looked at him, her face a neutral mask. “Thank you, sir, but I think DI Miller would be a better choice. He put in the legwork on the van, and it would be good experience for him.” She had no intention of standing on a stage while Davies spun a tidy narrative from the raw, ugly facts of the last forty-eight hours. The thought of it made her stomach turn. Davies’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second. “As you wish,” he said, his tone a little cooler. “But make no mistake, this is a win for the whole department. For all of us.” Sloan nodded, her gaze flat. A win. She thought of Leo Massey’s grey, silent face, and the word tasted like ash in her mouth. She left the office without another word, closing the glass door on the superintendent and his victory.

She found Miller staring at the now-empty whiteboard, a mug of tea cradled in his hands. He looked older than he had three days ago, the boyish eagerness in his eyes replaced by a quiet, haunted gravity. He wasn't a new suit anymore; the job had finally tailored him. “Ma’am,” he said, nodding towards Davies’s office. “The press conference?” Sloan shook her head. “You’re up, Miller. Just stick to the script. The super wants a hero, you can give him one.” A faint, wry smile touched Miller’s lips. “I don’t feel much like a hero.” “None of us ever do,” she replied. The silence stretched between them for a moment, an acknowledgement of all they had seen. “You did good work, Miller. Solid work.” Coming from Sloan, the simple words landed with the weight of a formal commendation. He nodded, his gaze dropping to his mug. “Thank you, ma’am.”

Later, sitting at her own desk, faced with the first of a dozen reports she needed to write, her eyes fell on a file containing the evidence photos from Leo Massey’s bedroom. She stared at a picture of one of his sketches, a dark, beautiful, and brooding image of the canal at dusk. The clinical language of the report—‘victim one’, ‘cause of death: asphyxiation’, ‘motive: ideological grievance’—felt like a desecration. It was a lie. The truth was in that drawing. It was in the grief of the small, bird-like woman she had met in the mortuary. Before the case file could be closed and sent to the archives, there was one final, unofficial piece of business to attend to. She picked up her car keys. The paperwork, like the u-bend, could wait just a little longer.

The small terraced house was unnervingly quiet, the curtains half-drawn against the afternoon light. Jean Massey answered the door, her face pale and etched with a grief so profound it seemed to have physically diminished her. She looked at Sloan with eyes that seemed to hold no more tears. Sloan didn’t offer a handshake or a meaningless platitude. “I’m sorry to intrude, Mrs Massey,” she began, her voice softer than it had been all day. “I just wanted to come in person. To tell you that we caught him.” Jean Massey just nodded, clutching a faded cardigan around herself as if warding off a chill that came from within. She led Sloan into the living room, a tidy space where a half-empty mug of tea sat cold on a coaster.

“They said on the news he was… mad,” Jean whispered, her voice a fragile thread. “That he hated the council.” Sloan sat opposite her, leaning forward slightly. “He was mad, yes. But it wasn’t just about the council. It was about what he thought the city was. And he saw something in Leo.” She paused, choosing her words with a care she rarely afforded anyone. “Your son was an incredible artist, Jean. He saw this city, its beauty and its sadness, in a way most people never do. The man who killed him… he was an artist too, in his own mind. He saw Leo’s talent, and he was jealous of it. He wanted to possess it.” She looked directly at the grieving mother. “The only reason we identified him, the only reason we caught him before he could hurt anyone else, was because of a drawing we found in Leo’s sketchbook. His art saved a man’s life yesterday. I wanted you to know that. His life, and his talent, they weren’t for nothing. They made a difference.”

Jean Massey didn’t speak for a long time. She simply looked down at her hands, twisting a loose thread on her cardigan. Then, she stood and walked over to the mantelpiece, picking up a framed charcoal sketch. It was a portrait of her, captured in a moment of laughter, the lines quick, confident, and full of love. She held it out for Sloan to see. “He was my boy,” she said, her voice finally breaking, a single, hot tear tracing a path down her cheek. “He was my beautiful, clever boy.” Sloan nodded, the professional wall she maintained so rigorously cracking under the weight of the simple, devastating truth. There was nothing more to say. She had delivered her message, the only piece of comfort she had to offer, a small, solid fact in a universe of pain. She stayed for a while longer, sitting in the quiet room, a silent witness to a grief that would never truly end, a caretaker of the living, after all.### Chapter 5

The weeks that followed were a long, slow burial. Not of bodies, but of facts. The raw, ragged horror of the Curator case was systematically dissected, catalogued, and interred in the deep, sterile archives of the criminal justice system. The official narrative was neat and tidy; Julian Vance, driven by a psychotic break and a fanatical obsession, had been apprehended and, following psychiatric evaluation, was deemed unfit to stand trial. He was committed to a high-security facility, disappearing from the public eye as completely as one of his victims under a coat of grey slip. The Etruria Gateway project, after a respectful pause for the headlines to fade, resumed its slow, grinding progress. The city, it seemed, had a short memory for its monsters. For DI Sloan, the grey of the case simply bled into the grey of the endless paperwork that followed, each signature on a report feeling like a shovelful of earth on a closed coffin.

Autumn arrived, a damp, melancholic season that suited the city’s mood. The bruised skies returned, and a persistent drizzle seemed to wash the last of the summer’s colour from the streets. In the station, a fragile normality reasserted itself. DI Miller, who had handled himself with a clipped, nervous competence at the press conference, was no longer the lanky, wide-eyed lad from the start of the year. The horror had settled in him, carving out a new, quiet space behind his eyes. He moved with a more deliberate gait, the shock of the job now worn like a well-fitted coat rather than a new suit. He and Sloan spoke little of the case, but an unspoken understanding passed between them in the weary glances over lukewarm coffee, a shared memory of standing in the pre-dawn chill of a kiln yard, waiting for a madman’s world to end.

It was a Friday, late in October. The sky outside the station windows was the colour of wet slate, and the week was winding down with the low, exhausted hum of people anticipating the weekend. Sloan was staring at a fresh pile of files related to a string of joyriders, the sheer, mundane stupidity of it a welcome relief. Her phone rang, the sound sharp and intrusive in the relative quiet. She saw Miller’s name on the screen and felt a familiar, tired tightening in her chest. His voice, when he spoke, was not the high, thin wire of fresh horror she had come to associate with a bad call. It was something else; low, hesitant, and deeply perplexed.

“Ma’am. We’ve got one. It’s… strange.”

Sloan closed her eyes for a second, leaning back in her creaking chair. “How strange, Miller?”

“A house in the Westlands. A man named Alastair Finch. Cleaner found him this afternoon.” The name sent a jolt through her. Alistair Finch. The head of sculpture at the art school, the weary academic who had told them about the ‘Urban Reclamationists’. The man who had helped them understand Leo. “Miller, what kind of strange?” she asked again, her voice now sharp with a focused urgency. There was a pause. “You just need to see it, ma'am. There's... a lot of feathers.”

The Westlands was a different city. The tight, soot-stained terraces of Penkhull and Middleport gave way to wide, leafy avenues and large, detached houses set back from the road behind manicured lawns and high hedges. It was a place where people bought security, a postcode that was supposed to act as a shield against the uglier realities of the world. The police cars and ambulance parked outside a handsome mock-Tudor house looked like a tear in the fabric of that comfortable reality. The front garden was immaculate, a riot of late-blooming roses and neatly trimmed boxwood. Sloan badged the uniformed sergeant at the door, a veteran whose face was a mask of grim confusion.

“Victim’s in the study, ma’am,” the sergeant murmured. “Cleaner’s in the kitchen with a WPC, in a right state. Says the house was locked up tight when she got here, alarm was set. She let herself in, found him. No sign of a break-in, nothing seems to be missing.”

Sloan stepped inside. The house was as pristine as the garden, a show-home of quiet, academic wealth. Polished wood floors, walls lined with bookshelves, abstract art hanging in carefully considered spaces. It was tasteful, expensive, and utterly impersonal. Miller was waiting for her at the door to a room at the back of the house, his expression confirming the sergeant’s bewilderment. He simply pointed inside. “I don’t know what to make of it, ma’am. It’s a locked room. A locked room full of feathers.”

She stepped past him into the study. The room was book-lined, dominated by a large mahogany desk. Alistair Finch lay on his back on a rich Persian rug in the centre of the room. He was dressed in a tweed jacket and corduroy trousers, his wire-rimmed spectacles lying on the floor a few inches from his head. There was a small, dark mark on his temple, a discreet wound that seemed almost an afterthought. But it was the scene itself that made the breath catch in Sloan’s throat. Finch lay in the centre of a perfect, dense circle of pure white feathers. Thousands of them. They formed a soft, white corona nearly six feet in diameter, a bizarre halo on the floor. The air was still, and the slightest movement from the doorway sent a few of them drifting lazily, like snow. There was no pillow ripped open, no sign of a struggle. The rest of the room was in perfect order. It was a deliberate, meticulous arrangement, as theatrical in its own way as the Curator’s work, but its meaning was terrifyingly obscure. It was as if an angel had violently exploded, leaving only its victim and its plumage behind.The cold logic of the locked room grated against the impossible theatre of the scene. While the forensics team meticulously collected feathers and dusted for non-existent prints, Sloan stood in Finch's pristine kitchen, the faint scent of lavender polish a jarring counterpoint to the reality in the next room. The cleaner, now calmer, had confirmed what the alarm logs suggested: Finch was a man of rigid routine. He set the alarm every morning when he went to his study to work, and disarmed it only when he left the house. For the killer to have created such a scene, they would have needed hours, not minutes. And they would have needed to do it without Finch raising an alarm, without a single sign of struggle, before finally locking the house from the inside and vanishing into thin air.

"It's not possible," Miller said, having completed his own walk-through of the property. "There's no second key. No hidden entrance. No conveniently open windows. It's a hermetically sealed crime scene."

"Then we're looking at the scene wrong," Sloan countered, her mind racing through the impossibilities. "Either the cleaner is lying, or the killer was let in. Or," she added, a new, unsettling thought forming, "the killer never left." They both knew the house had been thoroughly searched. The idea was absurd, yet in a case that began with a man surrounded by a perfect circle of feathers, absurdity felt like a reasonable starting point.

The first reports from the background check on Finch began to trickle in, painting a picture of a man as neat and ordered as his home. His finances were sound, his social life quiet, his professional standing impeccable. There were no jilted lovers, no gambling debts, no shady business deals. He was a man who appeared to have no enemies. Yet he was lying on his study floor with a hole in his head. The contradiction was absolute. It was the name from the notebook, 'Kallos', that provided the first crack in the smooth facade of Finch’s life.

Miller found it buried in Finch's university emails. "Ma'am. I've got a chain of correspondence here from about three months ago. It's with a postgraduate student. A researcher in classical art history named Elias Vance." The name hit Sloan like a physical shock. Vance. It couldn't be a coincidence. "Any relation to Julian?" she asked, her voice tight.

"He's Julian Vance's nephew," Miller confirmed, reading from his screen. "Julian's brother's son. The emails are about the student's thesis. It's titled 'Kallos: The Aesthetic of the Perfect Form in Hellenic Art'. Finch was his academic advisor." The pieces began to shift, forming a new and terrifying pattern. The art tutor, the Curator's nephew, and a thesis on the aesthetics of perfection. "What's the tone of the emails?"

"Respectful. Professional. Mostly Finch giving feedback on drafts. But the last one… it's from Finch, about a week ago. He's formally withdrawing as Elias's advisor. He says he has 'profound ethical and intellectual disagreements with the direction of the research' and that he can no longer support the 'dangerous perversions of classical philosophy' being espoused in the thesis. He recommends the university review the student’s position."

A motive. A professional rupture so severe a respected academic tried to torpedo a student's career. Sloan felt a cold dread spread through her. "Find this student. Find Elias Vance. Now." She looked at the image on her phone again. *The feathers are not for flight, but for the fall.* It wasn't Finch's note to himself. It was a quote. It was the killer's message, left for Finch to find moments before he died. A calling card, just like the Curator's drawing.

The search for Elias Vance led them not to a student flat, but back to the art school. He wasn't just a researcher; he was also a practicing artist, a sculptor who had been granted a small, private studio in the labyrinthine upper floors of the building. The dean, a harried-looking woman who was pale with shock at the news of Finch's death, gave them the keys, her hands trembling. "Elias?" she said, her brow furrowed. "He's brilliant. Intense. A bit of a loner, but his work is… extraordinary. He won the undergraduate prize last year. Alistair Finch himself called him a prodigy."

The studio was at the end of a long, dusty corridor, tucked away from the communal workshops. The air outside the door was cold, but a strange, cloying, sweet smell hung in the corridor, like cheap perfume mixed with something chemical. Miller put his hand on the doorknob, but Sloan stopped him. "Wait." She knelt down, her eyes scanning the floor. There, barely visible in the gloom, was a single, tiny, pure white feather, lying against the scuffed skirting board.

They didn't knock. Miller opened the door, and they stepped inside. The studio was large and flooded with pale light from a huge attic window. But it wasn’t the light that stunned them into silence. The room was a gallery of white. Half a dozen life-sized sculptures stood on plinths around the room, each one a masterpiece of classical form. They were figures from Greek mythology—Icarus with his arms outstretched, Narcissus gazing downwards, a stoic Achilles. They were exquisitely rendered in what looked like white marble, their musculature perfect, their faces serene and beautiful. But the material wasn’t marble. It was plaster, coated in a flawless, smooth, matte-white gesso. And from the back of each statue, sprouting from their shoulder blades, were huge, magnificent wings, crafted from thousands of real, white feathers.

In the centre of the room, on a low workbench, were bags of plaster, tubs of gesso, and several large, clear plastic sacks filled with the same downy white feathers they had found at the crime scene. And sitting calmly on a stool, as if he had been waiting for them, was a young man. He had the same gaunt bone structure and deep-set eyes as his uncle, but where Julian Vance’s face had been a mask of bitter rage, his was one of unsettling, serene beauty. He looked like one of his own statues brought to life. He gave Sloan a small, polite smile.

"Detective Inspector," Elias Vance said, his voice soft and melodic. "I'm so glad you appreciate my work. Did you find Professor Finch's final critique illuminating?"### Chapter 6

Sloan stared at the young man, a perfect, chilling echo of his uncle. The same fanatical light burned in his eyes, but where Julian’s had been the wild, desperate fire of a man drowning in grievance, Elias’s was the cold, steady glow of a distant star. It was the absolute certainty of a god, or a madman who believed himself to be one. The air in the studio was thick with the sweet, chemical smell she’d noticed in the hall, which she now identified as the gesso he used to coat his creations. Miller stood frozen a few feet behind her, his hand hovering near his sidearm, his face a mask of disbelief. This was not the end of a chase; it was a curated reception.

“Your work?” Sloan said, her voice a low, dangerous hum. She gestured with her chin towards the silent, winged statues. “Is that what you call Alistair Finch? A piece of your work?”

Elias Vance inclined his head, a gesture of gracious acknowledgement. “A preliminary sketch,” he corrected gently. “A study in imperfection. Professor Finch was a man who spoke of aesthetic purity, who wrote papers on the sublime beauty of the perfect form. He taught it. He lectured on it. But when he was shown its ultimate expression, he recoiled. He was a hypocrite, Detective. He talked of Icarus, but he was terrified of the sun. He preferred the safety of the earth.”

“So you killed him,” Sloan stated, cutting through his philosophical preamble with the blunt edge of fact. “You murdered him in his study because he gave you a bad review.”

A faint, pitying smile touched Elias’s lips. “You mistake a critique for a tantrum,” he said, his tone patient, as if explaining a complex theory to a child. “This wasn’t about my career. It was about his failure. He was presented with a chance to participate in a true act of aesthetic transcendence, and he chose to file a complaint with the university ethics committee. He tried to reduce my work to a disciplinary issue. He wanted to bury art under bureaucracy. I simply… edited his conclusion.”

Sloan took a slow step forward, her eyes scanning the workbench, the tools, the bags of feathers. The sheer, calm audacity of him was breathtaking. “Talk me through the edit, Elias. A locked room. A man found dead hours after he supposedly locked himself in. How did you manage that?”

For the first time, Elias looked genuinely pleased, like a magician whose prize trick has been acknowledged. “The beauty is in the simplicity, don’t you think? It’s all about an artist’s control over his medium. In this case, the medium was time.” He stood from his stool, his movements graceful, and began to walk slowly around his central sculpture. “Alistair was a man of unyielding routine. He worked in his study from nine until one. At one, he would leave for lunch, setting the house alarm as he went. The cleaner had her own key and code, but she was under strict instructions never to arrive before two, so as not to disturb him.”

He paused, turning to face them. “I arrived at half-past eight, before he went into his study. We had a scheduled meeting. I brought him a coffee. He invited me in. We talked. I presented him with my final argument, my… manifesto. He rejected it. Vehemently.” Elias’s serene expression tightened for just a fraction of a second. “So, at five minutes to nine, I killed him. A quick, precise application. A sharpened carbon-fibre sculpting rod. Very little mess.” He gestured to his temple, indicating the spot. “Then, I had four hours. The morning was my canvas.”

Miller let out an involuntary, choked sound. Sloan’s blood ran cold. He hadn’t broken in. He had been a guest. “You created the scene, the circle of feathers, and then what?” she pressed, keeping her voice steady.

“And then, I waited,” Elias said, a note of triumph in his voice. “I sat in his armchair, reading his books, until one o’clock had passed. Then I let myself out of the front door, set the alarm using his own code—he was foolishly predictable—and locked the door behind me. To the cleaner, to you, to the world, it would appear that Alistair Finch had locked himself in his study for the morning, as he always did. The timeline was my greatest sculpture. I didn’t break into a locked room, Detective. I created one.”

It was brilliant, arrogant, and utterly sociopathic. He had used the victim’s own life as the scaffolding for his crime. “And the feathers?” Sloan asked, her voice barely a whisper. “What was the point of the feathers?”

“Ah,” Elias breathed, his eyes shining. He gestured to the note on Finch’s phone. “As the note said: *They are not for flight, but for the fall*. It is the most vital part of the Icarus myth. Not the ascent, but the spectacular, beautiful failure. The moment of hubris meeting reality. Finch flew too close to my philosophy, then tried to retreat to the safety of his tenure and his tweed jackets. I merely gave his fall the aesthetic dignity it deserved. I gave him his wings.” He smiled again, a beatific, chilling expression. “Unlike my uncle, I am not interested in the beauty of decay. I am interested in the beauty of the perfect, final moment. The fall. The stillness. The end of the struggle. My art is about peace.”

Sloan had heard enough. The philosophical justifications, the self-aggrandizing pronouncements, it was all just noise wrapped around the cold, simple truth of a murder. “Elias Vance,” she said, her voice hard and clear, stripped of all pretence of conversation. “I am arresting you for the murder of Alistair Finch. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.” She gave a curt nod to Miller, who finally seemed to break from his stupor, producing a set of handcuffs.

Elias did not resist. He did not protest. He simply held out his wrists, a look of calm, almost beatific acceptance on his face. As Miller secured the cuffs, Elias’s gaze met Sloan’s. “It is finished,” he said softly. “The work is complete. Now it can be seen. Judged. Understood.” He looked around his gallery of white, winged figures, his expression not one of regret, but of profound, artistic satisfaction. He had created his masterpiece, and his arrest was merely its unveiling. As they led him from the studio, past the silent, beautiful angels he had created, Sloan knew that she wasn't just arresting a killer. She was taking a monster from his pedestal, a monster who believed, with every fibre of his being, that he had already flown to the sun and returned unscathed.The walk from the attic studio to the waiting police car was Elias Vance’s final exhibition, and he played his part to perfection. As Sloan and Miller escorted him through the long corridors of the art school, doors creaked open and students, their faces smudged with charcoal and clay, peered out. Their expressions were a mixture of confusion, shock, and a dawning, horrified recognition. They saw one of their own, a prodigy, being led away in handcuffs, yet Elias met their gazes not with shame, but with a serene, knowing smile. He was not a fallen man; he was a sculpture being moved for installation. He held his head high, his posture immaculate, turning the drab institutional hallway into his personal gallery runway. Sloan felt a profound sense of revulsion. She was not a police officer arresting a killer; she was an unwilling curator, forced to facilitate the public unveiling of a monster who saw his own infamy as the frame for his art.

The interview suite at Hanley station was the antithesis of everything Elias Vance held dear. It was a small, windowless box painted a shade of bureaucratic grey that managed to be both bland and oppressive. The air smelled of stale coffee and disinfectant. The table was bolted to the floor, its surface scarred with the bored graffiti of a hundred previous occupants. It was a room designed to strip a person of all artifice, to reduce them to the bare, ugly facts of their file. Elias sat opposite Sloan, his cuffed hands resting on the table, and yet he seemed utterly unaffected by the squalor. He looked at the scuffed grey walls as if they were a bold minimalist statement he was considering for a future piece. Sloan deliberately spread her files on the table between them—crime scene photos, preliminary forensic reports, a printed copy of his thesis. It was an invasion of hard, messy reality into his clean, abstract world.

“The recording has started,” Sloan said, her voice flat. “For the record, your name is Elias Vance. Is that correct?” Elias gave a slight, formal nod. “I am Elias Vance,” he confirmed, his tone as clear and steady as it had been in his studio. “And you, I believe, are the Detective Inspector who apprehended my uncle. It seems our family has a peculiar aptitude for attracting your professional attention.” The comment was delivered without a hint of malice, a simple statement of fact that was somehow more chilling than any threat. Sloan ignored the bait. “We’re here to talk about the murder of Alistair Finch.” Elias smiled faintly. “I would prefer to call it the completion of Alistair Finch. Murder is such a crude term. It speaks only of the ending, not the transformation.”

Sloan leaned forward, her voice dropping to a low, intense register. “There was no transformation, Elias. There was a man, drinking a coffee you brought him. And then there was a body, lying on a rug with a hole in its head. Let’s talk about the mechanics of that, not the philosophy. Let’s talk about the sculpting rod you sharpened. The four hours you sat in a dead man’s house. The way you used his own alarm code to seal his tomb. That isn’t art. It’s a cold, pre-meditated execution.” She slid a crime scene photograph across the table. It was a close-up of Finch’s head, the small, neat wound a dark mar on his pale skin. “Show me the aesthetic in that, Elias. Show me the perfect form.”

He glanced at the photograph with a flicker of distaste, the way a connoisseur might look at a clumsy forgery. “You insist on focusing on the canvas, Detective, rather than the painting. The physical act is merely the brushstroke. It is the intent, the final image, that constitutes the art. The stillness I gave him was a far more perfect state than the anxious, compromised existence he was living. I freed him from the hypocrisy of his own life.” He looked up from the photo, his eyes locking with hers, his gaze unwavering. “You cannot understand. You see only the blood and the feathers. I see the culmination of a classical ideal. You see a crime. I see a masterpiece.”

The sheer, unbreachable wall of his self-conviction was maddening. Sloan decided to change tactics, to knock him from his pedestal by reminding him he was not unique. “Your uncle also thought he was an artist,” she said, watching his face for any reaction. For the first time, the serene mask slipped. A flicker of deep, profound disdain crossed his features. “My uncle,” Elias said, the word dripping with contempt, “was a sentimentalist. A craftsman who mistook rage for vision. He was obsessed with dirt, with decay, with the past. He worked with mud and rust. His art was a primal scream of grievance. It was messy. It was emotional. It was, frankly, rather vulgar.” He leaned back in his chair, a smug sense of superiority radiating from him. “I am not interested in the grotesque. I am interested in the sublime. My work is about purity, light, transcendence. My uncle wanted to drag people down into the mud of the past. I want to give them wings for their final, perfect fall. Please, Detective, do not insult my intelligence by comparing my work to his.”### Chapter 7

The insult landed exactly as Sloan had intended, a precise, calculated blow to the fragile ego of a self-proclaimed genius. For all his posturing about the sublime, Elias Vance was still a man, and his pride was a raw, exposed nerve. She saw it in the tightening of his jaw, the almost imperceptible narrowing of his cold eyes. She had done more than compare him to his uncle; she had suggested he was merely a derivative, a more polished copy of a flawed original. She had denied him his most treasured possession: his uniqueness. Sloan pressed the advantage, her voice a low, insistent murmur that gave him no room to retreat into his philosophy.

“So this is just a family affair, then? A tradition passed down from uncle to nephew? He plays with mud, you play with plaster. He fetishizes decay, you fetishize perfection. But it’s the same disease, isn’t it, Elias? A sickness in the Vance blood that makes you think you have the right to turn people into objects for your own private gallery. You’re not a transcendent artist. You’re just the next broken man in a broken lineage.”

Elias leaned forward, the calm facade finally shattering, replaced by a searing, intellectual rage. His voice, when he spoke, had lost its melodic quality and was now a sharp, cutting whisper. “You understand nothing. My uncle was an abject failure. A pathetic creature who wallowed in filth and called it philosophy. His end was the most honest piece of art he ever produced: a screaming, blinded animal, smeared in his own crude medium, dragged away by men in uniforms. It was a failure of nerve, of planning, of aesthetics. He became the very thing he claimed to despise—a chaotic, messy, mortal man. He didn’t control his narrative; he was consumed by it.”

The depth of his revulsion for his own family was a chasm. Sloan realised this wasn’t just a professional disagreement; it was a fundamental rejection of his own blood, his own past. “So you decided to do it better? A cleaner crime, a tidier motive? You visited him, didn’t you? In the hospital.” It was a guess, but one grounded in the toxic psychology of rivalry. To truly believe yourself superior, you must first study the failure you intend to surpass.

Elias’s lips curled into a sneer of disgust. “I observed the specimen, yes. Once. He sat in a grey room, staring at a grey wall, his mind as empty and ruined as the factories he loved. There was no vision left, no art. Just a hollowed-out man medicated into oblivion. I saw his legacy: a folder in a police archive and a lifetime of supervised care. That is not an artist’s ending. It is a clerical error. I decided then that my work, my *real* work, would have a final act worthy of its ambition. A controlled, elegant, and definitive conclusion.”

The pieces clicked into place with a horrifying clarity. This wasn’t just about Finch. This was Elias’s grand finale. His own capture was not a failure, but a calculated part of the performance. He had intended to be caught. He wanted his sterile studio to be found, his winged statues to be photographed, his philosophy to be recorded and analysed. He hadn't been outmanoeuvred; he had simply moved to the next stage of his exhibition. He hadn't lost. In his own mind, he had won completely. He had created a perfect, hermetically sealed story, from the initial crime to his own intellectualised confession. He was his own final, perfect sculpture.

Sloan felt a profound wave of nausea. There was nothing more she could extract from him. Every question she asked would only feed his monstrous ego, every challenge would be twisted into another opportunity for him to pontificate. She had his confession, she understood his twisted logic, and she had seen the abyss that passed for his soul. She stood up abruptly, the scrape of her chair a harsh, ugly sound in the quiet room. “The interview is terminated,” she said, her voice devoid of any emotion. She didn't look at him again as she walked out, leaving him alone in the grey box, the perfect frame for his perfect, empty victory.

She found Miller in the corridor, leaning against the wall, his face pale. He had been listening through the speaker. He looked at her, his eyes wide with a question he couldn’t seem to articulate. “How?” was all he managed to say. Sloan ran a hand through her hair, the weariness she felt so total it was a physical weight. “I don’t know, Miller,” she admitted, her voice low. “One worshipped the city’s rot, the other worshipped a surgeon’s scalpel. One screamed, the other lectured. Julian Vance was a man driven mad by what the city had lost. Elias was driven mad by what he thought it could never be: perfect. They’re two sides of the same insane coin, minted from the same dark metal.”

The drive home that evening felt different. The familiar streets of Stoke-on-Trent, caught in the amber glow of the streetlights, seemed haunted by the warring philosophies of the two killers she had caged. She saw Julian Vance in the crumbling facades of the abandoned potbanks, in the graffiti that bloomed like strange flora on derelict walls. She saw Elias in the sharp, clean lines of a new office building, in the sterile perfection of a manicured suburban lawn, in the blank, white faces of the mannequins in a department store window. The entire city felt like a battleground between the messy, chaotic truth of human life and the cold, inhuman pursuit of an impossible ideal.

When she got back to her house, the silence within was no longer a comfort, but a void. She walked into her small living room and her eyes fell on a spiderweb, strung with almost architectural precision in the corner of the ceiling. A week ago, she would have seen it as another job to be done, a small pocket of domestic failure. But now, she saw the spider, a tiny, dark speck, patiently waiting at its centre. It was a small, living thing, creating its own intricate, imperfect world in a forgotten corner. It was messy. It was real. It was everything Elias Vance, in his pursuit of sterile beauty, would have despised. Sloan left it there. It was a quiet act of defiance, a vote for the complicated, untidy, and persistent business of life itself.The insult landed exactly as Sloan had intended, a precise, calculated blow to the fragile ego of a self-proclaimed genius. For all his posturing about the sublime, Elias Vance was still a man, and his pride was a raw, exposed nerve.

It is a clerical error. I decided then that my work, my *real* work, would have a final act worthy of its ambition. A controlled, elegant, and definitive conclusion.”

The pieces clicked into place with a horrifying clarity. This wasn’t just about Finch. This was Elias’s grand finale. His own capture was not a failure, but a calculated part of the performance. He had intended to be caught. He wanted his sterile studio to be found, his winged statues to be photographed, his philosophy to be recorded and analysed. He hadn't been outmanoeuvred; he had simply moved to the next stage of his exhibition. He hadn't lost. In his own mind, he had won completely. He had created a perfect, hermetically sealed story, from the initial crime to his own intellectualised confession. He was his own final, perfect sculpture.

Sloan felt a profound wave of nausea. There was nothing more she could extract from him. Every question she asked would only feed his monstrous ego, every challenge would be twisted into another opportunity for him to pontificate. She had his confession, she understood his twisted logic, and she had seen the abyss that passed for his soul. She stood up abruptly, the scrape of her chair a harsh, ugly sound in the quiet room. “The interview is terminated,” she said, her voice devoid of any emotion. She didn't look at him again as she walked out, leaving him alone in the grey box, the perfect frame for his perfect, empty victory.

She found Miller in the corridor, leaning against the wall, his face pale. He had been listening through the speaker. He looked at her, his eyes wide with a question he couldn’t seem to articulate. “How?” was all he managed to say. Sloan ran a hand through her hair, the weariness she felt so total it was a physical weight. “I don’t know, Miller,” she admitted, her voice low. “One worshipped the city’s rot, the other worshipped a surgeon’s scalpel. One screamed, the other lectured. Julian Vance was a man driven mad by what the city had lost. Elias was driven mad by what he thought it could never be: perfect. They’re two sides of the same insane coin, minted from the same dark metal.”

The drive home that evening felt different. The familiar streets of Stoke-on-Trent, caught in the amber glow of the streetlights, seemed haunted by the warring philosophies of the two killers she had caged. She saw Julian Vance in the crumbling facades of the abandoned potbanks, in the graffiti that bloomed like strange flora on derelict walls. She saw Elias in the sharp, clean lines of a new office building, in the sterile perfection of a manicured suburban lawn, in the blank, white faces of the mannequins in a department store window. The entire city felt like a battleground between the messy, chaotic truth of human life and the cold, inhuman pursuit of an impossible ideal.

When she got back to her house, the silence within was no longer a comfort, but a void. She walked into her small living room and her eyes fell on a spiderweb, strung with almost architectural precision in the corner of the ceiling. A week ago, she would have seen it as another job to be done, a small pocket of domestic failure. But now, she saw the spider, a tiny, dark speck, patiently waiting at its centre. It was a small, living thing, creating its own intricate, imperfect world in a forgotten corner. It was messy. It was real. It was everything Elias Vance, in his pursuit of sterile beauty, would have despised. Sloan left it there. It was a quiet act of defiance, a vote for the complicated, untidy, and persistent business of life itself.### Chapter 8

The public’s memory, Sloan had always thought, was a shallow grave. But Elias Vance refused to be buried. Julian, ‘The Curator’, had been a ghoul, a figure of grim, industrial horror who was quickly mythologised and then filed away as a local nightmare. Elias, however, was different. The press, with their insatiable appetite for a compelling narrative, dubbed him ‘The Icarus Killer’. His youth, his chilling articulation, and above all, the haunting, terrible beauty of his feathered sculptures made him a subject of endless fascination. Sunday supplements ran long, speculative think-pieces penned by art critics and pop psychologists. They analysed his ‘Hellenic Period’, debated his ‘philosophy of the fall’, and printed glossy, full-page photographs of his white-winged statues, which had been seized as evidence and now sat under tarpaulins in a secure police lock-up. Elias Vance had not been erased by his capture; he had been curated by it, his infamy a global exhibition he had orchestrated from a prison cell.

In the incident room, the clean-up from the Icarus case felt more like a public relations exercise than a police procedure. Superintendent Davies was perpetually on the phone with someone from the Home Office or the Chief Constable’s office, his voice a low, urgent murmur of damage control and strategic leaking. The case was no longer a local murder; it was a national phenomenon, and every piece of paperwork was scrutinised for its potential to become a headline. Sloan found herself adrift in the middle of it, a reluctant custodian of a story she no longer controlled. She wrote her reports in stark, declarative sentences, refusing to use the jargon of the press or the psychologists. Alistair Finch had been murdered. The weapon was a sharpened rod. The motive was a monstrous, narcissistic rage dressed up as philosophy. To her, it was that simple, and the endless analysis felt like a second violation.

She was signing off on the final evidence logs when Miller approached her desk, a thin file in his hand. His face was set in a familiar expression of grim resignation. “The initial psychiatric report on Elias Vance, ma’am,” he said, placing it on her desk. “Came through this morning.” Sloan flicked it open, her eyes scanning the neat columns of clinical terminology. ‘Grandiose messianic complex.’ ‘Pronounced schizoid and narcissistic traits.’ ‘Lack of affective empathy consistent with sociopathy.’ The words were a sterile, academic vocabulary for the abyss she had looked into. They were labels for a jar, giving no sense of the poison contained within. “It says he’s sane, then,” she summarised, her voice flat. “Sane enough to stand trial and enjoy his celebrity.” Miller nodded. “They think he’ll plead not guilty by reason of artistic necessity, or some such nonsense. His solicitor is already lining up expert witnesses to testify about his ‘vision’.” Sloan closed the file with a snap. The justice system, with its rules and procedures, felt like a pathetic toolkit for dealing with a man like Elias. He would turn his own trial into performance art, the witness box his final podium.

That afternoon, a thought that had been circling in the back of her mind for days finally landed. It was a reckless, unorthodox idea, a flagrant breach of the clean lines that were supposed to separate one case from the next. She needed to close the circle. She needed to understand the root. She stood up, grabbing her car keys. “I’m going out, Miller,” she said, not looking at him. “A follow-up on an old case.” He didn't ask which one. He didn’t need to. He simply watched her go, a worried frown creasing his brow. Her drive took her north, away from the city centre, towards the sprawling, modern campus of the region’s largest secure psychiatric hospital. It was a place of long, low buildings surrounded by high fences, a facility designed with a chilling, functional anonymity. It was where the Curator now resided.

The process of gaining entry was a bureaucratic ordeal of permissions and security checks, but her rank and the lingering notoriety of the Vance name eventually cut through the red tape. She was escorted down a series of long, unnervingly quiet corridors that smelled of bleach and medication. The floors were polished to a high shine, the walls painted a calming, therapeutic shade of green. It was the architectural opposite of everything Julian Vance had ever revered. Finally, she was shown into a small, bare room, furnished with two plastic chairs and a table bolted to the floor. A pane of reinforced glass looked out onto a small, manicured courtyard where a few patients walked in slow, medicated circles. A few minutes later, the door opened and Julian Vance was led in by two burly orderlies.

The change in him was shocking. The wild, frantic energy, the burning rage that had radiated from him in the kiln yard, was gone. His eyes, once incandescent with zealotry, were now dull and flat, the fire extinguished by a cocktail of antipsychotics. He was thinner, and his skin had a pale, indoor quality. He wore a standard-issue grey tracksuit, a cruel parody of the colour he had once weaponised. He shuffled to the chair opposite her and sat down, his movements slow and disconnected. He didn’t seem to recognise her. “Julian,” she said, her voice even. “I’m DI Sloan. We met before.” He stared at the table, his expression blank. The orderlies stood by the door, their arms crossed. Sloan pushed on, knowing she had limited time. “I’m not here about your case. I’m here about your nephew. Elias.”

At the name, something flickered deep in the vacant pools of his eyes. A spark of memory, of connection. He slowly raised his head, his gaze finally meeting hers. “The boy,” he rasped, his voice a dry, unused thing. “The boy who liked the clean things.” Sloan nodded. “He’s been arrested, Julian. For murder. He killed his university professor.” She watched his face, searching for any sign of shock, of grief, of family loyalty. There was nothing. Only a slow, dawning focus, as if a switch had been flipped somewhere deep inside his medicated brain. “He used plaster,” Julian continued, his voice gaining a little more strength, a little more of its old, gravelly texture. “White. And feathers. Like a bird.” He wasn’t asking; he was stating a fact. The news had penetrated even these thick, sound-proofed walls.

“He calls it his art,” Sloan said. “He thinks it’s beautiful. Perfect.” A strange sound escaped Julian’s lips. It took Sloan a moment to identify it as a laugh, a dry, rattling cough of pure, undiluted contempt. “Perfect?” he scoffed, the word a piece of filth in his mouth. “There is no perfection. There is only truth. The truth of rust. The truth of rain on brick. The truth of decay.” He leaned forward, the sudden intensity in his posture making the orderlies shift their weight. His eyes were no longer dull; they were burning with a familiar, righteous fury. “He learned nothing. Nothing! He looked at the city, at my work, and all he saw was the surface. He wanted to wipe it clean, make it white, sterile. He is no better than the developers with their bulldozers. He is just another sanitiser.” He spat the final word out. He didn’t see Elias as a successor, or even a rival. He saw him as a heretic, a traitor to the one true faith of decay. He saw him as the enemy. Sloan sat back, a cold, terrible understanding washing over her. The Vance sickness wasn’t a single disease. It was a schism, a holy war fought with murder and madness, a battle between two prophets of the same apocalypse, each one convinced that they alone held the key to its terrible beauty. The city wasn’t their canvas; it was their scripture, and they were each writing their own dark, bloody gospel in its margins.The drive back from the secure hospital was a journey through a landscape that had been re-contextualised. Every crumbling wall was a testament to Julian’s faith, every sleek glass-fronted new building a monument to Elias’s. The city was no longer just a place; it was an argument, a bitter theological dispute being waged in brick and steel. Sloan felt like the sole reader of a secret, terrible text, a history of madness written in the very layout of the streets she patrolled. The Vance family had not simply committed murders; they had infected the very way she saw the world. They had given her the curse of their vision, and she knew it was a stain that would never fully wash out.

Back in the clamour of the station, the mundane felt like a lifeline. Phones rang with reports of stolen handbags and pub fights. The noise was blessedly free of philosophy. Miller was waiting by her desk, his expression a mixture of concern and professional curiosity. “Ma’am? Everything alright?” She waved a dismissive hand, sinking into her chair, the institutional fabric a poor comfort. “Just tying up a loose end.” She offered no other explanation, and he was wise enough not to press for one. The gulf that had opened between her and the rest of the world during these cases felt wider than ever. They had dealt with the crimes; she was still wrestling with the theology. “Elias Vance’s trial date has been set,” Miller offered, changing the subject. “Six weeks’ time. The CPS are confident. A full-life tariff is almost certain.” Sloan nodded, the information landing with a strange lack of impact. Caging Elias felt less like a victory and more like placing a particularly toxic sculpture into storage. The man was already gone, replaced by the myth he had so carefully constructed. The court case would just be its official installation.

She spent the rest of the afternoon staring at the case files, not reading them, but seeing through them. She saw the photograph of Leo Massey's bedroom, his walls covered in his dark, passionate drawings of the city’s ruins. He hadn’t been a prophet of decay like Julian, or a zealot of perfection like Elias. He had been an observer, a lover of the world as it was, in all its messy, melancholic, imperfect glory. He was the innocent caught in the crossfire of their holy war, a boy who simply saw beauty, and was destroyed for it. The thought spurred her into action. There was one final piece of police work to be done, one that wouldn’t appear in any official report. She began to carefully catalogue the sketches and sketchbooks that had been taken from Leo's room as evidence, marking all but the single drawing of the Curator for release.

A few days later, she found herself standing on Jean Massey’s doorstep for the second time. She wasn’t carrying a warrant or bad news, but two large, flat evidence boxes. Jean opened the door, her face still shadowed by a grief that had become a permanent part of her features, but the raw, gaping shock had been replaced by a quiet, settled sadness. She looked at Sloan with a kind of weary recognition. “Inspector,” she said, her voice soft. Sloan held up the boxes. “I’m not here as a police officer, Mrs Massey. The case is closed. This is… a return of property.” Jean led her into the small, quiet living room. Sloan placed the boxes on the coffee table and carefully lifted the lids. Inside, nestled in protective acid-free paper, were Leo’s sketchbooks, his loose drawings, his charcoal sticks, and his art college portfolio. It was the sum of his short, brilliant artistic life.

“I know it’s just… stuff,” Sloan began, her voice awkward, the words feeling inadequate. “But it’s his. His voice. Julian and Elias Vance, they tried to twist it, to make it part of their own horrible stories. But it isn't. It's just Leo’s.” She picked up one of the sketchbooks and handed it to Jean. “They saw the city as something to be either worshipped or erased. Leo just saw it. He saw it all. And he found a way to make it beautiful.” Jean took the sketchbook, her small hands tracing the scuffed cover. She opened it to a random page, a detailed, loving drawing of a rusting canal barge half-sunk in the water, weeds growing through its deck. A tear she didn't wipe away fell onto the page, a small, dark spot on the heavy paper. “He would spend hours,” she whispered, a ghost of a smile touching her lips. “Just sitting. Watching. He said the world was full of stories, if you just looked close enough.” She looked up at Sloan, her eyes clear for the first time. “Thank you,” she said, the words simple but imbued with a profound weight. “Thank you for bringing him home.”

Driving away from the small terraced house, Sloan felt a quiet sense of release, a feeling that had been absent for months. It wasn’t victory, and it wasn’t closure—that was a myth sold in newspapers. It was simply the feeling of having done one small, correct thing in a world full of profound wrongs. She had taken a piece of a life that had been stolen and turned into evidence, and she had given it back to the person who understood its true value. She hadn't defeated the monsters, but she had rescued one of their relics from their dark museum and returned it to the light.

That evening, in her own house, the silence felt different again. It was no longer a void, but a space. The house was quiet, the u-bend was fixed, but the dust was gathering on the mantelpiece and the spider in the corner had completed its intricate, flawed masterpiece. Life was messy. It was imperfect. It was a constant, ongoing process of things breaking and being mended, of beauty being found in the most unexpected corners. It was a truth her city knew in its very bones. As she stood in her living room, Sloan understood that her job was not to impose order on this chaos, but to simply stand as a barrier against those who would try to burn it all down or freeze it all in place. She was a caretaker, not a curator. And for the first time in a long time, that felt like enough.The public’s memory, Sloan had always thought, was a shallow grave. But Elias Vance refused to be buried. Julian, ‘The Curator’, had been a ghoul, a figure of grim, industrial horror who was quickly mythologised and then filed away as a local nightmare. Elias, however, was different. The press, with their insatiable appetite for a compelling narrative, dubbed him ‘The Icarus Killer’.

It was a schism, a holy war fought with murder and madness, a battle between two prophets of the same apocalypse, each one convinced that they alone held the key to its terrible beauty. The city wasn’t their canvas; it was their scripture, and they were each writing their own dark, bloody gospel in its margins.### Chapter 9

Winter arrived not as a gentle frosting, but as a hard, iron-grey clamp on the city. The days were short, the nights long, and a persistent, chilling damp seeped into the brickwork, making the old houses feel their age. At the station in Hanley, the central heating fought a losing battle, and the air was thick with the scent of wet coats and the low-level grumbling of a police force bogged down in the dreary preamble to Christmas. For DI Sloan, the routine was a kind of solace. She immersed herself in the messy, human chaos of domestic disputes and a rash of joyless burglaries targeting garden sheds. These were crimes born of desperation or stupidity, their motives as transparent and grubby as a pawnbroker’s window. They were problems she could understand, knots she could untangle with procedure and a bit of legwork. But on the corner of her desk, a single date was circled in red on her calendar, a stark reminder that the season of mundane crime was about to be interrupted by a final, formal act of madness: the trial of Elias Vance.

The morning of the trial, the area around Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was a circus. Media vans with satellite dishes bristling from their roofs lined the street like expectant vultures. A crowd of onlookers, their breath pluming in the frigid air, pressed against the police barriers, their faces a mixture of morbid curiosity and grim excitement. This was not justice; it was a ticketed event. Inside, the courthouse was a cathedral of wood panelling and hushed, formal procedure, but the atmosphere was electric with the same voyeuristic tension. Sloan, sitting on a hard bench waiting to be called, felt a profound sense of dislocation. She was here as the primary witness for the prosecution, the officer who had taken the confession, but she felt more like a historical artefact being wheeled out for display, a piece of evidence in someone else’s exhibition.

When her time came, she walked to the witness box with a steady, determined stride, her eyes fixed on the prosecuting barrister. She took the oath, her voice clear and strong in the cavernous room. Under the QC’s careful guidance, she laid out the facts of the case, her testimony a stark, brutalist architecture of timelines, evidence logs, and direct quotes. She spoke of the locked room, the sculpting rod, the bags of feathers, the alarm code. She recounted Elias’s confession without inflection, her voice a flat, procedural monotone that deliberately stripped his words of their philosophical grandeur, reducing them to the ugly boasts of a killer. When the defence barrister rose to cross-examine, a sharp-suited man with an artfully sympathetic expression, he tried repeatedly to draw her into a discussion of Elias’s ‘vision’. “Detective Inspector,” he purred, “would you agree that the scene you discovered, while tragic, had a certain… aesthetic quality? A deliberate arrangement?” Sloan met his gaze without blinking. “I would agree it was a pre-meditated and staged crime scene, designed by the killer to terrorise and confuse.” The barrister tried again, but she would not be moved. She refused to use his language, refused to play on his stage. Her testimony was an act of rebellion, a small, stubborn insistence on the primacy of the murder over the myth.

Elias Vance himself was a study in serene arrogance. Seated in the reinforced glass of the dock, he was not a defendant, but a visiting lecturer. He wore a simple, dark, well-cut suit, and his expression was one of calm, intellectual curiosity, as if he were observing a fascinating, if slightly primitive, tribal ritual. When he eventually took the stand, against his counsel’s advice, he did not speak to the jury. He delivered a sermon. He spoke of the classical ideals of beauty and form, of the sublime moment of the fall, of the artist’s duty to elevate the mundane to the level of the mythic. He recast the murder of Alistair Finch not as a crime, but as a necessary, collaborative act. “Professor Finch gave his life to his art,” Elias concluded, his soft voice filling the silent courtroom. “I simply facilitated the final installation.” He was magnificent, chilling, and utterly insane, and the press gallery scribbled down every last, poisonous word.

Sloan had stopped listening. Her attention had been drawn to the public gallery, to a small, solitary figure sitting in the back row, almost hidden from view. It was Jean Massey. She was clutching a worn handbag in her lap, her posture ramrod straight, her presence a silent, powerful rebuke to the entire proceeding. She was not there for the spectacle, or the philosophy, or the verdict. She was there as a witness for the forgotten, a representative for the boy whose name had barely been mentioned, the first victim whose murder had been relegated to a footnote in the story of his killer. As Sloan watched, Jean raised her head, and their eyes met across the vast, wood-panelled space. In that silent, shared glance, the entire artifice of the courtroom collapsed. The legal arguments, the psychiatric jargon, the sensationalist headlines—it all dissolved, stripped away by the simple, unbearable weight of a mother’s grief. This, Sloan thought, a cold certainty settling in her soul. This is the only truth in this room.

When the court adjourned for the day, Sloan pushed her way through the throng, ignoring the shouted questions from reporters. The cold winter air hit her like a physical blow, clean and sharp after the stale, theatrical atmosphere inside. She saw Miller waiting for her by the steps, a flask of what she hoped was coffee in his hand, his face etched with a familiar concern. She took the offered cup, the warmth a small, grounding comfort. She felt hollowed out, consumed by a sense of profound futility. The law would do its work. Elias would be caged, his name would become a synonym for a certain kind of clever, articulate evil, and the world would move on. But the trial felt like a grotesque parody of justice. It was a process designed to contain a monster, but in doing so, it had given him his grandest stage and his loudest microphone. It had validated his belief that his life, his crimes, were a story worthy of an audience.

That night, back in the quiet sanctuary of her own home, Sloan stood for a long time by the window, looking out at the familiar, rain-slicked street. The spiderweb in the corner of her living room was gone now, cleared away in a fit of cleaning weeks ago. She found herself missing it. It had been a small, private testament to the messy, tenacious, and often invisible work of creation. Unlike Elias, the spider had sought no audience. It had simply done its work, built its intricate, imperfect home, and moved on. The world was full of such quiet, persistent acts of living and dying, of building and breaking. This was the world she was paid to protect. The courts, the press, the public—they could have the story of Elias Vance. It was just another ghost story, a tale told to ward off the darkness. She knew the real work lay here, in the quiet houses and the grey streets, in the space between the headlines, where the real, untidy, and precious business of life went on.The verdict, when it came two days later, was a formality delivered with the solemn weight of inevitability. The jury, a panel of twelve ordinary citizens who had been forced to stare into the abyss of Elias Vance’s psyche, returned after less than an hour of deliberation. The foreman, a tired-looking man in a rumpled suit, stood and delivered the word ‘Guilty’ in a voice that was barely a whisper, yet it resounded through the silent courtroom like a hammer blow. A ripple of movement went through the press gallery, a rustle of notebooks and a flurry of surreptitious texting. In the public gallery, a single, sharp sob was quickly stifled. Sloan, standing near the back of the court, felt nothing. Not triumph, not relief, just a profound and hollow emptiness. The machine had completed its function. The box had been ticked.

She watched Elias. He listened to the word that condemned him to a lifetime in a cage, and a slow, beatific smile spread across his face. He nodded once, a gesture of magnanimous approval, as if the jury had just awarded him a prestigious prize. He had won. His performance had been understood, his thesis proven. His name would now be etched into the annals of criminal history, his story told and retold, his face a permanent fixture in the dark museum of public fascination. He had achieved the immortality he craved. As he was led from the dock, he cast one last look over the courtroom, his eyes sweeping across the jury, the press, and the public, the look of an artist surveying a successful opening night, before he disappeared from view.

Outside, the dam of media restraint broke. Microphones were thrust into the faces of the barristers, and camera flashes strobed in the weak winter sunlight. Superintendent Davies, his face glowing with a triumphant, professional satisfaction, delivered a prepared statement about justice being served and the community being safe once more. Sloan pushed past it all, a ghost at the feast, her ears ringing with the meaningless noise. She saw Jean Massey being shielded by a family liaison officer, her face a mask of dignified, impenetrable grief, as she was guided towards a waiting car. Her war was over, but there would be no victory parade.

Miller caught up with her as she reached her car, his own face alight with a simpler, purer emotion. “We got him, ma’am,” he said, a grin spreading across his face. “A full-life tariff, the CPS are certain. He’ll never see the outside of a prison again.” He was vibrating with the righteous energy of a job well and truly done, and for a moment, Sloan envied him his clarity. “Good work, Miller,” she said, the words feeling inadequate. She unlocked her car, the need to escape the suffocating atmosphere of the court a physical imperative. “You earned yourself a pint. Or several.” Miller’s grin faltered slightly as he registered her tone, the sheer absence of celebration in her voice. “Aren’t you coming, ma’am?” he asked. Sloan shook her head, a wry, tired smile touching her lips. “Someone has to write the overtime reports, Miller.” It was a lie, but it was the only excuse she could muster. She left him there on the pavement, a good detective celebrating a clear-cut victory, while she drove away, back into the grey, complicated world where nothing was ever that simple.

She didn’t go back to the station. On impulse, she drove west, towards the canal, not to the towpath in Shelton where Leo had been found, but further out, to a quieter, more forgotten stretch where the waterway ran alongside fields and skeletal winter trees. She parked the car and walked, the cold air a bracing shock to her system. The water was black and still, reflecting the low, heavy sky like a dark mirror. A discarded shopping trolley lay half-submerged near the bank, its metal frame furred with green algae. A piece of blue plastic sheeting was snagged in the bare branches of a hawthorn bush, fluttering in the breeze like a captured flag. It was a scene of mundane neglect, a landscape of casual, uncurated decay. It was Julian Vance’s paradise.

She stopped, looking at the scene, trying to see it through his eyes, then through Elias’s. One would have seen the rust and the rot as a sacred text. The other would have seen only an imperfection to be scrubbed clean, a flaw in the landscape that needed to be erased or transformed into a cold, white ideal. They were both blind. They saw their own obsessions reflected back at them, but they never saw the thing itself. Then, her gaze fell on a small patch of moss growing in a crack on the stone towpath. It was a patch of vibrant, impossible green against the damp, grey stone. Within it, a tiny, determined daisy, no bigger than her thumbnail, had pushed its way through, its white petals stark against the green. It was flawed, fragile, and utterly out of place. It served no purpose. It was not a statement, or a monument, or a symbol of anything other than its own stubborn, foolish, beautiful insistence on living. It was Leo Massey’s kind of art. Sloan crouched down, her fingers brushing against the cold, damp stone. The wind whispered through the skeletal trees, carrying with it the distant hum of the city. A premonition, ugly and sharp. A different premonition, one that she had now. The one she’d had a few weeks ago was a memory that would stay with her, but it no longer felt like a part of her. A typical Tuesday. That’s how she’d once thought of her days, but she knew that could never be the case again.### Chapter 10

Spring came to Stoke-on-Trent not as a vibrant explosion, but as a slow, cautious negotiation. The hard grey of winter softened at the edges, and a tentative green began to fuzz the railway embankments and the forgotten corners of the potbanks. In the city’s parks, crocuses pushed through the cold soil like small, defiant acts of optimism. For DI Sloan, the changing of the seasons brought a return to a rhythm she had almost forgotten, the familiar cadence of workaday policing. The spectres of Julian and Elias Vance had receded, their grand, terrible narratives replaced by the messy, incoherent prose of everyday crime: shopliftings, street-level drug deals, and the endless, wearying cycle of domestic violence. She worked the cases with a renewed, almost monastic focus, finding a strange comfort in their lack of philosophy. A stolen wallet was just a stolen wallet. It did not pretend to be a masterpiece.

She had settled into a new kind of equilibrium, a quiet truce with the ghosts of her city. The trial was a memory, a scar that had faded from a raw wound to a pale, silvery line. Elias Vance, from his high-security cell, had become the subject of a lurid documentary series, his chilling pronouncements now packaged for public consumption between commercial breaks. Julian Vance remained in his medicated twilight, a footnote in his nephew’s more spectacular story. The cases were closed, filed, and archived. The city, and the police force, had moved on. Sloan had tried to move on with them, immersing herself in the present, deliberately turning her back on the abyss that had opened up before her.

The call that shattered the fragile peace came on a bright, deceptively cheerful April afternoon. The drone of the office was a familiar counterpoint to the drone of her own thoughts as she compiled a report on a recent spate of copper thefts. The phone on her desk rang, and she answered it with the weary expectation of another minor catastrophe. It was DC Miller. His voice wasn’t taut with the high-wire tension of horror, but it was threaded with something else, a deep and unsettling bewilderment that she recognised as the overture to the truly strange.

“Ma’am. We’ve had a call to the old Grand Theatre in Hanley. The one that’s been derelict for twenty years. A couple of kids bunking off school broke in. They found… well, they found a man. The patrol car just confirmed it.”

“A rough sleeper?” Sloan asked, her pen hovering over the report. It was a common enough tragedy.

“No, ma’am,” Miller said, and a long pause followed. “He’s in a chair. On the stage. He’s been… arranged. And he’s watching something.”

The word ‘arranged’ was a key turning in a lock Sloan had hoped would remain permanently rusted shut. The casual mundanity of the afternoon evaporated, replaced by a cold, familiar dread. The Grand Theatre. A forgotten palace of entertainment, its ornate plasterwork crumbling to dust behind boarded-up doors. It was another of the city’s magnificent ruins, a place saturated with the ghosts of memory. The choice of venue was too deliberate, too theatrical. “On my way,” she said, her voice flatter than she intended. She hung up the phone, the copper theft report already forgotten. The truce was over. Another artist had opened a new exhibition.

The theatre was a grand, decaying dowager slumped between a cut-price carpet warehouse and a boarded-up pub. The garish colours of the police tape looked like a cheap, modern insult against its grimy Victorian brickwork. A small crowd of onlookers had already gathered, their faces turned upwards towards the building’s blind, boarded windows. Sloan badged the constable at the door, a grim-faced veteran who just shook his head as she passed. “In there, ma’am. It’s like something from a film.” The air inside was thick and cold, carrying the heavy, sweet scent of damp plaster, rotting velvet, and countless decades of dust. Her torch beam cut through the gloom, revealing a world of faded grandeur. The vast auditorium was a sea of shadows, the seats covered in ghostly white dust sheets, the gilded paint on the proscenium arch peeling away to reveal the bare plaster beneath.

Miller was waiting for her at the edge of the orchestra pit, his lanky frame silhouetted against the faint light filtering in from a high, grime-caked window. He didn’t say a word, just pointed towards the stage. Sloan stepped over a tangle of fallen cables and climbed the short set of steps onto the vast, dusty stage. And there he was. He was an elderly man, dressed in a smart, if slightly old-fashioned, suit and tie. He was sitting bolt upright in a single, solitary theatre seat that had been placed in the exact centre of the stage. His hands were folded neatly in his lap, and his head was tilted slightly, as if in rapt attention. He was facing the back of the stage, away from the empty auditorium. In front of him, on the crumbling back wall, a film was playing.

It was an old, silent, black-and-white movie, projected onto the wall from a vintage 8mm projector that sat on a small table beside him, whirring away with a soft, hypnotic clatter. The film was grainy and flickered badly, showing scenes of Stoke-on-Trent from what looked like the 1950s or 60s. It showed bustling crowds on market day, families enjoying the sunshine in Hanley Park, and workers pouring out of the gates of a potbank at the end of their shift. It was a film reel of ghosts, a city that no longer existed, a world of life and movement trapped in a silent, flickering loop. The man in the chair sat perfectly still, a silent audience for a silent past. His eyes were open, but they were glassy and unseeing. On his lap, resting on his folded hands, was a small, ornate, silver-plated ticket stub, the kind that hadn’t been used in half a century. It was an admission to a show that had ended long ago.Sloan crouched down, her knees protesting against the cold, dusty floorboards. The whirring of the projector was the only sound in the vast, dead space, a lonely mechanical heartbeat. She looked at the man’s face. He was old, perhaps in his late eighties, his skin thin and papery, mapped with the fine lines of a long life. His expression was one of calm, placid interest, as if he were genuinely enjoying the film. There was no sign of fear, no rictus of a final struggle. It was a terrible, peaceful serenity that was profoundly unnatural. She forced her gaze away from his face and down to the ticket stub resting in his lap. It was thick card, its silver coating tarnished with age. The lettering was ornate, beautifully printed. ‘GRAND THEATRE OF VARIETIES’. Below that, ‘Admit One’, and a seat number: Stalls, A1. The best seat in the house.

She stood and turned her attention to the flickering images on the wall. The film was a collage of lost moments. Children paddling in a lido that had long since been filled in and grassed over. Women in headscarves and men in flat caps laughing as they haggled over pottery seconds at a street market that no longer existed. A steam train pulling into Stoke station, belching a cloud of white smoke into a sky thick with the haze from a hundred bottle kilns. It was a potent, concentrated dose of nostalgia, a moving-picture postcard from a city that was now a ghost. The killer hadn’t just placed a body; they had curated an experience, a private screening for an audience of one. The act felt less like a desecration and more like a bizarre, deeply unsettling memorial.

“Get a team to start a full search of the building, every dressing room, every dusty corner,” Sloan said to Miller, her voice a low command that barely disturbed the dust motes dancing in the projector’s beam. “I want this film reel handled like it’s a Fabergé egg. Get it to the lab. I want to know its age, its provenance, if it’s a copy or an original. And start running this man’s description through Missing Persons. Elderly, well-dressed, probably local. Someone is missing him.” She looked back at the silent figure in the chair. “He didn’t walk in here and set this up for himself, Miller. Someone brought him here. Someone gave him his ticket.”

Dr Adebayo arrived looking more weary than usual, his large frame wrapped in a coat that seemed inadequate against the theatre’s cavernous chill. He surveyed the scene with a long, slow sweep of his eyes, his expression a familiar mixture of professional curiosity and profound cynicism. “Well, Sloan,” he rumbled, his voice echoing slightly in the vast space. “They’re certainly not getting any less dramatic, are they? First the artists, now the impresarios.” He knelt beside the body, his movements surprisingly deft, and gently lifted one of the man’s eyelids with a gloved thumb. He checked for lividity, felt for rigor. For a long time, the only sound was the clicking of the projector.

“There’s no obvious cause of death,” Adebayo said finally, standing up and brushing dust from the knees of his trousers. “No trauma, no signs of restraint that I can see. The peaceful expression is genuine, in a manner of speaking. His heart just… stopped.” He looked at Sloan, his dark eyes thoughtful. “But here’s the interesting part. Based on the temperature of the body and the established lividity, he’s been dead for at least eighteen to twenty-four hours. He didn’t die here, watching this film. He was brought here post-mortem. He was dead long before the show began.” The pathologist gestured towards the projector. “Whoever did this went to a great deal of trouble to arrange a screening for a man who was already gone. This isn't a murder scene, DI Sloan. It’s a wake.”

The information landed with a cold, heavy thud. The killer had transported a body, set up a vintage projector, and staged this entire tableau for… what? For the police to find? For their own satisfaction? The motive was infuriatingly opaque. The first piece of the puzzle came an hour later, as the forensics team were carefully dismantling the scene. Miller came jogging up the steps to the stage, a phone pressed to his ear. His face was pale. “Ma’am. We’ve got a potential ID,” he said, his voice tight. “Missing Persons report filed this morning by a concerned neighbour. An eighty-seven-year-old man from Basford. Didn’t put his milk bottles out. Name’s Arthur Pinner.” Miller took a deep breath. “According to the neighbour, Arthur worked his entire life at the Grand Theatre. He was the chief projectionist, right up until the day it closed.”

The connection was so perfect, so chillingly appropriate, that it felt like a punch to the gut. This wasn’t just a victim; he was a piece of casting. The killer had found the man whose job it was to project the city’s dreams and memories onto a screen, and had given him one final, private showing. The ticket stub wasn’t an admission for the victim; it was the killer’s signature, a statement of intent. This new monster wasn’t a Curator of decay or an Icarus of perfection. This was something else. A storyteller. A historian. A ghost-keeper. And Sloan knew, with a certainty that settled in her bones like the theatre’s deep, damp chill, that this was only the first reel.
