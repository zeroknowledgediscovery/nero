The scissors, gold-plated and needlessly ornate, felt cold in King Alistair’s gloved hand. Another ribbon. Another plaque. Another beige building that promised civic renewal but delivered only architectural tedium. This one was the Perth and Kinross Regional Distribution Hub, a name so profoundly uninspired it felt like a deliberate act of aggression against the very concept of poetry. He smiled, a precise muscular arrangement he had perfected over two decades of public life. It was a smile that conveyed mild, dignified interest. It revealed nothing of the howling void that had taken up residence behind his sternum.

“And so,” droned Provost Miller, his jowls quivering with self-importance, “with this ceremonial severing, we symbolically open not just a building, Your Majesty, but a new artery of commerce for our beloved Perth!”

Alistair’s smile tightened by a millimeter. A new artery of commerce. Lovely. He thought of the arteries in his own body, dutifully pumping blood to keep a man alive who increasingly felt like a museum exhibit. *King Alistair IV, in his natural habitat. Observe the fine tailoring, the practiced posture. Note the vacant expression, a common trait of the species.* He positioned the blades around the taut, offensively purple ribbon. The cameras flashed, a volley of silent, bright explosions. He snipped. The ribbon fell in two sad, curling pieces. Applause, thin and scattered like drizzle on the pavement, followed. He had done his duty. Again.

The drive back to Scone Palace was a silent, hermetic affair. The royal limousine, a gleaming black vessel of tradition, slid through the streets of Perth with funereal grace. Through the bulletproof glass, the city was a pantomime. People stopped and pointed, their faces a mixture of deference and curiosity. They weren't seeing him, Alistair knew. They were seeing a symbol, a storybook figure made flesh. They saw the Crown. They had no idea the man beneath it was slowly suffocating. The weight of the Crown wasn't the literal heft of St Edward's, a relic he’d worn precisely once. It was the crushing, relentless expectation of every single day. A day planned to the minute. A life planned to the second.

Then he heard it.

The motorcade had been forced to a crawl by a snarl of traffic near the Tay Street bridge. And through the thick, sound-dampening glass, a noise leaked in. It was raw, and a little rough. A sound not of orchestras or sanitised string quartets, but of calloused fingers on steel strings. On the corner, a young man with a thatch of unruly red hair and a threadbare coat was leaning against a wall, a battered acoustic guitar cradled in his arms. He wasn't playing for the tourists or the traffic. His eyes were closed, his head tilted back, lost in the simple, melancholic progression of chords he was strumming. It wasn’t a performance. It was a conversation between him and the instrument. A sound so honest, so utterly devoid of pomp or protocol, it struck Alistair with the force of a physical blow. It was the sound of freedom.

The traffic cleared. The limousine purred forward, leaving the busker behind. But the sound remained, snagged in Alistair’s mind. A simple C chord, bleeding into a G. It was imperfect. You could hear the scrape of fingers on the frets, a slight buzz from one of the strings. It was human.

Back in the palace, the silence was a presence. It was polished and maintained, buffed to a high sheen like the acres of mahogany furniture. The air itself smelled of beeswax and history. Portraits of his ancestors, stern-faced men and women in ruffs and tartan, watched his every move from their gilded frames. They had cut ribbons, too. They had launched ships. They had smiled the same smile. Had they also felt this creeping sense of irrelevance?

“A productive morning, Your Majesty.” Lord Harrington, the King’s Private Secretary, materialized from the shadows of the Grand Hallway. He was a tall, desiccated man who looked as though he had been carved from a particularly unforgiving piece of granite. He held a leather-bound folder. He always held a leather-bound folder. It was less an accessory and more a part of his anatomy.

“Deeply,” Alistair said, his voice flat. He began to unbutton his gloves. “Provost Miller believes we have birthed a new artery of commerce.”

“Indeed. A significant boon for the local economy,” Harrington replied, utterly without irony. He fell into step beside Alistair as they walked towards the King’s private study. “This afternoon’s agenda: the preliminary review of the Honours list for the New Year, followed by a teleconference with the Canadian High Commissioner at four. I’ve also taken the liberty of preparing your notes for the annual address to the Friends of the Perth Museum and Art Gallery.”

Alistair stopped, turning to face his secretary. The busker’s raw music was still echoing in his head, a stark contrast to the dry rustle of Harrington's agenda. “Harrington,” he began, the question forming even as he spoke it, “do you ever feel… a lack of… tangible output?”

Harrington blinked. It was a slow, reptilian motion. “Your Majesty’s output is the stability and continuity of the monarchy itself. A priceless, if intangible, asset.”

“Yes, of course. The great intangible asset,” Alistair murmured, waving a hand dismissively. “I meant something for oneself. A skill. A craft. Something created with one’s own hands.”

A thin, disapproving smile touched Harrington’s lips. “Patronage of the arts has long been a pursuit of the Crown. Your support for the Scottish National Orchestra is most commendable.”

“I don’t mean patronage, Harrington. I mean participation. Actually… doing it.” The image of the busker returned, eyes closed in bliss. “What do you think of the guitar?”

The question hung in the air between them, so alien in that context it might as well have been spoken in another language. Harrington’s face, a carefully curated mask of neutrality, flickered with something Alistair could only describe as profound distaste. “The guitar, Your Majesty? It is an instrument of… popular entertainment. Often associated with unseemly public displays and a certain… lack of formal discipline.”

“So, fun, you mean?”

“I mean unsuitable, Your Majesty,” Harrington said, his voice dropping to a glacial chill. “Your hands are for signing treaties, for shaking the hands of dignitaries, for waving to your people. They are not for developing calluses in the pursuit of a fleeting, and frankly undignified, hobby.” He tapped the folder. “The Honours list, sire?”

Defeated, Alistair nodded and walked into his study. The conversation was over. The walls, lined with leather-bound books he’d never read and maps of a kingdom he only ever saw from a car window, seemed to press in on him. He sat at his desk, a behemoth of Victorian oak, and stared at the first document. Sir Reginald Pumble, for services to the Scottish Dairy Industry. Alistair picked up his pen, the silence of the room roaring in his ears. The simple, honest sound of that guitar was already fading, being scrubbed away by the antiseptic quiet of the palace. He felt a surge of something hot and unfamiliar. Not just discontent. Rebellion.

Later that day, avoiding the wing where Harrington’s offices were, Alistair found himself climbing a narrow spiral staircase to the west tower, a part of the palace that had long ago been abandoned to storage and dust. But not entirely. At the top, a heavy oak door was propped open with a paint-spattered boot. From within came the sharp, clean scent of turpentine and linseed oil, and the low hum of a radio playing some obscure, moody jazz.

This was Ewan’s domain.

His step-brother was standing before a vast canvas, a figure of intense, chaotic concentration. Ewan was the polar opposite of Alistair. Where Alistair was tailored and restrained, Ewan was perpetually smudged with paint, his dark hair a mess, his clothes functional rather than formal. He was the artist in the gilded cage, the unofficial, unacknowledged shadow to Alistair’s sun. The product of their father’s brief, scandalous second marriage, Ewan had a place in the palace, but no role. A royal afterthought.

Ewan didn’t turn. He was dabbing at the canvas with a palette knife, creating a slash of violent crimson against a field of deep, brooding blue. “Come to critique the work, Ally? Or just slumming it?”

“Neither,” Alistair said, stepping into the studio. The room was a beautiful mess. Canvases leaned against every wall, jars bristling with brushes covered every surface, and tubes of paint were strewn about like spent cartridges. It was the most alive room in the entire palace. “I had a question.”

Ewan grunted, scraping the knife clean on a rag. “Shoot.”

“The guitar,” Alistair said, feeling foolish all over again.

Ewan finally turned, a flicker of genuine surprise in his eyes. He leaned back against a workbench, folding his paint-stained arms. “What about it? Run over a busker in the limo?”

“I saw one. Playing. It just… it seemed…”

“Real?” Ewan offered, a wry smile playing on his lips. “Unlike all this?” He gestured vaguely, a gesture that encompassed the studio, the palace, their entire strange lives.

“Yes,” Alistair admitted, the word a quiet confession. “I was thinking of… learning.”

Ewan stared at him for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Alistair braced himself for the mockery, the easy cynicism that was Ewan’s primary defense against the world. But it didn't come. Instead, Ewan just shrugged, a gesture of surprising neutrality. “It’s a box with strings, Ally. You can make it sing or you can make it scream. All depends on who’s holding it. And why.” He turned back to his painting. “Just don’t expect to be any good. Not for a long time. It takes blood. Literally. On your fingertips.”

The conversation, brief and unsatisfying as it was, settled something in Alistair. Ewan hadn’t laughed. He hadn't judged. He had simply stated a fact. It takes blood. The idea was thrilling. A task that required not just his time, but a piece of himself.

That evening, Alistair summoned his valet, a young, tech-savvy man named Finn who was more comfortable with iPads than silver polish. He found him in the staff pantry, scrolling through his phone.

“Finn,” Alistair said, his voice low, conspiratorial. “I require your assistance with a… discreet purchase.”

Finn straightened up, pocketing his phone. “Of course, Your Majesty. Another set of antique cufflinks? A rare first-edition Burns?”

“No,” Alistair said, leaning closer. “A guitar. An acoustic guitar. A good one. And it needs to be delivered here, to the palace, without Lord Harrington or, for that matter, anyone else, knowing about it. It must arrive as if it were a… a box of printer paper. Or a new rug. Something utterly mundane.”

Finn’s eyes widened, a grin spreading across his face. For the first time, he looked at Alistair not as an employer or a monarch, but as a co-conspirator. “I think,” he said, his voice barely a whisper, “that can be arranged, sire.”

Two days later, a large, rectangular cardboard box arrived, addressed to the junior archivist’s office and marked ‘Archival Storage Materials – Fragile’. Finn intercepted it with the stealth of a trained spy and wheeled it on a trolley up to the King’s private quarters via a service lift. He left it in the centre of Alistair’s bedroom, a brown cardboard Trojan horse in the heart of the monarchy.

That night, long after the palace had settled into its deep, historic slumber, Alistair locked his bedroom door. His heart hammered against his ribs with an excitement he hadn’t felt since he was a boy. He knelt on the priceless Aubusson carpet and sliced open the box with a silver letter opener. Inside, nestled in a cocoon of black velvet, was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. A Martin acoustic guitar. Its spruce top was the colour of pale honey, the mahogany back and sides a rich, dark chocolate. The wood grain swirled and danced. It smelled of forest and lacquer and promise.

He lifted it out. It was lighter than he’d expected, yet it felt substantial, potent. He sat on the edge of his four-poster bed, the very bed his father and grandfather had slept in, and positioned the instrument awkwardly on his lap. He looked at his hands – soft, pale, manicured. Harrington’s words echoed in his mind. *Not for developing calluses*. He ignored them. He remembered the shape the busker’s hand had made. He tried to copy it, his fingers fumbling on the fretboard, pressing down on the cold, unyielding strings. Then, taking a breath, he raked his other hand across the soundhole.

The sound that emerged was not music. It was a complaint, a strangled thud of muted strings and fret buzz, an affront to the gilded silence of the room. It was horrible. It was pathetic.

And Alistair IV, King of the United Kingdom’s smallest and most ceremonial monarchy, threw his head back and laughed. It was a real laugh, loud and unrestrained. It was the sound of a key turning in a lock. It was the sound of a beginning.The laughter died in his throat, replaced by a sudden, sharp paranoia. The sound had been too loud, too vital for these hallowed, silent halls. He half-expected the door to burst open, revealing a phalanx of concerned security guards or, worse, the granite-faced disapproval of Lord Harrington. He held his breath, listening. There was nothing. Only the hum of the ancient palace, the whisper of the central heating through ornate vents. He had gotten away with it. The knowledge was intoxicating. He laid the guitar back in its case, the velvet lining a soft, dark secret, and slid it under the vast, valanced bed. It was a childish hiding place, but for now, it would have to do.

The next few nights established a new, clandestine rhythm. After the last of the household staff had retired, after the final security sweep had been logged, Alistair would lock his door and retrieve his prize. Propped against a mountain of pillows, an iPad glowing in the dark, he entered the sprawling, democratic university of the internet. He found a channel hosted by a cheerful Canadian man who broke down the rudiments of the instrument with maddeningly simple instructions. “Okay folks, today we’re gonna learn the C chord. Just put your first finger here on the second string, first fret…”

Alistair’s fingers, accustomed to the smooth barrel of a fountain pen or the delicate stem of a wine glass, felt clumsy and thick. They refused to bend at the correct angles, muting adjacent strings and producing a sound like a bag of damp laundry being dropped on the floor. The tips of his fingers on his left hand began to ache, then burn. Within an hour, they were tender and red, imprinted with the angry red lines of the steel strings. Ewan’s words came back to him. *It takes blood. Literally.* He had dismissed it as artistic hyperbole, but now he felt the truth of it. This was not a pursuit of the mind; it was a physical discipline, a negotiation between flesh and steel. Frustration mounted, a familiar sour taste in his mouth, but this time it was different. It wasn't the impotent frustration of his daily life; it was a productive, challenging burn. When he finally managed a clean, ringing C chord, the three notes hanging in the air for a perfect, shimmering second, the satisfaction was more profound than any applause he had ever received.

His secret life began to bleed into his public one. During a lengthy briefing on agricultural subsidies, he found himself staring at his hand, covertly pressing the tip of his ring finger against his thumb, feeling for the nascent toughness of a callus. He caught himself mentally tracing the shape of a G chord while reviewing troop deployment reports for a regiment of which he was the honorary colonel. Lord Harrington, ever observant, noticed the shift. The King’s attention, usually a placid, if distant, lake, now had ripples on its surface.

“Is everything to Your Majesty’s satisfaction?” Harrington asked one afternoon, pausing in his recitation of upcoming engagements. Alistair had been staring out the window, his gaze distant.

“Quite, Harrington. Just… contemplating the view,” Alistair replied, forcing himself back to the present.

“Indeed. The grounds are looking particularly well-manicured,” the secretary said, with a pointed glance at Alistair’s own hands, resting on the desk. “As are Your Majesty’s.” It wasn't a compliment. It was a reminder. A warning. Alistair curled his fingers into a fist, hiding the reddened tips. The need for a more secure location for his practice became urgent. His bedroom was too exposed, the risk of discovery by a chambermaid or a valet with a misplaced sense of duty was too high. The ghost of his laughter still haunted him, a reminder of his carelessness.

He thought of the warren of rooms in the palace’s disused wings. Generations of royal clutter—forgotten furniture, rolled-up tapestries, crates of correspondence from minor European relatives who had been on the wrong side of history. He needed a sanctuary, a place where a strangled G chord would be swallowed by dust and distance. He recalled the spiral staircase to the west tower, the one he had taken to find Ewan. But Ewan's studio was below the very top. Above it, Alistair remembered from childhood explorations, was one last room: the old royal observatory. It had been decommissioned a century ago when the city's light pollution had rendered it useless. It was small, round, and crowned with a domed copper roof. And, most importantly, it was entirely forgotten.

The following evening, armed with a heavy iron key sourced from a dusty, mislabeled board in the groundskeeper’s office, Alistair made his ascent. The guitar, back in its case, felt heavy and conspicuous in his hand. Every creak of the stone steps echoed like a gunshot. He reached the door to the observatory, the key grating loudly in the ancient lock. With a final, protesting groan, the door swung inward, releasing a sigh of stale, cold air. The room was circular, its walls lined with empty shelves and spectral brass fittings that had once held telescopes and star charts. A thick layer of dust covered everything, sparkling in the single beam of his torch. In the centre of the room, a large, shrouded object stood like a tombstone. He pulled the dusty canvas away to reveal the massive iron pedestal where the main telescope had once been mounted. High above, small, grime-covered windows circled the base of the dome, letting in slivers of the moonlit sky. It was perfect. It was a fortress of solitude at the heart of his own prison. He felt a sense of triumph, of ownership. This was his space, reclaimed from history for a purpose that was entirely his own.The observatory became his kingdom. Each night, the long climb up the spiral staircase was a pilgrimage away from the man on the coins and toward the man he was becoming. He brought up an old wooden stool from a forgotten servants’ hall, its surface scarred with the history of people who had actually worked for a living. He used a silk handkerchief from his breast pocket to wipe down a section of the brass pedestal, creating a clean surface to rest his iPad. The dust motes that danced in the slivers of moonlight were not an annoyance but a kind of celestial glitter, a sign that he was in a place untouched by the relentless polishing and perfecting that defined the rest of his existence. The air, thick with the scent of aged paper and cold stone, was a balm after the cloying aroma of beeswax and potpourri below.

The nightly ritual was brutal and beautiful. The pain in his fingertips evolved from a sharp, angry protest to a dull, persistent throb. He would examine them in the glow of the iPad, studying the hardened, shiny patches of skin that were forming. He thought of them as his Honours list, tangible awards for services to his own sanity. The clumsy, muted thuds of his first attempts slowly, painstakingly, gave way to something that resembled music. He learned the names of the chords like a new language: C, G, A minor. They felt more real in his mouth than the names of the dignitaries he was forced to memorize daily. He found a simple arrangement of ‘Wild Mountain Thyme’, a song his Scottish nanny had sung to him as a boy, and for the first time in the dusty silence of the tower, he connected the chords into a melody. It was halting and flawed, but it was his. He had created it, coaxing it from wood and wire with his own two hands. In that moment, the howling void behind his sternum was filled, not with a roar, but with a quiet, imperfect tune.

Lord Harrington’s finely-tuned senses registered the anomaly long before he could name it. It began with small things. The King seemed less fatigued by his afternoon appointments, yet there was a new, almost feverish quality to his private evenings. His usual pre-bedtime glass of single malt was often left untouched. Harrington, a man who believed the monarchy ran on precedent and predictability, found these deviations unsettling. He began to observe Alistair more closely. He noticed the King’s tendency to stare at his own hands during meetings, a subtle flexing of the fingers, as if practicing an unheard melody. One morning, he spotted a faint, dark smudge on the pristine white cuff of the King’s shirt, a particle of dust so ancient it was almost red, like powdered rust. Harrington made a mental note to have a discreet word with the head of household about the cleaning standards in the private wing, but a deeper, more troubling instinct told him the dust had not come from anywhere on the palace’s meticulously maintained map.

The need for accessories became Alistair’s new logistical challenge. He watched the cheerful Canadian on the iPad explain the function of a capo with the same intensity he had once afforded a briefing on trade deficits. The next day, he found Finn polishing a collection of silver regimental trophies in the Long Gallery. He approached with the practiced casualness of a spy. “Finn, a small matter. I find my… digital correspondence would be improved with a particular kind of… stylus. A clamp, of sorts. To hold the page.” Finn, without missing a beat in his polishing, glanced up. A flicker of understanding, and amusement, lit his eyes. “A clamp-style stylus, sire. For easier scrolling. I believe I can source one of a professional quality. Would you require it to be delivered with the usual discretion?” Alistair simply nodded, a wave of gratitude washing over him. The small device, delivered the next day in a box marked ‘Stationery Supplies: Urgent’, felt like a vital piece of ordnance in his silent war.

The risks, he discovered, were part of the thrill. One night, descending from the observatory with the guitar case in hand, he was halfway down the spiral stairs when he heard the unmistakable sound of rubber-soled shoes on the flagstones below. He froze, his heart seizing in his chest. He flattened himself into a narrow, unlit archway that smelled of damp stone, pulling the case tightly against his body. A beam from a torchlight danced up the walls, followed moments later by a young security guard, his face earnest and bored. The guard paused almost directly beneath him, spoke quietly into his radio, and then continued on his patrol. Alistair remained pressed into the stone for a full minute after the footsteps faded, his breath ragged, the adrenaline singing in his veins. He had never felt so vulnerable, or so gloriously, terrifyingly alive. The close call didn't deter him; it emboldened him.

He hit a wall with the F chord. His fingers, now hardened and compliant for the simpler shapes, refused to contort into the required barre position. Every attempt produced a discordant, buzzing rattle that echoed his own mounting frustration. The cheerful Canadian offered endless encouragement, but it wasn't enough. He needed a human eye. He needed Ewan. This time, he didn’t go to the studio with a vague, philosophical question. He went with proof. He found his step-brother attacking a canvas with a furious energy, splattering it with shades of grey and black that seemed to absorb the very light in the room. “Ewan,” Alistair said, his voice steady. Ewan grunted without turning. Alistair stepped into his line of sight and held out his left hand, palm up. The calluses on his fingertips were pale islands on his soft skin. “It takes blood,” Alistair said, repeating Ewan’s own words back to him.

For the first time since Alistair had begun his secret pursuit, Ewan looked genuinely astonished. He put down his charcoal stick, the dust puffing from his fingers, and took Alistair’s hand. He turned it over, examining the fingertips with the critical eye of a fellow craftsman. A slow smile, devoid of its usual cynical armor, spread across his face. “Well, I’ll be damned. You actually did it.” He let go of Alistair’s hand. “The F chord?” he asked, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Alistair nodded, embarrassed. Ewan wiped his hands on a rag and gestured for Alistair to sit. "It's not about strength, Ally. It's about leverage. The angle of your wrist. You’re trying to muscle it. Don’t fight the neck, use it." He demonstrated in the air, his own scarred fingers forming the shape effortlessly. It was a brief, technical lesson, but for Alistair, it was a profound moment of fraternity. It was the first time his brother had ever truly taught him anything. As Alistair turned to leave, Ewan spoke again, his voice returning to its usual wry tone. "Just a piece of advice. Don't just play the notes. The silence between them is where the music actually lives. It's the same with painting. The empty space is what gives the subject its meaning."Ewan’s advice about the silence between the notes became Alistair’s new operating principle. It was a philosophy that extended far beyond the six strings of his guitar. He began to find the silences in his own life, the small, unscripted gaps between the relentless appointments and ceremonies. A thirty-second pause while waiting for his car, where he would close his eyes and simply listen to the sound of the city beyond the palace walls. A moment during a mind-numbing privy council meeting where, instead of feigning interest, he would study the fall of light through the tall Palladian windows, noticing how it illuminated the dust motes in a way that reminded him of his observatory. He started to see his life not as a solid, suffocating block of duty, but as a series of loud, often meaningless notes, punctuated by moments of quiet, private grace. These silences were where he now lived.

This newfound perspective did not go unnoticed by Lord Harrington. The King’s passive endurance had been replaced by something more unnerving: a detached, almost serene focus. He would nod at the correct moments, his smile was as precise as ever, but there was an abstraction in his eyes, as if he were listening to a different piece of music entirely. Harrington, a man whose entire career was built on the management of a predictable and unchanging institution, felt a deep, instinctual alarm. An unpredictable king was a constitutional crisis in miniature. He began his own quiet investigation, not with spies, but with paperwork, the weapon he knew best. He cross-referenced staff logs, housekeeping reports, and maintenance requests. He found nothing, and this absence of evidence was, to his suspicious mind, the most damning evidence of all. It spoke of a secret kept with skill and purpose.

The decisive clue came from the most mundane of sources. A junior archivist, eager to impress, submitted a request for improved climate control in the west wing’s lower storage rooms, citing the potential for damp to damage historical documents. In reviewing the palace blueprints to assess the request, Harrington’s gaze drifted upwards, following the lines of the building to its highest, most neglected point. The West Tower Observatory. A forgotten room, accessible by a single, rarely-used staircase. A place with no official function, no staff rota, no reason for anyone to ever go there. A perfect black hole in the palace’s meticulously documented universe. It was there, he felt a cold certainty, that the anomaly would be found. He did not need to know what it was; he only needed to reclaim the space for the institution. The next morning, a formal memo was circulated among the senior staff. Citing insurance liabilities and the need for a full structural survey, Lord Harrington had ordered the entire west tower to be inventoried, cleaned, and sealed, effective in forty-eight hours.

Finn delivered the news with the quiet urgency of a field agent reporting enemy movements. He found the King in the library, ostensibly reviewing a biography of his great-grandfather but in reality tracing chord shapes on the leather arm of his chair. “A memo, sire,” Finn whispered, placing a single sheet of paper beside the book. “From Lord Harrington.” Alistair read it, his blood turning to ice. A full inventory. Cleaned and sealed. It was an eviction notice. A polite, bureaucratic declaration of war. That night, he made his final journey to the observatory. The room felt different, already tinged with the sadness of abandonment. He didn’t play. He simply stood in the center, looking at the stool, the brass pedestal, the slivers of moonlight through the grimy windows. This small, dusty circle had been the only part of his kingdom that had ever truly belonged to him. With a heavy heart, he packed the guitar into its case, took one last look, and closed the heavy oak door on his brief, beautiful rebellion.

The following night was a frantic, whispered affair. The guitar case was a coffin containing his nascent freedom, and there was nowhere to bury it. Under the bed was no longer an option; Harrington’s memo had made him paranoid about the thoroughness of the palace staff. Ewan’s studio was the first place a suspicious mind might look. He paced the length of his vast, silent bedroom, the case standing sentinel by the door. His eyes scanned the room, seeing not a home but a series of potential liabilities. The antique chests, the writing desks, the armoires—all were subject to the prying eyes of valets and housekeepers. His gaze fell upon the largest piece of furniture in the room, a colossal mahogany wardrobe that took up nearly an entire wall. It didn’t hold his suits or daily wear. It was reserved for the relics.

Inside, hanging in breathable garment bags labelled in a neat, spidery script, was the iconography of his office. The deep green velvet robes of the Order of the Thistle. The military dress uniform of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, heavy with gold braid. The impossibly heavy tartan kilt and plaid worn to the Highland Games. It was the closet of the storybook figure, the symbol made flesh. It was the one place no one would dare disturb without a direct, formal order for a ceremonial occasion. It was a perfect hiding place, a sublime act of sacrilege. With trembling hands, he opened the wardrobe. The air smelled of cedar and history. He pushed aside a sweeping ermine-trimmed cloak, its ceremonial weight a dead thing in his hands, and carefully stood the guitar case in the dark space behind it. He nestled it between the stiff, formal pleats of a kilt and the empty, decorated sleeve of a uniform. The honest, simple box of wood and wire, hidden amongst the gilded costumes of his captivity. He closed the doors, the faint click of the latch sounding unnaturally loud in the silent room.

The next day, Alistair went through his duties in a state of high alert. He attended a luncheon for a visiting trade delegation, his mind filled with the imagined sounds of cleaning crews ascending the west tower staircase. He could almost hear them forcing the lock on the observatory door, their footsteps echoing in his empty sanctuary. Late in the afternoon, Harrington appeared at his study door, a thin file in his hand. “The survey of the west tower is complete, Your Majesty,” he announced, his voice betraying nothing. “The structural integrity is sound. The archivists will be pleased.” He paused, his gaze as sharp and colourless as ice. “Nothing of interest was found. A few historical curiosities, a great deal of dust. The space is now secure.” Alistair met his gaze, his own expression a carefully constructed mask of mild interest. “Excellent, Harrington. Good to know our house is in order.” The secretary gave a curt nod and departed, leaving Alistair alone with the roaring silence. He had won the battle. But he knew, with chilling certainty, the war was just beginning.

Deprived of his sanctuary, Alistair was forced back into the confines of his bedroom. The risk was greater now, the thrill sharper. He could no longer risk the full, ringing voice of the Martin. He learned to play with a new subtlety, his strumming hand barely brushing the strings, his left hand pressing with just enough force to form the chord without creating a loud report. He took one of his cashmere scarves and wove it through the strings near the bridge, muting the sound to a dull, intimate thrum that was barely audible a few feet away. The confinement changed his playing. Unable to fill a room with sound, he began to explore the intricate spaces between the notes Ewan had spoken of. His fingers, now more nimble, started to pick out single-note melodies, quiet and tentative at first, then with growing confidence. He wasn't just copying songs anymore. One night, after a particularly draining day spent mediating a petty dispute between two aristocratic charities, he sat on the edge of his bed and a melody unspooled from his fingers. It was a simple, mournful tune in A minor. It was the sound of a long, silent drive through a city that saw him but didn't know him. It was the sound of a gilded cage. It was his own.The melody became his secret language, a vocabulary of three chords and a handful of notes that said more than any speech he had ever given. He called it ‘The View from the Window’, a simple, plaintive theme that ebbed and flowed with a quiet melancholy. Playing it with the cashmere scarf woven through the strings created a strange, intimate effect. The sound was a ghost of itself, a percussive whisper that died almost as soon as it was born, unable to escape the confines of his opulent prison. Yet, in that muffled thrum, Alistair found a universe of expression. He could feel the vibration transfer from the body of the guitar through his chest, a secret pulse that was his alone, a heartbeat beneath the floorboards of the monarchy.

His nights were for creation, his days for containment. The dissonance was growing harder to manage. The world outside his bedroom door demanded a man made of smiles and pleasantries, while the man inside was grappling with the raw, frustrating beauty of an F chord. The calluses on his fingers were now a permanent feature, small shields of hardened skin he would touch compulsively during meetings, a physical reminder of his other life. Lord Harrington, noticing the tic, mistook it for a sign of royal agitation. In his view, the King’s disquiet required a familiar remedy: a heavier dose of duty, a schedule so relentlessly packed there would be no time for introspection, let alone the mysterious ailment that had taken root in the sovereign.

“Your Majesty,” Harrington announced, entering the study one morning without the customary preliminary knock, a subtle assertion of his authority. Alistair, startled, instinctively hid his left hand under a stack of briefing papers. Harrington placed a newly-bound itinerary on the gleaming desk. It was thick. “The arrangements for Your Majesty’s autumn progress through the northern shires have been finalized. Ten days. Fourteen towns. We begin in Stonehaven with the rededication of the harbourmaster’s office.” He delivered the litany of engagements like a judge passing sentence: visits to a new windfarm, a recently amalgamated school, a shortbread factory. Each event was a perfectly polished stone laid on Alistair’s chest. “It will be an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the Crown’s steadfast presence in these changing times,” Harrington concluded, his gaze lingering for a fraction of a second on Alistair’s partially concealed hand.

After the secretary had departed, Alistair stared at the itinerary. It wasn’t a schedule; it was a cage on wheels. Ten days away from the palace, from the wardrobe, from the muffled whisper of his guitar. Ten days of being King Alistair IV, non-stop. The melody in his head, his fragile ‘View from the Window’, suddenly felt ephemeral, a tune written on mist that would surely dissipate under the harsh lights of public duty. He felt a surge of panic, a desperate need to anchor it, to make it real before it vanished. He needed to show it to someone. He needed Ewan.

He found his step-brother not in the chaotic frenzy of creation, but in a rare moment of quiet contemplation. Ewan sat on a paint-splattered stool, staring at a canvas that was, for once, almost entirely white. A few spare, aggressive charcoal lines hinted at a shape, a landscape of absence. The air, usually thick with the smell of turpentine, was still. “Bad day at the office?” Ewan asked, his voice softer than usual, not turning around. Alistair came to stand beside him, the silent canvas a reflection of the void he had so long felt within himself. “I have something,” Alistair said, the words feeling inadequate. “It’s not… finished. It’s barely anything. But it’s mine.” He hesitated, feeling a familiar fool’s flush creep up his neck. Then, taking a breath, he began to hum, his voice low and unused to carrying a tune. He hummed the simple, sad melody he had composed in the dead of night.

Ewan listened, his head cocked. He didn't mock. He didn't even smile. His artist’s eyes, so used to seeing the truth of a line or the lie in a colour, were focused on some middle distance as the melody filled the quiet studio. When Alistair finished, the silence that followed was heavy and expectant. “That’s it,” Ewan said, finally. “That’s the sound of this place.” He gestured with a charcoal-stained thumb, not at the palace, but at the empty canvas. “It’s the space between things. The bit you’re not supposed to see. It’s not a victory march, is it? It’s the walk back to your room after the parade is over.” He stood up and walked to a cluttered shelf, retrieving a small, dusty digital voice recorder he used for making audio notes. He tossed it to Alistair, who caught it clumsily. “A thought isn’t real until you write it down,” Ewan said, his eyes meeting his brother’s. “A tune is just air until you catch it. Go catch it, Ally. Before someone else tells you what it’s supposed to sound like.”

The small, dense weight of the recorder in his hand was a revelation. It was one thing to play for himself, a fleeting act of defiance. To record it was something else entirely. It was an act of preservation, of validation. It was creating evidence. The thought sent a fresh jolt of fear and excitement through him. This was a new, more dangerous phase of the game. He couldn’t just use the recorder’s tiny, tinny built-in microphone. If he was going to do this, he was going to do it properly. He would capture the true voice of the guitar, the rich warmth of the spruce and mahogany, not just the muted whisper he was forced to play. This would require more equipment. More subterfuge. More Finn.

He found his valet later that afternoon, overseeing the delivery of a new consignment of wine to the palace cellars. Alistair drew him aside into a cool, damp alcove that smelled of earth and old vintages. “Finn,” he said, his voice a low conspiracy. “Our… archival project requires expansion.” Finn’s expression remained professionally blank, but his eyes were alive with curiosity. “I need to make a recording. An audio document. Of a high fidelity.” He showed Finn the simple recorder Ewan had given him. “This is insufficient. I need to capture a… source with nuance. I’m told I need a proper microphone. And a device to connect it to a laptop. An… interface.” The technical words felt alien on his tongue. Finn took in the information, his mind clearly working through the logistics, the potential pitfalls, the necessary layers of misdirection. A slow grin spread across his face, the grin of a man who relished a challenge. “High-fidelity audio archiving, Your Majesty. A most worthy pursuit. I imagine such sensitive equipment would need to be shipped in a very particular way. Perhaps disguised as something utterly uninteresting. Say, plumbing supplies for the east wing lavatories?” Alistair could only nod, a wave of profound relief and gratitude washing over him. The conspiracy was growing, and for the first time in his life, he felt he was not entirely alone.The box arrived on a flatbed trolley pushed by a junior footman who thought he was delivering plumbing spares for a persistently troublesome guest bathroom in the east wing. It was large, grimy, and emblazoned with the logo of a Glasgow-based industrial supplier: ‘Pimlico Pipes & Fittings’. Finn intercepted the trolley in a service corridor, dismissing the footman with a casual wave and a plausible story about rerouting the delivery to the correct maintenance hub. He then wheeled the trolley himself, taking a circuitous route through the palace’s underbelly—past laundry rooms humming with industrial dryers and wine cellars sleeping in the cool dark—before ascending in a small, shuddering service lift. He left the box outside the King’s private dressing room, gave a single, soft knock, and vanished as silently as he had appeared.

Alistair opened the door to an empty hallway. The box stood there, an object of magnificent mundanity, an affront to the polished grandeur surrounding it. He dragged it inside, the scrape of cardboard on the deep-pile carpet sounding like a roar. Inside his bedroom, with the door securely bolted, he attacked the packaging with a pair of antique silver shears. Beneath layers of brown paper and foam pellets were not U-bends and gaskets, but sleek, black instruments of a different trade. There was a condenser microphone, heavy and cool in his hand, its mesh grille as intricate as a piece of jewellery. There was a small, dense metal box covered in knobs and inputs—the audio interface. And there were thick, rubbery cables that coiled like sleeping snakes. These were not the tools of a monarch. They were the tools of a creator, and the sight of them, so alien and full of potential, made his heart beat a frantic, syncopated rhythm.

Setting up the makeshift studio was an exercise in intense, whispered concentration. He consulted a series of bookmarked video tutorials on his iPad, his brow furrowed in a way it never was when reviewing cabinet papers. He clamped the microphone stand to the edge of his mahogany writing desk, a scandalous juxtaposition of the modern and the baronial. He learned the esoteric difference between a USB and an XLR cable, carefully connecting the microphone to the interface, the interface to his laptop. When he finally opened the recording software, a program he’d downloaded with the same furtive energy he’d once used to sneak cigarettes as a schoolboy, he was greeted by a blank, intimidating timeline. He put on a pair of sleek, noise-cancelling headphones—another of Finn’s discreet acquisitions—and tentatively tapped the microphone. A sharp green peak shot across the screen. He drew a breath and spoke his own name, “Alistair.” The sound came back to him through the headphones, intimate and unfamiliar, his voice stripped of its royal echo, a simple human sound transformed into a visible, manipulable line of data. The feeling was vertiginous.

That night, he performed not for himself, but for the unforgiving, impartial ear of the microphone. He retrieved the Martin from its hiding place amongst the ceremonial ghosts in the wardrobe. He positioned the mic as the tutorials had instructed, aimed at the twelfth fret where the neck met the body. He did not use the cashmere scarf this time. The act of recording demanded honesty, a complete and unadulterated sound. Taking a deep, steadying breath, he pressed the glowing red record button. The silent room was suddenly charged with a sense of immense gravity. He began to play. The simple, mournful notes of ‘The View from the Window’ filled the headphones, clearer and richer than he had ever heard them before. He could hear everything: the subtle slide of his callused fingertips on the steel, the faint resonant hum of the spruce top, a slight hesitation as he transitioned to the difficult F chord. It was a perfect, unvarnished document of his imperfection. It was the truest thing he had ever made.

In his own quiet domain, a study lined with biographies of statesmen, Lord Harrington was also engaged in an act of creation. He was sculpting the King’s autumn progress. The itinerary, as it stood, was a masterpiece of tedium, a slow, grinding tour of civic duty designed to reassert the monarchy’s relevance and, more importantly, to exhaust the King’s nascent restlessness. But as he reviewed the schedule, he felt it was missing something. A flourish. A strategic masterstroke. The King’s recent abstraction had a strange, artistic quality to it, a dreamer’s detachment. Harrington, a man who saw emotion as a vulnerability to be exploited, decided to confront the ghost in the machine head-on. He picked up the phone to his counterpart in the Scottish government’s cultural office. “An excellent suggestion,” Harrington said into the receiver, his voice dry as dust. “His Majesty would be delighted to visit a project that engages with the youth. That music initiative in Glasgow, you say? ‘Rockin’ the Gorbals’? What a vibrant, contemporary name. Please, add it to the schedule. A tour and perhaps a short, informal performance from the students.”

Alistair was lost in his work. He had finished the first take and was listening back, a critical frown on his face. The tempo had wavered slightly in the middle section. The final chord hadn’t rung out as cleanly as he’d hoped. It was the curse of the creator: the gap between the perfect ideal in his head and the flawed reality he had produced. But the flaw was also the beauty. It was human. Emboldened, he reset the track. He would do one more take, this time playing with more confidence, more feeling, letting the melody breathe. He pressed record again, closed his eyes, and poured the accumulated frustration of his day, his week, his life, into the simple, repeating melody. The music swelled, a little louder this time, a little more insistent, the sound of a man trying to be heard, if only by himself.

He was so engrossed he didn’t hear the footsteps in the corridor. The knock on his bedroom door was not the soft, conspiratorial tap of Finn, but a series of sharp, decisive raps that vibrated through the ancient wood. “Your Majesty?” The voice was clear, crisp, and utterly unmistakable. It was Harrington. Panic, cold and absolute, seized Alistair. His eyes flew open. The laptop screen glowed with the evidence of his crime, the moving waveform a visual confession. The microphone stood sentinel on its stand, a black finger pointing accusingly at him. The guitar was a warm, living thing in his lap. For a heart-stopping second, he was paralyzed, caught between his two worlds. Then, adrenaline surged. With frantic, silent speed, he lunged forward, slamming the laptop shut. He yanked the cables from the interface, grabbed the microphone and its stand, and shoved the entire apparatus under the heavy velvet bedspread. He laid the guitar gently on the floor and threw his damask dressing gown over it, a pathetic camouflage. His heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird. He took a single, ragged breath, smoothed his hair, and walked to the door, forcing his face into a mask of regal calm.

He opened it to find Harrington standing there, ramrod straight, his expression impassive. He held a single sheet of paper. “My apologies for the late hour, Your Majesty,” the secretary said, though his tone conveyed no apology at all. “A final, rather exciting addition has been made to the itinerary for the northern progress. I wanted to inform you personally.” Alistair leaned against the doorframe, praying his trembling wasn't visible. "Indeed, Harrington? What could be so exciting as to warrant a visit at this hour?" Harrington’s lips curved into the thinnest of smiles. "We have secured a visit to a youth music charity in Glasgow. A project called ‘Rockin’ the Gorbals’. They provide musical tuition to underprivileged children. I’m told they are quite proficient with the… guitar.” The final word was dropped into the conversation with the deliberate, chilling precision of a single drop of poison. He handed the paper to Alistair. “They are planning a small performance for you. I trust that will be to Your Majesty’s liking.” Defeated, Alistair took the paper, his hand numb. “I’m sure it will be… deeply enriching,” he murmured. As Harrington turned and walked away, his footsteps echoing down the long, silent hall, Alistair closed the door. He leaned his head against the cool wood, the silence of the room roaring in his ears. On his laptop, safe for now, was the recording of his secret heart. And in ten days, he was going to have to sit on a public stage and watch children play the very instrument that was threatening to tear his world apart.The silence that descended after Harrington’s footsteps faded was more profound and terrifying than any he had ever known. It was the silence of a checkmate. Alistair stood frozen, the itinerary clutched in his hand, the paper crinkling under the pressure of his grip. He felt exposed, stripped bare in the heart of his own fortress. With a surge of desperate energy, he re-bolted the door and scrambled to retrieve his hidden life. The microphone, the interface, the nest of cables—they felt different now, no longer tools of liberation but pieces of incriminating evidence. The guitar, when he lifted it from beneath his dressing gown, seemed to have lost its warmth.

He sat on the edge of the bed, the headphones once again over his ears, and located the file on his laptop. He pressed play. The sound of his own melody, his ‘View from the Window’, filled his head. Just minutes ago, it had been a source of fierce, private pride. Now, it sounded like a confession. Every note was a testament to his secret defiance, every scrape of his fingers a piece of forensic data. He could picture Harrington’s thin, triumphant smile, and the image poisoned the music. The King, playing a "popular" instrument. The King, pursuing an "undignified" hobby. Harrington had not just discovered his secret; he had diagnosed it as a sickness and prescribed a public, humiliating cure. To sit on a plastic chair in a community hall and offer polite applause while children demonstrated the simple, honest joy he had tried to steal for himself—it was a punishment of exquisite, calculated cruelty.

The next ten days were a masterclass in psychological warfare. The royal progress began, and Alistair moved through it like a ghost at his own feast. He smiled at mayors, inquired about local industries, and cut ribbons with the same automated precision as always, but his mind was elsewhere. He was trapped in a silent conversation with his private secretary. Every interaction with Harrington was freighted with unspoken meaning. The secretary’s deference was sharper, his efficiency more pronounced. He was the perfect servant, managing the King’s public life while simultaneously dismantling his private one. During a tour of a new fish-processing plant in Peterhead, surrounded by the overwhelming stench of the sea, Harrington leaned in close, ostensibly to be heard over the machinery. "The Gorbals charity is finalising their program, sire," he murmured, his breath cool. "They've chosen a rather traditional folk song. Something simple, so all the students can participate. I’m sure you’ll find it charming." The message was clear: Your music is nothing special. It’s child’s play.

The weight of it all became unbearable. On the fourth day of the tour, during a two-hour gap in the schedule at their temporary residence in a stately home near Inverness, Alistair knew he needed to speak to Ewan. He used a secure line in the study, a line supposedly reserved for matters of state. He felt a grim irony in using it to discuss a matter of the soul. Ewan picked up on the third ring, his voice wary. "This line is recorded by men in sheds with impressive moustaches, you know," he said, by way of greeting. "He knows," Alistair said, dispensing with pleasantries. He explained Harrington’s move, the Glasgow visit, the pointed mention of the guitar. He expected cynicism, mockery, a weary ‘I told you so’. Instead, after a long pause, Ewan let out a short, sharp bark of laughter. It was a sound of pure, unadulterated admiration.

"The granite-faced bastard," Ewan said, a note of genuine awe in his voice. "You have to admit, Ally, it's a work of art. It’s Machiavellian. He hasn't forbidden you, he hasn't accused you. He’s forcing you to watch your own dream being performed by others, and you have to smile and call it delightful. He’s turning your rebellion into a photo-op. It’s genius." The brutal honesty of the assessment, perversely, was a relief. Alistair sagged into the leather chair. "So what do I do? Feign a sudden illness? Abdicate?" he asked, only half-joking. "Don't be an idiot," Ewan shot back, his voice hardening. "You can't run from it. He's built a theatre for your humiliation. So you have to change the play. He expects you to sit there like a benevolent old fossil, patronising the common folk. He’s cast you as the symbol. That’s your weakness. But you’re not just the symbol anymore, are you? You’re a member of the guild, however new."

Alistair didn’t understand. "What are you talking about?" Ewan sighed, the sound crackling over the secure line. "He wants you to watch them play. He assumes you’ll see them as quaint, as a charity case. He doesn’t think you’ll actually *listen*. But you can. You know what it feels like when your finger won’t hold the barre. You know the tiny victory of a clean chord change. He’s showing you a guitar. You need to see the guitarist. Don't go there as a King, Ally. Go there as a musician." The line went quiet for a moment. Then Ewan spoke again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "And one more thing. Your little tune. The one you hummed. Is it safe?" Alistair thought of the file on his laptop, now buried three folders deep and renamed ‘Quarterly Agricultural Reports’. "For now," he said. "Good," Ewan replied. "Hold onto it. An artist’s work is his armour. Now go and suffer through your shortbread factory tour. And for God’s sake, try to look like you’re enjoying it."

The conversation shifted something fundamental in Alistair. The dread didn't vanish, but it was joined by a fragile, new sensation: resolve. Ewan was right. Harrington saw him as a chess piece, the King, powerful but with limited, predictable moves. He had never considered that the piece might have learned a new game. The rest of the tour became a preparation. As he stood on a windy platform overlooking a new North Sea wind farm, the turbines turning with hypnotic grace, he wasn't thinking about renewable energy. He was thinking about chord progressions. As he shook hands with endless lines of local dignitaries, he was memorising the faces, imagining them in the audience in Glasgow. He was no longer a passive victim on his way to the scaffold. He was a strategist planning a counter-offensive, the details of which were still terrifyingly vague, but the intent was sharp and clear.

On the final night before they were due to drive south to Glasgow, Alistair summoned Finn to his suite. The young valet entered, his face a perfect mask of professional discretion. "Your Majesty?" Alistair walked to the window, looking out at the darkened, sleeping town below. "The event tomorrow, Finn. The music charity. I will require a small, discreet alteration to the standard protocol." He turned, his gaze steady. "Lord Harrington’s office will have arranged for a formal gift to be presented to the charity. A plaque, no doubt, or a donation in a sealed envelope. I require a second gift. A personal one. It will need to be procured tomorrow morning, in Glasgow, before we arrive at the event. And it must be done without appearing on any official expense reports or schedules." Finn’s eyes, usually so quick with wit, were serious. He understood the gravity, the deviation from the script. This was not a request for a capo or a microphone; this was a move on the board. "What is the nature of the personal gift, sire?" he asked, his voice low. Alistair allowed himself the smallest of smiles. "Something for a fellow musician," he said. "Something they will understand."The drive south to Glasgow was a silent, pressurized affair. Alistair sat on one side of the limousine’s cavernous rear cabin, Lord Harrington on the other. Neither spoke. The silence was not peaceful; it was tactical, a space crowded with unspoken accusations and strategic calculations. Through the bulletproof glass, the landscape shifted from rolling Perthshire hills to the dense, sprawling suburbs of the country’s industrial heart. Alistair watched the city approach, its cranes and tower blocks piercing a grey, indifferent sky. He felt like a general being driven to a battlefield of the enemy’s choosing. Ewan’s words echoed in his head, a mantra against the fear. *Go there as a musician.* But what did that mean? He was a novice, a fumbler in the dark. His entire repertoire consisted of one sad, simple tune and a handful of awkwardly-formed chords. He clutched the small, heavy package in his coat pocket, its unfamiliar weight a constant, terrifying reminder of the promise he had made to himself.

Just before they had departed the stately home that morning, Finn had materialized in the hallway as Alistair was being helped into his overcoat. With the seamless, invisible efficiency that was his trademark, he had pressed a small, elegantly wrapped box into the King’s hand. “The jeweller in Inverness sent this over for your inspection, sire,” he had murmured, his eyes fixed on a point just over Alistair’s shoulder. “A gift for the Provost’s wife in Oban next month. Best to keep it on your person.” The lie was so smooth, so perfectly embedded in the fabric of his official life, that for a moment Alistair almost believed it. Now, in the car, Harrington’s gaze flickered towards the slight bulge in Alistair’s pocket. The secretary said nothing, but his eyes narrowed. He knew it was an anomaly, a piece that did not fit on the board, and the not-knowing was clearly a source of profound irritation.

The ‘Rockin’ the Gorbals’ youth project was housed in a low, brown-brick community centre that smelled of floor polish, damp coats, and weak tea. The contrast with the marbled halls and gilded ceilings of his life was dizzying. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a flat, clinical glare on the scuffed linoleum floors and the hopeful, hand-drawn posters taped to the walls. Alistair was met by a flustered charity director and a smattering of local councillors, their faces a mixture of awe and anxiety. Harrington took command immediately, his voice a low, reassuring drone that managed the introductions and set the rigid timetable. But Alistair’s attention was elsewhere. His eyes scanned past the dignitaries to the makeshift stage at the far end of the hall. He saw the mismatched amplifiers, the tangle of cables held down with grey gaffer tape, and the row of guitars on cheap stands. One was a bright pink Stratocaster copy with a missing knob; another was a nylon-stringed classical, its body covered in stickers. They were battered, well-used tools, and he felt a pang of something far warmer and more complex than pity. He felt kinship.

A dozen children, ranging in age from about ten to sixteen, filed onto the small stage, their faces a portrait of terrified excitement. They picked up their instruments with a reverence that Alistair recognized instantly. The director announced they would play ‘Caledonia’, a modern folk anthem of homecoming and belonging. At a nod from their tutor, a young man with kind eyes and a frayed jumper, they began. The sound that filled the room was ragged but spirited. Chords were missed, notes were bent sharp, and the rhythm section—a single, over-enthusiastic boy on a snare drum—occasionally lost its way. It was a beautiful, human mess.

And Alistair listened. He did not affect the vague, pleasant smile of a visiting dignitary. He leaned forward in his hard plastic chair, his elbows on his knees, his expression one of intense, focused concentration. He saw a young girl, her face screwed up in determination, her small fingers struggling to stretch across the fretboard to form a clean G chord. He saw a teenage boy with a shock of red hair—so like the busker on the bridge—close his eyes for a moment during a simple solo, lost in the music just as he had been. When another boy’s F chord buzzed out, muted and dead, Alistair felt a muscle in his own jaw tighten in sympathy. He knew that buzz. He knew that frustration. From the corner of his eye, he saw Harrington watching him, and the secretary’s carefully neutral expression had been replaced by one of profound confusion, as if the King had suddenly started speaking in tongues.

The final chord of the song, a triumphant C, rang out and faded into rapturous applause, led by Alistair himself. After a brief, heartfelt speech from the charity director, Lord Harrington stepped forward, the very picture of institutional benevolence. He held a crisp, cream-coloured envelope. “On behalf of His Majesty,” he began, his voice projecting smoothly across the hall, “who has the most profound appreciation for community arts, it is my great pleasure to present this donation to assist in your vital work.” He was about to hand the envelope to the director when Alistair raised a hand. It was a small, quiet gesture, but it held the absolute authority of his office, and the room fell silent. Harrington froze, the envelope suspended in mid-air, his face a sudden, stark mask of disbelief.

“Thank you, Harrington,” Alistair said, his voice calm and clear. He walked forward, not to the director, but to the edge of the stage, placing himself directly in front of the children. He looked at their anxious, expectant faces. “Thank you all,” he said, his voice lower now, more intimate. “That was wonderful. And I don’t mean it was perfect. I mean it was full of heart. And it takes a great deal of courage to play with heart, to risk a wrong note in front of a room full of people. I know.” The words hung in the air, a quiet detonation. Harrington’s face, for the first time in the two decades Alistair had known him, was utterly blank with shock. Alistair’s gaze settled on the boy who had struggled with the F chord, the one who looked mortified by his own mistakes. He reached into his coat.

He did not pull out another cheque. Instead, he produced the small, soft leather pouch. In a move that drew a collective gasp from the assembled dignitaries, Alistair knelt down, the knee of his immaculately tailored suit pressing into the scuffed floor. This single act shattered centuries of protocol. He was no longer a monarch looking down from a great height, but a man meeting a child on his own level. He opened the pouch. Inside, nestled on a bed of dark velvet, was a collection of guitar picks, carved from tortoiseshell, celluloid, and polished horn, in every shape and thickness. They gleamed like jewels in the flat fluorescent light. “Every musician needs the right tools,” Alistair said, his voice just for the boy, yet carrying to the front row where Harrington stood as if carved from stone. “Different ones for different jobs. A thin one for strumming, so you can hear all the strings. A thick one for playing single notes, to make them loud and clear.” He tipped the pouch, and the picks cascaded into the boy’s cupped, trembling hands. “Keep practicing that F chord,” Alistair said, with a conspiratorial smile. “You’re closer than you think.”

For a beat, the hall was locked in stunned silence. Then the applause started. It was not the polite, scattered drizzle of a royal engagement. It was a wave, a loud, warm, and overwhelming crash of genuine emotion. The press cameras, which had been dutifully capturing the formal cheque presentation, whirred and flashed, their lenses now focused on the astonishing, unprecedented image: a King on his knees, sharing a secret with a child. Alistair stood up, brushing a speck of dust from his trousers, and for the first time, he looked directly at Lord Harrington. The secretary’s face was a maelstrom of fury, his carefully constructed world shattered by a handful of plastic and horn. The King had not only walked into the trap, he had dismantled it and used its parts to build a stage of his own. In that single, silent exchange of looks, Alistair knew that the war was far from over, but a pivotal battle had just been won. The silence between the notes had been filled, not with a melody of rebellion, but with an act of connection, and it was a sound that Harrington could not, for the life of him, control.The return journey to Scone Palace was a study in weaponized silence. Alistair sat opposite Lord Harrington, the vast, leather-scented space of the limousine a cold, neutral territory between them. The city of Glasgow, with its stark beauty and industrial grit, slid past the windows, but both men were oblivious. They were locked in the aftermath of the battle, the air thick with the smoke of incinerated protocol. Alistair felt a strange, humming calm. The terror he had anticipated was absent, replaced by a crystalline clarity. He had walked into the fire and discovered it was only stage lighting.

It was Harrington who finally spoke, his voice so devoid of emotion it was like the scrape of a skate on ice. He did not look at Alistair, but stared fixedly at the headrest in front of him. “You have traded a thousand years of institutional mystique for a moment of cheap sentimentality.” It was not an accusation; it was a damage report, delivered with the dispassionate air of an actuary assessing a collapsed bridge. “The Crown is not a participant. It is an observer. It is a symbol. By kneeling, you reduced yourself to the level of a common politician canvassing for votes. You made the symbol small.”

“I believe I connected with one of my subjects, Harrington,” Alistair replied, his own voice steady, surprising him with its firmness. “I had, until recently, been under the impression that was the point of this entire enterprise.”

“The point,” Harrington countered, his voice dropping another degree, “is continuity. Stability. Predictability. The people do not want a king who feels their pain. They want a king who is above it. Your grandfather understood that. Your father understood that. They understood that the distance is the point. You have spent it all on a handful of guitar picks.” He fell silent again, the judgment delivered. For the remainder of the drive, the only sound was the faint, insulated hum of the tyres on the motorway, a sound of relentless, funereal progress. But for the first time, Alistair did not feel like he was being driven to his own burial. He felt as if he were returning from a successful campaign abroad.

The next morning, the fallout was exactly as Ewan had predicted. Finn laid out the morning papers on a silver tray, and the headlines screamed a new narrative. ‘The People’s King,’ declared one tabloid over a full-page, grainy photograph of Alistair on one knee. ‘Kneel Down for Caledonia,’ another proclaimed, its tone a mixture of surprise and delight. A more sober broadsheet featured a lengthy opinion piece from a respected historian, arguing that the monarchy’s survival depended on precisely such radical acts of empathy. Alistair looked at the photograph of himself, a public image he could not control, and felt no dread. The man on his knees looked earnest, engaged, and for the first time, authentic. The press, his lifelong antagonist, had become his accidental accomplice. Harrington had lost control of the story.

A call to Ewan later that morning confirmed the victory. His step-brother was ecstatic. “You glorious bastard!” Ewan crowed down the line. “I saw it on the news. I almost choked on my toast. The look on Harrington’s face! It should be hung in the National Gallery. A portrait of a man watching his life’s work being set on fire by a well-meaning amateur.” He paused, his tone shifting. “But listen, Ally. Don’t get comfortable. You’ve poked the beast. A man like Harrington doesn’t just forget. He’s not going to try and lock you in a tower again. That failed. He’s going to build you a bigger, more beautiful cage and convince you it’s a castle. Watch your back.”

Ewan’s warning proved prophetic. Three days after their return, Lord Harrington requested an audience. He entered Alistair’s study not with the cold fury of the limousine, but with a new, unsettling aura of constructive pragmatism. He placed a slim folder on the desk. Alistair eyed it as if it were a venomous snake. “Your Majesty,” Harrington began, his voice impeccably neutral. “While I must maintain my professional reservations about the… methods employed in Glasgow, the public and media response has been undeniably, and unexpectedly, positive.” He opened the folder. “The office has been inundated with requests for you to engage with similar artistic and youth-oriented charities. It seems you have inadvertently created a new, and very popular, facet of your public persona.”

Alistair felt a knot of dread tighten in his stomach. This was it. The new cage. “And you wish for me to decline these requests?” he asked, testing the waters.

“On the contrary, sire,” Harrington replied, a thin, approving smile touching his lips. It was the smile of a chess player who has just guided his opponent’s piece exactly where he wants it. “I believe we should embrace it. Control it. Formalise it. I have taken the liberty of drafting a proposal for a new royal initiative: ‘The King’s Harmony Trust’. A national endowment to support music education for the underprivileged. It would be your flagship project.” He pushed a document across the desk. It was a fully-formed proposal, complete with a mission statement, a governance structure, and a list of potential corporate sponsors. Harrington had been busy.

“A patron,” Alistair said flatly, seeing the trap.

“More than a patron, Your Majesty. A figurehead. An inspiration.” Harrington’s eyes gleamed with the brilliance of his own strategy. “And to launch the Trust, we would host an inaugural gala at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. A televised event. The highlight, of course, would be a performance. Not by children, this time. But by you.” He let the words hang in the air, a silken noose. “Just a short piece. Something simple. Instrumental, of course. To show your personal commitment. To demonstrate that the King’s interest is not merely symbolic, but active. It would be the crowning moment of this new narrative. Your Majesty’s own composition, perhaps?”

The audacity of it was breathtaking. Harrington was attempting to take his most private act of rebellion—the composition of ‘The View from the Window’—and turn it into a sanctioned, televised, royal duty. He would take the one thing that was truly Alistair’s and put it on display, sanitised and packaged for public consumption, stripping it of its raw, personal meaning. He would take the key to Alistair’s freedom and melt it down to forge a new, more elegant manacle. To refuse would be to seem churlish, to admit his interest was a mere fleeting hobby. To accept would be to surrender the very soul of his rebellion. Alistair looked from Harrington’s placid, triumphant face to the polished proposal on his desk. He felt the walls of the new cage closing in, more beautiful and far more dangerous than the last. He was no longer just fighting for a secret hobby. He was fighting for the ownership of his own song.Alistair looked at the proposal for the King’s Harmony Trust, its crisp pages a testament to Harrington’s ruthless efficiency. He felt a profound, chilling sense of admiration for the man. The trap was perfect, its bars forged from public expectation and gilded with his own nascent passion. To refuse was to be a hypocrite; to accept was to be a puppet. He could feel Harrington’s expectant gaze, waiting for the checkmate, the quiet admission of defeat. Alistair slowly raised his eyes from the document and met his secretary’s stare. He leaned back in his chair, a gesture of faux relaxation, and steepled his soft, callused fingers.

“An ambitious proposal, Harrington,” he said, his voice a placid lake. “And a remarkably thorough one. You have been busy.” He let the faint barb hang in the air for a moment. “I shall, of course, need time to consider its full implications. Such a significant undertaking cannot be entered into lightly.” He did not say yes. He did not say no. He said what a King would say. He deferred. The flicker of triumphant certainty in Harrington’s eyes dimmed, replaced by a flicker of impatience. Alistair had not surrendered. He had simply delayed the inevitable, but in that delay, there was a small, vital space to breathe, to think, to plot.

The next few days were a torment. Alistair walked the halls of his palace, the weight of the decision pressing down on him. The guitar remained in its velvet-lined case, a silent co-conspirator he could no longer consult. To play it now felt like practicing his own surrender speech. He needed Ewan’s particular brand of acid-laced clarity. Under the plausible guise of scouting locations in the capital for the Trust’s future headquarters—a move Harrington heartily endorsed—Alistair had Finn drive him to Edinburgh. He shed his security detail with a practiced excuse and made his way not to a grand civic building, but to a dark, narrow pub in a cobbled lane off the Royal Mile, a place that smelled of spilled beer and centuries of secrets. Ewan was already there, hunched over a pint in a dark corner, looking perfectly at home amongst the shadows.

Alistair slid into the booth opposite him, the worn leather sighing under his weight. He didn’t waste time with greetings. He laid out the entire plan: The King’s Harmony Trust, the gala, the public performance of his own private song. “He’s making me the court jester,” Alistair finished, his voice low and raw. “He’s taking my one piece of truth and turning it into a command performance.” Ewan took a long, slow sip of his beer, his eyes fixed on his brother. He set the glass down with a soft thud. A slow, appreciative smile spread across his face, devoid of all mockery.

“My God, Ally,” he breathed, shaking his head in wonder. “He’s not just building you a cage. He’s tricked you into designing the bloody lock and is about to hand you the key on national television while calling it an act of liberation. The man is a poet. A monster, but a poet.” He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur. “And that’s why you have to do it. You have to walk onto that stage. You have to play that song. Because refusing is exactly what he expects from a cornered animal. You can’t win by running out of the theatre. You can only win by giving a performance he never accounted for.”

“What performance?” Alistair asked, frustration creeping into his voice. “A perfectly polished, three-minute piece of royal elevator music? That’s what he wants. That’s his victory.” “Exactly,” Ewan hissed, his eyes alight with a fierce, strategic fire. “He expects you to clean it up. He wants the King’s version of the song, scrubbed of all its soul. He wants a pleasant melody. You have to give them the original. The one born in a dusty room in the middle of the night. The one that sounds like a man slowly suffocating. You don’t perform it, Ally. You confess it. On live television.”

Ewan’s words struck Alistair with the force of a physical blow. The idea was terrifying, radical, and felt more true than anything he had ever considered. “He’s giving you a stage, but he’s giving you a weapon,” Ewan continued, his voice barely a whisper now. “Every person watching, in that hall or at home, they all live in their own cages. They don't want another royal lullaby. Give them the sound of yours. Play them the fret buzz. Play them the hesitation. Play them the silence between the notes where the real despair lives. Harrington will just hear a sad, slightly amateurish tune. But the people—the ones who know what it’s like to be trapped—they’ll hear the truth. And that, my brother, is a sound no private secretary can ever hope to control.”

Alistair returned to Scone Palace a different man. The dread was still there, a cold stone in his gut, but it was now overlaid with a sliver of diamond-hard resolve. He summoned Lord Harrington to the study the next morning. The secretary entered with his usual air of quiet certainty, expecting the King’s capitulation. Alistair stood by the window, looking out at the manicured grounds. “Harrington,” he said, without turning. “I have considered your proposal for the King’s Harmony Trust. It is an excellent initiative. I formally accept the position as its royal patron.” He paused, then turned to face him. “And I would be honoured to perform at the inaugural gala.” Harrington’s face relaxed into a smile of pure, unadulterated victory. He had done it. He had taken the King’s messy, undignified rebellion and folded it neatly into the institutional fabric. He had won. Alistair let him savour the moment, holding his gaze, his own expression a perfect mask of regal duty.

His practice regimen changed entirely. There was no more need for absolute secrecy, only for a different kind of privacy. Citing the need for a quiet, inspirational space to compose for his new official role, Alistair requested that the West Tower Observatory be unsealed and designated as his personal studio. Harrington, believing this to be a sign of the King’s full commitment to his new, sanctioned hobby, granted the request immediately. The dusty, forgotten room was his once more. But he did not go there to perfect his song. He went there to rediscover its soul. He sat on the simple wooden stool, the Martin guitar feeling like an extension of his own body, and he played ‘The View from the Window’ again and again. He did not try to smooth the rough edges. He leaned into them. He played the slightly clumsy transition to the F chord with all the frustration he had first felt. He let the final note hang in the air with a touch of unresolved melancholy, instead of bringing it to a neat, satisfying close. He was not rehearsing a piece of music; he was memorising a feeling.

The preparations for the gala at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh moved forward with the unstoppable momentum of a state event. It was to be the social and cultural highlight of the season. Alistair sat through meetings on lighting design, broadcast schedules, and seating charts, playing the part of the engaged and benevolent monarch. Harrington was in his element, a grand conductor orchestrating every detail, ensuring the entire event would reflect the dignity and stability of the Crown. As a final, subtle assertion of control, he arranged for a world-renowned classical guitarist to be flown in from London to offer “discreet tuition” to His Majesty. Alistair, feeling Ewan’s words resonating within him, politely but firmly declined. “Thank you, Harrington,” he had said, “but this performance must be entirely my own. It is, after all, a personal statement.” The refusal was a minor act of defiance, a small crack in the facade of his compliance, and it visibly annoyed the secretary. But Harrington let it pass. The stage was built, the audience was waiting, and the King was walking willingly towards it. The master of the game was confident he had already won. Alistair, meanwhile, was steeling himself for an act of public vulnerability so profound it made his hands tremble. The Trojan Horse was being wheeled towards the gates of the palace, and for the first time, he was ready for the war to begin.The Great Gallery at the Palace of Holyroodhouse was a river of light and sound, a breathtaking spectacle of power and prestige. Chandeliers, each one a constellation of crystal, shed a brilliant, unforgiving light on the assembled guests: government ministers in their severe dark suits, philanthropists dripping with diamonds, and cultural luminaries wearing their fame like an expensive cologne. The air hummed with polite, important conversation, the clinking of champagne flutes, and the almost subliminal whirring of television cameras poised on raised platforms, their red lights glowing like malevolent eyes. Along the walls, the stern, painted faces of a hundred of Alistair’s Scottish ancestors gazed down on the scene, their expressions ranging from dour disapproval to regal indifference. They had presided over battles, treaties, and executions. Now, their descendant was the headline act in a meticulously orchestrated media event designed to launder his private rebellion into a public relations triumph.

Backstage, in a small antechamber hastily converted into a holding room, the noise of the gallery was a distant, muffled roar. The room smelled of old tapestries and fresh anxiety. Alistair sat on a rigid velvet chair, the Martin guitar resting across his knees. It felt both impossibly heavy and disconcertingly light, a vessel containing either his salvation or his ruin. Finn was with him, moving with quiet purpose, checking the tuning of the instrument with a small electronic device, his brow furrowed in concentration. He was no longer just a valet; he had become a roadie, a quartermaster, the sole logistical officer in Alistair’s one-man army. When he was done, he handed the guitar back to the King, his hand brushing Alistair’s for a fleeting second. He said nothing, but his eyes conveyed a message of unwavering, almost reckless loyalty. It was more fortifying than any whispered word of encouragement could ever be.

The door opened, and Lord Harrington entered, a walking monument to victory. He was immaculate in his formal evening wear, his face glowing with a calm, proprietary satisfaction. He looked at Alistair, then at the guitar, and smiled the thin, benevolent smile of a zookeeper observing a prized animal that has finally learned its trick. “Everything in order, Your Majesty?” he asked, his voice smooth as polished marble. “The nation awaits. Remember, just the simple melody. Nothing too… complex. It is a gesture, not a recital. They will be utterly charmed.” The condescension was so profound, so perfectly pitched, it was almost a work of art in itself. Harrington was not just confident; he was luxuriating in his own genius. He had built this stage, written this script, and was now merely waiting for his actor to deliver his lines. He gave a final, approving nod and swept from the room to take his seat in the front row, a position from which to best admire his handiwork.

A stage manager with a headset and a clipboard appeared at the door and gave Alistair a five-minute warning. The sound was swallowed by the roaring in Alistair’s own ears. This was it. The walk from the antechamber to the stage was the longest journey of his life. He emerged from the shadows into a blinding wall of light. The polite hum of the gallery died instantly, replaced by a sudden, absolute silence that was more intimidating than any noise. A single, simple wooden chair and a microphone on a stand sat in the center of a vast, empty space, illuminated by a brilliant white spotlight. It felt less like a stage and more like an execution block. As he walked towards it, clutching the neck of his guitar like a lifeline, he could feel thousands of eyes on him. He sat, the chair unforgivingly hard beneath him. He was a specimen in a jar, a king stripped of his robes, his guards, and his palace, left with nothing but a wooden box and a story to tell.

He adjusted the microphone, the small movement echoing in the cavernous silence. He forced himself to look up, past the blinding glare of the spotlights, into the sea of indistinct, expectant faces. And then he saw him. Standing in the shadows at the very back of the gallery, leaning against a portrait of a grim-faced ancestor, was Ewan. He wasn't wearing a tuxedo; he was in his usual dark, functional clothes, looking utterly out of place and completely at home. He caught Alistair’s eye and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. It wasn't encouragement. It was a dare. *Confess it.* Alistair took a ragged breath that the microphone carried to every corner of the hall. He positioned his fingers on the fretboard, the familiar shapes of the chords a small, solid truth in a universe of illusion. He was no longer King Alistair IV, the symbol. He was Ally, the guitarist, a novice about to play his first, and perhaps last, public gig.

He began to play. The first note was not the clean, bell-like tone the audience had expected. It was the simple, slightly rough sound of a C chord, played on a steel-string acoustic. You could hear the faint scrape of his fingers positioning themselves, the barest hint of a string not perfectly depressed. In the front row, Harrington smiled, his plan unfolding perfectly. The King was playing his little tune. It was quaint. It was charming. It was harmless. The simple, melancholy melody of ‘The View from the Window’ began to unspool into the silent hall, a tune of quiet confinement, of gilded cages and unseen horizons. It was the sound of a long, lonely drive, of watching the world through bulletproof glass.

As the tune progressed, something in the room began to shift. Alistair did not hide his limitations; he offered them as part of the composition. When he reached the difficult F chord, he did not glide over it. He let the audience hear the slight, tense hesitation, the split-second of struggle before the notes rang out, not perfectly, but with the grit of effort. He played the silence Ewan had taught him, letting the space between the phrases hang in the air, full of unspoken words. The song was not a performance. It was a testimony. It was the sound of a man quietly admitting he was lost. And it was in that raw, flawed honesty that the true power of the music began to bloom.

The smile on Lord Harrington’s face froze, then slowly dissolved. His head tilted slightly, his eyes narrowing as he listened, truly listened, for the first time. This was not the charming, sanitized melody he had anticipated. This was something else. This was mournful. This was unresolved. There was a strain of profound sadness in it that was entirely unsuitable for a celebratory gala. He could feel the mood in the room changing, the audience’s polite curiosity deepening into a state of rapt, uneasy attention. This was not the King demonstrating a delightful hobby. This was the King opening a vein on stage. Harrington’s victory was curdling into a disaster in real time. The weapon he had so cleverly designed was being turned against him, firing not a volley of rebellion, but a single, devastating shot of pure, unvarnished truth.

Alistair reached the end of the composition, letting the final, questioning A-minor chord hang in the air. He did not resolve it with a satisfying, final strum. He just let it fade into nothing, a question left unanswered, an echo of the howling void he had carried for so long. For a long, breathless moment, there was nothing. The silence that filled the Great Gallery was absolute, a vacuum so profound it was a physical presence. It was not the silence of polite confusion. It was the silence of people who had just heard something deeply, startlingly true and did not know how to respond. The cameras remained fixed on Alistair, the red lights glowing, broadcasting this deafening silence to the entire nation.

Then, from the back of the hall, came a single, deliberate sound. Not applause. Just one person, clapping. Once. Twice. Three times. It was Ewan, a slow, rhythmic clap that was not an ovation but an affirmation, a sign of solidarity from a fellow artist. The sound broke the spell. A smattering of hesitant applause began near the back, then swelled, growing into a strange, questioning wave that was less a celebration and more a collective acknowledgement. Alistair gave a small, formal bow from his chair, a gesture so ingrained it was automatic. He stood, the guitar feeling impossibly light now, and walked off the stage, leaving the noise and the lights behind him. He stepped back into the shadows of the antechamber, his heart hammering not with fear, but with the terrifying, exhilarating emptiness of a man who has finally said what he needed to say and has no idea what comes next.The silence of the antechamber was absolute, a pocket of stillness carved from the heart of the storm. Alistair leaned against the cool, tapestry-covered wall, his body trembling with the aftershocks of adrenaline. The guitar was still in his hands, but it felt inert now, its job done. Through the heavy oak door, the sound of the applause was a strange, alien thing, a disconnected rumour of the world he had just left. He had stood on the highest parapet of his prison and shouted his secret to the wind, and now, in the quiet that followed, he felt an exhilarating and terrifying sense of weightlessness, as if he had just stepped off the edge.

Finn entered the room, closing the door softly behind him, shutting out the last vestiges of the gallery’s noise. He did not speak, but moved to a small side table and poured a glass of water from a crystal carafe, his hands perfectly steady. He brought it to Alistair. Their eyes met over the rim of the glass. The valet’s face, usually a mask of professional deference, was completely open, his expression one of profound, unvarnished awe. “They heard you, sire,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. It was not a compliment. It was a statement of fact, a confirmation that the signal had been received. Alistair took the glass, his own hand shaking so much that the water trembled, threatening to spill. He drank, the cool liquid a shock to his system. He had been heard. The thought was both a comfort and a terror.

The door opened again, this time with a sharp, definite click that cut through the air. Lord Harrington stood on the threshold, his face a bloodless landscape of fury. The controlled satisfaction he had worn like a medal just minutes before had been vaporized, leaving behind the hard, unforgiving granite of his true nature. He did not raise his voice. He did not need to. He stepped into the room and closed the door with the same chilling finality, dismissing Finn with a single, lethal glance. The valet gave a fractional bow and vanished, leaving the two men alone in the suddenly claustrophobic space. Harrington did not move towards Alistair. He stood by the door, his posture rigid, his hands clasped behind his back, a prosecutor about to address a prisoner in the dock.

“What, in the name of God,” he began, his voice a low, vibrating hum of rage, “was that?”

Alistair found his voice, surprised at its steadiness. “That was the truth, Harrington. A concept which I’m sure seems rather quaint from your vantage point.”

A flicker of something dangerous danced in Harrington’s eyes. “The truth? You call that exhibition of adolescent melancholy the truth? Your Majesty, the Crown does not have ‘truths’. It has a purpose. It has a function. And you have just taken a sledgehammer to its primary mechanism.” He took a slow, deliberate step forward, his shoes silent on the thick carpet. “You think you were being honest? You were being indulgent. You think you connected with them? You have destabilized them. You did not give them a song, you gave them a symptom. You have replaced a symbol of steadfast strength with one of neurotic frailty. Do you have any idea what you have done?”

“I played a piece of music,” Alistair said, straightening up from the wall, the guitar still held in his hand like a shield.

“You broadcast a vulnerability from the highest office in the land!” Harrington’s voice rose, cracking the veneer of his control for the first time. “You have turned the monarchy into a patient. You have invited the world to take your pulse, to analyse your moods, to speculate on your mental fitness. And they will. Oh, they will. The papers tomorrow will not speak of your strength. They will speak of your sadness. They will not see a king; they will see a case study. And in doing so, you have made every decision you make, every bill you sign, every treaty you endorse, subject to the question of your emotional stability. You have single-handedly endangered the continuity of the monarchy for a moment of personal, therapeutic catharsis.” He was close now, his face just feet from Alistair’s, his eyes burning with a cold, intellectual fire. He had dissected Alistair’s performance and laid its consequences bare with surgical precision. He had taken Alistair’s moment of liberation and reframed it as an act of catastrophic self-harm.

Defeated, Alistair sank back onto the velvet chair, the weight of Harrington’s words more crushing than any schedule. He had seen the performance as a confession of the soul; Harrington had seen it as treason against the symbol. And in the cold, hard world they both inhabited, he knew the secretary was right. “So what now, Harrington?” he murmured, staring at his own hands, the calluses suddenly feeling foolish and naive. “Do you have me declared unfit? A regency? Perhaps you can rule in my stead. I’m sure you have a proposal for that already drafted.”

Harrington’s expression shifted, the hot rage receding, replaced by something far colder. He took a step back, resuming his professional distance. “Do not be dramatic, sire. That would be messy, and I detest mess.” He straightened his waistcoat, the simple action a reassertion of his authority, of order being restored. “No. The narrative has been damaged, but it can be managed. A new one must be written, immediately. You are not unwell, you are… sensitive. An artist-king. But artists are notoriously volatile. They require structure. They require support for their own good.” The new cage was being constructed right there in the room, its bars forged from concern and compassion. “Effective tomorrow, your public schedule will be significantly reduced. For your health. You need rest. Time for quiet contemplation.” He paused, letting the implication sink in. “And I will be arranging for a small, discreet team of advisors to be brought in. Medical professionals. To help you manage the… pressures of your unique position.”

The words were a death sentence. Minders. Handlers. A team of experts whose job it would be to manage the King’s delicate sensibilities, to keep his artistic temperament from ever again threatening the stability of the institution. He would be a prisoner in a sanatorium of his own making, his every mood charted, his every action interpreted through a clinical lens. Harrington had not just won; he had escalated the war to a level Alistair could never have imagined. He had taken Alistair's truth and diagnosed it as a disease, and now he was going to cure him, whether he wanted to be or not.The door closed, and the silence Harrington left behind was a physical entity, a smothering blanket of absolute defeat. Alistair remained on the chair, the guitar lying across his lap like a fallen comrade. He stared at the intricate wood grain of the Martin, the beautiful thing that had started all of this, and saw for the first time how Harrington saw it: not as a key, but as a child’s toy, a foolish, dangerous indulgence. The secretary’s words had been a masterstroke of psychological destruction. He had taken Alistair’s one authentic act and pathologized it, turning his search for freedom into a diagnosis of instability. The praise from the audience, the approving headlines—they were all meaningless now, just evidence for the prosecution, proof that he had behaved erratically, that he needed to be managed for his own good. The cage Harrington was building was the most perfect prison of all, because its walls would be constructed of care and its guards would be healers.

He sat there for what felt like hours as the last of the gala attendees departed and the palace settled into its deep, historic slumber. He felt the cold seep into his bones, a familiar chill he now understood was not just ennui but the frost of a slow-moving doom. He thought of the coming days. The quiet, sympathetic men in bespoke suits who would ask him how he was feeling. The gentle suggestions for rest, the carefully managed diet, the gradual removal of anything that might cause him ‘agitation’. His guitar would be the first thing to go, taken away with a sad, understanding smile as a source of undue stress. They would cure him of his own soul. He looked up, his gaze falling on a full-length portrait of his father, a man who had withered away in plain sight, his face growing more vacant with every passing year, a man who had died of terminal duty. Alistair knew, with a certainty that was as absolute as a law of physics, that he would not suffer the same fate. A wild, desperate clarity cut through his despair. Harrington’s diagnosis was only valid so long as the patient remained in the asylum.

The decision, when it came, was not a product of logic or strategy, but of a primal, animal instinct to survive. It was the decision of a fox chewing off its own leg to escape a trap. He would not be a patient. He would not be managed. He would not be cured. He would simply cease to be. He laid the guitar gently in its case and stood up, his movements now imbued with a frantic, crystalline purpose. He strode to his private writing desk and took a single sheet of heavy, cream-coloured parchment, the kind reserved for official correspondence. He dipped a fountain pen into a pot of black ink, but he did not write a letter of abdication. He did not write a proclamation or a decree. He simply drew three chords, sketching the finger placements with the care of a cartographer mapping a new world: C, G, A minor. It was not a message for Harrington or for the government. It was a message for Ewan, a final farewell in the only language they now truly shared. He folded it, sealed it with a drop of plain wax, leaving no royal impression, and then he summoned the only man in the entire kingdom he knew he could trust.

Finn arrived in minutes, his face a carefully composed mask that could not quite hide the alarm in his eyes. He had clearly been briefed by a triumphant Harrington, ordered to keep a close watch on the King’s 'fragile' state. Alistair met his gaze, dispensing with all pretense. “He is going to have me committed, Finn,” he said, his voice low and urgent. “Not to a hospital, but to a life of medicated, supervised irrelevance. They are coming for me in the morning, a team of them. I will not be here when they arrive.” The valet’s professional mask shattered, replaced by an expression of pure, unadulterated shock, which quickly hardened into grim understanding. He had seen the slow, systematic crushing of the King’s spirit up close, and he knew this was the final, brutal move. “What does Your Majesty require?” he asked, the formal address now sounding less like deference and more like a pledge of allegiance to the man, not the office. Alistair handed him the sealed note. “This is for my brother. It must get to him tonight. Use one of the off-duty grooms, someone you trust, someone who can ride without being noticed. And then,” Alistair took a deep breath, “I need a way out. A way out that no one will ever find.”

Finn did not hesitate. His mind, so accustomed to the intricate, invisible logistics of the palace, immediately began working on the greatest logistical challenge of his life. “The laundry,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “The vans from the contractor arrive before dawn. They take the linen from the state banquets. They are waved through the rear service gate with only a cursory check. The drivers are changed weekly; no one knows them. If you were in the back…” He trailed off, the insane audacity of the plan hanging in the air between them. It was perfect. Mundane, invisible, and utterly beneath the notice of the palace’s grand security apparatus. “I can get you a set of work clothes. Boiler suit, work boots. You’ll be a ghost. No one will see a king.” Alistair nodded, a surge of wild hope warring with his terror. “What do I take?” he asked, looking around the opulent room, a treasure-filled tomb. Finn’s gaze fell upon the guitar case. “Only what you can’t live without, sire,” he replied.

The final hours were a blur of silent, frantic activity. Alistair stripped off his formal evening wear, the clothes of the King, and left them in a heap on the floor. He changed into the rough, shapeless boiler suit Finn had procured, the coarse fabric scratching against his soft skin. It felt like a baptism. He looked at his reflection in the grand rococo mirror—a stranger, a workman, a nobody. He walked through his private apartments, a ghost in his own life, leaving everything behind. The priceless watches, the antique cufflinks, the rows of handmade shoes, the signet ring on his desk that bore the weight of his lineage. He touched none of it. He was shedding a skin, layer by layer. Finally, he picked up the guitar case. It was the only thing that felt real, the only part of his identity he had truly earned. Finn met him at a discreet service door, his face pale in the pre-dawn gloom. “The van is by the kitchens. The driver has been… delayed for five minutes. It’s all the time you have.”

They moved like fugitives through the silent, sleeping arteries of the palace. The service corridors, usually bustling with staff, were empty and echoing, smelling of stale air and disinfectant. Every distant clang of a pipe, every hum of a generator, sounded like an alarm. As they crossed a small, darkened courtyard, the first hint of grey light was beginning to stain the eastern sky. The laundry van stood waiting, a large, anonymous white box, its rear doors slightly ajar. Just as Alistair reached for the handle, the sound of a powerful engine broke the morning silence. A sleek, black saloon car with tinted windows swept silently through the palace’s main gates, its headlights cutting a swathe through the dawn mist. Alistair froze, his heart seizing in his chest. The medical team. They had arrived. “Go,” Finn hissed, shoving him towards the van. “Now, sire!” Alistair scrambled into the dark, cavernous interior, landing amongst vast, heavy canvas bags filled with the starched white linen of his former life. The air was thick with the scent of lavender and bleach. Finn slammed the heavy doors shut, plunging him into absolute darkness. A second later, he heard the metallic click of the bolt, and then the sound of Finn’s footsteps, walking briskly, professionally away. He was alone, a king in a box, buried alive in his own laundry. The van’s engine rumbled to life, and with a lurch, it began to move. He felt it bump over the cobblestones, turn, and then accelerate, the sound of the palace walls receding behind him. He felt the heavy crunch as the tyres rolled over the cattle grid at the service gate. He was out. He was free. In the suffocating, lavender-scented darkness, Alistair IV, King of the smallest and most ceremonial monarchy in the United Kingdom, laid his head back against a bag of dirty tablecloths and began to laugh, a silent, sobbing laugh of pure, terrified, and triumphant freedom.The laughter died in his throat, replaced by the jarring reality of his situation. He was a piece of cargo, tossed and jolted with every pothole and turn in the road. The darkness was absolute, a thick, smothering blackness that smelled of industrial cleaning agents and the faint, human scent of sweat on starched cotton. He was encased in a metal box, a rolling tomb, and for a wild, panicked moment, he felt the walls closing in, a more literal and terrifying cage than any he had known before. He pressed a hand against the shifting mountain of laundry bags to steady himself, the rough canvas a grounding, tactile anchor in the disorienting void. He focused on the rhythm of the road, the hum of the engine, the squeak of the suspension. These were the sounds of escape. This was the sound of his new life beginning. He had no idea where he was going, only that he was moving away, with every revolution of the wheels, from the man he had been.

The journey seemed to last an eternity, a lifetime spent in the rumbling dark. When the van finally slowed, its brakes hissing, and lurched to a halt, the sudden silence was as jarring as a gunshot. Alistair’s heart hammered against his ribs. He heard the metallic clang of the driver’s door opening and shutting, then footsteps receding on gravel. A moment later, a loud, scraping sound echoed through the van as a heavy industrial door was rolled open somewhere nearby. He strained his ears, trying to build a picture of the world outside. He heard the murmur of voices, the clang of metal on concrete, the distant roar of what might have been a furnace. This was it. He shifted into a crouch, pulling the guitar case tight against his chest, his knuckles white. The bolt on the rear doors scraped back with a sound like tearing metal, and a rectangle of harsh, grey morning light blinded him.

He squeezed his eyes shut, then blinked them open, his vision swimming. A man in a dirty blue boiler suit, his back to Alistair, was silhouetted against the opening. The man grunted as he grabbed the edge of a heavy canvas bag and began to drag it out of the van. Alistair held his breath, pressing himself into the corner behind a mountain of linen, praying the deep shadows would hold him. The man heaved one bag out, then another. He paused, wiping his brow with the back of a greasy hand, and turned to shout something to a colleague Alistair couldn’t see. It was the moment. Now or never. As the worker turned his back again to grab a third bag, Alistair moved. He slid over the remaining laundry, his own boiler suit blending into the chaos, and dropped silently from the back of the van onto the grimy concrete floor. He landed with a soft thud, his knees jarring from the impact, and scrambled behind a stack of empty metal trolleys, his heart threatening to burst from his chest. He had not been seen.

From his hiding place, he watched as the van was emptied. He was in a vast, cavernous warehouse. The air was thick with steam and the chemical smell of detergent, and the noise was deafening—a symphony of industrial washers and dryers, the hiss of steam presses, and the shouts of workers. It was a world of relentless, purposeful motion, a world utterly devoid of ceremony or silence. Men and women moved with an economy of effort born of long, hard days, their faces set in expressions of weary concentration. Alistair, the man whose entire life had been a series of carefully orchestrated pauses, was now an invisible ghost in a hurricane of labour. He felt a profound sense of dislocation, as if he had stepped through a mirror into a reality that was the stark, unvarnished negative of his own. He was nothing here. He was nobody. The thought was both terrifying and intoxicating.

Meanwhile, back at Scone Palace, the measured, predictable rhythm of the morning had shattered. Lord Harrington stood in the centre of the King’s empty bedroom, his face a mask of glacial fury. The immaculate bed had not been slept in. The formal evening wear lay on the floor in a heap, a discarded skin. The valet, Finn, when summoned, had presented a face of perfect, panicked ignorance that Harrington knew, with the certainty of a zealot, was a lie. The arrival of the "medical team" had been met with a polite, impenetrable wall of confusion from the household staff. The King, they were told, had retired early and left explicit instructions not to be disturbed. It was a beautifully orchestrated deception, and Harrington could almost admire its audacity, were he not at the epicentre of its catastrophic fallout. A silent, frantic search of the palace and grounds had yielded nothing. The King of the United Kingdom’s smallest monarchy had vanished.

Harrington’s mind worked with the cold, terrifying speed of a supercomputer calculating a cascading failure. A public announcement was unthinkable. It would be an admission of a complete breakdown of security and control, an open invitation to every conspiracy theorist and constitutional anarchist. The narrative had to be seized, immediately. He made two calls on a secure line. The first was to the head of the royal protection squad in London, initiating a level-one, clandestine search protocol. There would be no police, no press. Just a handful of the most discreet, most senior intelligence officers in the country, men who moved in shadows and did not officially exist. The second call was to Ewan. It was a long shot, a calculated risk, but Harrington knew that if the King had acted irrationally, he would have reached out to the one other irrational element in his life. The conversation was brief and arctic. Ewan had denied everything, his voice dripping with a lazy, insolent sarcasm that only confirmed Harrington’s suspicion. He knew. The hunt had its first scent.

Unaware of the silent, high-stakes dragnet beginning to close around him, Alistair waited for his moment. When the morning shift-change whistle blew, a piercing shriek that momentarily silenced the machinery, he saw his chance. He joined a small stream of workers heading for a side exit, keeping his head down, his body angled to conceal the guitar case as much as possible. No one gave him a second glance. He was just another faceless body in a worn-out boiler suit, trudging towards the end of a shift. He stepped out of the factory’s oppressive heat and into the raw, damp air of a Scottish morning. He was in a bleak industrial estate, a grey landscape of corrugated iron, chain-link fences, and rain-slicked asphalt. He had no money, no phone, no map, and no plan. His only possession was a ridiculously expensive acoustic guitar. For the first time, he felt the true, bone-deep chill of his freedom. He looked left, then right, at the identical, featureless roads stretching into the morning mist. He chose a direction at random and began to walk, the weight of the guitar case in his hand the only familiar thing in a world made terrifyingly, beautifully new.The walk was a lesson in attrition. Alistair trudged through the grey labyrinth of the industrial estate, each step a small, painful negotiation with the unfamiliar terrain. The borrowed work boots, a size too large, rubbed against his heels, and the rough seams of the boiler suit chafed his neck. Every muscle in his arm and shoulder ached from the weight of the guitar case, a dead, cumbersome anchor that advertised a value he no longer possessed. The world, which he had only ever experienced through the hermetic seal of a limousine window, now assaulted him with a barrage of raw, unfiltered sensations. The acrid smell of diesel fumes from a passing lorry, the damp chill that seeped through his clothes, the percussive clang of a distant forge—it was a brutal, chaotic symphony, and he was utterly lost in it.

He eventually emerged from the industrial park onto a main road, a noisy artery clogged with traffic. Cars rushed past, their occupants faceless blurs, each one on a journey with a destination and a purpose, two luxuries he no longer had. He saw a bus shelter, its plexiglass panels scarred with graffiti, a timetable flapping in the damp breeze. He watched as a woman with a pram and a weary expression fed a handful of coins into a slot on the bus when it arrived. The simple, transactional nature of the act was a revelation. He had spent his entire life as the face on the currency, yet had never truly understood its fundamental power. He possessed nothing of value to the bus driver, no means to purchase a ticket to anywhere. He was static, a man outside the current of commerce and society, and the realization was a colder shock than the morning air. He turned away from the road and kept walking, following the path of least resistance towards what looked like the centre of the town.

Hunger, an abstract concept he had only ever read about, began to assert itself as a physical, malevolent presence. It was a dull, hollow ache behind his sternum that slowly sharpened into a painful, insistent gnawing. He passed a small bakery, and the warm, impossibly sweet smell of baking bread and pastries billowed out, enveloping him in a cloud of agonizing temptation. He saw people inside, laughing, drinking coffee, casually consuming more calories in a single croissant than he had ingested in the last eighteen hours. He felt a surge of something hot and bitter: not anger, but a profound, alienating shame. He was a ghost looking into the world of the living, separated by an invisible wall of his own making. He hurried past, his stomach clenching in a painful, empty knot.

He found himself in a small, tired-looking public park. A few sad-looking rose bushes, a patch of damp grass, and a handful of benches occupied by pensioners feeding pigeons. It was here, sitting on a cold, wet bench, that he finally confronted the object in his hand. He laid the guitar case flat and unclipped the latches. The Martin lay nestled in its velvet cocoon, a ridiculously beautiful, aristocratic thing in this drab, municipal setting. It was his only asset and his greatest vulnerability. The busker on the bridge, the children in Glasgow—they had all played for a reason, for connection, for joy, for money. Now, it was his turn. The romantic notion of being a street musician evaporated in the face of raw, desperate necessity. This was not an act of artistic expression. It was begging, with an instrument.

He chose a spot near a covered walkway that offered some shelter from the persistent drizzle, a place where people might pass without feeling cornered. His hands trembled so violently he could barely lift the guitar from its case. He placed the open case on the ground in front of him, the black velvet lining looking like a small, waiting void. His heart hammered against his ribs. This felt more exposing, more terrifying, than standing on the stage at Holyroodhouse. There, he had been a King performing an act of rebellion. Here, he was a nobody performing an act of survival. He took a breath, the cold air burning his lungs, and placed his clumsy, trembling fingers on the fretboard. He didn't play his own tune. He couldn't. It was too raw, too close to the man he had just killed. Instead, he fumbled through the chords of ‘Wild Mountain Thyme’, the simple folk song his nanny had sung to him, a melody from a life so distant it felt like it belonged to someone else.

The sound that emerged was thin and pathetic, a whisper of music swallowed by the indifferent noise of the town. His fingers were stiff with cold and fear, and the notes buzzed and choked. He kept his eyes fixed on the fretboard, unable to look up, unable to meet the gaze of the people he could hear walking past. He felt their disinterest as a physical force, a wave of apathy that washed over him and left him feeling smaller, more invisible than ever. He played the song again, then again, a desperate, repeating loop of faltering chords. No one stopped. No one even slowed down. He was just another piece of urban scenery, a flicker of motion at the edge of their vision, easily dismissed and instantly forgotten. The shame he had felt outside the bakery returned, intensified, threatening to overwhelm him. He was a failure at this, too. His great escape had lasted less than a day and had ended here, playing badly to an audience of pigeons on a wet Tuesday morning.

Just as he was about to give up, to pack the guitar away and surrender to the creeping despair, he heard it. It was a sound so small it was almost lost in the ambient noise, but to Alistair, it was as loud as a thunderclap. A soft, metallic clink. He risked a glance downwards. There, in the black velvet emptiness of his guitar case, lay a single, gleaming one-pound coin. He looked up, his eyes wide with shock, and saw a woman, elderly and frail, wrapped in a thick woollen coat, walking slowly away. She did not look back. She had not been judging his performance or assessing his skill. She had simply seen a man who looked cold and lost and had performed a small, anonymous act of kindness. He stared at the coin, a perfect, golden circle of light in the darkness of the case. It wasn't a donation. It wasn't patronage. It was an earning. He had created something, however flawed, and the world had answered, however small. He picked up the coin, its metallic weight solid and real in his palm. It was the first piece of money he had ever truly earned in his entire life. A single tear, hot and unexpected, traced a path down his cold cheek. He pocketed the coin, took a deep, shuddering breath, and began to play again, his fingers a little surer this time, the notes ringing out with a new, fragile clarity.That single, heavy coin became the centre of his universe. He held it tightly in his pocket, the raised edges of the Queen’s profile a strange and bitter irony he could feel through the rough fabric of his trousers. It was an anchor, a proof of concept, a tangible link between his effort and his existence. The gnawing hunger in his belly was no longer a form of abstract suffering; it was a problem to be solved, and he now possessed the precise tool for its solution. With a new, fragile sense of purpose, he packed the guitar away and walked back towards the main street, his posture a fraction straighter, his steps less a shuffle and more a deliberate stride. The town, which had seemed so hostile and alien just an hour before, now looked different. It was a landscape of possibilities, a network of doors he could now, perhaps, open.

He found what he was looking for on a side street: a small, steamy cafe with condensation fogging the lower half of its large front window. The sign above, in faded red letters, simply read ‘The Kettle’. It was not a place he would have ever noticed before, let alone entered. It was a place for ordinary people living ordinary lives, a world away from the silent, gilded dining rooms of his past. He pushed the door open, a small bell tinkling brightly above his head, and was met with a wall of warm air thick with the smell of frying bacon, strong tea, and damp wool. A handful of patrons—workmen in dusty overalls, an elderly couple reading a newspaper—glanced up at him, their gazes lingering for a moment on the bulky guitar case, before dismissing him and returning to their conversations. He was an anomaly, but not an alarming one.

A woman with a tired, kind face and flour dusting her apron stood behind a counter laden with buns, pies, and plates of scones. “What can I get you, hen?” she asked, her voice weary but gentle. Alistair’s own voice, when he tried to use it, felt rusty and foreign. “A… a cup of tea, please,” he managed, the words feeling clumsy in his mouth. “And one of those.” He pointed to a simple, unadorned bread roll in a wire basket. The woman nodded, turning to pour steaming water from a large metal urn into a thick ceramic mug. “That’ll be one pound and eighty pence,” she said, placing the tea and the roll on the counter. His heart sank. He had miscalculated. He had only a single pound. The flush of shame was immediate and overwhelming. He fumbled in his pocket, his hand closing around the solitary coin. “I… I only have…” he began, his voice trailing off into a mortified whisper.

Before he could finish, the man sitting at the counter beside him, a burly figure in a high-visibility jacket, reached into his own pocket without looking up from his paper. He slid a pound coin across the worn formica surface. “Just get him the tea, Mary,” he grunted. “I’ll cover the rest.” The woman swept both coins into the till without comment, as if this small, casual act of grace were the most normal thing in the world. She pushed the mug and the roll towards Alistair. “There you are, love. Help yourself to milk and sugar.” Stunned into silence, Alistair could only nod his thanks to the man, who merely grunted again in acknowledgement, never taking his eyes from the sports page. Alistair took his meagre feast to a small, wobbly table in the corner, his hands shaking. He sat and stared at the steaming mug and the plain white roll. It was the most magnificent meal he had ever seen. He took a sip of the tea, scaldingly hot and bracingly strong, and felt the warmth spread through his chest, chasing away the bone-deep chill. He broke the bread roll, its texture dense and substantial, and ate it slowly, savouring every plain, life-giving crumb. It was more satisfying than any of the thousand elaborate, multi-course banquets he had presided over. In this small, greasy cafe, through the anonymous generosity of a stranger, he had received his first lesson in the unwritten social contract of this new world, a world where dignity was not an entitlement of birth, but a small, fragile thing shared between people who had little else to give.

Meanwhile, in a windowless room deep within the secure government buildings of central London, Lord Harrington stared at a wall of glowing screens. The room was cold, the air scrubbed clean and recycled, a perfect hermetic environment for the surgical dissection of a crisis. This was the headquarters of the Clandestine Retrieval Unit, a branch of the intelligence services so secret that even its name was a fiction. Here, there were no uniforms, only quiet, intense men and women in unassuming clothes who moved with a preternatural calm and spoke in acronyms. Harrington, in his perfectly tailored suit, was the only civilian present, an alien element tolerated only because the asset they were hunting belonged to him. The unit’s director, a man known only as ‘Cromwell’, stood beside him, pointing at a large digital map of central Scotland peppered with red and green icons.

“He has no digital footprint, my lord,” Cromwell said, his voice a flat, toneless instrument of fact. “No mobile phone, no credit cards, no travel documents. The subject has gone entirely analogue. In the 21st century, that is the most effective form of invisibility.” On the screen, they watched the tracked movements of Ewan’s mobile phone, a green dot moving erratically between his Edinburgh studio, various pubs, and an art supply shop. “The step-brother’s pattern is unchanged. If he knows anything, he is playing his part superbly. We have him under physical surveillance, of course, but so far, nothing.” Harrington’s gaze was fixed on a financial transaction report. The one-pound coin spent by the anonymous construction worker in a cafe had not registered on any system, a transaction too small and too human to be tracked. The King had vanished into the statistical noise of everyday life. “He is a creature of habit, of comfort,” Harrington said, his voice thin with suppressed rage. “He cannot survive long without his patterns. He will seek shelter. He will need money. We must monitor the lowest levels of the system. Hostels, shelters, pawn shops. He has an asset. A high-value acoustic guitar.” Cromwell nodded, turning to one of his analysts. “Flag all transactions involving musical instruments in a fifty-mile radius of his last known position. Use the arts and antiques database. Cross-reference with police pawnshop logs. I want to know if a Martin guitar so much as breathes in Scotland.” The net, invisible and woven from data, was being cast wider, its mesh growing finer.

Back in the anonymous town, Alistair returned to his spot under the covered walkway. The single cup of tea and the bread roll had armed him with a new resolve. The desperate, gnawing hunger had been replaced by a low, steady burn of purpose. He was no longer playing out of sheer terror, but with a plan. He needed to earn enough for a room. The thought of spending a night on the street, of succumbing to the cold and the dark, was a fear so profound it eclipsed his shame. He took the Martin from its case, the instrument feeling less like a burden now and more like a tool, a necessary extension of his will to survive. He began to play again, his repertoire still limited to the simple folk tunes of his childhood, but his fingers were more nimble now, his confidence bolstered by the small victory of his morning meal. He focused on the music, trying to pour into it not his despair, but a quiet, pleading dignity. He played for two solid hours, the melodies becoming a kind of meditation, a repeating prayer against the encroaching afternoon chill. The coins appeared slowly, sporadically. A twenty-pence piece from a teenage boy who looked as surprised by his own generosity as Alistair was. A fifty-pence piece dropped by a hurried businesswoman who didn’t break her stride. Each clink of metal in the velvet-lined case was a small miracle, a confirmation that he was not entirely invisible.

He was so engrossed in his task that he didn’t notice the man watching him. The man had been standing fifty feet away for the better part of an hour, leaning against a pillar, half-hidden in the afternoon shadows. He was old, with a face like a crumpled map of the Highlands and a wild thatch of white hair that escaped from under a worn tweed cap. Cradled in his arms was a battered fiddle case, its leather peeling and scarred with the marks of a long, hard life on the road. When Alistair finally paused, his fingers aching and numb with cold, the old man pushed himself off the pillar and ambled over. He stopped in front of Alistair, his pale blue eyes assessing the expensive guitar, the clean, though ill-fitting, boiler suit, and the soft, unweathered hands of the player. He grunted, a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sigh. “You’re holding it like it’s a priceless antique you’re terrified of dropping,” the old man said, his voice a gravelly Glaswegian rasp. “It’s a tool, son. A hammer. You use it to build a tune. Stop being so bloody polite with it.” Alistair stared at him, taken aback by the blunt appraisal. The old man gestured with his chin towards the velvet-lined case, where a small handful of coins lay scattered like lost change. “And lose that thing. It’s a coffin. You’re putting your music in a coffin and asking people to pay for the funeral. Looks like you’re packing up to leave before you’ve even started. Puts people off.” He reached into his own pocket and pulled out a dented tin flask, unscrewing the cap. “Here,” he said, offering it. “You look like you could use a bit of central heating.” The flask smelled powerfully of cheap, potent whisky. Alistair, the man who had a cellar filled with priceless single malts, hesitated for only a second before taking it and swallowing a grateful, burning mouthful. The old man nodded in approval. “The name’s Murdo,” he said. “And you, son, are going about this all wrong.”The raw, fiery spirit coursed through Alistair’s veins, a brutal and welcome warmth that momentarily banished the chill of the afternoon. He stared at the old man, Murdo, whose words had been as shockingly direct as the whisky. For his entire adult life, every object he touched, every word he spoke, was freighted with symbolic weight. His hands were for signing treaties, his voice for delivering speeches. Murdo’s pronouncement that his priceless, custom-made guitar was nothing more than a hammer—a tool to be used, not revered—was a philosophy so revolutionary it bordered on heresy. Alistair looked from the old man’s battered fiddle case to the pristine, velvet-lined coffin of his own instrument, and for the first time, he saw the truth of the criticism. He had been performing his poverty, not trying to escape it.

“Right then,” Murdo grunted, seeming to take Alistair’s stunned silence as acquiescence. “Lesson one. Put that fancy box down and watch.” He ambled over to the bench, retrieved his fiddle case, and opened it with a familiar, fluid motion. The instrument inside was a reflection of its owner. The varnish was worn away in patches where decades of hands and chins had rested, the wood was scarred and dented, and one of the tuning pegs was a crudely carved, non-matching piece of dark wood. It was not an object of beauty; it was an object of immense character, a repository of a thousand smoky pubs, rainy street corners, and late-night ceilidhs. Murdo tucked it under his chin, his posture changing instantly. He straightened up, a spark of life igniting in his pale eyes, transforming him from a shuffling old man into a custodian of something ancient and vital.

Without a word of introduction, he drew his bow across the strings, and the air split open. It was not a sad, pleading folk song. It was a reel, a furious, life-affirming cascade of notes that seemed to grab the grey, damp afternoon by the scruff of the neck and demand that it dance. The music was not technically flawless; there were scrapes and dissonances, moments where the tune almost ran away from him. But it was alive. It had a heartbeat. Murdo’s foot began to stomp out a rhythm on the wet pavement, a percussive anchor to the fiddle’s wild flight. He was not looking at his fingers or staring at the ground. His eyes were up, scanning the faces of the people passing by, a silent, smiling invitation in his gaze. He was not a supplicant asking for charity; he was a host throwing a party in the middle of the street, and everyone was invited.

The effect was immediate and profound. People who had hurried past Alistair’s mournful playing now slowed, their heads turning towards the source of this infectious, joyful noise. A young mother pushing a pram stopped, a smile breaking across her tired face as she bounced the pram in time with the music. A pair of surly teenagers, hoods up and eyes down, paused, and one of them started recording on his phone, a reluctant grin on his face. An old man leaned on his walking stick, his head nodding along to a rhythm he had known his whole life. The coins that dropped into Murdo’s open, upturned fiddle case were different from the one Alistair had received. They were not given out of pity. They were payments, tips, a shared acknowledgement of a service rendered. Murdo had, for a few brief moments, made the world a little less grey, and people were happy to pay for the privilege.

When the final, triumphant note of the reel died away, a smattering of genuine applause followed. Murdo gave a theatrical, slightly mocking bow, his eyes twinkling. He had earned more in five minutes than Alistair had in two hours. He ambled back over to the bench where Alistair sat, utterly humbled. “See?” Murdo said, pocketing the handful of coins. “You were selling sadness. It’s a drug on the market. I’m selling a holiday. Ten seconds of not thinking about your bills or your bad back. Always in demand.” He jerked his chin at Alistair’s guitar case. “Now, get that thing out of sight. It’s bad for business. Looks like you’re about to flit.” He took off his own worn tweed cap and tossed it onto the ground. “Use that. It’s a collection plate, not a grave.”

Humbled and obedient, Alistair put his guitar case behind the bench, out of sight. The simple act felt significant, a severing of his last tie to the preciousness of his old life. He placed the tweed cap on the ground, its worn, empty interior a far more honest and vulnerable receptacle than the plush velvet had ever been. “Right,” Murdo said, a new, business-like tone in his voice. “Fiddle’s good for the high notes, but it needs a bit of body underneath. You can play a G, a C, and a D, can’t you?” Alistair, the man who had agonised over the subtle voicings of an A-minor chord, simply nodded. “Good enough. I’ll lead, you follow. Just watch my foot. Keep a steady rhythm. Don’t try to be clever. Your job is to be the floorboards. My job is to dance on them. We’ll split it seventy-thirty till you can keep up. Then we’ll talk.”

And so, Alistair’s apprenticeship began. Murdo launched into another tune, a slower, more stately strathspey this time, nodding his head to indicate the chord changes. Alistair, his focus narrowed to a laser point, watched the old man’s stomping foot and tried to provide a simple, rhythmic pulse. His playing was clumsy, his changes hesitant. He was concentrating so hard he felt a sheen of sweat break out on his brow despite the cold. But the sound they made together was immediately fuller, richer. The soaring, melancholic voice of the fiddle was now grounded by the warm, percussive strum of the guitar. They were a band, however rudimentary. The music they made was a conversation, a story with two voices. And the cap on the ground began to fill with the steady, miraculous rain of silver and copper.

In his cold London command centre, Lord Harrington stared at a new report on the screen. The arts and antiques database had been cross-referenced with regional sales and auction house manifests. Cromwell pointed to a highlighted entry. “We have a potential flag, my lord. A Martin D-45. Considered a high-value instrument. It was sold by a private collector in Perth two days ago to an undisclosed buyer in Glasgow. The timing is… suggestive.” Harrington felt a surge of cold, predatory excitement. It was a thread. “Find the buyer,” he commanded, his voice a low hiss. “I don’t care what it takes. I want a name. I want an address. Turn the city of Glasgow upside down.” He was a master hunter, and he could feel the faint spoor of his quarry on the digital wind. The net was tightening.

As dusk began to settle, painting the sky in bruised shades of purple and orange, Murdo called a halt. He counted the day’s earnings, a respectable pile of coins, and handed a small share to Alistair. It was more than he could have dreamed of earning on his own. “Right, that’s enough for a roof and a dram,” the old man declared. “Time to go home.” He led Alistair away from the town centre, through a darkening labyrinth of narrow, cobbled backstreets that grew progressively more derelict. The air grew thick with the smell of damp brickwork, coal smoke, and frying onions. Alistair, clutching his guitar, followed his new mentor like a child, utterly dependent on his guidance.

They stopped in front of a looming, soot-stained tenement building, its sandstone blackened by a century of industrial grime. A single, bare lightbulb above a heavily graffitied door cast a sickly yellow light on the broken pavement. Murdo pushed the door open—the lock had been broken for years—and led the way into a dark, echoing stairwell. They climbed three flights of worn stone steps, the air growing colder and damper with each floor, the smell of boiled cabbage and disinfectant becoming overwhelming. Murdo stopped at a door at the end of a long, dark corridor, its green paint peeling in long, leprous strips. He fumbled with a set of keys, found the right one, and turned it in the lock. The sound of the bolt drawing back was loud and abrasive in the echoing silence.

Murdo pushed the door open and flicked a switch. A single, naked bulb flickered to life, revealing the room that was his home. It was a space no larger than the walk-in wardrobe where Alistair had hidden his guitar. There was a narrow bed shoved against one wall, its blankets a chaotic tangle. A small, formica-topped table was surrounded by two mismatched chairs, and in the corner, a small sink stained with rust sat below a single cold-water tap. The room’s only window was small and grimy, offering a depressing view of a brick wall just a few feet away. It was a scene of profound, grinding poverty, the bleakest, most hopeless space Alistair had ever set foot in. Murdo gestured with his fiddle case. “Pick a bit of floor. The bed’s mine. You’re not a pretty enough lass to be sharing it.” He closed the door, the sound of the bolt sliding home echoing in the tiny room. For the first time in his life, Alistair had a home that he had earned. It was a squalid, one-room flat in a slum, shared with a stranger, but as the bolt locked them in against the cold and the dark of the world outside, it felt, to him, as safe and as welcome as a palace.The concept of sleep had, for Alistair, always been a structured, passive affair. It was something that happened between prescribed hours in a vast, silent bed, a state entered into and departed from with the quiet assistance of valets and blackout curtains. That first night on Murdo’s floor was a brutal re-education. He lay on a thin, lumpy blanket that smelled faintly of dust and old whisky, the hard floorboards pressing into his hips and shoulders. The symphony of the tenement building was relentless: the creak of floorboards from the flat above, the distant, angry shouting of a domestic dispute, the shuddering groan of the building’s ancient plumbing. Every sound was an intrusion, a reminder of the raw, unfiltered proximity of other human lives. Yet, beneath the discomfort and the noise, there was a strange, novel sense of security. The heavy bolt on the door was not just keeping the world out; it was sealing him in. For the first time in his life, no one on earth knew precisely where he was. He was a secret, even to himself, and in that anonymity, he found a ragged, unfamiliar peace.

Their life together quickly settled into a routine, a spartan ritual governed by the weather and the meagre flow of commerce on the street. Mornings began with the scrape of Murdo lighting a small gas ring, the hiss of the flame a summons to the day. Breakfast was strong, stewed tea and dry toast, eaten in near silence at the wobbly formica table. Murdo was not a man for morning conversation; he communicated in grunts and gestures, his energy focused on the day’s primary objective: earning enough to see the night. Alistair learned to read this silent language, to anticipate the need for a fresh mug of tea, to clean their two plates in the rust-stained sink without being asked. He was learning a new kind of duty, one based not on protocol but on the simple, symbiotic needs of two men sharing a space barely large enough for one. He was, he realised with a start one morning, becoming useful.

Their days on the street were a relentless education. Murdo was a harsh, unsentimental tutor, his lessons delivered in short, cutting aphorisms. “Don’t look at your fingers, son. Look at the people. Your fingers know the tune. It’s the people you need to learn.” And Alistair learned. He learned to see the subtle shift in a person’s gait that meant they were in a hurry and not to be engaged. He learned to spot the lonely ones, the people lingering on the edge of the small crowds they gathered, who were hungry not just for a tune but for a moment of shared human experience. He learned that playing loudly wasn’t as important as playing with conviction, and that a shared, conspiratorial smile with Murdo after a particularly good phrase was worth more than a handful of coins. His own body began to change, adapting to the demands of this new life. The soft, pale skin of his fingertips, once merely callused, became thick and tough, ridged with the permanent imprint of the steel strings. A constant ache settled in his lower back from hours spent sitting on cold stone ledges, and the precise, upright posture of a king was slowly giving way to the tired, practical hunch of a street musician.

He was also learning the tunes. Murdo was a walking library of traditional music, each reel, jig, and lament carrying with it a story. “This one,” he’d say, humming a few bars of a mournful air, “this is ‘Hector the Hero’. About a lad from the pipes who went off to the Boer War and never came back. You’ve got to play it like you’re saying goodbye to your best friend at a train station.” Under Murdo’s gruff tutelage, the music ceased to be a mere collection of chords and melodies. It became a language, a way of telling stories of love, loss, work, and war, the shared, unwritten history of the people he now played for. He felt his own song, ‘The View from the Window’, receding in his memory, a sad, simple tune from a different man’s life. It was a song about a cage. These new songs were about the world outside it.

The hierarchy of the street revealed itself slowly. One afternoon, as they were setting up in a particularly lucrative spot near the town’s main market, a young man with a pierced eyebrow and an electric guitar in a gig bag approached them. He didn’t speak, but simply stood there, his arms crossed, his expression a mixture of challenge and contempt. Alistair felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his stomach, but Murdo simply nodded at the newcomer, a gesture of weary acknowledgement. “He’s got an amp, lad,” Murdo muttered to Alistair under his breath. “Different weight class. We’ll take the side street for an hour. No point starting a turf war when you’re outgunned.” It was a lesson in pragmatism, in knowing which battles to fight and which to walk away from. Murdo was a king in this world, his authority derived not from birthright but from decades of accumulated knowledge and the quiet respect of his peers, and Alistair was his non-voting privy council.

Meanwhile, the hunt continued. In the sterile, air-conditioned quiet of the London command centre, Cromwell presented his findings to Lord Harrington. The Martin guitar had been sold by a reputable Perth-based luthier who kept meticulous, if informal, records. He had sold the instrument for cash to a young, tech-savvy man with a London accent who had explicitly asked for the transaction to be kept ‘discreet’. The luthier had found the request odd but had complied. He had, however, jotted down the registration number of the royal fleet vehicle the young man had used, a detail he had noted simply because he was a classic car enthusiast. The registration number was cross-referenced in the royal household’s transport logs. It was the backup car assigned to the King’s valet, Finn.

The net had not just tightened; it had snagged its first catch. Harrington felt a surge of pure, triumphant rage. The valet was the key. He would be broken, his loyalties dismantled piece by piece until he gave up his King. But Cromwell, ever the pragmatist, counselled patience. “If we pull the valet in, my lord, we spook the quarry. He’ll know we’re close. Right now, the subject believes he is invisible. It’s a powerful illusion, and a significant tactical advantage for us. We leave the valet in place, under intense surveillance. He is now our tracker dog. Sooner or later, he will try to make contact. And when he does, we will be waiting.” Harrington, though it chafed against his desire for immediate, decisive action, saw the cold logic in the strategy. He would let his prey enjoy his illusion of freedom a little longer, all the better to savour the moment when the trap finally snapped shut. The game had become more complex, a delicate dance of surveillance and counter-surveillance, and Harrington was a patient, methodical player.

One evening, after a particularly good day had left them with enough money for a fish supper and a cheap bottle of whisky, Murdo and Alistair sat in their small room, the silence comfortable and earned. As Murdo cleaned the rosin from his bow with a tattered cloth, he looked at Alistair, a rare, thoughtful expression on his face. “You’re getting better, son,” he said, the compliment stark and unadorned. “You’re starting to listen. But there’s still something of the museum about you. You play the notes, but you’re afraid to get your hands dirty with them.” He leaned forward, his pale eyes intense. “You never told me your name, and I never asked. Doesn’t matter. But every man’s got a tune inside him, a song that’s his and his alone. Not one he learned, but one he bled. You got one of those?” The question was so direct, so perilously close to the truth, that Alistair froze. He thought of ‘The View from the Window’, the melody of his gilded cage, the song he had played on a national stage. It felt like a lifetime ago. “I did,” Alistair said, his voice quiet. “But I don’t think it’s my tune anymore.” Murdo nodded slowly, accepting the answer without question. “Good,” he said, turning back to his fiddle. “Means there’s room for a new one.” He tucked the instrument under his chin, and in the cramped, squalid room, he began to play a slow, heartbreaking lament that filled the space with a beauty so profound it made Alistair’s chest ache.The bleak, singular focus of survival began, slowly and imperceptibly, to soften at the edges. The daily cycle of earning enough for a roof and a meal, which had at first been a terrifying, all-consuming struggle, started to feel less like a battle and more like a craft. Alistair’s partnership with Murdo evolved from a master-and-apprentice dynamic into a fluid, non-verbal collaboration. On the street, they learned to anticipate each other’s musical whims, a subtle dip of Murdo’s head signalling a key change, a slight increase in the tempo of Alistair’s strumming encouraging the fiddle to take another, wilder chorus. The music they made grew tighter, more intricate, and more joyful, and the worn tweed cap on the pavement reflected their growing synergy. They were no longer just two men playing tunes; they were becoming a single, cohesive sound, a small but vibrant spark of life in the grey town.

Their reputation, such as it was, began to crystallise. They were Murdo and his shadow, the old fiddler and the quiet man on the guitar, a familiar fixture in the town’s daily life. One rain-lashed evening, they sought refuge in a cramped, noisy pub called The Trawler’s Arms, a place where the air was thick with the scent of wet wool and stale beer. They were nursing a pint each, paid for with the day’s earnings, when the landlord, a hulking man with a face like a friendly bulldog, approached them. He’d seen them play in the market square. He offered them a deal: play in the corner for two hours every Friday night, and he’d give them a hot meal and a running tab at the bar. To Murdo, it was a standard business transaction. To Alistair, it felt like being offered a peerage. It was an offer of belonging, of a regular place in the world. It was a promotion from the cold, indifferent street to the warm, chaotic heart of a community. Standing in the corner of the crowded pub a few nights later, the cheerful noise of the patrons a wall of sound around them, Alistair felt a flicker of something he had not experienced in years: a simple, uncomplicated happiness.

This fragile peace was a luxury the other players in the game could not afford. In the silent, pressurised environment of the royal household, Finn was living on a knife’s edge. He performed his duties with a flawless, robotic precision, but every moment was overshadowed by the constant, unnerving presence of the watchers. They were subtle, a new face on the security rota, a gardener lingering a little too long near the staff entrance, a quiet man in a nondescript car parked at the end of the public lane. He knew he was being observed, his every move scrutinised, his digital life undoubtedly laid bare on some screen in a dark room. Harrington had made him a baited hook, and the tension was becoming unbearable. The King had been gone for weeks. He would be out of money, exposed, vulnerable. The guilt was a physical weight, a constant, dull ache in his chest. He had to act. He had to send a warning, a lifeline, but every conventional avenue was a trap. The problem consumed him, and the solution, when it came, was born of a desperate, lateral leap of logic. He could not lead them to the King, but he could lead a message through the one person Harrington was already watching: Ewan.

He manufactured a plausible errand, a task so mundane it would arouse no suspicion. He informed Lord Harrington’s office that a minor painting from the King’s private collection, a small, dark landscape by a forgotten Victorian artist, required transport to a specialist conservator in Edinburgh for a routine condition assessment. Ewan, as the palace’s resident, if unofficial, art expert, would need to sign the release forms. The logic was sound, the paperwork unimpeachable. The next day, with the small, grim painting wrapped in brown paper under his arm, Finn drove an official vehicle to Edinburgh, knowing with absolute certainty that he was being followed. He parked outside Ewan’s studio, a plain brick building in a mews that offered clear lines of sight for any surveillance team. He was walking into the lion’s den, but he was carrying a message, not a weapon.

Ewan met him at the door, his face a mask of bored, cynical amusement. “Come to repossess my art supplies, Finn? Or has Harrington sent you to check I’m not painting seditious graffiti on the palace walls?” he drawled. Finn stepped inside, and Ewan closed the door. The studio was a chaotic riot of colour and scent, but the air was thick with a new, sharp tension. “They’re listening,” Finn said, his voice low, gesturing vaguely at the walls. “I was followed.” He explained everything in a torrent of whispered, urgent words: the surveillance, Harrington’s strategy, the invisible net closing around a man who had no idea he was being hunted. Ewan listened, his cynical smirk slowly dissolving, replaced by a look of grim, focused intensity. He walked to the center of the room, turning his back on Finn, and stared at a vast, half-finished canvas. “So, the great escape artist has left a trail of breadcrumbs, and Harrington has brought out the bloodhounds,” he murmured, more to himself than to Finn. “We can’t call, we can’t write, we can’t go to him. Anything we do, they see.” He fell silent, his mind, so used to finding patterns in chaos, working furiously. He picked up a stick of charcoal and drew a single, savage black line across the canvas. Then he turned, a flicker of wild, audacious inspiration in his eyes. “The radio,” he said.

Back in their small, cramped room, life continued its humble rhythm. After their first successful Friday night gig at The Trawler’s Arms, Murdo had declared the occasion worthy of a small celebration. He had spent a portion of their earnings on a bottle of passable whisky and a small, secondhand portable radio. The radio became a new fixture in their evenings, a tinny, crackling voice filling the silence, usually tuned to a station that played a comforting stream of bland, popular music. But one night, Murdo, scrolling through the dial, found what he was looking for. “Ah, here we go,” he said with satisfaction. “Robbie McLean’s ‘Highland Hearth’. Best folk show in the country.” The sound of a lone acoustic guitar filled the room, followed by the host’s warm, lilting voice. They sat in their chairs, a comfortable silence between them, listening to the old songs and stories of their nation. Alistair, sipping his measure of whisky, felt a profound sense of peace. The world had shrunk to the size of this small room, to the sound of a fiddle tune on the radio and the quiet presence of the only friend he had.

The radio host came back on after a haunting ballad. “Well, that was a classic for you. Now, we’ve got a special dedication coming up. This one goes out to a listener named Ally. It’s from his brother, who says he hopes he’s keeping warm and not forgetting his chords.” Alistair froze, the whisky glass halfway to his lips. His heart gave a single, painful thud. Murdo, oblivious, grunted in amusement. “Ally, eh? Popular name.” The host continued, his voice full of warmth. “His brother also wanted me to pass on a wee message. He says, ‘Watch out for the men in the grey suits, and remember Hector the Hero’.” The words struck Alistair with the force of a physical blow. *Ally. Brother. Grey suits. Hector the Hero.* The song Murdo had taught him. The song about the man who went to war and never came back. A warning. It was a warning, broadcast through time and space, a coded message smuggled into his sanctuary. The blood drained from his face, and the fragile peace of the small room shattered into a million pieces. He looked across at Murdo, who was nodding along to the next tune, completely unaware that the walls of their small, safe world had just been breached, that the war Alistair had tried to escape had finally found his new address.
