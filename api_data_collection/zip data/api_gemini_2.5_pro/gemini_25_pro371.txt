The Derry drizzle had a special kind of malice. It wasn't rain, not really. It was a persistent, atomised dampness that seeped into the very marrow of your bones, a liquid gloom that clung to the grey stone of the city walls and made the River Foyle look like a ribbon of molten lead. Arthur Cate, a man whose frame was as spare and taut as his bicycle's, felt the drizzle on his face and tasted it on his lips: a flavour of ancient peat and modern exhaust. He was in his small, meticulously ordered garage, the single bare bulb casting a halo of yellow light around him. The rest of the world, for all he cared, could drown in the murk.

His hands, surprisingly large and calloused for a man of his slender build, moved with a lover's tenderness over the mechanics of his machine. He oiled the chain, a drop of amber liquid on each link, wiping the excess with a cloth that was already stiff with a thousand similar ministrations. The bicycle wasn't just a mode of transport; it was his partner, his confessor, his weapon. A gleaming skeletal creature of alloy and carbon fibre, it stood in stark contrast to the crumbling brick and peeling paint of the garage. It was a thing of purpose in a world of decay.

Eugenia would be out in this. The thought came, as it always did, unbidden and cold. She loved the gloaming, the liminal hours when the day bled into night, and the drizzle that softened sounds and blurred outlines. She was a creature of thethresholds. He pictured her, a towering silhouette against the sodium orange of a distant streetlight, her form immense, indistinct, a thing of damp wool and looming shadow. He imagined the smell of her—wet soil and something like hot, forgotten metal, and underneath it all, a predatory musk that was pure, famished want. Lust, the papers would never dare to print. They spoke of a 'local problem', of 'troubled youths' and 'unexplained disappearances'. They didn't speak of Eugenia, the giantess who stalked the back alleys and the lonely riverside paths. They didn't speak of her hunger.

And they certainly didn't speak of the toes.

Arthur paused, the oily rag in his hand. His own toes curled inside his worn cycling shoes. He could see it, in his mind’s eye, the jar. A large, thick-glassed thing, a pickling jar perhaps, filled with a pale, cloudy fluid. And inside, suspended like grotesque little sea-creatures, were the toes. Some still pale and pristine, others darkening, all severed with a brute, untidy force. Trophies. Keepsakes. A macabre snow globe of her conquests. He felt a wave of nausea, acidic and hot, rise in his throat. He had to stop her. It wasn't a choice, it was a compulsion, a chemical imperative that hummed in his blood, as relentless as the drizzle outside. No one else saw her. No one else *could* see her. They only saw the aftermath, the empty spaces where teenagers used to be, the whispers that died on the lips of frightened parents. But Arthur saw. He knew.

On a large corkboard that dominated one wall of the garage, a map of the city was crucified with dozens of coloured pins. Red for a reported sighting—his own, always his own. Blue for a disappearance. Yellow for a place he'd found a strange, oversized footprint or a scrap of unusually coarse fabric. The pins formed constellations of terror, clustering around the wooded paths of St. Columb's Park, the shadowed underpasses of the Craigavon Bridge, the labyrinthine streets of the Bogside. He would spend hours just looking at it, his mind tracing her imagined routes, trying to find the pattern, the logic in her lust. He was a cyclist. He understood routes. He understood a body in motion, the expenditure of energy, the most efficient path from A to B. He would apply his own logic to her chaos, convinced that if he could just understand *how* she moved, he could finally predict *where* she would be.

He’d lose time, sometimes. He’d be staring at the map, tracing a line with his finger, and the next thing he knew the pale morning light would be filtering through the grimy window, his tea gone cold beside him, a strange ache in his joints as if he'd run a marathon in his sleep. He put it down to focus. The intensity of the hunt. But there were black spots, patches of memory that were just... gone. A missing hour here, an entire evening there. He’d wake up with mud on his shoes and no memory of a walk. He’d find a receipt in his pocket from a shop he didn't remember visiting. It was unsettling. Frightening, even. But the fear was a small thing, a distant star compared to the burning sun of his obsession with Eugenia.

He swung his leg over the bicycle, the frame cold against his thigh. The click of his cleats locking into the pedals was a satisfying, final sound. A commitment. He pushed the garage door upwards, its screech a cry of protest against the damp. The Derry air hit him, thick and heavy. He switched on his lights, a piercing white beam cutting the gloom ahead, a blinking red eye guarding his rear. He was a small, determined point of light in the overwhelming dark.

He began to pedal, his legs moving in a rhythm so practiced it was second nature. The bike responded instantly, a silent, swift extension of his will. He didn't ride for pleasure, not anymore. He rode to patrol. The city unfolded before him, a familiar territory made alien by his purpose. He saw not a pub, but a potential hunting ground. He saw not a group of laughing teenagers huddled in a bus shelter, but a target. A potential victim. A raw, protective fury surged in his chest. They were so fragile, so unaware. Their laughter and their music and their stupid, beautiful, vibrant lives were a candle flame in a hurricane. And Eugenia was the hurricane.

The tyres hissed on the wet tarmac. He rode along the river, the Foyle a vast, black mouth to his right. The Peace Bridge was lit up, its elegant curve a defiance against the oppressive sky. But Arthur saw only a vantage point. He imagined her standing at its highest point, a colossus surveying her domain, her gaze sweeping over the city, choosing. He pedaled harder, the muscles in his calves and thighs bunching and releasing. He was hunting a giant on a machine made of sticks and air. The absurdity was not lost on him, but it didn't matter.

He turned off the main road, into the warren of smaller streets that led towards the old city walls. The air grew colder here, the stone radiating a deep, historic chill. He passed a ginnel, a narrow passageway between two old buildings, and his head snapped to the side. A flicker of movement. A shadow that seemed to detach itself from the other shadows, a shape that was too tall, too broad. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat. He slowed, his hands squeezing the brake levers, a fine tremor running through his arms. Was it her? He peered into the inky blackness, his breath held tight in his chest. Nothing. A bin bag, probably, caught in a gust of wind. A trick of the light.

He told himself it was a trick of thelight.

But as he pedalled away, the feeling of being watched prickled the back of his neck. The feeling was so intense, so specific, it was almost a physical touch. He felt a strange, burgeoning ache in his own oversized shoes, a phantom pain in his knuckles. His hands, suddenly, felt huge on the grips, clumsy and powerful. He shook his head, a violent, quick motion, as if to dislodge a fly. Just the damp. Just the pressure of the chase. It was making him fanciful. It had to be. Wrong. The word was a single, hard pebble in the stream of his thoughts. It was real. She was real. And she was close. He pushed the thought away, pushed it down into a dark place, and focused on the rhythm of his pedaling, the burn in his lungs, a physical reality to anchor him in a world that was beginning to feel terrifyingly thin.The feeling persisted, a cold weight between his shoulder blades that had nothing to do with the drizzle. It was the specific, directed pressure of a hunter's gaze. He resisted the urge to look back, knowing he would see nothing but slick, empty streets. To turn would be to acknowledge the fear, to give it power. Instead, he focused on the path ahead, on the familiar geometry of the city. He pedalled through the Bogside, the towering gable-end murals like solemn frescoes in an open-air cathedral of memory and defiance. Figures of protest and tragedy watched him pass, their painted eyes seemingly following his small, fleeting light. Tonight, they looked less like memorials and more like warnings. He usually found a strange comfort here, a sense of solidarity with the city's stubborn refusal to forget. But now, the faces seemed to accuse him, to know the dark secret he carried. He felt the weight of their gaze and the phantom ache in his knuckles intensified, a deep, grinding pain as if he’d punched a stone wall. He flexed his fingers on the handlebars, the calloused skin feeling thick and alien, the grip of his hands on the rubber seeming to possess a crushing strength that was not his own.

The drizzle thickened, coalescing into a more definite rain that pattered on his helmet and slicked his jacket. He turned towards the Fahan Street roundabout, a place marked on his map with a cluster of pins – two blue, one yellow. It was here that young Declan Feeney had last been seen, walking home from a friend's house six weeks ago. It was here that Arthur, a week later, had found a single, enormous footprint pressed deep into the muddy verge near the underpass, a print so large he had at first mistaken it for a prank. The nausea returned, sharper this time. He could almost smell her again, that cloying mix of wet earth and hot metal, a scent that promised both violence and a strange, desolate intimacy. He imagined her looming in the shadows of the underpass, a patient predator waiting for the laughter of an approaching boy to curdle into a scream that would be swallowed by the night and the ceaseless traffic overhead.

A raw, protective fury surged through him, burning away the nausea. He was the city’s secret shepherd, his flock the oblivious youth who walked these streets. He was their only guardian against the monster in the gloaming. He stood on his pedals, driving the bike forward with renewed force, circling the roundabout as if his spinning wheels could somehow wind back time, could place him here six weeks ago to intercept Declan Feeney, to shout a warning, to throw his own frail body between the boy and the shadow. The thought was absurd, a fantasy of heroism that crumbled under the weight of its own impossibility. What could he, a man of wire and bone, do against a giantess? What was his weapon? A bicycle pump? A tyre lever? The absurdity sharpened into a spike of pure, cold fear.

Then he saw it. Tucked into the grimy corner of a low wall bordering a patch of wasteland, something small and white caught the beam of his headlamp. It wasn't a piece of litter. It had a specific shape. He braked hard, the rear wheel skidding slightly on the slick pavement. He unclipped and let the bike fall against the wall with a clatter of metal he barely registered. His heart was a frantic, trapped bird in his chest. He took a hesitant step, then another, his cycling shoes crunching on unseen gravel. The object was a trainer. A single, white, mud-splattered trainer, its laces undone, lying on its side like a dead thing. It looked like the kind of shoe every teenager in the city wore. It could be nothing. A lost shoe was just a lost shoe. But it lay near the centre of one of his pin-clusters. It was a sign. A breadcrumb.

He crouched down, his knees protesting. A strange energy thrummed through him, a predatory excitement that felt disturbingly familiar. His breath came in short, sharp bursts. He reached out a hand, his fingers trembling, not with fear, but with something else, something closer to anticipation. As his fingers brushed against the cold, damp canvas of the shoe, a jolt went through him, electric and profound. A memory, not his own, bloomed behind his eyes. The panicked flight, the desperate scramble over a wall, the shoe being sucked off by thick mud. He felt a colossal, triumphant frustration, the annoyance of prey that had almost, *almost*, gotten away clean. He felt the echo of a vast, rumbling laugh in a chest that was not his. The vision vanished as quickly as it came, leaving him kneeling in the rain, his hand recoiling from the shoe as if it were white-hot. The world tilted, the sodium lights of the street smearing into long, weeping streaks of orange. He felt huge, disoriented, his own small frame a cage for something impossibly large that was rattling the bars. The ache in his joints became a burning fire, and a deep, guttural sound escaped his lips, a noise of pure, famished want. It was a sound he did not recognise, but in the deepest marrow of his bones, he knew it was his own.He scrambled backwards, crab-walking away from the shoe, his cleats scraping uselessly on the wet tarmac. The sound he had made, that low, hungry growl, was still vibrating in his throat, a foreign and horrifying resonance. His mind, the precise, logical engine of a cyclist, a map-maker, was seizing, throwing up error messages he couldn't decipher. It wasn't real. It was a hallucination, a fugue state brought on by exhaustion and the single-mindedness of his quest. The pressure of the hunt had finally cracked him, that was all. He was a man obsessed, and obsession had its own fevers, its own phantoms. He clung to this explanation like a drowning man to a splinter of wood, even as the cold tide of a more terrible truth washed over him. He looked down at his own hands, splayed on the gritty pavement. They looked immense, the knuckles white and swollen, the callouses like plates of armour. They were the hands of a brute, not a mechanic.

He lurched to his feet, abandoning the trainer in the darkness. He snatched his bike from the wall, the frame feeling fragile and absurdly small in his grasp. The ride home was a blur of panicked flight. He was no longer a hunter on patrol; he was prey, fleeing a predator that was already inside the walls. The city he had just been scouring for threats now felt like a landscape of personal shame. Every shadowed ginnel, every darkened park entrance was not a potential lair for Eugenia, but a possible stage for his own forgotten violence. The groups of teenagers he saw taking shelter from the rain were no longer a flock to be protected, but a temptation he had to pedal furiously to escape. The raw, protective fury he had felt was gone, replaced by a cold, curdling self-loathing. The hiss of his tyres on the wet road was a serpent’s whisper, listing his sins.

Back in the garage, he slammed the corrugated door down, the final, shuddering bang sealing him in. The sound was one of finality, of a tomb being closed. He stood in the halo of the single bulb, his breath ragged, his body trembling with a violent, uncontrollable chill that had nothing to do with the cold. The familiar smell of oil and rubber was tainted by something else, the phantom scent of wet soil and hot metal he had for so long associated with her. He ripped his helmet off, his hair plastered to his skull with sweat and rain, and flung it into a corner. It hit a stack of old newspapers with a dull thud. The sound was an accusation. He felt trapped, not in his garage, but in his own skin, in his own skull. His meticulously ordered world, his one defence against the chaos, had been a lie.

His gaze was drawn to the corkboard on the wall, as if by a physical force. The map of Derry, crucified with its coloured pins. It was no longer a diagram of his hunt; it was a confession. The red pins weren't sightings of Eugenia; they were markers for his own prowling, the moments the hunger began to stir. The blue pins weren't just disappearances; they were his successes, the black holes in the city that corresponded to the black holes in his own memory. And the yellow pins—the footprint, the scrap of fabric, the shoe out there in the dark—they were the clues he had left for himself. The crumbs he, Arthur Cate the meticulous cyclist, had scattered for Arthur Cate the obsessive hunter to find, a desperate, subconscious attempt to catch himself. His focus, his lost time, the marathons he ran in his sleep—it was all her. It was all him. The two threads, the hunter and the hunted, twisted together until they were one and the same. Arthur Cate did not hunt the giantess. He became her.The map was a liar. Or rather, it was the one truly honest thing in the garage, and he was the lie. Arthur stood before it, his body rigid, the trembling having subsided into a deep, internal vibration, like a tuning fork struck against bone. Each pin was a nail in his own coffin. Red for the rising of the beast, the times he’d felt the familiar, thrilling ache in his bones and mounted his bicycle under the pretence of a patrol. Blue for the silence that followed, the empty mornings when he would wake up exhausted, with mud-caked shoes and a black hole where a night should be. The pins were not a pattern of her movements, but a diary of his own fragmentation. He was a cartographer of his own monstrosity. The meticulous order, the loving care for his machine, the disciplined life—it was all a cage, and every evening, he had willingly picked the lock and let the monster out to feed.

A cold, deliberate calm descended over him, the kind that follows an explosion. The question was no longer *if*, but *how*. The details, his mind craved the details, the proof that would annihilate the last, desperate flicker of denial. The jar. The thought was a physical blow, and he staggered back from the map, his hand flying to his mouth. He had imagined it so clearly, the thick glass, the pale fluid, the grotesque contents. Was it a vision, a morbid fantasy born of his obsession, or was it a memory, bubbling up from the submerged part of his consciousness? He had to know. He scanned the garage, his sanctuary, now a suspect territory. Where would she hide her treasures? Where would *he* hide them? It would be somewhere dark. Somewhere forgotten. Somewhere Arthur Cate, the man of order, would never look. His eyes fell on a pile of old tarpaulins and rotting potato sacks in the far corner, a messy blight he had always meant to clear out but had never quite gotten around to. A pocket of chaos in his world of control. Of course.

He moved towards the pile, his steps stiff and robotic. His body felt like a poorly piloted machine, the connection between mind and limbs tenuous and strange. He pulled away the stiff, dusty canvas of the top tarpaulin, a smell of mildew and damp earth rising to meet him. Beneath it was a stack of old, water-damaged encyclopaedias and, behind them, a heavy wooden crate stencilled with the name of a long-defunct brand of Irish whiskey. It was sealed. He didn’t have a crowbar. For a moment, he was paralyzed by the simple, practical problem, his mind clinging to it. But then he looked at his hands, those large, calloused, powerful hands. A memory, unbidden, of splintering a wooden pallet for a bonfire with his bare fists, a sensation of savage, exhilarating strength. He knelt, wedged his fingers under the lid of the crate, and pulled. The wood groaned, fibres tearing, and with a sharp crack, the lid splintered upwards, a long nail screeching as it was ripped from its housing.

There was no need to rummage inside. It was nestled in a bed of yellowed straw, just as he had known it would be. A large, commercial-grade pickling jar, its metal lid screwed on tight. The fluid inside was cloudy, a pale, sickly yellow, like stagnant water. And suspended within it, turning slowly in the disturbed liquid, were the toes. He could see at least a dozen, some small and pearlescent, others larger, the skin beginning to grey and wrinkle. They were severed crudely, with slivers of bone and torn flesh still visible on some. They danced in their chemical bath like a puppeteer’s cruel joke. He saw it all, not as a witness, but as a participant. He felt the snap of bone, the wet, tearing resistance of sinew, the cold shock of the keepsake in his massive, warm hand. The nausea he had felt before was a pale imitation of the bile that now surged into the back of his throat, hot and acidic. He clamped a hand over his mouth, a choked sob breaking from his chest as he fell back onto the concrete floor, his carefully constructed world not just cracked, but utterly atomised.

The man on the floor, Arthur Cate, wept. He wept for the lost teenagers, for their parents, for a city haunted by a monster it couldn't see. He wept for the boy he once was, a skinny lad who loved the clean mechanics of a bicycle and the logic of a well-plotted route. But as he wept, another part of him, a deeper, colder consciousness, watched with a dispassionate curiosity. Eugenia felt the man’s grief as a distant, irritating tremor. She felt the satisfaction of the full jar, a larder stocked against lean times. She felt the insult of the splinter in her/his hand from the broken crate. The two consciousnesses swirled, a sickening vortex of horror and pride, of grief and hunger. He was a ghost in his own body, a prisoner watching a tyrant admire its own bloody work. The tears stopped. The weeping shuddered to a halt. He was empty. The city had a local problem, and the problem was him.

He pushed himself to his feet, his joints grinding. The cyclist’s mind, the strategist, reasserted itself, not with the thrill of the hunt but with the grim determination of a bomb disposal expert. He had to contain the blast. He looked at the bicycle, his gleaming partner. It was no longer a weapon; it was the getaway vehicle. It was the key. He walked over to it, his movements slow and deliberate, and with a wrench from his tool board, he began to methodically dismantle it. The pedals came off first, then the wheels, the satisfying slick-click of the quick-release levers now sounding like the opening of a cell door. He deflated the tyres, the hiss of escaping air like a final, dying breath. He took the chain off its sprockets, the oily links coiling into his hand like a dead snake. He would ground himself. He would cage the beast by taking away its legs. He would apply his own logic to her chaos, not to predict her, but to prevent her. It was a new map he was drawing, a map of confinement, with his own garage as the epicentre.

But even as he worked, his hands moving with their old, practiced efficiency, a new sensation began to creep in. The rhythmic patter of the rain on the roof, once a sound he could lose himself in, was now a drumbeat, a call to arms. The air in the garage, thick with the smell of oil and his own cold sweat, began to feel thin, stale. A deep, cavernous ache opened up inside him, a physical craving for the wet, open dark. He could feel the gloaming outside, the blurring of edges, the softening of sounds. He could feel the city breathing, its lonely paths and shadowed alleyways waiting. The muscles in his back and shoulders tightened, a phantom memory of immense size and power. His hands, holding a delicate Allen key, felt clumsy, constrained. The hunger, the chemical imperative he had named and tried to hunt, was not a separate entity. It was a fundamental part of his own chemistry, and it was beginning to bubble, to rise, to demand. He could dismantle the bike, he could lock the door, but he was already in the cage with the monster. And the monster was getting restless.The meticulous disassembly was a kind of prayer in reverse, an unmaking of his own soul. Each turn of the wrench was an act of penance, each loosened bolt a small severing. His hands, which had always known this machine with a blind, intimate grace, were now clumsy and brutish. The delicate threads of a derailleur screw felt coarse and unyielding under his thick-skinned fingers, the Allen key a fragile twig threatening to snap in his grasp. He laid each component on the concrete floor with a reverence that was now laced with dread, arranging the parts in neat rows as if preparing a body for burial. The chain lay in a greasy, lifeless heap. The wheels, stripped of their purpose, leaned against the wall like useless shields. The frame, a marvel of lightweight engineering, was now just an inert, skeletal sculpture. It was all for nothing. The ache in his bones wasn't fading; it was deepening, settling into his joints like silt. The garage, once his fortress, was shrinking, the air growing thin and tight, and the steady drumming of the rain on the roof was no longer a comforting rhythm but a maddening, incessant summons.

His work done, he stood over the corpse of his bicycle, a profound emptiness echoing inside him. The act had brought no peace, only a confirmation of his own impotence. Grounding the machine had not grounded the man, because the man was no longer the one in charge of the engine. His gaze, pulled by an invisible string, drifted back to the broken crate, to the obscene secret it held. The jar. It pulsed in the periphery of his vision, a beacon of his own depravity. A part of him, the dwindling Arthur, screamed to smash it, to obliterate the evidence and the memories it held. But a stronger, colder impulse, the possessive instinct of the collector, recoiled at the thought. They were trophies. Proof. A record of her glorious, terrible work. The thought was not his, yet it bloomed in his mind with the simple, unassailable logic of a predator admiring its kill. He had to get it out. Out of the garage, out of his life. He had to un-know it.

With leaden steps, he crossed the floor and knelt again before the crate. He reached in, his hands shaking, and lifted the heavy glass jar. The fluid sloshed, and the pale contents tumbled over one another in a slow, grotesque ballet. His eyes locked onto one in particular. It was smaller than the others, almost delicate, the nail painted with a chipped, glittery blue polish. A memory, sharp and blinding as a flashbulb, erupted behind his eyes. A girl, no older than sixteen, her face pale in the moonlight of a riverside park. The sound of her laughter, high and clear, turning into a gasp. Not of fear, at first, but of surprise, as a vast hand clamped over her mouth. He/she felt the exhilarating thrill of the chase, the brief, furious struggle, the immense, satisfying power that coursed through limbs that were not Arthur's slender ones. He/she felt the cold, curious detachment of the collector, selecting the perfect memento. The snap. The warmth. The secret, tucked away.

He cried out, a thin, strangled sound, and nearly dropped the jar. The memory receded, leaving him kneeling on the cold concrete, drenched in a sweat that was colder than the Derry drizzle. The Foyle. The river would take it. He would walk to the centre of the Peace Bridge and cast this horror into the black, churning water, letting the current carry his sins away to the cold oblivion of the sea. The thought was a lifeline, a new, clear objective. It was a route, a destination. The cartographer in his soul seized upon it, a final, desperate plan. He would perform this one last task as Arthur Cate, a pilgrimage of atonement. Then, he didn't know. He couldn't let himself think beyond the bridge, beyond the release. He clutched the jar to his chest like a cursed relic, the cold glass burning through the thin fabric of his shirt.

But to get to the river, he had to go outside. He had to open the door. The moment the thought formed, the beast inside him stirred, stretched, and awoke. A jolt of pure, electric anticipation shot through him. The outside. The gloaming. The wet streets that smelled of peat and exhaust and fear. The ache in his bones transformed into a thrumming, resonant power. The tight air in the garage became a suffocating vacuum he suddenly, violently, needed to escape. His lungs burned, not with panic, but with a deep, primal craving for the thick, damp night air. The walls, which had been shrinking, now felt like a physical restraint, a cage he had to break. He could feel the city waiting for him, a smorgasbord of flickering lives, of warm bodies moving through the dark. The sound of a car horn in the distance was a starting pistol. The hunt was on.

He stood, the jar held tight in the crook of one arm. The man, Arthur, was focused on the river, on the act of cleansing. The monster, Eugenia, was focused on the open territory beyond the door. His walk towards the garage door was a strange, lurching gait, the stride too long for his legs, his shoulders rolling with a power his slim frame should not possess. He reached the door, but his hand didn't go to the latch. The methodical, logical Arthur Cate would have simply unlocked it and rolled it upwards. But Arthur Cate was a passenger now. He looked at his free hand, flexing the fingers, feeling the phantom sensation of immense strength, of splintering wood. A low growl rumbled in his chest, a sound of profound impatience. He placed his palms flat against the cold, corrugated metal. The man wanted to purge his sin. The monster wanted to get to work. With a surge of strength that buckled the thin steel, he began to push outwards, not upwards. Metal screamed, screws tore from the wooden frame, and the entire door bowed under a force that was utterly, terrifyingly inhuman. He was going to the river, yes. But the hunter was leading the way.### Chapter 2

The garage door did not just bend; it surrendered. With a final, agonised shriek of tearing metal and splintering wood, the locking mechanism gave way and the whole structure burst outwards into the narrow alley, grotesquely warped and hanging from a single, twisted hinge. Arthur—or the thing wearing Arthur’s body—stepped through the jagged opening into the night. The drizzle was no longer a malicious chill but a welcome, intimate caress, a balm on skin that felt too tight, too hot. He took a breath, a deep, shuddering inhalation that was not a gasp of exertion but a connoisseur’s appraisal of the air. It was rich, layered. He could taste the wet rot of fallen leaves in the gutter, the sour tang of beer from the pub on the corner, and underneath it all, a faint, tantalising thread of human warmth and anxiety, the living scent of the city. He was a creature uncaged, and his territory smelled delicious.

The jar was a cold, heavy anchor against his ribs. It was the only part of the plan that remained, the last will and testament of the man who had loved his bicycle. *Get to the bridge. Cast it away. End this.* The thought was a weak, flickering signal from a distant transmitter, nearly drowned out by the roar of static that was Eugenia’s burgeoning awareness. His stride was wrong. It was too long, a rolling, predatory gait that belonged to a much larger creature. His worn cycling jacket, usually a loose fit, was now strained across his shoulders, the seams groaning in protest. He could feel the power coiled in his thighs and back, a profound, alien strength that made the simple act of walking feel like a study in barely-leashed violence. The streets of his city, once a familiar map for patrol, were now a banquet laid out before him. Every lighted window was a plate, every distant siren a dinner bell.

He turned onto the street that led towards the Bogside, his feet, encased in the flimsy, cleated shoes, making a strange, slapping sound on the pavement. The pain in his oversized shoes was gone, replaced by a feeling of grounded, formidable weight. He passed the great murals, their silent, painted figures no longer seeming to accuse him but to watch with a kind of solemn understanding, witnesses to a power far older than the political struggles they depicted. Here, he felt not shame, but a strange sense of homecoming. He remembered the shadows in the corner of Free Derry Corner, the way they pooled deep and black enough to hide a giantess. He remembered the taste of fear in the air near the old gasworks, a vintage he had savoured more than once. The memories were not his, but they belonged to him, a dark and bloody inheritance he was only now beginning to comprehend.

A man stumbled out of a bookmaker’s, fumbling with a dripping umbrella, the smell of stale tobacco and disappointment clinging to him like a shroud. He was of middle age, soft around the middle, his face illuminated for a second by a passing car’s headlights. Arthur’s head snapped towards him, an involuntary, wolf-like motion. Eugenia’s senses flared. She could hear the man’s wheezing breath, the frantic, irregular thump of his heart, strained by cheap food and years of small anxieties. She could see the pulse beating in the fleshy part of his neck, a delicate, fluttering thing. So easy. A brief, satisfying surge of power, a muffled cry swallowed by the rain, and another empty space left in the city. The hunger was a physical thing, a hollow, burning void in his/her stomach that demanded to be filled. Arthur’s mind screamed. He tightened his grip on the jar, the cold glass a point of focus, a rosary of horror. *The bridge. The Foyle takes all. The bridge.* He forced his legs to keep moving, to tear his gaze away from the man, who shuffled off into the gloom, utterly oblivious to the fact that he had just walked through the shadow of his own death. The effort left Arthur trembling, sweat beading on his brow, the internal struggle a far greater exertion than any hill climb he had ever endured.### Chapter 3

The man from the bookmaker’s was gone, his shuffling footsteps swallowed by the wet, indifferent night. Arthur stood trembling in the alley’s mouth, the near-miss leaving him nauseated and hollowed out. He had won, but it was the victory of a man who holds a castle wall for one more minute while the enemy is already inside the keep, setting fires. The resistance had cost him dearly. It had shown the hunger that it could be denied, and the hunger had not liked it. It was now a coiled, furious thing inside him, a beast poked with a stick, its frustration a palpable force that made his teeth ache and his stomach cramp with a sour, predatory rage. Eugenia was learning the limits of his frail, human will, and finding them wanting.

He forced himself onward, his route to the river a gauntlet of memory and temptation. He passed a brightly lit chippy, steam fogging its windows, the smell of hot vinegar and frying batter thick in the air. Arthur remembered stopping here on long summer rides, his legs pleasantly tired, buying a bottle of water and feeling a quiet contentment. Eugenia remembered lurking in the unlit ginnel opposite, watching the patrons come and go, assessing their gaits, their aloneness, the vulnerability in their laughter. He walked past a row of terraced houses, their front rooms glowing with the blue flicker of televisions. For Arthur, they were images of warmth and mundane peace. For Eugenia, they were larders, their thin glass and cheap locks a trivial inconvenience. The whole city had become a palimpsest, Arthur’s familiar map written over with Eugenia’s bloody cartography of opportunity and appetite.

The jar was a dead, cold weight in his arms, its ghastly contents a constant, sloshing reminder of his purpose. As he passed a darkened solicitor’s office, he caught his image in the wide, rain-streaked plate glass window. He saw a man, gaunt and haunted, his rain-plastered hair clinging to his skull, his frame pathetically slight. He was clutching a huge pickling jar as if it were a child he was rescuing from a fire. But for a trick of the light, the reflection seemed to ripple, to distend. The shadow he cast from the streetlamp behind him was a betrayal, a monstrous silhouette that refused to match the meagre shape of his body. It loomed, impossibly broad and tall, its head scraping the top of the window frame. For a horrifying, lucid moment, he saw them both, man and monster, superimposed and inseparable, a single, two-natured thing staring back from the abyss of the glass. He flinched away, a sob catching in his throat, and hurried on, his gaze fixed on the ground.

He could hear the river now, a low, constant rush, and with it came another sound. It was a sound that snagged every fibre of Eugenia’s being, a sound that was both a promise and a command: laughter. Young, loud, and careless, it echoed from under the concrete span of a riverside walkway just ahead. He slowed, his body acting before his mind could protest. Peering around the corner of a stone buttress, he saw them. Five of them, a mix of boys and girls, no older than seventeen. They were sharing a vape, the sweet-smelling cloud illuminated in the shifting glow of their phones, their faces a collage of youthful bravado and fleeting beauty. They were so breakable. They were perfect. The hunger, which had been a furious coil, now erupted, a volcano of pure, physical need that swamped every other sensation. This was her hunting ground. This was her prey.

This was the precipice. The full, annihilating force of the craving descended, and Arthur’s consciousness was reduced to a single, panicked scream in the back of a vast, dark cathedral. He fought. He dug the fingernails of his free hand into the flesh of his thigh, pushing through the fabric of his trousers, hoping the sharp, grounding pain could cut through the red haze. He stared at the jar in his arms, focusing on the contents, trying to force the revulsion to overcome the desire. *This is you. This is what you do.* The Peace Bridge was visible now, just a few hundred yards away, its graceful white arches a beacon of sanctuary. *The bridge. Just get to the bridge.* But Eugenia’s instincts were a tidal wave, pulling him towards the walkway. His feet began to move, not towards the bridge, but towards the laughter. He took one step, then two, the predatory slouch returning to his shoulders. He was a wolf stalking a fire-lit camp. He wrenched his body to a halt, the conflict so violent that a strangled, animal sound tore from his throat, half-growl, half-sob. Under the walkway, the laughter stopped. A head looked up. “Did you hear that?” one of them asked, their voice suddenly small in the immense dark. They all fell silent, peering out into the rain, their brief moment of security shattered. Their fear drifted towards him on the damp air, and it smelled like perfume. It was an invitation. It was almost too much to bear.The scent of their sudden silence and sharp, attentive fear was a drug. Eugenia’s senses, already heightened, flooded with a rush of euphoric power. It was the moment the prey knows it is being watched, the exquisite tipping point between blissful ignorance and a terror that was its own kind of ecstasy. The hunger roared, no longer a hollow ache but a solid, physical presence demanding release. His/her muscles bunched, coiling for a forward spring, a silent, swift closing of the distance. Arthur, the tiny, screaming man in the back of his own mind, threw every ounce of his remaining will against the tide. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to block out the sight of them, huddled and fragile, but the image was seared onto the inside of his eyelids. He focused on the glass jar, its cold reality a counter-weight to the hot rush of instinct. He could feel the crude edges of the severed toes through the glass, a litany of his sins pressed against his ribs. It was not enough. His body took another lurching step forward, his hand beginning to rise, not to wave, not to gesture, but to grip.

"Is someone there?" a boy’s voice called out, trying for defiant but landing on brittle. The direct question, the acknowledgement of his presence, was a spear of ice through the red haze. It made him a person, not just a shadow. It made them people, not just a meal. Another memory flared, unbidden and sharp. A different voice, a girl's voice, years ago, on a lonely path in St. Columb's Park. "Arthur? Is that you?" She had known him. He had been a familiar shape in the dark, right up until the moment he wasn't. The memory of her trusting face, the last thing he saw before the monster took her, was an agony that dwarfed the hunger. He looked down at the jar, at the macabre swirl of his trophies, and a wave of absolute self-revulsion, cold and final, crested over him. These weren't trophies. They were tombstones. They were all that was left of people who had names, who had called out into the dark, looking for a friend.

The revulsion gave him the strength. With a raw, guttural cry that was pure human anguish, he tore himself away. It felt like ripping his own flesh. His body convulsed, fighting the command to turn, to retreat. He stumbled backward, his cleated shoes slipping on the wet ground, his own muscles warring against each other. To the teenagers under the walkway, the brief, terrifying vision was of a figure in the darkness who seemed to spasm violently before turning and fleeing, a hunched, misshapen thing moving with a painful, crab-like gait into the night. They didn't see a giantess. they saw something broken, something deeply, profoundly wrong, a glimpse of madness that was more unsettling than any straightforward threat. They stayed silent long after he was gone, the cold of the night seeping into them in a way it hadn't before. They would not linger here again.

Arthur ran. It was not the smooth, efficient motion of a cyclist, but a desperate, panicked scramble. He fled from the riverbank, from the tempting sounds of life, and most of all, from himself. The Peace Bridge loomed ahead, its elegant, lit curve no longer a symbol of hope but a desperate finish line. Eugenia raged inside him, a thwarted predator screaming betrayal. She sent phantom pains shooting through his legs, tried to lock his joints, to make him fall. The hunger was a physical presence at his back, a vast, cold shadow whose breath he could feel on his neck. He clutched the heavy jar to his chest, its weight the only thing keeping him anchored to his purpose. Every jarring step made the contents slosh, a sickening internal rhythm that matched the panicked beat of his own heart. He was no longer a man going to the river. He was a sickness, running towards a cure he knew would kill him.He reached the foot of the Peace Bridge and faltered, the sudden open space a shock after the tight, confining streets. The bridge was a stark white skeleton arched against the black sky, its lights casting a sterile, clinical glow that offered no shadows to hide in. It felt like stepping onto a stage under a bank of unforgiving spotlights. For Eugenia, it was alien territory, a place of exposure and vulnerability. For Arthur, it was the altar he had been seeking. He took a staggering step onto the pedestrian walkway, his cleated shoes making a hollow, pathetic clicking sound on the boards, a sound utterly out of place with the deep, mournful rush of the Foyle below. Each step was a battle, a conscious act of forcing one foot in front of the other against a current of pure, instinctual wrongness that screamed at him to turn back, to flee into the familiar, comforting labyrinth of the city’s dark alleys.

The journey to the centre of the span was the longest walk of his life. He kept his eyes down, fixed on the sloshing contents of the jar, unable to look at the city he had terrorised. But he could feel it on his left, a sprawling galaxy of warm lights, each one a life, a family, a story he had preyed upon. The constellations of terror from his corkboard map were laid out in reality, and the weight of that knowledge was a physical pressure on his chest, making each breath a ragged, painful effort. The rage from Eugenia had subsided, replaced by a cold, watchful stillness. She was coiled within him, waiting. She understood, on some primal level, what he intended to do. It was not a fight anymore; it was a standoff on a precipice, and she was conserving her strength for the final, decisive moment. The only sounds were his own gasping breath, the drumming of the rain on his jacket, and the vast, black whisper of the river.

He stopped at the highest point of the arch, where the view was widest and the drop was longest. The wind was stronger here, a physical force that tore at his clothes and tried to push him back. It whistled through the cables of the bridge, a high, keening sound like a lament. He leaned against the railing, the metal cold and slick beneath his trembling hands, and dared to look down. The River Foyle was a vast, black mouth, its surface churned by the rain and the current, reflecting the city lights as distorted, bleeding smears of colour. It looked hungry. It looked final. This was the place. He gripped the jar, his knuckles white, and with a surge of desperate, final strength, he hoisted it up, its weight almost pulling him off balance. He held it over the railing, poised above the abyss.

This was the moment. The act itself. And with it, Eugenia struck. It was not a physical assault, not a locking of his joints or a spasm of pain. It was a flood. A tidal wave of pure sensation washed through him, a lifetime of her memories and her pleasures condensed into a single, overwhelming instant. He felt the thrill of the chase, the intoxicating power of a body that could outrun and out-muscle any prey. He felt the profound satisfaction of a successful hunt, the quieting of the great hunger. He felt the cool, detached pride of the collector admiring her handiwork, the jar not a thing of horror but a work of art, a testament to her existence, her power. A voice, deep and resonant and female and his own, bloomed in the centre of his mind. *This is not our shame,* it purred, the logic simple, undeniable. *This is our strength. This is us. To throw this away is to throw away the only part of you that is truly alive. Are you so eager to go back to being a ghost on a bicycle, a thin man in a grey world? I am your colour. I am your purpose.* His arms began to shake, his resolve crumbling under the seductive weight of her truth. The man who wanted to die and the monster who wanted to live were locked in a final, terrible embrace, and the man was losing.### Chapter 4

The voice of Eugenia was not a violation; it was a homecoming. It was the rich, dark soil from which the spindly, etiolated plant of Arthur Cate had grown. He had spent his life convinced he was the plant, weak and bloodless, when all along he was the soil, vast and ancient and hungry. *I am your purpose.* The words dismantled the architecture of his guilt, beam by beam. His entire adult life, a meticulously constructed cage of routine and ritual—the bicycle, the map, the lonely cups of tea—had been built not to contain a monster, but to starve a god. His shame was a blasphemy against his own nature. The horror he felt was the terror of a small, frightened part of himself staring into the face of its own immense, undeniable truth. His arms, holding the jar over the black water, were not trembling with the effort of letting go, but with the unbearable strain of fighting the instinct to hold on. The jar wasn't an urn of ashes; it was a seed bank. It held the evidence of his power, the promise of his continuity.

Slowly, deliberately, the muscles in his arms unlocked. But they did not release their burden into the void. Instead, they contracted, drawing the heavy glass jar back from over the precipice, pulling it in from the cold, howling wind and cradling it against the meagre warmth of his chest. The action was one of profound and final surrender. There was no victory, no defeat, only a cessation of hostilities. The screaming man in the back of his mind, the frantic, terrified Arthur Cate, did not die. He simply fell silent, his long, exhausting protest finally over. He was subsumed, absorbed into the greater whole, his consciousness a single drop of rain rejoining the vast, dark ocean of Eugenia. The war was over because there had never been two sides, only one being pretending it was at war with itself. A deep, shuddering peace settled over him, the likes of which he had never known.

The change was immediate and total. The violent trembling that had wracked his body ceased, replaced by a formidable stillness. The persistent, grinding ache in his joints, the feeling of a large body being compressed into a small one, dissolved into a sensation of integrated, boundless strength. He straightened up from the railing, his spine lengthening, his shoulders broadening not in a spasm but in a natural assumption of their true posture. The wind that tore at him was no longer a hostile force but a familiar current, an element he moved through with ease. He took a breath, and for the first time, it did not feel like a desperate gasp for air in a shrinking room, but a full, satisfying draught that filled his entire being. He felt his hands, those clumsy, powerful things, curl around the jar with a new, possessive tenderness. He was no longer a prisoner in his own skin; he was, at last, simply himself.

He turned his head, his gaze sweeping across the river to the city lights. It was the same view, but the lens had changed. He saw the Bogside, the city walls, the distant glow of St. Columb’s Park. They were no longer a catalogue of his sins or a map of his shame. They were a pantry. He looked upon the clusters of light with the cool, appraising eye of a farmer surveying his livestock. The raw, protective fury he had once felt for the city’s youth felt like a phantom limb, a distant memory of an emotion that no longer made sense. Protection was a lie told by the weak. The strong did not protect; they fed. It was the simple, immutable logic of the world, and for the first time, he was on the right side of the equation. He felt no malice, no evil, only the calm, powerful certainty of his place in the natural order of things.

With the jar held securely in the crook of his arm, he began to walk. He did not retreat back towards his garage, back towards the pathetic, disassembled remnants of Arthur Cate’s life. He strode forward, across the second half of the bridge, towards the Waterside district. It was a new direction, a crossing over in more ways than one. His gait was no longer the lurching, conflicted shamble of a man at war with his own body. It was a long, rhythmic, powerful stride, a walk that consumed the ground with an effortless grace. He was a creature of immense size and purpose moving with the lethal quiet of a stalking cat. The only sound that betrayed the man he had been was the faint, absurd click-clack of his cycling cleats on the walkway, a final, fading echo of a life that was now utterly irrelevant. He was walking away from everything he had known, not as a fugitive, but as an emperor entering a new province of his domain.

Reaching the end of the bridge, he stepped from the hollow boards onto the solid, wet pavement of the street. He did not look back at the white arches that had served as the stage for his transformation. His focus was entirely forward, on the warren of sleeping streets that lay before him. He slipped into the first deep shadow he found, not with the skittish motion of a man hiding, but with the fluid ease of a creature returning to its element. The shadow embraced him, a perfect fit. The Derry drizzle continued to fall, a steady, cleansing baptism on the city stone. Arthur Cate, the ghost on the bicycle, was gone, his final purpose served. In the gloom, a new and ancient being stood, whole and calm and patient, holding its future in its arms, and began to consider where it would hunt next.The quiet, manicured streets of the Waterside received him not as a stranger, but as a long-awaited sovereign. This side of the river lacked the dense, historic wounds of the Bogside; it was a landscape of sleeping lawns, orderly rows of semi-detached houses, and the profound silence of suburban contentment. Through Eugenia’s senses, this silence was not empty but resonant, humming with the contained, sleeping life within the brick walls. The prey was corralled, docile, dreaming in their pens. It was a different kind of hunting ground, less wild but more bountiful. As he moved, a single, infuriating sound broke the perfect symphony of the night: the sharp, unnatural click-clack of his cycling cleats on the pavement. It was the sound of Arthur Cate. It was a sound of weakness, of a specialised and fragile purpose. It was the last, irritating ghost of the man he had been, and it had to be silenced.

The practicalities of his new existence asserted themselves with a cold, clear logic. Arthur’s methodical mind, now a subordinate but useful tool, assessed the situation. The jar, his sacred history, was a treasure to be secured, not an encumbrance to be carried into the fray. The tight cycling jacket, a second skin for a man of wire and bone, was a straitjacket on a body that now felt expansive and formidable. The shoes were a tactical liability, their noise an unforgivable betrayal of stealth. A new nest was required. The garage across the river was a museum of a dead man, a place of conflict and shame. He needed a place of power, a den on this new frontier. He needed to shed the last of Arthur’s skin before he could properly hunt in his own.

He veered away from the street-lit pavements, drawn by instinct towards the darker, unkempt spaces that festered between the neat estates. He followed a scent on the air, a rich perfume of decay and damp earth, the smell of forgotten things. Arthur’s memory, now an indexed archive for Eugenia’s use, supplied a vague recollection: an old allotment, fallen into disuse years ago after the council cut its funding. He found it behind a crumbling wall, a lost garden of tangled brambles, skeletal greenhouses, and the stooped, weary shapes of abandoned sheds. It was a place of ordered life that had succumbed to chaos, a perfect mirror for his own becoming. He chose the largest shed, its door hanging ajar, its roof a thick mat of moss and ivy. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of old soil, rusted iron, and the faint, sweet scent of long-dead flowers.

It was a sanctuary. He moved to the driest corner, clearing a high, sturdy shelf with a sweep of his hand. There, he placed the jar. It was not an act of hiding, but of enthronement. In the gloom, the glass seemed to gather the faint ambient light, the pale shapes within turning gently as if in acknowledgement. This was the new altar. This was the heart of his territory. Then, he addressed the final irritation. He looked down at the absurd shoes. He could have unlaced them, but that was Arthur’s way, a gesture of careful disassembly. Eugenia’s way was more direct. He lifted his right foot and brought it down with focused, crushing force onto a half-buried paving slab. The hard plastic cleat shattered with a sharp crack that was shockingly loud in the silence. He did the same with the left. The sound was a punctuation mark. A full stop at the end of a long and tedious chapter. He slipped the ruined shoes off, his bare feet pressing into the cool, damp earth of the shed floor. The connection was immediate, a circuit completed. He was grounded. He was home.

He emerged from the shed a different creature. The last vestiges of the cyclist had been purged. He was now just a shape in the dark, silent and barefoot, moving with a weightless, predatory purpose. He drifted through the sleeping gardens and back onto the deserted streets, a panther gliding through a zoo after closing time. The power inside him was no longer a raging fire but a deep, humming dynamo, utterly under his control. He was not frantic, not desperate. He was patient. He stopped at the corner of a long, straight road, a corridor of identical houses, and simply listened. He filtered out the drone of a distant lorry, the hum of refrigerators, the sigh of the wind. He was listening for a heartbeat, for a life that was out of place. And then he heard it. Not the boisterous laughter of a group, but the thin, tinny bleed of music from headphones. Ahead of him, a lone figure ambled down the centre of the road, hood pulled low, head bowed to the glow of a phone, oblivious. The figure was a small island of light and sound in the vast, quiet darkness, and Eugenia, a patient tide, began to move silently, inexorably, to meet it.The boy was a small beacon of distraction in the vast, quiet dark. The tinny rattle of drums and synthesizers leaking from his headphones created a perimeter of noise around him, a sonic forcefield that was, in reality, a blindfold and a pair of earplugs. He walked with the shuffling, head-down gait of someone navigating by the light of a phone screen, his entire universe compressed into the glowing rectangle in his hands. To Eugenia, he was a creature of profound and beautiful vulnerability. She slipped from the shadows of a weeping willow, her bare feet making no sound on the wet tarmac. The cold of the pavement was a sharp, pleasant reality, a direct interface with her territory. She flowed across the street, a ripple in the darkness, using the hulking shapes of parked cars as cover, her movements liquid and economical. There was no thrill of the chase, no adrenalized excitement. This was not sport. It was work, and she was an artisan.

She shadowed him for a hundred yards, studying his rhythm. The way his head bobbed slightly in time with the unheard music, the way he occasionally stumbled on an uneven paving stone without looking up, the sheer, unbroken solitude of his journey. Arthur would have seen a boy to be saved, a candle to be shielded. Eugenia saw a harvest that was perfectly ripe. The protective instinct was a phantom limb she could no longer feel, a ghost of a sensation belonging to a man who no longer existed. Her own instincts were far simpler and infinitely more honest. The boy was sustenance. His oblivious life force was a warmth she was drawn to, a meal she had located. There was no malice in it, no more than a river feels malice as it erodes its banks. It was simply her nature.

The street opened into a small, grassy square, an island of relative darkness between streetlamps. This was the place. The boy, still engrossed in his phone, drifted towards a bench at the centre of the green. Eugenia did not follow directly. She circled, melting into the deeper gloom under a thick-limbed oak tree at the edge of the square. From here, she watched him sit down, his back to her, the pale glow of his screen illuminating the hood of his jacket and the nape of his neck. He was completely still now, utterly absorbed. The patience within her was a deep, cold well. She could wait for an hour. She could wait all night. The waiting was part of the process, the savouring of the moment before the change. She felt the dynamo of her own power hum within her, a quiet, ready thrum of potential energy.

She did not rush. She stepped from under the tree and began the final walk across the wet grass, her bare feet silencing her approach. Twenty yards. Ten. Five. The tinny music grew slightly louder. She could see the logos on his jacket now, the brand name on his trainers. Details of a life that was about to become a detail in hers. He shifted on the bench, stretching his legs, and for a heart-stopping second, she thought he might turn. But he only settled back into his screen, his isolation complete. She was directly behind him now, her shadow falling over him, a larger darkness that swallowed his own. He felt nothing. He suspected nothing. She raised her hand, a large, calloused, powerful thing, and brought it down not on his mouth, but on the back of his head, her fingers wrapping around the thin plastic of his headphones and the skull beneath them.

There was a sharp, brittle crack as the electronics shattered, and the boy’s world was plunged from frantic noise into absolute, terrifying silence. His body went rigid, a jolt of pure shock running through him. Before he could process the sound, before he could even begin to turn, her other arm snaked around his chest, a band of impossible, crushing strength. He was lifted from the bench as if he weighed nothing, his feet kicking uselessly in the air. A small, choked gasp escaped him, the only sound he would make. It was not a scream of terror but a breathless exhalation of surprise, the sound of a dreamer being shaken violently awake into a nightmare from which there was no escape. She felt the frantic, bird-like flutter of his heart against her arm, a brief, wild percussion that faded as she turned from the bench and carried him back into the deep, welcoming shadows of the trees. It was over in less time than it takes to draw a breath.

The silence that followed was profound. The square was empty again, the bench vacant, the only evidence of the boy’s passing a faint, fading patch of warmth on the damp wood. Back in the deep gloom, Eugenia worked with a calm, unhurried efficiency. The act was not one of desecration but of collection. Her fingers, now exquisitely sensitive, moved with a purpose that was both grim and intimate. It was a ritual, a necessary conclusion. She chose her keepsake with the discerning eye of a connoisseur, the small, pristine prize a perfect memento of a flawless hunt. The rest was an unwanted byproduct, a husk to be discarded, and she left it deep within a thicket of thorns and ivy where it would not be found for days, perhaps weeks. There was no pleasure in the act, no cruelty for its own sake. There was only a deep, resonant satisfaction. The hunger was gone, the powerful hum of the dynamo within her quieted, replaced by a profound and placid sense of peace. The job was done. She slipped away, a ghost leaving a grave, her bare feet carrying her silently back through the sleeping streets, a fresh tribute in her hand, on her way to her new, quiet home.### Chapter 5

The journey back to the allotment was a glide of pure contentment. The drizzle had thinned to a fine mist that hung in the air like smoke, and the silence of the suburban streets was deep and absolute. Eugenia moved through it not as an intruder but as the night’s most vital component, her bare feet making no sound on the slick, black tarmac. In her hand, she cupped the small, cooling token of her work, its perfect, unbroken form a source of deep and quiet satisfaction. The world felt correct, its proper order restored. The hunter had fed, the flock had been culled, and the great, silent wheel of existence had turned one more notch. There was no exhilaration, no frantic energy, only a profound and bottomless peace, the peace of a job well and truly done. She was a force of nature that had exerted its will, and the world had rightly yielded.

The dilapidated shed welcomed her with a familiar embrace of damp earth and rust. She slipped through the crooked doorway into its absolute darkness, a sanctum that felt more like home than Arthur’s sterile, brightly lit garage ever had. The garage had been a workshop for a lie, a stage set for a man who didn't exist. This shed was a burrow, a den, a place of primal truth. It smelled of endings and new beginnings, of rot and regeneration. It was a place where things were allowed to be what they truly were, and here, so was she. The single-minded focus that had carried her through the hunt and the collection now softened, replaced by a feeling of secure, proprietary ownership. This was her nest, the centre of her new, honest world.

With the quiet reverence of a priestess tending her relics, she retrieved the pickling jar from its shelf. The glass was cool and solid in her hands. She unscrewed the metal lid, the sound a soft, satisfying hiss of displaced air as the seal was broken. A faint, acrid scent of vinegar and something else, something vaguely metallic, rose to meet her. She looked down into the pale, briny suspension where her congregation of past conquests turned in a slow, suspended dance. They were her history, her rosary beads, the physical evidence of her long and secret life. She opened her other hand and regarded the night’s acquisition. It was flawless, the skin unblemished, a perfect specimen. She dropped it gently into the fluid. There was no splash, only a soft plop. It drifted downwards like a falling leaf, a pale comma in the murky text of the jar, before coming to rest amongst its brethren. She watched it for a long moment, then screwed the lid back on, tight and final. The ritual was complete. Her collection was updated.

A great, boneless weariness, born not of struggle but of consummation, settled deep within her. She did not need a bed or a blanket. In the corner of the shed, a pile of dry, hessian potato sacks lay in a heap. They smelled of dust and dry soil. She curled up on them, her large frame folding with an animal grace, her back pressed against the rough wooden wall of the shed. Sleep came not as a surrender to exhaustion but as a deliberate shutting down of systems, a conscious retreat into a black, restorative void. There were no dreams, no ghosts of Arthur Cate to haunt her rest. There was only the deep, dreamless slumber of a sated predator, a perfect stillness while her body digested, processed, and renewed itself. The pale grey light of a Derry dawn eventually filtered through the grimy panes of the shed's single window, but its weak rays did not touch her. She was a creature of the night, and the day was her time of stone-like sleep.

She awoke as the afternoon light began to fade, the transition from slumber to full awareness as seamless as a predator opening its eyes. The world outside had come alive. She could hear the distant rumble of rush-hour traffic on the Craigavon Bridge, the shouts of children playing in a nearby garden, the drone of a lawnmower. A single police siren wailed in the distance, its mournful cry rising and falling as it cut a path across the city. She listened to it not with fear, but with a remote, intellectual interest. It was the sound of the world reacting to her, the first tremor of the panic she had authored. The newspapers would have a new name tomorrow, another face for a missing person appeal. Another blue pin would be added to the phantom map inside her head, a map she no longer needed a corkboard to see. The siren was not an accusation; it was an ovation.

The deep, resonant peace remained. The hunger was a sleeping leviathan in the deep ocean of her soul. She was content. She knew the peace was temporary, that the hunger would stir, stretch, and eventually rise again, demanding its due. It was a tide, an inescapable cycle, as natural as the setting of the sun. But for now, there was only the calm, the quiet satisfaction, and the patient wait. She rose from her nest of sacks and moved to the shed door, peering out through a narrow crack in the warped wood. The sky was bruising into the familiar, beloved colours of the gloaming. The streetlights flickered on, casting their pools of sodium-orange onto the wet streets. Her territory was waking up for the night. Her time was coming again. The pantry was full, the city was stirring, and she was content to wait.The waiting was a new kind of pleasure, a languid state that Arthur, with his taut, restless energy, could never have countenanced. For him, stillness had been a prelude to action, a moment to study the map and plan the next ride. For Eugenia, stillness was a state of being, a form of quiet dominion. The world turned, the day bled into night, and she was the silent fulcrum around which it all moved. She remained at the door for a long time, watching the patterns of the evening unfold. She saw cars returning home, their headlights sweeping across wet hedges. She saw a woman calling a cat in from the rain. She saw a teenager on a skateboard clatter past, a fleeting comet of noise and motion. She observed them all with the placid, detached interest of a creature watching a river flow by. They were not prey, not yet. They were simply the ambient life of her domain, the scenery against which her own vast, quiet existence was now set.

A new, practical thought surfaced, rising from the useful, cataloguing part of her mind that had once belonged entirely to Arthur. His life, the one he had meticulously maintained on the other side of the river, was a loose thread, a resource yet to be accounted for. His small, barren flat. The money in his bank account. The clothes in his wardrobe. A predator does not waste what it has killed. To leave Arthur’s life un-plundered would be an oversight, an inefficiency. She needed things. A sturdier bag for the jar, perhaps, for the day it might need to be moved. A warmer, less conspicuous jacket than the thin cyclist’s shell she still wore. Cash, for the small, incidental needs of a life that must, on occasion, intersect with the human world. The decision was made without emotion or sentiment. It was a simple, pragmatic calculation. She would go and strip the husk of Arthur Cate’s existence for anything of value.

She slipped out of the allotment, a silent wraith moving through the latticework of back gardens and unlit paths. Her journey across the city was the antithesis of Arthur’s panicked flight hours before. She did not seek the main roads or the sterile, bright arch of the Peace Bridge. She moved through the city’s shadowed arteries, the ginnels and underpasses and forgotten towpaths that were her natural corridors. She felt no fear, no need to hide, only a sense of profound belonging. The city at night was her home, and she moved through it with the effortless confidence of a master in their own house. In the pocket of the thin jacket, her fingers found a small, cold piece of metal: a key. Arthur’s key. The final tool she needed to consume the last remnant of his life.

The apartment building was a drab, anonymous block from the seventies, a place for people who wished to be overlooked. It smelled of boiled cabbage and damp carpets. She climbed the three flights of stairs, her bare feet silent on the worn linoleum, the only human being in the building making no sound at all. The key slid into the lock of apartment 3B with a smooth, oiled click. The flat was exactly as Arthur had left it that morning, a lifetime ago. It was cold, ordered, and profoundly lonely. The air was stale with the faint scents of his life: dried tea leaves, metal polish, and the faint, acidic tang of his constant, simmering anxiety. To Eugenia, it was the smell of a cage, and she felt a faint, instinctual revulsion. She did not turn on the lights. She moved through the small rooms in the thin grey light filtering through the windows, a predator methodically stripping a kill. In the bedroom, she pulled a thick, dark wool coat from the wardrobe. In the kitchen, she found a sturdy canvas satchel. From a tin box in a drawer, she took a thick wad of cash, Arthur’s emergency fund. She worked with a silent, emotionless efficiency, her every movement one of pure, practical purpose. She was not a ghost haunting a home; she was a liquidator, settling the estate of a dead man.Her work in the bedroom and kitchen was done. As she moved through the small living room, her final sweep of the premises was cursory, driven by a parsimonious instinct not to waste. Her gaze fell upon a small shelf where a few silver-plated cups from amateur cycling races glinted dully in the gloom. Arthur had polished them every Sunday. He had cherished them as proof of his discipline, his endurance, his ability to conquer distance and gradient through sheer force of will. Eugenia regarded them as one might regard the fossilised toys of an extinct creature. They held no sentiment, no echo of triumph. They were merely bits of shaped, worthless metal, monuments to a small and pointless life. She did not touch them, leaving them to gather the dust he had so diligently fought against.

As she turned to leave, she passed the full-length mirror fixed to the back of the front door. For a moment, she paused, not out of vanity or curiosity, but with the blank, assessing stillness of an animal that has caught a flicker of unexpected movement. The man who stared back was pale and gaunt, his eyes wide and dark in a face that looked hollowed out by a private, gnawing fever. He wore a thin, technical jacket over a frame that was all sharp angles and taut lines. It was Arthur Cate, exactly as he had been. Eugenia felt a flicker of profound cognitive dissonance, a momentary glitch in her seamless new reality. The image in the glass was a falsehood, a cheap forgery. The being she knew herself to be was vast, powerful, and timeless; the creature in the mirror was a frail, frightened man, a temporary vessel on the verge of shattering. She felt a distant, academic pity for him, and a stronger wave of contempt. She was the vast, dark reality; he was the faint, unreliable reflection. She turned away from the mirror without a second glance, dismissing the lie it told.

She slipped on the heavy wool coat. Its weight was comforting, a substantial barrier against a world she no longer needed a barrier against. It felt more appropriate, more real, than the feather-light synthetics Arthur had favoured. She slung the canvas satchel over her shoulder, the lump of cash a dense, satisfying weight within it. She was equipped. She pulled the door open, stepped into the stale, cabbage-scented hallway, and gently pulled the door closed behind her. The quiet click of the latch was the final punctuation on the life of Arthur Cate. She did not bother to use the key to lock it. The flat was no longer hers to secure. It was just a place, an empty box that had once held a man. What happened to it now was of no consequence. She dropped the key onto the worn doormat and walked away, her bare feet utterly silent on the stairs.

Back in the night, she was a different entity. The coat and bag gave her a new silhouette, a new anonymity. She was no longer an anomaly in cycling gear, but a plausible shadow, a faceless shape of the city night, unburdened by specific purpose. She moved with an even greater sense of belonging, the weight of the coat a constant, grounding presence. The wind felt less sharp against the thick wool, and she found she missed the bite of it on her skin, but it was a minor inconvenience, a necessary concession to the practicalities of camouflage. She was adapting, evolving into a more effective urban predator, shedding the last eccentricities of her former life for the brutalist pragmatism of her true one. The journey back to the Waterside was swift and silent, a dark river flowing back to its source.

The shed felt more like home than the flat ever could. She placed the canvas bag in the corner, a small cache of supplies for a life that now required very little. The deep, sated peace had not left her. It was a vast, placid lake within her, the surface utterly still. She settled into her corner on the pile of hessian sacks, the rough texture a comfort, the scent of earth and decay a familiar perfume. The hunger was a sleeping leviathan in the deep ocean of her soul. She knew, with a certainty that was as deep and natural as her own breathing, that the lake would not remain placid forever. The rhythms of the city, the cycles of the moon, the simple, biochemical imperative of her own body would eventually stir the depths. The leviathan would wake, and its hunger would need to be honoured. She was not afraid of its waking. She did not dread it. It was, after all, the most honest part of her. She would simply wait for its call, ready and content in her new, dark truth.### Chapter 6

The days that followed fell into a rhythm of profound and placid emptiness. Eugenia’s existence simplified to a primal duality: the stone-like, subterranean sleep of the day and the cool, silent awareness of the night. Her den in the derelict allotment shed was a womb of damp earth and shadow, insulating her from the frantic, sunlit world. She would sink into a slumber so deep it was a kind of temporary death, her consciousness submerged beneath layers of black, dreamless quiet. The sounds of the day—the distant wail of ambulances, the cheerful shouts of playing children, the rhythmic thump of a neighbour’s hammer—were merely faint, sub-aquatic pressures on the shell of her hibernation, signifying nothing. The true start of her day was the gloaming, when the fading light would seep through the grimy window and trigger a slow, graceful return to full consciousness, her powerful limbs uncoiling from the nest of hessian sacks with a silent, fluid purpose.

Her needs were few. The hunger, for now, was a sleeping god, and she had no impulse to disturb it. But other, more practical instincts remained. One evening, driven by a scavenger’s impulse to know her territory, she drifted through the back alleys behind a row of shops. In a large bin behind a newsagent’s, amidst the discarded cardboard and rotting food, lay a copy of the *Derry Journal*. The paper was a day old, slightly damp but still legible. She carried it back to her shed, not with the furtive haste of a thief, but with the calm deliberation of a landowner collecting a survey map of her estate. She smoothed it out on the earthen floor, the sharp, chemical smell of the newsprint a jarring note in the organic decay of her den.

The headline was stark, printed in a thick, black font designed to convey gravity and alarm: “CITY GRIPPED BY FEAR AS SECOND MAN VANISHES.” Beneath it, two photographs were printed side-by-side. On the left was the boy from the Waterside bench. It was a school photograph, his hair unnaturally neat, his smile forced and awkward. He looked like a stranger. On the right, however, was a face she knew with a horrifying, cellular intimacy. It was Arthur Cate, caught mid-race, his face a mask of gaunt determination, squinting against a sun he could no longer feel. He looked pathetic, a creature of sinew and desperation, and she felt a flicker of cold, dispassionate contempt for the man she had been. The world had noticed her work, and in their clumsy, blind way, they had made Arthur Cate a part of it.

She read the article with a detached, scholarly interest. It spoke of a community on edge, of frightened parents and a police force "exploring all possible lines of inquiry." It detailed the discovery of the boy’s abandoned phone. And then it moved on to the second disappearance. It described Arthur as a "quiet, solitary individual" and mentioned that his colleagues at the city library had raised the alarm when he failed to appear for work. It spoke of the discovery of his garage, the door forced open, and the “bizarre scene” within, where his expensive racing bicycle was found “methodically dismantled.” The police, the article suggested, were investigating a possible link, treating Arthur Cate as another victim of the same shadowy trouble that had claimed the boy.

The irony was not lost on her. Arthur, the hunter, memorialised as the hunted. It was a perfect camouflage, a gift from the blundering, imaginative minds of the people she preyed upon. Their fear was making her invisible. And yet, the article contained a seed of risk. They were in his space. They had been in the garage. They had seen the dismantled bike. She pictured the scene with perfect clarity: the neat rows of components, the stripped frame. And on the wall, dominating the entire space, was the map. The confession. Her diary, written in a language of coloured pins that only she could fully comprehend. To the police, it would be an enigma, the strange obsession of a peculiar man. But an enigma invites scrutiny. A loose thread begs to be pulled. And Eugenia, in her new, clean existence, would tolerate no loose threads.

A new purpose settled over her, as clear and cold as her decision to cross the bridge. The garage had to be purged. The map, that last great monument to Arthur's fractured mind, had to be utterly destroyed. It was not a matter of panic, but of hygiene. It was the final act of erasing the man she had been, a tidying up of the last, messy remnants of his life. She stood, the newspaper rustling at her feet, and pulled on the heavy wool coat. The canvas satchel was empty now, save for the small, hard lump of a box of matches she had taken from Arthur’s kitchen drawer. She slipped out of the allotment, the setting crescent moon a sharp, silver claw in the darkening sky. She was crossing the river again, but this time she was not running from herself, nor was she hunting for another. She was returning to the scene of her own creation, a quiet and methodical god returning to her laboratory to sterilise the equipment.The crossing was a silent pilgrimage in reverse. She did not seek the bright, open span of the Peace Bridge, but followed the river’s edge to the shadowed underbelly of the Craigavon Bridge, a hulking, two-tiered brute of iron and concrete. Here, in the deep gloom between massive pillars graffiti-scarred and smelling of damp and diesel, she crossed the Foyle unseen. The roar of the traffic on the deck above was a canopy of white noise that rendered her passage utterly secret. Arthur would have hated it here; he craved the open air and the clean line of the horizon. Eugenia, however, felt at home in the compression and the dark, the thundering noise a cloak of invisibility. She emerged on the city-side and flowed into the familiar warren of streets, a ghost returning to its own grave to perform a final, necessary desecration.

The alley was just as she had left it. The grotesquely buckled garage door hung from its hinge like a broken jaw. A single strand of blue and white police tape, stretched across the opening, had been torn and now flapped in the light breeze, a pathetic and failed attempt at containment. She slipped under it without disturbing its sad dance. The air inside the garage struck her instantly. The old, familiar smells of oil, rubber, and cold concrete were still there, but they were now overlaid with a new, foreign scent—the faint, soapy aroma of aftershave, the sour tang of lukewarm coffee, the generic human smell of the policemen who had stood in this space, looking for clues to a puzzle whose shape they could not even begin to imagine. They had been here. They had breathed this air. Their presence was a contamination, a violation of what had once been a sacred, if conflicted, space.

Her gaze swept over the neatly arranged components of the dismantled bicycle, the inert skeleton of Arthur’s former life, before settling on the far wall. The map. It dominated the space, a madman’s tapestry woven from paper, ink, and coloured plastic. In the gloom, it looked like a diagram of a diseased nervous system, the pins glowing like septic synapses. The constellations of terror Arthur had so obsessively plotted were all there, a perfect record of her secret history. She walked towards it, her bare feet silent on the gritty floor, and stood before it not as a penitent before a confession, but as an archivist reviewing a flawed and sentimental early work. It was a document of his struggle, his pain, his pathetic inability to accept the glorious truth of his own nature. The logic he had tried to apply, the routes he had traced, had all been predicated on the lie that the hunter was an external force. It was almost pitiable.

She did not bother to pull the map down. That would have been an act of rage or frustration. Her purpose was colder, more absolute. From the pocket of her coat, she took the small box of matches. She struck one, the flare of the sulphur head a brief, violent star in the darkness. She held the small flame to the bottom-right corner of the map, to the cluster of pins marking St. Columb’s Park. The dry paper curled, browned, and then caught with a soft whoosh. The flame began its slow, inexorable journey upwards, a hungry orange tongue licking at the edges of the Bogside. The plastic heads of the pins began to sizzle and melt, dripping down the wall in thick, colourful tears. Red for the rising hunger, blue for the kill, yellow for the clues—all rendered into meaningless, molten slag. The fire consumed streets and landmarks, bridges and housing estates, turning her entire predatory cartography into a cascade of black, floating ash.

The last of the paper turned to a fragile, glowing ember before crumbling into nothing. All that remained was the corkboard, scorched black in a ragged rectangle, and a few stubbornly embedded metal pin-shafts, their plastic heads melted away. The garage was filled with the sharp, acrid smell of smoke, a funereal incense that finally overpowered the lingering scents of both Arthur’s life and the policemen’s intrusion. The space was cleansed. It was neutralised. The last, most dangerous piece of evidence, the final echo of Arthur Cate’s tortured psyche, was gone. Eugenia stood for a moment in the smoky darkness, feeling the absolute finality of the act. The last chain had been broken. The last thread snipped. She was untethered, undocumented, a perfect and immaculate secret. With her work completed, she turned without a backward glance and slipped out into the night, leaving the empty, smoke-filled tomb behind her forever.The smoke from the immolated map did not cling to her as she left the alley. It was the scent of a funeral she had attended as a stranger, a rite that had no personal meaning. The night air, when she stepped back into it, felt cleaner, thinner, stripped of the historical weight that had always seemed to hang over the city. With the map gone, her own internal geography had been wiped clean. There were no longer red, blue, and yellow pins studding her memory; there were no longer sites of significance, places of triumph or near-misses. The entire city, from the ancient walls to the newest housing estate, had been rendered into a uniform, undifferentiated territory. It was all simply her hunting ground, its past erased, its future a blank and inviting canvas. She felt a lightness that was entirely new, a perfect, untroubled freedom that the sated peace, profound as it was, had not quite contained. The last anchor had been raised, and she was adrift on a dark, endless ocean of possibility.

She did not retrace her steps to the river. Instinct, unburdened by plan or purpose, guided her feet into the deep labyrinth of the Bogside. She moved with an aimless, exploratory grace, a sovereign wandering the quiet corridors of her palace after a successful coup. It was here, turning a corner onto a street of low, dark houses, that she saw the pulse of blue light. A police car was parked by the curb, its engine idling, its rotating lights painting the wet walls and slick road in silent, rhythmic flashes of colour. Her first impulse was not fear, but a cold, predatory curiosity. She slipped into the absolute blackness of a recessed doorway, a patch of shadow the flashing lights could not penetrate, and watched. Two officers sat inside the car, their faces weary and pale in the intermittent glow of the dash-cam monitor. They were parked directly opposite a narrow ginnel where, a lifetime ago, Arthur had found an oversized footprint in the mud and hammered a yellow pin into his corkboard.

One of the officers, the one in the passenger seat, rubbed his face with both hands, a gesture of profound exhaustion. She could hear their voices faintly through the closed window, the words muffled but the tone of weary frustration unmistakable. "...nothing. It’s like we’re chasing ghosts." The other officer grunted in agreement, staring out into the empty, rain-swept street. They were looking for a person, a culprit with a motive, a history, a trail. They were searching for a criminal. They could not begin to comprehend that what they were hunting was a condition of the city itself, a feature of the landscape, as elemental and un-catchable as the drizzle that beaded on their windscreen. In that moment, watching their futile vigil, Eugenia understood her true nature with a clarity that was almost blinding. She was not a monster hiding among them. She was a fundamental truth they were not equipped to see. Her safety was absolute, guaranteed not by her stealth or her cleverness, but by their sheer lack of imagination. They were looking for a man, and the man was already gone. With a final, silent assessment of the tired, earthbound creatures in their metal box, she detached herself from the shadow and flowed away into the darkness, leaving them to their ghost hunt, secure in the knowledge that she was, and always would be, utterly and completely invisible.The security she felt was as vast and profound as the night itself. Leaving the police to their futile task, she drifted deeper into the city's heart, her path now entirely without destination. Before, every step had been a calculation—an approach, a retreat, a patrol. Now, it was simply movement for its own sake, the pure, physical joy of a body perfectly attuned to its environment. The texture of the world communicated itself through the soles of her bare feet: the smooth, cold slickness of pavement, the gritty bite of a cobbled alley, the soft, yielding dampness of a patch of moss growing in the crack of a wall. She was reading the city not as a map, but as a blind mystic reads a sacred text, through touch and instinct alone.

Her aimless wandering led her upwards, following the ancient, winding paths that climbed towards the city's famous walls. She emerged onto the wide, stone promenade, the highest point of the old fortifications, a place where cannons had once kept watch. Below her, Derry spread out in a glittering, complex web. The Foyle was a ribbon of black ink dividing the two halves of her kingdom. The twin bridges, Craigavon and the Peace, were stitched with moving lights. From this height, the city was an abstract pattern, a living circuit board pulsing with the low-energy currents of a million sleeping lives. She was no longer down in the maze; she was above it, seeing its entire design in a single, all-encompassing glance. Arthur had only ever seen the routes; Eugenia now saw the system.

Her gaze drifted, settling on a row of houses whose back gardens abutted the old walls. In one, an upstairs window was brightly lit. A young woman was standing in the frame, brushing her long hair with slow, rhythmic strokes, her silhouette stark against the warm yellow light. She was unaware of the vast, dark history that soaked the very stones she lived beside, unaware of the new chapter of that history standing only fifty yards away, watching her ritual. Eugenia watched without a flicker of hunger, her assessment purely aesthetic, like a naturalist observing the preening habits of a particular species. She saw the predictable arc of the brush, the slight tilt of the head, the vulnerability of a creature safe in its nest. She logged the image, the time, the location, not as a plan, but as a simple data point in the grand, unfolding equation of her world.

A faint, cool breeze whispered across the ramparts, carrying the distant smell of the river and the even more distant salt tang of the sea. The feeling of absolute rightness, of a perfect and harmonious alignment with the universe, was complete. The world was orderly, its inhabitants bound by patterns of habit and biology that made them as predictable as the tides. The hunger, she could feel it now, was not a chaotic invader but a part of that same, vast tidal system. It was dormant now, in its neap phase, but the gravitational pull of time and need would inevitably draw it out again. She felt no anxiety at this knowledge, only a deep and abiding calm. She was a force of nature, and nature was, above all else, patient. She could stand on these walls for a night or a year, a silent, eternal guardian of her own dark covenant, waiting for the turning of the tide.### Chapter 7

The city wore the autumn with a kind of weary resignation. The persistent drizzle of summer hardened into a colder, more insistent rain that fell in rattling sheets, turning the River Foyle a churning, agitated slate-grey. The leaves in St. Columb’s Park turned, blazed, and then fell, plastering themselves to the wet pavements in thick, decaying mats. For Eugenia, the passage of time was not a matter of days on a calendar but of these slow, inexorable shifts in the character of her territory. She watched the season turn from her den in the allotment, from the shadowed ramparts of the old city walls, and from the deep gloom beneath its bridges. The nights grew longer, deeper, and more absolute, a gift that she accepted with a quiet, elemental gratitude. The city’s inhabitants retreated deeper into themselves, their collars turned up, their heads bowed, their hurried movements between pools of light making them look more than ever like anxious, scurrying prey.

Her new existence was one of monastic simplicity and profound awareness. She had no need for the frantic plotting that had consumed Arthur. The map of coloured pins had been a crude and clumsy tool, an attempt to impose a static, two-dimensional logic onto a fluid, four-dimensional reality. Eugenia’s understanding of the city was now instinctive, a living cartography woven from scent, sound, and the subtle temporal rhythms of human behaviour. She learned the city’s pulse: the rumble of the first bread delivery van before dawn, the pattern of security patrols around the new university campus, the specific nights when the pubs in the city centre disgorged their loud, unsteady patrons into the streets, the quiet exodus of the late-shift nurses from the hospital, their exhaustion a palpable scent on the cold air. She was no longer hunting specific targets; she was studying an ecosystem, and her knowledge of its habits and vulnerabilities was becoming absolute.

On one of her silent, wandering nights, she found herself near the perimeter of a prestigious grammar school, a place surrounded by a new, high-security fence. A flicker from Arthur’s archived mind, useless to him but valuable to her, recalled a detail from a planning application he had once processed at the library. It mentioned a Victorian-era drainage culvert, too historically significant to remove but too small for modern machinery to clear. She followed the fence line to where a dense thicket of rhododendron grew against the stone wall, and there, almost completely obscured by earth and tangled roots, was the arch of the culvert. The iron grille that had once covered it was a lacework of rust that crumbled to powder at her touch. It was a dark, narrow throat leading into the heart of the school grounds, a secret door into a fenced pasture. She did not use it, not yet, but she logged its existence. The city was full of such secrets, and Arthur, her unwitting librarian, had catalogued so many of them for her.

The profound, sated peace began to thin, not with a sudden tear, but with a slow, almost imperceptible erosion, like a riverbank softening after a long flood. It began as a change in the quality of her perception. The scent of hot chips from a late-night takeaway, once mere data, now carried a phantom sensation of warmth, of salt, of living flesh. The sight of a young couple embracing in a doorway, their breath mingling in a shared cloud of steam, triggered a faint, clinical assessment of their tangled limbs, their exposed necks. The quiet, solitary figures she observed started to seem less like abstract shapes and more like vessels of kinetic energy, their heartbeats faint but distinct signals in the quiet dark. The great, sleeping leviathan of her hunger was not waking, but it had begun to stir in its deep slumber, its slow turn disturbing the placid surface of her soul.

The final shift came without drama, as a quiet and logical conclusion. She was perched in the branches of a sycamore tree overlooking a bus shelter, the rain dripping from the leaves around her. A bus pulled up with a hiss of air brakes, and a lone girl disembarked. She was talking animatedly on her phone, laughing at something being said on the other end, her voice a bright, sharp thread of sound in the damp air. The sound did not trigger a frenzy. It did not ignite a fire. It simply clarified a need. The peace had been a period of rest and digestion, a fallow season. But a field cannot lie fallow forever. The system required input. The cycle demanded to be honoured. The girl’s laughter was not a temptation; it was a simple, biological signal, as clear as the scent of rain or the pull of the moon. Her laughter was life, and life was food.

The bus pulled away, its red tail-lights disappearing around a bend, leaving the girl alone in the small pool of light. A profound and simple purpose descended upon Eugenia, displacing the last remnants of her placid stillness. The waiting was over. She dropped from the tree with the silent weight of a leopard, her bare feet landing on the soft turf of the verge without a whisper. She did not hurry. There was no need. The girl was still on her phone, still laughing, walking slowly away from the shelter into a stretch of unlit pavement between two lampposts. She was a perfect vector, moving from a point of safety to a point of absolute vulnerability. Eugenia began to follow, her long, effortless stride eating up the distance. Her senses were honed to a razor’s edge, the world rendered in exquisitely sharp detail, every sensation a part of the simple, clean, and inevitable process that was now unfolding. Her patient watch was over. The hunt had begun.The girl was a bubble of warmth and sound moving through the cold, quiet dark. Her laughter, bright and staccato, was a flagrant broadcast of life, an unwitting invitation. Eugenia did not stalk so much as converge, her path a line of perfect predatory geometry calculated to intercept the girl’s meandering trajectory. The wet tarmac was a silken runner beneath her bare feet, the chill a welcome, clarifying sensation. Her every sense was focused on the bubble of noise ahead, not with the frantic energy of a hungry animal, but with the calm, focused attention of a master craftsman approaching a delicate and important piece of work. The world outside the immediate vectors of the hunt had ceased to exist; there was only the hunter, the prey, and the rapidly shrinking space between them.

The girl ambled into the long, dark patch of pavement between the two distant streetlights, a space of profound shadow that Eugenia had already marked as the ideal theatre for her work. The girl’s voice, tinny and distorted by the phone’s speaker, carried clearly in the still air. “No, he actually said that? Oh my God, I would have died…” Her words trailed off into another peel of laughter, a sound of pure, untroubled delight. For Eugenia, the sound was not a human expression of joy but a simple, physical tremor in the air, a vibration that signaled the peak vitality of her quarry. She glided into the darkness behind the girl, a shadow detaching itself from the greater shadows, her form utterly lost against the backdrop of wet hedges and black brickwork. The moment was perfect, the conditions ideal, the outcome a foregone conclusion.

She closed the final few feet in two silent, fluid strides. Her first movement was not one of violence, but of surgical precision. Her left hand, large and swift, came up and over the girl’s own, enveloping the phone. Her thumb found the side of the device, depressing the power button and plunging the screen into blackness. The line went dead. The bright, warm world of conversation and connection was severed with a single, silent click. The girl made a small, frustrated noise, “Hey, I think my phone just—” and in that same instant, Eugenia’s other hand clamped over her mouth, not with a frantic slap, but with a firm, encompassing pressure that sealed her lips and swallowed the end of her sentence. The girl’s body went rigid with a shock that was too sudden and absolute for terror. Before her brain could even begin to process the violation, she was lifted from her feet by an arm that wrapped around her ribs with the inexorable strength of a hydraulic press, her light weight an irrelevance.

The street was empty again. The entire event, from the death of the phone call to the girl’s disappearance from the pavement, had taken less than five seconds. All that remained was a profound and sudden silence where laughter had been moments before. Eugenia carried the girl into the deep, tangled blackness of a public garden that bordered the road, her passage through the overgrown shrubbery as silent as a breath of wind. She moved with an unhurried, almost serene purpose, the slight, frantic struggles of the body in her arms diminishing with each passing second, the fight draining away as the horrifying reality of her captor’s impossible strength became clear. She laid the girl down on a bed of damp, fallen leaves behind a thick curtain of ivy, a place of deep and total privacy. The brief, desperate struggle was over, leaving only a chilling stillness.

In the sacred quiet of her makeshift larder, Eugenia performed the familiar, necessary ritual. Her hands moved with a calm, practiced detachment, her actions clean and efficient. This was not an act of passion or rage; it was the quiet, meticulous work of a collector, a biologist, a priestess tending to the rites of her faith. The selection was made, a perfect token to commemorate a perfect hunt, and secured away in a deep pocket of her wool coat. The rest was now merely a shell, an empty vessel. She concealed it with care, pulling branches and a thick carpet of ivy over the form, returning it to the earth from which it had come. There was no remorse, no guilt, no feeling at all save for the return of the deep, placid hum of contentment. The leviathan had been fed, its demands met with skill and grace. The tide of hunger receded, leaving behind the vast, tranquil ocean of her peace. She rose, brushed a leaf from her coat, and melted back into the night, her work for the season done, her great and patient watch ready to begin anew.The journey back to the allotment was a glide of pure contentment. The drizzle had thinned to a fine mist that hung in the air like smoke, and the silence of the suburban streets was deep and absolute. Eugenia moved through it not as an intruder but as the night’s most vital component, her bare feet making no sound on the slick, black tarmac. In her hand, she cupped the small, cooling token of her work, its perfect, unbroken form a source of deep and quiet satisfaction. The world felt correct, its proper order restored. The hunter had fed, the flock had been culled, and the great, silent wheel of existence had turned one more notch. There was no exhilaration, no frantic energy, only a profound and bottomless peace, the peace of a job well and truly done. She was a force of nature that had exerted its will, and the world had rightly yielded.

The dilapidated shed welcomed her with a familiar embrace of damp earth and rust. She slipped through the crooked doorway into its absolute darkness, a sanctum that felt more like home than Arthur’s sterile, brightly lit garage ever had. The garage had been a workshop for a lie, a stage set for a man who didn't exist. This shed was a burrow, a den, a place of primal truth. It smelled of endings and new beginnings, of rot and regeneration. It was a place where things were allowed to be what they truly were, and here, so was she. The single-minded focus that had carried her through the hunt and the collection now softened, replaced by a feeling of secure, proprietary ownership. This was her nest, the centre of her new, honest world.

With the quiet reverence of a priestess tending her relics, she retrieved the pickling jar from its shelf. The glass was cool and solid in her hands. She unscrewed the metal lid, the sound a soft, satisfying hiss of displaced air as the seal was broken. A faint, acrid scent of vinegar and something else, something vaguely metallic, rose to meet her. She looked down into the pale, briny suspension where her congregation of past conquests turned in a slow, suspended dance. They were her history, her rosary beads, the physical evidence of her long and secret life. She opened her other hand and regarded the night’s acquisition. It was flawless, the skin unblemished, a perfect specimen. She dropped it gently into the fluid. There was no splash, only a soft plop. It drifted downwards like a falling leaf, a pale comma in the murky text of the jar, before coming to rest amongst its brethren. She watched it for a long moment, then screwed the lid back on, tight and final. The ritual was complete. Her collection was updated.

A great, boneless weariness, born not of struggle but of consummation, settled deep within her. She did not need a bed or a blanket. In the corner of the shed, a pile of dry, hessian potato sacks lay in a heap. They smelled of dust and dry soil. She curled up on them, her large frame folding with an animal grace, her back pressed against the rough wooden wall of the shed. Sleep came not as a surrender to exhaustion but as a deliberate shutting down of systems, a conscious retreat into a black, restorative void. There were no dreams, no ghosts of Arthur Cate to haunt her rest. There was only the deep, dreamless slumber of a sated predator, a perfect stillness while her body digested, processed, and renewed itself. The pale grey light of a Derry dawn eventually filtered through the grimy panes of the shed's single window, but its weak rays did not touch her. She was a creature of the night, and the day was her time of stone-like sleep.

She awoke as the afternoon light began to fade, the transition from slumber to full awareness as seamless as a predator opening its eyes. The world outside had come alive. She could hear the distant rumble of rush-hour traffic on the Craigavon Bridge, the shouts of children playing in a nearby garden, the drone of a lawnmower. A single police siren wailed in the distance, its mournful cry rising and falling as it cut a path across the city. She listened to it not with fear, but with a remote, intellectual interest. It was the sound of the world reacting to her, the first tremor of the panic she had authored. The newspapers would have a new name tomorrow, another face for a missing person appeal. Another blue pin would be added to the phantom map inside her head, a map she no longer needed a corkboard to see. The siren was not an accusation; it was an ovation.

The deep, resonant peace remained. The hunger was a sleeping leviathan in the deep ocean of her soul. She was content. She knew the peace was temporary, that the hunger would stir, stretch, and eventually rise again, demanding its due. It was a tide, an inescapable cycle, as natural as the setting of the sun. But for now, there was only the calm, the quiet satisfaction, and the patient wait. She rose from her nest of sacks and moved to the shed door, peering out through a narrow crack in the warped wood. The sky was bruising into the familiar, beloved colours of the gloaming. The streetlights flickered on, casting their pools of sodium-orange onto the wet streets. Her territory was waking up for the night. Her time was coming again. The pantry was full, the city was stirring, and she was content to wait.### Chapter 8

The city’s fear was a tangible thing, a new texture in the autumn air. Eugenia could taste it, a sharp, metallic tang of adrenaline and suspicion that clung to the evening mist. The *Derry Journal*, which she now collected with the regularity of a subscriber, had given her a name. She was "The Creeper," a headline-friendly moniker that was both sensational and hopelessly inadequate. The newspapers were filled with blurry CCTV images of her last victim walking away from the bus, and with increasingly desperate appeals from the police. A voluntary curfew was settling over the city; parents drove their teenage children to destinations they would once have walked, and the formerly boisterous groups of youths who congregated on street corners had vanished, retreating into the warm, bright confines of their homes. To Eugenia, this was not a tightening of the net, but a fascinating behavioural shift in the herd. Fear was making them predictable, routing them along safer, more brightly lit corridors, and paradoxically, making the shadows in between even deeper and more absolute.

Her sated peace held, a deep and placid reservoir within her. The increased police presence was a minor alteration to the nocturnal landscape, their high-visibility jackets and slow-moving patrol cars acting as clumsy, predictable beacons that were easily avoided. Her confidence, already absolute, deepened into a state of serene invincibility. She was a fundamental law of the city, and the frantic activities of its inhabitants were no more a threat to her than a flock of startled birds is to the sky through which they fly. She continued her silent observations, her knowledge of the city’s hidden ways growing with each passing night, her mental map becoming a three-dimensional, living schematic of her dominion. She knew which gates were left unlocked, which walls had footholds, which rooftops were accessible, her mind a perfect synthesis of Arthur’s meticulous, detail-oriented memory and her own fluid, predatory instincts.

The sanctity of her slumber was breached not by the sirens of the outside world, but by a sound from within. One afternoon, as she lay in the deepest part of her restorative hibernation, a noise, faint but shockingly close, penetrated the layers of her unconsciousness. It was not a sound of the city; it was the dry, scraping footstep of a human presence within the overgrown confines of the allotment itself. She did not jolt awake. Her return to awareness was a slow, cold tide rising within her, a silent unfurling from a state of non-being into one of absolute, watchful stillness. Her senses came online first—smell and sound. The scent of woodsmoke, thin and acrid. The clink of a bottle against stone. Her den, her sanctum, had been violated. A profound, cold anger, utterly devoid of heat or passion, began to crystallize within her.

Through a small knot-hole in the shed’s decaying wood, she observed the intruder. He was a man, but not in any way that registered as prey. He was old, his face a collapsed ruin of grime and grey stubble, his body wrapped in a cocoon of mismatched, filthy garments. He had established a pathetic camp in the skeletal remains of a neighbouring greenhouse, a small fire of scavenged twigs sputtering weakly against the damp air. He was vermin, an infestation in her larder, a rival creature of the margins that had blundered into the wrong territory. She watched him for an hour as the daylight faded, her mind a cold engine of calculation. Killing him was an option, of course, but it would be a messy, unnecessary act. He was not a trophy to be collected, merely a problem to be removed. His death would create a different kind of disturbance, a body that was not a clean disappearance but a crude, common murder. It was an inelegant solution, and Eugenia, in all things, was an artist of elegance.

She waited until the last vestiges of twilight had bled from the sky, leaving the allotment in a profound and utter blackness. The man’s small fire cast a weak, flickering glow, a tiny island of warmth in the cold dark. She did not need to be stealthy; the night was her element. She simply emerged from her shed and walked towards him, her bare feet making no sound on the damp earth. The man was hunched over his fire, muttering to himself as he attempted to warm a can of soup. He did not hear her approach, did not sense her presence until she stopped in the broken doorway of the greenhouse, her form blocking what little moonlight there was, casting him into an even deeper shadow. He looked up, his eyes squinting, his mouth opening to issue a gruff, territorial challenge.

The words died in his throat. What he saw was not a person. It was a shape, a column of absolute darkness cloaked in heavy wool, preternaturally still and utterly silent. There was no aggression in its posture, no threat, but its stillness was more terrifying than any weapon. He was confronted by a void, a silent, watching presence that did not belong to the world of men, of cops or junkies or thugs he knew how to handle. Its silence was an active force, a pressure that squeezed the air from his lungs. He felt the primal, animal terror of a creature that has stumbled into the den of a predator far older and more powerful than itself. All his life’s accumulated toughness, the hard shell he had grown to survive on the streets, cracked and fell away, leaving him utterly exposed.

He began to babble, the words tumbling out in a panicked, servile stream. “Sorry… sorry, mister… didn’t know this was your spot… just looking for a place out of the rain… I’m going, I’m going now…” He scrambled to his feet, kicking over his soup, his hands shaking as he gathered his pathetic belongings—a plastic bag, a stained blanket. Eugenia did not move. She did not speak. She simply stood, a statue carved from shadow and cold intent, and watched him. Her lack of reaction was the most terrifying thing of all. He fled, scrambling through the broken glass of the greenhouse, not daring to look back, and vanished into the night, a creature driven from its territory not by violence, but by the sheer, unendurable presence of a superior and utterly alien being.

Eugenia remained in the doorway for a long time after he had gone, listening until the last sound of his panicked flight had faded completely. The air in the allotment felt fouled, tainted by the scent of his fear and his cheap tobacco. Her sanctuary had been breached, its perfect solitude violated. The experience left a residue, a faint but persistent disquiet. The world had intruded. While she was invisible to the forces of order, she was not invisible to the desperate and the marginal, the other creatures that lived in the city’s hidden corners. The thought settled in her mind with the cold, heavy weight of a stone: this place was temporary. It was vulnerable. A new, long-term strategic imperative began to form, a plan for a deeper and more permanent security. She needed a true lair, a place not merely hidden on the surface, but buried deep within the city’s ancient bones. A place of stone and darkness and absolute, unbreachable silence. A tomb.### Chapter 8

The taint of the vagrant lingered in the allotment long after he had fled, a sour miasma of fear and unwashed living that fouled the clean, organic scent of her sanctuary. The shed, once a den of perfect solitude, now felt compromised, its sanctity breached by the clumsy intrusion of the mundane world. Her sated peace, the vast, placid lake within her, was disturbed not by the return of hunger, but by the cold, clear recognition of vulnerability. The world of men, in its desperation, had a way of stumbling into the dark places, and her current home was simply not dark enough. This was not a panic, but a problem of logistics and long-term security. A new nest was not just desirable; it was a strategic necessity.

Her search did not begin with a physical exploration of the city. It began in the silent, internal archive of Arthur Cate’s mind. He had been a librarian, a meticulous custodian of facts, and his brain was a perfectly indexed repository of Derry’s history, its architecture, its hidden infrastructure. Sinking into a state of deep concentration, Eugenia bypassed the man’s anxieties and emotions and accessed the raw data. She sifted through mental folders containing geological surveys, architectural blueprints of historic buildings, academic papers on the city’s siege-era fortifications, and decades of municipal planning documents. She was a scholar of her own territory, her research conducted in the absolute silence of her own skull.

She evaluated and discarded possibilities with cold efficiency. The old siege tunnels were too well-known to historians and urban explorers. The industrial ruins along the river were subject to redevelopment plans and periodic security patrols. The vast, modern sewer system was too loud, too active, a place of effluent, not silence. Her focus narrowed, drawn inexorably to the city’s ecclesiastical foundations. The great stone churches were built for eternity, their foundations sunk deep into the bedrock, their crypts and cellars a labyrinth of forgotten, consecrated ground. They were places designed to house the dead, built by men who understood the value of stone and silence. And at the heart of it all, a black sun of possibility, was St. Columb's Cathedral, the city’s oldest and most formidable structure, its stone spire a permanent anchor pinning the city to the earth.

That evening, she moved through the city with a new, singular purpose. It was not a hunt; it was a reconnaissance mission. The cathedral rose before her as she approached, a massive edifice of dark stone whose gothic spires seemed to scratch at the low, bruised sky. The floodlights at its base cast deep, dramatic shadows, making it look less like a house of worship and more like a vast, skeletal fortress. To Arthur, it had been a landmark, a symbol of a faith he did not share. To Eugenia, it was a magnificent shell, a potential carapace of immense strength and perfect solitude. She felt no awe, only a cool, professional appreciation for its structure. This was a fortress of silence, a citadel of death, and she had come to inspect its foundations.

She began a slow, silent circuit of the great building’s perimeter, her bare feet making no sound on the ancient, rain-slicked flagstones of the churchyard. She ignored the grand, arched doorways and the huge, luminous stained-glass windows. She was not looking for an entrance; she was looking for a flaw, a forgotten artery, a secret path into the building’s stone heart. Her eyes, adapted to near-perfect darkness, scanned the lower courses of the stonework, the places where the cathedral met the earth. She passed cellar windows, barred and secure. She passed heavy oak doors to side chapels, bolted and impregnable. Then, tucked away in a small, sunken cloister garden dedicated to a long-dead bishop, she found it. A place of deep shadow, perpetually damp, where ivy grew thick and unrestrained. And set into the stone floor, almost completely obscured by the creeping vegetation, was a large, flat, wrought-iron cellar grate.

It was ancient, its surface a thick crust of rust and a century of accumulated grime. To any other observer, it would have been an immovable part of the landscape. But in the cold, clear archive of Arthur’s mind, a piece of data sparked. A structural survey from the late 1980s, commissioned for insurance purposes, had noted significant galvanic corrosion on the grate's iron hinges where they met the bronze pins of the frame, a result of a persistent leak from a downspout. The recommendation for replacement had been deemed non-urgent and subsequently lost in a round of budget cuts. The flaw was thirty years old, a forgotten vulnerability waiting for the right pressure to be applied.

She knelt, her fingers clearing away the wet leaves and damp soil from the edge of the grate. She found the lip, wedged the powerful, calloused tips of her fingers underneath, and tested the weight. It was immense, a solid slab of Victorian ironwork designed to deny access to all but the most determined. She braced her feet on the solid stone, her body coiling, and then applied a slow, steady, and utterly inhuman pressure. There was no sudden crack, no loud report. Instead, a low, groaning screech of tortured metal echoed softly in the enclosed garden as the rusted hinge pins began to bend and tear. The grate, which had not moved in a hundred years, lifted a few inches, opening a black, gaping slit into the earth below. A breath of air rose to meet her, a current from another age. It was cold, still, and utterly pure, carrying the clean, dry scent of ancient stone dust, deep earth, and the profound, undisturbed silence of the tomb. This was the place. Without a moment's hesitation, she swung her legs into the opening, lowered herself down, and let the heavy grate fall back into place with a deep, final, resonant thud that sealed her inside, plunging her into a darkness more complete and more welcome than any she had ever known.### Chapter 9

The darkness that swallowed her was not a simple absence of light; it was a physical presence, a thick, velvety medium that pressed in from all sides. The resonant thud of the grate falling into its stone frame was the last sound from the world above, a final, percussive note that was instantly absorbed by a silence so profound it seemed to have its own weight and texture. For a long moment, Eugenia did not move, allowing this absolute sensory deprivation to wash over her. It was the antithesis of the city’s constant, nervous hum, a perfect and eternal quietude that felt like coming home. The air, cool and utterly still, carried no scent of rain or exhaust or living things, only the clean, dry aroma of ancient dust and the faint, mineral tang of the bedrock itself. This was not a prison she had fallen into; it was the sanctum sanctorum she had been seeking her entire secret life.

Her first movement was one of exploration. She extended a hand, her fingers brushing against the cold, rough-hewn surface of a stone wall. She began to walk, her bare feet silent on the flagstones, her arms outstretched like a sleepwalker navigating a dream. The space was vast, the echoes of her own silent passage swallowed by the immense quiet. She could feel the architecture through the subtle shifts in air pressure, discerning the presence of massive support pillars and the high, vaulted arch of the ceiling far above her head. It was a crypt, a sub-basement of faith, forgotten by the sunlit world of prayer and hymns. This was the cathedral’s true foundation, a place built not for the living, but for the silent, patient dead.

Her questing hands found the edge of something large and rectangular, its surface smoother and colder than the surrounding walls. She traced its edges, her fingertips reading the deep, carved grooves of lettering. It was a sarcophagus. She moved along the wall and found another, and then a third. A row of stone coffins, the final resting places of bishops and deans from centuries past, men whose names were now just faint etchings in the stone. She felt no fear, no sense of desecration. Instead, a feeling of deep and quiet kinship settled over her. These were the other permanent residents, the silent keepers of the city’s foundation. She was not an intruder here; she was merely the newest tenant, the only one who still drew breath. She had found her community.

Having established the nature of her new domain, the cold, practical part of her mind, the last useful remnant of Arthur Cate, turned to logistics. A fortress was useless without the ability to project power from it. She returned to the spot directly beneath the grate, reached up, and placed her palms flat against its cold, iron underside. She pushed. The immense weight resisted for a moment, and then, with a low groan of rusted metal, it lifted a few inches, allowing a thin, grey sliver of the outside world to appear. She had an exit. The knowledge was all she required. She let the grate fall shut, plunging herself back into perfect darkness. The plan formed with immediate clarity: retrieve her essential possessions from the compromised shed and transfer them to this impregnable new home. The first and most crucial item on that list was the jar, her sacred history, her testament.

Pushing the grate open a second time felt different. The sliver of night that appeared was no longer a welcome sign of access but a jarring intrusion, an unwelcome leak of the thin, chaotic world into her perfect, silent void. When she emerged back into the cloister garden, the air felt flimsy, the sounds of the distant city—a car horn, a closing door—an irritating cacophony. The world above ground had become the alien environment, a place to be visited, transacted with, but no longer a place to be inhabited. Her perspective had undergone its final, fundamental inversion. The tomb was home; the city was the wilderness outside its walls. She moved with a new urgency, a desire to complete her task and retreat back into the sublime peace of the deep earth.

Her journey across the river was a silent, efficient transit. She arrived at the allotment, the scent of the vagrant’s fear and filth now a faint, sour memory on the air. She entered the shed for the last time. It felt fragile and temporary, a hovel made of rotting wood and decay. She gathered her few belongings: the heavy wool coat, the canvas satchel containing Arthur’s money, and, most importantly, the jar. She lifted it from its shelf, the contents sloshing with a familiar, liquid whisper. She held it not with the frenzied need of a collector, but with the solemn gravity of a curator moving a priceless and irreplaceable artifact to a more secure vault. She gave the shed one last, dismissive glance, then turned and walked away, leaving it to its inevitable collapse, a forgotten snakeskin she had long since shed.

Returning to the cathedral, she descended into the crypt with her sacred burden. The final enthronement was a solemn, silent ceremony. After a brief exploration, she had discovered a small, dry side-chamber, likely a former ossuary or a private chantry, its entrance a low, perfect archway. Within it, carved into the far wall, was a shallow niche that might once have held a reliquary or a statue of a minor saint. It was the perfect plinth. She placed the heavy pickling jar within the niche, its thick glass and pale, swirling contents looking ancient and profound in the deep gloom. It was a heart transplanted into a new body, a totem of power placed at the very centre of her new empire of silence. She stepped back, admiring her work, then retreated to the main chamber, curling up at the base of a massive stone pillar, a sentinel at rest in her own eternal fortress. The last loose thread had been woven into the tapestry. Her transformation was, at last, complete.### Chapter 9

The crypt was a realm outside of time. Down in the absolute, subterranean dark, the frantic cycles of the sunlit world ceased to have meaning. Eugenia’s existence settled into a new, profound rhythm, dictated not by the chiming of the cathedral clock far above, but by the deep, slow tides of her own ancient biology. The days were spent in a state of hibernation so complete it bordered on petrification, her body curled at the base of a great stone pillar, her breathing so shallow as to be undetectable, her consciousness submerged in a black, dreamless void. The nights were for a silent, vibrant wakefulness, her senses extending into the profound quiet, tasting the subtle shifts in air pressure, feeling the immense, silent weight of the cathedral and the city pressing down from above. She was the living heart of a dead mountain, a solitary god in a temple of her own choosing.

In these long, silent hours of wakefulness, she found a new and unexpected use for the archive of Arthur Cate’s mind. With the immediate tactical need for routes and maps rendered obsolete, she began to drift through the quieter, deeper stacks of his memory. She read the histories of the men whose stone sarcophagi were now her silent companions. She learned the names of the dour, powerful bishops, tracing the faded lineages and forgotten theological disputes that had shaped their lives and, by extension, the very stones that now gave her shelter. She explored Arthur’s academic knowledge of the cathedral’s construction, the medieval masonry techniques, the symbolism carved into the bosses of the vaulted ceiling far above her head. It was not an act of empathy, but of deep, scholarly possession. She was learning the genealogy of her own fortress, absorbing the history of the foundation upon which her new reality was built.

The sated peace, which had felt as permanent as the stone around her, began its inevitable, gentle dissolution. It was not a violent reawakening, but a slow, geological shift from within. The perfect silence of the crypt, once a source of sublime contentment, began to acquire a new quality—an emptiness, a subtle lack that her body remembered how to fill. A phantom ache began to manifest in her jaw, a memory of tension and release. Her stillness became less a state of peace and more a state of coiled potential. The sleeping leviathan was not yet hungry, but it was stirring, its immense tail beginning a slow, powerful sweep in the deep, dark waters of her being, sending the first faint ripples to the surface of her consciousness. The patient watch was nearing its end; the cycle was preparing to turn.

The decision to emerge, when it came, was as logical and un-emotive as a change in the weather. Her body knew it was time. But before she returned to the world above, she performed a small, silent ritual. She rose from her place at the pillar and walked to the small antechamber where her history was enthroned. She stood before the niche, her gaze fixed on the heavy glass jar. She did not touch it. She did not need to. She simply stood in its presence, a silent communion with the physical evidence of her own nature, reaffirming the long, bloody path that had led her to this perfect sanctuary. It was an act of grounding, a re-centering of her purpose before she exposed herself to the chaotic energies of the surface. Her moment of reflection complete, she moved to the spot beneath the grate, placed her palms against its cold, iron underside, and pushed. The low, grinding screech of the corroded hinges, a sound she was coming to know intimately, was a violent desecration of the tomb’s perfect silence, the sound of a seal being broken.

Emerging from the crypt was like being born into a world of overwhelming, painful sensation. The sliver of night that appeared as she lifted the grate was not dark, but a blinding wash of faint, ambient moonlight and the distant, diffuse glow of the city. The air that rushed in was a chaotic assault, a thick, wet soup of a thousand conflicting scents—damp earth, rotting leaves, diesel fumes, the salt tang of the river. As she pulled herself up into the cloister garden, the gentle rustle of ivy in the breeze was a deafening roar, the patter of a light rain on the flagstones a frantic, percussive clatter. She stood for a long minute, letting her senses, which had become attuned to the perfect zero of the crypt, painfully recalibrate to the frantic, noisy baseline of the living world. She was an alien standing on familiar ground, a creature of the deep brought unwillingly to the shimmering, chaotic surface.The process of recalibration was not one of panic, but of a cold and deliberate filtering. She stood immobile in the garden, a statue of dark wool, and systematically partitioned the incoming chaos. The frantic patter of the rain was separated from the distant, rhythmic hum of the city’s electrical grid. The scent of wet soil was isolated from the acrid tang of distant chimney smoke. She deconstructed the sensory cacophony into its component parts, cataloguing and dismissing each one until the overwhelming noise resolved into a manageable, if still irritating, tapestry of information. It was the work of a few minutes, but it felt like an eternity spent in a loud and brightly lit room. The sublime peace of the crypt had made the surface world feel crude, garish, and fundamentally uncivilised. The desire to finish her business and retreat back into the silent earth was a cold, hard imperative.

She moved out from the cathedral grounds, a ghost gliding through a world that was no longer its own. Her purpose was singular, her focus absolute. She was not wandering, she was scanning. The city had changed in her absence. The streets were emptier, the silence more pronounced. The fear her previous work had sown had borne fruit, creating a landscape of self-imposed curfews and heightened caution. Far from being a hindrance, Eugenia found this new reality clarifying. The background noise of casual, aimless human movement had been filtered out, leaving behind only those with a definite purpose. The remaining figures on the nocturnal landscape stood out like beacons, their isolation a stark and inviting vulnerability. The herd had thinned itself, making her selection process vastly more efficient.

Her instincts, refined by her long, quiet contemplation, drew her towards the university district. It was a place governed by its own ecosystem of late-night study sessions, part-time jobs, and the lingering threads of youthful recklessness. While the rest of the city locked its doors, here the currents of life still flowed, albeit more cautiously. She found a vantage point not on the ground, but above it. Using her intimate knowledge of the city’s architecture, gleaned from the dusty archives of Arthur’s memory, she scaled a rusted fire escape on the back of a Victorian townhouse, ascending to the rooftops. From this elevated perch, she looked down upon the streets as a hawk regards a field. She was above the lines of sight, beyond the cone of vision of the predictable ground-level patrols, a silent observer in a sky the colour of a deep bruise. The city was a grid of light and shadow, and from here, she could see all the moves on the board.

She did not have to wait long. A taxi, its yellow light a cheerful intrusion, pulled up at the end of a long, residential street lined with student flats. A young man got out, his silhouette backlit by the car’s interior light as he paid the driver. The taxi drove off, its departure leaving the young man suddenly and starkly alone. He had made a small, common calculation of thrift, having the taxi drop him at the end of the street rather than directly at his door. He pulled his collar up against the rain and began the short walk, his stride confident, his mind likely already on the warmth of his flat and the promise of sleep. He was being careful—he had taken a taxi, he was not lingering—but he had created a small, fatal gap in his security. It was in these tiny, predictable failures of discipline that Eugenia found her most fertile ground. He was a perfect subject, a creature of habit whose routine had just created a perfect and unmissable opportunity.

The hunt was an exercise in three-dimensional geometry. As the student walked along the pavement below, Eugenia moved above him, a silent, parallel shadow flowing across the slick, slate-tiled roofs. She was utterly silent, her bare feet finding purchase on the wet, uneven surfaces with an animal certainty. She was faster than he was, and she arrived at a point above his destination—a large, dark Victorian villa converted into flats—a full minute before he did. She descended to the low roof of a bay window on the ground floor, a dark, motionless gargoyle perched just above the front steps. She waited. The student approached, fumbling in his pocket for his keys, his head bowed against the rain. The jingle of metal was the final sound he would register. As he stepped onto the top step, his hand reaching for the lock, she dropped from the roof behind him. It was not a pounce; it was a silent, gravitational descent. He did not have time to turn, to cry out, to even register her presence. Her arm wrapped around his throat, a bar of cold, irresistible pressure, while her other hand covered his mouth, stifling any sound before it could be born. He was lifted from his feet and pulled backwards into the deep, absolute blackness of the shrubbery in the front garden, his keys falling from his limp hand to clatter softly, unheard, on the stone step.

In the damp, secluded privacy of a thick laurel hedge, the final transaction was completed with a cold, dispassionate efficiency. There was no struggle, only a brief, convulsive shudder that quickly subsided. The ritual of collection was performed with the swift, precise movements of a surgeon, the chosen keepsake a small, perfect memento of a hunt that had been flawless in its conception and execution. She concealed the remains with a practiced indifference, pulling the thick, leathery leaves of the laurel over the form until it was completely subsumed by the garden’s deep and untended shadows. The familiar, profound peace settled over her once more, the quiet hum of the sated dynamo replacing the sharp, demanding edge of the hunt. Her work on the surface was done.

Her return to the cathedral was a silent, purposeful retreat. She carried her prize, wrapped carefully in a cloth taken from the student’s pocket, her movements once again smooth and unhurried. The city, with its jarring noises and chaotic light, was already fading from her consciousness, a temporary workspace she was now vacating. She reached the cloister garden, lifted the heavy iron grate, and descended into the perfect, welcoming blackness of her sanctuary. The deep, resonant thud of the grate falling back into place was a sound of profound relief, the sound of a great stone door sealing out the noisy, bothersome world. Down in the eternal quiet, she made her way to the chantry, placed her new trophy in the jar with its silent brethren, and then curled up at the base of her pillar. The cycle was complete. The world was back in its proper, silent order, and she sank gratefully into the deep, dreamless sleep of the tomb.### Chapter 10

The absence of Liam Casey was not a loud event; it was a slow, dawning horror that accumulated in small, discordant details. It was his flatmate, a bleary-eyed history student named Finn, noticing that Liam’s perpetually unmade bed was, for once, pristine and untouched. It was the sight of his university bag, dropped by the sofa, exactly where he had left it the morning before. It was the faint, unanswered ringing from Finn’s phone as he called his flatmate, a sound that was eventually traced to Liam’s coat pocket, still hanging on its peg by the door. The real, chilling discovery was made by the landlord, summoned by a worried Finn. On the top step of the front porch, glinting in the weak morning light, lay a single set of keys. They rested on the stone as if placed there gently, an offering to a house that would not be entered. The scene was too quiet, too clean, too utterly devoid of the chaos and violence that should accompany a man’s abduction from his own doorstep.

This unnerving stillness was the first thing that struck Detective Inspector Róisín Gallagher when she arrived. Gallagher was a Derry woman born and bred, with a mind as sharp and unforgiving as a shard of broken glass and a weary, ingrained understanding of the city's capacity for darkness. She had seen the aftermath of bombings and paramilitary punishments, the brutal, messy evidence of human conflict. This was something else entirely. She stood on the pavement, looking at the handsome Victorian villa, its tidy garden, the quiet, residential street. It was a scene of placid domesticity, yet it radiated a palpable wrongness, a silence that felt heavier and more sinister than any scream. Her uniformed officers were at a loss, their procedural instincts useless in a crime scene that contained no crime, only a profound and inexplicable void where a person used to be.

Gallagher knelt on the top step, careful not to disturb the keys. They were a small, mundane collection: a large brass Yale key, a smaller one for a bike lock, a novelty plastic fob from a music festival. They told a small story of a normal life, a life that had, in the space between a taxi door closing and a key entering a lock, simply ceased to exist. "His flatmate says he was a big lad," her Detective Sergeant, a young, earnest man named O’Neill, muttered beside her. "Played prop for the university rugby team. Not the sort of fella you just grab." Gallagher grunted, her eyes scanning the surrounding garden. The laurel hedge was thick and deep, its dark leaves glossy with rain. No broken branches, no churned-up soil, no sign of a struggle. It was as if he had been plucked from the air by a ghost.

The press, predictably, went into a frenzy. "The Creeper Strikes Again," the headlines screamed, the name now firmly embedded in the public lexicon. The mythos of the killer escalated from a shadowy threat to a full-blown supernatural entity. People spoke in hushed tones of a *bodach*, a malevolent spirit from Gaelic folklore, a creature that haunted the dark places and spirited people away. The police issued statements urging calm and vigilance, but their words were hollow against the rising tide of primal fear. The city, which had already been on edge, now seemed to be holding its breath. The streets after dark became true ghost towns, traversed only by police cars and the few who had no other choice, their hurried footsteps echoing with a new and desperate urgency.

In her silent, subterranean kingdom, Eugenia absorbed these developments with a serene and scholarly detachment. Her forays to the surface were now rare and purposeful, brief missions to a bin behind the newsagent's to retrieve the latest chapter of the story she was writing. She would sit in the absolute darkness of the crypt, the flimsy newsprint spread before her, and read of the terror she had authored. She felt no pride, no thrill, only a deep, intellectual satisfaction at the successful manipulation of an ecosystem. The invention of "The Creeper," the speculation about ghosts and demons, was a source of profound, clinical amusement. They were creating a scapegoat, a monster of their own imagining, because the truth—that the threat was a biological imperative, as natural and unthinking as a shark in the deep—was a concept their consciousness could not accommodate. Their myth-making was the ultimate camouflage, a cloak of superstition that rendered her physical reality entirely invisible.

The quiet in the city above, however, presented a new strategic challenge. The sated peace within her was absolute, the leviathan of her hunger sleeping soundly in the deep. But she knew, with the certainty of a farmer watching the seasons, that the hunger would return. And when it did, this new environment, so sparse and devoid of easy opportunity, would require a different approach. Her methods would have to evolve. The simple hunt, the interception of a lone figure on an empty street, was becoming obsolete. The prey was learning, adapting, retreating into fortified burrows. A feeling, not of concern, but of quiet, intellectual curiosity began to form in the back of her mind. The game was changing. And as she sat in the eternal silence of her stone fortress, surrounded by the sleeping dead, Eugenia began to contemplate her next move, not for the coming weeks, but for the seasons and years ahead. The problem of a scarce food source was, after all, simply another fascinating equation to be solved.The absence of Liam Casey was not a loud event; it was a slow, dawning horror that accumulated in small, discordant details. It was his flatmate, a bleary-eyed history student named Finn, noticing that Liam’s perpetually unmade bed was, for once, pristine and untouched. It was the sight of his university bag, dropped by the sofa, exactly where he had left it the morning before. It was the faint, unanswered ringing from Finn’s phone as he called his flatmate, a sound that was eventually traced to Liam’s coat pocket, still hanging on its peg by the door. The real, chilling discovery was made by the landlord, summoned by a worried Finn. On the top step of the front porch, glinting in the weak morning light, lay a single set of keys. They rested on the stone as if placed there gently, an offering to a house that would not be entered. The scene was too quiet, too clean, too utterly devoid of the chaos and violence that should accompany a man’s abduction from his own doorstep.

This unnerving stillness was the first thing that struck Detective Inspector Róisín Gallagher when she arrived. Gallagher was a Derry woman born and bred, with a mind as sharp and unforgiving as a shard of broken glass and a weary, ingrained understanding of the city's capacity for darkness. She had seen the aftermath of bombings and paramilitary punishments, the brutal, messy evidence of human conflict. This was something else entirely. She stood on the pavement, looking at the handsome Victorian villa, its tidy garden, the quiet, residential street. It was a scene of placid domesticity, yet it radiated a palpable wrongness, a silence that felt heavier and more sinister than any scream. Her uniformed officers were at a loss, their procedural instincts useless in a crime scene that contained no crime, only a profound and inexplicable void where a person used to be.

Gallagher knelt on the top step, careful not to disturb the keys. They were a small, mundane collection: a large brass Yale key, a smaller one for a bike lock, a novelty plastic fob from a music festival. They told a small story of a normal life, a life that had, in the space between a taxi door closing and a key entering a lock, simply ceased to exist. "His flatmate says he was a big lad," her Detective Sergeant, a young, earnest man named O’Neill, muttered beside her. "Played prop for the university rugby team. Not the sort of fella you just grab." Gallagher grunted, her eyes scanning the surrounding garden. The laurel hedge was thick and deep, its dark leaves glossy with rain. No broken branches, no churned-up soil, no sign of a struggle. It was as if he had been plucked from the air by a ghost.

The press, predictably, went into a frenzy. "The Creeper Strikes Again," the headlines screamed, the name now firmly embedded in the public lexicon. The mythos of the killer escalated from a shadowy threat to a full-blown supernatural entity. People spoke in hushed tones of a *bodach*, a malevolent spirit from Gaelic folklore, a creature that haunted the dark places and spirited people away. The police issued statements urging calm and vigilance, but their words were hollow against the rising tide of primal fear. The city, which had already been on edge, now seemed to be holding its breath. The streets after dark became true ghost towns, traversed only by police cars and the few who had no other choice, their hurried footsteps echoing with a new and desperate urgency.

In her silent, subterranean kingdom, Eugenia absorbed these developments with a serene and scholarly detachment. Her forays to the surface were now rare and purposeful, brief missions to a bin behind the newsagent's to retrieve the latest chapter of the story she was writing. She would sit in the absolute darkness of the crypt, the flimsy newsprint spread before her, and read of the terror she had authored. She felt no pride, no thrill, only a deep, intellectual satisfaction at the successful manipulation of an ecosystem. The invention of "The Creeper," the speculation about ghosts and demons, was a source of profound, clinical amusement. They were creating a scapegoat, a monster of their own imagining, because the truth—that the threat was a biological imperative, as natural and unthinking as a shark in the deep—was a concept their consciousness could not accommodate. Their myth-making was the ultimate camouflage, a cloak of superstition that rendered her physical reality entirely invisible.

The incident room at the Strand Road police station had acquired the sour, sleepless smell of institutional despair. A constellation of faces—missing, presumed dead—stared out from a large corkboard, a grim echo of the map Eugenia had burned. Liam Casey’s handsome, confident grin was now pinned next to Arthur Cate’s haunted, racing grimace, and the juxtaposition was a constant, irritating puzzle that gnawed at the edges of Detective Inspector Róisín Gallagher’s focus. Her team was running on fumes and stale coffee, chasing down phantom sightings, re-interviewing terrified friends, and reviewing endless hours of CCTV footage that showed nothing but empty streets and rain. They were hunting a shadow, and the shadow was winning.

“Forensics came back on the keys,” O’Neill said, dropping a thin file onto her desk with a sigh that stirred the cold air. “Clean. Wiped down, or handled with gloves. Same as the phone from the Feeney kid’s disappearance. No prints, no DNA, no fibres. Nothing.” He ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair. “It makes no sense, ma’am. Liam Casey was a unit. Over six feet, sixteen stone of muscle. You don’t just lift a man like that off his own doorstep without a sound, without a single witness or a drop of blood. It’s physically impossible.”

“Then we’re looking at the impossible,” Gallagher replied, her voice low and flinty. She didn’t look up from the board. Her eyes were fixed on Arthur Cate. He was the anomaly, the discordant note in the funereal symphony. The others were young, vibrant, sociable. Arthur Cate had been a ghost long before he vanished, a man who seemed to have spent his life trying to take up as little space as possible. “The impossible is the only thing we have left. The Creeper, the *bodach*… the public have it right in one sense. We’re not looking for a man. We’re looking for a monster. But monsters don’t exist, O’Neill. So what does that leave us with?”

She didn’t wait for an answer. She tapped a finger on Arthur’s photograph. “This is what’s wrong. The others were taken. He vanished. His flat was untouched, but his garage was the scene of… what? A bizarre, methodical ritual. He dismantled a five-thousand-pound bicycle with surgical precision. Why? A victim doesn’t do that. A victim fights, or flees, or screams. They don’t stop to perform meticulous maintenance. We’ve been treating him as Victim Number Four. It’s a mistake. He’s not part of the sequence. He’s the key.”

The long-term problem of a scarce food source was, after all, simply another fascinating equation to be solved. In the deep, silent contemplation of her subterranean world, Eugenia began a new phase of her existence: strategic planning. The simple, opportunistic hunt was a method for a target-rich environment. In the new, barren landscape of fear she had created, a more sophisticated approach was required. A rancher does not chase down a single wild beast every time he is hungry; he cultivates a herd, manages it, and harvests it at his leisure. The city, she decided, was full of contained, manageable herds. Hospitals, residential care homes, and, most promisingly, schools. These were walled gardens, ecosystems with predictable routines, high population densities, and a constant, fresh supply of stock.

Her mind, powered by the twin engines of her own ancient predatory cunning and Arthur’s encyclopedic knowledge of the city’s infrastructure, focused on the grammar school whose vulnerability she had already identified. The forgotten Victorian culvert. It was a perfect, secret door. But access was only the first part of the equation. To hunt within a sealed system, one had to understand its internal rhythms completely. She spent hours in the perfect darkness, constructing a detailed schematic of the school in her mind, layering Arthur’s knowledge of its architectural blueprints with a predator’s tactical analysis. She plotted the location of CCTV cameras, the predictable routes of the lone nighttime security guard, the shadowed dead zones between buildings, the high-walled enclosure of the sports pitches. She was not planning a raid; she was designing a farm.

The thought process was utterly devoid of malice. It was the same cold, clear logic a civil engineer might apply to a problem of water management. The hunger, when it returned, would be a predictable hydrological event. Her task was to ensure the canals were in place to channel the flood efficiently, with minimal waste and maximum discretion. The initial phase would be purely observational. She would use the culvert to enter and exit the grounds over a period of weeks, learning the school’s nocturnal pulse until it was as familiar to her as the silence of her own crypt. She would become a ghost in their machine, a silent, unseen variable in their carefully managed world. The era of the street hunt was over. The era of infiltration had begun.

“His work records?” the head librarian repeated, blinking at Gallagher through thick spectacles. He was a small, nervous man who seemed flustered by the presence of a police detective in his quiet domain of ordered books. “Arthur’s? Good heavens, I’m not sure what you’d find. He was a cataloguer. Meticulous. Punctual. If I’m honest, Inspector, he was almost completely invisible. A very quiet, very private man. This whole business has been a terrible shock.”

“I’m sure it has,” Gallagher said, her tone leaving no room for pleasantries. “His computer, his search history, access logs for the city archives. I want to see everything he looked at for the last six months.” The librarian’s eyes widened slightly. "The city archives? That would be… voluminous. Arthur had Level Three access. He assisted researchers, city planners, historians. He could call up anything from seventeenth-century parish records to the last decade of zoning variances."

An hour later, seated at Arthur’s old terminal in a back office, Gallagher felt a familiar prickle of excitement, the feeling of a cold trail suddenly radiating a faint, inexplicable warmth. Arthur’s personal search history was a desert: weather forecasts for cyclists, bicycle maintenance forums, reviews of energy gels. But his work logs told a different story. They were a secret map of a deeply obsessive mind. He had accessed architectural blueprints for the Guildhall, St. Eugene's Cathedral, and, most frequently, St. Columb's Cathedral. He had cross-referenced them with geological surveys of the city’s bedrock and historical essays on medieval fortification. He had spent weeks immersed in the city’s forgotten underpinnings, its secret passages, its subterranean skeleton. He wasn’t just looking at maps of the streets; he was studying the city’s hidden anatomy.

"He was obsessed with finding a place to hide," O’Neill suggested, looking over her shoulder. "Maybe he knew The Creeper was after him." Gallagher shook her head, a slow, decisive motion. “No. This isn’t the research of a man running from something. This is the research of a man looking for something. A lair. A nest.” She stared at the screen, at the complex, cross-sectioned drawings of the cathedral’s deep foundations and crypts. A wild, impossible, terrifying thought began to form, a theory so outlandish she could never voice it in a briefing room. What if the predator wasn't on the streets? What if it was in the very foundations of the city? What if Arthur Cate wasn’t the key to the puzzle? What if he *was* the puzzle?

The decision was made. The period of quiet contemplation was over, and the new work was set to begin. As the last of the evening light faded from the sky, staining the clouds a deep, bruised purple, Eugenia pushed open the heavy iron grate and emerged into the cool, damp air of the cloister garden. She wore the heavy wool coat, its deep pockets empty save for the tools of her former life she had yet to discard. The canvas satchel was slung over her shoulder, also empty. Her needs for this mission were nothing more than her own senses and the silent, patient discipline she possessed in infinite measure.

She moved through the now-empty city with a silent, purposeful grace. The fear of the populace had become a convenience, clearing her path, ensuring her passage would be unobserved. She crossed the Foyle via the darkened walkway of the Craigavon Bridge, a fleeting shadow against the dark, churning water. She did not head for the main roads, but followed a series of unlit footpaths and bicycle trails—routes Arthur had known intimately—that skirted the edge of the Waterside, leading her towards the high stone walls of the grammar school.

She found the overgrown thicket of rhododendron, a place no one had a reason to disturb, and located the mouth of the culvert. It was a perfect black slit in the earth, an unblinking eye staring out from another time. She dropped to her hands and knees and entered the narrow, stone-lined throat without hesitation. The air inside was cold and stagnant, thick with the smell of damp soil and a century of stillness. It was a tight squeeze, her broad shoulders brushing against the rough-hewn stones on either side, but she moved through the confined space with a reptilian ease, a creature returning to its burrow. After fifty yards of absolute, suffocating darkness, she saw a faint, filtered light ahead. She emerged, not into the open, but into another dense thicket of overgrown laurel on the inside of the school walls. She was in. The first stage of her infiltration was complete. She rose to her full height, a dark, silent figure in the heart of the enemy camp, and began her patient, meticulous study of the new herd.
