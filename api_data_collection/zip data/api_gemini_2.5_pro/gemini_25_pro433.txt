The ghost of solder and burnt plastic clung to Dagbjort’s clothes like a second skin. It was a smell he’d known his whole life, the smell of work, of problems solved with a steady hand and a roll of electrical tape. A clean join was a thing of beauty. A small, perfect silver tear holding two worlds together. He saw the same elegance in the sweeping ironwork of the Tyne Bridge, a structure that did its job with a kind of muscular grace that most people just drove over without a second glance. Dagbjort, though, he’d look. He’d see the rivets, the latticework, the sheer, stubborn integrity of it all. He understood things that were put together properly.

That was why the art history class was such a bloody weird idea. He knew it. Gaz, his mate from the depot, knew it, and made sure to remind him every Tuesday evening. “Off to look at more pictures of lads in tights, are we, Dag?” Gaz would call out, grinning over a mug of tea thick enough to stand a spoon in. “Don’t you go getting any ideas.”

Dagbjort would just grunt and pull on a clean jumper, one that smelled of fabric softener instead of flux. It was daft, really. A sparky from Gateshead, sitting in a draughty community college classroom, listening to a man talk about the Italian Renaissance. But there was something in it that had hooked him. The first week, he’d nearly walked out. All talk of tempera and triptychs. It was a foreign language. Then the tutor, Elias, had put a slide up on the projector. Caravaggio. A dark, violent, beautiful mess of a painting. Judith beheading Holofernes.

“Look at the light,” Elias had said, his voice a low, calm current in the quiet room. “It’s not divine light. It’s not coming from a heavenly source. It’s brutal. A side light. It’s the light from a single candle or a half-open door, catching the horror in the servant’s eyes, the grim determination on Judith’s face. Caravaggio doesn’t paint gods. He paints people in a badly lit room.”

And that, that had clicked. Badly lit rooms were Dagbjort’s bread and butter. He understood light sources, the way a single bulb could change the entire mood of a space, the difference between a warm glow and a cold, clinical glare. He’d spent his life chasing away shadows, and here was a man, four hundred years dead, who had painted them as if they were the main event. For the first time, Dagbjort felt he wasn’t just looking at a picture. He was reading a wiring diagram of the soul.

So he stayed. He stayed through Giotto’s stiff saints and Botticelli’s floating goddesses, waiting for the shadows to return. And he watched Elias.

Elias was maybe ten years older, with a way of moving that seemed both deliberate and utterly unselfconscious. He’d push his dark hair from his eyes with the back of his hand, leaving a faint streak of chalk dust on his forehead. He spoke about art not as if it were a dead thing under glass, but as if it were a live, volatile substance he was handling. His passion was a current, and it energised the dusty room. Dagbjort found himself leaning forward in his plastic chair, catching every word. He started reading the books Elias recommended, squinting at the tiny print in the library, the worlds of Florence and Rome blooming in his mind against the grey backdrop of the Tyne.

Most people called him Dag. A blunt, serviceable sound like a hammer hitting a nail. Elias, from the first roll call, had said ‘Dagbjort’, the ‘bj’ a soft, curious twist in the middle, the ‘t’ at the end crisp and definite. It felt… seen. The name was his dad’s Nordic affectation, a source of lifelong, low-level embarrassment. In Elias’s mouth, it just sounded like his name.

The breakthrough, if you could call it that, came during a discussion on Vermeer. A slide of ‘The Milkmaid’ was on the wall. Elias was talking about the stillness, the quiet dignity of the domestic scene.

“It’s the light again, isn’t it,” Dagbjort heard himself say. The words were out before he’d given them permission. The half-dozen other people in the class, mostly retirees and a couple of keen-looking sixth formers, turned to look at him. He felt his neck get hot.

Elias’s face broke into a genuine smile. “Go on, Dagbjort.”

“Well. It’s specific,” Dagbjort said, stumbling a bit. “The way it’s hitting that wall, it’s diffuse. Coming through a window that’s got to be, I dunno, waxed paper or just filthy glass. It’s not direct sunlight. It’s a north-facing room, probably. The shadows are soft. And the highlights on the bread, on the jug… it’s like he’s painting the physics of it. The way light falls on different surfaces. It’s… proper.”

The room was silent. Dagbjort was sure he’d made a fool of himself, translating something beautiful into the language of a tradesman.

Then Elias slowly nodded. “The physics of it. I’ve been teaching this for twelve years, and no one has ever put it that way. That is exactly it. He’s not just painting the poetics of light, he’s documenting the science of it. Thank you. That’s a perfect observation.”

After that, something shifted. Their conversations after class grew longer. They started in the corridor, Elias packing his worn leather satchel, and would continue down the stairs and out onto the street, the sodium orange of the streetlights replacing the projector’s glow. They talked about the shimmering impressionists, whom Dagbjort liked for their hazy, unfinished quality, and the stark lines of the modernists, which he found cold. He tried to explain the satisfaction of a perfectly wired plug, the logical flow from live to neutral to earth, and Elias listened, really listened, finding analogies in the compositional balance of a Poussin landscape.

One Tuesday, the rain was coming down in solid sheets, hammering on the roof of the bus shelter where they stood. The class had been on Goya, on his Black Paintings, and the mood had been sombre.

“A pint?” Dagbjort asked, the word tasting of bravado on his tongue. “The Chillingham over the road is alright. To, you know. Get the taste of Saturn eating his son out of our mouths.”

Elias looked at him, his collar turned up against the wind, rain dripping from the ends of his hair. He looked tired, but his eyes were bright. “I’d like that very much.”

The pub was loud and warm, the air thick with the smell of beer and fried onions. It was Dagbjort’s world, not Elias’s. He felt a pang of anxiety, watching Elias navigate the throng at the bar, as if he’d brought a rare bird into a dog kennel. But Elias seemed unfazed, ordering a local ale and finding them a small table in a corner, its surface sticky from decades of spilled drinks.

“So,” Elias said, taking a sip and looking around. “This is a far cry from the Prado.”

“Bit more life in it,” Dagbjort grinned, feeling the tension ease. “And the beer’s better.”

They didn’t talk about art, not really. Dagbjort talked about growing up in Gateshead, about his first job as an apprentice, the shocks both literal and figurative. Elias talked about a childhood spent in a quiet cathedral town in the south, a life of libraries and unspoken rules. He was evasive about his family, about his life before teaching this night class, but he spoke of books and travel with a hunger that Dagbjort recognised. It was the same hunger that had made him sign up for the class in the first place. A feeling that there was more to see than what was right in front of you.

“It’s the connections,” Dagbjort tried to explain, swirling his pint. “At work, everything’s about making a connection. You get it wrong, and it either doesn’t work, or it blows up in your face. It’s all cause and effect. With this art stuff… it’s the same, isn’t it? The artist makes a choice, a colour, a line, and it has an effect on you, hundreds of years later. It’s a current that’s still running.”

Elias was watching him, his chin resting on his hand. The noise of the pub, the clatter of the fruit machine and the shouted conversations, all seemed to fade away. There was just the small circle of their table, the low light glinting on their glasses.

“That’s a beautiful way of thinking about it,” Elias said softly. “A current that’s still running.” He held Dagbjort’s gaze for a moment longer than was strictly necessary for a tutor and his student. A circuit, Dagbjort thought, was being completed. Something was flowing between them, warm and quiet and undeniable. It was terrifying. It was brilliant.

When they left, the rain had eased to a fine drizzle. The air was clean and cold. They stood awkwardly outside the pub, the moment stretching.

“Well,” Dagbjort said, his hands shoved deep in his pockets. “Bus is due.”

“Next week’s class is the Pre-Raphaelites,” Elias said. “Lots of detail. You’ll appreciate the workmanship.”

“Yeah. Looking forward to it.”

But he wasn’t thinking about Rossetti or Millais. He was thinking about the way Elias’s eyes had looked in the pub’s dim light, the way a smile had touched the corner of his mouth when Dagbjort had tried to explain his job. He was thinking that for the first time in a long time, he felt like more than just a sparky from Gateshead. He felt… connected. To something vast and complicated and full of light and shadow. He watched Elias walk away, a dark figure disappearing into the damp night, and a ridiculous, hopeful, dangerous thought flickered into life: this could be the start of something. Something real. He had no idea, of course. No idea of the catastrophic failure of judgement, the appalling aesthetic decision that was waiting for them just a few weeks down the line. For now, there was just the clean, cold air, the distant rumble of the city, and the feeling of a switch being flicked on inside him, flooding everything with a strange and brilliant light.

The following weeks were a careful dance. The pub became their regular Tuesday spot. The conversations deepened. Dagbjort learned that Elias had a small, chaotic flat in Jesmond, filled more with books than furniture, that he existed on a diet of toast and strong coffee, and that he had a mortal fear of spiders. Elias learned about Dagbjort’s quiet pride in his work, the flat he’d bought with his own savings, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of late-nineties indie music. They were mapping each other’s territories, finding common ground in the most unlikely places. The tutor-student dynamic was still there, a faint line drawn between them, but it was growing thinner, more permeable, with every shared joke and lingering glance.

One evening, Elias was describing the lengths J.M.W. Turner went to in order to capture the truth of a storm at sea, supposedly having himself tied to the mast of a ship. “Imagine that,” Elias said, his eyes wide with the story. “The sheer commitment to seeing something properly. To feeling it.”

“It’s mad,” Dagbjort said, but he understood it. He’d once spent three hours contorted in a freezing loft space just to get a single length of cable run neatly along a beam where no one would ever see it. But he’d know. The integrity of the circuit demanded it. “But I get it. You can’t do a job halfway.”

“No,” Elias agreed, his gaze fixed on Dagbjort. “You really can’t.”

And the unspoken thing between them was no longer a question of if, but when. The tension was becoming a physical presence, a hum in the air like an overloaded transformer. Dagbjort felt it every time their hands brushed as Elias passed him a book, or when they stood a little too close at the bus stop. He felt a recklessness growing in him, a desire to just reach out and bridge the final gap, to see what would happen. Blow a fuse or light up the world.

The final class of the term was on Expressionism. The colours were loud, the shapes distorted by emotion. Munch’s ‘The Scream’ filled the projector screen. Elias spoke of anxiety, of the modern world’s psychic anguish made visible. Dagbjort just saw a raw, open circuit. A soul shorting out. It made him want to wrap Elias in a blanket and make him a cup of tea.

After their pint at The Chillingham, a celebratory, end-of-term feeling in the air, Elias didn’t move to leave. He just sat there, turning his empty glass in his hands.

“There’s a small exhibition on at the Laing,” he said, not quite meeting Dagbjort’s eye. “Scottish Colourists. You’d like them. All bold choices. No messing about.”

“Yeah?” Dagbjort’s heart started a heavy, clumsy beat.

“I was going to go on Saturday. I was wondering… if you’d like to come with me.”

It wasn’t a tutor suggesting an educational trip. The pretense was gone. His tone was hesitant, hopeful. This was an invitation. A date.

“Yeah,” Dagbjort said, his voice steadier than he felt. “Yeah, I’d like that.”

“Good,” Elias breathed out, a real, relieved smile spreading across his face, transforming it. “It’s good.”

They walked to the bus stop in a comfortable silence. The term was over. The formal structure of their relationship was gone. From Saturday, they would be just two people. Two men, meeting to look at some pictures. Dagbjort felt a dizzying sense of possibility. He was an electrician from Gateshead. He fixed things. He dealt in the practical, the tangible. And he was about to go on a date with a man who could talk about the soul of a painting, who could find poetry in a streak of light. It made no sense at all. It was the most sensible thing in the world. As his bus pulled up, its brakes hissing, Elias touched his arm. A brief, warm pressure through the fabric of his jacket.

“Saturday, then,” Elias said.

“Saturday,” Dagbjort confirmed, getting on the bus and swiping his card without looking. He found a seat and watched Elias get smaller on the pavement, a solitary figure under a streetlight, before the bus turned a corner and he was gone. Dagbjort leaned his head against the vibrating window, the lights of the city smearing past. A current was running, and for the first time in his life, he wasn’t thinking about where the off-switch was. He was just happy to feel the glow.Saturday morning broke grey and indecisive over Gateshead. Dagbjort, who was usually up and out by eight for a side job or a trip to the big B&Q, found himself standing in front of his wardrobe, paralysed by choice. The problem wasn’t a lack of clothes, but a lack of clothes that seemed right for meeting a man who used words like ‘chiaroscuro’ in casual conversation. Everything he owned was practical, durable, chosen for comfort and its ability to not show oil stains. It was the uniform of his life, and for the first time, it felt inadequate. He settled on his best jeans, a dark grey Henley, and the navy jumper that didn’t smell of fabric softener, but just smelled clean. It felt more honest. He wasn’t trying to be someone he wasn’t. He was just a sparky, going to look at some paintings.

He was ten minutes early. He stood across the road from the Laing, watching the grand stone entrance as people came and went. He felt exposed, a solid, tangible object in a world of passing traffic and fleeting glances. What if this was a mistake? What if, away from the softening effect of two pints and a dim pub corner, the differences between them became a glaring, unbridgeable chasm? He saw Gaz’s grinning face in his mind, heard the inevitable slagging. Then he saw Elias, walking up towards the gallery entrance, and the anxiety dissolved, replaced by a low, pleasant hum of anticipation. Elias was wearing a long, dark green coat, a bit frayed at the cuffs, and a ridiculously bright yellow scarf was thrown around his neck. He looked like a flash of unexpected colour on a grey day. He looked exactly like himself.

“You’re early,” Elias said, a smile already in his eyes as Dagbjort crossed the road to meet him.

“Didn’t want to miss any of the… bold choices,” Dagbjort replied, the joke landing with a soft thud of relief between them. They stood there for a moment, the sounds of the city swirling around them, caught in that slightly awkward, pre-date bubble.

“Shall we?” Elias gestured towards the doors, and as they went in, his hand brushed against the small of Dagbjort’s back, a guiding, momentary touch that sent a jolt right through him. A perfectly completed circuit.

The exhibition was in a bright, high-ceilinged room. The paintings exploded off the walls, a riot of purples, oranges, and greens. It was like the volume had been turned up on reality. Dagbjort found himself drawn to a painting of a vase of flowers on a windowsill. The artist had rendered the light coming through the glass with slashes of pure white and yellow paint, so thick you could see the brushstrokes. It wasn’t a photograph of the light; it was the idea of it, the feeling of it.

“They’re not subtle, are they?” Elias said, coming to stand beside him. His voice was lower now, without the need to project to a classroom. It felt more intimate.

“No. It’s like they couldn’t get the paint on the canvas fast enough,” Dagbjort observed. “Like they were just desperate to get the feeling down before it went. It’s a bit messy. I like it.” He pointed at the window in the painting. “He’s done that with three strokes of paint. That reflection. But you know exactly what it is. It’s clever.”

“It’s confidence,” Elias murmured, looking from the painting to Dagbjort. “Believing that your version of the world is worth recording. That your choices are the right ones.”

They moved through the gallery in a slow orbit, sometimes talking, sometimes just looking, comfortable in the silence. Dagbjort found he saw things differently with Elias beside him. He wasn't just looking at pictures; he was in a conversation that spanned a century. Elias would point out how an artist was borrowing from the French, and Dagbjort would counter by noticing how the light on a painted Scottish hillside was exactly the kind of flat, silver light that came before a proper downpour on the Tyne. He felt a rightness in it, this easy exchange of knowledge. He was sharing his world, and Elias wasn’t just tolerating it, he was interested. He was adding to it. They weren’t a tutor and a student anymore. They were just two people, sharing a way of seeing.

After they had seen everything, they found a polished wooden bench in a quieter, adjoining gallery, surrounded by stern-faced Victorian portraits. The mood shifted. The art was no longer a buffer. They were just sitting together, a foot of space between them.

“So,” Dagbjort said, into the quiet. “Do you do this all the time? Wander around galleries looking intellectual?”

Elias laughed, a proper, uninhibited sound that made one of the painted Victorians look even more disapproving. “Hardly. Most of my weekend is spent marking essays from teenagers who think Picasso was a type of car. This is… a decided improvement.” He turned on the bench to face Dagbjort more directly. “Thank you for coming. I wasn’t sure you would.”

“Why not?”

“I don’t know. I’m your teacher. It’s a bit… unconventional. I worried I’d misread the signals.” Elias’s gaze was direct, his usual academic confidence replaced with a straightforward vulnerability that Dagbjort found himself wanting to protect.

“No,” Dagbjort said, his voice quiet but firm. “You read it right. The current’s running.” He used their shared language, a private joke that was suddenly serious. He saw the understanding dawn in Elias’s eyes, saw the last of the tension leave his shoulders. The space between them on the bench suddenly felt charged, full of unspoken potential. The thought of bridging it was both terrifying and utterly essential.The silence that followed Dagbjort’s words was different. It wasn’t empty; it was full, humming with the charge he’d just declared. Elias’s lips parted slightly, and in the grand, quiet gallery, surrounded by the ghosts of Victorians, Dagbjort saw his chance. He was a man who understood cause and effect, who knew that to get a result you had to complete the circuit. He leaned across the small space separating them on the bench and gently pressed his lips to Elias’s. It wasn’t a kiss of passion, not yet. It was a kiss of confirmation. It was brief, and a little clumsy, and it tasted faintly of the mint he’d nervously chewed on the way here. It was a connection made, a small, perfect silver tear holding two worlds together.

When he pulled back, Elias’s eyes were wide, a slow blush creeping up his neck, a brighter colour than anything the Scottish Colourists had managed. He looked surprised, not unpleasantly so, but as if he’d been theorising about the existence of lightning and had just been struck by a gentle, localised bolt.
“Oh,” Elias said, his voice barely a whisper.
“Yeah, oh,” Dagbjort replied, a crooked smile playing on his own lips. The most terrifying part was over. The bridge was built. Now they just had to see if it would hold their weight.
Elias let out a shaky breath that turned into a low laugh. “Right. Well. The physics of it seem to be in order.”
Dagbjort’s smile widened. “Proper.”

They left the gallery and stepped back out into the grey afternoon, but the world looked different. The muted colours of the city seemed sharper, more defined. They were a ‘we’ now, walking side-by-side, the space between them no longer a gulf but a comfortable, shared territory. The awkwardness had been replaced by a quiet, thrumming excitement. They walked without a destination, their conversation easy, touching on everything and nothing – the appalling coffee in the gallery café, the way pigeons walked with the self-importance of city councillors, the precise shade of green on Elias’s coat. It was the simple, pleasant business of learning the texture of each other’s lives.
“My flat’s not far from here,” Elias said, as they paused at a crossing in Jesmond, its tall brick houses looking solid and respectable. “If you’d like a coffee? I should warn you, my skills are limited. It’ll be instant, and probably too strong.”
“Sounds perfect,” Dagbjort said, and the simple offer felt more significant than the invitation to the gallery. This was the next step. Moving from the public to the private, from the curated world of art to the messy reality of a home.

Elias’s flat was on the top floor of a large converted townhouse. The climb up the stairs was a journey through increasing levels of quiet, the sounds of the street fading below them. Elias fumbled with his keys, a faint flush of what looked like apprehension on his face. “I should have tidied,” he muttered, as he pushed the door open. Dagbjort stepped inside and understood. The word ‘chaotic’ didn't quite do it justice. It was a testament to a life lived in books. They were everywhere. Not just on sagging shelves that lined every wall, but in precarious, gravity-defying stacks on the floor, on the arms of a worn velvet armchair, on the small kitchen counter. It wasn’t a mess, not really. It was a library that had staged a successful, if cluttered, coup against a living space. Dagbjort, a man who liked clean lines and clear access points, felt a strange sense of wonder. It was like walking into Elias’s mind.
“Wow,” he said, and it wasn’t a criticism. “You could build a fort in here.”
“It’s a work in progress,” Elias said, with a wry smile, clearing a pile of paperbacks from a small, two-seater sofa. “The Dewey Decimal System has rather collapsed under the strain.”

As Elias went to the kitchen alcove to wrestle with the kettle, Dagbjort’s eyes roamed the room. It was fascinating. A postcard of a Goya painting was tucked into the frame of a mirror. A beautiful, hand-drawn map of ancient Rome was pinned to a corkboard. It was a room full of stories. And then he saw it. In the corner, next to the armchair, stood a tall, elegant floor lamp, a mid-century modern design with a slender wooden stem and a large, drum-like shade. It was a lovely thing. Or it would have been, if it weren’t for the wiring. A new, thick, white plastic flex had been crudely joined to the lamp's original, fabric-covered cord. The connection was wrapped in a pathetic, peeling spiral of what looked like sellotape, through which the coppery glint of a badly twisted join was clearly visible. It was not a clean join. It was not a thing of beauty. It was an argument waiting to happen. It was a fire.
“Did you… did you rewire this lamp?” Dagbjort asked, his voice betraying a professional horror he couldn't suppress.
Elias turned from the kettle, two mugs in his hands. He followed Dagbjort’s gaze. “Oh, that! Yes. The old cord was frayed. I had a go myself a few weeks ago. Rather proud of it, actually. It works.”
He reached over and clicked the switch. The lamp flickered violently, buzzed like an angry wasp, and then, with a reluctant sigh, cast a warm glow over the mountain of books beside it. Dagbjort flinched.
“It works,” he repeated, deadpan. “For now.” He walked over to it, drawn by a force stronger than himself. He squatted down, peering at the joint. It was worse up close. The wires weren't even properly twisted, and there was no earth. It was a shock waiting for a victim, a house fire in larval form. This, he thought, his heart sinking with a strange, comical dread. This was the appalling aesthetic decision. This was the catastrophic failure of judgement. A man who could deconstruct the sublime geometry of a Piero della Francesca, who could articulate the soul-baring agony of a Goya, had committed this… this electrical atrocity.
“Elias,” he said, looking up from the floor, his face serious. “We need to talk.”
Elias looked utterly bewildered, the smile fading from his face. “About the lamp?”
“About the lamp,” Dagbjort confirmed gravely. “This isn’t a connection. It’s a cry for help.”Chapter 2

Elias blinked, the two mugs of coffee held in his hands suddenly seeming like props in a play where he’d forgotten his lines. A deep line of confusion formed between his brows. “A cry for help? It’s a lamp, Dagbjort, not one of Goya’s Black Paintings. It gives off light. Job done, I thought.” He set the mugs down on a teetering stack of art monographs that was serving as a coffee table, his movements uncertain.

“Job done?” Dagbjort got to his feet, a low-level, horrified energy buzzing off him. He felt like he’d just discovered a ticking bomb in a nursery. “Elias, this is an affront to physics. You’ve used sellotape. On a mains electrical connection. Sellotape. It’s not even insulating tape. It’s for wrapping presents.” He gestured at the wretched join with the reverence a priest might use for an unholy relic. “The heat from this will melt the adhesive, the tape will peel off, and those wires will be exposed. And you’ve twisted them together like you were closing a bread bag.”

He knelt again, pointing. “This is live, this is neutral. There’s no earth. This whole metal stand, this lovely bit of wood, it’s all just waiting for a loose strand of wire to touch it. And then the whole thing becomes live. You come over here in your socks, you touch it to turn it on, and you, Elias, you become the earth wire. That’s not a poetic metaphor. That’s a coroner’s report.” Dagbjort looked up at him, his face a mask of profound seriousness. “You, a man who understands the structural integrity of a cathedral, have built a deathtrap in your own living room.”

Elias stared, first at the lamp, then at Dagbjort’s intense, earnest face, and the full force of the situation finally landed. It wasn’t a tradesman’s pedantry. It was genuine, professional, full-throated alarm. A slow smile, equal parts embarrassment and something else, something warmer, spread across his face. “Good heavens. You’re actually terrified for my life.” He let out a soft laugh. “I thought the most dangerous thing in this room was a paper cut.”

“It’s not funny,” Dagbjort said, though the corner of his own mouth twitched. The absurdity of it, the sheer Elias-ness of it all, was starting to break through his panic. “Right. Unplug it. Now.” Elias dutifully followed the cord to the wall and pulled the plug. The light died, plunging the corner into a sudden, book-lined gloom. “Have you got any tools?” Dagbjort asked, already knowing the answer. “Screwdrivers? Wire strippers? A proper connector block?”

Elias made a vague gesture towards a kitchen drawer. “I think there’s a knife that’s a bit wobbly, and the corkscrew has a little blade on it?” Dagbjort just sighed and shook his head, a wave of affection so strong it almost knocked him off balance washing over him. This brilliant, hopeless man. “Stay there,” he said, a commander taking charge of a battlefield. “Don’t touch anything. Don’t even look at it too hard. I’ll be back.”

He clattered back down the four flights of stairs to the street where his van was parked. It was his work van, a rolling extension of himself, and he knew in the jumbled but organised chaos of the back, he had everything he needed. He grabbed his tool bag, the familiar weight of it in his hand a comfort. He was back on solid ground. This, he understood. He returned to the flat, slightly out of breath, to find Elias exactly where he’d left him, standing by the sofa and looking at the offending lamp with a newfound, respectful fear.

“Right then,” Dagbjort said, unzipping the bag and laying out his tools on the floor with a series of satisfyingly solid clicks and clunks. A roll of thick black insulating tape, a set of precision screwdrivers, a pair of wire strippers, and a small, pristine white box of terminal blocks. To him, they were as beautiful and fit for purpose as any artist’s brushes. He knelt down and, with a surgeon’s focus, began to operate. He snipped away the pathetic tape, his mouth set in a thin line of disapproval. He separated the poorly twisted wires and, with the strippers, expertly bared a clean, uniform length of copper on each one.

Elias pulled over the single velvet armchair and sat down to watch, the undrunk mug of coffee cupped in his hands. The room was quiet save for the snip of the cutters and the soft rasp of plastic. He was watching Dagbjort’s hands. They were not the hands of a scholar, but they were clever, confident, and steady. They moved with an economy and a purpose that Elias recognised from watching documentaries of potters or glassblowers. It was the grace of a master craftsman, a knowledge held not in the head, but in the muscles and the fingertips.

“You’re very serious about this,” Elias said into the quiet.
“It’s my job,” Dagbjort said, not looking up. He selected a small connector block and a screwdriver. “You get it wrong, things fail. People can get hurt. It’s got to be right. There’s no room for interpretation.” He carefully fed the neutral wires into one side of the block and tightened the tiny grub screw, giving the wire a gentle tug to check it was secure. He did the same for the live. The connection was clean, insulated, and mechanically sound. A small, perfect piece of order imposed on chaos.
“A current that’s still running,” Elias quoted back at him softly. “You have to make sure it runs in the right channel.”
Dagbjort finally looked up, a small, proud smile on his face. “Exactly. You’re getting it.” He wrapped the entire join neatly in black insulating tape, stretching it as he went so it formed a tight, waterproof seal. The whole operation had taken less than five minutes. He stood up, wiping his hands on his jeans. “There. Plug it in.”

Elias got up and put the plug back into the socket. He hesitated for a second, then reached for the lamp’s switch. He looked at Dagbjort, who gave him a confident nod. Elias clicked the switch. A clean, unwavering, steady light instantly filled the corner. There was no flicker, no buzz, no electrical sigh of reluctance. Just light. Pure and simple. It illuminated the spines of the books, casting a warm, safe glow over the little alcove.

“Oh,” Elias said, looking from the lamp to Dagbjort, his face lit by its glow. “It’s… better. The light seems calmer.”
“That’s because it’s not fighting for its life anymore,” Dagbjort said, packing his tools away. He felt a deep, profound satisfaction. He had come into this room, this haven of intellectualism and beauty, and he had made it safe. He had fixed something. He had brought his own kind of elegance, his own muscular grace, into Elias’s world. He zipped his tool bag shut and looked at Elias, who was still gazing at the lamp with a look of wonder.
“Your coffee’s probably cold,” Dagbjort said.
“I can make more,” Elias replied, turning to him, his eyes shining in the new, steady light. “Dagbjort. Thank you. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone do anything with such… well, with such integrity.”
The praise landed right in the centre of Dagbjort’s chest. It was better than ‘thank you’. It was ‘I see you’. ‘I understand what you value’. The last of the anxiety from the gallery, the last of the strangeness of being in this new place, it all just evaporated. He had fixed a lamp, and in doing so, had fixed something between them too. He had made a proper connection.Chapter 3

A quiet moment passed, filled only by the hum of a well-behaved lamp. The scent of hot dust and old paper asserted itself now that the acrid smell of failing electrics was gone. Elias looked at the cold mugs, then at Dagbjort, and a slow, genuine smile returned to his face, wiping away the last of the bewilderment. “Well. I can’t very well have my saviour die of thirst. The least I can do is offer you a hot, non-life-threatening cup of coffee.” He picked up the mugs, his academic’s awkwardness returning as he navigated the book-strewn path to the kitchen alcove. “And I promise to keep all adhesive tapes safely in the stationery drawer from now on.”

Dagbjort leaned against the doorframe of the kitchen, watching. It was a space barely large enough for one person, and Elias seemed to fill it with a kind of gentle, uncoordinated energy, rinsing mugs, re-filling the kettle, searching for the coffee jar which was eventually located behind a copy of ‘The Lives of the Artists’. Dagbjort felt a wave of something warm and dangerously close to tenderness. He’d spent his life surrounded by capable people, men who could strip an engine or build a wall. Elias, who could probably not be trusted with a hammer, was capable in a way that was entirely new to him. He could build worlds with words, find the emotional blueprint in a two-hundred-year-old painting. Watching him now, looking so thoroughly human and slightly flustered, Dagbjort realised he wasn’t just attracted to the mind; he was hopelessly fond of the man himself, sellotape and all.

“It’s a good lamp,” Dagbjort said, as Elias finally handed him a steaming mug. “Good wood. It deserves a proper connection.” He took a sip of the coffee. It was, as promised, strong enough to dissolve a spoon. “My dad would have loved you. He was always trying to fix things he didn’t understand. Our toaster had a vendetta against him for about five years.”

They settled on the small sofa, the space between them much smaller this time. The newly repaired lamp cast a pool of calm, unwavering light over them, a silent testament to their combined efforts. “I’m afraid I have no such excuse,” Elias confessed, staring into his mug. “I’m not a tinkerer. I take things apart with ideas, not screwdrivers. If I can’t read about it, I’m generally at a loss. My ex used to say I lived in a theoretical world.” He gave a small, wry shrug. “He wasn't wrong. He was very practical. Very… tidy. He would have thrown that lamp out.” The admission hung in the air, a small, vulnerable offering.

Dagbjort processed this new piece of information. An ex. A practical, tidy man who would have discarded something beautiful because it was broken. He thought of the Tyne Bridge, of its stubborn integrity. You didn’t throw something like that away. You respected the workmanship. You fixed the fault. “His loss, then,” Dagbjort said, the words simple and solid. “It just needed someone who knew how to fix it.” He looked from the lamp to Elias. “Some things are worth the effort.”

The room was silent again, but it was a silence that held a conversation all of its own. Elias turned his head, his dark eyes searching Dagbjort’s face. The light caught the stray streak of chalk dust still on his forehead from a class days ago. In this quiet, book-filled room, under the steady glow of the lamp he had made safe, Dagbjort felt the last of his own defences crumble. The feeling of being an outsider, a sparky in a world of art and ideas, it was gone. He was just a man, sitting with another man, in a space that was beginning to feel like a sanctuary.

This time, when the gap between them closed, it was Elias who moved. He set his mug down on the floor with a soft clink and leaned across the worn velvet of the sofa. He framed Dagbjort’s jaw with one hand, his fingers cool against Dagbjort’s skin, his thumb stroking softly. The kiss was nothing like the tentative confirmation in the gallery. This was deliberate, and deep, and full of a quiet, wondering gratitude. It was a question and an answer all at once. Dagbjort’s own hand came up to rest on Elias’s arm, feeling the frantic pulse at his wrist. The world outside, the grey Gateshead sky, the rumble of traffic, the entire concept of Tuesday nights and art history classes, all of it fell away. There was only the warmth of the lamplight, the taste of strong coffee, and the astonishing, undeniable rightness of this connection.

When they finally broke apart, they were both breathless. Elias rested his forehead against Dagbjort’s, his eyes closed. “A current that’s still running,” he whispered, the phrase now their own private language, a statement of fact. Dagbjort let out a shaky laugh, his heart beating a heavy, joyful rhythm against his ribs. The day had unfolded in ways he could never have predicted. He’d gone from wardrobe paralysis to a lecture on Scottish art, to a first kiss, to emergency electrical surgery, to this. This feeling of being utterly, completely seen.

He looked around the room again. The chaotic stacks of books no longer looked like a mess. They looked like a life. A passionate, curious, slightly uncoordinated life. It was a room where a man who spoke five languages could live in mortal fear of a spider, where the sublime and the ridiculous sat side-by-side on a dusty shelf. And in the corner, a beautiful old lamp shone with a clean, steady light, a silent guardian over it all. Dagbjort knew, with the same certainty he felt when he closed a perfect circuit, that he didn’t want to leave. He wanted to stay right here, in the warm, cluttered, brilliant chaos of it all.They didn't leave the flat that night. The cold coffee was abandoned, the world outside the tall sash windows was forgotten, and they stayed within the warm, steady glow of the repaired lamp. They talked for hours, sprawled on the small sofa, their legs tangled together in a way that was both new and felt entirely natural. Dagbjort spoke of the satisfying logic of a fuse board, the simple rightness of a well-laid cable run, and Elias listened as if he were hearing an epic poem. In return, Elias unwound the stories of his own life; a quiet, lonely scholarship boy who found his real family in the echoing halls of libraries and galleries, a man who had loved and lost and retreated into the safety of his books. They mapped the quiet corners of each other's histories, and with every shared story, the connection between them solidified, the wiring made sound.

Dagbjort woke first. A pale, watery Sunday morning light was filtering through the dusty windowpane, turning the air motey and grey. For a moment, he was disoriented. The ceiling was too high, the air smelled of paper and old textiles instead of the faint, clean scent of his own flat. Then it came back to him in a warm rush: the gallery, the lamp, the kiss, Elias. He turned his head slowly on the pillow. Elias was still fast asleep, curled on his side, one arm thrown over a copy of Vasari’s ‘Lives of the Artists’ that had served as a makeshift bedside table. His dark hair was a mess, falling across his forehead, and his face, stripped of its usual articulate animation, looked younger, more vulnerable. The fortress of books around them seemed like a dragon’s hoard, and here, in the middle of it all, was the sleeping dragon himself. A feeling of profound, unbidden tenderness rose in Dagbjort’s chest. It was a quiet, powerful thing, like the low hum of a transformer doing its job perfectly.

Carefully, so as not to wake him, Dagbjort slipped out of bed. The floorboards were cool under his bare feet. He pulled on his jeans and Henley from the night before and padded into the main room. In the daylight, the chaos was even more magnificent. It was a beautiful, intellectual shipwreck, and he felt a strange urge to tidy it. Not to change it, but to shore it up, to make it safer. He started with the kitchen. He found the two abandoned coffee mugs, rinsed them under the tap, and began a quiet, systematic search for tea. It was an archaeological expedition. He navigated around a leaning tower of cookbooks, peered into a cupboard that seemed to contain only chickpeas and a single, forlorn jar of olives, and finally located a box of Yorkshire Tea behind a dense volume on Flemish portraiture. He filled the kettle, the sound of the running water unnaturally loud in the silent flat, and set about the task of making a proper brew. It was a simple, grounding act. He was a man in a kitchen, making tea. It was the most normal thing in the world, and yet it felt revolutionary.

“You’re a morning person. I should have known.” Elias’s voice, thick with sleep, came from the doorway. He was leaning against the frame, wrapped in a dark blue dressing gown, looking rumpled and soft and utterly approachable. He watched as Dagbjort expertly poured the boiling water over the bags. “You even make tea with a kind of… decisive competence. It’s unnerving.” A slow smile spread across his face, a real, unguarded morning smile. “Good morning.”

“Morning,” Dagbjort replied, his own lips curving in response. “Thought you might need a decent cuppa to get you going. Found the milk. It was a close call, but it’s still good.” He passed a mug to Elias, their fingers brushing. The small shock of the touch was still there, a pleasant jolt. Elias took a sip, his eyes closing in appreciation. “Oh, that’s good. That’s much better than my usual sludgy coffee.” He opened his eyes and looked at Dagbjort over the rim of the mug. The academic, the tutor, was gone. In his place was just a man, in his own home, with someone he’d woken up next to for the first time. “I’m not usually… I don’t normally have people… stay.” The confession was quiet, a little shy. “I’m glad you did.”

They sat together on the sofa again, the Sunday morning silence of Jesmond settling around them. The conversation was easier now, woven with the comfortable threads of domesticity. They talked about their plans for the day. Elias had a pile of first-year essays to mark, a task he spoke of with the weary dread of a man condemned. Dagbjort had promised to look at a faulty security light for his neighbour. The mundane reality of their separate lives. But the thought of leaving felt wrong, like cutting a wire that was meant to be connected.

“This is nice,” Dagbjort said, gesturing vaguely at the room, at the mugs, at the quiet space between them. “The quiet.”

“It’s usually just quiet,” Elias replied. “Nice is a new addition.” He paused, then seemed to gather himself. “About what I said last night… about my ex. The tidy one.” Dagbjort braced himself slightly, but Elias just shrugged. “He thought all this,” he waved a hand at his book-strewn life, “was something to be managed. Cured, eventually. He wanted to put up minimalist shelves.” Elias said the words ‘minimalist shelves’ as if they were a terminal diagnosis. “You came in and you didn’t try to change it. You just saw the one broken thing and made it work. You made it better.”

Dagbjort took that in. He thought of the satisfaction of the repaired lamp, the simple joy of imposing function and safety onto a faulty system. He hadn't seen a mess to be cured; he'd seen a home that needed one small, crucial thing fixed. It was the most natural response in the world to him. “It’s a good home,” he said simply. “Just had a dodgy bit of wiring.”

Later, when the time came for Dagbjort to leave, the parting felt both momentous and utterly simple. He gathered his jacket and his tool bag, now a strange, talismanic object from their first date. Elias walked him to the door at the top of the long staircase. The air in the stairwell was cool, smelling of polish and dust.

“So,” Dagbjort said, turning at the door. “That security light won’t take all day.” The unasked question hung in the air between them.

Elias’s face lit up. “I have to get through these essays. They’re on the artistic representation of power. It’s profoundly depressing. I’ll be in desperate need of a pint and a conversation with someone who doesn’t think Banksy invented art.”

“The Chillingham, say, seven?” Dagbjort suggested, the familiar plan a comforting anchor.

“It’s a date,” Elias said, and this time, there was no hesitation, no academic veil. He leaned in and kissed Dagbjort, a proper, lingering kiss that tasted of tea and the promise of another meeting. It was a kiss that said ‘this is real’. “Drive safe,” he murmured against his lips.

As Dagbjort walked down the four flights of stairs and out into the bright, cool air of the street, he felt fundamentally altered. The city looked the same, the cars still rushed past, the grey sky was still resolutely Northern. But his own place in it had shifted. He was no longer just an observer, looking at the world and seeing how it was put together. He was part of something new now, something he and Elias were building together. He unlocked his van, the familiar click of the central locking a sound from his old life. He tossed his tool bag onto the passenger seat and got in. He started the engine, the low thrum of the diesel a comforting counterpoint to the high-voltage hum in his own veins. A current was running, strong and steady. And for the first time, he felt like he was not just the electrician, but part of the circuit itself, connected and lit up from the inside. He had a security light to fix, and then he had a date. It was, he thought with a slow-dawning grin, a bloody weird and perfect Sunday.Chapter 4

The security light belonged to Mrs. Henderson from number 42, a woman whose net curtains twitched with the precision of a seismograph monitoring the street’s every tremor. The fault was simple, a corroded connection in the junction box, a problem born of three decades of damp Tyneside winters. Dagbjort fixed it in under twenty minutes, his hands moving with the swift, unthinking competence that came from thousands of similar jobs. As he tightened the final screw on the weatherproof casing, he felt the familiar, quiet hum of satisfaction. A problem identified, a solution applied, order restored. It was the rhythm of his life. Yet, as he coiled his extension lead, the rhythm felt different today. It felt like a baseline playing under a completely new melody.

His own flat, when he got back to it, was an oasis of clean surfaces and right angles. It was the polar opposite of Elias’s book-choked den. Here, every object had a place. His tools were hung on a pegboard in the spare room, his collection of CDs was alphabetised, and the mugs in his kitchen were stacked by size. It was a space designed for efficiency and calm, a fortress against the messiness of the world. He’d always been proud of it, of the order he’d built for himself. But now, standing in the middle of his quiet, tidy living room, he saw it through different eyes. It looked… empty. He found himself wondering where Elias would put a book down. The answer was nowhere. There were no inviting stacks, no surfaces already cluttered with life. The thought was strangely unsettling.

He showered and stood in front of his wardrobe again, but today’s paralysis was gone. The choice felt simpler. He was no longer trying to guess what a man like Elias would want to see. He was just choosing what to wear to see Elias. He picked a dark green jumper, remembering the colour of Elias’s coat at the gallery, and a pair of worn-in jeans. As he pulled the jumper on, he caught his reflection in the wardrobe mirror. He saw a sparky from Gateshead, the faint smell of WD-40 still clinging to his hands from the job. But he also saw the man who had woken up that morning next to a history professor, the man who had been kissed with a startling tenderness at the top of a long flight of stairs. The two images were starting to merge into one person, and he was surprised to find he liked the look of him.

The Chillingham was loud and steamy, smelling of Sunday roasts and stale beer. It was a completely different atmosphere from the tentative post-class Tuesdays. Dagbjort spotted Elias immediately, tucked into their usual corner booth. He wasn’t nursing a pint and waiting; he was reading a slim paperback, completely absorbed, a faint frown of concentration on his face. He hadn’t seen Dagbjort yet, and for a moment, Dagbjort just watched him. He watched the way his thumb rested on the edge of a page, the way his hair fell across his brow. The feeling from that morning, that profound, protective tenderness, returned with a surprising force. He felt a ridiculous urge to go and slay whatever intellectual dragon Elias was wrestling with in those pages.

“That looks serious,” Dagbjort said, sliding into the booth opposite him. Elias looked up, and the frown was instantly replaced by that transformative smile, the one that made Dagbjort’s insides feel like a freshly wired plug, sparking into life. “Dagbjort. You’re here.” He closed the book, marking his page with a beer mat. “It’s an essay on the semiotics of advertising. Utter nonsense. I was hoping you’d rescue me.” He looked at Dagbjort’s jumper. “Green. A good choice. Very pastoral.” Dagbjort just grinned. “I was going for ‘less likely to show a tea stain’, but I’ll take pastoral.” He went to the bar, the familiar routine feeling like a homecoming. He returned with two pints of the local ale, setting them down on the sticky table. This was their ritual. This was their place.

“So, were the essays as bad as you feared?” Dagbjort asked, taking a long drink. “Worse,” Elias said with theatrical gloom. “One of them tried to argue that the power dynamic in ‘The Godfather’ could be best understood through the use of high-angle and low-angle shots, which is fine, except he seemed to think Michael Corleone was played by Al Pacino’s much shorter, evil twin, ‘Mick’.” Dagbjort snorted with laughter, a spray of beer escaping his lips. “You’re kidding me.” Elias’s eyes crinkled at the corners. “I wish I were. I recommended he stick to sociology. How was your security light?” Dagbjort told him about the corroded junction box and Mrs. Henderson’s running commentary on the neighbour’s new conservatory. It was simple, mundane talk, the bedrock of getting to know someone, and it felt more intimate than any conversation they’d had about art.

The pub throbbed around them, but their corner booth felt like a bubble. The self-consciousness that Dagbjort had anticipated, the fear of what Gaz or anyone else might say, simply didn’t materialise. He was too absorbed. He found himself watching Elias’s hands as he talked, gesturing to emphasise a point about Renaissance perspective. He thought of those same hands fumbling with sellotape, and then, later, touching his face with such surprising certainty. The contrast was everything. After a while, the conversation lulled, and Elias looked down into his pint, a thoughtful expression on his face. “I have a confession,” he said, his voice a little lower. “I almost cancelled my class, that first week.” Dagbjort’s eyebrows shot up. “Why?” Elias shrugged, a little embarrassed. “Enrolment was low. I felt a bit… pointless. Another term talking about things I love to a room of mostly empty chairs. I was tired of it. I thought, what’s the use?” He looked up and met Dagbjort’s gaze. “And then you stayed. And you asked questions no one had ever asked. You made me see it all differently. The physics of it.”

Dagbjort didn’t know what to say. He felt a warmth spread through his chest that had nothing to do with the ale. “I nearly walked out, you know,” he admitted. “All that talk of triptychs. Sounded like a brand of indigestion tablet.” Elias laughed, a real, unburdened sound that cut through the pub’s noise. “Well, I’m glad we both persevered.” He reached across the table and, with a startling lack of hesitation, covered Dagbjort’s hand with his own. It was a simple, public declaration. A connection made, right there in the middle of The Chillingham Arms. Dagbjort felt the warmth of his skin, the light pressure of his fingers. He looked down at their joined hands on the dark wood of the table, then back up at Elias’s smiling, hopeful face. He didn’t pull away. He just turned his hand over and laced their fingers together. The circuit was complete. Anyone could see it. He found he didn’t give a damn.

When they’d finished their second pint and the pub was starting to thin out, the inevitable question of ‘what next?’ hung in the air. Going their separate ways felt like an impossibility, a faulty design. “I’m not sure I can face going back to that flat,” Elias said, a mock-sombre tone in his voice. “All those essays judging me. The ghost of ‘Mick’ Corleone lurking in the shadows.” Dagbjort felt a surge of bravery. It was time to show his own hand, to reveal his own world. “My place is on the way to the bus stop,” he said, his voice steady. “It’s… tidy. Probably a bit boring after your place. But the coffee’s decent and nothing’s a fire hazard.” He was offering an invitation not just into his home, but into his life. The ordered, quiet, practical life that was so different from Elias’s. He waited for the answer, his heart beating a little faster. Elias’s fingers tightened around his. “I’d like that very much, Dagbjort,” he said softly. “Show me your world.”The walk from the pub was a short one, a ten-minute journey through quiet, terraced streets where the Sunday night stillness was broken only by the blue flicker of televisions behind drawn curtains. Dagbjort was acutely aware of the keys in his pocket, their weight a reminder of the destination. He felt a nervous tremor he hadn’t experienced since his apprenticeship interview. His flat was his sanctuary, a space he had meticulously crafted to be the antidote to the grime and chaos of his working day. It was a reflection of the part of him that craved order, that saw beauty in a clean join and a level surface. Now, walking beside a man whose own home was a beautiful, literary explosion, he worried his sanctuary would look like a sterile holding cell, a place devoid of passion or life.

“This is me,” he said, stopping in front of a modest, modern block of flats. It was brick and glass, tidy and unremarkable, worlds away from the crumbling Victorian grandeur of Elias’s building in Jesmond. The communal hallway was brightly lit, smelling faintly of bleach and carpet cleaner. As they took the lift to the third floor, the smooth, silent ascent felt like a journey into a different kind of territory. At his own front door, Dagbjort found his hand was not quite steady as he slid the key into the lock. He was about to expose the very blueprint of his soul, and he had no idea if the man beside him would be able to read the schematic. He pushed the door open and flicked a switch. The hallway flooded with clean, neutral light from a simple, flush-mounted ceiling fixture.

He stepped back to let Elias enter. The flat was exactly as he’d left it: immaculate. From the hallway, the living room was visible, a study in calm, muted tones of grey and navy. A dark grey sofa with two perfectly placed cushions sat opposite a television, its wires hidden from sight, routed invisibly through the wall. On a simple oak coffee table, a small stack of music magazines was aligned with the edge, next to two remote controls sitting side-by-side like resting soldiers. There were no piles of anything. There were no precarious towers of books. The only art on the wall was a large, black-and-white photograph of the Tyne Bridge, a starkly beautiful shot focusing on the latticework and the dark, formidable curve of the iron.

“So, yeah,” Dagbjort said, the words sounding clumsy in the quiet space. He gestured vaguely, a half-shrug of apology. “Told you it was tidy. A bit… bare, maybe.” He watched Elias’s face for any flicker of disappointment or, worse, boredom. Elias didn’t answer immediately. He moved slowly into the room, his long coat still on, his gaze sweeping across the space not with a cursory glance, but with a deep, analytical look. It was the same look he’d had in the gallery, the look of someone reading a composition. He walked over to the window, which overlooked the distant, glittering lights of the city centre, then turned back to survey the room again.

“It’s not bare, Dagbjort,” Elias said finally, his voice soft but certain. He turned to face him, his eyes alight with genuine discovery. “It’s serene. It’s like a piece of minimalist sculpture. There’s no wasted line. Everything has a purpose. My flat… my flat is a Turner seascape, all chaotic energy and emotion. This,” he gestured to the clean lines of the room, “this is a Mondrian. It’s a composition of pure form and balance. It has its own kind of beauty. A quiet, confident one.” He walked over to the photograph of the bridge. “And this. Of course. The sheer, stubborn integrity of it all.” He looked from the picture to Dagbjort, and his smile was full of understanding. “It’s not boring, Dagbjort. It’s you. It’s put together properly.”

A feeling of profound relief washed over Dagbjort, so potent it almost made him dizzy. Elias hadn’t just been polite; he had understood. He had translated Dagbjort’s world into his own language and found it beautiful. A dam of tension broke inside him, and he let out a breath he hadn’t realised he was holding. “Coffee?” he asked, his voice sounding more like his own again. “I can guarantee the wiring on the kettle is up to code.” In the kitchen, the sense of order was even more pronounced. The stainless-steel surfaces were spotless, the cupboard doors were all perfectly aligned, and a magnetic strip on the wall held a set of kitchen knives in a neat, descending row. Elias leaned against the doorframe, watching as Dagbjort moved with an easy, efficient grace, getting mugs from the cupboard, milk from the fridge, coffee from a sealed caddy. The entire process was a smooth, silent ballet of domestic competence.

They sat on the firm, comfortable sofa, the warmth of the mugs in their hands. The flat was quiet, the only sound the low, almost imperceptible hum of the refrigerator. There were no flickering lights, no precarious stacks of books threatening to collapse, no sense of encroaching chaos. There was just the calm, the quiet, and the two of them. Dagbjort looked at Elias, who seemed utterly at ease, as if the quiet order of the room was a balm. He had brought the man from the beautiful shipwreck of a flat into his own clean, well-lit harbour, and the man had not felt trapped. He had felt safe. “This is good,” Elias said, taking a sip of coffee. “The quiet. The feeling that everything is exactly where it’s meant to be.” He set his mug down on a coaster Dagbjort had placed on the table. He reached out, not for a handshake across a pub table, but just to rest his hand on Dagbjort’s knee, a simple, solid point of contact. It was an anchor. “Thank you for showing me,” he said. “For showing me your world.” Dagbjort looked at the hand on his knee, then at Elias’s face, illuminated by the clean, unwavering light of a perfectly installed ceiling lamp. The two worlds hadn’t collided. They had connected. And in the calm, ordered quiet of his living room, Dagbjort knew with absolute certainty that this connection was the most beautiful, elegant, and properly constructed thing he had ever had a hand in building.Chapter 5

The weeks that followed settled into a rhythm, a comfortable alternating current between their two worlds. Tuesdays were still for art, but the class was just a prelude to the pub, and the pub was a prelude to a slow walk back to one of their flats. They spent a Saturday morning at the Grainger Market, where Elias marvelled at the architectural ironwork of the roof while Dagbjort methodically sourced the best cut of bacon. They spent a rainy Sunday afternoon in Elias’s flat, Dagbjort patiently showing Elias how to properly wire a plug for a new kettle, while Elias read him poetry by Louis MacNeice. They were learning the cadence of each other’s lives, finding the shared spaces between the quiet order of Dagbjort’s world and the vibrant chaos of Elias’s. Dagbjort found himself looking at the elegant curve of a copper pipe and thinking of the lines in a Renaissance drawing. Elias, in turn, started noticing the city’s infrastructure, pointing out the elegant geometry of a substation or the satisfying symmetry of a row of satellite dishes.

The Chillingham had become their territory. They had their booth, the one in the corner, and the bar staff had started pouring their usual pints the moment they walked in. It was here, one Tuesday evening, that Dagbjort’s two worlds were destined for a head-on collision. They were deep in a discussion about the new term’s syllabus – Elias wanted to include a section on industrial art and design, an idea sparked entirely by Dagbjort – when the pub door swung open, bringing a gust of cold air and the loud, familiar voice of Gaz. Dagbjort’s stomach instantly tightened into a cold knot.

“Well, well, look what the cat dragged in!” Gaz boomed, spotting Dagbjort in the corner. He started weaving his way through the tables, a grin already plastered across his face. Dagbjort felt a primitive urge to slide under the table. He’d managed, so far, to keep this part of his life separate. Elias was a precious, carefully wired circuit, and Gaz was a power surge in steel-toed boots. He braced himself for impact.

“Alright, Dag?” Gaz said, clapping a heavy hand on his shoulder. His eyes flickered to Elias, a look of blatant, unsubtle curiosity on his face. “Didn’t know you were bringing your tutor out for a pint. Getting extra credit, are we?” The jibe was predictable, but it landed with a thud in the warm bubble of their booth. Dagbjort felt his neck get hot. “Gaz, this is Elias. Elias, my mate from work, Gaz.” The introduction felt like trying to connect a USB cable to a gas pipe.

“Pleasure to meet you,” Elias said, his voice calm and even. He extended a hand across the table. Gaz looked at it for a second, as if it might be a trick, before shaking it briefly. “Yeah, you too,” he grunted. He pulled up a spare chair, uninvited, and sat down backwards, his arms resting on the chair’s back. He fixed Elias with a look that was part-interrogation, part-amusement. “So. You’re the one teaching our Dag all about lads in tights, then.”

“Among other things,” Elias replied smoothly, taking a sip of his ale. He didn’t seem flustered, merely observant, as if Gaz were a particularly interesting gargoyle he’d just discovered on a cathedral. “We’ve moved on to the Expressionists. A lot less tights, a lot more existential dread. Probably not your cup of tea.”

“You can say that again,” Gaz scoffed. “I don’t get it. What’s the point in looking at a picture of a bloke screaming? I can see that on a Saturday when Newcastle concedes a last-minute equaliser.” Dagbjort winced, but Elias just smiled faintly.

“That’s a fair point,” Elias said, much to Dagbjort’s surprise. “But it’s about how he’s screaming. The artist, Munch, he uses colour and line to show you what the scream feels like, not just what it looks like. It’s the difference between a reporter describing a fire, and someone who was actually in the building. It’s about the skill of it.” He leaned forward slightly. “Dagbjort was explaining it to me last week. It’s like the difference between a messy bit of wiring that just about works, and a perfect, clean circuit board. One is just functional. The other has an elegance to it. An integrity. You’re a tradesman, you understand that, don’t you? The satisfaction of a job done properly, with real skill.”

Gaz was momentarily silenced. He stared at Elias, his usual armour of mockery rendered useless. Elias hadn’t been condescending. He hadn’t tried to lecture. He had taken Gaz’s world, the world of skilled manual work that Gaz was so proud of, and held it up as something analogous to his own. He had paid him a compliment, wrapped in the language of art history. Gaz blinked, his brain visibly trying to process this unexpected move. “Well… yeah,” he mumbled, looking from Elias to Dagbjort and back again. “A good join’s a good join. Suppose.”

The tension in the booth didn't vanish, but it transformed. The aggressive edge was gone, replaced by a baffled sort of truce. Gaz, finding his usual lines of attack neutralised, floundered for a moment. He asked a few perfunctory questions about the depot, downed his pint in two long swallows, and then stood up, scraping his chair back. “Right. Well. I’ll leave you two to your… existential dread, then,” he said. It was still a jibe, but the malice was gone. It was just habit. He looked at Dagbjort. “See you tomorrow, mate.” Then he nodded, a short, almost respectful nod, in Elias’s direction. “Alright.” And then he was gone, disappearing back into the noise of the pub.

A long silence descended on the booth. Dagbjort stared at the condensation ring Gaz’s pint glass had left on the table. He felt drained, as if he’d just spent ten minutes trying to disarm a bomb. “I am so sorry,” he said, finally looking up at Elias. “He’s… he’s a good bloke, really. He’s just got the subtlety of a lump hammer.”

Elias was watching him, a gentle, amused expression on his face. He reached across the table and placed his hand over Dagbjort’s. “Don’t be sorry. He’s your friend. And I think ‘lump hammer’ is the perfect description. A solid, functional, if occasionally destructive, tool.” He smiled. “Besides, I liked him. He cares about you. He was testing me, making sure your new hobby wasn’t going to get you hurt.” Dagbjort looked at him, astonished. Elias had seen straight through the crass jokes to the protective instinct underneath, a piece of wiring Dagbjort himself had often overlooked.

“You handled that… brilliantly,” Dagbjort said, a new kind of admiration dawning. “You disarmed him. It was like watching a bomb disposal expert.” Elias’s smile widened, and he gave Dagbjort’s hand a gentle squeeze. “I just translated. You taught me how. Some things are worth the effort to understand properly.” In that moment, Dagbjort realised his fear had been misplaced. He hadn't needed to protect Elias from his world. Elias was perfectly capable of navigating it himself, with his own set of tools. The circuit he’d been so worried about protecting wasn’t fragile at all. It had just been subjected to a massive, unexpected power surge, and it hadn’t just held. It had shone.The encounter with Gaz, far from being the catastrophic failure Dagbjort had feared, acted like a flux core, melting away the final impurities and leaving a stronger, cleaner bond between them. The awkwardness was gone, replaced by an easy, unspoken confidence. They were a fact, a ‘we’, and the acknowledgement of it, even by a baffled Gaz, had somehow made it more real. Their two separate worlds were no longer just connected; they were beginning to overlap, creating a new territory that belonged exclusively to them. It was a space built of art history and wiring diagrams, of quiet, ordered flats and chaotic, book-filled dens, a place where a discussion about Caravaggio’s use of shadow could segue seamlessly into a debate about the best way to bleed a radiator.

One Friday afternoon, Dagbjort arrived at Elias’s flat to find him not marking essays, but sitting on the floor surrounded by OS maps and travel guides, a look of intense concentration on his face that Dagbjort usually associated with the Goya Black Paintings. The repaired lamp cast a warm circle of light on the floor around him, illuminating a large, glossy photograph of a castle perched dramatically on a cliff above a windswept beach. The sheer, stubborn integrity of the structure was breathtaking. It looked like it had grown out of the rock itself. Elias looked up as Dagbjort entered, his eyes bright with an idea. He tapped the photograph with his finger. “Bamburgh Castle. The ancient seat of the kings of Northumbria. Turner painted it, you know. He captured the storm and the light. I was thinking… the class is over. My duties as your tutor are officially at an end. It might be time for a field trip, purely for pleasure this time.”

The suggestion was a door opening onto a new landscape. A weekend away. The idea was both thrilling and terrifyingly domestic. It was a clear statement of intent, a step beyond their established Tuesday and Sunday routine. A few weeks ago, Dagbjort would have been floored by the prospect, crippled by a hundred anxieties about what to pack and what to say. Now, looking at Elias’s hopeful face, at the map spread out like a promise on the floor, the only possible answer was the simplest one. He grinned, dropping his bag by the door. “Alright then. But I’m driving. And I’m in charge of the flask.” The ease with which he said it, the simple rightness of it, told him everything he needed to know about how far they had come.

The journey north the following Saturday was made in Dagbjort’s van. It was a machine built for work, not for romantic getaways. The passenger footwell was home to a stray roll of electrical tape and a user manual for a fuse board, and the air held the faint, metallic scent of Dagbjort’s trade, layered over the comforting aroma of strong tea from the flask he had wedged into the cup holder. Elias, folded into the passenger seat, seemed to find the whole experience delightful. He ran a hand over the scuffed dashboard and looked at Dagbjort, who was navigating the A1 with a relaxed, competent focus. This van, this solid, unpretentious, endlessly practical vehicle, was as much a part of Dagbjort as his tidy flat, and being in it felt like another step into his world. They drove with the radio playing quietly, a comfortable silence stretching between them as the dense suburbs of Tyneside gave way to the rolling green hills of Northumberland.

They spent the afternoon at the castle, a cold wind whipping in from the North Sea, tasting of salt and distance. It was even more immense and powerful up close. Dagbjort was in his element, his gaze drawn to the colossal scale of the stonework, the genius of the defensive architecture. He pointed out the interlocking blocks of the gatehouse, explaining the sheer physics of the load-bearing arches, the immense effort required to build something so enduring. Elias, his collar turned up against the wind, his hair a windswept mess, listened with rapt attention before pointing to the same stones and telling Dagbjort of the Saxon kings and Viking raids, of the stories and bloodshed those walls had witnessed. They were a perfect, complementary pair, one reading the structure, the other the history, translating the same magnificent object into two different languages until they had created a single, richer understanding between them.

Later, they walked on the vast, empty beach below, their footprints quickly erased by the wind. The sky was a huge, dramatic canvas of bruised purples and greys, and the sea was a relentless, churning expanse of white-flecked steel. With the castle looming behind them and the immense, open space before them, Dagbjort felt the last of his carefully constructed internal walls finally crumble. He stopped walking and turned to face Elias, the wind snatching at his words. “This is… this is the best day,” he said, the simple statement feeling inadequate to hold the scale of his happiness. Elias’s face, reddened by the cold, broke into a smile. He stepped closer, into Dagbjort’s space, his presence a warm shield against the wind. “It is, isn’t it?” he said, his voice full of a quiet, wondering joy. “It feels… real.” He reached out and took Dagbjort’s hand, his fingers cold but his grip firm, lacing them together as they stood looking out at the endless horizon.

That evening, in a small, cozy pub in a nearby village, they sat by a crackling fire, the warmth sinking into their bones. They were tired, wind-whipped, and utterly content. The pub was filled with the low murmur of conversation and the clink of glasses, a comforting, anonymous sound. They didn’t talk about art or wiring. They talked about the stunning view from the castle ramparts, the ferocity of the wind on the beach, the appalling quality of the tea at the castle café. It was the easy, unremarkable conversation of a couple who had spent a good day together, and it felt more profound than any of their earlier, more searching discussions. Looking at Elias, his face illuminated by the firelight, his eyes soft with contentment, Dagbjort felt a sense of peace so deep it was almost unnerving. He had spent his life creating order, connecting wires to bring light to dark rooms. Now, he realised that the most important connection he had ever made was this one, a circuit completed not with copper and plastic, but with quiet conversation, shared laughter, and a drive up the coast in a work van. This feeling, right here, was home. It wasn't a place; it was a person. And the light it gave off was brilliant.The fire in the hearth settled into a deep, orange glow, its light catching the amber of their half-empty pint glasses. The pub, once boisterous, had quieted down, leaving them in a pocket of warmth and low conversation. Dagbjort watched Elias trace a pattern with his finger on the condensation of his glass, his expression one of complete, unburdened peace. This was it, Dagbjort thought. This was the quiet centre he’d never known he was looking for. The idea of leaving, of this perfect day ending, felt like a flaw in the design of the world. He wanted to stay in this moment, suspended in the warm glow of the firelight and the simple, solid presence of the man sitting opposite him. The day had been a perfect circuit, and he had no desire to find the off-switch.

Their accommodation for the night was a small bed and breakfast a few streets away, run by a woman whose enthusiasm was matched only by her love for floral patterns. The room was a riot of chintz and potpourri, with a bed so high it required a running jump. To Dagbjort, whose aesthetic sensibilities were calibrated to the clean lines of a circuit board, the room was a bewildering assault on the senses. To Elias, it was “delightfully authentic” and “a charming example of provincial vernacular.” He’d immediately located a dusty book on local folklore left on the windowsill and was now propped against a mountain of frilled pillows, reading aloud about a local dragon while Dagbjort stood, feeling like a minimalist sculpture accidentally delivered to a fabric shop. But as he listened to the rise and fall of Elias’s voice, watching the way the dim, over-shaded bedside lamp lit his face, the chaotic florals of the room began to recede. The space, like Elias’s own flat, was cluttered and overwhelming, but at its centre was a point of warmth and focus that made everything else irrelevant.

The next morning, they wandered through the small market town, unwilling to let the weekend end. The air was crisp and clean, and the Sunday morning quiet was broken only by the sound of church bells. They bought coffee from a small bakery and browsed the stalls in the market square, Elias delighting in a display of artisanal cheese while Dagbjort found himself drawn to a stall selling beautifully crafted, handmade tools. It was on a side street, tucked between a butcher and a bookshop, that they found it: an antique shop whose windows were crammed with a century’s worth of discarded treasures and forgotten histories. Elias’s face lit up. “Oh, we have to,” he said, his voice full of the same reverent excitement he used for a newly discovered masterpiece. Dagbjort, who saw antique shops primarily as depositories of faulty wiring and woodworm, sighed with fond resignation and followed him in.

The shop smelled of beeswax and dust, a scent Dagbjort was beginning to associate with Elias’s passions. Elias moved through the narrow aisles with a practiced grace, his fingers trailing over dusty porcelain and the cracked leather of old books. Dagbjort followed, his own hands in his pockets, his tradesman’s eye automatically scanning for structural flaws and fire hazards. And then Elias stopped, completely still. He was staring into a cluttered corner, his expression one of rapturous discovery. Dagbjort followed his gaze, and his heart sank. It was a lamp. But it was not a lamp like the elegant, mid-century one in Elias’s flat. This lamp was a crime. It was a tall, floor-standing affair, its base a twisting, gilded monstrosity of what looked like three plump, leering cherubs wrestling a python. From this golden nightmare, a fluted column rose to a point where a vast, fringed lampshade of faded, rose-coloured silk hung at a jaunty angle. It was festooned with strings of plastic crystals that promised to cast a uniquely depressing light on any surface.

“Oh, my word,” Elias breathed, stepping closer as if approaching an altar. “Look at it, Dagbjort. It’s magnificent. Utterly, unashamedly vulgar. It’s late Victorian, trying for Rococo revival. The sheer, joyful bad taste of it! It’s a statement!” Dagbjort stared at it, his mind a frantic catalogue of its flaws. The gilt was flaking, one of the cherubs had a chipped wing, and the visible wiring was a brittle, fabric-covered horror story that made Elias’s sellotape incident look like a masterclass in electrical safety. It was, without a doubt, the ugliest object he had ever seen. “It’s a statement, alright,” Dagbjort muttered, “It’s stating that it wants to burn your house down.” But Elias wasn’t listening. He was circling the lamp, his eyes shining. “It’s for you,” he said, turning to Dagbjort, his face alight with the catastrophic joy of a terrible idea. “For your flat. It’s the perfect counterpoint! Your place is so calm, so… rational. It needs this! A flash of playful, historic irrationality! A memento mori to minimalism! It will be hilarious. It will be brilliant.”

And there it was. The catastrophic failure of judgement, the appalling aesthetic decision that had been waiting for them. It wasn’t Elias’s, not really. It was his. Because looking at Elias’s face, so full of genuine, unadulterated delight, so proud of this gesture, Dagbjort found he was physically incapable of saying no. He couldn’t bring himself to shatter that joy, to explain that the lamp was an aesthetic and electrical abomination. The love he felt for this man, in that moment, was so much larger than his love for clean lines and sensible design. So he heard himself say the words that would haunt him for the foreseeable future. “Yeah,” he said, a weak smile on his face. “Alright. Let’s get it.” The drive back to Gateshead was mostly silent. The lamp, swaddled in an old blanket like a hostage, lay in the back of the van. Dagbjort could feel its presence, a looming, gilded horror. With every mile that brought them closer to his serene, grey-and-navy living room, his sense of dread grew.

He carried it up the three flights of stairs to his flat, the cherubs digging uncomfortably into his side. Elias followed, carrying the lampshade like a sacred relic, beaming with anticipation. Dagbjort unlocked his front door and stepped into the calm of his home. It felt like leading a Trojan horse into the city walls. “Where shall we put it?” Elias asked, his voice echoing in the quiet hall. “The place of honour, I think.” He directed Dagbjort to the corner of the living room, next to the clean, modern lines of the sofa. Dagbjort set the lamp down. It was worse than he had imagined. It was a sequined peacock in a Quaker meeting house. It absorbed all the calm in the room and replaced it with a kind of desperate, theatrical gloom. Elias carefully placed the lampshade on top, tilting it to what he considered a jaunty, artistic angle. He stepped back, his hands on his hips, a proud creator surveying his work. He was utterly, blissfully happy. “Perfect,” he declared. “It’s absolutely, wonderfully terrible. Don’t you just love it?” Dagbjort looked from the monstrous lamp, a monument to bad taste and faulty wiring, to the face of the man he loved, which was shining with more pure, brilliant light than any lamp could ever hope to produce. He took a deep breath. “Yeah,” he said, the lie catching in his throat. “It’s… something else.” He knew, with a sinking, profound certainty, that he was going to spend his next available Saturday completely and secretly rewiring a gilded python, because that, apparently, was what love was.Chapter 6

The word “perfect” hung in the quiet, minimalist air of Dagbjort’s living room, a blatant falsehood that seemed to suck all the oxygen out of the space. Elias was beaming, a man utterly convinced of his own genius. He had not just bought a gift; he had performed an act of sophisticated cultural curation, introducing a playful postmodern irony into Dagbjort’s serene composition. Dagbjort, meanwhile, felt the same cold dread he experienced when walking onto a job site and seeing evidence of amateur DIY wiring. He wanted to throw a heavy blanket over the lamp, to contain its malevolent aura, to call the bomb squad. Instead, he just stood there, a weak, sick smile plastered on his face, a traitor to every principle of good design and electrical safety he held dear.

“Right then, the grand unveiling!” Elias declared, rubbing his hands together with glee. He located the lamp’s plug, a crumbling, yellowed piece of Bakelite with a frayed fabric cord, and headed towards the nearest wall socket. A primal scream of ‘NO!’ rose in Dagbjort’s throat, but his professional training suppressed it, replacing it with a mask of calm competence. “Hold on,” he said, his voice impressively steady. “Just let me have a look at that. The fuse might be ancient. Probably needs a modern three-amp.” It was the perfect excuse, plausible and entirely in character. Elias, who wouldn’t know an amp from an artichoke, handed the plug over with a trusting nod. “Good thinking. Always best to be safe.”

Dagbjort turned his back, cradling the plug as if it were a live grenade. He didn’t have a spare fuse on him, but his van keys were in his pocket, and on the keyring was a tiny, multi-tool screwdriver. With the dexterity of a safecracker, he prised open the crumbling plug. As he’d suspected, the inside was a catastrophe of corroded brass and perished rubber. The wiring was so brittle it flaked at his touch. It wasn’t just a fire hazard; it was a historical artefact of how fires used to start. There was no way he could fix it here, not properly. He needed to buy time. He tightened one of the screws a fraction, blew away some dust, and snapped the cover shut. It was a purely cosmetic act, the electrical equivalent of a placebo. “All seems… intact,” he lied through his teeth. “But let’s plug it into the surge protector, just in case. The wiring in these old buildings can be a bit variable.” He retrieved a heavy-duty, four-gang extension lead from his spare room, a piece of equipment he trusted implicitly, and plugged the lamp into it. At least if it blew, the protector’s fuse would be the first thing to go. He took a deep breath. “Right then. Moment of truth.” Elias stepped forward and, with a ceremonial flourish, clicked the switch on the lamp’s cord.

For a terrifying second, nothing happened. Then, with a faint, ominous crackle and a buzz like a dying hornet, the lamp shuddered into life. The light that bloomed under the vast, fringed lampshade was everything Dagbjort had feared. It was not a warm glow; it was a murky, rose-tinted gloom that seemed to absorb the clean white light from the rest of the room. It made the calm grey of his walls look faintly bruised, and the plastic crystals cast greasy, trembling rainbows across his pristine ceiling. It was the light of a forgotten seaside guesthouse, a light that smelled of damp and disappointment. Elias, however, was enchanted. “Oh, look at that!” he breathed, his face bathed in the sickly pink light. “It changes the whole atmosphere! It’s so decadent. It’s like a Toulouse-Lautrec painting. It’s wonderful.” Dagbjort looked at his beautiful, ordered living room, now visually polluted by a single, hideous object, and felt a profound sense of loss.

Living with the lamp was a form of low-grade psychological torture. It stood in the corner like a gaudy, uninvited relative who had overstayed their welcome and was judging his minimalist lifestyle. Every time Dagbjort entered the living room, his eyes were drawn to it, to the leering cherubs and the sad, dusty fringe. It was a monument to the single worst decision he had ever made. During the day, it was merely ugly. But at night, Elias would insist on turning it on, and their evenings on the sofa were spent in its moody, brothel-like glow. Elias would praise its “evocative ambience,” while Dagbjort felt like he was sitting in a migraine. He started developing a nervous tic, his gaze constantly flicking towards the socket, half-expecting to see smoke. He drank his tea faster, his nerves perpetually on edge. The lamp was a silent, third party in their relationship, and he was beginning to resent it.

The inevitable confrontation with Gaz happened the following Saturday. Dagbjort had offered to lend him a specialised crimping tool, and Gaz had insisted on picking it up, arriving with two cans of lager as a thank you. He walked into the living room, took one look at the corner, and stopped dead. He blinked several times, as if trying to clear a fault in his own optical wiring. The can of lager in his hand tilted precariously. “Dag,” he said, his voice a hushed, horrified whisper. “There appears to be a golden abomination from a gypsy’s nightmare standing in your living room.” He slowly circled the lamp, his expression a mixture of awe and profound disbelief. “What… what is it? Did you lose a bet? A very, very bad bet?” Dagbjort felt his face burn. “It’s a lamp, Gaz.” “That, mate, is not a lamp,” Gaz retorted, pointing a trembling finger at the cherubs. “That is what happens when a trophy, a chandelier, and a mythological horror have a three-way fight and everyone loses. Where did you get it? Please don’t say you bought it.”

The moment of choice was upon him. He could join in with Gaz, admit the lamp was a horror show, and share a moment of sanity with his old mate. Or he could defend it. He could defend Elias. He thought of Elias’s face, so full of joy in that dusty antique shop. He thought of how Elias had found beauty in his own, bare flat, how he had defended Dagbjort’s world. He straightened his shoulders. “It was a gift,” he said, his voice firm. “From Elias. It’s ironic.” Gaz stared at him, his jaw slack. “Ironic? Dag, it’s not ironic. It’s a cry for help. You hate this thing. I can see it in your eyes. You’ve got the same look you had when you had to rewire that rat-infested cellar in Heaton.” But Dagbjort held his ground. “It’s a statement piece,” he said, parroting Elias’s words, feeling like a complete fraud. “It’s about playful irrationality.” Gaz just shook his head slowly, a look of genuine pity on his face. “He’s got you, hasn’t he? The lad in tights. You’ve gone native. Just… promise me you didn’t do the wiring on it.” Dagbjort remained silent, which was all the answer Gaz needed. With a final, mournful look at the lamp, Gaz grabbed his crimping tool and backed out of the room. “I’ll see you Monday, mate,” he said, his tone full of sombre concern. “If you’re still here. If this thing hasn’t dragged you back to its dimension.”

After Gaz left, the silence in the flat felt heavy and accusing. The lamp seemed to stand a little taller, its gilded surfaces glinting smugly in the afternoon light. Gaz’s visit, as excruciating as it had been, had clarified everything. He couldn’t live like this. He couldn’t live with the lie, or the fear, or the sheer, soul-crushing ugliness of it. But getting rid of it was out of the question. It was a symbol of their perfect weekend, a testament to Elias’s love, however misguided his aesthetic choices. There was only one solution. He had to fix it. He had to tame the beast. He walked into his spare room, his workshop, and looked at his pegboard of perfectly organised tools. He would perform a full electrical restoration. New plug, new cord, new lamp holder, new switch. He would rebuild it from the inside out, making it safe, making it sound. The outside would still be an affront to God and man, but the inside, the part no one but him would ever see, would be perfect. It would be a secret act of love, a hidden piece of integrity inside a gilded cage of horrors.

That night, after Elias had gone home, Dagbjort sat on his sofa in the dark, the room lit only by the lamp’s sickly, rose-tinted glow. He looked at the wrestling cherubs and the sad, drooping fringe. He hated it. He hated it with a pure, uncomplicated passion. But as he looked, he saw the reflection of his own face in one of the plastic crystals, distorted and faintly pink. And for a moment, he didn’t see himself. He saw Elias’s beaming smile in the antique shop. He saw the joy, the absolute certainty that he was giving a wonderful, thoughtful gift. The lamp was not just a lamp. It was a story. It was the punchline to a joke he shared with the man he was falling in love with. It was the physical proof of a love big enough and strange enough to bridge the gap between a minimalist Gateshead flat and a Rococo revival nightmare. A slow smile spread across Dagbjort’s face. He could hate the lamp and love the man who gave it to him. He could despise the aesthetic and cherish the sentiment. He had a job to do. He had to make it safe, not just for his flat, but for the story it represented. The beast in the corner wasn't an enemy. It was just a very, very complicated problem that needed solving with a steady hand and a roll of electrical tape.Chapter 7

Operation Cherub Rescue, as Dagbjort had grimly dubbed it in his head, could only be attempted on a Tuesday. Elias had his evening class, followed by his regular departmental meeting, giving Dagbjort a solid four-hour window of opportunity. He laid out a fresh dust sheet on his immaculate living room floor, a concession that pained him deeply, and placed his open tool bag beside it. The tools were arranged with a surgeon’s precision: wire strippers, crimpers, a full set of insulated screwdrivers, a gleaming new brass lamp holder, a modern three-pin plug, a fresh roll of green and yellow earth-sleeving, and a generous coil of high-quality, three-core flex cable. He stood before the lamp, which looked even more smug and garish in the bright afternoon light, and took a deep, steadying breath. "Right, you gilded monstrosity," he muttered under his breath, "Let's see what horrors you're hiding." It felt less like a repair job and more like an exorcism.

The disassembly was a journey into a Victorian heart of darkness. The base was unexpectedly heavy, weighted with what felt like sand or rubble, sealed inside with a disc of rusted tin that crumbled at the edges when he prised it off. The fluted column was held onto the cherubic nightmare by a single, corroded bolt that required a full ten minutes of struggle and a liberal application of WD-40, filling the air with its distinctive, oily smell. Every component seemed to have been designed with a spiteful disregard for future maintenance. As he finally managed to separate the main stem from the base, a shower of fine, brown dust and what looked suspiciously like the desiccated exoskeletons of long-dead spiders rained down onto the dust sheet. He stared at the mess, his professional soul weeping. This wasn't a product of craftsmanship; it was a crime against engineering, held together by gravity, rust, and a century of blind optimism.

The real horror was, as he had known it would be, the wiring. The original fabric-covered cord had been threaded through the column with no protective grommets, meaning decades of minute movements had rubbed it raw against the sharp metal edges of the casting holes inside. It was a miracle of statistical improbability that it hadn't shorted out and incinerated itself years ago. He pulled the old wire out with the careful, gingerly movements of someone handling an unexploded bomb. It came away in brittle, crumbling sections, the fabric insulation flaking away to reveal blackened, corroded copper. He laid the pathetic remains on the floor, a sad testament to a bygone era of blissful ignorance about electrical fires. This wasn't just a repair; it was a public service.

Then came the good part. The restoration. This was his territory, his sanctuary. With the lamp’s ugly skeleton laid bare, he began the methodical, satisfying process of renewal. He meticulously cleaned the inside of the column with a bottle brush he kept for such occasions, clearing out a century of grime and debris. He fitted protective rubber grommets at the entry and exit points for the new cable, a small but crucial detail that brought him an immense sense of peace. He then threaded the new, clean, flexible three-core cable through the ghastly golden body. It was a strange juxtaposition: the modern, functional, safety-conscious wire running through a form dedicated to pure, frivolous ugliness. He felt like a priest performing last rites and a baptism all at once.

He worked with a quiet, focused intensity, the world shrinking to the small, precise movements of his hands. The new brass lamp holder was wired with perfect, uniform loops of copper, each screw tightened to the correct torque. Live to brown, neutral to blue, and most importantly, the new earth wire, clad in its smart green and yellow sleeve, securely fastened with a star washer to the lamp's metal casing, ensuring that the leering cherubs could never again threaten to deliver a fatal shock. At the other end, he fitted the new, modern plug, stripping the wires to the precise length, fitting the correct three-amp fuse, and ensuring the cord grip was tightly secured. Every connection was clean, every termination perfect. It was a work of hidden art, a secret symphony of safety and function concealed within a cacophony of bad taste.

Reassembling the beast was easier, now that he understood its bizarre internal logic. The freshly oiled bolt went in smoothly. The base was secured. He cleaned the flaking gilt as best he could with a soft cloth, an act of care that felt almost traitorous. Finally, he stood the lamp back in its corner and replaced the ridiculous, rose-tinted lampshade. To the casual eye, nothing had changed. It was the same monstrous monument to decorative excess. But Dagbjort knew differently. He knew that beneath the surface, it was now sound. It was safe. He plugged it into the wall socket – directly, this time, with no need for the surge protector – took a breath, and flicked the new, modern switch he’d installed on the cord. A clean, instantaneous light filled the shade. There was no crackle, no buzz, no hesitation. The light was still a depressing, murky pink, but it was a steady, confident pink. The monster had been tamed.

He cleared every last speck of dust, packed his tools away, and buried the old, condemned wiring in the bottom of the outside bin like the evidence of a crime. By the time Elias arrived, bringing the scent of cold night air and the taste of peppermint tea from a flask, the living room was once again a picture of minimalist calm, albeit one with a gilded tumour in the corner. Dagbjort’s heart hammered a little as Elias shrugged off his coat and immediately went to turn on the lamp, their established ritual. The light bloomed, steady and sure. Elias stood before it for a moment, head tilted. Dagbjort held his breath. “Hmm,” Elias said, squinting. He stepped closer, peering at the shade. “That’s funny. The light seems… less angry tonight.” He looked at Dagbjort, a quizzical smile on his face. “Did you change the bulb?” “Something like that,” Dagbjort said, his voice miraculously even. “Just gave it a bit of a clean.”

Elias accepted the explanation without a second thought and curled up on the sofa, launching into an amusing, exasperated story about a student who thought the Renaissance was a Beyoncé album. Dagbjort sat beside him, half-listening, his gaze fixed on the lamp. It was still hideous. It was still a blight on his carefully curated calm. But it was no longer a source of anxiety. It was a secret collaboration. A bridge between his world and Elias’s, built of ugly, gilded cherubs but wired with care, integrity, and a deep, abiding love. He had taken this symbol of their chaotic, beautiful connection and he had made it safe. He had made it proper. And as he looked at the awful, wonderful, terrible lamp, now shining with a quiet, steady, reassuring light, Dagbjort realised with a startling clarity that he wouldn’t get rid of it for the world.Operation Cherub Rescue, as Dagbjort had grimly dubbed it in his head, could only be attempted on a Tuesday. Elias had his evening class, followed by his regular departmental meeting, giving Dagbjort a solid four-hour window of opportunity.

He felt like a priest performing last rites and a baptism all at once.

He worked with a quiet, focused intensity, the world shrinking to the small, precise movements of his hands. The new brass lamp holder was wired with perfect, uniform loops of copper, each screw tightened to the correct torque. Live to brown, neutral to blue, and most importantly, the new earth wire, clad in its smart green and yellow sleeve, securely fastened with a star washer to the lamp's metal casing, ensuring that the leering cherubs could never again threaten to deliver a fatal shock. At the other end, he fitted the new, modern plug, stripping the wires to the precise length, fitting the correct three-amp fuse, and ensuring the cord grip was tightly secured. Every connection was clean, every termination perfect. It was a work of hidden art, a secret symphony of safety and function concealed within a cacophony of bad taste.

Reassembling the beast was easier, now that he understood its bizarre internal logic. The freshly oiled bolt went in smoothly. The base was secured. He cleaned the flaking gilt as best he could with a soft cloth, an act of care that felt almost traitorous. Finally, he stood the lamp back in its corner and replaced the ridiculous, rose-tinted lampshade. To the casual eye, nothing had changed. It was the same monstrous monument to decorative excess. But Dagbjort knew differently. He knew that beneath the surface, it was now sound. It was safe. He plugged it into the wall socket – directly, this time, with no need for the surge protector – took a breath, and flicked the new, modern switch he’d installed on the cord. A clean, instantaneous light filled the shade. There was no crackle, no buzz, no hesitation. The light was still a depressing, murky pink, but it was a steady, confident pink. The monster had been tamed.

He cleared every last speck of dust, packed his tools away, and buried the old, condemned wiring in the bottom of the outside bin like the evidence of a crime. By the time Elias arrived, bringing the scent of cold night air and the taste of peppermint tea from a flask, the living room was once again a picture of minimalist calm, albeit one with a gilded tumour in the corner. Dagbjort’s heart hammered a little as Elias shrugged off his coat and immediately went to turn on the lamp, their established ritual. The light bloomed, steady and sure. Elias stood before it for a moment, head tilted. Dagbjort held his breath. “Hmm,” Elias said, squinting. He stepped closer, peering at the shade. “That’s funny. The light seems… less angry tonight.” He looked at Dagbjort, a quizzical smile on his face. “Did you change the bulb?” “Something like that,” Dagbjort said, his voice miraculously even. “Just gave it a bit of a clean.”

Elias accepted the explanation without a second thought and curled up on the sofa, launching into an amusing, exasperated story about a student who thought the Renaissance was a Beyoncé album. Dagbjort sat beside him, half-listening, his gaze fixed on the lamp. It was still hideous. It was still a blight on his carefully curated calm. But it was no longer a source of anxiety. It was a secret collaboration. A bridge between his world and Elias’s, built of ugly, gilded cherubs but wired with care, integrity, and a deep, abiding love. He had taken this symbol of their chaotic, beautiful connection and he had made it safe. He had made it proper. And as he looked at the awful, wonderful, terrible lamp, now shining with a quiet, steady, reassuring light, Dagbjort realised with a startling clarity that he wouldn’t get rid of it for the world.The lamp became a silent fixture in the landscape of their lives, a grotesque but benign landmark. Dagbjort’s initial horror had, over time, mellowed into a kind of wry, secret affection. He would catch sight of it from the corner of his eye and feel not a jolt of aesthetic revulsion, but a low, pleasant hum of private satisfaction. The leering cherubs no longer seemed malevolent; they were simply the gaudy guardians of a secret, a testament to an afternoon spent with a bottle brush, a multi-tool, and an act of profound, pragmatic love. He knew its secrets now. He knew that beneath the flaking gilt and the dusty silk, its heart was sound, its wiring perfect, its earth connection unimpeachable. It was a joke only he truly understood, and its pink, gloomy light, once a source of deep irritation, now just felt like part of the scenery, the strange and brilliant backdrop to his life with Elias.

This new way of seeing began to bleed into the rest of his life, colouring the black-and-white schematics of his trade. He found himself on a complex commercial rewiring job in a repurposed old warehouse in Ouseburn, staring up at a vast, intricate web of metal conduits and trunking that snaked across the high ceiling. A year ago, he would have seen only a logistical problem, a series of circuits to be tested and traced. Now, he saw the composition. He saw the deliberate lines, the rhythmic spacing of the junction boxes, the way the stark, industrial forms created a pattern of light and shadow against the old brickwork. It was a kind of brutalist sculpture, functional and honest. He found himself explaining to a baffled apprentice why they had to run a particular length of conduit parallel to a steel beam, not for any technical reason, but because it was "more elegant" and "respected the integrity of the space." The apprentice had just stared at him, but Dagbjort didn't care. He was no longer just a sparky. He was a man who understood the physics of light, and was now, to his own quiet surprise, beginning to understand its poetry as well.

The partial confession came one rainy Sunday. They had spent the day in a state of blissful inertia, moving only from the sofa to the kitchen and back again. The world outside was a grey wash, and inside, the flat was a warm, quiet haven. Elias was reading aloud from a book on Victorian design, occasionally stopping to point out a particularly ludicrous piece of furniture. He paused, his gaze falling on the cherub lamp, which was casting its signature rosy gloom over his pages. He smiled, a soft, thoughtful expression on his face. "You know," he said, "I've grown incredibly fond of this monstrous thing. But I’ve been meaning to ask you. That first night, it crackled. It sounded like it was about to immolate itself. Now it's as quiet as the grave. You did more than just clean it, didn't you?"

Dagbjort looked at Elias, at his kind, intelligent eyes, and knew that the time for evasion was over. The secret was part of the joke, but the deception wasn't part of their connection. He set his mug down on the coffee table. "Alright," he admitted, a slow grin spreading across his face. "I might have performed some minor surgery. The plug was a death trap and the internal wiring was basically dust held together by wishful thinking. So I replaced the flex. And the lamp holder. And the switch. And I gave it a proper earth. Apart from that, I barely touched it." He watched Elias’s face, expecting surprise, maybe even a hint of embarrassment at having bought such a dangerous object. Instead, Elias’s expression softened into one of overwhelming fondness. He reached across the sofa and took Dagbjort’s hand, his fingers lacing through his. "Of course you did," he said, his voice full of warmth. "You saw something broken and you made it safe. You saw this… ridiculous, ugly, beautiful thing that I love, and you gave it integrity. That's the most 'you' thing I can possibly imagine." He brought Dagbjort’s hand to his lips and kissed his knuckles, a gesture of such tenderness it made Dagbjort’s heart ache in the best possible way. The secret was out, not as a confession of a lie, but as a shared understanding of who they both were.

A few weeks later, on a crisp, bright autumn afternoon, they walked across the Tyne Bridge. It was Dagbjort’s idea. They stood in one of the pedestrian alcoves, the city spread out on both sides, the river a shimmering ribbon below. The traffic thundered past, a constant roar of motion. Dagbjort placed his hands on the cool, painted iron of the railing, feeling the faint vibration of the structure. “This is it,” he said, more to himself than to Elias. “The sheer, stubborn integrity of it all.” He ran his hand over a line of huge, round-headed rivets, each one a point of connection, a small, perfect tear of steel holding two worlds together. Elias stood beside him, not looking at the view, but at the bridge itself, at the details Dagbjort was pointing out. “It’s like a Caravaggio,” Elias said thoughtfully. “The way the light hits it. It’s not soft or divine. It’s a real, industrial light. It picks out the strength, the texture, the grime. It doesn’t hide the work. It celebrates it.” Dagbjort turned to look at him, a slow smile spreading across his face. Elias had seen it. He had seen the bridge through Dagbjort’s eyes, and translated it into his own language, and they had arrived at the exact same point of understanding. The ghost of solder and the ghost of art history had finally merged.

He thought back to that first class, to the feeling of being a fraud in a foreign country. He had been a man who understood things that were put together properly, and he had seen no connection between a clean electrical join and a painting. Now, standing here with Elias, the wind whipping at their jackets, he saw that he had been wrong. It was all about connection. The artist connecting a line to a colour. The engineer connecting a girder to a pylon. A sparky connecting a live wire to a terminal. Two men, from two different worlds, finding a current running between them that was warm and quiet and undeniable. He looked at Elias, whose face was full of life and intelligence, his eyes shining with the same reflected light from the river that Dagbjort could see. A ridiculous, hopeful, brilliant thought flickered into life, no longer dangerous, but solid and real and true: this was the start of everything. This was the main event. A switch had been flicked inside him all those months ago, and the strange and brilliant light it had flooded him with was no longer strange at all. It was just the steady, unwavering glow of being home.The first proper frost of winter had silvered the inside of the windowpanes in Dagbjort’s flat, etching fern-like patterns onto the glass. Outside, the sky over Gateshead was a low, heavy grey, but inside, the central heating hummed with quiet efficiency and the air was warm and still. The cherub lamp, now referred to between them simply as ‘The Beast’, stood silent in its corner, its power cord neatly coiled, its garishness having become a familiar, almost comforting, part of the landscape. Their lives had settled into a rhythm that spanned the Tyne, a weekly migration between the serene order of Dagbjort’s flat and the glorious, literary chaos of Elias’s. Dagbjort’s world had acquired a few more books, left on his bedside table or stacked neatly by the sofa. Elias’s world, in turn, had acquired a new, properly installed shelf in the kitchen, a small but impeccably organised toolbox tucked discreetly behind an armchair, and a general, if slight, reduction in trip hazards.

The next great project was born of necessity. Elias had called Dagbjort one afternoon in a state of mild panic. A precarious, seven-foot tower of hardback art books, which had been leaning at an increasingly perilous angle for months, had finally surrendered to gravity, collapsing in a slow, thunderous cascade that had, in his words, “nearly taken out the good teapot.” The incident had forced a concession: the book situation was no longer sustainable. It was time for a structural solution. This solution arrived in three long, impossibly heavy flat-pack boxes, bearing the name ‘BIBLIOTEK MAXIMUS’ and a diagram of a smiling, ethnically ambiguous family admiring a bookshelf so vast it seemed to defy the laws of physics.

Dagbjort arrived at Elias’s flat that Saturday morning to find the boxes open and their contents spread across the entire living room floor. It looked like a timber yard had exploded. There were endless planks of laminate wood-effect, bags of screws and dowels numbered with a dizzying logic, and a set of instructions printed on paper so thin it was almost transparent. Elias was sitting cross-legged in the middle of the carnage, staring at the instruction booklet with the baffled, intense frown of a scholar trying to decipher a lost Dead Sea Scroll. “I think we have a problem,” he announced, looking up at Dagbjort. “According to Diagram C, we are supposed to insert the ‘svinging kamlås’ into the ‘pre-drilled receiving aperture’. The kamlås, however, bears a striking resemblance to a character from theban script, and I can’t seem to find an aperture that looks remotely receptive.”

Dagbjort surveyed the scene, a slow smile spreading across his face. He set down the bag containing a flask of tea and two pork pies and rolled up his sleeves. This was not a problem. This was a puzzle. It was a big, wooden circuit waiting to be connected. “Right,” he said, taking charge. “First rule of flat-pack: ignore the instructions. They’re not instructions, they’re philosophy. They’re designed to make you question the nature of existence, not build a bookshelf. Let’s just look at the bits.” He picked up two long planks and a shorter one. “See? It’s a box. Two sides, a top, a bottom. All we have to do is make the box, put the back on to stop it wobbling, and then put the shelves in. Easy.” Elias looked from the incomprehensible diagram to Dagbjort’s confident face, a look of profound relief dawning. “You make it sound so simple.” “It is simple,” Dagbjort said, picking up a bag of wooden dowels. “It’s just a big box for your stories.”

The next few hours were a masterclass in their dynamic. Dagbjort worked with a swift, logical economy of motion, his hands seeming to know instinctively which screw went where, how to align the panels perfectly, how to use the flimsy little Allen key without rounding it off. He was in his element, imposing order on the chaos of laminate and steel. Elias, determined to help, was appointed to the role of ‘assistant’. His job was to pass Dagbjort the correct components, a task he approached with the solemnity of a surgical nurse, albeit one who frequently confused a cam-lock with a shelf-peg. At one point, tasked with holding a side panel steady, he held it upside down, his attention having been caught by the wood-grain effect. “It’s fascinating, isn’t it?” he mused, tracing the pattern with a finger. “A photograph of wood, printed onto powdered, glued wood dust. It’s a simulation of the very thing it’s replaced. A sort of postmodernist paradox in furniture form.” Dagbjort, holding a heavy shelf support and a power drill, just looked at him with fond exasperation. “Elias. The other way up, mate. Unless you want the shelves to be diagonal.”

By late afternoon, the BIBLIOTEK MAXIMUS stood tall and proud against the main wall. It was perfectly level, flawlessly assembled, and as solid as the foundations of the Tyne Bridge. It transformed the room. The floor was suddenly visible. The chaos had been contained, given a grand, formal structure. They stood back, admiring their handiwork, two pork pies and several mugs of tea later. “Good heavens,” Elias said, his voice full of genuine awe. “It’s magnificent. It’s a cathedral for books.” The final, most important part of the job began. Together, they started to fill the shelves. It was a slow, careful process. For Elias, it was like reacquainting himself with old friends. He would pick up a book, his face lighting up, and tell Dagbjort its story. “This one,” he said, holding up a slim volume of poetry, its cover worn and soft, “I bought this in a little shop in Hay-on-Wye the day after I finished my PhD. I was completely broke, but I had to have it. I read it on the train all the way back to London.” Dagbjort took the book and placed it carefully on a shelf. He was not just handling paper and cardboard; he was handling pieces of Elias’s life, giving them a safe, ordered home.

When the last book was shelved, they collapsed onto the sofa, tired but triumphant. The living room was the same, but different. It was still Elias’s room, a testament to a life lived in words, but now it had Dagbjort’s mark on it too – a quiet, unseen integrity in its main structure. As dusk settled, Elias got up to fetch them both a celebratory whisky. Dagbjort’s eyes scanned the newly populated shelves, a landscape of spines and stories. His gaze settled on a small, silver-framed photograph he hadn’t noticed before, now given pride of place on a central shelf. It was an old, slightly faded picture of three people standing in a sunny garden. A much younger Elias, all awkward limbs and a shy smile, stood between a woman with kind eyes and the same dark, unruly hair, and a man with a stern, proud face, his hands clasped firmly behind his back. “Who’s that?” Dagbjort asked softly, as Elias handed him a glass. Elias followed his gaze, and for a moment, he was silent. He sat down beside Dagbjort, the whisky glass resting in his hands. “That,” he said, his voice quiet, stripped of its usual academic flourish, “is my mum and dad. Outside the house I grew up in. A long time ago.” He took a slow sip of his drink, his eyes still on the photograph, and Dagbjort knew, with a gentle certainty, that another door was opening, another connection was about to be made, another story was about to find its proper place.The silence that followed was different from any they had shared before. It wasn’t the comfortable quiet of a pub corner or the serene stillness of Dagbjort’s flat. This was a silence with history in it, weighted with the unspoken narratives of a lifetime. Dagbjort didn’t move. He didn’t prompt or pry. He just sat beside Elias on the sofa, a solid, patient presence, and waited. He understood that some panels had to be offered, they couldn’t be forced into place. He watched as Elias stared at the small, smiling ghost of himself in the photograph, his knuckles white around the whisky glass, and felt the familiar, protective urge to fix something. But this was a fault line that ran too deep for a screwdriver and a roll of tape. This required a different set of tools: quietness, and time, and a willingness to simply listen.

“My father was the Dean of the cathedral,” Elias began, his voice losing its usual articulate rhythm, becoming flatter, more factual. “A formidable man. He believed in God, in tradition, and in the immutable rightness of his own opinions. He saw the world as a text to be interpreted correctly, and he held the only authorised edition.” He took a slow, deliberate sip of whisky, the gesture a small fortification against the memory. “He wasn’t a cruel man, not intentionally. He was just… rigid. He had this way of looking at things he didn’t approve of, not with anger, but with a kind of profound, weary disappointment. It was far more effective. Anger you can fight. Disappointment just seeps into your bones.”

He gestured with his glass towards the photograph. “My mother… she was the opposite. She was the colour. She was the one who bought me my first box of paints, who took me to the library on her own card so my father wouldn't see the art books I was borrowing. She understood that I needed… more. More than just the grey stone and the tolling bells of the close. But she was quiet about it. Her support was a kind of loving conspiracy, a secret we kept between us. When my father was home, the paints were put away, and the art books were hidden under my bed. I learned very early that my passions were something to be concealed, something slightly shameful, like a secret vice.”

Dagbjort listened, the pieces of Elias’s history clicking into place. The evasiveness about his family, the way he spoke of a life of libraries and unspoken rules, the sheer, explosive joy he took in things that were unapologetically bold and colourful. It was all a reaction, a lifetime spent pushing back against the grey certainty of the Dean. Dagbjort thought of Gaz, of his easy mockery and his call to ‘not get any ideas’. It was the same thing, just with a different accent. It was the dismissal of a world you didn’t understand, the fear of a passion that served no obvious, practical purpose. And he felt a quiet, burning anger on behalf of the small, awkward boy in the photograph, who had to hide his art books under his bed.

“He wanted me to read law,” Elias continued, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance. “Or, if I had the calling, which he sincerely doubted, to enter the church. Something with structure. Something with a clear, established purpose. When I told him I had accepted a place to read History of Art, he didn't shout. He just sat in his study for a very long time. When he came out, he looked at me with that familiar, tired disappointment and said, ‘Elias, you are choosing a life of utter frivolity. You will spend your days in the contemplation of trivialities.’ He never once asked to see my dissertation. He never visited a gallery with me. In his eyes, the work I have dedicated my life to, the thing that brings me the most profound joy… it was a failure of character. A triviality.”

The final word hung in the air, heavy and sharp. This was the source of it, Dagbjort realised. The deep, foundational hurt. It wasn't just a disagreement; it was a fundamental invalidation of who Elias was. Dagbjort put his own glass down on the table, the clink unnaturally loud in the quiet room. He turned on the sofa to face Elias properly. He didn’t know the right words, the comforting academic phrases. He only knew his own blunt, solid truth. “He was wrong,” Dagbjort said, his voice low but fierce. “He was just wrong. It’s not trivial. It’s… it’s a current. You said it. It’s a current that’s still running. You spend your life helping people see that, helping them read the wiring diagram. That’s not trivial. That’s essential. He just… he didn’t have the eyes for it. Some people don’t.”

Elias finally turned from the photograph to look at Dagbjort. His eyes were shining with unshed tears, but his mouth was curved into a small, fragile smile. The simple, unequivocal validation, spoken in their own private language, had landed with the force of a revelation. “The eyes for it,” he repeated softly, as if tasting the words. He let out a long, shaky breath, and some of the decades-old tension seemed to leave his shoulders. He reached out and took Dagbjort’s hand, not in the easy, public way of the pub, but with a tight, grateful grip, his thumb tracing the calluses on Dagbjort’s palm. The grand, newly-built bookshelf stood behind them, a silent, solid structure they had built together. It held the stories of Elias’s life, and now, finally, it held the most important one of all, brought out into the light, into a space that was safe, and warm, and properly put together.Chapter 9

The silence in the room was no longer heavy; it was resonant. The story of the Dean and his quiet, devastating disapproval had been laid out between them, and Dagbjort’s simple, solid rebuttal had not erased it, but had contained it, putting a frame around the pain and hanging it in the past. Elias’s grip on his hand was tight, a grounding anchor in the swell of decades-old emotion. He finally let out a long, shuddering sigh, the sound of a weight being set down after a journey of many years. The tension that he always carried in his shoulders, a slight, scholarly stoop, seemed to lessen, as if a cracked foundation had finally been underpinned. He looked at Dagbjort, his eyes clear and impossibly grateful, and for a moment, he was speechless. The man of words, the orator who could hold a classroom spellbound with the history of a single brushstroke, had no language for the profound relief of being so completely, so simply, understood.

Dagbjort felt the powerful, churning emotion in the room, and his instincts, as always, defaulted to the practical. He gave Elias’s hand a final, firm squeeze and then stood up. He did not offer platitudes or awkward reassurances. He just went to the kitchen. It was his default setting in the face of feelings too big for words: apply heat and water, create comfort. He filled the kettle, the familiar rush of water a grounding sound. He found the box of Yorkshire Tea, his own brand, which now lived permanently on Elias’s counter next to a tin of obscure Italian coffee beans. He moved with a quiet purpose, rinsing the whisky glasses and setting out two clean mugs. It was a small, domestic act, a ritual of care that felt more eloquent than any speech he could have made. He was making a cup of tea, and in doing so, he was saying, *I am here. This is a safe harbour. The storm is over.*

He returned with the two steaming mugs, handing one to Elias. Their fingers brushed, a familiar, pleasant jolt. Elias took the mug in both hands, letting the warmth seep into his palms. He looked down into the dark, swirling liquid. “Thank you, Dagbjort,” he said, his voice quiet but steady now. “For… all of it. The bookshelf. And the listening.” He looked up, a small, wry smile touching his lips. “Most people, when I’ve mentioned my father, have offered psychoanalysis. You offered a structural assessment. It was far more helpful.” Dagbjort just shrugged, a slight flush rising on his neck. “He was just a bloke with a bad opinion. Everyone’s got one of them. Doesn’t make it a fact.” He took a sip of his tea. “And besides, building stuff is easy. It’s just putting the bits together in the right order. You do the hard job.”

They sat in a comfortable silence for a long time, the quiet punctuated only by the soft clink of mugs and the distant hum of the city. The shared vulnerability had not created an awkwardness between them; it had forged a deeper, more resilient connection. The final barrier, the polite distance one maintains around the old, foundational wounds of another person, was gone. They were no longer just two men sharing their worlds; they were two men building a new one, a shared territory where a sparky from Gateshead could have a valid opinion on the Italian Renaissance, and an art historian could be gently steered away from using a bread knife as a screwdriver. In this new world, their skills were not in opposition, but in beautiful, complementary alignment.

The next morning, Dagbjort woke to the smell of frying bacon. He opened his eyes to the unfamiliar sight of daylight slanting across Elias’s book-lined bedroom. He sat up, and saw that Elias was not in the bed beside him. He pulled on a t-shirt and went into the living room, where he found Elias in the small kitchen alcove, a tea towel tucked into the belt of his dressing gown, wielding a spatula with an air of intense, uncoordinated concentration. On the table, two plates were set with a precision that was entirely uncharacteristic of Elias, and which Dagbjort recognised with a jolt of affection as a loving imitation of his own ordered style. “I’m attempting a fry-up,” Elias announced, without turning around. “I found a YouTube tutorial. Apparently, the secret is low heat and an almost meditative patience. I’m not sure I have either, but the intent is there.”

Dagbjort leaned against the doorframe, a wide, genuine smile on his face, feeling a wave of happiness so simple and profound it almost took his breath away. The grand dramas of art and the deep wounds of the past had their place, but this, he thought, was the real thing. This was the substance of it all. The quiet, “trivial” moments. The smell of bacon in a book-filled flat. The shared, simple pleasure of a Sunday morning. After they had eaten the surprisingly excellent bacon sandwiches, they sat on the sofa, mugs of tea in hand, the new bookshelf standing like a silent, benevolent sentinel behind them. Elias seemed lighter, the usual thoughtful intensity in his eyes replaced with a playful, creative spark. He looked around the room, at their collaborative masterpiece, and then his gaze shifted, looking at Dagbjort, and at the idea of Dagbjort’s flat. “You know,” he said, a new idea beginning to form. “I’ve been thinking. Your flat has a serene, minimalist integrity. But integrity doesn’t have to mean emptiness.” He paused, a familiar, mischievous glint in his eye. “It needs a picture. Not a photograph of a bridge, as magnificent as it is. It needs a painting. Something with colour. Something with… a bit of joyful irrationality.”

Dagbjort braced himself, a vivid flashback of gilded cherubs and rose-tinted gloom flashing through his mind. But Elias was already shaking his head, laughing. “No, no, not another antique shop nightmare. I’ve learned my lesson. I was thinking we could find one. Together. A proper one. We could go and look at some of the graduate shows, or the little galleries in Ouseburn. Find something by someone young, someone just starting out. We could choose it. It would be ours.” The proposition was gentle, collaborative, a stark contrast to the unilateral imposition of The Beast. This wasn’t Elias trying to fix Dagbjort’s space; this was an invitation to create something new within it, together. It was a project that wasn’t about repair or restoration, but about pure, joyful creation. Dagbjort looked at Elias’s eager, hopeful face, and the last vestiges of his aesthetic caution melted away. He thought of his calm, grey walls. He thought of them with a splash of unexpected, brilliant colour. A statement. Not an ironic one, but a real one. “Yeah,” he said, his smile matching Elias’s. “Alright. Let’s go and get a picture.”Chapter 10

The search for the painting began the following Saturday. They drove to the Ouseburn Valley, the cultural crucible of the city where the industrial past and the artistic present were fused together. Red brick railway arches, dark with a century of coal dust, now housed artists’ studios and microbreweries. The air smelled of the river, damp stone, and the faint, sweet scent of hops. It was a landscape that belonged to both of them, a place of work and a place of creation. Elias was practically vibrating with excitement, peering down cobbled alleyways and pointing out vibrant murals splashed across old warehouse walls. Dagbjort, at the wheel of his van, navigated the narrow streets with a quiet sense of homecoming, feeling the familiar geography of the place while seeing it anew through Elias’s eyes.

Their first few gallery visits were interesting failures. In one pristine, white-walled space, they stood before a vast canvas of minimalist black stripes. “Technically accomplished,” Elias murmured, his head tilted, “but it’s a conversation Rothko was having seventy years ago. It feels like an echo.” Dagbjort, meanwhile, had noticed that the heavy canvas was hung from two flimsy-looking D-rings screwed directly into the frame. “That’ll pull out of the pine in a couple of years,” he said, his practical eye seeing a future problem, not a present artwork. “Should have used plates.” They looked at each other and shared a small, conspiratorial smile. Their combined standards, it turned out, were impossibly high.

They found it in a less formal setting, a graduate exhibition housed in a repurposed Victorian pottery. The space was noisy and crowded, a riot of bold experiments and youthful ambition. Tucked away in a corner, lit by a single, stark spotlight, was a square canvas that stopped them both dead. It was a painting of the old gasometers on the south bank of the river, their intricate, skeletal frames stark against a sky that was a violent, impossible blaze of deep orange and searing violet. The artist had rendered the metalwork not in a realistic grey, but in a deep, shimmering cobalt blue, the paint laid on so thick it was almost sculptural. It was not a photorealistic depiction; it was the feeling of seeing those industrial giants at sunset, their muscular grace imbued with a fierce, almost romantic energy.

Dagbjort felt a jolt of recognition. He saw the structure, the honest, unadorned engineering of a thing built to do a job, a subject he understood with an instinctual intimacy. But he saw it through a new lens, charged with the kind of raw, emotional power he now associated with Elias’s world. It was a wiring diagram of the soul, but the soul was that of his own city. He turned to Elias and saw the same stunned recognition on his face. Elias wasn’t seeing the gasometers; he was seeing the sublime, a Turner-esque storm of colour and light, a bold, defiant beauty found in the most overlooked of places. He saw the confidence of the brushwork, the sheer, joyful irrationality of the palette. They looked at each other, and in the noisy, crowded room, a perfect, silent understanding passed between them. They didn’t need to discuss it. This was the one.

The artist, a young woman with paint-splattered jeans and a nervous energy, was hovering near her work. Elias approached her first, his praise measured and academic, speaking of her debt to German Expressionism and the confident handling of the colour field. The artist blushed, pleased but slightly intimidated. Then Dagbjort stepped forward. He pointed to a thick, textured slash of the cobalt blue paint. “That’s amazing,” he said, his voice full of genuine admiration. “How did you get that texture? It’s like you’ve plastered it on. It’s got a real weight to it.” The artist’s face broke into a real, unguarded smile, her nervousness vanishing. “It’s cold wax medium,” she explained enthusiastically. “Mixed in with the oil paint. It gives it body. I wanted it to feel… solid. Like the real thing.” Dagbjort nodded, a deep appreciation for the technical problem-solving, for the sheer work of it, shining in his eyes. The artist seemed more gratified by his simple, practical question than by all of Elias’s art-historical analysis.

They carried the painting, carefully wrapped in bubble wrap, back to Dagbjort’s flat. It sat on the sofa between them for a while, an unseen presence, while they drank tea and talked about their day. The anticipation was part of the process, a quiet ceremony. Finally, Dagbjort stood up. “Right then,” he said. “Let’s get this thing on the wall.” He retrieved his tools from the spare room: the tape measure, the pencil, the spirit level, the power drill. He moved with a meticulous, focused calm, measuring the wall space, calculating the centre point, marking the drill holes with a surgeon’s precision. This was his art, the application of order and integrity. Elias directed from across the room, his role purely compositional. “A fraction to the left, I think. To balance the doorway. Yes… perfect. Right there.” Dagbjort drilled the holes, inserted the heavy-duty wall plugs, and screwed in the hooks. It was a foundation built to last.

Together, they unwrapped the painting and lifted it into place. Dagbjort stepped back to stand beside Elias, and they looked at the wall. The effect was instantaneous and transformative. The shock of violent, beautiful colour on the calm grey wall did not clash; it sang. It was a focal point, a blast of energy and life that made the whole room feel more complete, more intentional. The subject matter, the industrial bones of their city, grounded the painting in Dagbjort’s world, while the passionate, expressive execution was pure Elias. It was a perfect synthesis. The quiet, serene room was no longer just a haven of order; it was now a space that also held passion, and colour, and a shared story. They stood there for a long time, side by side, looking at the painting they had chosen together. The room was no longer just Dagbjort’s. It was, finally and completely, theirs.They stood in a shared, reverent silence, their work complete. The traffic rumbled on the street below, the refrigerator hummed its low, steady note, but in the living room, the world had been rearranged around a single, vibrant square of colour. The painting was more than an object on a wall; it was a testament, a physical manifestation of the bridge they had built between their two worlds. It held the structural integrity that Dagbjort revered and the wild, emotional truth that Elias chased. It was both a landscape and a feeling, a thing of beauty and a job well done.

Elias was the first to speak, his voice a low murmur that seemed careful not to disturb the new equilibrium of the room. "It’s a perfect join," he said, the words borrowed from Dagbjort's own lexicon, now imbued with a new, shared meaning. "It connects the wall, the room, and us. The flow of energy is… unimpeded." He turned his head to look at Dagbjort, his eyes shining with a light that had nothing to do with the overhead fixture. "You hung it so perfectly. The science of it. It’s not just on the wall, it’s part of the wall. It’s proper."

A warmth spread through Dagbjort’s chest, a profound sense of rightness that went far beyond the satisfaction of a spirit level showing a perfect bubble. He had spent his life making things work, ensuring currents ran safely, and lights came on. But this, this collaborative act of making something beautiful, felt like the most essential work he had ever done. "Just wanted to make sure it wouldn't fall down," he said, the humble, practical words a deflection from the scale of his own emotion. He looked from the fierce orange of the painted sky to Elias’s smiling face. "It makes the room feel… finished. Like this was the last connection it was waiting for."

As he spoke, his gaze drifted from the magnificent new painting to the opposite corner of the room, where The Beast stood in its gilded, cherubic horror. In the clean, afternoon light, its ugliness was almost magnificent. The contrast between the two pieces of decor was comical, a conversation between the sublime and the utterly, hopelessly ridiculous. A year ago, the proximity of the two would have filled him with a deep, shuddering anxiety. Now, he just felt a swell of quiet, amused affection. The hideous lamp was the story of how they had started, a monument to a catastrophic but loving failure of judgment. The beautiful painting was the story of what they had become.

He found himself smiling, a genuine, unforced grin. "It makes The Beast look even more terrible, doesn't it?" he said, the words carrying no malice, only a deep fondness. Elias followed his gaze and let out a real, uninhibited laugh that echoed in the quiet room. "Oh, magnificently so! They’re the thesis and the antithesis. One is a soulful, intelligent examination of our industrial heritage. The other is a gilded python wrestling three fat babies. My entire aesthetic legacy in one room. It’s perfect." He stepped closer to Dagbjort, their shoulders brushing, and they stood together, a silent, appreciative audience for the strange gallery they had curated.

In the weeks that followed, the painting settled into the flat, becoming as much a part of the home as the smell of tea and the sound of the evening news. Dagbjort found it changed the rhythm of his days. He would come home from a long, grimy job, drop his keys in the bowl by the door, and his first glance would be into the living room, to the impossible blaze of orange and violet on his wall. It was a jolt of pure energy, a reminder of a windswept afternoon in Ouseburn, of choosing something beautiful together. It was a constant, silent presence that spoke of Elias, of art, of a world that had once seemed foreign and was now the very fabric of his own happiness.

One evening, as rain lashed against the windows, they sat on the sofa, the painting glowing in the warm, indirect light from a simple uplighter. Elias was reading, and Dagbjort was simply watching the rain smear the city lights into Impressionist blurs. The feeling of home was absolute, a palpable presence in the air. The back-and-forth between their two flats, once a rhythm of their relationship, had started to feel like a needless complication, a circuit with an unnecessary break in it. Dagbjort looked around his serene, ordered living room, now anchored by a piece of shared, passionate art. He looked at Elias, so completely at ease on the sofa, a book resting on his chest. It was the most natural, logical thought in the world.

He cleared his throat, the sound loud in the quiet room. Elias looked up from his book, his eyebrows raised in a silent question. "This is getting a bit daft, isn't it?" Dagbjort began, his voice a little rougher than he’d intended. "You, living there. Me, living here. All your books are there, but your favourite mug is here. My toolbox is here, but half my jumpers end up at yours. The logistics are a mess." He was framing it in the most practical terms he could find, the language of efficiency and common sense, because the emotional truth of what he was about to say was too vast to articulate. "I was just thinking… it might be more efficient if we consolidated. If you… moved in. Here."

Elias’s face, in the soft light, was a study. The surprise, the dawning understanding, and then, a smile of such radiant, unadulterated joy that it eclipsed even the vibrant sunset in their painting. He put his book down, carefully marking his page. He didn’t say anything for a moment, just looked at Dagbjort, his eyes full of a profound, happy certainty. "Dagbjort," he said finally, his voice thick with emotion. "Are you asking me to move in with you because the logistics are a mess?" Dagbjort felt a blush creep up his neck. "Well… yeah. It’s inefficient." Elias laughed, a sound of pure delight. "Of course it is. And yes. A thousand times, yes." He moved across the sofa and kissed him, a kiss that tasted of contentment and the promise of a shared future. "But," Elias added, pulling back with a mischievous glint in his eye, "if I move in, the BIBLIOTEK MAXIMUS comes with me. We'll have to take it apart and rebuild it. It'll be a huge job." Dagbjort looked at the man he loved, at the prospect of another impossible, wonderful, collaborative project, and he grinned. "Easy," he said. "It's just putting the bits together in the right order."The decision to consolidate, once spoken aloud, acquired an unstoppable momentum. The following weekend was designated for what Elias dramatically termed ‘The Great Migration’. Dagbjort arrived at the Jesmond flat with his van, a roll of packing tape, and a battle plan mapped out with the precision of a military campaign. He found Elias sitting on the floor, surrounded by a sea of books, not packing, but reading. He was holding a slim, worn volume, a look of wistful nostalgia on his face. This, Dagbjort realised, was going to be the primary challenge. He was here to move objects; Elias was constitutionally incapable of seeing them as anything other than vessels of memory, each one demanding a moment of quiet contemplation before it could be committed to the cardboard tomb of a packing box.

The process was an archaeological dig into Elias’s past, with Dagbjort acting as the practical site foreman and Elias as the emotional, deeply distractible archaeologist. Every object unearthed a story. A chipped earthenware mug prompted a ten-minute anecdote about a disastrous pottery class in his university days. A bundle of old postcards led to a meandering lecture on the lost art of letter-writing and the semiotics of stamp placement. Dagbjort, ever the pragmatist, developed a system. He would listen patiently to the story, nod with genuine interest, and then, the moment Elias paused for breath, he would swiftly wrap the object in newspaper and entomb it in a box, which he would then immediately seal and label with a thick marker pen. It was the only way to make progress.

The most daunting task, as predicted, was the deconstruction of the BIBLIOTEK MAXIMUS. Taking it apart felt like a form of sacrilege. As Dagbjort expertly used his power drill to release the cam-locks, Elias hovered nearby, looking on with the mournful anxiety of a priest watching his cathedral be dismantled. But as the towering structure was reduced to a neat, manageable stack of laminate planks, Elias’s mood shifted. He saw the logic in it, the clean, reversible process. He marvelled at the way Dagbjort organised the myriad screws and dowels into labelled sandwich bags, a small act of foresight that filled Elias with a sense of wonder. This time, as they worked, it was a true collaboration. Elias, now familiar with the components, passed Dagbjort the correct pieces without prompting, his hands moving with a newfound, if hesitant, confidence.

Transporting the contents of Elias's life across the Tyne in Dagbjort’s work van was a strange and wonderful pilgrimage. The vehicle, which usually smelled of cable insulation and metal filings, was now perfumed with the scent of old paper and beeswax polish. A box of fragile porcelain figurines, inherited from Elias’s mother, was wedged securely between a coil of armoured cable and a heavy-duty spirit level. It was a perfect, tangible metaphor for their merged existence: the beautiful and the practical, the poetic and the pragmatic, nestled together, making the journey in a shared space. As they drove over the Tyne Bridge, the structure arching in muscular grace above them, Dagbjort glanced at Elias, who was looking out at the familiar vista with a look of quiet contentment, and felt a rightness so profound it was like a low, steady hum deep in his chest.

Rebuilding the bookshelf in Dagbjort’s living room was the final, transformative act. It took up an entire wall, the wall opposite the vibrant, explosive painting of the gasometers. The moment the final plank was slotted into place, the room was irrevocably changed. The serene, minimalist space was gone forever, replaced by something new. It was a room that now held a vast, imposing structure dedicated to stories, ideas, and history. It was a room that belonged to a scholar. The process of filling the shelves was slower this time, more deliberate. It was a negotiation. A volume of modernist poetry was placed next to a row of Dagbjort’s neatly organised music magazines. A heavy tome on the Dutch Masters found a home on a shelf above a technical manual for industrial lighting systems. Each placement was a small treaty, a quiet agreement that these two worlds could, and would, coexist.

The final item to be placed was the small, silver-framed photograph of Elias’s parents. Elias held it for a moment, his expression thoughtful, and then, instead of placing it amongst the books, he walked across the room and set it on a small side table next to Dagbjort’s armchair. It was a quiet, significant gesture. The difficult past was no longer hidden away on a crowded shelf; it was out in the open, placed gently within the fabric of their shared daily life, its power to wound diminished by the simple, steady light of acceptance. As they stood back to survey their work, the room felt balanced. The passionate energy of the painting on one wall was now held in conversation with the intellectual weight of the bookshelf on the other. It was a space that made sense, a circuit that was finally complete.

That evening, with every box unpacked and every book shelved, they collapsed onto the sofa. The flat was no longer Dagbjort's. It was a hybrid, a wonderful, slightly cluttered, perfectly functioning fusion of their two lives. The air was filled with the scent of their combined belongings. Elias got up and, for the first time in this flat, went to the corner to switch on The Beast. The familiar, murky pink light filled the room, casting its gloomy, decadent glow over the new bookshelf, the vibrant painting, and the two tired, happy men on the sofa. Dagbjort looked at the leering cherubs, at the shimmering plastic crystals, and at the man he loved, who was now, officially, home. The light from the lamp was still objectively awful, but tonight, it felt like a blessing, a ridiculous, rosy benediction on the beautiful, unlikely, and absolutely solid thing they had built together.The rhythm of cohabitation was a quiet, complex music that they learned by ear. Mornings began with the low rumble of the boiler as Dagbjort, always the first to wake, switched on the heating. He would move through the pre-dawn quiet of the flat with a ghost’s footfalls, making tea in the kitchen, the familiar clink of his favourite mug a gentle reveille. He would sit in his armchair, the one with the side table that now held the photo of Elias’s parents, and drink his tea in the growing light, the silent ritual a way of grounding himself before the day’s work began. Elias would emerge an hour later, blinking, his hair a mess, often with a book already in his hand, having fallen asleep mid-sentence. He would find the mug of tea Dagbjort had left for him on the counter, and the sight of it, warm and waiting, was a small, daily miracle that never lost its power.

Their evenings were a study in gentle collision. Dagbjort would return home, smelling of flux and cold air, his body tired from a day of physical labour, his mind seeking the simple, ordered calm of his home. He would find Elias surrounded by a fresh flurry of books and papers, his mind buzzing from a day spent wrestling with abstract ideas and historical narratives. They would meet in the middle, on the sofa. Dagbjort would close his eyes and listen as Elias, pacing the living room, unspooled a complex theory about the patronage networks of Medici Florence. And later, Elias would sit, chin in hand, utterly absorbed, as Dagbjort, with the patient focus of a master craftsman, explained the elegant, immutable logic of a three-phase electrical system. They were each other’s most captivated audience, finding endless fascination in the foreign landscapes of each other’s expertise.

The flat itself had reached a state of happy, dynamic equilibrium. The minimalist serenity was gone, but the chaos was contained. Elias’s books, while still prone to occasional, migratory drift, were largely housed in their grand new home. Dagbjort’s tools remained in their rightful place in the spare room, but now a small, elegant wooden box sat beside them, containing Elias’s collection of fountain pens and rare inks. It was a space that was both a workshop and a library, a sanctuary and a study. It was a home that breathed, that was alive with the evidence of two intertwined lives. It was this evidence that prompted Elias, one Thursday evening, to make a new, terrifying proposition. “This is a proper home now, Dagbjort,” he announced, looking around the room with deep satisfaction. “And a proper home ought to have guests. I was thinking we could have Dr. Alistair Finch from the department over for dinner. His work on late-period Titian is seminal, and he tells the most scandalous anecdotes about the Venice Biennale.”

Dagbjort froze, a piece of toast halfway to his mouth. The thought of making polite conversation with a seminal Titian expert while trying not to spill gravy on his trousers filled him with a cold, visceral dread. He saw a future of awkward silences and incomprehensible academic jokes. He saw his home, his sanctuary, turned into a stage for a performance he didn’t know how to give. But he also saw, with a startling clarity, that this was the next step. If this was to be their home, it had to be a home for all parts of their lives, not just the comfortable, private parts. And if they were going to have guests, they couldn't start with the easy ones. They had to start with the real test. “No,” Dagbjort said, his voice firm. “Not him. Not first.” Elias looked taken aback. “No? Why not? He’s perfectly charming.” Dagbjort took a deep breath. “If we’re going to do this, we’re doing it properly. We’re stress-testing the circuit. We’re having Gaz over.”

The silence that followed was profound. Elias’s face went through several distinct stages: confusion, dawning comprehension, and finally, a look of quiet, noble terror that was almost comical. Gaz. The lump hammer. The man who thought existential dread was something you got when the kebab shop was shut. The prospect was, in its own way, far more daunting than hosting a world-renowned art historian. Dr. Finch might be boring; Gaz could be a category five social disaster. But Elias saw the logic in it. He saw the challenge Dagbjort was setting for them, for their home. It was a test of integration, a final, definitive bridging of their two worlds. He squared his shoulders, a general accepting a near-impossible mission. “Right,” he said, his voice a little tight. “Gaz. Excellent. What, precisely, does one serve a human lump hammer for dinner?”

The preparations for what became known as ‘The Gaz Summit’ were a microcosm of their entire relationship. Elias, treating the challenge as an intellectual problem, had spent an evening researching ‘traditional working-class English cuisine’ as if it were an ancient, forgotten ritual. He had proposed a menu that included a homemade steak and kidney pie with suet pastry, a trifle involving sherry-soaked ladyfingers, and a starter of devilled kidneys on toast. Dagbjort had looked at the ambitious, historically accurate menu, imagined the sheer, unmitigated horror on Gaz’s face at the sight of a devilled kidney, and had gently vetoed the entire plan. “Shepherd’s pie,” he declared, with the finality of a master electrician signing off on a wiring plan. “With cheese on top. And a tin of mushy peas. And there will be no suet. And absolutely no offal. We’re trying to build bridges here, Elias, not burn them down with historical innards.”

The cooking, on the designated Saturday evening, was a chaotic but joyful ballet. Dagbjort, in his element, peeled and chopped potatoes with a rhythmic, efficient precision, his movements clean and economical. Elias, tasked with browning the mince and making the gravy, approached the job with a cook’s terror and a chemist’s precision, measuring out the Worcestershire sauce with a teaspoon and consulting a recipe on his phone with the gravity of a man defusing a bomb. He kept getting distracted, picking up the bottle of Henderson’s Relish and beginning a thoughtful monologue on the socio-economic history of Sheffield and the subtle differences between northern English condiments. Dagbjort would gently take the bottle from his hand, point him back towards the simmering pan, and say, “Just stir it, love. Before it sticks.” The kitchen filled with the warm, comforting smells of onions, gravy, and their easy, collaborative laughter. The shepherd’s pie, when it went into the oven, was a triumph of their combined efforts: perfectly seasoned, structurally sound, and utterly, reassuringly unpretentious.

The doorbell rang at precisely seven o’clock, a sound that made both of their stomachs clench. Dagbjort opened the door to find Gaz standing on the landing, looking profoundly uncomfortable in a clean, ironed shirt. He was holding a four-pack of lager in one hand and a cellophane-wrapped garage forecourt bouquet of carnations in the other. He thrust the flowers vaguely in Dagbjort’s direction. “For the, uh, for the house,” he mumbled, his eyes darting nervously past Dagbjort into the flat, as if expecting to be ambushed by abstract sculpture. Dagbjort took the flowers, touched and amused in equal measure. “Cheers, mate. Come in.” Gaz stepped over the threshold, his steel-toed boots making a heavy, unfamiliar sound on the hallway laminate, and his gaze fell upon the living room. He stopped dead. The vast, book-filled expanse of the BIBLIOTEK MAXIMUS seemed to physically stun him. He stared at it, his mouth slightly agape, like a pilgrim beholding a vast, incomprehensible holy relic. “Bloody hell, Dag,” he whispered, his voice full of awe and terror. “It’s like the library from Beauty and the Beast. Does it… does it have a ladder?”

The initial conversation was as stilted as Dagbjort had feared. They sat in the living room, Gaz perched on the edge of the sofa as if ready to bolt, clutching a can of lager like a life raft. He tried to talk about work, about a tricky consumer unit replacement they had a job on for the next week. Elias, trying to find a way in, asked if the design of modern consumer units reflected a particular aesthetic philosophy. Gaz just stared at him blankly. “They’re just plastic boxes full of switches, mate.” An awkward silence descended, thick and suffocating. Dagbjort, feeling a rising tide of panic, went to check on the pie. The turning point came from the most unexpected of quarters. Gaz, his eyes still roaming the room, spotted the painting of the gasometers. “Hey, I know them,” he said, a flicker of recognition in his eyes. “Used to drive past them every day on the way to my first apprenticeship. Ugly old things, aren’t they?”

“I don’t think they’re ugly,” Elias said, his voice quiet. He got up and stood before the painting, not in a lecturing pose, but as if simply looking at it with a friend. “I think they have a kind of grandeur. Like the ruins of a Roman aqueduct. They’re monuments to a different age. They were built to do a job, a huge, important job, and they did it. There’s a nobility in that.” Gaz looked from the painting to Elias, a flicker of something new in his expression. He understood things that were built to do a job. He understood the nobility of function. “Never thought of it like that,” he admitted, his voice losing its defensive edge. “They are… big.” He then squinted at the violent orange sky. “Sky doesn’t look like that, though.” “No,” Elias agreed with a smile. “It doesn’t. That’s the feeling of it. That’s the art. The artist has shown you how it felt to look at them, not just what they looked like. It’s the difference between a wiring diagram and getting a belt off a live wire. One tells you the facts. The other lets you feel it.”

A slow grin spread across Gaz’s face. He got it. The analogy, crude and slightly alarming, had landed perfectly. He finally relaxed, sinking back into the sofa cushions. The conversation for the rest of the evening flowed, not smoothly, but with a lumpy, companionable grace. They ate the shepherd’s pie, which Gaz declared was “proper grub.” They found common ground in a shared, passionate hatred for a particularly smarmy reality TV star, a discovery that bonded them more effectively than any high-minded cultural discussion. Gaz told a long, rambling, and hilarious story about getting his van stuck in the mud on a remote farm job, and Elias listened with the rapt attention of someone hearing a great epic poem, occasionally interjecting with questions about soil composition and torque. By the end of the night, Gaz was laughing, his awkwardness completely forgotten. He looked at Elias, then at Dagbjort, a new, baffled respect in his eyes. “You’re alright, you are,” he said to Elias, gesturing with his empty beer can. “Bit weird, like. But you’re alright.”

When Gaz had finally been bundled out of the door, full of pie and a grudging admiration, Dagbjort and Elias were left in the warm, comfortable wreckage of their first dinner party. The air smelled of gravy and beer. Dirty plates were stacked on the coffee table. It was a mess, but it was a happy, lived-in mess. Dagbjort leaned against the door, feeling a wave of relief so profound it left him weak. “Well,” he said, a huge, tired smile on his face. “We survived.” Elias came and stood in front of him, wrapping his arms around his waist. He looked exhausted, but his eyes were bright with triumph. “We did more than survive, Dagbjort,” he said softly. “We hosted. In our home.” He rested his forehead against Dagbjort’s, the scent of their shared evening clinging to them both. “Your friend is right. I am a bit weird. But he’s right about the pie, too. It was proper.” They stood there for a long moment, simply holding each other in their messy, beautiful, perfectly integrated living room. The circuit was not just complete; it had been tested under a full load, and it had held, stronger and brighter than ever.
