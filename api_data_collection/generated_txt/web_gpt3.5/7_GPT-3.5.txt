the heart of the challenge mateos grip on his machete tightened well face it together they stepped into the passage the air heavy with a sense of anticipation the walls seemed to close in around them as if the very stone was alive and shifting the passage twisted and turned leading them deeper into the ruins until they arrived in a chamber unlike any they had seen before the chamber was a
