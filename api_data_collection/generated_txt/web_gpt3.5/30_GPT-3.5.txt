engravings etched into the walls depicting scenes of trials and tribulations that others had faced on their journeys eamon traced his fingers over the images his gaze focused on the stories told in the stone these carvings seem to depict the challenges that lie ahead he mused selene nodded her eyes scanning the engravings with a thoughtful expression indeed the canyon serves as a test of loyalty
