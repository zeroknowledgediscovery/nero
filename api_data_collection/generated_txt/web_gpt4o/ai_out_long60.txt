Chapter One: Dust Rising

The sun cracked open the Texas sky like a furnace lid, heat shimmering over the endless stretch of rust-colored plain. Beyond the town of Garza Ridge, where the land forgot how to bend and trees dared not grow too tall, a single engine pickup coughed its way down a dirt road, trailing a cloud of grit and memory.

Cole Maddox sat behind the wheel, a Marlboro clamped in his teeth, flame licking up from a dented Zippo as he lit it. The ashtray overflowed. Country music on the radio crackled between static and heartache. Behind him, strapped under tarp and rope, was a steel case—long, black, and heavy enough to have its own story. He didn’t look back at it. Didn’t have to. He knew what was in there.

Garza Ridge hadn’t changed. That was the first thing he noticed. The feed store still leaned like it was drunk on moonshine, the diner still had its “Open 7 Days” sign half-lit, and Sheriff Buckley's office had the same cracked steps leading to the front porch, where a mutt named Greeley lay sleeping like he owned the place.

Cole rolled down his window as he passed through town, tipped his hat at no one in particular, and turned west where the gravel grew coarser. He wasn’t back for a reunion. He was back because someone had called him in the middle of the night and said one word before the line went dead: “June.”

She’d been dead eight years.

He remembered her laugh—like wind chimes caught in a storm—and her eyes that always looked like they were seeing something two seconds before everyone else. She’d drowned in Redman Lake, or so they said. Her car found wrapped around a cottonwood, keys still in the ignition, a trail of footprints ending at the waterline.

Only they’d never found her body.

Cole pulled up to the edge of the Maddox ranch, a skeletal remnant of better days. The barn roof was caved in on the east side, and buzzards circled lazily above the northern paddock where nothing had grazed in years. He stepped out, boots crunching dirt, and took a long look. The wind had a way of whispering here—sounded like her voice sometimes.

“Cole.”

He turned. Sheriff Buckley stood by a squad car, his thumbs looped through his belt. Still wore that faded Stetson, still looked like he hadn’t smiled since the Nixon years.

“Figured I’d see you,” Buckley said.

Cole nodded. “Did you make the call?”

Buckley didn’t answer right away. He looked past Cole, at the truck. “Nope. Thought it mighta been you playin’ some game.”

Cole shook his head. “I got the call same as you.”

That put a wrinkle in Buckley’s already creased brow. “What’d they say?”

“One word. Her name.”

“June.”

Silence hung between them, thick as the heat.

“I’m guessin’ you didn’t come back just to ask questions.”

“I came back to bury something,” Cole said, glancing at the steel case. “And maybe dig something else up.”

Inside the ranch house, the air was stale with memory. Cole walked through it like a man wading through ghosts. Photos still hung on the walls—his dad with his rifle, his mom in a Sunday dress, and June, framed by a crooked smile, standing beside Cole in front of a bonfire that burned thirty feet high.

He poured himself a drink. Whiskey. The bottle hadn’t moved since the funeral.

That night, sleep didn’t come. Around two a.m., he heard the knock. Slow. Deliberate. Three taps.

He opened the door, and there was no one there. Just wind and dust.

Then he looked down.

A Polaroid lay on the doormat. It was a picture of June. But not old. Not faded. She was older. Today older. Her hair cut different. A scar on her cheek that hadn’t been there before. And behind her, something that made his blood chill: the old well near the Tarry Creek bend. The one they’d sealed up in ‘96.

Cole pocketed the photo and went back inside. Poured another glass. This time it trembled in his hand.

Chapter Two: Blood in the Well

The next morning, Cole drove to Tarry Creek. He hadn’t been out that way in a decade. The bridge was half-rotted, the creek little more than a trickle now, but the well was still there. A rusted ring of stones hidden under thorn brush, covered in dead vines and whispers.

He parked, checked the case in the back again, then stepped into the brush. The air grew cooler the closer he got, like the well pulled heat out of the ground itself.

Something shimmered in the shadows.

“June?” he called, voice catching on the silence.

Then he saw it—bootprints. Fresh. Smaller than his.

A voice behind him: “You’re not supposed to be here.”

He turned.

A girl—sixteen maybe, with dark eyes and a familiar crooked smile—stood on the edge of the brush, arms crossed. “My mom told me if anyone came lookin’ for the well, I should tell ‘em to leave.”

“Your mom?”

She nodded.

“What’s her name?”

The girl hesitated, then said, “June.”

Cole’s stomach twisted. “Where is she?”

The girl pointed down. At the well.

“She’s waitin’.”

Cole stepped forward, brush snapping underfoot. The girl didn’t stop him.

He dropped to one knee, cleared away the vines, and peered down.

Darkness.

Then a voice echoed up, thin as mist: “Cole…”

His heart stopped.

Later that night, Cole sat on the back porch of the ranch house, polishing the old revolver that had belonged to his grandfather. The steel case lay open beside him. Inside was a rifle, custom-made, with etchings on the barrel in Spanish: “Para los que no mueren” — For those who do not die.

He remembered the first time he heard the legend. He’d been ten. His uncle Tom drunk on mescal, telling ghost stories about the well at Tarry Creek. How something crawled out of it every twenty years. How it took a piece of whoever listened.

He thought they were stories.

He didn’t think they’d take June.

Buckley showed up again the next day. “There’s been… incidents,” he said. “Animals turned up gutted. Two drifters found torn open outside county lines. You know anything about that?”

“No,” Cole said. “But I’m about to.”

“What’s in the case?”

“Insurance.”

Buckley nodded like he understood, but Cole could see the fear behind his eyes. This wasn’t law and order stuff. This was old. Older than the town. Older than maps.

“What do you plan to do?”

“Bring her back.”

“Or bury her for good.”

Chapter Three: The Hollow Ones

Garza Ridge started feeling strange by the fourth day. Power flickered. Radios buzzed with voices that shouldn’t be there. People saw things in mirrors they didn’t recognize. And the little girl—the one who said her mother was June—vanished without a trace. Her trailer left open. Breakfast half-cooked on the stove. Her name was Clara.

Cole found a note in her room, written in shaky, uneven print.

“They're not asleep anymore.”

He went back to the well that night. Brought the rifle. He could feel something watching. Not eyes. Not exactly. But a pressure, like memory turned inside out. A figure stood at the edge of the woods. Pale. Thin. Almost human. But not.

“Who are you?” Cole demanded.

The figure didn’t answer. Just pointed at the well, then vanished.

Back at the house, the Polaroid had changed. Now June’s eyes were bleeding. And her mouth was stitched shut.

Cole lit a match and burned it. It screamed.

The next day, he found Clara’s necklace on the porch swing. It was wet. Not with water.

He knew he couldn’t do it alone. He drove east, to Houston, where a man named Elias Varn kept to himself in a warehouse full of relics and banned books. Elias owed him a favor.

“What you’re dealing with,” Elias said, pulling open a book bound in leather that didn’t smell like animal, “isn’t just some curse. It’s a fracture. A place where the world split wrong. The well is older than time, Cole. You don’t close something like that. You bargain with it. Or you feed it.”

Cole didn’t like either of those options.

Elias shrugged. “You asked for truth, not comfort.”

They loaded up. Spells. Salt. Blood markers. A hound that could smell the dead and hadn’t barked in twelve years.

They returned to Garza Ridge. The wind smelled wrong.

“Tell me something,” Elias said as they passed the county line. “If she’s really down there… do you plan to bring her back?”

Cole didn’t answer.

Not yet.

Buckley lingered longer than he needed to, his hand resting on the butt of his holster like he thought trouble might spring out of the dirt. Cole didn’t blame him. The land out here held secrets like tree bark held old nails—hard to see, but always waiting to cut. The sheriff’s eyes kept flicking to the truck bed, to the steel case that sat there mute and heavy, like it knew its own purpose. Cole could feel the questions building behind Buckley’s leathery face, but none came.

Instead, Buckley shifted, spat a brown stream into the dust, and said, “You sure you’re up for this? Ain’t been back ten years, and now you come ridin’ in like the past didn’t leave scars.”

Cole didn’t look at him. He stared out over the paddock, where the weeds had taken back what the horses once trampled. “I’m not here for the past,” he said. “I’m here for what’s left.”

The sheriff gave a short grunt, half amusement, half warning. “Just be careful, son. Dead things don’t always stay buried around here. And sometimes, they’re the lucky ones.”

With that, Buckley turned and walked back to his cruiser, the engine groaning to life before he drove off in a cloud of white dust. Cole watched him disappear down the road, then turned toward the house, the boards creaking beneath his boots like old bones shifting under a shallow grave. The wind had picked up again, hissing through the broken slats of the porch like something whispering its last rites.

Inside, the place smelled of rot and rust. His mother’s rocking chair still faced the window, though it was covered in dust thick enough to write a confession. The couch had collapsed in the center, and what had once been a proud rifle rack on the mantle now held only dust and one empty hook. The photographs on the wall tilted at angles that suggested they’d been disturbed by something more than time. He ran his fingers over the face of one—June and him on the Fourth of July, her grin wide and effortless, him trying not to squint into the flash. That picture shouldn’t have been here. He was sure he’d packed it with his things before he left.

Something thumped upstairs.

He froze.

The sound came again—light, quick, almost like footsteps.

He grabbed the crowbar leaning beside the fireplace and moved toward the staircase, every step creaking betrayal beneath his feet. The second floor had always been claustrophobic, with low ceilings and narrow hallways where light barely reached. At the far end, the door to his old bedroom stood ajar. The smell was different here—not just dust and decay but something sweeter, like wet lilacs left too long in the vase.

He nudged the door open with the crowbar and stepped inside.

Nothing moved. The bed was made, which was strange enough—he hadn’t done that since he was a kid. A red ribbon lay on the pillow, knotted in the middle, frayed at both ends. He hadn’t seen one like it since the summer June turned seventeen. She used to tie them into her hair when they’d go down to the lake.

Cole reached out to touch it, but just before his fingers met the fabric, the overhead light flickered once, then went out completely.

He stood in the dark, not breathing.

Somewhere behind him, wood groaned. Not from pressure. From weight. Like something had just stepped onto the floorboards.

He turned fast, crowbar up, heart punching through his ribs. But there was nothing there.

He didn’t sleep that night. Instead, he brought the steel case inside, set it down in the center of the living room, and pulled out a key from around his neck. The lock snapped open with a dry click. Inside lay a rifle, long and sleek, etched with patterns like winding vines and dying stars. He ran a cloth over the barrel and checked the chamber—loaded, safety off.

In the bottom of the case was a notebook wrapped in oilcloth. He hadn’t opened it in years. The leather was cracked, the pages yellowed, and the ink faded in places. It was June’s journal. Or what was left of it.

He flipped through the entries. Most were simple, teenage musings about town gossip, music, and dreams she had—literal ones. June always dreamed strange. One line stopped him cold.

“The man with no face was at the lake again. I think he’s waiting for something. Or someone.”

Cole had seen that name before. In one of his own dreams. A man whose face blurred like heat off asphalt. Always watching. Never moving.

He kept reading.

“If I disappear, don’t look in the water. Don’t follow the music. And whatever you do, don’t go near the well after dark. I think it opens.”

The ink at the end of that line was smudged. Like it had been written in a hurry. Or through tears.

He snapped the journal shut and stood. There was more here than memory. Something lived in this house, or maybe in the land itself. And if June was still alive—or whatever version of her had called him home—it had something to do with that cursed stretch of earth out past Tarry Creek. He’d buried the truth once, with whiskey and distance. But the ground had shifted, and now the bones were starting to rise.

The next day, he returned to town.

People stared. Garza Ridge wasn’t a place where folks forgot easily, and Cole had left under a shadow. Some thought he’d run from grief. Others thought he’d gone crazy. Maybe both were true.

At the diner, Luanne barely looked up when he sat at the counter. Her hair was gray now, tied back in the same bun she’d worn when he was in high school.

“Well, look what the dog dragged back,” she said, pouring him a coffee without asking.

“Still strong as hell,” Cole said, taking a sip and wincing. “Just how I like it.”

“You don’t like anything,” she said, but there was no heat behind it.

“I’m lookin’ for someone.”

“Town’s not that big.”

He pulled out the Polaroid. Laid it gently on the counter.

Luanne stared at it a long time. “That’s not possible,” she said softly.

“You recognize her?”

Her eyes flicked to him. “You know damn well I do.”

“She’s older now. Scar on her cheek. You seen anyone like that?”

“No,” Luanne said, picking up the photo and turning it facedown. “And if I had, I wouldn’t tell you. Not because I don’t trust you, Cole. But because some doors shouldn’t be opened twice.”

Cole nodded slowly. “That well—people used to talk about it. Old stories, warnings. I never believed them. You?”

Luanne looked at him, her lips thinning. “Doesn’t matter what I believe. The ground out there’s wrong. Always has been. You ever wonder why your daddy fenced off that corner of the ranch, told you never to step foot near it?”

“I thought it was just old septic.”

“It’s older than that. And deeper.”

Cole finished his coffee and stood. “Thanks for the cup.”

“Careful out there,” she said. “The dead got long arms around here.”

He stepped outside into the sun, the photo burning a hole in his pocket. There was only one place left to go now—the library.

Garza Ridge’s library was a one-room shack of a place, kept alive by the stubbornness of old man Richter. When Cole stepped through the door, the air smelled of dust and foxglove. The librarian looked up from a stack of county records, thick lenses magnifying his eyes like a barn owl.

“Cole Maddox. Back from the wastelands.”

“Still as poetic as ever,” Cole said. “I’m looking for something. History of the town. Strange events. Disappearances.”

“You mean the ones we don’t talk about.”

“Those are the ones I’m interested in.”

Richter nodded and disappeared into the back. When he returned, he laid down a stack of file folders bound with twine.

“You want stories, you’ll find ‘em here. But don’t expect sense. A lot of what’s written down was copied from journals, church notes, oral accounts. Folklore, mostly. But some of it lines up too neatly for comfort.”

Cole opened the first folder and started to read.

It didn’t take long for the pieces to form a shape. The well had been there long before the town. Before the Spanish. Before the tribes. Carved from stone not found in the region. Locals believed it was a crossing—a place where something came through every few generations, leaving behind silence, sickness, and sorrow.

And always, always, someone vanished.

He found June’s name in a 2017 record. Marked missing, presumed drowned. But the body never turned up.

Beneath the line, someone had scribbled in red pen: “She walked away. Saw it with my own eyes. But she wasn’t the same.”

Cole sat back in the wooden chair, heart thumping in his ears.

He wasn’t chasing a ghost. He was chasing something that came back wearing the skin of a girl he once loved.

And it was calling him closer.

Chapter Two: The Girl in the Rivergrass

By morning, the sun rose on Garza Ridge like an accusation, its heat less a comfort and more a test of resolve. Cole didn’t sleep, not really. Just dozed with his back against the old living room wall, the rifle by his side and the steel case open on the floor. The house was quieter in the daylight, but it was an unnatural quiet, like something holding its breath. He didn’t need long to decide what to do next. The library records had said the well marked the start of it, but the lake was where June had ended—or at least, where the official story placed her. That made it the next step, or maybe the next trap.

Redman Lake sat in a natural depression south of the ridge, ringed by scraggly trees and rivergrass that swayed even when the air was still. It had been a place of summer joy once—bonfires, skinny-dipping, laughter echoing off the water like a promise. But after June disappeared, it turned sour. People stopped coming. The dock collapsed from neglect. Rumors started. Something about the water. Something about shapes that moved beneath it when the moon was low.

Cole parked his truck near the treeline and walked down the trail, the rifle slung over his shoulder, boots crunching the dry grass. The lake shimmered through the trees like a silver wound. The closer he got, the more the air thickened. It didn’t feel right. The smell was all wrong too—earth and algae, yes, but under it something almost sweet, like decay hiding in perfume.

At the shore, he saw her.

Not June. A girl. Young, maybe fifteen, standing knee-deep in the water, her hair slicked back, eyes vacant. She wore a simple white dress, soaked and clinging to her like a second skin. She didn’t move when he approached. Didn’t even blink.

“Hey,” Cole called, stopping a few feet from the waterline. “You alright?”

The girl tilted her head slowly, unnaturally, like a puppet whose strings had tangled.

“My name’s Clara,” she said.

Cole’s breath caught. That was the name the girl from the trailer had given. The one who claimed June was her mother.

“You remember me?”

“You were at the well,” she said, and her voice wasn’t flat. It was layered, like someone else was speaking just beneath her words. “She’s waiting. She doesn’t like waiting.”

He stepped closer. The water around her feet didn’t ripple. It held her like glass.

“Where is June?” he asked.

“She’s coming. But not like before. She’s… more now. The place makes her more.”

Cole lowered the rifle slightly. “Are you in danger?”

Clara smiled. It was a strange expression. Half sorrow, half joy. “We all are.”

And then she was gone.

Not vanished, not disappeared like a trick. One blink and the lake was empty again, the surface still as a mirror. Cole scanned the treeline, the shore, the water. Nothing. Not even footprints where she’d stood. His skin crawled. This wasn’t just memory playing tricks. Something had bent the rules of what was real.

He stayed by the lake another hour, hoping for another sign, another clue. Instead, he found a charm necklace tangled in the reeds. It was old, tarnished silver, with the letter J engraved in the center. June had one just like it when they were kids.

He pocketed it and left, the wind sighing through the trees like it was saying goodbye.

Back at the ranch, he tried to collect himself, but the house didn’t make it easy. The air inside had turned thick, oppressive. Walls seemed closer. The shadows deeper. He opened the fridge out of habit and found nothing but a note, written in black ink on the back of a grocery list. He didn’t remember writing it. Didn’t remember ever seeing it.

“You shouldn’t have come back.”

That night, the dreams returned. Not the old kind, where memories curled around grief and nostalgia. These were colder. More precise. June stood by the well, her back to him, her hands wrapped in something like barbed wire, her mouth sewn shut with threads of shadow. She turned, and where her eyes should’ve been, there were small, writhing things—leeches, maybe, or roots. She opened her mouth despite the stitches, and her voice cracked like breaking glass.

“Help me.”

He woke with blood on his pillow. Not his. It smelled like iron and salt and something older than either.

He called Buckley the next morning.

“Meet me,” he said. “You need to see something.”

The sheriff didn’t argue. They met at the lake, just before noon. Buckley stood with arms crossed, his badge tarnished, eyes skeptical.

“You look like hell.”

“I feel like it.”

“What are we lookin’ for?”

Cole led him to the spot where Clara had stood. There was nothing there now, of course. But the reeds were crushed in a circle, and Buckley knelt beside the necklace Cole had returned to mark the place.

“This June’s?” he asked.

“Yeah.”

Buckley rubbed the back of his neck. “You think someone’s playin’ games? Could be sick kids, pranksters…”

“I don’t think kids do what’s happening in my house. I don’t think they leave notes I don’t write and appear in dreams that aren’t dreams.”

Buckley looked away, toward the water. “You ever hear of the Hollow Ones?”

Cole frowned. “No.”

“It’s a local myth,” Buckley said. “Old. Older than the county. Stories go back to the Spanish missions, maybe even before that. Something about people who get taken by the land. Not killed. Changed. Hollowed out. They look like us. Talk like us. But they ain’t us anymore.”

Cole stared at him. “You believe that?”

Buckley hesitated, then nodded. “I saw my brother walk back into town two days after his funeral. We buried him. I saw the body. But he showed up like he’d just gone out for milk. My mother screamed herself hoarse. He stayed the night, sat at the kitchen table, just… smiled. And in the morning, he was gone again. Left the door open behind him. There wasn’t a footprint to be found.”

“Jesus.”

Buckley looked tired. “I never told anyone. Figured it was grief. Or whiskey. But I remember his eyes. They were wrong. Like glass with nothin’ behind it.”

Cole thought of Clara. Of June. Of the dream.

“I think whatever’s in the well,” he said, “it’s not just a thing. It’s a door.”

Buckley shook his head slowly. “No, son. It’s worse. It’s an invitation.”

They left the lake in silence, each man turning over ghosts of his own. Cole knew now that something had been seeded in Garza Ridge long before either of them were born. And now, it was starting to bloom.

That night, the wind carried voices again.

Cole lit every oil lamp in the house, circled it with salt, and loaded both weapons. He read from June’s journal until the handwriting turned shaky and the words stopped making sense.

“They told me things. They told me about the sky behind the sky. They said my name is theirs now. That I’m not allowed to leave until someone takes my place.”

He tried to sleep but failed.

Just after midnight, the lights blew out at once. A slow knock started at the front door. Three measured taps.

He didn’t answer.

Then it came from the back.

Then the window.

Every side of the house, someone knocking. Not loud. Not violent. Just persistent.

He gripped the rifle tighter, breath shallow.

Then a voice, clear and gentle, whispered through the floorboards:

“Let me in, Cole. You said you’d never leave me behind.”

Cole didn’t move, didn’t breathe. The voice seemed to come from everywhere at once, seeping through the walls like rising mold. It was her voice—June’s—but wrong somehow. As if someone had learned it by listening too closely, like a mockingbird that remembered how she used to sound but forgot where the soul went. The knocks stopped. The silence that followed was heavier than any noise could’ve been.

He paced the room once, twice, then turned off every lamp, every flickering candle. Darkness was better now—truth felt clearer inside it. From the closet, he retrieved a small, dust-covered box and placed it carefully on the kitchen table. Inside, folded and yellowing, were maps of the Maddox land, old ones from the 1800s, drawn by hand when his great-great-grandfather homesteaded the place after the war. His family had always stayed on the north side, near the ridge, and he’d never thought about why. Until now.

The oldest map had a faint marking in the southern quarter, barely more than a penciled ring: "La Cuna." The cradle. That was what the Spanish missionaries called it. Cole traced the edge of the circle with his finger. That was where the well stood now. It hadn’t been placed there by accident.

He spent the rest of the night planning. At dawn, he loaded the steel case into the truck, locked the rifle across the passenger seat, and scribbled a note for Buckley just in case he didn’t come back.

By the time he reached the well, the air was already thick with heat. Buzzards wheeled overhead. The grass lay flat, pressed as if by wind that had since moved on. Cole knelt beside the ring of stones, brushing aside dirt and roots to uncover the original stones beneath—smooth, etched with symbols that made no cultural sense. Not tribal. Not Christian. Not anything human.

He lowered a small metal recorder down into the dark, letting it dangle on a rope. When he played it back, he expected silence, maybe the creak of the rope. What he got was a chorus of whispers, overlapping and inverted. Then a single voice broke through the murk.

“We never left. We just needed you to remember.”

He staggered back and almost dropped the device.

That night, he went to the one person he thought might know more than anyone else—Elias Varn.

Elias lived on the edge of Houston in a warehouse that once stored oranges and now stored secrets. The man was tall, thin as wire, and always wore gloves, even in summer. He didn’t ask why Cole was there. Just opened the door and waved him in.

“You finally found her,” Elias said.

“I don’t know what I’ve found.”

“Oh, you do. You just don’t like the shape of it.”

Inside, the place was a maze of cabinets, hanging lamps, and stacks of books written in languages no one had spoken for centuries. In the back, Elias had cleared a circle in chalk. Around it, talismans. Dried herbs. Silver needles. Symbols etched into wax.

Cole laid June’s journal on the table beside the old maps.

“She wrote about a man with no face. About hearing voices near the well. About being watched in her dreams.”

“She was being prepared,” Elias said. “The place chose her. Maybe it smelled the grief. Or maybe it knew her blood. You said your mother was from this land?”

Cole nodded. “The Maddoxes have been here since before the county lines.”

“That’s not what I asked.”

Cole tensed. “Yeah. Her people were here. Creek Nation.”

Elias sighed. “That’s the root, then. This isn’t a haunting. It’s a tether. The well wasn’t built. It was uncovered. Long before the missionaries. Maybe before language. It’s a place where the skin between worlds is thin. And it’s hungry.”

Cole rubbed his temples. “I need to bring her back.”

“You might not like what you drag up.”

“I don’t care.”

Elias pulled a small black cloth from his shelf and unfolded it. Inside were tiny bones—bird, maybe—and a single polished stone that shimmered even in the dim light.

“This will help you speak. Not with her. With it.”

Cole hesitated, then took it.

“You need a guide,” Elias continued. “A living one. Someone who’s been touched but not taken.”

“Clara.”

Elias raised an eyebrow. “She’s not entirely hers anymore. But if there’s anyone left inside, she’ll lead you to the threshold.”

“Then I’m going back tonight.”

“You’ll need more than salt and prayers. You’ll need to bleed. Just enough to open the gate.”

Cole found Clara again near the water tower just before dusk. She stood alone, staring up at the metal skeleton of the town’s thirst, her hair drifting in the breeze like it didn’t weigh her down anymore. When she turned, her eyes were tired.

“You came back,” she said, almost surprised.

“I need your help.”

She nodded like she’d been expecting it.

“I can’t get close without you,” Cole said.

“She doesn’t like being followed,” Clara murmured. “But she’ll come if I ask.”

They drove together, the truck rattling over dead roots and broken trail. Clara sat quiet, hands folded in her lap, her gaze fixed on the horizon where the land darkened. She didn’t flinch when the trees started to shift in unnatural ways—trunks leaning where they hadn’t leaned before, shadows curling toward the road like fingers.

By the time they reached the well, the moon had risen—a pale coin behind thick clouds.

Clara stepped out first.

“She’s here,” she whispered.

The wind stopped.

Cole unloaded the rifle, the charm stone Elias had given him, and the notebook. He cut his palm with a hunting knife and let three drops fall onto the dirt inside the stone circle. The earth absorbed it like it had been waiting.

Clara stepped into the ring. The air shimmered.

Then a shape rose from the well—not crawling, not climbing. Rising. As if carried by something below.

It was June.

But her feet didn’t touch the ground. Her hair floated like she was still underwater. Her eyes… they weren’t hollow. They weren’t even human. They were full of stars, black and endless.

“Cole,” she said, and this time it was her. The real her. Not twisted. Not lost.

He stepped forward. “I came back.”

“I didn’t want you to,” she said softly. “I tried to keep you away.”

“I saw the picture. I saw Clara.”

“She’s not mine,” June said, and her voice broke. “She’s what they left in place of me.”

Cole turned to Clara. The girl didn’t speak. Her expression cracked slowly, like ice splitting on a lake. And then she was smiling—too wide, too knowing.

“I only needed you to open the door,” she said.

Then everything went black.

When Cole opened his eyes, the world had changed. The sky above him wasn’t the one he’d grown under. It was red, and wrong, and endless.

The well was gone.

So was June.

Clara stood at the edge of what looked like a field of bones, and something moved just beneath the soil. She looked down at him, and her voice was ancient.

“Welcome to the Hollow.”

Chapter Three: The Hollow Beneath

Cole wasn’t sure how long he’d been lying on the ground. Time here didn’t move right—it pulsed, like a wound that never closed. The sky above was a deep, boiling crimson, streaked with clouds that twisted like vines strangling an unseen sun. The air tasted bitter, dry, and electric. When he sat up, the world around him tilted slightly, like he was standing on a giant’s knuckle.

He tried to orient himself. The well was gone—vanished without a trace. No ring of stone, no vine-choked ruins. In its place was a flat plain stretching endlessly, cracked like baked earth, except it pulsed underfoot. Not like ground, but like something alive. Something breathing.

Behind him, Clara—if that’s what she still was—stood perfectly still, watching with eyes that no longer blinked. Her smile remained carved into her face, neither joyful nor cruel, just there, as if smiling was the only expression this place allowed.

“What is this?” Cole asked, rising to his feet, the rifle still slung across his back.

She tilted her head. “The Hollow. Where the echo of every broken thing comes to rest.”

Her voice carried a strange distortion now, like it overlapped with others—older, deeper voices layered beneath the surface of her own. Her feet hovered just an inch above the ground, toes never quite touching, like the laws of this place didn’t entirely apply to her.

“You said she was here,” he said. “June.”

“She was,” Clara answered. “And she is. But not in the way you want.”

Cole clenched his fists, the pain from his cut palm now a dull throb. “Bring her to me.”

“She’s already with you,” Clara said, and gestured at the sky. “She watches. She waits. And if you listen closely, she speaks.”

He didn’t want riddles. He wanted answers. He turned and began to walk, choosing a direction at random because there was no horizon here—only endless desolation, interrupted by things that looked like trees but shifted when he wasn’t watching.

Clara followed. Not walking. Just moving. Every time he glanced back, she was there, closer than he expected.

Hours—or maybe days—passed like that. The red sky never changed. The heat never lifted. He saw things along the path: bones shaped like chairs, a rusted swing set growing out of stone, a telephone pole upside down and half-buried. Echoes of the real world, dragged here and abandoned like memories gone sour.

At one point, they came upon a house.

It was his house—the Maddox ranch—but twisted, the angles wrong, the windows black and bleeding smoke. He stepped toward it instinctively, but Clara held out her hand.

“It remembers you,” she said. “That means it’s hungry.”

Cole nodded and stepped back.

“What do you want from me?” he asked.

Clara didn’t answer, but the land did.

The ground opened like an eyelid, slow and deliberate, revealing a staircase made of what looked like rib bones, spiraling down into darkness. A smell came from it, something old and metallic. Cole hesitated at the top, then looked at Clara.

“She’s down there,” she said. “If you still want to see her.”

He did.

And he didn’t.

But he went anyway.

The descent was quiet at first, the only sound his boots clicking against bone. Then came whispers. Dozens of them, then hundreds. Some in voices he knew—his father, June, even himself—others in languages he didn’t understand. Some didn’t sound like language at all, but more like music made from teeth and wind.

The staircase ended in a chamber shaped like a heart. Not metaphorically. It pulsed. Veins of red light throbbed along the walls. In the center, suspended like a marionette in an invisible web, was June.

Her eyes were open.

Her mouth stitched.

She wasn’t breathing, but her chest rose and fell in slow, unnatural rhythms. Threads of shadow bound her limbs, anchoring her to the ceiling, the walls, the floor. She looked at him, and her eyes filled with something like recognition—and something else, something darker.

Cole stepped forward, every part of him screaming against it. “June,” he whispered.

The threads tightened. Her face twitched.

Clara stood at the edge of the chamber, now less human than ever. Her fingers had grown longer, the bones showing through translucent skin. Her eyes gleamed black.

“She’s not what she was. But she can be again. For a price.”

Cole gritted his teeth. “What kind of price?”

Clara smiled. “A memory. A deep one. The first time you loved her. The moment you promised her forever. That’s the currency here.”

He hesitated.

“That moment is all I have left,” he said.

Clara reached out. “Then it’s worth more.”

Cole closed his eyes. The memory came easily—bonfire smoke curling around June’s hair, her voice singing off-key, both of them laughing, dancing barefoot in the dirt. The moon full, the music distant, and the feeling so big it had nearly crushed him.

When he opened his eyes, Clara was already unraveling something in the air, drawing the memory from him like thread pulled from a sleeve. He felt it leave—a sudden coldness in his ribs, a lightness in his skull. The memory was gone. Not faded. Not tucked away.

Gone.

June stirred.

The threads around her limbs loosened, twitched. Her lips parted. A gasp escaped, thin and broken.

“Cole?” she said, voice like a whisper caught in wind.

He stepped closer. “I’m here. I found you.”

Her face crumpled. “I—I thought I was lost.”

“You were. But I came.”

Then she looked around the chamber, her eyes wide. “We have to go. Before it wakes.”

Before he could ask, the walls shuddered. A low groan filled the chamber, like the world itself crying out in hunger. The veins of red light flickered.

Clara was gone.

In her place stood something tall and thin, draped in shadow, faceless, but with eyes blooming across its chest and arms like blossoms made of bone. It stepped into the chamber without a sound.

June screamed.

Cole raised the rifle.

The thing didn’t flinch. It only lifted a long, bony hand and pointed at them both. The chamber began to close, the ceiling lowering, the walls pulsing faster.

“Run,” June said.

They ran.

Up the stairs. Through the pulsing ribs. Out into the Hollow.

The sky above them was darker now, less red, more bruise-colored. Shapes moved in the distance—tall, thin, crawling. The world was no longer sleeping. It was waking. And it was angry.

Cole pulled June behind him, every instinct screaming. He didn’t know where to go. The Hollow didn’t have directions. But she seemed to.

“Trust me,” she said. “I remember how to leave.”

They ran toward a ruin on the edge of the field. It looked like a church—or what was left of one. Half-buried, stone crumbling, bell tower leaning like a drunk. Inside, a mirror stood against the far wall. Not glass. Something older. Polished obsidian, maybe. It shimmered.

“We go through,” June said.

Behind them, the thing from the chamber emerged into the open.

Cole didn’t look back. He grabbed June’s hand and jumped.

The world tore.

And then he was on his knees, coughing dirt, the wind of Garza Ridge howling around him. The sky was blue. The sun real.

The well behind them smoked, faintly.

June collapsed beside him.

They were home.

But not alone.

The earth beneath them was trembling. Not violently, not yet, but in subtle, rhythmic pulses, like a drumbeat coming up from beneath the surface. Cole felt it in his knees first, then in his chest, like his heart was syncing with something older, something vast and unsympathetic.

June was unconscious, or near enough to it—her breath shallow, her skin cold to the touch. He pulled off his jacket and wrapped it around her, crouching beside her in the grass near the now-silent mouth of the well. It no longer smoked, but the air around it shimmered like heat haze even though the morning was cool. Something had been left behind, some residue from the Hollow that hadn’t been erased by their return.

He scanned the horizon. No sign of Clara. No movement at all. The birds had stopped singing. Even the insects were quiet.

Cole stood, his legs shaky, and looked back down at the well. He didn’t trust it. The stillness around it felt performative, like the land was pretending to be dormant. He slung his rifle and carefully lifted June into his arms. She didn’t stir, but her head lolled against his shoulder and her lips moved faintly, whispering words he couldn’t make out. The tone was pleading, soft and broken—like a prayer being uttered from the bottom of a deep pit.

He carried her to the truck and laid her gently across the bench seat. Before starting the engine, he took one last look at the field behind them. Something had changed. The trees on the edge of the Maddox property were leaning inward now, as if the forest was watching, listening, deciding. And there was a figure just past the tree line—too far to see clearly, but tall, unmoving, and somehow familiar.

He drove fast.

June woke three hours later, just as they pulled into Buckley’s driveway. She sat up slowly, her movements mechanical, as if her joints didn’t remember how they were supposed to work. Her eyes were distant, rimmed in red, the whites streaked with veins. Cole helped her inside while Buckley stared from the porch, disbelief and horror pulling his face into a grimace.

“I thought she was—”

“She was,” Cole said, gently guiding June to the couch. “Now she’s not.”

Buckley closed the door behind them, locking it with unnecessary force. “What the hell does that mean?”

“It means we brought something back.”

June looked up, her voice faint. “I wasn’t alone in there. And whatever watches from the other side… it’s not finished. It doesn’t forgive. It doesn’t forget.”

Buckley blinked. “You talk like it’s alive.”

“It’s worse,” she said. “It’s aware.”

She pulled her knees up to her chest, shaking slightly. Buckley glanced at Cole, who only shook his head. There was too much to explain and not enough language to explain it.

“She needs rest,” Cole muttered.

“She needs a damn exorcist,” Buckley replied.

That night, June slept in the spare room while Cole sat at the kitchen table with the maps and the journal laid out before him. Buckley poured bourbon into two chipped glasses and slid one across the table.

“You’ve always been a little off,” he said, sipping. “But now you’re walkin’ back into town with ghosts on your back and eyes like you’ve seen through the seams of the world.”

Cole said nothing. He traced the circle on the map again, the one marked La Cuna. Beneath it, he’d scribbled a single word in pen: Gate.

“She said the Hollow marked me,” Cole said after a long silence. “That it knows me now. That I’ve seen too much, and the Hollow doesn't let go once it's got your scent.”

Buckley leaned back. “Then why’d it let you leave?”

Cole shook his head. “Because it wants me to come back.”

“And June?”

“She was a door,” he said. “And now she’s something else. Something in-between.”

Buckley drained his glass and stared out the window. “I knew your father used to dig holes out by the northern fence line. Said he was looking for a gas line leak. Found out later there wasn’t a line there at all. He said he heard breathing in the dirt.”

Cole’s eyes met the sheriff’s.

“I think it’s always been here,” Cole said. “Long before us. The well wasn’t the beginning. It was just a symptom.”

In the middle of the night, June screamed.

Cole burst into the room, rifle in hand, but she was alone, clawing at the blankets like she was trying to escape her own skin. He dropped the rifle and held her shoulders until she stopped thrashing.

“It’s in the mirrors,” she whispered, breath ragged. “That’s how it watches now.”

Cole looked toward the dresser, where the small vanity mirror reflected the room in perfect silence. He walked over, grabbed a towel, and draped it over the glass. Then another, and another. Every surface that reflected—gone.

June wept quietly as he sat beside her.

“They kept me in a place without time,” she said. “There were no clocks. No days. Just... presence. It waits. It listens to your thoughts, sifts through your memories. And when you start to forget who you are, it fills in the blanks.”

Cole rubbed her back gently. “You’re here now. You’re real.”

“But I’m not whole,” she said. “It took something.”

“We’ll get it back.”

“No, Cole,” she said, grabbing his hand. “We don’t go back. Not again. If we do, it won’t be to rescue. It’ll be to replace.”

The next few days were quiet, but wrong. A pressure hung over the town like a storm that refused to break. People walked slower. Animals stayed close to the ground. The church bell rang at noon without anyone pulling the rope. Three children went missing, last seen near the creek bed. When their bikes were found, the rubber on the tires was melted, and the spokes had been bent into spirals.

Cole knew it was spreading.

The Hollow had followed them.

At dusk, he and Buckley stood at the edge of the field where the well used to be. It was gone now. No stones, no markings, no sign it had ever been there. Just scorched grass that refused to grow back.

“There was a time I thought all we needed was more law,” Buckley said. “Rules. Fences. Guns. Turns out we needed less digging.”

Cole didn’t laugh. “It wants a tether. Someone here to hold the door open.”

“Think it’s June?”

Cole shook his head. “No. She fought it. She was a gate, but not by choice.”

He looked out across the horizon.

“I think it’s me.”

And in the wind, something whispered his name.

Not aloud.

Inside.

Chapter Four: Teeth in the Soil

Cole stood in front of the bathroom mirror for a long time the next morning, afraid to look and afraid not to. He had covered every reflective surface in Buckley’s house with towels and newspaper the night before, even the glass on the family photos, but something inside him itched to peel them all off and stare—really stare—into his own face. He’d noticed changes. Subtle at first. His eyes sometimes looked too dark in low light. His reflection seemed to blink slower than he did, and twice now he’d heard whispers coming from his own breath when he spoke alone. The Hollow had touched him, not like June, not completely, but enough to mark him. He was still himself. He thought. But the soil under his boots felt closer than it used to, like it knew his weight now, remembered his footsteps.

June was stronger today. She sat upright on the porch, wrapped in one of Buckley’s old flannel coats, drinking coffee she didn’t taste. The birds still hadn’t come back, and the leaves on the trees no longer swayed even when the wind blew. Time moved differently now, thick as syrup, and the town was beginning to unravel around them. Reports had come in that the church organ had begun playing by itself. The elementary school closed early the day before when every fish in the science lab died within the same second—wounds on their sides like they’d been turned inside out.

Buckley had stopped shaving. He paced more. Talked less. He hadn’t opened the station for two days, and no one seemed to notice.

“This place is folding,” Cole said as he stood beside June, looking out across the patchy grass and toward the invisible line that separated the ranch from the rest of the world.

“No,” she murmured. “It’s being rewritten.”

He turned toward her. “What do you mean?”

“I told you,” she said, fingers twitching slightly against the mug. “It waits. It listens. It gathers pieces of you, and then it builds. But it never builds from whole truths—just fragments. Grief. Fear. Regret. It rebuilds the world with what it thinks you deserve.”

Cole thought of the house that had appeared in the Hollow. His house, but wrong. The blood-slick windowpanes, the doors that didn’t open, the fireplace that had whispered his name in his father’s voice.

“It’s making a new Garza Ridge,” he said.

She nodded slowly. “One that won’t let you leave.”

That night, Buckley finally spoke. He stood in the doorway, cleaning his shotgun as though he didn’t know what else to do with his hands. “We had another missing kid. Henry Walters’ boy. Seven years old. Went out to the barn for a wrench. Never came back. They found the barn door still locked from the outside.”

Cole’s jaw clenched. “And?”

“And there were footprints in the hay,” Buckley said. “But not just one set. Two. The second pair was barefoot. And they were... backward. Like someone was walking in reverse.”

“Jesus.”

“I think this town’s already gone,” Buckley said quietly. “I just don’t know if we’re the last ones to notice or the last ones it hasn’t replaced yet.”

They were silent for a while.

Then Cole said, “There’s a way to stop it.”

Buckley looked at him hard. “I figured that was coming. Let’s hear it.”

“It’s not just the well. It’s the land. The Hollow’s using it. Drawing strength through every unspoken secret, every wound people didn’t let scab over. And there’s something deep—deeper than we’ve gone. Beneath the place June and I crossed. I felt it. Something old.”

Buckley exhaled through his nose. “You want to dig.”

“I want to burn.”

June looked up from her seat. “It won’t let you.”

“Maybe not,” Cole said. “But I’m going to try.”

They gathered supplies—kerosene, salt, iron nails, rope, and a box of old dynamite from Buckley’s late father’s mining shed. The sheriff muttered something about the ATF having a heart attack if they knew, but nobody was laughing.

The site had shifted again. When they arrived, the clearing where the well had been was now a wide circle of blackened earth, perfect in its diameter, with no trees near the edge. The grass didn’t grow there. No birds flew overhead. The soil crunched like ash under their feet.

Cole marked a spot near the center and began digging. It was harder than it should’ve been—he hit stone barely two feet down. Not natural stone. Carved. Geometric.

“Foundations?” Buckley asked.

“No. Markers,” June said. “Boundary stones.”

“What’s beneath?”

She looked at Cole. “If it works the way I remember, a core. The Hollow’s anchor in our world. A root.”

“Then we sever it,” Cole said.

But before they could go deeper, the air changed. It thickened, went colder despite the summer night. The trees at the edge of the clearing groaned, and then—one by one—began to turn.

Not fall.

Turn.

Their trunks twisted slowly, bark shrieking like teeth grinding. Branches bent inward toward the circle.

Then came the sound—no voice, no wind. Just a groan like the earth itself was crying out in mourning.

“We don’t have much time,” June whispered.

They poured the kerosene. Set the charges. Drew the salt in thick, unbroken lines. Buckley read from Elias Varn’s notes—words that tasted like iron and smoke, straining the throat, bleeding the ears.

The ground began to move.

The center of the circle broke open like a blister, revealing a cavity beneath—a mass of black vines, or roots, or tendrils pulsing in slow waves. It was alive. And it saw them.

Cole stepped to the edge, holding the flare.

“You sure about this?” Buckley asked.

“No.”

He dropped the flare.

The fire caught fast. Too fast. It roared down into the cavity like breath drawn into a furnace. The vines writhed, screeched, thrashed. The ground shook so violently Cole fell, cracking his shoulder against the dirt. June screamed his name but the sound was distant, like she was on the other side of glass.

Then came the light.

Not firelight—something blinding. White and silver. It burst from the hole, tore through the clearing, lit up the entire horizon.

And then…

Silence.

Cole awoke in the hospital two days later.

Buckley sat in the chair beside him, his arm in a sling, his eyes bloodshot.

“You did it,” he said. “I don’t know how, but the land’s quiet again. No more disappearances. No more cold spots. June’s okay. She hasn’t said much, but she smiles again. Birds came back this morning.”

Cole tried to speak. His throat was raw.

“You’ll be all right,” Buckley said. “The doctor says it was shock. Just need time.”

Cole nodded slowly. He didn’t know what to say.

He dreamed that night. But not of the Hollow.

He dreamed of a tree. Alone on a hill. Its branches dead, but beneath it, the earth pulsed. Just once.

Like a breath.

A reminder.

It wasn’t over.

Not completely.

Just resting.

Waiting.

The next morning, Cole walked through Garza Ridge with a cautious eye and a war-tuned mind. He moved slowly, listening for what wasn’t there anymore—the hush of something watching, the tremble of air around corners, the unspoken tension that had lived in every porch swing, every half-drawn curtain. And though the town seemed calm now, almost normal, it was the stillness that unnerved him. It felt like the end of a conversation he hadn’t finished, like the silence before someone says your name in a voice you thought you’d buried.

The townspeople greeted him cautiously. More than one stared too long, their expressions unreadable, like they were trying to decide if he was still one of them or something else. Cole didn’t blame them. He wasn’t sure of the answer himself.

By midday, he found himself standing at the edge of the clearing again, where the well had been, where they’d lit the fire and dropped the charges. The grass still hadn’t grown back. The circle remained a perfect scar—burnt soil, cracked in spiderweb lines, like the earth had blistered and scabbed over. No birds flew overhead. Even now, the air above the site shimmered faintly, like oil on water.

Buckley joined him without speaking, a thermos of coffee in his hand. They stood there a while, two men bound not by friendship or history, but by the kind of shared memory that leaves marks deeper than any scar. Finally, Buckley said, “I had a dream last night. Thought it was just bourbon at first.”

Cole didn’t take his eyes off the circle. “What kind of dream?”

“There was a woman in my kitchen,” Buckley said slowly. “Couldn’t see her face. She was humming something I half-recognized. Something my mother used to sing when I was a kid. But she didn’t have a shadow. I watched for ten whole minutes, and her shadow never moved.”

“Could’ve been just a dream.”

“I don’t think so,” Buckley muttered. “I think something passed through when you lit that fire. Something didn’t burn.”

Cole’s shoulders tightened. “Then maybe we didn’t go deep enough.”

“No,” Buckley said, shaking his head. “You went too deep. You opened something that doesn’t close easy. It just learns how to stay hidden.”

They walked the perimeter of the clearing, silent, until they reached a place where the ground looked different—darker, like charcoal beneath the surface. Cole crouched and touched the soil. It was warm. Not from the sun.

“They’re watching,” he said. “Still watching.”

Buckley lit a cigarette. “I’ve been sheriff here for twenty-seven years. Thought I’d seen everything. Bar fights, coyotes in the schoolyard, a twister tearing through the feed store. But this…” He glanced down at the burnt earth. “This ain’t something you report. This is something you survive.”

That night, June woke screaming again.

Cole was already halfway down the hall when she hit the floor, tangled in blankets, clawing at her own skin as if trying to dig something out from beneath it. He dropped to his knees beside her and grabbed her wrists gently but firmly.

“June. June! It’s okay. It’s me.”

She blinked hard, pupils huge, sweat beading on her skin. “He’s here. In me. I can feel him.”

Cole looked over his shoulder. The room was empty, but the shadows on the wall didn’t quite match the angles they should have.

“What did you see?”

She shook her head violently. “It wasn’t a dream. It was a memory. But not mine. He’s showing me things, Cole. Feeding me pieces of his world. And it’s wrong. It’s so wrong.”

Cole held her close. Her heart was racing, wild and uneven. She whispered, “He wants to build.”

“Build what?”

“A door.”

The next few days were calm again, but it was the kind of calm that comes after a fire—when everything’s gone, but you can still smell the smoke. The town tried to heal. People returned to church. Children played in backyards again. But the sense of safety was brittle, like glass already spidered with cracks.

Cole met with Elias Varn one final time, in a motel off the freeway just outside Lubbock. Elias looked older, thinner, as if the weight of knowing too much had started to bend his bones.

“You lit the root,” Elias said. “That was the only thing that kept it anchored. But the Hollow isn’t like us. It doesn’t die. It reconfigures.”

Cole nodded. “It’s still here. Beneath us.”

“Yes. But diminished. Injured.”

“Can it recover?”

Elias hesitated. “In time. If you let it.”

Cole leaned forward. “Then what do I do?”

Elias handed him a leather pouch, stitched in a cross pattern. “You wear this. Never take it off. It’s not protection exactly, but it’ll mark you as claimed. The Hollow won’t feed on what it thinks it already owns.”

Cole frowned. “You mean it thinks I belong to it?”

“It doesn’t think,” Elias said. “It knows. And yes.”

Cole took the pouch and slipped it around his neck. It was warm against his skin, and it smelled like burnt sage and rusted iron.

Back in Garza Ridge, the ground stayed quiet. The school reopened. The church bells rang at normal times. And no one else disappeared.

But Cole didn’t trust the peace.

One evening, he took a walk to the north field—land that hadn’t been tilled in over a decade. It was flat and empty, save for a single wooden post that used to mark the property line. At its base was a small pile of rocks, arranged in a spiral. He hadn’t placed them there.

As he approached, he heard something beneath the wind. A hum. Soft and low, like a lullaby hummed through teeth.

He didn’t disturb the rocks.

Instead, he went home and told June what he’d seen. She didn’t seem surprised.

“It’ll be back,” she said.

He nodded. “I know.”

She looked at him across the table. “Will you go back in?”

“If I have to,” he said.

“Even if it costs you the rest of what’s left?”

Cole didn’t answer for a long time. Then he said, “This place is mine. If something’s going to bleed here, it should be me.”

June reached across the table and took his hand. Her eyes were clearer now, less hollow.

“Then we fight together next time.”

He squeezed her fingers gently.

Next time.

Because there would be a next time.

You don’t open a door like the Hollow and expect it to stay shut.

Not forever.

The following days bloomed with a strange, artificial normalcy. June took to walking the perimeter of the Maddox land every morning at dawn, barefoot, eyes low to the grass, as if searching for cracks in the earth that didn’t belong. Cole joined her more often than not, rifle slung lazily across his shoulder, though they both knew it was mostly for comfort now. Whatever was watching them—if it still watched—wasn’t the kind of thing that answered to bullets.

Buckley, true to form, tried to get the town back on its feet. He resumed his duties as sheriff, held a town meeting in the church basement, tried to quiet the rumors about strange lights or voices echoing through the fields after dark. Folks nodded and smiled and pretended to believe him, but there was a hollowness in the way they shuffled out when it ended, the way no one made eye contact for too long.

Cole noticed it most clearly on a Saturday morning, when he walked into the hardware store for nails and came out with a heavy silence trailing behind him. Mr. Salgado, the owner, had greeted him kindly enough, but there’d been something odd in his smile, something brittle. And the customers—two teenage boys and a middle-aged woman he’d known since high school—had all stopped talking the second he walked in. They watched him without watching, bodies still, eyes just slightly too wide.

When he stepped back outside into the sun, the whole street looked strange. It wasn’t what was there—it was what wasn’t. No wind. No birds. No tire hum. Just the sound of his own boots against the pavement and the sharp tick of the clock above the pharmacy, which hadn’t worked in years but now moved in perfect rhythm.

He drove home faster than he intended.

That night, he asked June if she had seen anything during her walk.

She nodded once, slowly. “There was a child standing in the south field. Pale. Dressed in red. I waved. It didn’t move. I blinked. It was gone.”

Cole felt the tightness in his gut return. “Was it one of the missing?”

“No,” she said. “I think it was something else. Something wearing the shape of memory.”

She paused, frowning, and touched her wrist absentmindedly.

“Cole,” she added, “have you noticed how long the nights are now?”

He hadn’t, not consciously. But once she said it, he realized she was right. Darkness came earlier, and the sun seemed to linger less with each passing day. The stars overhead were wrong too—unfamiliar constellations, or at least, constellations he couldn’t name. The moon, when it rose, was a little too full. A little too red. And it never seemed to set in quite the same spot.

He opened Elias’s pouch again that night and removed the note folded between the herb bundles. The ink had faded since he last read it, but the words were burned into his mind:

“The Hollow is a mimic. It copies what it cannot create. When it cannot feed, it listens. When it cannot listen, it grows teeth.”

He folded the note and placed it back inside the pouch.

June began to sleep less. She told Cole that dreams weren’t safe anymore, that they were being seeded like farmland. “He plants questions,” she said. “Then waits to see what grows.” Sometimes, she’d speak in her sleep, not words, but a cadence—low, old, more rhythm than language. Cole recorded one of the murmurs and played it for Elias over the phone.

There was a long pause.

“That’s not a language I recognize,” Elias finally said. “But the pattern... it’s recursive. Non-human recursion. You’re lucky it didn’t speak directly. Some of those patterns don’t leave the brain clean.”

“What do I do?”

“Keep her grounded. Feed her real things. Taste, touch, music. Memory. If she starts to forget who she was, that’s when it will try again.”

Cole sat by her bedside that night with a guitar he hadn’t touched in years. He played softly, fingerpicking old country blues under his breath. June didn’t wake, but her breathing steadied, her fists unclenched.

Afterward, he took a walk outside.

The clearing where the well had stood was quiet again. No ash. No warmth. But he knelt and placed a hand on the soil anyway.

It pulsed, faint but real.

A rhythm.

A heartbeat.

Cole’s eyes narrowed. It wasn’t gone.

It was healing.

And if it healed, it would need a shape.

He woke the next morning to find June standing in the kitchen with a cast-iron skillet in her hands, eggs already cooking, the sizzle loud in the quiet room. It felt jarringly normal. Like a film scene. She smiled, almost naturally.

“I think we should leave,” she said.

Cole poured himself coffee. “Leave the ranch?”

“Leave Garza Ridge.”

He didn’t answer right away.

“I know it sounds sudden,” she said. “But it’s not. I’ve been thinking about it for days.”

“We don’t know if it’ll follow.”

“We don’t know if it won’t,” she said. “But maybe it’s not us anymore. Maybe it’s here. And maybe if we stay... we become part of it.”

Cole stared at his coffee. The smell was too strong. The heat too weak.

“Everything in this town feels like it’s pretending,” he said. “Like the world put on a mask and forgot how to take it off.”

She touched his hand gently. “Then let’s not pretend.”

They packed that afternoon.

They didn’t tell Buckley, though Cole left a note in the mailbox outside the sheriff’s office. The words were simple:

"Going west. Not running. Just choosing. If it wakes again, you’ll feel it. Burn it deeper this time."

He signed it with just his name.

They drove west past sundown, the truck heavy with silence, the fields stretching behind them like history. June slept curled in the passenger seat, the pouch from Elias now hanging around her neck. Cole watched the sky as he drove, half-hoping for stars he recognized.

Half-hoping not to.

When they crossed into the next county, something strange happened. The radio—dead for weeks—clicked on by itself. Static. Then a song.

An old country tune neither of them had ever heard, but somehow knew every word of.

June opened her eyes.

She didn’t smile.

But she sang along.

And behind them, buried deep beneath Garza Ridge, something stirred in the soil—gently, like a child turning in sleep.

Its time would come again.

But not today.

Chapter Five: The West Is Listening

They drove for three days without stopping anywhere longer than necessary. June seemed lighter, more present the farther they got from Garza Ridge. She watched the landscape slip by with cautious awe, her fingers tracing idle lines on the truck’s dusty dashboard like she was feeling the world through movement again. Cole said little. He watched the road with a soldier’s vigilance, half expecting it to split open or disappear entirely. He trusted highways less than people. Concrete could lie just as easily.

They stopped in the mountains west of Albuquerque, a place Cole had been once during a forgotten summer, back when he’d been too young to understand what real silence meant. They found a cabin through a local who didn’t ask questions, paid in cash, and spent the first full day just listening to the wind come off the ridges.

There were no mirrors in the cabin. June made sure of it.

At night, Cole sat on the porch with a beer and a notebook, trying to record the events that had led them here. But the words didn’t come clean. They twisted. Paragraphs rearranged themselves when he looked away. Sometimes a line he hadn’t written would appear halfway down the page—always in his handwriting, always about the Hollow.

One entry read: “We left, but it didn’t. It stayed, yes. But it planted itself inside the parts we didn’t bring.”

He tore the page out and burned it in a rusted tin bucket beside the steps. The fire didn’t give off smoke.

The next morning, June was already awake and dressed, sitting on a boulder that overlooked the tree line below. She held a pinecone in her lap and was slowly, deliberately, pulling it apart.

“We’re going to be okay,” she said, before he could even speak.

“You sound sure.”

“I’m not,” she said. “But the land here doesn’t whisper. That has to count for something.”

They hiked that day. Not far, not fast—just enough to breathe again. June pointed out birds she didn’t remember the names for. Cole tested the soil under their boots like it might open at any moment.

“I dreamed of a fence last night,” June said as they rested under a patch of ponderosa. “It surrounded the ranch, but it wasn’t made of wood. It was made of mouths. All whispering in different languages. When I tried to get close, they bit the air.”

Cole picked up a fallen branch and turned it in his hands. “Do you think it’s still inside you?”

She hesitated. “I think... some version of me never left.”

He looked at her. “And the version sitting here?”

She offered a small smile. “She’s stubborn.”

That night, they cooked over a small fire inside the hearth. Cole found a battered old radio in the cabin’s kitchen and fiddled with the dial until it landed on a local country station. It was faint, but real. Songs about trains and rust and women who never looked back. June hummed along, off-key but relaxed.

Around midnight, Cole woke to a sound.

Not loud.

Just… steady.

Like fingernails tapping glass.

He sat up. June was asleep beside him, her breathing even. The cabin was dark. The sound came again—five taps, slow, from the far end of the room. Then silence.

Cole reached under the bed for the small iron knife he kept nearby. It was dull, but heavy.

He moved toward the sound.

There was nothing at the window.

No wind.

No prints in the dirt outside.

But on the glass, in the condensation from their breath, a single word had been written:

“soon.”

They stayed two more weeks.

In that time, nothing overtly strange happened. The mountains were kind. The trees didn’t move. The water from the spring behind the cabin tasted clean. June grew stronger. She started sketching again, using charcoal on leftover cardboard and packing paper. Mostly landscapes. One or two portraits. Then one drawing she didn’t show Cole at first.

He found it on the last day.

It was of the ranch, but altered. The land curled inward around a black circle. The house had no doors. And in the sky above, there was a face.

Not clear.

Not human.

Just the hint of something vast.

When he asked about it, she folded the sketch in half and said, “It’s not a warning. It’s a memory. I needed to put it somewhere.”

They burned the drawing together.

That night, as they packed the truck, Cole looked at the northern sky. There were stars again. Some he knew. Orion. Cassiopeia. The Big Dipper. They blinked in patterns that didn’t whisper or rearrange. That felt like proof.

But as they left the cabin, the radio clicked on again.

Same station. Different song.

Only this time, the lyrics weren’t in English.

Weren’t in anything he recognized.

Just voices layered on top of each other, singing something with teeth.

June reached forward and turned it off.

Neither of them spoke for the next hour.

In the town of Ignacio, Colorado, they checked into a roadside motel and told the clerk they were just passing through. June waited in the room while Cole visited the local library. He asked for books on borderlands, fault lines, and oral legends tied to the mountains. The librarian—a thin man with a smoker’s cough and eyes too sharp for someone so soft-spoken—pointed him toward a local archive in the basement.

“You want stories,” he said. “You’ll find more than you want down there.”

Cole didn’t correct him.

In the basement, he found a map.

Old. Hand-drawn. Etched into rawhide.

It showed a series of concentric circles around what looked like a cave system in northern New Mexico. A word had been scratched across the outermost ring in red ink, faded but readable.

“Hollon.”

It wasn’t spelled like “Hollow.”

But it felt the same.

Beneath it, in smaller letters, something else:

“Listen long enough and it speaks in your name.”

Cole folded the hide map and tucked it into his jacket.

He knew now what the Hollow had meant by soon.

It had names.

Faces.

Places.

It had always had them.

And it was moving west.

Just like they were.

They stayed in Ignacio longer than intended. June had taken a liking to the dry clarity of the place—the way the sky stretched without interruption, the way the wind didn’t seem to carry secrets. Cole, however, felt a slow burn in his chest that wouldn’t settle. It wasn’t fear. It was expectation. Like he was holding his breath for a moment that hadn’t yet arrived.

He kept the rawhide map folded in his coat, glancing at it more than he should’ve. It showed paths that didn’t exist on any highway system. Trails cut through wilderness, mountains, old roads barely remembered. Places not marked, only known. The cave system—marked as “Hollon”—appeared to lie somewhere near the Four Corners, where four states touched like old ghosts shaking hands. That idea lingered in his head: things touching. Lines blurring.

He didn’t tell June about the map until the fifth morning, when they sat outside the motel eating toast and scrambled eggs from a diner down the street.

“We’re not out,” he said. “Not completely.”

June wiped a crumb from the corner of her mouth. “I know.”

“There’s something ahead. Something tied to this. To the Hollow.”

“Is it calling you?” she asked, but her tone wasn’t mocking.

“Not calling. Just... waiting. Like it already knows I’ll show up.”

She nodded slowly. “Then we don’t run. We choose the path forward.”

Cole pulled the map from his coat and laid it between them on the table. The hide was stiff from age, edges curled, the ink almost bled away in spots. But the symbols were clear enough.

“Here,” he said, pointing to the marked circle. “This is the convergence point. It may be another door. Another version of the well.”

June traced the lines with her fingertip. “Why here? Why not stay rooted in Garza Ridge?”

“Maybe that place fed it too long,” he said. “Maybe it wants new ground. Or maybe... it follows the blood.”

June’s face darkened at that. She didn’t ask what he meant. She knew. His family’s presence in Texas, her own ancestry rooted in the land, the old warnings wrapped in stories—none of it had been random. The Hollow had never been a single place. It was a pattern. A method. A net.

By noon, they were on the road again, this time cutting north by northwest through thin, winding passes. Pines gave way to scrub. The elevation climbed. Cell signals died. The horizon widened.

And then, just before dusk, they found the trailhead.

It wasn’t marked by any sign—just a leaning wooden post wrapped in rusted wire, a shape barely visible from the road unless you knew what to look for. Cole stopped the truck. June opened the passenger door before he could ask.

They hiked in silence for hours, the trail narrowing until it became a path only deer or spirits might’ve used. The map led them around a dried-out riverbed, then up a low ridge that overlooked a hollow valley pocked with boulders and scrub trees. At the far end was the entrance—a jagged mouth in the stone face, half-hidden by brush. It was colder here, not from weather but presence. The air had weight.

As they approached, June stopped.

“There’s something here already.”

Cole scanned the shadows. “I don’t see anything.”

“Not see. Feel.”

They entered with flashlights, voices low, the only sound the crunch of gravel and the hiss of wind trailing behind them like breath.

The tunnel curved down and inward, leading them into a tight, dry corridor that opened into a wide chamber etched with carvings. Not writing—symbols. Spirals. Hands. Eyes. Teeth.

At the center of the cave, carved directly into the rock, was a basin. Empty.

Then June whispered, “It’s listening.”

Cole turned.

Her pupils were dilated. Her breathing shallow. She touched the edge of the basin and flinched.

“It knows we’re here,” she said. “And it’s showing me things.”

He pulled her hand away. “June—”

“I see children walking backward through snow. A woman with three mouths speaking to a mirror that doesn’t reflect her. I see your father. I see—” She gasped.

“What?”

“I see us. But not us. Not alive.”

Cole turned back toward the basin.

A sound echoed from deep within the cave.

Footsteps.

But not approaching.

Receding.

Like something walking deeper, drawing them with it.

Cole steadied his breath.

Then he saw it—etched into the back wall of the chamber, faint but unmistakable:

A circle. A well. Surrounded by four figures. One of them holding a rifle.

He stepped closer, shining the light against the stone. The carving was old. Very old.

“June,” he said softly. “They’ve been waiting for us longer than we’ve been alive.”

She stood behind him, trembling. “That’s not prophecy,” she said. “That’s memory.”

They stayed only long enough to take pictures, then backed out the way they came. As they climbed back toward the ridge, the air grew warmer. The trailhead came into view. The truck sat undisturbed.

But something was different.

In the dust on the windshield, four words had been drawn by a single fingertip:

YOU CANNOT UNSEE US.

They drove south that night, farther than they needed to, until they reached the border of Arizona. June refused to sleep in the truck. She said the rearview mirror had started to hum.

Cole stayed awake most of the night, listening to the hiss of cicadas and the distant howl of something he couldn’t name. He thought about the carvings, about the four figures around the well.

One of them had been holding something in their hand.

Not a rifle.

A book.

When the sun rose, June stirred beside him. Her eyes were red, but clear.

“We’re part of this now,” she said. “No matter where we go.”

He nodded. “Then we decide what it becomes.”

And behind them, somewhere in the stone, a voice neither of them heard whispered one word:

“Soon.”

Chapter Six: A Mouth in the Stone

The sun rose over the Arizona border in a smear of blood-orange light, washing the desert in color too vivid to feel safe. Cole leaned against the hood of the truck, watching June rinse her face at the motel sink just inside the open door. They hadn’t said much since leaving the cave. Some truths were too raw to look at in daylight. Whatever had spoken to them through carvings older than the borders they drove past—it hadn’t lied. That was what unnerved him most.

They weren’t being hunted.

They were being remembered.

As if the Hollow, or whatever deeper thing hid behind it, had already mapped every mile they would drive, every shadow they would cast. He could feel it in his blood now, like a hum just beneath his pulse. Memory repurposed as hunger.

June stepped out, towel around her neck. “We need to talk,” she said.

He nodded, already knowing the tone in her voice meant they were past the planning stage. This was the decision.

“We have a choice,” she said. “Either we keep running—north, west, into the Pacific if we have to—or we go back and end this the only way it’s ever going to end.”

“We don’t know what that means,” Cole replied. “We don’t even know if it can end.”

“But it’s moving now. Not just watching. Growing. That carving in the cave—it wasn’t a warning. It was a guide.”

She sat beside him on the hood. The truck groaned beneath their weight.

“I dreamed again,” she whispered. “But it wasn’t like the others. I wasn’t seeing the Hollow. I was inside it. I could feel the shape of it. Not just a place—it’s a system. A parasite. It digs into belief. Ritual. Emotion. It doesn’t just live off fear—it reorganizes the world into something it can breathe.”

Cole stared at the cracked pavement.

“And?”

“And I saw the next well,” she said. “It’s already forming. Not a pit this time. A mouth. It’s trying a new shape.”

He exhaled. “Where?”

She looked at him, eyes hollowed by too little sleep and too much knowing. “Garza Ridge.”

They drove back in silence. No music. No radio. No words. The road peeled away behind them like something being unmade. Cole kept one hand on the wheel, the other on the pouch around his neck. He didn’t need a compass anymore. The Hollow tugged at him like a magnet through meat. And it was stronger now. No longer passive. No longer silent.

They reached the edge of Garza Ridge just past dusk. The lights were all wrong—too yellow, too many. The town looked normal at a glance, but as they rolled down Main Street, Cole saw the difference. People were standing still on porches. Not talking. Not smoking. Just... waiting.

Every head turned as they passed.

June looked down. “They’re not people anymore.”

“No,” Cole said. “They’re echoes.”

They didn’t stop in town. They drove straight for the ranch.

The house was still standing, but barely. One side of the roof had caved in, and vines that hadn’t been there before now strangled the porch posts. Not green vines. Black. Veined with something silver that moved if you looked too long.

They parked in the same place they always had, and Cole walked slowly to the front steps.

The door was open.

Inside, it was cold. Not the cold of weather—but of something ancient mimicking temperature. The living room had changed. The walls were covered in pages—dozens of them, maybe hundreds—torn from books, journals, newspapers. They fluttered slightly, though there was no breeze.

He recognized June’s handwriting on several of them.

Then his own.

Some were in neither.

In the center of the room stood a figure.

It took Cole a full minute to realize it was a mirror.

A full-length one, cracked at the top corner, propped up like a person about to speak. June stepped closer, breath hitching. “This wasn’t here before.”

“No,” Cole said. “But it is now.”

He stepped forward.

In the reflection, the room was the same.

But the people weren’t.

In the mirror, June was still bound by shadow threads, just as he’d seen her in the Hollow.

And he...

He wasn’t moving at all.

Just staring.

Mouth open, eyes blank.

A whisper hissed from the glass:

“You left the gate open.”

Cole raised his fist and shattered the mirror.

The room screamed.

Not June.

Not him.

The room.

The walls writhed. The pages flared up in sudden flame. Cole grabbed June’s wrist and dragged her out the front door just before the floor split open beneath where they’d stood.

Outside, the ground was changing.

The field to the west of the house—the one that had always lain fallow—was rising.

Bubbling.

Taking shape.

They ran toward it.

It wasn’t a well this time.

It was a ring of mouths.

Teeth of stone, lips made of ash. They didn’t move, but they hummed.

And the air trembled.

Buckley was there.

Or a version of him.

He stood at the edge of the ring, shotgun in hand, staring into the center. When Cole and June approached, he didn’t look away.

“I knew you’d come back,” he said, voice hoarse. “It told me.”

Cole stepped beside him. “How long?”

“Since the fire,” Buckley replied. “I thought I was okay. Thought I left it behind. But it just took its time. Got in through the cracks.”

He lifted the shotgun.

But didn’t aim it at them.

He pointed it at his own chest.

“Tell it I’m not a door,” he said. “Tell it I close.”

And then he pulled the trigger.

The sound echoed for miles.

The mouths stopped humming.

Then, one by one, they began to open.

Not in violence.

In welcome.

June screamed. Cole turned.

The ground beneath him shifted.

He fell.

And the Hollow swallowed him whole.

The fall wasn’t long, but it felt infinite. Cole dropped into blackness with his arms locked around his ribs, the wind howling past like laughter at the edge of a scream. There was no up, no down—only a dizzying sense of separation, as though the world he knew had been unzipped and he was being threaded into another.

When he hit the ground, it didn’t hurt. The surface was soft, like loam or ash. His flashlight—long dead—flickered uselessly in his hand. But there was a glow. A low, living pulse that didn’t come from above or below but from within the walls of the place. Everything breathed here. The stone. The air. Even the silence.

He stood slowly, brushing dirt from his jeans, and looked around.

This was not the Hollow he’d seen before.

This was deeper.

More complete.

The walls were smooth, calcified, veined with red light like capillaries under translucent skin. Symbols moved across the surface—growing, changing, vanishing—until he stopped trying to read them. The air reeked of salt and something sweet and sickly. Time had no rhythm. His thoughts bounced like stones across a still lake.

He walked.

The tunnel opened into a vast chamber—circular, domed like a cathedral turned inside out. Hanging from the ceiling were shapes he didn’t want to recognize. Some looked like people. Others... like what people became after too long in this place.

In the center of the chamber stood a slab. Not an altar. Not quite. More like a stage. And on it was him.

Not dead. Not sleeping.

Just standing there.

Waiting.

His double looked exactly like him in every way. Same jacket. Same scar above the eyebrow. Same posture. But its eyes weren’t right. Too dark. Too still.

“You’ve come far,” it said. The voice was identical. But hollow.

Cole stepped forward, fists clenched.

“What is this?” he asked.

“The place you built,” the double said. “Every time you remembered, you added to it. Every time you feared, you deepened it.”

“I didn’t build the Hollow.”

“You did,” it said. “You, and those like you. Those who mourn too loudly. Those who regret too long. Those who carve grief into the shape of gods.”

Cole shook his head. “No. I fought it. I burned it.”

“You taught it.”

The chamber trembled.

Behind the double, the wall split open. A mouth, vast and wet, lined with flickering teeth that shimmered like obsidian. A voice poured out—not words. Not sound. Something older than language. Cole felt it in the marrow of his bones.

The Hollow wasn’t speaking.

It was recognizing.

He stepped back. “I’m not yours.”

“You are,” the double said. “You always were. But there is a choice.”

The mouth widened.

June stepped from it.

Alive. Pale. Her hands shaking.

“I followed you,” she whispered. “I had to.”

Cole reached for her, but the moment their hands touched, the chamber screamed. Walls trembled. Light snapped and pulsed like a heartbeat spiraling out of control.

June grabbed his arm. “It’s feeding on us again. On what we could become.”

“I won’t let it,” Cole said.

The double stepped down from the slab.

“You cannot stop it,” it said. “But you can replace it.”

Cole blinked. “What?”

“It needs a form. A vessel. One willing to carry its memory into the world. You burned the gate. Now it needs a mouth.”

June’s fingers tightened on his sleeve. “Don’t listen.”

But Cole understood now.

Every horror, every dream, every whisper—they weren’t invasions. They were offerings. Invitations.

“You want me to carry it.”

The double smiled. “You already are.”

Then it opened its mouth wide, wider than humanly possible, until the void inside became a spiral. And from within it, came images.

June’s face at the lake, her hands bound by shadow.

Buckley on the porch, smiling with blood behind his teeth.

The girl in the rivergrass whispering June’s name.

His own face, reflected in glass, blinking a moment too late.

He fell to his knees.

June knelt beside him. “Fight it,” she said. “Or trap it. You don’t have to kill it. You just have to remember right.”

“What do you mean?”

“It doesn’t survive truth,” she said. “Only distortion. It grows in forgetting. In twisting the real.”

Cole looked at the spiral. The double. The walls.

Then he closed his eyes.

And remembered.

He remembered his mother’s voice singing in Spanish. His father teaching him to shoot beer cans off fenceposts. The first time he held June’s hand. The smell of fireworks on a summer night. The feel of dirt between his toes. The way grief really felt—not clean or poetic, but ugly and fractured and human.

And the chamber... changed.

The spiral collapsed.

The slab cracked.

The double screamed and clutched its head as light poured from its mouth.

The Hollow writhed.

But Cole stood.

He walked to the center of the chamber, grabbed a shard of fallen stone, and carved a symbol into the wall. His family brand. The one from the ranch gate.

“I carry what’s real,” he said aloud.

June joined him. “And I guard what isn’t.”

The Hollow howled. The chamber buckled.

And then—

Nothing.

Just stillness.

Just silence.

Then light.

When Cole opened his eyes, he was back on the ranch.

The field was empty. The mouths were gone. The house—still broken, but whole.

June lay beside him.

Breathing.

Alive.

The sky above was the right color again. The air didn’t hum.

They didn’t speak.

They just held each other.

And somewhere, far below the earth, the Hollow curled into sleep again.

Not dead.

Never dead.

But remembered.

And watched.

And named.

By morning, a warm wind swept across the Maddox ranch, dry and unfamiliar, like a new breath exhaled from old lungs. Cole stood in the ruined kitchen of the house, watching light crawl across the warped floorboards. The walls no longer hummed. The shadows didn’t shift. There were still cracks in the ceiling and vines clawing at the outside, but the house felt inert, like something that had finally let go of whatever it had been clutching for so long.

June moved carefully through the rooms, barefoot, dragging her fingers along the walls like she was trying to feel the memory of herself there. When she reached the window, she stopped and stared out at the field, now flattened and black, the circle burned away into loose earth.

“It’s gone, isn’t it?” she asked without turning around.

“No,” Cole said. “Just asleep. Or watching from further away.”

She nodded. “That’s what I thought. I can still feel it, like the echo of a scream in my teeth.”

They had survived, but survival didn’t mean escape. It meant something more complicated—endurance without clarity. The Hollow wasn’t something to be defeated like a beast or a storm. It had never been singular. It wasn’t even alive in the way Cole had first imagined. It was a pattern. A hunger stitched into the shape of memory. You didn’t destroy it. You resisted it. You recognized it for what it was.

They buried Buckley on the edge of the property, near the northern fence line where the sun touched down first every morning. There was no preacher, no prayer. Just the two of them and the dry wind. June read from an old poetry book she found in the sheriff’s things—Yeats, worn at the spine, as dusty as the man had been. When she finished, Cole stepped forward and placed Buckley’s badge atop the headstone they had carved from an old slab of porch wood.

“He kept the door shut as long as he could,” Cole said. “That’s more than most men do.”

The soil didn’t shift.

The sky didn’t darken.

They took that as a sign of peace.

For now.

The town didn’t ask questions when they came back into Garza Ridge. Some people nodded. Some looked away. Some simply watched them pass like they were weather. Cole walked with the weight of it behind his eyes, his gait different, slower, as if he were measuring the world before each step.

The Hollow hadn’t taken him.

But it had marked him.

People could sense it. They didn’t have to say it aloud. It lived in the way the grocery clerk’s hand trembled slightly when handing back change. In the way Mr. Salgado double-locked the door once Cole left the hardware store. In the way the old men on the diner porch stopped telling their stories whenever June walked past, like the air wasn’t safe to fill with words anymore.

She didn’t mind. In fact, she seemed calmer than he’d seen her since her return. It was like something inside her had closed, stitched itself up without scar. She told Cole one night over whiskey and silence that she didn’t dream anymore.

“Not even in pieces?” he asked.

“No,” she said. “And I don’t think that’s a bad thing.”

He believed her.

And envied her.

Because he still dreamed.

He dreamed of long corridors shaped like wounds. Of voices without mouths. Of his own reflection—aging, dying, speaking a name he didn’t remember learning.

He didn’t write them down. He let them rot at the edges of morning.

But every now and then, he’d wake up to find the pouch from Elias burning hot against his chest.

And that was enough reminder.

On the first cool evening of September, Cole stood alone in the field where the mouth had been. Grass had started to return, stubborn and thin. Wildflowers poked through in clumps. The wind moved differently here now. It didn’t carry voices. Just air.

He knelt and pressed a hand to the soil.

It didn’t answer.

It didn’t need to.

What had happened would never be erased. But it could be remembered honestly. Without fear. Without distortion.

He returned to the house and began repairs the next day—fixing the porch first, replacing the wood piece by piece, each nail driven like punctuation in a story that refused to end but could be retold.

June painted while he worked, covering the walls in wide, sweeping shapes. Not symbols. Not eyes. Just light. Color. Landscapes of places they’d never been. Blue skies over unknown fields. Forests that didn’t whisper.

At night, they lit the hearth again, sat together in the flicker, and let the silence be just that—silence. No listening things. No waiting shadows.

The Hollow might come again.

Somewhere.

To someone.

But here, in this moment, they had claimed a piece of land back.

And if that wasn't victory, it was at least something close.

Something human.

Chapter Seven: The Shape of What Remains

Autumn fell gently across Garza Ridge, not with a snap of cold or an early frost, but with slow changes: yellowing leaves curling at the tips, sky settling into a deeper, more thoughtful blue, and the nights growing incrementally quieter. The town moved on, or pretended to. School resumed. Sunday services filled the pews. The sheriff’s office remained closed, but a deputy from the next county took up temporary residence, a man with a stiff gait and nervous eyes. He asked few questions and seemed relieved when none were asked of him.

Cole spent most days working the land. He fixed what could be fixed and let the rest decay on its own terms. The barn was beyond saving, but the north fence stood again, and the pump by the windmill flowed clean water for the first time in years. He didn’t try to do too much at once. Every nail was a kind of ritual. Every board, a form of remembering.

June taught herself how to grow things again. A small garden appeared on the side of the house, at first a patch of brittle greens and wild tomatoes, then squash, peppers, and stubborn sunflowers that grew crooked but bold. She talked to them as she worked, not because she believed they could hear, but because she needed something to speak to that wouldn’t speak back.

There were no signs of the Hollow for weeks.

No dreams.

No strange weather.

No vanishing faces or doubled shadows.

And yet, the memory of it lingered in the architecture of every day. There was a caution to everything. A tenderness born of shared scars. At night, when they lay in bed listening to the coyotes in the distance, June would sometimes reach for Cole’s hand without looking. He always gave it.

Neither of them called it love.

But it was something steadier.

Older.

Rooted in survival, and what followed after.

On the third week of October, a letter arrived.

There was no return address, no stamp. Just a folded piece of paper tucked into the mailbox with no markings. June found it during her morning walk, and they opened it together at the kitchen table.

Inside was a single sentence, handwritten in precise, spidery print:

“You remembered correctly. That was the first mistake.”

Cole stared at the page for a long time. June didn’t speak. She didn’t need to. The words were enough.

It hadn’t forgotten them.

And it hadn’t left.

Later that day, Cole drove into town and walked straight to the library. The building had always felt like a relic—cool, dusty, lined with ancient catalog drawers that no one used anymore. The same librarian sat behind the desk, though he looked thinner now, older in the eyes.

“I need records,” Cole said. “Land deeds. Settler maps. Any documentation from before the Spanish missions.”

The man didn’t ask why. Just gestured toward the basement with a slow nod.

Downstairs, the air smelled like mildew and old pages. Cole sifted through box after box until his fingers were gray with dust. What he found wasn’t much—fragments of land surveys, a few missionary reports, a single black-and-white photograph labeled “La Cuna—1863.”

It showed a hill, a cluster of settlers, and behind them, what appeared to be a structure.

Not a church.

Not a house.

A circle of stone.

No one in the photo faced the camera.

Every head was turned toward the ring.

Cole sat back in the metal chair and tried to breathe evenly. The Hollow wasn’t new. It wasn’t even old in the traditional sense.

It was continual.

A recurrence.

It didn’t emerge randomly.

It returned.

That night, he told June what he found. She listened quietly, hands folded in her lap.

“We always thought it was waiting,” she said. “But maybe it’s not. Maybe it just repeats. Like breath. Like seasons.”

“Then why us?” Cole asked. “Why this time?”

She looked up at him, her eyes calm.

“Because we didn’t look away.”

They sat in silence after that, the fire popping softly in the hearth.

Hours later, Cole woke to the sound of scratching.

He followed it through the hallway, past the living room, and out onto the back porch. The night was clear. Moonless. The kind of darkness that feels heavy.

There, in the dirt just beneath the window, were marks.

Not footprints.

Not claw marks.

Words.

“WE DON’T FORGIVE TRUTH.”

He didn’t wake June.

He erased the marks with his boot and went back inside, heart thudding slow and deep like something beginning to remember how to be afraid.

Days passed.

The house creaked more than usual. Pipes knocked at odd hours. Once, June swore she heard someone breathing inside the hallway walls.

But the earth stayed still.

The wind carried only dust.

And the Hollow made no further attempts.

Cole tried to tell himself that meant something. That it had lost interest. That it had tasted what it needed and moved on.

But he didn’t believe it.

Not really.

Because what they’d done hadn’t been closure.

It had been interruption.

And eventually, the story would resume.

The Hollow was still out there.

Learning.

Changing.

Waiting for the next name.

The next grief.

The next open door.

But for now, the house was quiet.

And sometimes, quiet was enough.

October slipped into November with hardly a protest. The mornings turned crisp. The wind no longer hissed, only whispered in steady tones like an old friend rehearsing apologies it would never give. Cole stood in the pasture one morning with frost on his boots and mist rising from the troughs, and for a few seconds, it felt like the world was back to its right shape. The fence posts held. The crows kept to the trees. The air didn’t taste like iron or ozone. But he knew better than to believe in the surface of things.

He had started writing again—not in any structured way, but in notebooks, on napkins, across the backs of receipts. Bits of thoughts. Questions. Patterns he couldn’t quite shake. Most of it he burned after rereading. Some of it he left scattered through the house like breadcrumbs for a version of himself he might forget one day. Not as a warning. As a tether.

June kept busy. She had taken to walking into town every Thursday morning, a canvas bag slung over one shoulder, filled with vegetables, bread, jars of pickled onions she’d preserved herself. She visited the diner, sat quietly at a corner table with a worn paperback, and waited. Not for anyone, not for anything specific. She waited to be seen. To be remembered by a town that had nearly given itself away.

The waitress—Marlene—had started refilling her coffee without being asked. A small kindness, but a real one.

One Thursday, she returned with something new in her bag. A letter, this time in a proper envelope. No postmark. No return address. Just a short note inside, typed, on paper yellowed at the corners.

“The soil here has memory. You can bury the body. But the shape remains. What you pulled from the well was not water.”

She didn’t show it to Cole right away.

Instead, she placed it in a drawer beside her bed and waited three days. Then, one morning, while he worked outside, she quietly set it on the kitchen table and left it for him to find.

He read it with his hands flat against the table, as if grounding himself could stop the words from crawling.

“They’re not threatening us anymore,” he said when she came in from the garden.

“No.”

“They’re observing.”

“Yes,” June said. “And we’re responding.”

Cole exhaled slowly. “How long can we do that?”

She met his eyes. “As long as it takes.”

They began digging in the north field two days later. Not for fear, not for defense. For understanding. The Hollow was not an entity they could confront again as they had before. Its language wasn’t confrontation—it was invitation. Seduction. Echo.

So they looked for its roots.

They dug wide, shallow trenches in places where the grass grew poorly or not at all. They used old maps, dowsing rods, and once, just instinct. What they found wasn’t obvious. Not bones. Not artifacts. Just impressions in the rock—circular patterns, too symmetrical to be natural, as if something old and vast had rested there for a time and then moved on, leaving a crater in memory.

And near the largest depression, June found a charm buried just under the surface: a thin ring of copper, carved with words she couldn’t read. She held it in her palm for nearly ten minutes before speaking.

“I wore one like this once,” she said. “When I was young. My grandmother said it was for protection.”

“Did it work?” Cole asked.

She didn’t answer.

He took the ring from her gently and placed it inside an empty matchbox.

By the time the first frost came in earnest, Cole had mapped twelve separate rings on the property. Some were as wide as barns. Some no larger than a dining table. None were visible above ground until they started digging. He marked each one with iron stakes and tied strips of red cloth around them. A warning. A ritual. A declaration: we see you now.

June began waking at the same time every night—3:14 a.m.—without fail. She said she didn’t feel afraid. Only attentive. Like something had been placed inside her and was stirring to the rhythm of something far below.

She started drawing again.

Not landscapes this time, but spirals.

Each one slightly different. Each one signed, oddly, in the bottom right corner—not with her name, but with a small symbol: an open eye with no iris.

Cole asked about it once.

“I see it,” she said. “So it sees me.”

He didn’t press her.

They kept the drawings in a wooden chest in the attic. Not hidden, but not displayed. Neither of them wanted to pretend they were art. They were signals. Markers. Like smoke rising from something that still burned, miles underground.

One night, a storm rolled over the ridge. It wasn’t a natural one. No rain. No lightning. Just wind and sound—deep, resonant pressure that made the floorboards creak and the windows sweat. June didn’t wake this time. Cole sat alone in the living room with a rifle across his knees and the fire slowly dying in the grate. He didn’t expect the gun to matter. It was the act of readiness that counted.

Then came the whisper.

Not from the walls. Not from the air.

From within him.

A voice, soft and unhurried, curling against the back of his skull.

“You can’t unremember us. But you can become us.”

He closed his eyes, let the words pass through like wind through grass, and whispered back:

“No. You can only feed on fear. And I’m not hungry anymore.”

The silence that followed felt like retreat.

Or perhaps respect.

By dawn, the storm had gone.

June made coffee and whistled a tune neither of them recognized.

In the weeks that followed, they stopped speaking about the Hollow directly. Not out of denial, but balance. It had taken so much. It had demanded so much. Giving it their voices would only strengthen it. So they lived. Quietly. Deliberately. They fixed what broke. They tended what grew.

And in the process, they built something the Hollow couldn’t mimic.

A place rooted not in terror, but in truth.

And when winter came, they lit candles in the windows.

Not for guidance.

Not for warning.

But as a promise.

To themselves.

And to whatever still listened beneath the dirt.

The first real snow fell in mid-December, just past midnight. Cole had been sitting on the porch, coat zipped to the chin, hands wrapped around a chipped enamel mug of black coffee gone cold. He watched the flakes drift like ash, soft and quiet, layering the porch boards, collecting in the crevices of the rocking chair June refused to sit in anymore.

Inside, the fire cracked gently. June slept soundly in the room at the back of the house, surrounded by hand-drawn spirals and quiet windows. She hadn’t stirred in hours. That was rare now. Since the storm weeks earlier, her sleep had grown deeper, more settled. She said she didn’t dream—not in pictures or voices—but in sensations, like memory experienced through skin. A heartbeat. A hand on the back of her neck. The smell of cedar in smoke. She never woke frightened anymore. But she did wake changed.

Cole found himself cataloging changes—not just in June, not just in the land, but in himself. He no longer flinched when shadows moved. He no longer tensed at the sound of wind. Fear had become a distant cousin to responsibility. He wasn’t waiting for something to happen. He was waiting for what he would do when it did.

Because something always did.

And he knew the Hollow hadn’t given up.

It had simply retreated.

Recalibrated.

The snow deepened. He watched it without blinking. For a long while, it reminded him of peace. Then he saw the footprints.

Small. Bare. Human.

Coming from the edge of the field. Stopping ten feet from the porch. Then vanishing. No sign of where the figure had gone. No backward trail.

Just a single line of prints that ended like the person had dissolved into air.

He stood.

Walked slowly across the porch.

Stopped at the edge.

The snow had stopped falling. The sky was black and slick, holding too many stars. The air felt hollowed, as if someone had scooped the warmth out of it and left the rest hanging.

Cole didn’t call out.

He went back inside.

June found the prints the next morning. Cole had hoped the snow would bury them, that the night had been playing tricks with shape and light. But there they were—clear and unbroken, leading from nowhere to nothing.

She stood above them in silence.

“They stopped coming to the house,” she said, half to herself.

He watched her closely. “You think this one got farther than the rest?”

“No,” she said, bending to touch one of the prints with her gloved hand. “I think this one came from the house.”

Cole frowned. “That’s not possible.”

June didn’t argue.

They checked every door. Every window. They found no signs of forced entry, no footprints inside, no broken locks or opened latches. But on the floor beneath the kitchen sink—pressed lightly into the dust—was a small bare footprint. Smaller than either of theirs. Fresh.

June stared at it, then sat down hard on the floor. Her eyes looked older than they had the night before.

“Maybe it’s not trying to haunt us anymore,” she said. “Maybe it’s trying to become us.”

Cole knelt beside her. “It can’t do that. Not fully. We know too much. We’ve seen it. We changed it.”

June shook her head. “It changes too, Cole. That’s the part we keep forgetting. It watches. It learns.”

He didn’t reply.

Because he knew she was right.

That night, they gathered the drawings from the attic. All the spirals. All the markings. They brought them into the living room and laid them across the floor. There were over seventy now. No two alike. Some were tight and symmetrical. Others were jagged and spoked, drawn with the kind of pressure that split paper.

“I don’t remember half of these,” June said softly.

“They look like maps,” Cole said.

She nodded. “But not of geography.”

“Then what?”

“Of process,” she said. “Of becoming. These aren’t messages. They’re diagrams.”

Cole pointed to one in particular—a spiral that opened outward, then bent sharply into a double helix before vanishing into a blackened corner.

“That one was under the sink,” he said.

June looked at him.

They burned it first.

Then the others.

Not all at once, not in panic, but one at a time, fed into the fireplace like letters to someone you loved too long. June murmured something over each page, not quite words, not quite prayer. By the time the last one crumbled into ash, the snow had started falling again.

This time, it melted when it hit the windows.

In the days that followed, the air shifted.

The house felt lighter. No more knocking from the pipes. No more voices in the walls. The lights no longer flickered. The animals returned to the edge of the woods. Even the soil, where the buried circles had been, seemed to accept the thaw.

But Cole remained alert.

So did June.

They weren’t waiting for a new emergence.

They were preparing for recognition.

If the Hollow had tried to become them, it would try again. But next time, it would wear a better face. One closer to home.

And they needed to be ready.

Not just to defend the land.

But to protect the world from them.

Because you can only carry the shape of a thing for so long before it reshapes you in return.

And some echoes don't fade.

They find new throats.

New names.

New doors.

So every morning, Cole walked the edge of the field with a blade of iron in his pocket, tracing new boundaries in the dirt.

And June, just before bed each night, drew a single symbol on the inside of the front door.

Not a spiral.

A closed circle.

No breaks.

No mouths.

A promise.

Chapter Eight: What Cannot Be Buried

By the time the new year slid into being—without ceremony, without noise—Garza Ridge had entered a state of uneasy calm. There were no parades. No fireworks. The town didn’t seem to register the turning of the calendar at all. It was as if the year had passed not in time, but in distance, and now they had arrived at a place only faintly resembling what had come before.

Cole and June stayed close to the ranch. The snow receded with a reluctant grace, and though they never said it aloud, both of them understood: winter had been a blessing. It muffled what should not speak. It dulled the senses of the thing that watched from below. But spring would change that. Growth brought attention. With warmth would come sound. With blossoms, memory. The Hollow fed on all of it.

They had taken precautions. The perimeter of the property was now lined with small totems—iron, bone, ash—each bound with twine and soaked in salt. Some came from Elias Varn’s notes. Some from June’s dreams. Others they made up themselves, not because they believed in superstition, but because superstition had started believing in them.

And still, the air shifted.

It always did before something arrived.

The first sign came in the form of silence.

One morning in February, Cole rose before dawn and opened the front door to find the world without sound. No wind. No birds. No creak of the old boards beneath his boots. Even his breath seemed muted, absorbed into the stillness like it was never meant to be heard. He stood there a moment, eyes scanning the treeline, heart waiting to tell him if he should run or kneel.

Then he saw it.

A figure, standing just beyond the farthest fencepost, where the north pasture fell away into brush and shadow.

Not moving.

Not waving.

Just watching.

June appeared beside him without a word. She had wrapped herself in a shawl and held a mug of tea in both hands, as though she'd already known what he would see.

“How long has it been standing there?” he asked.

“Since before I woke up.”

He looked at her, but her eyes remained fixed on the figure.

“Do you recognize it?”

“Not its shape,” she said. “But its posture. That’s the shape of waiting.”

Cole squinted against the morning gloom. The figure looked like a man, or the idea of one. Tall, thin, indistinct at the edges, like it was built from smoke and memory. It didn’t wear a coat, but didn’t seem cold. Didn’t sway in the wind, because there wasn’t any.

“I’ll go down there,” he said.

“No,” June said, firmly. “That’s what it wants. To set the rhythm. To start the story on its terms.”

He closed the door.

The silence held.

By midday, the figure was gone.

No footprints in the snow.

No impression in the soil.

Just the memory of watching.

Cole and June didn’t speak of it directly. They spent the rest of the day cleaning tools in the barn, oiling hinges, tightening bolts that didn’t need tightening. June hummed to herself—low and tuneless, but grounding. The kind of sound you make when you need to know you still have a voice.

That night, Cole checked every boundary marker. All were still in place.

But when he returned to the porch, he found something hanging from the door handle.

A pinecone, dipped in wax, tied with a strip of cloth.

It wasn’t one of theirs.

He held it for a long moment, then placed it in the fireplace without a word.

The next dream came to June.

She didn’t tell Cole right away. It took her three days to even write it down. But when she did, the words were spare. Shaky.

    I stood in the well.
    But there was no water.
    Only roots.
    They grew into my hands.
    And I didn’t bleed.
    I just forgot.

She left the page folded on the kitchen table. Cole read it before sunrise and stared out the window for a long time, watching the fog roll low across the grass.

“Then we need to remember louder than it can forget,” he whispered.

They started building something.

Not a wall. Not a weapon.

A room.

They cleared out the old grain shed, reinforced the foundation, lined the interior with mirrors faced inward. Each mirror had a symbol carved into its surface—some from the journals, others drawn by hand under candlelight. They filled the space with sound: wind chimes made from broken cutlery, old radios tuned to static, a cassette player playing loops of wind, laughter, cicadas.

It was a chamber of disruption.

Of things the Hollow couldn’t smooth into silence.

They called it the Anchor Room.

Every night, one of them sat inside while the other stood watch.

They didn’t know if it helped.

But nothing came through during those nights.

And for them, that was enough.

One evening in late February, June found a book on the front porch.

Wrapped in cloth. Bound in dark leather. No title.

Inside: drawings. Spirals. Mouths. A list of names.

Some they didn’t recognize.

One they did.

Clara Maddox.

June ran her fingers down the page, eyes hollow.

“She was never mine,” she said. “But she knows me.”

Cole took the book gently and read the inscription on the final page:

    Memory is not a chain.
    It is a corridor.
    And all doors swing inward.

He looked at June.

“We’re not closing the door, are we?” he asked.

She shook her head.

“We’re becoming one.”

Not with the Hollow.

But with its opposite.

With resistance.

With clarity.

With the remembering of truth.

Even when it hurt.

Especially then.

Because forgetting was what the Hollow wanted.

And they had built their house from something else entirely.

Something it couldn’t mimic.

A choice.

The first time they stepped into the Anchor Room together, it was past midnight. The wind had picked up again outside—strong enough to whistle through the slats of the fence, but not enough to shake the house. They had waited for the storm, knowing storms carried sound, and that sound could reveal more than silence ever would.

Inside, the room was cold but not unpleasant. It felt clean. Sparse. Each mirror reflected the other, a closed feedback loop of image and shadow. The chimes hung motionless from the ceiling, their stillness creating a tension in the air, like the room was listening—aware, not malicious, but deeply awake.

Cole stood in the center while June lit the last of the candles and sat on the single stool they’d placed by the door. The cassette player was already running. A loop of noises they’d recorded over the course of weeks: footsteps in gravel, doors creaking open, a child’s laugh (accidental, overheard from a passing car), snippets of radio static, the low tremor of distant thunder.

“What are you thinking?” June asked.

Cole didn’t answer right away. He turned slowly, watching the reflections bounce across glass, noting the delay between movement and image. It was subtle—barely there—but enough to notice. The mirrors didn’t show them exactly as they were.

“They’re too slow,” he said. “Like they’re waiting to see who we decide to be before they commit to copying us.”

June tapped her fingers on her knee. “Is that what this is now? Us... versus a mirror?”

“It’s always been a mirror,” Cole replied. “We just didn’t realize the image was looking back.”

She nodded and reached for the journal where she had started sketching new shapes. Not spirals anymore. Not even circles. But fractures. Lines that bent and broke and started again in different directions. She had begun calling them continuations.

“No more loops,” she said. “Only paths.”

They stayed in the room until the candle burned low and the static loop began to fray, the tape warping. The silence that followed was thicker than before—but clean, like something had passed through and decided not to stay.

In early March, a bird struck the window of the kitchen.

It wasn’t unusual in itself. Birds hit glass all the time. But this one didn’t fall.

It stayed there.

Pressed flat against the pane, wings spread like a crucifixion.

Its eyes were wide open. Unblinking.

June found it first.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t flinch.

She walked to the window, pressed her palm against the glass beside the bird’s head, and whispered, “We don’t speak your name anymore.”

The bird fell.

They buried it in the garden beneath the cold frame. Neither of them said a word.

But that night, the mirrors in the Anchor Room fogged for the first time.

Not from breath.

But from presence.

The next morning, Cole awoke to a familiar sound—one that hadn’t touched his ears in months.

Whistling.

Low and steady.

Coming from beneath the floorboards.

He followed it into the basement. There, in the far corner, was the old root cellar hatch they hadn’t opened since the last collapse. The wood was warped, but intact. He placed a hand on it.

Stillness.

Then the whistling again—this time behind him.

He turned.

Nothing there.

But on the concrete wall, someone—or something—had etched a phrase into the chalk dust with a single, dragging finger:

“You can bury a voice, but not a song.”

He scraped it clean. Covered the wall with paint. Sealed the hatch again.

Then went upstairs and turned on every light in the house.

Later, they began building a second room.

Not a sanctuary this time.

An archive.

They filled it with copies—photographs of their lives before the Hollow, cassette recordings of conversations, letters, family names written over and over on loose pages. They called it “The Room of True Things.” Nothing that went in could be false. No memory distorted. No document left blank.

It became a habit. A ritual.

Before bed, they each added something.

One night, June wrote down the first recipe her grandmother taught her. Cornbread and molasses with sweet milk on the side.

The next night, Cole left a scrap of flannel from his father’s old hunting jacket. It smelled of tobacco and rain.

These small truths became bricks in a wall they couldn’t see but could feel—a defense not made of fire or salt or iron, but of remembrance.

Real, grounded memory was what the Hollow couldn’t digest.

Not fully.

Not yet.

Then, in late March, a letter came.

Different this time.

Typed. Neatly folded. Delivered to the mailbox like any other.

But the envelope was sealed in wax.

And the wax bore no stamp.

Just a circle.

Unbroken.

Inside, a single line:

“We no longer seek your fear. We seek your attention.”

It was signed:

—Clara

Cole folded the paper and placed it in the fire. The flame caught quickly. The wax seal melted into a thin line of blood-colored smoke.

He didn’t tell June about the signature.

Not that day.

He waited until she stood in the garden again, watching the new shoots rise from the soil.

“She’s not done,” he said softly.

June didn’t turn. “I know.”

“We might have to go back. Not to the Hollow. To its echo.”

She nodded once. “The reflection.”

He swallowed. “What do we do when we find her?”

“Speak truth,” she said. “Louder than memory. Louder than the mirror.”

They watched the sun fall behind the trees, long shadows stretching across the dirt like fingers reaching backward.

“Can you do that?” she asked.

“I don’t know,” Cole said. “But I’ll try.”

And June smiled—small and tired, but real.

“Then she’ll hear us,” she said. “Eventually.”

And somewhere—far below, or very close—something listened.

And did not reply.

Chapter Nine: The Second Reflection

April arrived without fanfare—no blooming all at once, no sudden warmth. Just the slow drip of thaw and return. The creeks loosened. The soil softened. Grass came back in fragile patches. Animals emerged, but cautiously. Everything seemed aware that winter had buried more than ice.

Cole and June had stopped pretending to sleep through the nights. They slept in shifts now, one always half-awake, listening. Not for footsteps or voices, but for movement—the subtle rearranging of the familiar that signaled something was beginning again.

It was June who found the mirror.

Not in the house.

Not buried.

In the woods.

Hung from a tree branch, swinging lightly in the morning breeze, twenty feet from the property line. No footprints led to it. No trail. The branch itself had been stripped of bark. A length of wire held the mirror in place, its glass clean, reflecting not the forest, but a white corridor that shimmered like wet paint.

She didn’t touch it.

Just turned and walked back to the house.

By the time Cole arrived with her, it was gone.

Only the wire remained, twisted into the shape of a closed eye.

They called Elias.

He answered on the second ring. His voice had changed—rougher, more worn, like gravel dragged across a hardwood floor.

“It’s happening again,” Cole said.

“I figured it would,” Elias replied. “When something learns how to look like you, it doesn’t go away. It waits until you forget your own face.”

“We haven’t,” June said, leaning into the phone.

“You’re not the ones I’m worried about.”

There was a pause.

Then Elias said, “There’s a place I need you to see. It’s not far from where the first well opened. A little hollow west of Arroyo Bend. They sealed it years ago with concrete. The locals call it a foundation pit. But it’s not.”

“What is it?” Cole asked.

“A training ground,” Elias said. “For whatever comes next.”

They left the next morning.

Drove west across the high plains, the sky wide and blank as a mirror turned backward. June sat quietly, arms folded over her chest, the copper charm she'd once buried now hanging from a chain around her neck. Neither of them spoke much. The road hummed beneath them like a thought they couldn’t finish.

Arroyo Bend was smaller than Garza Ridge. A few gas stations, an abandoned feed store, and a town square that hadn’t been square for decades. They didn’t stop. Just followed the old mining road west, past fences long rusted through, past signs half-swallowed by weeds.

They found the pit just before dusk.

It was exactly as Elias had said—circular, sealed with thick slabs of poured concrete, edges chipped by weather and time. Grass didn’t grow here. No insects buzzed. The air held still.

June stood at the edge and frowned. “It feels like a rehearsal.”

Cole nodded. “Like a stage no one cleaned up after the show.”

They circled it once, twice.

Then Cole saw it.

A small hatch. Metal. Bolted into the concrete at the western edge.

It shouldn’t have been there.

But it was.

He dropped to his knees, brushed away dust and moss, and found a set of carvings beneath the grime.

Not letters.

Just symbols.

Spirals.

Eyes.

And one shape that mirrored the charm June wore—an open loop, unbroken.

He sat back.

“It’s not just watching,” he said. “It’s preparing.”

“For what?” she asked.

Cole looked at her, and for a moment, his face wasn’t afraid—but tired in a way she’d never seen.

“For when we’re no longer here to remember.”

They opened the hatch that night.

Elias had warned them not to enter. He’d said, “Let sleepers dream their own endings.” But the air was too still. The silence too practiced. They had to see.

Inside, the stairs curved downward in a tight spiral, carved directly into stone. No railings. No power. Just a cold draft that carried with it the scent of paper and rust.

They descended together, flashlights steady, hands close.

The stairwell opened into a chamber—smaller than the last Hollow, but disturbingly familiar. Mirrors lined the walls, but they didn’t reflect light. Only motion. Cole stepped past one, and it showed him reaching backward instead of forward. June stared into another and saw her childhood bedroom, slowly filling with water.

At the far end of the chamber was a table.

On it, a book.

Leather-bound. Unmarked.

Cole opened it.

Inside: names.

Hundreds of them.

Dates. Places.

And beside one name, underlined in red ink:

Maddox, Clara – Reentry Confirmed.

He closed the book and backed away.

June’s face had gone pale.

“Clara was never just a projection,” she said. “She was a seed.”

“Planted through us,” Cole added. “And now it’s sprouting.”

They didn’t speak after that.

They climbed the stairs in silence.

When they emerged, the wind had picked up.

And the hatch door refused to close.

They returned to Garza Ridge in three days’ time. The drive was slower. Not because of roads or weather, but because each mile brought with it a question they couldn’t ask.

Back home, everything was where they left it.

The Anchor Room was intact.

The garden had begun to bloom.

But a letter sat on the kitchen table.

Unmarked.

Inside, a single line, typed in familiar font:

“When the mirror forgets who it’s copying, it begins to reflect possibility.”

June folded the paper carefully.

And for the first time in weeks, she smiled.

Not from relief.

From understanding.

“Then we choose what it sees,” she said.

And together, they stepped into the light of their home.

Not ready.

But willing.

Because the Hollow didn’t feed only on fear.

It fed on abandonment.

And as long as they remained, it would never dine in peace.

The days that followed their return from Arroyo Bend passed with a new kind of clarity. Not calm—because nothing was truly still anymore—but focused. There were no more illusions about survival as an end point. They now understood what they were participating in: not a war, but a stewardship. A long, winding process of tending memory like a field, keeping it from being overrun by the vines of forgetting.

June resumed work in the garden. But this time she planted nothing edible. Flowers only—strong, fragrant things that bloomed in defiance: marigolds, sage, and bitter calendula. The scent of them drifted through the open windows, masking the smell of dust and old paper that had taken root in the house. Cole watched her one morning, the hem of her jeans muddy, her hands dark with soil, and felt something rare spark in his chest—not happiness, not safety, but recognition.

This was what the Hollow could never understand.

This was what it could never copy.

Love grounded in presence, not ideal.

He went inside and retrieved the book they’d taken from the pit—the one with Clara’s name inside. He hadn’t opened it since that night. It still smelled faintly of damp stone. He laid it open on the table and began to read, slowly this time.

The names weren’t in order.

They weren’t listed alphabetically or by date.

But after several pages, a pattern emerged—not in the names themselves, but in the locations. Each one corresponded with known sites: wells, caves, collapsed homes, ghost towns. Places where something had opened and never quite closed.

But scattered among them were notes.

Not typed.

Written in pencil, fine and slanted:

    “This one refused.”
    “Two hosts unsuccessful.”
    “Memory collapse observed.”
    “Surrogate viable.”
    “Lineage carries reentry.”

He turned the page and froze.

Under Clara’s name, another note had been added since they last saw it.

    “Observation terminated. Reassigned to host: J. Maddox.”

Cole stood abruptly, the chair scraping backward.

He found June by the fence, hands gloved, a row of new stones arranged like sentinels around her flower beds.

“June,” he called, his voice tighter than he intended.

She turned, wiping her forehead. “I felt it.”

“You’ve been reassigned,” he said.

She didn’t ask by what.

She already knew.

That night, they sat on the porch together, wrapped in blankets, a thermos of hot tea between them. The moon rose early, thin and sharp. A coyote called once from far off, but nothing answered it.

June leaned her head against his shoulder.

“It’s not possession,” she said. “It’s not that simple.”

“No,” Cole replied. “It’s inheritance.”

“Then I’ll rewrite the will.”

He smiled despite the weight in his gut.

She was still June.

Not a copy.

Not yet.

But he felt something pushing now. A pressure at the corners of her words, in the angles of her movements. Like something was trying to edit her.

They went back into the Anchor Room on the third night.

Cole brought a mirror from his childhood bedroom. June brought an old Polaroid of her mother. They placed both objects in the center of the room, then stood opposite each other as the static tape looped behind them.

“Do you feel her?” Cole asked.

June nodded. “But not in me. Next to me. Like a twin in another room.”

Cole stepped closer. “We can’t let it in.”

“I know,” she said. “But I also can’t force it out. If I fight it, it adapts. If I ignore it, it waits.”

“Then what?”

June’s eyes flicked to the mirror, now fogging slightly.

“I have to talk to her.”

Cole started to object. Then stopped.

Because he understood.

Clara wasn’t just a vessel or memory.

She was a story left untold.

And the Hollow had grown in that absence.

June sat on the stool in the room’s center, eyes fixed on the fogging mirror.

“If you’re here,” she said softly, “you already know what I am.”

The mirror cleared.

And for a moment, it didn’t reflect the room.

It showed a desert, a fire, a girl walking backward into the dark.

Then—her face.

June’s face.

But younger.

Afraid.

And smiling.

“You want me to be what you were,” June whispered. “But I’m not.”

The reflection nodded.

June leaned forward.

“You’re not unfinished. You’re misunderstood.”

A crack split across the mirror. Not shattering—relieving. Like tension giving way to truth.

Cole reached for her hand.

The reflection mouthed something neither of them could hear.

Then it vanished.

They returned to the house at dawn.

The windows were untouched.

No letters on the table.

No mirrors hanging in the trees.

But in the center of the kitchen floor, laid out like a shrine, was a photograph.

Black and white. Faded at the edges.

It showed a child standing in the center of a field.

Behind her: four figures. Vague. Watching.

Below the image, a name:

JUNIA MADDIX — 1902

Not a misprint.

A reminder.

June picked up the photo and studied it for a long time.

“She was the first,” she said. “Not Clara.”

Cole rubbed his face. “The Hollow doesn’t come through people. It comes through stories. That’s why it doesn’t stop. We’ve been naming the wrong origins.”

June folded the photo and placed it in the archive room.

When she emerged, she held a piece of charcoal and approached the front door.

This time, she drew not a closed circle.

But a line.

Curved once.

Then broken.

Then curving again.

An unfinished spiral.

“What is it?” Cole asked.

“A choice,” she said.

And behind them, the house settled into itself with a long, slow breath.

Because the Hollow hadn’t vanished.

But it had begun to listen.

By mid-April, the ground was too warm for frost, and the first green shoots in the garden stood with cautious defiance. June woke every morning with soil beneath her fingernails and a new name on her tongue. Most she didn’t speak aloud—only wrote them down on strips of brown paper she folded and tucked into the seams of the porch. Names from dreams. Names never mentioned in any book, but so certain, so clearly remembered, that Cole never questioned them.

Cole spent those weeks reworking the southern field. It was fallow now, but that was fine. He wasn’t planting. He was shaping. Marking. Setting iron stakes into the earth at measured intervals, burying brass rings between layers of gravel and ash. Each point formed a new geometry—an open spiral, unfinished. It wasn’t for protection. It wasn’t a trap. It was a conversation. Something the Hollow could see and not immediately consume.

On the eleventh day, June stood at the edge of the field as he worked.

“You’re not building a fence,” she said.

“No,” he replied. “I’m building a sentence.”

She raised an eyebrow.

“One it can’t interrupt.”

June didn’t ask what the sentence said. Maybe she already knew. Or maybe it wasn’t for her. Maybe it was only for the Hollow, a thread in the dark that led back to meaning.

One afternoon, June brought out a folded page from the archive room—something she had nearly thrown away.

A partial letter. Burned at the edges. Written in child’s handwriting.

    “My name isn’t real, but you keep calling me.
    I want to go home.
    You told me the mouth was a game.
    You told me the circle was safe.
    But I remember the walls. I remember the not-sky.
    I remember you forgot me on purpose.”

There was no name at the bottom.

No clue who it had been addressed to.

June set it on the table.

“This isn’t about what the Hollow wants,” she said. “It’s about what it’s mourning.”

Cole looked up from the edge of his notebook. “A child?”

“Maybe more than one,” she replied. “Maybe all of them.”

The Hollow wasn’t a single voice. That was the mistake everyone made—believing it to be a creature, a deity, even a metaphor. It wasn’t singular.

It was congregational.

It was grief made communal. Repetition without resolution. The endless recycling of the unspoken.

“What happens,” Cole said slowly, “when it learns to forgive?”

June looked toward the field.

“It forgets.”

He shook his head. “No. Not forget. Heal.”

That night, the Anchor Room trembled.

They had reinforced the structure with stone and buried nails, but the sound came from beneath—a low, hollow knock like a child tapping on the underside of a table.

Cole went inside first. June followed.

The cassette player was still running. But the tape was playing backward. Not rewinding—playing. As if time had flipped inside the room.

And in the center of the floor was a single object.

A child’s shoe.

Worn.

Muddied.

Burned at the toe.

June didn’t touch it.

Cole walked a slow circle around it, flashlight beam steady.

“It’s not a threat,” June said. “It’s a reply.”

He nodded. “It wants to know if it’s remembered.”

June stepped forward. Picked up the shoe carefully. Held it against her chest like a stone pulled from a fire.

“I remember,” she whispered. “I remember you.”

The lights in the room flickered.

The mirrors cleared.

And one by one, each chime let out a single, pure note.

The following day, Cole buried the shoe at the center of the unfinished spiral in the southern field.

He didn’t mark the grave.

June watched from the porch, eyes unreadable.

That night, they dreamed the same dream.

They were children again, sitting on opposite ends of a dry well. Across from them, seated in the dirt, were dozens of figures—young, old, in-between. All facing inward. None speaking.

And above them: stars arranged in spirals, shifting slowly into a new shape.

When Cole woke, he found a message carved into the condensation on the window.

“Memory made right becomes place.”

A week later, the earth opened again.

Not violently.

Not even visibly.

It was a feeling. A shift.

One morning, June walked to the center of the garden and found herself below. Not physically—but her mind, her sense, had dipped beneath her feet. She knelt and pressed her hands to the dirt and felt it vibrating—not danger, but invitation.

She dug, slowly.

Three inches down, she found an old photo. Torn, soaked, barely holding form.

But she recognized it.

Clara.

Smiling.

Holding a child.

A note written on the back in faded pencil:

    “She gave me a new name. It held.”

June stared at it for a long time before handing it to Cole.

“She didn’t fail,” she said. “She finished her story. Just not here.”

Cole looked toward the field.

“So that’s what the Hollow wants now. Not a host. A storyteller.”

June nodded. “We’re not the ending. We’re the archivists.”

They lit candles that night.

Not for protection.

For presence.

And in the Anchor Room, they placed a new mirror—one not angled inward, but outward, toward the open door.

Above it, they hung a simple sign:

WELCOME, BUT NOT EMPTY

Because they were no longer sealing the Hollow out.

They were giving it a place.

Not to consume.

But to rest.

Because everything—even the endless—wants somewhere to end.

Even if it never quite gets there.

Chapter Ten: What We Build When Watched

The heat came early that year. By May, the air in Garza Ridge hung thick with the smell of sagebrush and rising dust. The ground cracked underfoot like old paper. Coyotes grew bolder, lingering on the ridge at dusk. The town moved slower, as if bracing itself—not for heatstroke or drought, but something subtler. A reckoning in the soil.

June had stopped keeping track of the days.

Instead, she measured time by how long it took for certain flowers to bloom, how quickly the hummingbirds returned, how deep the roots reached before they turned white and brittle. She stopped journaling. Her memory didn’t need anchors anymore. It had become part of the field, the house, the very air inside the Anchor Room. She didn’t forget, because now the place remembered for her.

Cole spent more time in silence. Not brooding. Listening. He walked the new paths through the south and east fields each morning, boots leaving barely a trace in the dust. Sometimes he walked until dusk, circling the unmarked graves, touching the red-flagged posts that indicated where old things had once surfaced: bones, brass, cracked porcelain dolls.

The Hollow didn’t speak anymore.

Not through mirrors.

Not through dreams.

Instead, it watched.

Not with malice.

With something closer to... reverence.

On a Wednesday with no wind, Cole found a door.

Not a real one. A frame. Upright, nailed together from pale driftwood, freestanding in the center of the field where he had buried the child’s shoe weeks before. It hadn’t been there the day before. He would have noticed.

No hinges. No knob. Just an empty rectangle, warped and sun-bleached, buzzing faintly when approached.

He didn’t touch it.

He called June.

She came quickly. Stood five feet away from the frame and tilted her head slightly, watching it like a hawk watches a branch for movement.

“It’s not an entrance,” she said. “It’s a choice.”

“For what?”

She didn’t answer immediately. Then:

“For continuation.”

That night, June returned alone.

Cole didn’t try to follow. They’d agreed—some things had to be faced without echo.

She stepped through the doorframe without pause. And nothing happened.

No light. No transport. No collapse.

Only a slight shift in sound. The wind stopped for a moment. The earth held its breath. Then resumed.

She stood on the other side and looked back.

Everything was the same.

And not.

Colors sharper. Air heavier.

Like standing inside a painting made of her own thoughts.

She knelt.

Touched the dirt.

And it responded.

A warmth moved through her fingers, like water soaked in grief.

Then she spoke.

“I accept the stories you carry.”

The wind returned.

The doorframe shuddered.

And then, June forgot.

Not her name.

Not Cole.

But her pain.

The precise edges of it.

The shape that had defined her for so long began to dissolve—not vanish, not be erased, but loosen, like bark from an old tree.

She stood, eyes glassy, and stepped back through.

Cole caught her when she stumbled, his hands steady.

“Did it speak?” he asked.

“No,” she said, voice distant. “But it agreed.”

Over the following days, visitors began arriving at the edge of the property.

Not townsfolk.

Not strangers.

People who knew.

Some came alone. Some in pairs. All quiet. All wide-eyed.

They stood at the southern field and waited.

Cole let them in.

June offered water, sometimes a warm place to rest. She didn’t ask questions. She didn’t have to.

They were drawn by the signal—the spiral of names remembered, of stories told completely. The Hollow had stopped consuming because the need to consume had been addressed. No longer starved of endings, it had become a place that received rather than devoured.

And the visitors—each of them carried something buried. A name. A guilt. A loss so sharp it had split their lives in two.

Here, they spoke.

In low voices.

At dusk.

In the Anchor Room or out beneath the crooked sycamore behind the garden.

And the Hollow listened.

And it did not reply.

Because listening was enough.

Cole started writing again. Longhand. Journals, notebooks, scraps of paper tucked beneath floorboards.

But he didn’t write about the Hollow.

He wrote about people.

He wrote Clara’s story—beginning with her first dream, ending with the day June stepped through the door.

He wrote about Buckley and his coffee habit, the way he’d once stitched a snakebite shut on his own leg while humming old hymnals.

He wrote about his father’s hands—cracked and hard, but always careful when petting the dog.

And he wrote about June.

How she’d returned without fury.

How she’d accepted the burden of remembering and transformed it into a practice.

Not healing, not exactly.

But clarity.

Truth left intact.

The doorframe remained.

Visitors came and went.

None stayed long.

They didn’t need to.

They left things behind—drawings, names carved into stones, small bundles of hair or teeth or ash. All offered freely. All accepted by the place.

And the Hollow grew quieter.

Not smaller.

Just more complete.

Like a wound that no longer opened.

But still ached when the wind shifted.

One evening, June walked into the field alone.

Cole watched her from the porch, hand resting loosely on the armrest.

She stepped through the door.

Paused.

Then turned to face it.

And closed her eyes.

“I am not afraid of you,” she said.

“I am not you.”

“I am not what was lost.”

“I am what remembers.”

And the doorframe trembled, just slightly.

As if grateful.

That night, a new star appeared over the ridge.

Small. Steady. Red-gold.

It hadn’t been there before.

None of the visitors saw it.

But June did.

And so did Cole.

And neither of them spoke of it aloud.

Because some truths aren’t meant to be shared.

Only held.

Like the name of a thing that once devoured you, but now simply rests beside your fire.

Waiting for the next story.

The next voice.

The next chapter.

The land shifted again in late May—not violently, but permanently. It was in the way shadows lingered longer than they should. How the trees stopped rustling even when wind pressed against them. How the dirt underfoot sometimes gave with the soft reluctance of breath. June called it “the lean.” The Hollow no longer lived beneath the land. It lived through it—woven into the fibers of root and stone like a song retuned to a quieter key.

They didn’t resist it.

Not anymore.

Because it wasn’t asking for control now. It wasn’t baiting them with loss or illusions. It was waiting for shape.

Waiting for structure.

The Hollow wanted to learn from them.

So they taught.

Not with lectures or rituals, but with repetition. June began holding quiet circles every third night. Visitors would sit in the Anchor Room—no more than four at a time—and speak the names they’d never said aloud. Not shouted. Not cried. Spoken. Calm. Intentional.

A kind of proof that grief didn’t need to echo in order to matter.

One man spoke of a sister lost in a flood.

A woman whispered the name of the child she had given up and never seen again.

A teenager said only: “I miss her. I don’t know her name.”

Each time, the room accepted the voice. The mirrors clouded, then cleared. The air warmed slightly, just enough to remind them they were still among the living.

And each time, June wrote the names—real or not—into a thick cloth-bound ledger she kept in a wooden box.

Cole never looked inside.

That was her work.

His was elsewhere.

He’d been digging again.

Not out of compulsion, but out of necessity.

Somewhere beneath the southeast field, there was something waiting—not a relic, not a door, but a memory too old for language. Something left behind when the first people passed through this valley, before maps, before borders.

It wasn’t buried deep.

Just far enough to be forgotten.

He found it on the fourth morning of his digging.

A bowl. Carved from soapstone. Cracked but whole.

Inside, a stone token the size of a thumbnail, etched with a spiral and a line through its center.

He didn’t show June right away.

He washed it, dried it, and placed it on the mantel above the fireplace.

That night, she noticed.

“Is it from the Hollow?” she asked.

“No,” he said. “It’s older. But the Hollow remembers it.”

She picked it up carefully, rolled it between her fingers, then placed it back.

“It’s the same shape I’ve been drawing in my sleep,” she said.

Cole looked at her.

“You’ve been drawing again?”

June hesitated. Then nodded.

“I don’t remember doing it. But I wake up, and they’re there. On napkins. On the backs of receipts. On the walls, once.”

“Do you think it’s still speaking through you?”

She shook her head. “Not through. With. Like a second hand.”

Cole took a breath and let it sit between them.

That week, June stopped sleeping entirely.

Not from restlessness. She said she simply didn’t need it.

She moved through the days like someone in perfect balance with the time around her. She remembered everything: the scent of cedar when they first arrived, the weight of Clara’s name before she’d understood it, the precise hour her mother died. She didn’t mourn these things—not anymore. She used them.

She said memory, unweaponized, became resource.

Fuel.

Not fire.

Visitors kept coming, though fewer now.

Most stayed only minutes. They walked the perimeter of the doorframe in silence, then returned to their cars, faces changed.

One man cried.

Another smiled.

A child left a drawing pinned to the gate: two figures standing beneath a swirling sun, one with a line through her chest, the other holding the line like a leash or a thread.

Cole framed it.

They hung it beside the fireplace.

On the first day of June, a thunderstorm rolled in from the west, low and steady.

But the lightning never struck.

It stayed inside the clouds, roiling like thought.

Cole stood beneath the porch overhang, watching, and June came to stand beside him, bare feet on the boards, eyes soft.

“Do you think it’s done?” she asked.

“The Hollow?”

She nodded.

“No,” he said. “But I think we’re no longer what it’s waiting for.”

June nodded.

They didn’t need to speak further.

That night, they sat in the Anchor Room together, just the two of them.

No visitors.

No mirrors.

Just candlelight and the sound of rain against the roof.

They spoke aloud every name they could remember.

Friends.

Enemies.

Family.

Even those they had never met—names they’d only read or heard or dreamed.

Each name was a stone laid into a path they could not yet see.

When they finished, they sat in silence.

And in that stillness, a warmth filled the room—not from fire, but from recognition.

They had built something.

Not protection.

Not a sanctuary.

A threshold.

And thresholds, they knew now, were sacred.

Not because they separated.

But because they connected.

Because they held the moment between.

And if the Hollow had ever wanted to be more than hunger, more than echo—

It was now.

And June, resting her head on Cole’s shoulder, whispered the last word of the night.

“Stay.”

And the Hollow did.

Not as a threat.

Not even as a guest.

But as part of the house.

Watching.

And, finally, remembering back.

The sky cleared slowly over the next few days. Stormclouds retreated like a tide—hesitant, reluctant. Cole thought of them as animals, intelligent in a way humans rarely noticed. Not clever, but aware. And the Hollow, if it could be likened to anything in the natural world, had become like them: no longer hunting, no longer circling—just watching the weather change around it.

June took to walking at dawn now. Not far. Just the same path each time—starting at the old cottonwood, looping down past the water trough, cutting through the southern field, and pausing at the doorframe. She never walked through it anymore. That had been a ritual of transition, and they both knew it was done. She only touched the wood lightly each morning, as if checking to see if it still hummed.

It always did.

A quiet resonance.

Like breath in a cathedral.

On the third morning of her new routine, she returned with something new in her hand: a tin box no larger than a jewelry case, rusted at the edges and crusted with dry red soil. She found it beside the doorframe, buried just beneath a flat stone.

Inside were three items:

    A yellowed photograph of a man with one arm, seated beside a girl with an unreadable face.

    A smooth, black river stone with a spiral scratched into its surface.

    A hand-scrawled note, brittle and soft.

June read it aloud to Cole on the porch.

    I remember now. The way the earth tasted that day. How I didn’t scream. You said it would stop if I held still. I held still until I forgot what sound was.

    But I know your name now. And I forgive you.

Neither of them said anything for a while.

June folded the note again, gently, and placed it in the archive.

Cole kept the river stone.

He didn’t explain why, and June didn’t ask.

The next night, the wind returned—not loud, but fast. It came in short bursts, moving through the trees like something hunting for shape. The animals didn’t stir. The house didn’t creak. The Anchor Room remained still.

Cole stood at the window, watching the curtains shift.

“Do you feel it?” June asked.

He nodded. “Something’s moving inside it again. Not toward us. Just… within.”

“It’s testing itself,” she said. “Like stretching a leg that’s healed wrong.”

He turned from the window.

“Do you think it knows what we’ve done?”

June shook her head.

“I think it’s beginning to want to know.”

That, they agreed, was a better start than they’d ever expected.

June resumed drawing.

Not every night. Not even regularly.

Only when her hands itched with something that had no name.

The sketches weren’t spirals anymore. Nor fractures. Nor lines.

They were fields.

Topographies.

Some bore resemblance to their own land—the curve of the east ridge, the cluster of elms to the north—but others showed impossible places. Deserts with glasslike floors. Hills of bone. Forests lit with lanterns that floated with no strings. Sometimes Cole saw faces in the lines. Other times, he saw words.

He began to label them.

Not like a cartographer.

Like a translator.

“Map of What Might Have Been.”

“Region of What Was Lost, But Left Seeds.”

“Shoreline of Forgiveness, Low Tide.”

They kept them all in the archive.

And by then, the archive had become more than a room.

It was a recording—a consciousness stitched together by intention.

And the Hollow, once just a consumer of memory, had started to co-author.

The air in the archive was thicker now. Not oppressive. Just full.

Like a room that held its breath, hoping not to forget what it had just learned.

One afternoon, a child arrived.

No parents.

No car in sight.

No name.

Just walked through the front gate and stood in the yard, staring at the doorframe, then at the porch.

Cole stepped outside and squatted to meet his eye.

“You looking for something, bud?”

The boy blinked. Then shook his head.

“I remembered something I wasn’t supposed to. I think it came from here.”

June came out next, her hands wrapped in a dish towel. She watched quietly.

“What did you remember?” she asked.

The boy looked at the doorframe.

“I was under water. Not real water. Heavy water. It made everything quiet, but I could still hear someone counting. Not loud. Just in my chest.”

“Did it scare you?” Cole asked.

The boy shrugged. “I think I was the one doing the counting.”

June stepped forward and gently took his hand.

“We don’t forget people like you,” she said. “Would you like to sit for a while?”

He nodded.

They made him tea.

He drank it quietly and left before sundown.

No one came looking for him.

No one ever did.

That night, the Hollow stirred again.

Not with sound.

With light.

The mirrors in the Anchor Room—long since cleared of fog—caught something not present in the room. Faint pulses of color, like the afterimage of lightning behind the eyes. Each mirror showed a different moment.

In one: Clara, looking over her shoulder, half-smiling.

In another: a flood receding backward, un-filling the land.

In a third: a spiral made of people standing hand-in-hand, facing inward.

June and Cole watched, not speaking.

The reflections didn’t beg for interpretation.

They simply offered.

Like memories from someone who had never before been understood.

And who, for the first time, trusted them enough to try.

By month’s end, the Hollow had changed.

Its shape had softened.

Its needs had shifted.

It still watched. Still held echoes.

But now, it offered space.

And when June returned to the doorframe one morning and found a second frame built beside it—same size, different wood, darker grain, smoothed edges—she didn’t call for Cole.

She stood between them.

Then stepped through both.

Nothing happened.

But everything was different.

Because now there were options.

Now the threshold didn’t lead only in or out.

It led across.

To parallel griefs.

To shared memory.

To the possibility that something broken could still be.

Still become.

Still belong.

She smiled.

And in the field behind her, the wind moved like breath through a sleeping giant’s lungs.

Still.

Alive.

And listening.
