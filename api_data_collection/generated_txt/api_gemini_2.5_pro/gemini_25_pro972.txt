The air in the workshop was thick, a meal of cedar dust and tung oil that coated the back of Clara Thorne’s throat. It was a taste she’d known since she was a girl, trailing her father through a blizzard of sawdust, and it was more comforting than any home-cooked meal. Sunlight, pale as watered-down milk, streamed through the high, grimy windows of the converted stable, illuminating the motes of wood that danced in a silent, perpetual waltz. Her world was one of right angles and flush joints, of the patient rasp of a hand plane shaving a ribbon of pine an atom-thick, of the definitive thud of a mortise and tenon slotting together. Her hands, broad and capable, were mapped with the faint white lines of old splinters and the hardened pads of calluses that could press against a spinning sander without flinching.

She was working on a set of library stairs, a finicky, Escher-like construction of oak for a barrister with more books than sense. The design was his—pretentious, overly ornate—but the execution was hers, and that’s where the soul of the thing lived. The curve of the banister had to flow, not just look like a curve. It had to invite the hand. Clara ran her palm along the wood, feeling for the infinitesimal bumps her eyes couldn't see, her head tilted, listening. Wood wasn't silent. It hummed with a kind of memory, and her job was to be its interpreter. This was a language she understood. It was solid. It was real. You could lean on it.

The job that changed things wasn't grand. It was a clear-out. An old terraced house near St Thomas, the kind with a lingering smell of damp and fried bacon trapped in the wallpaper. The owner had passed on, no family to speak of, and the estate agent wanted the period features salvaged before the guts were ripped out. Floorboards, mostly. Good Victorian pine, tight-grained and rich with amber resin. Clara was on her knees in the attic, a head torch cutting a dusty tunnel through the gloom, prying up the first board when she saw it. Tucked under a shroud of yellowed bedsheets and a cloud of desiccated cobwebs was a long, black case. It wasn't a coffin, but it had that same solemn stillness.

Curiosity was an inefficient emotion, one she usually sanded down and smoothed away. But the shape was undeniable. She nudged it with the toe of her boot. It was solid. Grunting with the effort of balancing on the joists, she dragged it out into the weak light filtering through the single filthy dormer window. The clasps were rusted, blooming with orange corrosion, but they sprang open with a groan. The inside was lined with worn-out burgundy velvet, the fabric compressed and shiny in places. And lying in that plush, faded bed was a guitar.

It wasn't a fancy instrument. An acoustic, a deep, warm brown with scratches and dings that mapped a life of careless love. One of the tuning pegs was a mismatched ivory colour. A string was missing, a lonely gap in the silver sextet. A faint, sweet smell of dust and old wood rose from it, a different dialect from the one spoken in her workshop. She didn’t play. The idea was absurd. Music was for other people. People with time on their hands, people without a stack of invoices to chase and a VAT return to file. Music was… nebulous. You couldn’t build a house with it.

Still. She ran a finger over the sound hole, tracing the inlaid mother-of-pearl rosette. It was a piece of craftsmanship, just a different kind. The estate agent had told her to chuck any rubbish. This felt like more than rubbish. On a whim, an illogical, inefficient whim, she closed the lid. She’d told herself she’d try and sell it, maybe get twenty quid for it down the Cavern. It was just another piece of salvage. But as she hauled it down the narrow attic ladder, bumping it against the wall, she was careful not to scratch it any further.

The guitar case leaned against the wall of her workshop for three days, an awkward, silent visitor in a room full of noise and purpose. Her tools seemed to regard it with suspicion. Her father, popping in to drop off a sharpening stone, certainly did. Arthur Thorne was a man carved from the same timber he worked, weathered and unyielding. His eyes, the same pale grey as Clara’s, flicked to the case.

“What’s that, then?”

“Found it on a job. Might sell it.” Clara didn’t look up from the dovetail she was marking. Showing interest was a sign of weakness.

“Hmph. More junk.” He placed the stone on her workbench. “Music.” He said the word like it was a diagnosis. “A distraction. You’ve got good hands, Clara. Don’t go filling your head with nonsense.”

It wasn’t cruel. It was his way. To Arthur, the world was divided into the useful and the useless. A well-made chair was useful. A song was not. He’d seen his own brother, Clara’s uncle, try to make a living as a musician, a life of smoky pubs and unpaid bills that ended in a poky flat in Plymouth, smelling of regret. For Arthur, it was a cautionary tale. For Clara, it had been a reason to double down on her apprenticeship, to prove she was the sensible one, the one who could be relied upon.

His words should have been the end of it. She should have taken the case straight to the pawn shop. But that night, after the saws fell silent and the workshop was dark, she unlocked the door to her small flat above. The familiar scent of turpentine and coffee hung in the air. And instead of switching on the telly or opening a book, she brought the guitar upstairs.

It felt enormous in her small living room. She sat on the edge of her sofa, the instrument laid across her lap, its polished wood reflecting the dim glow of a streetlamp outside. It was clumsy. Awkward. She didn't know how to hold it. The calluses on her left hand, so useful for shrugging off splinters, were thick and dead against the thin metal of the frets. She pressed a finger down. It felt like trying to thread a needle wearing gardening gloves. She tried to strum with her right thumb, raking it across the five remaining strings.

The sound that came out was a discordant, buzzing catastrophe. A throttled clang of notes fighting each other, none of them clear, none of them right. It was an ugly, broken noise. She flinched. Frustration, hot and sharp, pricked at her. In her workshop, if a sound was wrong, she knew why. The blade was dull, the wood was warped, the angle was off. She could diagnose it, fix it. This was just… chaos. She tried again, pressing her fingers down harder, trying to force the notes into submission. The result was the same metallic jangle, a sound that set her teeth on edge.

This was stupid. Her dad was right. Nonsense. She was a carpenter. A creator of solid, tangible things. This collection of wire and wood was deliberately obtuse, a puzzle with no logical solution. She put it down, the silence of the room rushing back in, thick and judgmental. The guitar sat on the rug, looking up at her, its single dark eye of a sound hole daring her to try again. And to her own profound annoyance, she knew she would.The following day, the familiar rhythm of the workshop felt off-key. The whine of the table saw was just noise, not a clean cut in the making. The scent of cedar seemed thinner, less satisfying. Her mind kept snagging on the memory of that ugly, dissonant sound. It was like a poorly fitted joint, a gap that her thoughts kept trying to fill. Twice, she had to re-measure a cut for the barrister’s ludicrous staircase, a mistake born of inattention that made her cheeks burn with a private shame. Her father’s voice echoed in her head, a gravelly ghost warning her about distractions. For the first time, she wondered if he might be right.

That night, she approached the guitar not with a whim, but with a plan. This was a problem of engineering, of tension and frequency. She brought it to her workbench in the flat, a scarred old table she’d built herself, and propped it up against a stack of woodworking magazines. On her laptop, she typed ‘How to tune a guitar’ into the search bar. The screen filled with a hundred smiling faces, all promising to make it easy. She chose a video with a no-nonsense title and a presenter who looked more like a technician than a rock star. He spoke of standard tuning, of E-A-D-G-B-E, a meaningless incantation she dutifully wrote down on a scrap of paper. She downloaded a tuner app on her phone, its digital needle twitching on the screen.

The process was an exercise in excruciating patience. She’d pluck the thickest string, and the app would glow an angry red. ‘Too low’. She’d turn the tuning peg, a fraction of a millimetre, and the note would screech past its target. ‘Too high’. The old metal groaned in protest. Her callused fingers struggled to get a delicate grip on the pegs, her touch too used to brute force and firm leverage. The mismatched ivory-coloured peg was stiff, resisting her attempts to turn it with a stubbornness she recognised from a piece of warped oak. But Clara was nothing if not persistent. Slowly, painstakingly, she wrestled each string into submission, watching the needle on her phone flicker from red to a satisfying, clean green. One by one, the notes fell into line: E, A, D, G… She couldn’t find a new B string in the house, so the second-to-last peg remained empty, a silent gap in the chorus. Finally, the high E. The guitar was tuned.

She looked at it, now a calibrated tool rather than a piece of junk. The next video showed a simple two-finger chord. E minor. The instructor’s hand moved with an easy grace, his fingers landing on the strings like birds on a wire. Clara tried to mimic the shape. Her own hand felt like a block of wood. Her index and middle fingers, used to wrapping around the handle of a mallet, were clumsy and thick. They landed with a dead thud, muting the adjacent strings. She repositioned them, her wrist aching at the unfamiliar angle. She took a breath, the way she did before making a final, critical cut.

She strummed. Not with a wild rake of her thumb, but with a deliberate downward stroke of her index finger. It wasn’t a clang. It wasn’t a catastrophe. It was a sound. A deep, melancholic chord that hung in the quiet air of her flat for a breathtaking moment. It wasn't perfect; a faint buzz still lurked beneath the surface, but it was a harmony. It was a single, coherent thought, spoken in a language she was just beginning to decipher. The vibration travelled from the strings, through the body of the guitar, and into her own. It was a resonance she felt in her ribs, a physical presence as real as the workbench beneath her elbows. It wasn't a chair or a staircase, but it was built. It held its own shape in the air. For a second, Clara Thorne didn't think about invoices, or angles, or the biting critique of her father. She just listened. And then, she played it again.The single chord became a mantra. E minor. She played it over and over, the sound blooming in the small room, then fading into the hum of the refrigerator. Each time, she tried to replicate it perfectly, adjusting the pressure of her fingers, the angle of her wrist, the motion of her strum. It was a problem of precision, a different kind from the tolerances she worked with in the shop, but a problem she could understand. It was about finding the exact point where pressure and position produced a clean result. The resonance was a physical fact, a vibration she could feel against her stomach. It wasn't nebulous at all. It was physics. It was geometry. It was something she could, with enough effort, master.

A new routine was planed and sanded into shape. By day, she was Clara the carpenter, her hours marked by the scream of the router and the satisfying scrape of a cabinet scraper. But when the dust settled and she locked the workshop door behind her, she climbed the stairs to her second, secret apprenticeship. The television stayed dark. Her books on furniture design lay unopened. The guitar came out of its case, a conspirator in the quiet of the evening. She’d sit for hours, her back aching, a collection of online tutorials open on her laptop, her brow furrowed in concentration. The world shrank to the six inches of the fretboard, a landscape of polished wood and metal ridges.

Progress was a brutal, humbling slog. After mastering the E minor, she attempted a G major. The diagram on the screen looked simple enough, but contorting her hand into the required shape felt like a form of torture. Her ring finger, accustomed to the heft of a chisel, refused to arch properly, muting the string below it. Her pinky, rarely used for precision work, had a mind of its own, trembling and weak. A sharp, stinging pain began to bloom in the tips of her fingers, a protest from calluses being asked to perform a new and delicate task. For every one clean chord, she produced a dozen choked, buzzing failures. The frustration was immense, a familiar red heat that in the workshop would be solved by sharpening a tool or re-clamping a piece of wood. Here, there was no tool to fix but her own stubborn anatomy.

Then, one night, after what felt like a hundred failed attempts, it happened. Her fingers, clumsy and protesting, found their places for the G chord. She strummed. It rang out, clear and bright. Emboldened, she moved back to the familiar shape of the E minor. The transition was slow, a graceless shuffle of fingers, but the chord was there. G. Strum. E minor. Strum. Back and forth. G. E minor. G. E minor. It was the simplest of progressions, a two-chord seesaw, but it was more than just a sound; it was a movement. A story in two words. A structure she had built, note by note. In the silence of her flat, lit only by the screen of her laptop, Clara Thorne held a piece of resonant, vibrating air in her hands, and for the first time understood that you could, in fact, build something with a song.The two-chord song became her secret obsession. She bought a pack of strings online, a small, anonymous brown envelope that felt illicit when it arrived. Replacing the missing B string was a delicate operation, far more fiddly than setting the blade on a spokeshave. She followed a diagram, carefully threading the new silver wire through the bridge and up to the headstock, winding it onto its peg. With the sextet complete, the guitar felt whole. The chords sounded richer, fuller. The simple G to E minor progression now had a brighter voice chiming in the middle. Her fingertips, once impervious, were now perpetually tender. The hardened pads of her wood-working calluses began to soften and peel, revealing new, sharper pains underneath as they toughened in a different way. Her hands were being remapped, the old territories of splinters and scrapes giving way to a new geography of raw, sensitive nerve-endings.

Her work began to feel different, too. While sanding the sweeping curve of the barrister’s banister, she found her mind wandering not to the next joint or the final finish, but to the shape of the music she was learning. The rise and fall of a melody felt like the arc of the handrail beneath her palm. The satisfying fit of a dovetail joint echoed the clean resolution of a chord change. The workshop, once her entire universe, now felt like one half of a life. She performed her tasks with the same ingrained competence, her muscle memory ensuring the quality of her work never slipped, but her mind was elsewhere, humming scales, rehearsing the clumsy transition from a C to a G chord. It was a dual existence, the carpenter and the novice, and she guarded the line between them fiercely. The guitar case remained downstairs during the day, a silent, black sentinel that Arthur, on his now-infrequent visits, thankfully ignored.

One Saturday afternoon, she drove to a music shop in the city centre, a place she had walked past a thousand times without ever registering its existence. The bell above the door chimed, announcing her to a room that smelled of lemon oil and old carpet. It was an alien environment, a forest of polished wood and gleaming metal entirely different from her own. Guitars of every conceivable shape and colour hung from the walls like exotic fruit. A young man with ink-stained arms and a kind smile asked if she needed help. Clara, feeling like an impostor, mumbled something about needing a tuner. She felt him clock her hands, the hands of a manual labourer, and braced for a flicker of condescension. Instead, he just nodded. "The clip-on ones are easiest," he said, pulling a small black device from a glass case. "Clips to the headstock. More accurate than a phone app." The transaction was quick, impersonal, but as she walked out with the tuner and a thin plastic pick in a small paper bag, she felt a definitive shift. This wasn't just a found object anymore. This was hers.

The clip-on tuner was a revelation. Its backlit screen responded instantly, a precise and unforgiving judge. It made the process faster, more efficient, and she attacked her practice with renewed vigour. She learned a C chord, then a D. She discovered the horror of the F barre chord, a seemingly impossible feat of strength and dexterity that left her hand cramping and a string of curses hanging in the air of her flat. It was a physical wall, and for days she slammed against it, producing nothing but dead, muted thuds. It was infuriating. It was a bad joint, a stripped screw, a piece of wood that fought back. She treated it as such. She broke it down, analysed the pressure points, the angle of her wrist, the placement of her thumb on the neck. She worked at it with the same dogged persistence she’d use to flatten a warped tabletop, and then, one evening, it clicked. Her finger pressed down, flat and hard, and all six strings rang out. It wasn't beautiful, but it was an F chord. It was a victory.

With a handful of chords at her command, she found a tutorial for a simple folk song. It was a mournful, three-chord ballad about a lost love and a long journey home. The melody was plain, the lyrics simple. The first time she tried to play and sing, it was a disaster. Her fingers forgot their shapes, her strumming rhythm fell apart, and her voice, rusty from disuse, was a tuneless croak. It was the discordant clang from that first night all over again, and she felt a hot blush of failure. But the ghost of the melody was there. She could hear it, even if she couldn't yet produce it. So she broke it down, measure by measure. She played the chord progression until it was second nature, a fluid movement that her fingers could perform without conscious thought. Then she added her voice, quietly at first, humming along. And finally, sitting on the edge of her sofa in the semi-darkness, she put it all together. The chords rang out, her strum was steady, and her voice, though hesitant and unpolished, found the notes. She played the song all the way through without stopping. The final chord faded, and the silence that followed was different. It wasn’t empty. It was filled with the echo of what she had made. A complete, solid thing. A story. A song.### Chapter 2

The song followed her into the workshop the next morning. It was a persistent ghost, a hum in the back of her mind that harmonised with the drone of the dust extractor. When she returned to the barrister’s staircase, it no longer looked merely pretentious. It looked stiff, a series of notes played without feeling. The design called for a curve, but her breakthrough the night before had taught her the difference between a shape and a feeling. A curve on a blueprint was a dead thing. The rise and fall of a melody, however, was alive. It had tension and release. It invited you to follow it. She looked at the half-finished banister, her tools laid out beside it, and saw not a set of instructions to be followed, but a composition waiting for an interpretation.

Her approach to the wood changed. Before, her work had been a dialogue between her hands and the material, a negotiation based on grain and density. Now, a third voice had joined the conversation: music. As she picked up a compass plane, its curved sole designed for shaping concave arcs, she wasn't just thinking about the radius specified in the drawings. She was thinking of the melancholy three-chord progression of the folk ballad. She ran the plane along the oak, the blade taking a whisper-thin shaving. Her movements became less rigid, more fluid. She let the tool follow a line that felt right, a line that seemed to sing. She was shaping the banister not just for the hand, but for the ear, crafting a visual melody that would guide a person up the stairs. It was a slow, intuitive process, governed by a logic her father would have dismissed as pure fantasy.

The heavy workshop door scraped open, letting in a draft of cool morning air and the familiar, solid presence of her father. He didn't announce himself, he never did. He simply materialised, his critical gaze sweeping the room, taking inventory. Clara didn't tense up, not exactly, but she felt the shift in the atmosphere. The private, humming world she had built around herself and the staircase suddenly felt fragile, exposed. Arthur walked over, his boots silent on the sawdust-cushioned floor. He didn't look at her; his eyes were fixed on the banister. He ran his own callused hand, a mirror of her own but older and harder, along the sweep of wood she had just been shaping.

“You’ve changed the line,” he stated. It wasn’t a question. His finger traced the arc, which now dipped slightly more than the plans dictated before rising again towards the newel post. “The plans showed a constant radius. This is… something else.” He looked from the wood to her, his pale grey eyes narrowed with a familiar, weary suspicion. “Getting fanciful, Clara. It’s a staircase, not a sculpture.” He gestured vaguely towards the corner where the guitar case had stood. “All that nonsense. Told you it puts ideas in your head. Useless ideas.”

The accusation, the link he made so easily between a perceived flaw in her work and the secret she was nurturing, should have made her flinch. A week ago, it would have. She would have mumbled an apology, scraped the curve back to match the drawing, and felt the hot sting of his disapproval as a failure on her part. But the memory of the song, the feeling of the chord resonating against her ribs, had built something new inside her. It was a small, quiet structure, but it was solid. She didn't look away. She left her hand on the banister, claiming the altered line as her own. “The design felt stiff,” she said, her voice even. “It fought the eye. A staircase should invite you up. This flows better.” She used his language, the language of function and form, but the meaning beneath it was entirely hers. It was the first time she hadn’t just accepted his verdict. It was a quiet act of rebellion, as small and significant as learning a new chord. Arthur stared at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable, a man confronting a knot in a piece of wood he thought he knew perfectly. He just grunted, a sound of profound disapproval, and turned away to inspect the blade on her table saw. The conversation was over, but the space between them now held a new, resonant tension.The echo of Arthur's grunt lingered long after he was gone, a heavier presence than the cedar dust. Clara stood for a long time, her hand still resting on the banister, the smooth, controversial curve cool beneath her palm. It felt like a line she had drawn in the sawdust. For her entire life, his approval had been the true north of her compass, the standard against which every joint was measured. To deliberately defy it, even in this small way, felt like stepping off a map. A tremor of fear ran through her, the old, ingrained habit of wanting to please him, to be the sensible, reliable one. But beneath it was something else, something stubborn and resonant like the G chord she'd finally nailed. The banister flowed. She was right. The certainty of it was a new kind of solid, a foundation she was laying for herself. She picked up her plane again, the fear receding with each pass, replaced by the quiet, focused hum of purpose.

She finished the library stairs the following week. Each piece was sanded to a glassy smoothness, each joint a testament to her skill, but the soul of the thing remained in that one rebellious curve. Loading it into the van for delivery felt momentous. The barrister, a portly man named Mr. Alistair Finch, met her at his grand house near Sefton Park. He circled the assembled staircase in his book-lined study, his spectacles perched on the end of his nose, puffing slightly. Clara held her breath, her hands shoved deep in her pockets, feeling more exposed than if she were standing there naked. He ran his hand along the banister, his fingers tracing the exact same path her father’s had. He paused at the dip. Clara prepared her defense, a speech about flow and ergonomics she had rehearsed in her head. But Finch didn’t frown. He turned, a slow smile spreading across his face.

"My dear woman," he boomed, his voice echoing in the high-ceilinged room. "It's perfect. Better than the drawings." He gestured vaguely at a roll of architectural plans on his desk. "Those were just lines, you see. Rigid. This… this has poetry to it. It *sings*." The word hung in the air between them. Clara felt a jolt, a shock of recognition so profound it almost buckled her knees. He understood. He had heard the music in the wood. A warmth spread through her chest, a feeling of validation so potent it was dizzying. As she wrote out the final invoice, her hand steady, she realised it wasn't just about being right. It was about being heard. The cheque he wrote her, for a sum that made her eyes widen, felt secondary to the simple, profound fact of his understanding.

The success with the staircase emboldened her. She returned to the music shop that weekend, the bell chiming a welcome this time instead of a warning. She bought a beginner's songbook, a slim volume filled with folk standards and traditional tunes. The pages were a new kind of blueprint, a set of instructions for building something invisible. Back in her flat, the world of her workshop seemed to bleed into her practice. The steady, percussive rhythm she tapped out with her foot was the beat of a mallet striking a chisel. The shape of her hand forming a complex chord was the same patient contortion required to hold a piece steady for a difficult cut. The two disciplines were not at war; they were speaking different dialects of the same language, a language of tension, structure, and release. Her fingers, once so clumsy, were becoming more nimble, the new calluses forming hard little shields on their tips.

The ad was tacked to the corkboard at the local café where she sometimes grabbed a coffee: ‘Acoustic Open Mic Night. Every Tuesday. All Welcome.’ The thought of it was terrifying, a public performance of the secret she had guarded so closely. But the idea wasn't to play. The idea was just to go. To be in a room where music wasn't a distraction or a form of nonsense, but the main event. She went the following Tuesday, nursing a pint of bitter at a small table in the back of a dimly lit pub called The Grapes. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer and anticipation. A succession of performers took to the small, makeshift stage: a nervous young woman with a powerful voice, a bearded man who played intricate fingerstyle blues, a trio of students who harmonised beautifully. Clara watched, mesmerised. She wasn't just listening to the songs; she was watching their hands. She saw the same chord shapes she practiced, the same awkward shift to an F barre, the same focused concentration. These were her people. They spoke her new language. And she realised with a jolt that the fear she felt was tangled up with a thread of pure, unadulterated longing. She wanted to be up there. The thought was so audacious, so completely at odds with the sensible carpenter she had always been, that she nearly laughed out loud.

When she got home that night, the flat felt too quiet. The silence no longer seemed judgmental, but expectant. She took the guitar from its case. The wood felt familiar and warm against her, an extension of her own body. She didn't open the songbook. Instead, she just let her fingers find the G chord, then the C, then the D. A simple progression she had learned. But this time, as she played, she wasn't just copying. She was listening for the spaces in between the notes. A small, hesitant melody began to emerge, a questioning phrase of just three or four notes that she played over and over, weaving it around the chords. It wasn't a song. It was barely a fragment. But it was hers. It was a splinter of her own voice, pulled from the quiet, and she had a sudden, unshakeable conviction that she could build it into something real. Something you could lean on. The workshop was no longer her only world; it was just the foundation for a much taller structure she was only just beginning to build.The commission that followed the barrister’s staircase was a departure. It came not from an architect with rigid plans, but from an antique dealer with a reverence for the past. The object was a sea captain’s chest from the late 1800s, battered and scarred from a life of travel. One corner was blown out, the dovetails gaping where it had been dropped, and the original French polish finish was a crazed and cloudy ruin. Beneath the grime, however, the mahogany was a deep, plum-red, and the brass fittings, though green with verdigris, were heavy and beautifully cast. The dealer wanted it brought back to life, but not stripped of its soul. "Don't make it look new," he'd said, his fingers tracing a dark ring stain on the lid. "Make it look loved." The instruction resonated with Clara, lodging in her mind next to Mr. Finch’s praise. It was a new kind of brief, one that required empathy as much as skill.

Her nights were now split between wrestling with the tyrannical F barre chord and chasing the ghost of her own melody. The four-note phrase she had stumbled upon was maddeningly elusive. She would play it, and it would sound right, full of a quiet, questioning feeling. But when she tried to add to it, to build the next part of the structure, it collapsed into aimless noodling. It lacked a logical progression. In the workshop, if a piece didn't fit, she could measure, mark, and cut until it did. Here, there were no rulers or squares. She filled a page in a notebook with aborted attempts at lyrics, clumsy rhymes and clichéd phrases about broken hearts and endless roads that she immediately scored out in disgust. They were someone else's words, hollow and false. She was a carpenter, not a poet. Her language was in the grain of wood, not the ink of a pen.

She brought the captain's chest into her workshop and began the slow, meditative process of disassembly. As she carefully knocked the joints apart with a rubber mallet, a faint, unfamiliar scent was released from the old wood: salt, beeswax, and something else, something sharp and foreign like long-vanished pipe tobacco. She imagined the hands that had packed this chest, the voyages it had taken, the rooms it had sat in across a century. She was no longer just a woodworker; she was an archaeologist, uncovering a history written in dings and watermarks. When she worked on the damaged corner, she didn't just glue and clamp it. She studied the break, the way the fibres had torn, and reinforced it from the inside with a small, perfectly fitted block of mahogany, a hidden patch that would hold it together for another hundred years. She was honouring its story, not erasing it.

Her father found her polishing the brass handles, the metal gleaming a warm gold against the newly revived mahogany. He picked up one of the handles she had yet to clean, turning the heavy, verdigris-coated brass over in his palm. "Good casting," he conceded. He ran his thumb over the corner she had repaired. "Tidy work. Almost invisible." It was high praise, the closest he ever came to an outright compliment. But then his eyes narrowed on the chest's surface, where Clara had spent days painstakingly building up layers of shellac, a finish that was clear and deep but deliberately left some of the fainter scratches and old stains visible beneath its sheen. "You've left the damage." It was a statement of fact, layered with confusion. "Why wouldn't you sand it back to clean wood?"

"The dealer wanted to keep its character," Clara said, her voice steady as she buffed a corner of the brass. "The marks are part of its history." Arthur grunted, the familiar sound of dismissal that set her teeth on edge. "History doesn't make it useful. A flaw is a flaw. People pay for perfect." He looked at her then, a long, searching look. "You're getting sentimental, girl. It's the wood and the joints that matter. The rest is just stories. Nonsense." He said the word 'stories' with the same disdain he reserved for 'music.' He didn't see the guitar case, which was safely upstairs, but he didn't need to. In his mind, the connection was already made. The flawed chest and the unheard music were symptoms of the same burgeoning affliction.

His words followed her upstairs that night, sharp and insistent as the sting of turpentine. *A flaw is a flaw. The rest is just stories.* She sat with the guitar across her lap, her notebook open on the floor beside her. The blank page seemed to mock her. Frustrated, she put down her pen and just played her four-note melody, over and over. Then, thinking of the chest, of the marks she had chosen to preserve, she found the chords to go under them. G. C. E minor. A simple, sturdy progression. She closed her eyes and let her mind drift back to the workshop. The smell of cedar dust. The pale winter sunlight. The patient rasp of a hand plane. The definitive thud of a mortise and tenon. Solid. Real. She picked up the pen, and this time she didn't try to be a poet. She just wrote what she knew. *'Hands mapped with faint white lines / a language of the grain and time.'* The words weren't perfect, but they were true. They were hers. Another line came, about the sound of a saw and the taste of the air. It was a list, a series of simple observations. It was a blueprint. And as she sang the simple words to her simple melody, the song began to stand up on its own two feet.

By the end of the week, she had it. Two verses and a chorus. The structure was as plain as a Shaker chair, the lyrics a quiet catalogue of her world. It spoke of the comfort of right angles, the memory locked in the wood, and the quiet rebellion of a single, flowing curve. It wasn't a lament for a lost love or a ballad about a long journey. It was about a carpenter in a workshop, standing her ground. It was her story. She played it through, her fingers finding the chords without hesitation, her voice, though unpolished, gaining a quiet confidence. The final chord hung in the air of the small living room, a perfectly fitted joint. For a long moment, she just sat there, listening to the silence it left behind. It was a solid thing she had built, as real as the sea captain's chest downstairs. She looked at the guitar, its wood gleaming in the lamplight, and then her eyes drifted to the coat hanging by the door. In its pocket was the flyer for The Grapes, a crumpled, folded-up question she now felt she might just have the courage to answer.### Chapter 3

For two days, the flyer for The Grapes sat on her workbench, acquiring a fine coat of sawdust. It was a flimsy piece of paper holding a heavyweight question. Every time her gaze drifted to it, a cold knot of fear tightened in her stomach. The idea was absurd. Her, on a stage? Her song was a private thing, a piece of joinery made for a room of one. It was unfinished, rough-sawn, full of flaws she alone could see. To expose it to strangers felt like taking a half-built cabinet and asking for a critique. It went against every instinct she had. And yet, the memory of the barrister's words—*it sings*—and the quiet pride she felt in her own small melody formed a stubborn counter-argument. It was one thing to build something solid; it was another to see if it could stand on its own out in the world. On Tuesday evening, after sweeping the workshop floor, she picked up the flyer, folded it into a tight square, and put it in her pocket. She didn't make a grand decision; she simply went upstairs, put the guitar in its case, and walked out the door.

The walk to the pub was a short, ten-minute ordeal that felt like a cross-country trek. The guitar case, which had once felt like an awkward appendage, was now a public proclamation. It bumped against her leg with every step, a constant, black reminder of her folly. She felt impossibly conspicuous, certain that every passerby, every face in a passing car, was staring at the case and judging her as a fraud. Her toolbag, heavy and reassuring, declared her purpose and competence to the world. This case just declared an ambition she had no right to. Her hands, tucked in her pockets, were clammy and cold. She was a carpenter walking into a den of poets, and she had never felt more out of place in her own skin.

Pushing open the door to The Grapes was like breaking the surface of water. The warm, thick air, dense with the smell of beer and bodies, enveloped her. The low chatter of the crowd and the sound of a guitar being tuned on stage was a familiar soundscape, but tonight it felt predatory. A man with a friendly, tired face stood by the stage with a clipboard. The list. The point of no return. Clara approached him, her heart thumping a frantic, off-beat rhythm against her ribs. “I’d… like to play,” she managed to say, the words feeling foreign in her mouth. He smiled and held out a pen. “Sure thing. What’s the name?” She looked at the list of names already there—‘Rowan’, ‘Midnight Blue’, ‘Jax’—names that sounded like they belonged on a stage. She hesitated for a second, then wrote ‘Clara Thorne’ in her neat, practical block letters. It looked stark and plain, a mortise joint in a list of filigree.

She found the same table in the back as before, placing the guitar case beside her like a nervous chaperone. The pint she ordered sat untouched, its condensation forming a ring on the dark wood of the table. One by one, the names on the list were called. A young man sang a rapid-fire, witty song that made the crowd laugh. A woman played a piano ballad so heart-wrenching it seemed to lower the temperature of the room. They were all so confident, their instruments extensions of their bodies, their voices tools they wielded with practiced ease. With each performance, her own song felt smaller, plainer, a thing of simple pine next to their polished mahogany and exotic veneers. The desire to grab her case and flee was a physical force, a tide pulling her towards the door. She gripped the edge of the table, her knuckles white, and forced herself to stay. She had come this far. She would see it through.

“And next up… Clara Thorne!” The MC’s voice cut through the haze of her anxiety. The smattering of polite applause sounded like a death knell. For a terrifying second, she couldn’t move. Her boots felt nailed to the floor. Then, some deeper instinct, the same one that made her finish a job no matter how difficult, took over. She stood up, her legs stiff, and retrieved the guitar case. The walk to the stage felt a hundred miles long. The single spotlight was a blast of heat and white blindness, erasing the faces in the crowd and leaving her utterly alone. She sat on the worn wooden stool, her hands shaking as she unlatched the case and lifted the guitar. It felt slick and unfamiliar in her trembling grip. The microphone stood before her like an inquisitor.

She took a breath, trying to steady herself. The air was dry, and her throat felt like it was coated in cement, not cedar dust. She looked down, away from the blinding light, and focused on the fretboard. It was a familiar landscape. A world of right angles and precise measurements she understood. Her fingers, clumsy with nerves, found their place for the opening G chord. She strummed. The sound that boomed from the speakers was shockingly loud, a magnified version of the quiet sound from her flat. It was riddled with the buzz of a finger not pressed down quite hard enough. She flinched, and a hot wave of shame washed over her. But then she took another breath, adjusted her grip, and played the chord again. This time it was clean. She closed her eyes and began to sing, her voice barely a whisper at first. *'Hands mapped with faint white lines…'*

As the words of her world filled the small, silent space around her, something shifted. She wasn't a fraud on a stage anymore; she was a carpenter in her workshop. She sang of the pale sunlight and the rasp of the plane, of the comfort of a solid joint. The song was her shield and her foundation. Her fingers moved through the chords—G, C, E minor—the progression as steady and reliable as the four walls of her workshop. The rhythm of her strumming found its groove, and her voice, though still unpolished, grew stronger, imbued with the simple, unadorned truth of her lyrics. She wasn't performing; she was testifying. For two and a half minutes, she built her world in the air of that pub, and then, with a final, fading E minor chord, it was done.

The silence that followed was absolute. It stretched for an eternity, a vast, empty space where she was sure judgment was about to crash down. Her eyes snapped open. She could just make out the shapes of people in the darkness beyond the light. Then, a single person began to clap. Another joined in, and then another. It wasn't a roar, not the wild applause some of the other acts had received. It was a warm, steady wave of appreciation. It was the sound of being heard. A man at a nearby table, the bearded one who’d played the intricate blues earlier, caught her eye and gave her a slow, deliberate nod of respect. Relief, pure and overwhelming, washed through her, so potent it made her feel lightheaded. She mumbled a thank you into the microphone, her voice thick, and all but fled the stage.

Back at her table, she finally took a long drink of her beer, the cool liquid a balm on her raw throat. The rest of the evening passed in a blur. She didn't leave immediately. She stayed and listened, but the music sounded different now. She was no longer on the outside looking in. She was part of the chorus. When the last performer finished, she packed her guitar, the instrument feeling warm and alive in her hands. Walking home, the cool night air felt clean and sharp. The streets were quiet, and the weight of the case on her shoulder was a comfortable, familiar burden. It was the satisfying weight of a tool that had done its job well. She hadn't left the carpenter behind on that stage. She had simply shown everyone the other thing she could build. And as she unlocked the door to her flat, she knew, with a certainty as solid as oak, that it was only the beginning.### Chapter 3

The following morning, the workshop was exactly as she had left it, a still life in sawdust and pale light. But Clara felt re-calibrated. As she switched on the lights and the familiar hum of the fluorescent tubes filled the space, she noticed the world with a musician's ear. The drone of the dust extractor wasn't just a drone; it was a low, sustained E-flat. The rhythmic squeak of the old belt sander had a distinct tempo. She was humming the melody of her song, the simple four-note phrase now a part of her own internal soundscape, as she laid out her chisels. The memory of the applause didn't feel like a victory so much as a quiet confirmation, like the satisfying tap of a joint slotting perfectly into place. It was the feeling of a thing made well, a thing that stood true.

She was working on restoring a set of old sash windows for a client in the Georgian Quarter, a job that required patience and a delicate touch. As she carefully scraped away decades of hardened putty from the original, slender glazing bars, her movements were steady and economical. But her mind was miles away, back on the small, bright stage of The Grapes. She replayed the moment her shaking fingers found the first chord, the shocking volume of it through the speakers, the way the silence after the last note had felt like a physical presence. The fear had been immense, but the feeling of building her song in that public space, of creating a solid, audible structure for all to hear, had been a revelation. It had been real. It had held its ground.

Around mid-morning, the bell on the workshop door chimed, a sound she usually registered with detached interest. She looked up from her bench to see a man silhouetted against the bright doorway. As he stepped inside, she recognized him immediately: the bearded man from the pub, the one who had played the intricate, haunting blues and given her that slow, appreciative nod. He was holding a long, rectangular case, far more battered than her own, its leather covering scuffed down to the raw hide in places. He looked around the workshop, his eyes taking in the hanging tools, the stacks of timber, the half-finished windows, with the same respect he’d shown the performers on stage.

"Clara Thorne," he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble that suited his music. "Knew I'd find you in a place like this. The song gave it away." He gestured around the room. "You write what you know, and you clearly know this." He smiled, a warm expression that crinkled the corners of his eyes. A flicker of her stage-fright returned, the reflexive urge to hide. She wiped her hands on her apron, a nervous gesture. "I'm Ben," he said, stepping forward. "That was a fine tune last night. It had good bones. Honest." He placed his battered case on her workbench. "Speaking of which, I was hoping you could look at this. It's taken a few too many tumbles. The frame's coming apart at the corners. Needs someone with an eye for a proper joint."

A wave of relief washed over Clara. This was a language she understood. A repair job. She ran her hand over the splintered corner of the case, diagnosing the problem instantly. A failed bridle joint, poorly made in the first place. "I can fix that," she said, her voice regaining its usual professional confidence. "I'd have to re-cut the joint, glue and clamp it. Maybe add a spline for strength." As she spoke, she saw the connection he had made so easily. The song had bones. The case needed a joint. The two worlds weren't just parallel; they were interwoven. She was explaining the principles of her craft, and he was nodding, understanding completely.

The door scraped open again, louder this time. The draft brought a familiar chill. Arthur stood there, a small cardboard box of router bits in his hand. He stopped dead, his gaze sweeping over the scene: Clara, animated, leaning over the bench with Ben; the battered guitar case sitting amidst her tools; her own black case propped against the wall where she’d left it that morning. A thundercloud passed over his face. He didn’t need an explanation. The evidence was all there, laid out like a confession. The air grew thick and heavy with his silent disapproval. Ben, sensing the sudden frost, took a step back from the bench. "Just getting a quote for a repair," he said, offering a friendly nod to Arthur.

Arthur ignored him completely. He walked to the workbench and placed the box of router bits down with a sharp, definitive click. His eyes, the same pale grey as Clara's, were hard as flint. He looked not at her, but at her hands, the hands he had trained, the hands he saw as his legacy. "I taught you to use these," he said, his voice quiet, but with an edge that could strip paint. "To build things that last. Chairs people can sit on. Roofs that keep out the rain." He finally looked at her, his expression a mixture of profound disappointment and something that looked like grief. "Not for this. This… noise." He flicked his eyes towards Ben with a look of pure contempt, seeing in him the ghost of his own feckless brother, the cautionary tale he had told a thousand times. He turned and walked out without another word, leaving the door ajar.

The silence Arthur left in his wake was more powerful than any sound. It was a vacuum, cold and absolute, that sucked all the warmth and camaraderie from the room. The hum of the lights seemed to amplify the crushing quiet. Ben shifted his weight, looking deeply uncomfortable. "Sorry," he mumbled, gesturing vaguely towards the door. "Looks like I stepped in something there." Clara couldn't answer. She felt hollowed out, the quiet confidence of the morning shattered. Her father’s words echoed in her head, each one a hammer blow: *Wasting your time. Noise.* He had seen her nascent joy and diagnosed it as a terminal illness.

After a few awkward moments, Ben cleared his throat. "Look, I'll leave you to it. Give me a call about the case when you get a chance." He scribbled a number on a scrap of paper and pushed it across the bench before retreating, leaving Clara alone in her now-violated sanctuary. For a long time, she just stood there, staring at the spot where her father had been. The workshop, once her refuge, felt like a courtroom where she had just been sentenced. She looked at the half-repaired window, at the neatly arranged chisels on her bench, at the box of brand-new router bits. They were all part of a world he had given her, a world that suddenly felt like a cage. Then her eyes fell on her own guitar, leaning against the wall. It was a silent witness to the entire confrontation. Slowly, deliberately, she crossed the room, lifted the instrument from its case, and sat on her well-worn woodworking stool. She didn't play her song. She didn't have the strength. Instead, her fingers found the shape of an E minor chord. She strummed it once, letting the deep, melancholic sound fill the heavy silence. It wasn't a lament. It was an answer.### Chapter 4

The E minor chord faded, but the silence that replaced it was different from the one her father had left behind. Arthur’s silence had been a weapon, a cold, heavy void. The silence that followed her guitar was a space she had carved for herself, filled with the lingering resonance of the note. It was a shelter. She sat on the stool for a long time, the guitar across her lap, simply breathing in the familiar air of her workshop, which now seemed layered with new and complex scents: cedar, tung oil, and the sharp, metallic tang of betrayal. The box of router bits her father had left sat on the bench, a small, perfect cube of disapproval. It was a peace offering and a final warning, a gift with the weight of an ultimatum.

The next day, work was a slog. The familiar, meditative rhythm she usually found in her tasks was gone, replaced by a jarring arrhythmia of thought. Her father’s words played on a loop in her head, each repetition sharpening their edges. *Noise. Wasting your time.* She was working on the sash windows, a job requiring precision and a steady hand, but her focus was shattered. A slip of a chisel gouged a sliver from a glazing bar she was meant to be restoring, a careless mistake she hadn't made since her apprenticeship. The small wound in the wood felt like a physical manifestation of her own turmoil. She stared at it, her cheeks burning with shame and a fresh spike of anger. She was a master of her craft. His words, his judgment, were turning her into a clumsy novice in her own sanctuary.

Frustrated, she abandoned the window and turned her attention to Ben’s battered guitar case. It was a tangible problem, a straightforward repair, and she needed the clarity of a simple task. She laid it on the bench, the worn leather cool beneath her fingers, and examined the broken corner. It was a simple, but catastrophic, failure. The joint had been poorly constructed, all glue and no structural integrity. Her father would have called it shoddy work, and he would have been right. As she carefully scraped away the old, dried glue and prepared to re-cut the bridle joint, she found herself working with a fierce, focused intensity. This was her language. This was her domain. She was not making noise; she was making things whole. She was taking something broken, something that carried music into the world, and she was mending it with the very skills her father had taught her.

As her hands moved with practiced certainty, her mind began to clear. She thought of Arthur, not with the hot anger of the previous day, but with a new, sad clarity. She saw him as a young man, watching his brother chase a dream that led to smoky pubs and unpaid bills. She understood that Arthur hadn't built his rigid worldview out of cruelty, but out of fear. He had seen the nebulous promise of music destroy someone he loved, and so he had built his own life out of solid, ninety-degree angles and provable truths, a fortress against the chaos. His condemnation of her wasn't just about a guitar; it was a desperate, clumsy attempt to protect her from the same fate, to keep her safe within the fortress walls he had built. The realisation didn’t excuse his harshness, but it gave it a shape, a history. It was a flaw she could see, a knot in the grain of the man she loved.

She finished the repair with a craftsman’s pride, fitting a new spline of dark walnut into the corner for added strength. The contrasting wood was a visible seam, a scar that told the story of the break and its mending. It was stronger than before. It had more character. When she was done, she buffed the old leather with wax, bringing a soft lustre back to its tired surface. The case sat on her bench, solid and renewed. The scrap of paper with Ben's number was still there, tucked under the new box of router bits. She looked from the repaired case to the phone on her desk, the two objects representing the two halves of her life. For a moment, they were at war. Then she realised they didn't have to be. Her hands, mapped with the faint white lines of old splinters, were the same hands that were slowly, painfully, learning to fret a clean F chord. They were a carpenter's hands. And a musician's. They were her hands.

Taking a deep breath, she picked up the phone and dialled. Ben answered on the second ring, his voice warm and immediate. "Clara Thorne! I was hoping you'd call. Did you decide my old case was a lost cause?"
"No," she said, a small smile touching her lips for the first time in two days. "It's done. It's stronger than it was before."
"You're a miracle worker," he laughed. "I'll swing by tomorrow to grab it. Hey, a few of us are getting together on Thursday night, over at my place. Just a casual jam, nothing formal, no spotlight. Just guitars and a few beers. You should come. Bring yours."
The invitation was so easy, so without pressure. It wasn't a stage; it was a living room. It wasn't a performance; it was a conversation. The old fear was still there, a faint tremor in the background, but it was overshadowed by a stronger feeling: a quiet, hopeful curiosity.
"Okay," she heard herself say, the word feeling both terrifying and right. "Yeah. I'd like that." When she hung up the phone, the workshop was silent, but it was a comfortable silence now, full of the quiet hum of possibility. She looked at the repaired guitar case and the new box of router bits, sitting side by side on her workbench, and saw not a conflict, but a harmony.The E minor chord faded, but the silence that replaced it was different from the one her father had left behind.

Thursday night arrived with a cold drizzle that slicked the pavements and blurred the streetlights into hazy coronas. Clara walked the unfamiliar streets to Ben’s address, the guitar case in her hand feeling less like an accusation and more like a potluck offering. She was nervous, but it was a different vintage of fear from the sharp, metallic terror of the open mic. This was the quiet anxiety of a first day in a new workshop, of not yet knowing the unspoken rules or where the tools were kept. Ben lived in a tall, narrow house squeezed between a laundrette and a takeaway, the kind of place her father would have dismissed as impractical. When he opened the door, a wave of warmth, smelling of brewing coffee and old paper, washed over her, a comforting contrast to the damp chill outside. The room was a chaotic library of music: vinyl records overflowed from makeshift shelves, books on folk history were piled on every surface, and a half-disassembled amplifier sat on the floor, its colourful wires exposed like viscera. It was the polar opposite of her own spartan flat, and far messier than her workshop, but it felt deeply, unapologetically alive.

A woman with a cascade of red hair and a warm smile looked up from a well-worn armchair. It was Sarah, the singer from the pub whose voice had seemed to command the very air. Next to her, a quiet man with kind eyes was carefully tuning a mandolin, its high, sweet notes pricking the air. He was introduced as Dave. There were no spotlights, no clipboards, no sense of an audience. The greetings were muted and casual, as if her presence was the most natural thing in the world. Ben handed her a beer, and she found a spot on the edge of the rug, placing her guitar case beside her, feeling like a visitor who had brought a foreign dish to a familiar feast. For a while, she just sat and listened as they talked, their conversation weaving easily between local news, the merits of different string gauges, and a story about a disastrous gig in Bristol. It was a language she didn't speak, but for the first time, she felt like she was being given a chance to learn.

The music started without fanfare. Ben, slouched comfortably on the sofa, began to strum a slow, simple twelve-bar blues in A. It was a foundational pattern, a piece of structural timber she recognised from her online tutorials. After a few bars, Dave joined in, his mandolin playing not a melody, but a series of rhythmic, percussive chops that landed perfectly in the spaces Ben’s guitar left open. Then Sarah began to sing, her voice low and smoky, humming a wordless melody that coiled around the two instruments like ivy. Clara watched, mesmerised. It wasn't a performance. It was a construction. They were building something together, in real time, each one listening intently and adding their piece to the whole. They passed the lead back and forth with subtle nods and glances, a silent communication she had never witnessed before. It was a form of joinery, each musician a different tool, working together on the same piece of wood.

After a few songs, Ben caught her eye. He didn't say anything, just gave a slight, encouraging tilt of his head towards her guitar case. The invitation was gentle, a door left ajar rather than a summons. Her heart gave a familiar, nervous kick, but she found herself reaching for the latches. She took out her guitar, the polished brown wood seeming plain and quiet next to Ben’s scarred and road-weary dreadnought. "Know 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken'?" Sarah asked, her voice soft. Clara nodded. It was one of the first three-chord songs in her beginner’s book. "Just follow along," Ben said. "G, C, and D. You can't go wrong." He started the simple, familiar rhythm, and Sarah’s voice rose, pure and clear. Clara took a breath and placed her fingers in the shape of a G chord. Her first strum was timid, barely audible beneath the other instruments, but it was there. She was a part of the sound.

She focused entirely on the chords, her world shrinking to the fretboard and the rhythm. G... G... C... G... Her changes were a fraction of a second behind the others, her strumming stiff and metronomic compared to their easy, breathing pulse. On the second verse, her mind momentarily blanked. She was supposed to go to a D, but her fingers fumbled, producing a choked, buzzing sound that made her wince. She froze, braced for the song to fall apart, for the music to halt in dissonant failure. But nothing happened. Ben’s rhythm remained rock-solid, Dave’s mandolin continued its cheerful chop, and Sarah, without missing a beat, gave her a quick, conspiratorial smile. No one had stopped. No one had even seemed to notice. The song had simply absorbed her mistake, its forward momentum carrying her past the error. She took a breath, found the D chord a beat late, and fell back into the rhythm. It was a profound lesson. In her workshop, a mistake had to be fixed, planed away, or the whole structure was compromised. Here, the structure was fluid, supported by the collective will of the players. The goal wasn't perfection; it was communion.

They played for what felt like hours, moving through a landscape of old folk songs and simple blues progressions. Clara never sang a word. She didn't offer a melody. Her contribution was humble, a quiet layer of rhythm holding down the harmony. But with every song, her strumming loosened, her chord changes grew more confident, and she started to anticipate the shifts, watching Ben’s hands, listening to the subtle cues in Sarah’s voice. She was learning to listen not just to her own instrument, but to the entire shape of the sound in the room. By the end of the night, as they sat drinking the last of the coffee, laughing about a misremembered lyric, she felt a warmth in her chest that had nothing to do with the beer. It was the quiet, sturdy glow of belonging.

Walking home through the now-empty streets, the drizzle having softened to a fine mist, Clara felt a deep sense of peace. The weight of the guitar on her shoulder was no longer a burden of ambition, but the comfortable weight of a shared experience. Back in her workshop the next morning, the world seemed re-tuned. She looked at the set of sash windows, at the complex interplay of frame, sash, weight, and pulley. She had always seen it as a clever piece of engineering, a series of individual parts. Now she saw it as a collaboration. Each component had to work in concert, listening to the others, for the whole to function with that silent, graceful glide. A flaw in one part affected them all. A success in one part lifted the whole. She thought of her father, alone in his workshop, in his fortress of perfect, solitary joints. A wave of sadness washed over her, not for herself, but for him. He had taught her how to build things that were solid and true, but he had never taught her how to build them with other people. She picked up a plane to smooth the edge of a newly repaired glazing bar, and as the blade whispered across the wood, she began to hum, not her song, but the harmony Sarah had sung the night before.Thursday night arrived with a cold drizzle that slicked the pavements and blurred the streetlights into hazy coronas.

The room was a chaotic library of music: vinyl records overflowed from makeshift shelves, books on folk history were piled on every surface, and a half-disassembled amplifier sat on the floor, its colourful wires exposed like viscera. It was the polar opposite of her own spartan flat, and far messier than her workshop, but it felt deeply, unapologetically alive.

A woman with a cascade of red hair and a warm smile looked up from a well-worn armchair. It was Sarah, the singer from the pub whose voice had seemed to command the very air. Next to her, a quiet man with kind eyes was carefully tuning a mandolin, its high, sweet notes pricking the air. He was introduced as Dave. There were no spotlights, no clipboards, no sense of an audience. The greetings were muted and casual, as if her presence was the most natural thing in the world. Ben handed her a beer, and she found a spot on the edge of the rug, placing her guitar case beside her, feeling like a visitor who had brought a foreign dish to a familiar feast. For a while, she just sat and listened as they talked, their conversation weaving easily between local news, the merits of different string gauges, and a story about a disastrous gig in Bristol. It was a language she didn't speak, but for the first time, she felt like she was being given a chance to learn.

The music started without fanfare. Ben, slouched comfortably on the sofa, began to strum a slow, simple twelve-bar blues in A. It was a foundational pattern, a piece of structural timber she recognised from her online tutorials. After a few bars, Dave joined in, his mandolin playing not a melody, but a series of rhythmic, percussive chops that landed perfectly in the spaces Ben’s guitar left open. Then Sarah began to sing, her voice low and smoky, humming a wordless melody that coiled around the two instruments like ivy. Clara watched, mesmerised. It wasn't a performance. It was a construction. They were building something together, in real time, each one listening intently and adding their piece to the whole. They passed the lead back and forth with subtle nods and glances, a silent communication she had never witnessed before. It was a form of joinery, each musician a different tool, working together on the same piece of wood.

After a few songs, Ben caught her eye. He didn't say anything, just gave a slight, encouraging tilt of his head towards her guitar case. The invitation was gentle, a door left ajar rather than a summons. Her heart gave a familiar, nervous kick, but she found herself reaching for the latches. She took out her guitar, the polished brown wood seeming plain and quiet next to Ben’s scarred and road-weary dreadnought. "Know 'Will the Circle Be Unbroken'?" Sarah asked, her voice soft. Clara nodded. It was one of the first three-chord songs in her beginner’s book. "Just follow along," Ben said. "G, C, and D. You can't go wrong." He started the simple, familiar rhythm, and Sarah’s voice rose, pure and clear. Clara took a breath and placed her fingers in the shape of a G chord. Her first strum was timid, barely audible beneath the other instruments, but it was there. She was a part of the sound.

She focused entirely on the chords, her world shrinking to the fretboard and the rhythm. G... G... C... G... Her changes were a fraction of a second behind the others, her strumming stiff and metronomic compared to their easy, breathing pulse. On the second verse, her mind momentarily blanked. She was supposed to go to a D, but her fingers fumbled, producing a choked, buzzing sound that made her wince. She froze, braced for the song to fall apart, for the music to halt in dissonant failure. But nothing happened. Ben’s rhythm remained rock-solid, Dave’s mandolin continued its cheerful chop, and Sarah, without missing a beat, gave her a quick, conspiratorial smile. No one had stopped. No one had even seemed to notice. The song had simply absorbed her mistake, its forward momentum carrying her past the error. She took a breath, found the D chord a beat late, and fell back into the rhythm. It was a profound lesson. In her workshop, a mistake had to be fixed, planed away, or the whole structure was compromised. Here, the structure was fluid, supported by the collective will of the players. The goal wasn't perfection; it was communion.

They played for what felt like hours, moving through a landscape of old folk songs and simple blues progressions. Clara never sang a word. She didn't offer a melody. Her contribution was humble, a quiet layer of rhythm holding down the harmony. But with every song, her strumming loosened, her chord changes grew more confident, and she started to anticipate the shifts, watching Ben’s hands, listening to the subtle cues in Sarah’s voice. She was learning to listen not just to her own instrument, but to the entire shape of the sound in the room. By the end of the night, as they sat drinking the last of the coffee, laughing about a misremembered lyric, she felt a warmth in her chest that had nothing to do with the beer. It was the quiet, sturdy glow of belonging.

Walking home through the now-empty streets, the drizzle having softened to a fine mist, Clara felt a deep sense of peace. The weight of the guitar on her shoulder was no longer a burden of ambition, but the comfortable weight of a shared experience. Back in her workshop the next morning, the world seemed re-tuned. She looked at the set of sash windows, at the complex interplay of frame, sash, weight, and pulley. She had always seen it as a clever piece of engineering, a series of individual parts. Now she saw it as a collaboration. Each component had to work in concert, listening to the others, for the whole to function with that silent, graceful glide. A flaw in one part affected them all. A success in one part lifted the whole. She thought of her father, alone in his workshop, in his fortress of perfect, solitary joints. A wave of sadness washed over her, not for herself, but for him. He had taught her how to build things that were solid and true, but he had never taught her how to build them with other people. She picked up a plane to smooth the edge of a newly repaired glazing bar, and as the blade whispered across the wood, she began to hum, not her song, but the harmony Sarah had sung the night before.### Chapter 6

The hum of the harmony stayed with her. It became a new tool in the workshop, an invisible gauge for balance and flow. The sash windows, which had once been a purely mechanical puzzle, now presented themselves as a composition. The smooth glide of the restored weights in their channels was a perfect resolution, the gentle click of the lock a final, satisfying chord. Her work became more intuitive, her hands moving with a fluid confidence that went beyond muscle memory. The small, angry gouge she had made in the glazing bar was now filled and sanded, a tiny, almost invisible scar. It was no longer a mark of her father’s disapproval, but a reminder of her own brief dissonance before finding a new key. The music hadn't distracted her from her craft; it had deepened her understanding of it, tuning her senses to the subtle rhythms and harmonies inherent in the wood itself.

The following Thursday, she went back to Ben’s house. This time, walking through the drizzle with her guitar case, she felt a quiet thrum of anticipation instead of dread. When the music started, she was a more active participant. She watched their hands, anticipated the changes, and her simple, rhythmic strumming became a steady floorboard upon which the more ornate melodies of the others could dance. Halfway through the night, during a pause, Ben nodded towards her. "You got any of your own?" he asked, his tone casual, curious. "The one from the pub was a beauty." Clara felt a blush creep up her neck, but it was warm, not hot. "It's not really finished," she demurred, the old habit of self-deprecation dying hard. "Just play us the bones of it," Sarah encouraged, her smile taking the pressure off. "We're all friends here. No critics."

Hesitantly, she began. She played the simple G-C-E minor progression, her strumming steady. She sang the first verse, her voice quiet but clear in the small, attentive room. *'Hands mapped with faint white lines / a language of the grain and time.'* When she reached the chorus, she just hummed the simple, four-note melody. As she did, Sarah, listening with her head tilted, began to hum a harmony a third above it, a clean, perfect line of sonic dovetailing that lifted the plain melody into something soaring. At the same time, Dave picked out a delicate, sparse counter-melody on his mandolin, each note a small, bright fleck of inlay against the dark wood of Clara's chords. She faltered for a second, stunned by the sudden, beautiful complexity of what she was hearing. Her simple tune, her private little blueprint, was now a fully realised structure, a house being built around her. She looked up from her fretboard, met their smiling, encouraging eyes, and for the first time, played her song all the way through with a sense of boundless, collaborative joy.

A week later, on a bright Saturday morning, Arthur returned. He came without warning, as always, but this time he carried no offerings or ultimatums. He was carrying a problem. It was a thick, unruly slab of burr oak, its surface a chaotic whorl of knots and figuring. He laid it carefully on her workbench. "The new bandsaw," he said, not looking at her. "You've got a finer blade on it than I have. This wood keeps tearing out." He was building a small, intricate box for a wealthy client, and the curved lid he had designed was proving impossible to cut cleanly. It was a massive concession, an unspoken admission that her tools, and perhaps her skills, surpassed his in some small way. It was the first time in her life he had ever come to her for help.

They stood side-by-side at the bandsaw, the air thick with unspoken words. The setup was a tense, silent ballet of professional respect. He held the wood, his big, weathered hands guiding its weight, and she controlled the feed, her touch on the wood delicate but firm as she guided it into the screaming blade. They didn’t speak. They communicated through the pressure of their hands, the subtle shift of weight, the shared focus on the thin, black line of the cut. The machine whined, its pitch rising and falling as the blade navigated the dense, unpredictable grain of the oak. He was trusting her eye, her feel for the tool. As she guided the wood through the final, sweeping curve of the design, she felt his hands relax their grip slightly, ceding control to her. For that moment, they were not father and daughter, not master and apprentice. They were two craftspeople, working together in perfect, silent harmony.

When she switched off the saw, the sudden silence was immense. Arthur picked up the newly cut piece, turning it over and over. The cut was flawless, a smooth, flowing line that followed his pencil mark to a hair's breadth. He ran a thumb over the edge. "Good hands," he murmured, the old, familiar praise. He paused, then added, his voice low and gruff, "That... noise... doesn't seem to have ruined your eye." It was the closest he could get to an apology, an olive branch carved from his own stubborn timber. Clara took a breath, the scent of the freshly cut oak sharp and clean. "It's the same thing, Dad," she said, her voice quiet but steady. "It's about finding the line. The one that feels right. The one that flows." She gestured from the oak lid to the bandsaw. "It's like that cut. You were holding the piece, I was guiding the blade. We both had to listen to the wood, to the machine, to each other. That's all it is. Playing music with other people. You just... listen for your part."

He didn't understand, not really. She could see it in the deep-set confusion in his eyes. A song would never be an oak box to him. He shook his head slowly, a gesture of ingrained disbelief. "Hmph," he grunted. But the sound was different. The hard, dismissive edge was gone, replaced by a note of deep, weary puzzlement. The fortress was still standing, but he was staring at a crack in his own wall. He carefully wrapped the piece of oak in a cloth and turned to go. At the door, he stopped and looked back, not at Clara, but at the workshop around her—the neat stacks of wood, the gleaming tools, the air of quiet, productive purpose. "Your mother's brother," he said, his voice barely audible. "He never finished anything." Then he was gone, leaving Clara alone in the humming silence. She looked down at the fine, golden dust from his burr oak, mingled with the paler dust from her own pine, covering the table of her bandsaw. She was not her uncle. She finished things. She had just finished her song. And now, she finally understood how to build a bridge.The hum of the harmony stayed with her.

She looked down at the fine, golden dust from his burr oak, mingled with the paler dust from her own pine, covering the table of her bandsaw. She was not her uncle. She finished things. She had just finished her song. And now, she finally understood how to build a bridge.

The idea took root over the next few days, a quiet, insistent shoot pushing up through the sawdust. A bridge wasn't something you could build alone. It required an anchor point on both sides of the divide. The next time she saw her father, she chose her moment carefully. He was inspecting the finish on the sash windows she had just completed, his critical eye scanning for imperfections. He found none. As he gave a final, approving nod, Clara took a breath. "I'm having a few friends over to the workshop on Saturday evening," she said, her tone as matter-of-fact as if she were discussing a lumber delivery. "I'd like you to be there." He looked at her, his suspicion immediately aroused. "What for? You having a party in here?" he asked, his gaze sweeping the pristine workspace with a protective frown. "It's not a party," she said calmly. "It's just… a few people. From my other work." She let the ambiguity hang in the air, a space for him to fill with his own assumptions or curiosity. He just stared at her, then gave a noncommittal shrug. "I'll see," he said, which in his language was as close to a ‘yes’ as she was likely to get.

On Saturday, Clara transformed the workshop. She didn’t try to hide what it was; she celebrated it. She swept the floors, but left a fine layer of clean sawdust that smelled sweetly of pine. She arranged a few upturned timber crates and sturdy offcuts of oak as makeshift stools and tables, their surfaces planed smooth. A string of simple, warm-toned work lights was hung between the rafters, casting a soft, golden glow that made the hanging tools on the walls gleam like arcane instruments. The air was thick with its usual meal of cedar and oil, but tonight, there was an undercurrent of something else: anticipation. When Ben, Sarah, and Dave arrived, their eyes widened. "Clara, this is amazing," Sarah breathed, running a hand over the polished surface of Clara’s main workbench. "It smells like… like something real." They set up in a small cleared space near the front, their battered instrument cases looking perfectly at home amongst the wood and machinery.

Her father arrived last. He stood in the doorway for a long moment, taking in the scene with a stony expression. He saw the musicians, the work lights, the makeshift seating. His pale eyes flicked to Clara, a question and an accusation in them. She just gave him a small, steady nod and pointed to a solid-looking stool she had made from a section of a beech tree trunk, placing it slightly apart from the others, giving him a safe harbour. He sat down stiffly, his back straight, looking like a man waiting for a verdict. The music started gently, Ben leading them into a slow, meandering folk tune. The sound was different in here. The high ceilings of the old stable, the wood-panelled walls, the very sawdust on the floor seemed to soak up the notes and give them back warmer, richer. Arthur sat rigid, his hands on his knees, his face an unreadable mask of stoicism. He was enduring it, a guest in a foreign land.

Then, after a few songs, Ben looked at Clara. "Your house, your rules," he said with a smile. "Play the one." All eyes turned to her, including her father's. Her heart began to beat its familiar, frantic rhythm, but this time it was different. She wasn't an impostor. This was her stage, her sanctuary. She took a breath, the comforting scent of her own world filling her lungs, and she began to play her song. She started with the simple G chord, its sound full and resonant in the room she had built. And she sang, her voice clear and sure, not for an audience, but for an audience of one. *"'Hands mapped with faint white lines...'"* She saw her father’s head lift slightly. *"'A meal of cedar dust and tung oil...'"* His gaze shifted from his own hands to hers, moving on the fretboard. She sang of the right angles and flush joints, of the patient rasp of a plane, of the definitive thud of a mortise and tenon. She wasn't just singing words; she was translating her life, his life, their shared world, into his brother’s language.

When she reached the final verse, the one about the rebellious curve in the banister, she looked directly at him. *"'A flaw is not a flaw / when it helps a story sing...'"* The final chord, her foundational E minor, hung in the air, its deep, melancholy vibration seeming to settle into the very grain of the room. A profound silence followed. Ben, Sarah and Dave were still, watching, understanding that something more than a song had just been played. Arthur sat unmoving on his beech stool. He didn't clap. He didn't smile. But he slowly, deliberately, met her gaze across the sawdust-strewn floor. He gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. It wasn't forgiveness. It wasn't conversion. It was acknowledgement. In that silent, shared glance, the bridge was built. It was a simple, sturdy structure, made not of music or of wood, but of a shared, hard-won understanding. He finally saw that what she had built was not noise. It was a story. And it was useful.### Chapter 7

The single nod hung in the air long after Arthur had gone. He hadn’t said a word. After the song ended and the resonant silence had settled, he had simply stood up, placed the beech stool back against the wall with the care he would afford a finished piece of furniture, and walked out into the night. He left behind a space that felt fundamentally altered, consecrated. The air, still holding the final E minor chord, was thick with a new kind of peace. Ben, Sarah, and Dave were quiet for a long moment, respecting the gravity of what they had just witnessed. Then Sarah broke the silence, her voice soft. "Well," she said, raising her half-empty bottle of beer. "I think that's what you call a successful housewarming." A slow smile spread across Clara's face, a genuine, unburdened smile that reached her eyes. The tension she had carried for months, a tight, knotted grain in her own body, had finally been planed smooth. They didn’t play any more songs that night. Instead, they sat amongst the tools and the timber, talking quietly while the work lights cast long, warm shadows, the four of them a small, sturdy structure in the heart of the old stable.

The workshop became their regular sanctuary. The Thursday night jam sessions migrated permanently from Ben’s chaotic living room to the sawdust-scented air of the converted stable. At first, it felt strange to Clara, this blending of her two worlds. Her chisels, hanging in their neat, silent ranks, became the audience. The stoic, heavy presence of the table saw seemed to listen with quiet judgment. But soon, the dissonance faded into harmony. The rhythmic chop of Dave’s mandolin felt as natural as the thud of her mallet. Sarah’s voice, rising in the high-ceilinged space, seemed to polish the very air. Ben would lean his chair back against a stack of pine boards, his foot tapping out a beat on the concrete floor, and the two distinct parts of Clara’s life began to speak to each other in a shared language. The scent of rosin from Ben’s bow would mingle with the smell of cedar, creating a fragrance that was entirely new, entirely theirs. She was no longer a carpenter who played music in secret; she was simply Clara, and this was her space, a room where things were built, whether from wood or from sound.

Her reputation as a carpenter was also beginning to shift. Word of the barrister’s staircase, of its “poetic” and unconventional line, had travelled through the quiet, interconnected world of architects and designers. A new commission came in, not a repair job or a set of rigid plans, but a request to design and build a reading bench for a small, public garden. The brief was a single paragraph, ending with the line: "We want a piece that invites quiet contemplation, something that feels like it grew there." It was a luthier’s instruction given to a carpenter, a request for resonance and feeling, not just function. She took on the project with a quiet thrill, spending days sketching not just shapes, but moods. She chose a piece of English oak, tracing its grain as if it were a melody, letting the wood itself dictate the gentle, flowing curves of the seat and back, creating a design that was a silent, solid song.

Her own songwriting, however, proved a tougher knot to untangle. The first song had been a raw outpouring, a thing of necessity pulled from her like a stubborn splinter. Now, when she sat with her guitar in the quiet of her flat, she felt a different kind of pressure. She was trying to *write* a song, to craft it deliberately, and the effort felt forced and hollow. Her notebook filled with false starts and clumsy metaphors. The words felt like ill-fitting joints, the melodies like awkward, unnatural curves. She complained about it one Thursday, frustrated. "It’s like I've forgotten how to hold the tools," she said. Ben, wiping down a guitar string, just smiled. "The first one is a testimony," he said. "The second one is work. It's the same as your day job, isn't it? You can't force a dovetail. You have to measure, mark, be patient, and trust the process. Find a piece of honest grain and follow it." His words clicked into place with the satisfying thud of a mortise and tenon. She had been trying to invent a story, when all she had to do was tell one.

The following week, Ben came into the workshop waving a flyer. It was for a local folk festival, a well-respected weekend event that drew crowds from all over the region. "They have a stage for new acts," he said, his eyes bright with an excitement that made Clara’s stomach clench. "I sent them a rough recording I made on my phone of your song from the other night, the one we all played on." Clara stared at him, horrified. "You did what?" "And they've offered us a slot," he continued, unstoppable. "A forty-five-minute set. Saturday afternoon. All four of us." He beamed at her, oblivious to the sudden, cold panic that was flooding her system. This wasn't a handful of listeners in a dim pub or a safe circle of friends. This was a real festival, a proper stage, a paying audience. It was a formal declaration. It was taking the frame they had built together and entering it into an exhibition.

The fear was immediate and immense, but it was a different fear. It was not the fear of her father's disapproval or of being a fraud. It was the honest, practical fear of a craftsperson facing a job that was a stretch, a project that would test the very limits of her skill. A forty-five-minute set. That meant more songs. That meant arrangements, practice, a setlist. It meant standing on a stage not as a surprise, but as an expectation. She looked around her workshop, at the half-finished reading bench on her trestles, its gentle curves waiting for her patient hand. She thought of the careful joinery, the slow process of building something strong enough to bear weight. This was the same. It was just a larger construction. She looked at her friends, at their hopeful, expectant faces. She wasn’t building this alone. She looked at the old guitar, the one she'd found in an attic, resting in its open case. It had been a piece of salvage, a problem to be solved. And it had been. Looking back at Ben, she gave a single, decisive nod, the echo of her father's. "Alright," Clara Thorne said, wiping her dusty hands on her apron. "Let's build a set."The single nod hung in the air long after Arthur had gone. He hadn’t said a word. After the song ended and the resonant silence had settled, he had simply stood up, placed the beech stool back against the wall with the care he would afford a finished piece of furniture, and walked out into the night. He left behind a space that felt fundamentally altered, consecrated. The air, still holding the final E minor chord, was thick with a new kind of peace.

"Well," she said, raising her half-empty bottle of beer. "I think that's what you call a successful housewarming."

Now, when she sat with her guitar in the quiet of her flat, she felt a different kind of pressure. She was trying to *write* a song, to craft it deliberately, and the effort felt forced and hollow. Her notebook filled with false starts and clumsy metaphors. The words felt like ill-fitting joints, the melodies like awkward, unnatural curves. She complained about it one Thursday, frustrated. "It’s like I've forgotten how to hold the tools," she said. Ben, wiping down a guitar string, just smiled. "The first one is a testimony," he said. "The second one is work. It's the same as your day job, isn't it? You can't force a dovetail. You have to measure, mark, be patient, and trust the process. Find a piece of honest grain and follow it." His words clicked into place with the satisfying thud of a mortise and tenon. She had been trying to invent a story, when all she had to do was tell one.

The following week, Ben came into the workshop waving a flyer. It was for a local folk festival, a well-respected weekend event that drew crowds from all over the region. "They have a stage for new acts," he said, his eyes bright with an excitement that made Clara’s stomach clench. "I sent them a rough recording I made on my phone of your song from the other night, the one we all played on." Clara stared at him, horrified. "You did what?" "And they've offered us a slot," he continued, unstoppable. "A forty-five-minute set. Saturday afternoon. All four of us." He beamed at her, oblivious to the sudden, cold panic that was flooding her system. This wasn't a handful of listeners in a dim pub or a safe circle of friends. This was a real festival, a proper stage, a paying audience. It was a formal declaration. It was taking the frame they had built together and entering it into an exhibition. The fear was immediate and immense, but it was a different fear. It was not the fear of her father's disapproval or of being a fraud. It was the honest, practical fear of a craftsperson facing a job that was a stretch, a project that would test the very limits of her skill. A forty-five-minute set. That meant more songs. That meant arrangements, practice, a setlist. It meant standing on a stage not as a surprise, but as an expectation. She looked around her workshop, at the half-finished reading bench on her trestles, its gentle curves waiting for her patient hand. She thought of the careful joinery, the slow process of building something strong enough to bear weight. This was the same. It was just a larger construction. She looked at her friends, at their hopeful, expectant faces. She wasn’t building this alone. She looked at the old guitar, the one she'd found in an attic, resting in its open case. It had been a piece of salvage, a problem to be solved. And it had been. Looking back at Ben, she gave a single, decisive nod, the echo of her father's. "Alright," Clara Thorne said, wiping her dusty hands on her apron. "Let's build a set."### Chapter 8

The decision, once made, settled in the workshop with the weight of a fresh delivery of oak. Forty-five minutes. It was an abstract, terrifyingly vast expanse of time. That first evening after agreeing, they stood around a large piece of clean plywood set on a pair of sawhorses. Ben, holding a piece of chalk, drew a line down the middle. “Songs we know,” he wrote on one side, listing a half-dozen folk and blues standards. On the other side, he wrote, “Songs we have.” Underneath, he chalked a single entry: ‘Clara’s Song (The Carpenter)’. The blank space beneath it seemed to mock them, a vast, un-planked floor. The reality of the task was stark. They didn't just need to practice; they needed to build, and their supply of raw material was dangerously low. Clara looked at the empty column and felt the familiar, cold dread of a looming deadline with insufficient stock. It wasn’t just about filling the time; it was about building a set that had structure, integrity, a story that would carry an audience from the first note to the last.

True to Ben’s advice, the second song refused to be forced. Clara would sit in her quiet flat, the guitar across her lap, her notebook open, and a kind of creative paralysis would set in. She tried to write about the things she thought songs should be about—love, loss, the open road—but the words came out like cheap, flat-pack furniture, full of clumsy angles and fake wood grain. They were someone else’s stories, and her voice stumbled over them. The frustration was a physical thing, a tension in her shoulders that even a long day of planing timber couldn’t undo. She was a craftsperson without a blueprint, a builder with a pile of mismatched parts. The more she tried to be a ‘songwriter’, the further she got from the simple, honest grain of her own experience that had yielded the first tune.

The breakthrough came not in her flat, but in the workshop, during a moment of quiet, manual labour. She was sorting through a pile of salvaged timber from a recent clear-out, a collection of old sash frames and floorboards destined for a new life. As she lifted a dusty length of Victorian pine, the faint, sweet smell of its amber resin hit her, and she was instantly transported back to the attic near St Thomas. She could feel the gloom, the chill in the air, the dust motes dancing in the beam of her head torch. She remembered the estate agent’s casual dismissal—"chuck any rubbish"—and the solemn stillness of the black case tucked under the yellowed sheets. It wasn’t a story she had to invent; it was a story she had found. She put down the board, picked up a pencil, and on the back of a delivery docket, she started to write. She didn’t write about her feelings; she wrote about the house. *'Lingering smell of damp and fried bacon / trapped inside the paper on the wall.'* The words were plain, observational, true. The song became a story of salvaged things: the tight-grained floorboards, the forgotten instrument, the spark of curiosity in a person who usually sanded it away. It wasn't just about the guitar; it was about the profound, quiet beauty of things that are overlooked.

She brought the new song to the next rehearsal, her hands trembling slightly as she unfolded the crumpled docket. She presented it as a problem to be solved, a rough-sawn piece of timber. "It's just a sketch," she mumbled, "The melody is a bit plain." She played it for them, her voice hesitant, the chord progression simple and melancholy. When she finished, a rich silence filled the workshop. "Plain is good," Ben said finally, his voice soft. "Plain is honest." He began to play a simple, descending bassline on his own guitar, a foundational support that gave her simple chords a new depth and forward motion. Sarah, listening intently, found a harmony for the chorus that didn't soar, but shadowed Clara's voice, a subtle, supportive presence like a hand on the small of her back. Dave added a delicate, chiming mandolin riff between the verses, little flecks of light in the dusty gloom of the song's narrative. Within an hour, her sketch had become a fully rendered piece, a solid structure built by four sets of hands. She looked at them, her heart full, and understood. This was how it worked. You brought the honest wood, and together, you built the house.

With two original songs as the main structural posts, the rest of the set began to take shape around them. The traditional songs they chose were no longer just filler; they became connecting beams and decorative joists. They took "Wayfaring Stranger," a song of solitary wandering, and rearranged it. Clara, thinking in terms of tension and release, suggested a change. "It feels like it's all one level," she'd said. "What if we strip it right back in the second verse, almost to just a whisper, and then build it up again?" They tried it, hollowing out the sound until it was just Sarah’s hushed voice and the faint chop of Dave’s mandolin, before bringing all the instruments crashing back in for the final verse. The effect was dramatic and powerful. The workshop, once a place of solitary creation, was now a laboratory of sound, full of chalk dust, coffee cups, and the rich, layered noise of a band finding its voice.

"We need a name," Dave said one evening, looking at the plywood setlist, where Ben had simply written ‘Clara & Co.’ at the top. The name felt wrong, lopsided. "The Dovetails?" Sarah suggested, smiling. "A bit on the nose," Ben countered. "How about The Dustbowl Drifters?" "We're from Liverpool, Ben, not Oklahoma," Clara laughed. She looked around the workshop, at the warm, golden light catching the motes of wood dust, at the deep, rich colour of the old pine board she'd been holding when she wrote the second song. She thought of the hardened sap, the preserved heart of the tree, beautiful and resilient. "What about Amber Resin?" she said quietly. The words hung in the air. It was perfect. It spoke of their sound—warm, organic, rooted in something old and preserved. It spoke of her workshop, of the very air they breathed. It spoke of finding something beautiful and lasting trapped inside the plain and everyday. Ben picked up his chalk and, with a flourish, wiped away ‘Clara & Co.’, writing ‘The Amber Resin Band’ in its place. It looked right. It looked solid.

The rehearsals intensified, the workshop filled night after night with their evolving sound. They ran the set from start to finish, sanding the rough transitions, polishing the arrangements, learning to breathe and move as a single entity. Clara found herself taking solos, not flashy displays of virtuosity, but simple, melodic passages that served the song, her fingers, once so clumsy, now moving with a newfound confidence and grace. She was still a carpenter, her hands still mapped with the faint white lines of her trade, but they were being re-drawn, the calluses of the workshop overlaid with the tender, hardened pads of a guitarist.

On the morning of the festival, Clara delivered the reading bench. She installed it herself in the small public garden, under the shade of a sprawling beech tree. It looked as though it had always been there, its gentle oak curves a quiet invitation. As she was packing her tools, her father’s truck pulled up. He got out, a flimsy excuse about checking a nearby supplier on his lips, and walked over to the bench. He didn’t say anything, just ran his hand along the flowing backrest, his expert eye taking in the seamless joinery, the perfect finish. "Good work," he said finally, the highest praise. Clara just nodded, wiping her hands on her jeans. "We're playing today," she said, her voice even. "At the festival. The New Shoots stage. Four o'clock." She met his gaze, holding it for a second. "They're calling us Amber Resin." She didn’t ask him to come. She didn't need to. The invitation was in the shared air, in the solid, beautiful thing they were both admiring. She turned and walked away towards the festival grounds, not looking back, leaving him with the choice. In the distance, she could see the canvas roof of the stage, a pale peak against the blue sky, waiting.The walk from the quiet garden to the festival grounds was a journey between two worlds. The scent of cut grass and damp earth gave way to a new atmosphere, a meal of hot-dog onions, sweet candyfloss, and the faint, electric hum of amplification. The distant thud of a bass drum grew louder with every step, a steady, primal heartbeat pulling her forward. The festival was in full swing, a sprawling, chaotic city of canvas and people. Families sat on picnic blankets, couples danced on the grass, and everywhere there was the sound of music bleeding from different stages, a cacophony that somehow resolved into a joyful, vibrant whole. Clara, guitar case in hand, moved through the throng feeling strangely invisible and hyper-aware at the same time. This was a world built not of wood, but of wire, canvas, and fleeting moments of shared sound, and for the first time, she was here not just as a visitor, but as a small part of its construction.

She found the ‘New Shoots’ stage tucked away in a small copse of trees, a more intimate setup than the giant main stage. A simple canvas roof sheltered the wooden platform, and a few hundred people were already gathered on the grass, listening to a fiery bluegrass trio. Ben, Sarah, and Dave were waiting for her by a small tent designated as the artists’ area. The air inside was close and smelled of coffee and nerves. They were all experiencing their own private versions of stage fright. Dave was meticulously polishing his mandolin, a repetitive, meditative motion. Sarah was doing quiet vocal warm-ups, her hums barely audible. Ben was pacing the small confines of the tent like a caged animal, re-reading the chalk-dusted plywood setlist he had insisted on bringing with them. Seeing them, Clara’s own anxiety lessened. It wasn't a solitary burden; it was a shared load, a heavy piece of timber they were all lifting together.

“There she is,” Ben said, his pacing stopping as she entered. “The master builder. Ready to raise the roof?” His attempt at bravado was thin, but Clara appreciated it. She unlatched her guitar case, the familiar clicks a small, grounding ritual. She checked the tuning, her fingers moving over the strings with a practiced touch. This was familiar territory. The instrument was a tool, and she knew how to use it. They didn't talk much. They each inhabited their own bubble of quiet focus, a shared understanding passing between them in glances and small nods. They were a team of craftspeople preparing for a complex and public installation. Every joint had been cut, every piece sanded. All that was left was the final, nerve-wracking assembly in front of a live audience.

A stage manager with a headset and a clipboard poked his head into the tent. “Amber Resin Band? You’re on in five.” A fresh jolt of adrenaline shot through the small space. They gathered their instruments, a final check of straps and picks. Ben gave Clara’s shoulder a quick squeeze. "Just like in the workshop," he murmured. "Just a few more people." They walked from the tent towards the side of the stage. Through the gap in the canvas, Clara could see the bluegrass band take their final bow to a wave of enthusiastic applause. The audience was bigger than she had anticipated, a sea of faces turned towards the stage, expectant. Her throat went dry. For a terrifying moment, all the notes, all the words, all the confident harmonies they had built in the safety of the workshop, evaporated, leaving only a vast, empty silence in her mind.

Then Sarah came to stand beside her, close enough that their shoulders touched. “Look at all that good timber,” Sarah whispered, nodding towards the crowd. The simple, absurd carpentry joke was an anchor in the swirling panic. Clara looked out at the people, not as a faceless mob of judges, but as individuals, each one a story, a collection of experiences. They were just people who had come to listen. The stage manager gave them the signal. Dave led the way, then Sarah, then Ben. Clara took a deep breath, the air tasting of electricity, and followed them out into the bright, consuming light.

The applause that greeted them was polite but welcoming. As she took her place and plugged in her guitar, the heat of the stage lights felt like a physical weight. She adjusted the microphone, her hands slick with sweat, and dared a glance out into the crowd. It was a dizzying mosaic of colour and movement. She quickly looked down, focusing on the worn, familiar wood of her guitar. She caught Ben’s eye, and he gave her a quick, confident nod. They were ready. Ben stepped up to his microphone. “Good afternoon. We’re The Amber Resin Band. It’s good to be here.” He looked at Clara, and with a silent count, he kicked them into the opening chords of "Wayfaring Stranger."

The sound that erupted from the stage monitors was huge, a living thing. The tight, powerful harmony of Ben’s guitar, Dave’s mandolin, and Clara’s steady rhythm filled the space, a solid wall of sound that pushed back against her nerves. Sarah’s voice soared over the top, clear and strong, and the audience, which had been a restless sea, stilled into listening. Clara focused on her hands, on the chords, on the solid, reliable beat. G. C. D. They were her tools, her foundation. As they moved into the second verse, they dropped down into the quiet, hollowed-out arrangement they had practiced, the sound shrinking to just Sarah's near-whisper and Dave's sparse mandolin. A hush fell over the crowd, people leaning in to catch the fragile sound. Then, on Clara’s cue, they came crashing back in, the full force of the band returning with a power that felt triumphant. The crowd roared its approval. In that moment, the fear was gone, burned away by the sheer joy of creation, of building something live and loud and beautiful in the open air. They weren't just playing a song; they were controlling the dynamics of a shared experience, raising the roof and then bringing it down to a whisper, all with a few chords and a story. The set they had built was standing strong.

They moved from one song to the next, the transitions they had sanded smooth in the workshop clicking into place perfectly. The energy from the crowd was a new element, a feedback loop that infused their playing with a confidence and vitality they had never quite achieved in rehearsal. Clara even took a small, melodic solo during a blues number, her fingers moving with an unthinking grace, the simple, clean notes telling a short story of their own. She could feel the support of the band around her, a solid framework that gave her the freedom to step out onto the ledge. Then, halfway through the set, the moment came. Ben nodded to her. It was time for the second original, the song about finding the guitar.

"This next one is a new song," Clara said, her voice surprisingly steady as it echoed across the field. "It's a story about salvaging things." She began the simple, melancholy chord progression, and the workshop was there with her on stage: the dusty gloom of the attic, the lingering smells of the old house, the solemn stillness of the black case. She sang the plain, honest words, and a quiet fell over the audience, a different kind of quiet from before. It was an attentive, empathetic silence. They were listening to the story. As Sarah’s harmony joined hers in the chorus, a fragile, beautiful thing about overlooked treasures, she scanned the crowd. And then she saw him. He was standing way at the back, behind the last row of picnic blankets, partially obscured by the frame of the sound tent. But it was unmistakably him. Arthur. He was standing with his arms crossed, his face tilted towards the stage, a solitary, unmoving figure in the swirling crowd. He had come. A wave of emotion so powerful it almost buckled her knees washed through her, but she didn't falter. She held the last chord, her eyes locked on his distant, unreadable form, and channeled the feeling not into her voice, but into her hands, holding the note steady, letting it ring out across the field, a solid, resonant bridge between the stage and the man at the back.

The set continued, but for Clara, everything was now filtered through the lens of her father's presence. Every note felt heavier, more meaningful. For their final number, they played "The Carpenter." She didn't introduce it. She just let the music speak for itself. As she sang the words she had written in her workshop, the words that were her life and his, she felt a profound sense of peace. She wasn't singing in defiance of him anymore, nor was she singing for his approval. She was simply telling their shared story in her own language, a language he was finally, grudgingly, beginning to understand. *'A flaw is not a flaw / when it helps a story sing...'* She delivered the line not as a challenge, but as a simple statement of fact, a piece of hard-won truth.

When the final E minor chord faded, the applause was immediate and sustained, far warmer than the polite greeting they had received. People were on their feet, cheering. The four of them stood together at the front of the stage, a little breathless, a little stunned, and took a bow. The feeling was pure, uncut exhilaration, the satisfaction of a difficult job brought to a successful, resounding conclusion. As they walked off stage, buzzing with adrenaline, the stage manager gave them a thumbs-up. "That was fantastic," he said. "The crowd loved you." In the wings, Sarah threw her arms around Clara, laughing. "We did it!" she yelled over the noise of the next band setting up. "We really did it!" Clara laughed with her, a laugh of pure relief and joy. Her gaze drifted back towards the field, to the spot by the sound tent. It was empty. He was gone. But it didn't matter. He had been there. He had stood and listened. The bridge, she knew, was still standing. It was a solid thing. You could lean on it.### Chapter 9

The ringing in their ears lasted long after they left the stage, a high, thin harmony that followed them back to the artists’ tent. Adrenaline was a live current passing between them, sparking in their shared laughter and the way they couldn't stop moving, pacing the small tent, packing their instruments with trembling, clumsy hands. Ben was a whirlwind of triumphant energy, replaying every moment, every chord change, every roar from the crowd. Sarah, usually so serene, was practically vibrating, her face flushed with a joy so pure it was dazzling. Even quiet Dave was grinning, his eyes shining. "They were listening," he kept saying, shaking his head in quiet disbelief. "They were actually listening." Clara felt a deep, foundational satisfaction, the quiet, solid pride of a job well done. She had built something, and it had held. As they made their way back through the thinning crowds, she felt a sense of belonging to this chaotic, vibrant world she had once only observed from a distance. The empty space by the sound tent where her father had stood was just a patch of darkening grass now, but the image of his solitary figure was seared into her memory. It was an unfinished joint, a question left hanging in the air, but it no longer felt like a flaw in the construction. It was simply part of the design.

Monday morning in the workshop was a study in contrasts. The silence was absolute, broken only by the familiar hum of the fluorescent lights. The air smelled clean and solitary, a pure distillation of cedar and oil that felt like coming home after a long, loud journey. As she switched on the bandsaw to make a final shaping cut on the garden bench, its rising whine was a single, clean note against the weekend’s complex harmonies. The physical work was a relief, a grounding force. Her hands, which had felt so light and quick on the fretboard, now felt solid and capable as they guided the heavy oak through the blade. The two skillsets no longer felt at war. As she spent the afternoon sanding the bench’s long, flowing curves, the rhythmic, repetitive motion became a form of meditation. She was smoothing wood, but she was also processing the weekend, finding the grain of what had happened. The workshop wasn't a retreat from her new life; it was its foundation. The songs were built here, from the dust and the light and the quiet truths of the wood. It was all one continuous act of creation.

The Amber Resin Band reconvened that Thursday in a workshop that now felt like their undisputed home base. The energy was different. The casual, relaxed vibe of their earlier jams had been replaced by a low, simmering current of purpose. Ben stood before the plywood setlist like a general before a battle map. "Forty-five minutes," he said, tapping the chalked-out list. "And it worked. It actually worked." He turned to face them, his expression serious. "So, I have to ask. What are we? Are we a bunch of mates having a jam on a Thursday, or are we… a band? A real one?" The question, direct and unadorned, hung in the sawdust-scented air. Dave stopped tuning his mandolin. Sarah looked from Ben to Clara. The weight of the question seemed to settle on her. She had been the catalyst, the accidental founder. Her songs were the central posts of the structure they had built. She looked at the faces of her friends, at the hope and the gentle pressure in their eyes, and she felt the familiar pull between the safety of what was and the terrifying possibility of what could be. "I don't know," she said honestly. "But I think we should find out."

The phone call came two days later, on a Saturday while she was cleaning her router bits. Seeing her father’s name on the screen made her stomach perform a slow, nervous flip. She answered, her voice carefully neutral. "Dad?" "Clara," he grunted. "That oil you use, the Danish one. Where do you get it from?" It was a flimsy pretext; he’d been buying the same brand for thirty years. She gave him the name of the supplier, and then a silence stretched between them, thick with everything unsaid. She was about to end the call when he spoke again, his voice gruff. "That was a big crowd, last week." He didn't say 'the festival' or 'your show'. Just 'last week'. "Yes," she said, her heart starting to beat a little faster. "It was." Another pause. "Looked like a lot of gear. Complicated. Must be a nightmare to set up." It was classic Arthur. He couldn't comment on the music, the art, the feeling. But he could see the work. He could see the practical challenge, the engineering of it. It was his way of walking across the bridge she had built, of inspecting the joinery and finding it sound. "It is," she said, a small smile finally breaking through. "But we manage."

The email arrived on Monday morning. It was from Ben, forwarded to the group with a subject line that was just a string of exclamation points. The original message was from a woman named Eleanor Vance. The name beneath her signature, ‘Hearthstone Records’, made Clara’s breath catch in her throat. Hearthstone was a small but fiercely respected independent label known for its roster of authentic, unvarnished folk and roots artists. They were known for the quality of their recordings, warm and intimate, like you were in the room with the musicians. "I was at the festival on Saturday," the email began. "And I was deeply impressed by the set from The Amber Resin Band. In a sea of polished acts, yours had a structural integrity that was impossible to ignore. It sounded… real." Clara read the words ‘structural integrity’ and felt a jolt of recognition. This woman spoke her language. The email went on to propose a meeting, to discuss the possibility of recording a five-song EP in their studio.

Clara stood in the quiet centre of her workshop, the phone glowing in her hand, the smell of woodshavings sharp in her nostrils. She looked from the glowing screen to the commission book on her desk, its pages filled with jobs, deadlines, commitments—a litany of solid, tangible, paying work. She looked at the garden bench, now finished, waiting for its final coat of oil, a beautiful, solid object she had built with her own two hands. An EP. A studio. It sounded like a dream spoken in a foreign language. It meant time she didn’t have. It meant focus pulled from the work that paid her mortgage. It meant stepping out of the comfortable, dusty world she controlled and into a world of contracts, producers, and expectations. This was not a hobby anymore. This was a choice. It was a choice between two different ways of building a life, and for the first time, she wasn’t sure which one was made of stronger timber. The quiet hum of the workshop surrounded her, a steady, familiar drone, but now, underneath it, she could hear a new sound: a faint, persistent melody, a question waiting for an answer.The ringing in their ears lasted long after they left the stage, a high, thin harmony that followed them back to the artists’ tent.

The quiet hum of the workshop surrounded her, a steady, familiar drone, but now, underneath it, she could hear a new sound: a faint, persistent melody, a question waiting for an answer.### Chapter 10

The weight of the decision settled into the rhythm of the following days. Every rasp of a hand plane, every scream of the table saw seemed to ask the same silent question. The commission book on her desk felt heavier, its neat columns of jobs and deadlines a tangible representation of the life she had so carefully built, a life of calculable hours and reliable income. The email from Hearthstone Records was a different kind of blueprint, one with vague dimensions and no clear bill of materials. It was a plan for a structure built of air and time and hope, and she didn't know how to begin quoting for the job. She called a band meeting, not in the workshop, but at her flat, a more neutral ground. Over coffee at her small, self-made kitchen table, she laid the problem out in stark, practical terms.

"A five-song EP," she began, her voice calm and measured. "Eleanor wants to meet on Friday. If we do this, it means taking a serious amount of time off. For me, that means pushing back the Finney restoration and turning down the new library shelves commission that came in this morning. It means losing income, real income, for a 'maybe'." She looked at each of them in turn. Ben, whose bar job was flexible, was practically vibrating with impatience. But Sarah was a primary school teacher with a rigid schedule, and Dave worked in IT, his holidays precious and planned months in advance. This wasn't just her choice; it was a collaborative project with real-world costs for all of them. "I need to know if we're all looking at the same set of plans," she finished. Sarah and Dave exchanged a look, a silent conversation of shared logistics and anxieties. "It's a big ask," Sarah said finally, her voice thoughtful. "But Clara… a chance like this? It's the kind of thing you build your life around, not the other way around."

Hearthstone Records was not what Clara had expected. It was housed in a converted Victorian bakery down a cobbled backstreet, its unassuming brick facade giving no hint of the world within. Inside, the air was warm and smelled of hot vacuum tubes, old wood, and coffee. There was no gleaming chrome or futuristic glass. The studio was a cathedral of analogue equipment, with vast mixing desks covered in a forest of knobs and faders, and racks of vintage gear whose purpose was a mystery to her. The walls were panelled with dark, sound-absorbing wood, the joints so perfect she found herself running a hand over them. It felt less like a high-tech laboratory and more like a master craftsman's workshop, a place where things were built by hand, with patience and skill.

Eleanor Vance matched her surroundings. She was a woman in her late fifties with sharp, intelligent eyes and a no-nonsense handshake. She didn’t waste time on pleasantries, but led them straight into the main recording room, a large, high-ceilinged space with wooden floors and carefully placed Persian rugs. “This is where the sound lives,” she said, her voice possessing a quiet authority. “We try to capture what happens in a room, not what a computer can invent.” She spoke about microphones the way Clara spoke about chisels, discussing their specific characters, what kind of grain they captured, how they responded to warmth or sharp edges. She looked at their instruments, asking Ben about the wood of his old Martin, complimenting the resonance of Clara’s salvaged acoustic. “Your sound at the festival,” she said, finally getting to the point, “was built on a solid foundation. There’s an honesty to it. I’m not interested in changing that. I’m interested in capturing it. My job is to build the best possible room for your sound to live in.” The language she used was so familiar, so rooted in the principles of structure and material, that Clara felt her own professional defenses begin to dissolve. This was a world she could understand.

The offer, when it came, was modest but real. A small advance, enough to cover their time and expenses for two weeks of intensive recording. A commitment to press a short run of CDs and vinyl, and a proper push for digital distribution and radio play on folk channels. It was a solid, well-jointed proposal. There was no promise of stardom, only the promise of a professionally built product, a tangible record of their work. They sat in Eleanor’s office, the draft contract on the coffee table between them, the weight of the decision now a physical object. "Take the weekend," Eleanor said, sensing their collective hesitation. "Talk it through. A project like this only works if the foundation is sound. All four corners need to be solid."

Clara spent Saturday morning in her father's workshop. She found him at his workbench, meticulously sharpening a set of hand-plane blades on an old whetstone, the rhythmic scrape of steel on stone a familiar, comforting sound. She didn't announce herself, just picked up a worn cotton rag and began wiping the honing oil from the blades he had finished, falling into the old, easy rhythm of apprentice and master. For a long time, they worked in a comfortable, productive silence. Finally, Clara put down the rag. "I have to turn down the Henderson job," she said. It was a big commission, a full set of custom library furniture he had helped her secure. He didn't stop his work, but his hands paused for a fraction of a second. "That's a lot of money to turn down," he stated, his eyes fixed on the blade. "I know," she said. "We've been offered a recording contract. From a proper label. For an EP."

He finished the blade he was working on, tested its edge with his thumb, and set it down with a precise click. He finally turned to look at her, his face a mask of profound, weary pragmatism. "Your uncle," he began, and Clara braced herself for the cautionary tale. "When he got his first offer, from some little label in London, he sold his van to pay for the trip. He thought it was his big chance." Arthur picked up another blade, his voice distant. "The label folded a month later. He was stuck in London with no money and no way to get his tools back. That was the beginning of the end for him." He looked at her, his pale grey eyes holding hers. "He didn't have a foundation. When the music failed, he had nothing solid to stand on. All he had was songs."

He looked around his workshop, at the solid evidence of a life’s work, at the tools and the timber and the half-finished projects. "You're not him, Clara. You have this." His gesture encompassed the entire room. "This is real. It pays the bills. It doesn't fold. You have a skill no one can take from you." A familiar wave of despair began to wash over Clara. This was it, the final warning, the pull back to solid ground. But then he continued, his voice softer, more hesitant than she had ever heard it. "That man at the festival, your friend, he said you fixed his case. Good joint, was it?" The question was so unexpected it took her a moment to answer. "Yes," she said. "I put a spline in. Walnut." Arthur nodded slowly, as if confirming a complex calculation in his head. "So you’re still working. Still building." He turned back to his whetstone. "The difference between you and him," he said, his voice a low grumble, almost to himself, "is you know how to build the damn van in the first place."

It wasn't an endorsement. It wasn't a blessing. It was something far more valuable. It was an acknowledgement of her competence. It was a master craftsman assessing a risk and, in his own gruff, indirect way, deeming the foundations sound. He saw her not as his reckless brother, but as a professional with two sets of tools, capable of making a calculated decision. He was releasing her from the weight of his fear, trusting in the skills he himself had taught her. She stood there for a long moment, the scent of oil and metal filling her lungs, a feeling of quiet, momentous clarity settling over her. She knew what she had to do. "Thanks, Dad," she said softly. He just grunted, the sound now stripped of its old power, and continued his work. Clara walked out of his workshop and into the bright afternoon sunlight, her stride long and sure, her decision made. It wasn't a choice between two lives. It was a choice to build a bigger one.The following Friday, the four of them sat in Eleanor Vance’s office again, the same draft contract on the coffee table between them. This time, however, the air was not thick with indecision, but with a quiet, focused resolve. Eleanor watched them, her sharp eyes missing nothing, as Clara, acting as their unspoken spokesperson, met her gaze. “We’ve talked it through,” Clara said, her voice clear and steady. “And we’re in. All four corners are solid.” A slow, professional smile touched Eleanor’s lips. She pushed the contract and a pen across the table. One by one, they each signed their name on the last page, their signatures a mixture of neat script and hurried scrawls. When Clara added her own practical, block-lettered name, it felt as definitive as stamping her maker’s mark onto a finished piece of furniture. It was a commitment, a joint that could not be easily undone.

Clara spent the next morning at her workbench, not with a tool in her hand, but with the phone. It felt heavier and more alien than any mallet. She took a deep breath and made the first call, her voice professional and apologetic as she explained an unforeseen delay to the client who had commissioned the library shelves. The reaction was one of grudging acceptance. The call to Mr. Henderson was harder. She could hear the distinct disappointment in his voice as she explained she would have to postpone the start date for his new furniture by at least a month. "I see," he said, the two words carrying a weight of disapproval that reminded her so acutely of her father. "Well, Clara, your work is worth waiting for. I trust you know what you’re doing." The trust, offered so freely, was both a release and a burden. As she hung up, she felt a strange mix of guilt and giddy, terrifying freedom. For the first time in her adult life, the neat, predictable grid of her schedule was a blank slate. The carefully constructed framework of her business had been partially dismantled to make room for something new, and the empty space was both exhilarating and frightening.

The workshop, now cleared of its pressing obligations, transformed into a full-time creative space. The plywood setlist was propped against a stack of timber, a constant, demanding presence. The two original songs were solid anchor points, but they needed three more load-bearing walls to complete the structure of the EP. The pressure was immense. Their jam sessions were no longer loose and exploratory; they were focused, sometimes tense, as they chased down melodies and wrestled with arrangements. They spent one entire evening trying to build a song around a bluesy riff Ben had, but it refused to stand up, collapsing under the weight of clichéd lyrics and a predictable structure. The frustration in the room was palpable, the air crackling with the same creative friction that comes from a blade that won’t hold an edge. “It feels fake,” Sarah said finally, putting her head in her hands. “It’s not our story.” She was right. They were trying to build with imported timber, and it didn't fit.

Clara found the grain for the third song late one night, long after the others had gone home. She was sitting on her workbench, running a hand over the smooth, familiar surface of her own acoustic guitar, the one that had started it all. She thought about her father’s words, about having a foundation, about knowing how to build the van in the first place. The song wasn’t about the van; it was about the two sets of tools. It was a quiet acknowledgement of the duality she had fought for so long to reconcile. She started with a simple, alternating bassline, a two-chord pattern that felt like a steady, rocking motion. The words came not as a story, but as a list, a side-by-side inventory. *'One set of hands, two sets of scars / one from a chisel, one from these guitars.'* She wrote about the calluses of the workshop and the calluses of the fretboard, about the language of wood grain and the language of a musical phrase. It was a song about balance, about how two different crafts could be housed under the same roof, in the same pair of hands. She called it "Two Tool Chests." When she played it for the band the next day, a quiet understanding settled over the room. This was their story, too. This was the honest wood.

With three solid originals and two carefully rearranged traditional songs, their set was complete. The final weeks before the recording date were a blur of intense, focused rehearsal. They didn't just practice the songs; they inhabited them, learning every curve, every joint, every point of tension and release until the music was an extension of their collective muscle memory. They were a well-oiled machine, a team of craftspeople who knew their materials and trusted each other’s skills implicitly. The day they were scheduled to start at Hearthstone, Clara packed her guitar case with a sense of solemn purpose. She took a final look around the workshop, at the sawdust on the floor and the faint outline of the plywood setlist that was now ingrained in the dust on the wall. The room had been an attic, a workshop, a sanctuary, a rehearsal space, an incubator. Now, it was time to see what they had built in it.

They walked into Hearthstone Records not as visitors, but as the job to be done. The air was warm and smelled of coffee, and Eleanor was waiting for them with a sound engineer named Marcus, a quiet man with a calming presence. They entered the main recording room, the one Eleanor called the 'living space', and began to set up, the familiar ritual a balm on their frayed nerves. Marcus moved around them, placing microphones with the precision of a surgeon, consulting with Eleanor in low tones. There was no audience, no applause, just the quiet, professional hum of a workplace. Clara looked at her bandmates, their faces pale and focused in the warm studio light. This was it. The culmination of a journey that had started with a dusty guitar case in a forgotten attic. "Alright, Amber Resin," Eleanor's voice came through their headphones, warm and clear. "Let's start with a level check. We'll begin with 'The Carpenter'. Just play it through when you're ready." Marcus gave them a thumbs-up from the control room. A small red light on a panel in front of Clara blinked on. They were recording. Ben counted them in with four soft clicks of his sticks, and from the silence, they began to build.
