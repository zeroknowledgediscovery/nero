The silence was the expensive kind. The sort bought with thick walls and a view from the clouds, a silence polished by marble and triple-glazed glass that murdered the city’s hum before it could reach the penthouse. From his perch atop the shimmering new tower on Savska Street, Luka Volarić could watch Zagreb breathe, a sprawling terracotta organism of ancient roofs and socialist-era blocks, all of it held in the green embrace of Medvednica mountain. He saw the twin spires of the cathedral, skeletal in their eternal scaffolding, and the frantic ballet of blue trams below. He saw it all, and felt an emptiness so profound it had its own gravitational pull.

He was polishing a crystal tumbler, a pointless, repetitive motion. The friction was a ghost of sensation against his palm. His reflection warped in the glass’s curve: a man of thirty, with a face that had been called handsome but now seemed merely vacant, the dark eyes holding a kind of settled weariness. His fortune was a fortress, built by his father’s relentless ambition, but the king was a prisoner. A ghost haunting the halls of his own life.

A small, gravelly voice broke the stillness. “You’ll rub a hole right through it.”

Luka’s hand stopped. He glanced down at his left hand, resting on the arm of his leather chair. A small creature made of worn green felt, with two mismatched button eyes and a tuft of red yarn for hair, was staring up at him.

“It’s clean, Kiko,” Luka murmured, his own voice a low counterpoint.

“It was clean ten minutes ago,” Kiko rasped. The puppet’s head tilted, a jerky, bird-like movement. Luka’s thumb and index finger, hidden inside, were the lifeblood, the architecture of the thing. “You’re thinking again. I can smell the smoke.”

Luka set the glass down on the polished stone of the bar. The clink was a sharp, lonely sound. He walked to the vast window, the city spread beneath him like a discarded map. He’d skied those mountains, sailed the coastlines his father’s ships now plied, dined in restaurants where the wine list cost more than a man’s yearly salary. He had consumed the world and it had left him starving.

“I’m not thinking,” Luka said. “I’m deciding.”

“Same difference. Both lead to trouble,” Kiko shot back. The puppet’s mouth, a simple slit in the felt, opened and closed with a cynical snap. “Last time you ‘decided,’ we ended up with that abstract sculpture that looks like a car crash. The artist told you it represented ‘the chaos of unregulated capital.’ You paid a million kuna for a joke at your own expense.”

“This is different.”

“Is it?” Kiko’s button eyes seemed to bore into the side of Luka’s head. “Going to buy a charity? A football club? A small island in the Adriatic where you can declare yourself king and make seagulls your cabinet ministers?”

Luka turned from the window, a faint, rare smile touching his lips. He raised his left hand, bringing Kiko level with his face. The puppet looked him over, its expression, through some alchemy of felt and intention, one of deep-seated skepticism. “I’m going to join the army.”

The puppet was still for a long moment. The silence that rushed back in was different now, charged with alarm. Then, Kiko’s little felt body convulsed in what might have been a laugh, a dry, soundless wheeze. “Brilliant. Absolutely top-tier insanity. You? In the army? They’ll use your silk shirts to clean their rifles. Your hands have never seen a callus. The softest thing you’ve ever touched is a five-hundred-euro note.”

“That’s the point,” Luka said, his voice quiet but firm. He felt a strange clarity, a sliver of light in the fog. “I want to feel something real. Dirt. Fear. Purpose. Anything other than this… this polished nothing.”

“Purpose?” Kiko scoffed, his little head shaking. “The purpose of a soldier is to get shot at so men like your father can get richer. You’re not escaping the machine, you idiot. You’re just volunteering to be one of the grimy little cogs at the bottom.”

Luka didn’t answer. He just looked at the puppet on his hand, his oldest, truest, and only friend. A friend his child psychologist had encouraged, a coping mechanism that had simply refused to be outgrown. Dr. Petrović had said he was a vessel for Luka’s repressed thoughts, his id given voice and form. But to Luka, Kiko was simply Kiko. More real, in his own way, than anyone else.

The dinner with his father was held in the family villa in Gornji Grad, a place of suffocating history. The air smelled of beeswax and old money. Portraits of stern-faced Volarić ancestors watched from the walls, their painted eyes full of judgment. Stjepan Volarić sat at the head of the long, dark-wood table, a bulldog of a man carved from granite and ambition. He didn't build an empire by tolerating nonsense.

They ate in near silence, the clatter of silverware on porcelain the only conversation. Stjepan dissected his sea bass with surgical precision, the same way he dissected a business deal. Finally, after the plates were cleared and a decanter of plum brandy was placed between them, he spoke.

“Maja tells me you’ve been distant,” he said, his voice a low rumble. It wasn’t a question. It was an accusation.

Luka took a slow breath. He hadn’t brought Kiko. His father tolerated the puppet’s existence with the same cold disdain he reserved for abstract art and weak-willed men. “I have things on my mind.”

“The company,” Stjepan stated, pouring two glasses of the brandy. “Good. It’s time you took a more active role. I’m moving you to the logistics division. You’ll oversee the Adriatic fleet. It’s time you learned the bones of this family.”

Here it was. The gilded cage, freshly polished. Another set of responsibilities he didn't want, another layer of insulation from the world. Luka looked at his father, at the hard lines around his eyes, the utter, unshakeable certainty. For the first time, he felt not intimidation, but a kind of pity.

“Father,” Luka began, his voice steady. He had rehearsed this. “I appreciate the offer. But I have other plans.”

Stjepan’s eyes narrowed slightly. He pushed a glass toward Luka. “Plans? Your plan is to marry Maja, produce an heir, and learn how not to bankrupt what I have built.”

“I’m enlisting in the army.”

The words dropped onto the table and lay there, obscene and alien. Stjepan Volarić stared at his son. His face, usually a mask of shrewd control, was momentarily blank with incomprehension. He looked as if Luka had just announced he was becoming a turnip. Then, a slow, dangerous tide of crimson crept up his neck.

“You’ll do what?” he finally managed to grate out, the words thick with disbelief.

“I’m joining the Croatian Army. I’ve already started the application process.”

Stjepan slammed his fist on the table. The brandy glasses jumped, amber liquid sloshing over the rims. “Are you insane? Have you lost your mind? An army! A Volarić! We pay for armies, we don’t serve in them! That is for farmers’ sons and boys with no future! Your future is here!” He swept his arm, indicating the house, the city, the unseen empire.

“That’s your future, Father. Your life,” Luka said, his calm infuriating the older man even more. “I need to find my own.”

“Find your own? By scrubbing toilets with a toothbrush and taking orders from some pimply lieutenant who couldn’t afford the shoes on your feet? You are spitting on everything I have worked for! On our name!”

“Our name is on a hundred cargo ships and a thousand bank statements. What does it actually mean? I want it to mean something I’ve earned.”

“You have earned nothing!” Stjepan roared, rising from his chair. He was a bull, ready to charge. “You were born with a silver spoon so far down your throat you choke on it! And now you want to trade it for a tin one? This is a phase. A rich boy’s pathetic attempt at rebellion. I forbid it.”

“I’m thirty years old. You can’t forbid me from doing anything.”

Stjepan’s face was purple. He pointed a trembling, powerful finger at Luka. “You do this, and you are no longer my son. Every account will be frozen. Every privilege revoked. You will be cut off, do you understand me? You will have nothing.”

The threat, meant to be a nuclear bomb, felt like a cool breeze. Nothing. He already had nothing. The money was the very substance of that nothingness. “I understand,” Luka said, standing up. He felt strangely light. The weight of his inheritance, a mountain he’d carried his entire life, was beginning to lift.

He walked out of the dining room, leaving his father sputtering in a cloud of rage and expensive brandy. He didn’t look back at the portraits on the wall. For the first time, he felt no obligation to their stony glares.

Back in the sterile silence of his penthouse, the city lights glittered like a field of shattered diamonds. He sank into his chair and slipped his hand into the felt puppet. Kiko’s head popped up immediately.

“So,” the gravelly voice said. “Homeless yet?”

“Almost,” Luka said. He stared at his reflection in the dark glass. A man, a puppet. A strange, lonely diptych.

“He took it well, then,” Kiko said, his tone dripping with sarcasm. “I bet his face looked like a ripe tomato. Did he offer you a brandy before or after he disowned you?”

“During,” Luka admitted.

“Classy,” Kiko rasped. “Right to the end. So what’s next on the ‘Destroy Your Life’ tour? A phone call to the Ice Queen?”

Maja. He’d been dreading it. He pulled out his phone, her picture smiling up at him—a perfect, curated smile from a charity gala last winter. He tapped the screen. She answered on the second ring, her voice a little breathless, a little annoyed.

“Luka? Finally. Your father called me. He was… screaming. I couldn’t understand half of it. Something about the army? It’s a joke, right? Some stupid, unfunny joke you’re playing on him?”

“It’s not a joke, Maja.”

There was a stunned silence on the other end of the line. He could hear her sharp intake of breath. “The army? The actual army? With guns and mud? Luka, have you been drinking? Are you on drugs?”

“I’m completely sober. And sane.”

“Sane people don’t throw their lives away!” Her voice was rising, becoming shrill. “We have a life! A wedding to plan! We were looking at venues in Istria! What am I supposed to tell people? That my fiancé has decided to go play soldier? That he’s having some kind of psychotic breakdown?”

It was always about what people would think. Her entire world was a hall of mirrors, every action judged by a thousand reflections. “Tell them the truth,” he said simply.

“The truth? The truth is that you’re being selfish and insane! You’re destroying us! Is this about me? Are you trying to get out of the wedding?”

“No,” he said, though a part of him knew it was connected. The wedding, like the logistics division, was just another block in the wall of his prison. “This is about me. For once.”

“Well, ‘you’ can have fun in your barracks with your new friends,” she spat, her voice cold and brittle now. “Don’t call me again. My father will be in touch with yours. The lawyers can sort out the detritus of this… this mess.”

The line went dead. Luka lowered the phone. Detritus. That’s what it was to her. The messy end of a business merger. He felt a pang, not of heartbreak, but of a dull, final ache. The closing of a door he should have locked himself long ago.

He was truly alone now. Him and the city lights and the puppet on his hand.

“Well,” Kiko said, his little head nudging Luka’s chin. “Two for two. You’re on a roll. You might as well go for the trifecta and call your stockbroker.”

Luka looked down at the mismatched button eyes. “This is it, then. No more safety net.”

“Never was a safety net,” Kiko said, his voice softer than usual, almost a whisper. “It was a spiderweb. And you’re the fly who finally decided to rip a wing off to get free.”

A strange sense of peace settled over Luka. The fear was still there, a cold knot in his stomach, but it was mixed with something else. A wild, terrifying excitement. He turned to his laptop, the screen illuminating his face in the dark room. He navigated to the official recruitment page for the Hrvatska kopnena vojska.

The form was long and bureaucratic. Name. Date of birth. Education. He filled it all out, his fingers moving steadily over the keys. There was a section for prior medical history. He paused, thinking of Dr. Petrović and years of therapy, of the quiet diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder that he’d always rejected, of the little felt companion on his hand. He typed ‘None.’

He reached the final page. A box to be checked. *I certify that the information provided is true and accurate. I understand the commitments and risks involved in military service.*

He hovered the cursor over the ‘Submit Application’ button. This was the precipice. Behind him, a life of luxurious emptiness. Ahead, an unknown abyss.

“No turning back,” Kiko murmured, a silent partner to the act.

Luka’s jaw tightened. He took a breath, the air tasting of freedom and ozone. He clicked the mouse. The page refreshed, displaying a simple confirmation message.

*Thank you for your interest. A recruiter will be in contact with you shortly.*

He leaned back, the leather of the chair creaking in the silent penthouse. He was adrift. Cut loose from every anchor. It was the most terrifying and most wonderful feeling in the world. He raised his left hand.

“We did it, Kiko,” he whispered to the puppet.

Kiko’s head nodded slowly, the red yarn hair flopping. “Yes, we did,” the gravelly voice replied. “God help us.”The sun rose over Zagreb, spilling liquid gold onto the terracotta roofs and glinting off the tram lines. It was the same sun that had risen yesterday, but to Luka, it felt like the dawn of a new planet. The silence in the penthouse was different now. It wasn’t a purchased commodity anymore; it was a vacuum, the sound of a life that had been deliberately and violently emptied. He had slept for a few fitful hours on the leather couch, not daring to retreat to the cavernous bedroom, and had woken up with a crick in his neck and the phantom weight of his father’s fury pressing down on him.

He made coffee with a machine that cost more than a month’s rent for an average Zagreb apartment, the hiss and gurgle sounding obscenely loud in the stillness. He took his mug and, out of habit, walked to the window. The city was waking up, a familiar rhythm he had watched a thousand times. But now he saw it with new eyes. He was no longer a spectator in the sky. Soon, he would be down there, one of the anonymous figures hurrying to a destination, a single drop in the current. The thought was both daunting and exhilarating. He pulled out his phone and opened his banking app, a knot of dread tightening in his stomach. It was just as his father had promised. His accounts, usually brimming with a dizzying string of numbers, were frozen. Access denied. A single, brutalist message in stark red letters. He was officially poor.

Kiko, who had been lying limply on the arm of the chair, stirred as Luka slipped his hand inside. “Well, look at that,” the puppet rasped, peering at the phone screen. “You’ve achieved in one night what it takes most gamblers a lifetime to accomplish. Zero. It’s a nice round number. Very minimalist.” Luka laughed, a short, sharp sound. It was true. He had nothing. The penthouse was in a family trust, the car leased through the company. The clothes on his back and the art on his walls were all that was tangibly his. And soon, even this place would be taken away. He had been given a kingdom and had managed to abdicate and exile himself in a single conversation.

Three days later, the official email arrived. It was cold and impersonal, a block of black text on a white background. It informed *Candidate Volarić, L.* of his scheduled appointment for physical and psychological evaluation at the recruitment center on Zvonimirova Street. The date was in one week. The email included a list of required documents—birth certificate, proof of citizenship, high school diploma—and a stern warning about punctuality. There was no acknowledgement of his family name, no special treatment. He was just a number now, a candidate.

The day of the appointment, Luka found himself facing his first real logistical challenge. He couldn’t take his chauffeured Mercedes; the driver had been reassigned the day after the dinner. He couldn’t call an Uber; his credit cards were blocked. He stood in his walk-in closet, a space larger than most city studio apartments, surrounded by bespoke suits and designer shirts, and realized he had no idea what a person wore to a military evaluation. He settled on a plain black t-shirt, dark jeans, and his most unassuming pair of sneakers, feeling like he was wearing a costume. In his pocket were a few thousand kuna, the proceeds from selling a vintage watch to a discreet dealer in the lower town—a transaction that had felt both illicit and profoundly liberating. It was the first money he had ever truly earned himself.

Navigating the tram system was a lesson in humility. He fumbled with the ticket machine, earning an impatient sigh from the woman behind him. He squeezed onto the crowded blue car, a sea of unfamiliar faces, of people on their way to real jobs and real lives. No one gave him a second glance. He was invisible, stripped of the aura of wealth that had always surrounded him. It was terrifying. He felt a bead of sweat trickle down his back, and the irrational fear that everyone could see he didn't belong. From the safety of his jacket pocket, he felt a slight pressure. Kiko was in there, a silent, felt contraband, and the small weight was a comfort.

The recruitment center was a drab, functionalist building from a bygone era, smelling of floor polish and institutional anxiety. It was filled with young men, most a decade younger than him, all with the same nervous energy. They were lanky and uncertain, their faces a mixture of bravado and fear. They were farmers’ sons, boys from the suburbs, kids with no other prospects. His father’s words echoed in his mind. Luka, with his soft hands and expensive haircut, stood out like a sore thumb. He could feel their curious glances, the way they took in his clothes, his watch-less wrist, the quiet confidence that was the last remnant of his old life.

“Name?” a bored-looking sergeant with a magnificent moustache barked from behind a plexiglass barrier.

“Luka Volarić.”

The sergeant’s eyes flickered up from his list for a fraction of a second, a flicker of recognition, before his face settled back into a mask of professional indifference. “Volarić. Right. Fill this out. Wait in Hall B.” He slid a stack of forms under the barrier. It was the same practiced disinterest his father used to intimidate subordinates. The difference was, the sergeant’s indifference wasn’t an act of power; it was simply a lack of giving a damn. Luka was just another piece of paper to be processed.

The day was a blur of humiliating procedures. He was weighed and measured. He gave blood and urine. In a cold, tiled room with twenty other men, he stripped down to his underwear for a medical examination by a doctor who prodded and poked him with the detached air of a mechanic checking a used car. He saw the scars and rough hands of the other men, bodies already shaped by labor. His own skin, smooth and unblemished, felt like a mark of shame. In the psychological evaluation, a captain with tired eyes asked him a series of questions from a script. “Why do you want to join the army?”

Luka had practiced his answer. “To serve my country. To find discipline and purpose.”

The captain looked at him, a long, appraising stare. “Your father is Stjepan Volarić.” It wasn't a question.

“Yes.”

“He could buy this whole base and turn it into a luxury spa if he wanted to,” the captain said, his tone flat. “Why would a man who could have anything want to sleep in a bunk bed and get yelled at for a living?”

The scripted answer felt cheap and hollow now. Luka took a breath and gave the only real one he had. “Because I have had everything, and it has felt like nothing. I want to earn something. Even if it’s just my own exhaustion.”

The captain’s expression didn’t change, but he made a small note on Luka’s file. “We’ll see,” he said, and called the next name.

Luka walked out of the center late in the afternoon, the city air thick with the promise of rain. He felt scoured out, raw. The process was designed to strip you down, to see what was left when the name and the clothes and the story were gone. Back in the penthouse, he pulled Kiko from his pocket.

“So,” the puppet’s voice rasped, muffled by the fabric. “Did they check your teeth to see if you were a thoroughbred? Ask you to sign over your inheritance to the Ministry of Defence?”

Luka placed Kiko on the bar and poured himself a glass of water, the only thing he could afford now. “They asked why I was there.”

“And what did you tell them? That you were bored of your five-star prison and wanted to sample the delights of a no-star one?” Kiko’s head swiveled to look around the vast, silent room. “You know, they’re not going to let you bring me.”

The statement hung in the air, a simple, brutal fact. Luka’s hand stilled. Of all the things he was giving up—the money, the status, Maja, his father’s approval—this was the one that lodged in his throat. Kiko couldn’t come. A soldier couldn’t have a puppet, a coping mechanism from childhood. He would be laughed out of the barracks, if not sent straight back to a psychologist. Kiko, the voice of his doubt and his courage, his only real friend, had to be left behind.

“I know,” Luka said, his voice quiet.

“So what’s the plan, genius?” Kiko demanded, his felt body stiff with something that looked like indignation. “You just going to stick me in a drawer? Leave me for the new tenants to find? Maybe they have a kid. I could be a real boy’s toy for a change, instead of a billionaire basket-case’s alter ego.”

The words were sharp, but Luka heard the fear beneath them. His fear. “I’m not leaving you,” he said, picking the puppet up, his thumb and forefinger finding their familiar home. He made Kiko look at him. “You’re the part of me that’s getting me through this. The part that told me to do it. You’re not staying in a drawer.” He looked around the opulent, empty room, his gaze falling on a small, fireproof safe hidden behind a painting. It was where his father had once told him to keep bearer bonds and sensitive documents. It was empty.

He walked over and opened it. The inside was small, dark, and secure. He gently placed Kiko inside, resting him on the velvet lining. The button eyes stared up at him.

“A box,” Kiko’s voice came, small and hollow from within the safe. “You’re putting me in a box. It’s a metaphor, isn’t it? A bit on the nose, even for you.”

“It’s the safest place I know,” Luka whispered. “When I get out—when I’m done—I’m coming back for you. This is the first thing I’ll come back for. I promise.”

He closed the heavy steel door, the click of the lock echoing in the quiet room. He had locked away his oldest friend. He had locked away a part of himself, the part he couldn't take with him. The silence that followed was absolute. He was, at last, completely and utterly alone. Outside, the first drops of rain began to streak down the vast, triple-glazed windows, washing the city clean.The official acceptance arrived not as a formal letter but as a terse, functional email a week later. *Candidate Volarić, L. has been accepted for basic military training. Report to the Petar Zrinski Barracks in Karlovac on 0800 hours, Monday.* It listed a date just two weeks away and a small inventory of what to bring—mostly toiletries and civilian clothes that would be immediately stored away. The email was so devoid of ceremony it felt anticlimactic, like an automated receipt for the purchase of a new life. Luka read it three times, the black text stark against the glowing screen of his laptop, the only light in the cavernous living room. The penthouse had already begun to feel like a tomb, a memorial to a man who was not yet dead.

The final two weeks were a strange, floating purgatory. He sold a few more items—cufflinks, another watch, a pair of Italian leather shoes he’d never worn—for cash to live on. Each transaction was a small severance, a cutting of another silken thread. He spent his days walking the city, not as its master, but as a ghost. He walked through Jelacic Square, past the cafes where he used to conduct business meetings over overpriced coffee, and felt like he was looking at a photograph of someone else’s life. He ate cheap burek from bakeries, the greasy warmth a comforting, solid presence in his hands. He was learning the city’s true currency: not kuna or euro, but the cost of a tram ticket, the price of a hot meal, the value of a dry place to sit when it rained.

On his last day, he packed a single, plain black duffel bag. Into it went the few practical clothes he’d bought, a toothbrush, soap, a razor. He walked through the penthouse one last time, his footsteps echoing on the marble floors. He passed the abstract sculpture, the monument to his own foolishness, and felt nothing. He ran a hand over the cool leather of his armchair. He paused before the painting that hid the safe. He didn’t open it. The promise was a knot in his chest. “I’ll be back,” he whispered to the hidden steel door, and the words felt like a vow made to himself. Then he walked out, leaving the keycard on the bar. He didn't close the door firmly, just let it swing shut on its hydraulic arm, the soft click a final, gentle punctuation mark at the end of a long, unread book. He walked away and didn't look back.

The bus to Karlovac was old and smelled of diesel and damp wool. Luka sat by a grimy window, watching Zagreb’s familiar skyline recede until it was just a smudge on the horizon, the cathedral spires the last thing to disappear. The other passengers were a mix of students, grandmothers, and working men, all wrapped in their own worlds. Luka was just another traveler, a man with a bag and a one-way ticket. The anonymity was a heavy cloak. Without Kiko’s gravelly commentary to fill the silence in his head, his own thoughts swirled, a chaotic mix of fear and a strange, unyielding resolve. The bus rumbled on, carrying him further from everything he had ever been.

The barracks were a sprawling complex of grim, uniform buildings behind a high fence topped with wire. The air inside the gates tasted different—colder, more disciplined. Luka and two dozen other new recruits were herded from the bus into a long, low building by a corporal who seemed perpetually annoyed. Inside, the world became a symphony of institutional green and the sharp smell of disinfectant. They were stripped of their civilian identities with brutal efficiency. Their clothes were bundled and stored, their hair shorn to a uniform, bristly length by a barber who operated his clippers with the enthusiasm of a sheep shearer. Luka watched his dark, expensively cut hair fall to the linoleum floor and felt a bizarre sense of relief. The man in the mirror was a stranger, his features stark and exposed. He was no one. He was perfect.

Their drill instructor found them in the barracks hall, a cavernous room lined with fifty steel-framed bunk beds. He was a compact, whip-cord thin man in his late forties, with a face that looked like it had been carved from walnut and left out in the sun. His name tag read ‘Sergeant Vuko’. His eyes, pale and sharp as chips of ice, swept over the line of nervous recruits, missing nothing. He moved with a predator’s economy, his boots making no sound on the polished floor.

“Welcome to the Croatian Army,” Sergeant Vuko said, his voice a low, rough growl that carried to the far end of the hall without any effort. “For the next twelve weeks, this is your home. I am your mother, your father, your priest, and your devil. Your old lives are over. Your girlfriends have forgotten you. Your mothers are crying, but I do not care. You are not boys anymore. You are not individuals. You are a single, pathetic organism, and I am going to break you down and rebuild you into something useful. Into soldiers.”

His eyes landed on Luka. They lingered for a beat too long. Vuko didn’t know his name yet, but he saw something. He saw the smooth hands, the posture that was straight but not rigid, the faint outline of a life lived in comfort. He walked slowly down the line until he stood directly in front of Luka. He didn’t shout. He spoke in that same low, dangerous voice.

“Look at this one,” he said to the room at large. “Pretty boy. Did you get lost on your way to the yacht club?”

A few nervous titters rippled through the recruits. Luka’s face burned, but he kept his eyes fixed on a point on the far wall, just as they had been instructed.

“What’s your name, pretty boy?” Vuko demanded.

“Volarić, sir.” Luka’s voice was steady, but he could feel his heart hammering against his ribs.

Vuko’s eyebrow twitched almost imperceptibly. The name registered. Of course it did. “Volarić,” he repeated, tasting the name. “A big name. Too big for this room. We don’t have big names here. We have numbers. And right now, Number Volarić, your bed is a disgrace.”

Luka glanced at the bunk he had been assigned. He had neatly placed the folded sheets and blanket on the thin mattress, just as he’d found it. Vuko followed his gaze and let out a short, contemptuous laugh. In one swift, violent motion, he grabbed the bedding and ripped it from the bunk, throwing it into a heap on the floor.

“This is not a hotel in Opatija,” Vuko snarled. “You will learn to make a bed. You will make it so tight a coin will bounce off it. You will make it so perfect an angel would weep to disturb it. And you will learn it now.” He turned to the rest of the recruits. “All of you! Watch! This is your first lesson. The lesson of details. The lesson of perfection. If you cannot master a blanket, you will never master a rifle. If you cannot conquer a corner, you will never conquer an enemy. Volarić! Fix it!”

For the next hour, under the unwavering gaze of Sergeant Vuko and the bewildered eyes of his new platoon, Luka struggled with the simple act of making a bed. Every attempt was met with Vuko’s cold scorn. He was clumsy, his fingers unaccustomed to the crisp, rough fabric. The hospital corners he attempted were sloppy, the blanket stubbornly wrinkled. Vuko tore it apart three, four, five times, his criticism a low, constant whip. “Your hands are useless, Volarić. What have they ever done? Sign checks? Hold a wine glass? They are ornamental.”

Sweat dripped from Luka’s brow, stinging his eyes. His back ached. His fingers were raw. The humiliation was a physical thing, a thick, suffocating heat. He wasn’t a king anymore. He wasn’t even a man. He was a fumbling idiot who couldn’t fold a sheet. In the back of his mind, a familiar, gravelly voice cackled. *Brilliant. Absolutely top-tier insanity. They’ll use your silk shirts to clean their rifles.* The thought was so vivid he almost flinched. But the voice wasn’t coming from his hand. It was just an echo in the empty space Kiko had left behind. He gritted his teeth, focused on the corner of the mattress, and tried again.

That night, lying in the dark on his lumpy, barely-passable bed, Luka felt an exhaustion so profound it was almost spiritual. His body was a collection of new aches. The barracks were filled with the unfamiliar symphony of forty-nine other men breathing, sighing, and snoring in their sleep. It was the opposite of the polished silence he had bought for so much money, yet it was more deeply peaceful. He was surrounded by humanity, by the simple, shared state of being tired. He had wanted to feel something real. Dirt, fear, purpose. Today, he had felt humiliation and the burn of strained muscles. It wasn’t purpose, not yet. But it was undeniably, painfully real. He flexed his left hand in the darkness, the skin empty and strange. For the first time in his life, he was on his own. The thought was no longer terrifying. It was just a fact, as solid and unforgiving as the steel frame of the bunk beneath him.The days bled into one another, each dawn a brutal assault of screeching whistles and shouted orders before the sun had even touched the horizon. Life for Luka contracted to a series of simple, agonizing tasks: the pre-dawn run in the cold Karlovac air that left his lungs burning and his legs feeling like lead; the endless push-ups and sit-ups on the gritty asphalt of the parade ground; the meticulous cleaning of a rifle he had not yet been allowed to fire. Every muscle in his body screamed in protest. He had never known this kind of pain, a deep, cellular exhaustion that sleep could only dull, never erase. The soft life had left his body a pristine but useless vessel, and the army was intent on breaking it open.

Sergeant Vuko was the architect of this deconstruction, and he had chosen Luka as his personal project. Vuko’s presence was a constant, oppressive weight. During drills, it was Luka’s posture he would correct with a sharp poke to the spine. During inspections, it was Luka’s bunk he would dissect with surgical cruelty, finding an infinitesimal speck of dust on the bed frame and ordering him to clean the entire barracks floor with a toothbrush. The sergeant’s insults were relentless and precise, aimed at the core of Luka’s former identity. "Volarić, you run like you're afraid to scuff your imaginary Italian shoes!" he would bark. "Is this how you held your champagne glass? No wonder you want to hold a rifle, it requires less delicacy!" The other recruits learned quickly to keep their distance, not wanting to be caught in the blast radius of Vuko's focused rage. Luka became an island, his isolation as palpable as the ache in his shoulders.

The true crucible came during the second week, on the obstacle course. It was a monster of mud, timber, and rope, designed to test every limit of a man’s strength and nerve. Luka, standing in line, watched the recruits ahead of him attack it with a kind of grim, practiced physicality he couldn’t comprehend. Their bodies were lean and hard, accustomed to labor. Then it was his turn. The first few obstacles were manageable—a low crawl under barbed wire that tore at his uniform, a series of hurdles he cleared with clumsy, jarring leaps. But his reserves of energy, so shallow to begin with, were draining at an alarming rate. His lungs burned, his limbs felt disconnected from his will.

Then he reached the Wall. It was a sheer wooden face, three meters high, slick with morning dew. The other recruits had scrambled over it with a burst of kinetic energy, finding foot- and hand-holds Luka couldn't see. He took a running start, his boots slipping in the mud, and jumped. His fingers scraped against the rough wood, failing to find a purchase. He fell back, landing hard on his rear, the impact jarring up his spine. A wave of laughter, quickly suppressed, rippled from the recruits waiting behind him. Vuko, who had been observing from a platform, walked over, his expression one of pure, theatrical disappointment.

“What’s the matter, Volarić?” Vuko’s voice was dangerously soft. “Is there not a valet to give you a boost? Should we install a small elevator for you?” He gestured at the wall. “This is not a suggestion. This is an order. Get over it.” Luka scrambled to his feet, his face hot with shame. He tried again, and again, his hands becoming raw, splinters embedding themselves in his palms. His arms, conditioned by nothing more strenuous than polishing a crystal tumbler, trembled and gave out. He was a fish trying to climb a tree, a pathetic, hopeless spectacle. He could feel the frustration of the men behind him, their training held up by his incompetence. He was the weak link. He was the anchor dragging them all down.

Finally, after another failed attempt left him gasping for air at the base of the wall, Vuko stepped forward. “Enough,” he snapped. He turned to the two recruits behind Luka. “Perić, Horvat! Get this baggage over the wall. The rest of you have a schedule to keep.” Two sturdy, sun-browned boys grabbed Luka, one boosting him from below while the other leaned over the top, grabbing his arm and hauling him up like a sack of grain. He tumbled ungracefully onto the muddy ground on the other side, his body a dead weight. He lay there for a moment, the smell of damp earth filling his nostrils, the shame so total it was almost a physical nausea. He had failed utterly and publicly. He had needed to be carried. The boys who had helped him ran past without a word, their faces blank, not wanting to be associated with his failure.

That evening, the atmosphere in the barracks was thick with a new kind of silence. Luka’s failure was a shared experience, a story they would all tell. He sat on the edge of his bunk, trying to pull a splinter from his palm with a pair of tweezers, his hands shaking with exhaustion. He felt the phantom presence of Kiko more strongly than ever, imagining the puppet's gravelly voice. *Well, that was graceful. Looked like a sack of expensive potatoes falling off a truck. Told you this was a bad idea.* But the voice offered no comfort, only a hollow echo of his own self-loathing. The urge to quit was a physical ache in his chest. He could walk away right now. He could call one of his father’s lawyers, be back in his penthouse by morning. The thought of the polished silence, the view, the sheer effortlessness of it all, was a siren song.

As he was struggling with a particularly deep splinter, a shadow fell over him. He looked up to see one of the recruits, a quiet, lanky boy from a village near Osijek named Marko, the one Vuko called 'Farmer'. Marko had been one of the first over the wall, scaling it with the easy grace of someone who'd grown up climbing trees. He didn't say anything, just held out a small, calloused hand. In his palm was a tube of antiseptic cream and a cleaner, sharper pair of tweezers.

“You have to get at it from the side,” Marko said, his voice a low, rural rumble. “If you push straight down, you just drive it deeper.” He gestured at Luka’s hand. “Here.” Luka hesitated, then numbly held out his hand. Marko worked with a surprising gentleness, his rough fingers steady and precise. He extracted the splinter with a quick, clean motion that made Luka hiss in pain. “There,” Marko said, dabbing a bit of the cream on the small wound. He looked at Luka’s other palm, a raw, blistered mess. “You should wash those with cold water. Your hands are not used to it. They will get harder.”

It wasn't an offer of friendship. It was a simple, practical statement of fact, delivered without judgment or pity. It was the first act of unsolicited kindness Luka had received since he had arrived. Marko straightened up, gave a short, almost imperceptible nod, and walked back to his own bunk, the transaction complete. Luka stared at the small, red mark on his palm where the splinter had been. It was a tiny wound, but it felt like an opening. He was still an outcast, still a failure. But for a brief moment, someone had looked at him not as ‘Volarić the rich boy’, but as a fellow recruit with a splinter in his hand.

Later, lying in the dark, every fiber of his being aching, Luka stared up at the bottom of the bunk above him. The siren song of his old life was fainter now, drowned out by the throb in his palms and the memory of Marko’s quiet gesture. He thought of the wall, of the feeling of his fingers failing to grip, of the utter helplessness. That was real. The sting of the antiseptic cream was real. The collective snoring of forty-nine exhausted men was real. He flexed his left hand. It was empty, but it felt heavier than it had before, filled with the new weight of failure and the ghost of a connection. He had wanted to earn something. He hadn't earned respect yet, or a place in the platoon. But as he looked at his raw, dirty hands in the faint moonlight slanting through the barracks window, he realized he had earned this pain. It was his. And for the first time, it felt like a beginning.The change did not begin with a grand revelation or a sudden surge of strength. It began in the cold, dark hour before dawn, with the quietest act of rebellion Luka had ever committed. He woke before the whistle, his body a symphony of aches, and instead of dreading the inevitable pain, he swung his legs over the side of the bunk. In the near-total darkness of the barracks, surrounded by the deep, rhythmic breathing of sleeping men, he dropped to the floor. His first push-up was a shaky, pathetic effort, his arms trembling under his own weight. He managed five before collapsing, his cheek pressed against the cold, dusty linoleum. He lay there, gasping, sweat already beading on his brow. It was a pathetic display, yet it was his. He had not been ordered. He was not performing for Vuko’s scornful gaze. It was a private war waged against his own weakness, and it was the first battle he felt he might not lose.

When the whistle shrieked and the lights flickered on, Luka was already on his feet, his heart thumping a steady, ready rhythm. During the morning run, he didn’t try to keep up with the tireless farm boys at the front. Instead, he found Marko’s back in the pre-dawn gloom and fixed his eyes on it. He focused on the steady cadence of Marko’s feet, the rhythm of his breathing, and forced his own body to match it. He was no longer just running from pain; he was running toward a benchmark. He finished the run in the middle of the pack, his lungs on fire, but he did not stumble, and he did not finish last. As they lined up, gasping in the chilled air, he saw Sergeant Vuko’s gaze pass over him. There was no insult, no theatrical sneer. There was only a brief, almost imperceptible narrowing of the eyes before Vuko moved on, a silent acknowledgement that something had shifted.

The obstacle course loomed again at the end of the week, a recurring nightmare rendered in mud and timber. As Luka stood in line, his stomach twisted with the memory of his failure. He could still feel the phantom weight of the other recruits’ hands hauling him over the wall, the sting of their silent judgment. But as he watched them this time, he wasn't just seeing their strength; he was studying their technique. He saw how Perić used a small knot in the wood as a foothold, how Horvat swung his leg over the top in a single fluid motion. He was no longer a spectator at his own life; he was a student of survival. When his turn came, Vuko was already watching, a faint, predatory smirk on his face, waiting for the encore of incompetence.

Luka ran at the Wall. He jumped, his raw fingers finding the knot Perić had used. His boot found a hold. He pulled, his underdeveloped muscles screaming in protest. He got halfway up before his grip failed and he slid back down, the rough wood scraping his forearms. "Having trouble with your vertical ascent, Volarić?" Vuko called out, the comment lacking its usual fire, as if it were a mandatory recitation. Luka ignored him. He took a deep, ragged breath, the smell of mud and his own sweat filling his senses. He tried again. This time, he remembered Horvat’s leg swing. He hauled himself up, his arms shaking violently, and threw a leg over the top. For a heart-stopping second, he was precariously balanced, half on, half off. Then, with a final, guttural roar that was torn from the very depths of him, he heaved the rest of his body over, tumbling onto the other side. He lay there, gasping, his heart a wild drum against the earth. He had done it. It was the ugliest, most graceless victory of his life, and it was the most beautiful thing he had ever achieved. He pushed himself to his feet and ran toward the next obstacle without looking back.

The rifle range was a different kind of test. Here, strength was secondary to stillness, aggression to patience. Sergeant Vuko became a different man. His voice, though still rough, lost its taunting edge and took on the focused intensity of a master craftsman. He taught them as if he were teaching a religion: the gospel of breath control, the creed of sight alignment, the sacred geometry of stance. When Luka held the rifle for the first time, its cold, dense weight felt more significant than any object he had ever held. It was a thing of pure function, devoid of aesthetics or status. It was a tool, and Vuko was teaching him to be its master.

He lay prone on the dusty mat, the rifle butt pressed firmly into his shoulder, and tried to quiet the noise in his head. For years, his mind had been a frantic, untamed thing, ricocheting between boredom and a vague, persistent anxiety. But now, he had a single point of focus: the distant paper target, shimmering in the heat haze. He remembered the long, empty afternoons in the penthouse, watching the trams below, forcing a stillness upon himself because there was nothing else to do. He channeled that emptiness now, letting his breath slow, feeling the space between his own heartbeats. He aligned the sights, exhaled slowly, and in the quiet hollow at the end of his breath, he squeezed the trigger. The rifle kicked against his shoulder, a clean, sharp shock. The smell of cordite was acrid and thrilling. Through the spotting scope, he saw a neat, round hole. Not a bullseye, but on the paper, and close. He fired again, and again, focusing on replicating the exact same process, the same stillness. His five shots formed a tight, deliberate cluster, just low and to the left of the center.

Vuko walked the line, his boots crunching on spent casings. He glanced at the targets of the recruits on either side of Luka with dismissive grunts. Then he stopped, his shadow falling over Luka. He stared at Luka’s target for a long moment. Luka braced himself for the inevitable insult. But it didn't come. “You’re anticipating the recoil,” Vuko said, his voice a low growl right next to Luka’s ear. “Stop thinking about the kick. It’s already happened. And breathe out slower. You’re pulling to the left on the last of your air.” He tapped the stock of Luka’s rifle with his finger. “Again.” And then he walked on. The words were a criticism, but Luka felt a warmth spread through his chest. It was the first piece of genuine instruction Vuko had ever given him. He was no longer a joke to be broken. He was a soldier to be corrected.

That night, the barracks felt different. The air of collective animosity toward him had evaporated, replaced by a neutral, almost unnoticeable acceptance. While cleaning his rifle, his hands now moving with a nascent, fumbling confidence, Marko approached him. "Vuko said you have a good eye," he said, not looking at Luka but at the rifle parts laid out on the bunk. It was a monumental statement. Luka just nodded, unsure what to say. "He said you think too much," Marko added, and walked away. Later, another recruit, Horvat, asked him a quiet question about disassembling the bolt. Luka answered, and the conversation ended. These were not overtures of friendship. They were the first, tentative connections of a functioning organism, the meshing of small cogs. He was no longer a foreign body to be rejected. He was becoming part of the machine. As he finally lay down in the dark, his hands smelling of oil and solvent, he flexed his left hand. The phantom itch of Kiko's felt was still there, a ghost in his muscle memory. But for the first time, the silence in his head was not an emptiness to be filled, but a quiet space of his own making. It was the satisfying peace of a man who had earned his exhaustion, and who knew, with bone-deep certainty, that he would do it all again tomorrow.The weeks that followed were a testament to the body’s brutal, miraculous ability to adapt. The agony of Luka’s muscles subsided into a permanent, low-level ache, a constant reminder of the work they had done and the work that was yet to come. His hands, once the objects of Vuko’s scorn, transformed. The blisters broke, healed, and were replaced by thick, yellowed calluses that felt like armor. He watched them one morning while cleaning his rifle, turning them over in the pale light. They were ugly, functional, and undeniably his. He had earned every rough patch, every scar. He looked at his reflection in the polished bolt of his rifle and saw a stranger staring back. The last vestiges of softness had been stripped from his face, leaving behind harder lines, a leaner jaw, and eyes that were perpetually narrowed in focus. The haunted emptiness was gone, replaced by a quiet, watchful intensity.

The routine of the barracks became a liturgy. The shriek of the whistle, the cold shock of the morning air, the rhythmic pounding of boots on asphalt, the communal, almost silent exhaustion in the evenings—these were the new pillars of his existence. He learned the unspoken language of the platoon, a language of shared glances, quiet assistance, and mutual suffering. He learned that Marko, the farmer’s son, could predict the weather by the ache in his left knee, and that Horvat, the boy from Split, could fall asleep standing up if left unsupervised for more than a minute. They, in turn, learned that Luka had an uncanny memory for maps and a preternatural calm on the shooting range. He was no longer Volarić, the curiosity. He was just Volarić, the man who was good with a compass and could hold his breath longer than anyone else.

Their world expanded beyond the barracks walls. They were driven in rumbling trucks into the dense, ancient forests of Gorski Kotar for field exercises. Here, the enemy was not just fatigue, but the terrain itself. The cold seeped into their bones, the rain was a constant, miserable companion, and the forest at night was a disorienting labyrinth of black trees and unseen things that rustled in the undergrowth. They learned to dig foxholes in the hard, rocky soil, to subsist on cold rations that all tasted vaguely of plastic, and to trust the man next to them with their lives, not out of affection, but out of necessity. It was during one of these exercises, huddled under a leaking poncho while trying to shield a map from the relentless drizzle, that a mail bag arrived.

Among the flimsy, eagerly-awaited letters from home was a stiff, cream-coloured envelope addressed to him. The paper was thick, expensive, and absurdly out of place in the mud and damp. His name and service number were typed in a severe, impersonal font. He knew before he opened it. It was from his father's world. Inside, there was no letter, no handwritten note. It was a multi-page legal document, dense with jargon and clauses, from the law firm that had handled the Volarić family’s affairs for three generations. It formally detailed the dissolution of his trust, the transfer of his shares back to the parent company, and the legal finality of his disinheritance. It was a cold, precise amputation. Attached to the last page with a simple paperclip was a newspaper clipping. It was a short article from a business journal, announcing his father’s new philanthropic initiative—a massive donation to the Zagreb cathedral’s eternal restoration. The headline read: “Stjepan Volarić Invests in Croatia’s Heritage.” The subtext was clear: My son has forsaken his legacy, so I will adopt the nation’s instead.

Luka read it all with a strange detachment. He felt a flicker of something—not sadness, but the faint, ghost-pain of a long-removed limb. This document was the death certificate for the man he used to be. The man who had everything and was starving. He looked at the thick, luxurious paper in his hands, then at the small, sputtering fire his squad was trying to coax into life with damp twigs. Without a second thought, he carefully tore the first page of the legal document into strips, crumpled them into a tight ball, and tucked them under the wet kindling. The expensive paper, designed to document the transfer of millions, caught fire with a satisfying, almost eager whoosh. It burned hot and bright for a few precious seconds, long enough for the twigs to catch. Horvat, hunched over the nascent flame, looked up at him, his face streaked with mud and lit by the fire. “Good paper,” he grunted, before turning back to blow gently on the embers. Luka fed the rest of the document to the fire, page by page, watching the legal clauses and financial figures turn to black, curling ash.

The culmination of their basic training was a seventy-two-hour continuous field exercise, a final, brutal examination of everything they had learned. The platoon was divided, playing the role of both hunter and hunted in a vast, forested valley. Sergeant Vuko was a malevolent god, appearing at the worst possible moments to declare a man notionally “dead” for a lapse in security, or to change their objectives with a curt radio command. On the final night, a storm rolled in, turning the forest into a primal chaos of wind, rain, and impenetrable darkness. Luka’s squad, led by a young lieutenant but functionally operating under Vuko’s watchful eye from a remote command post, was given a critical task: a night navigation through unfamiliar, treacherous terrain to establish a new observation post by dawn.

Their GPS was declared “jammed”—a classic Vukoism. They were down to a map, a compass, and their wits. The lieutenant, barely older than Luka’s former self and flustered by the conditions, was struggling to get a bearing. Rain plastered their hair to their heads and trickled down their backs. Tempers were fraying. Marko, a powerhouse in daylight, was unnerved by the disorienting dark. Luka, holding the compass, felt a strange sense of clarity amidst the chaos. The wind howling through the pines was no different from the polished silence of his penthouse; it was just a sound. The rain was just water. He closed his eyes for a moment, not to despair, but to listen, to feel the slope of the land under his feet. He remembered the stillness he had learned on the range. He opened his eyes, shielding the map from the rain. "Sir," he said to the lieutenant, his voice calm and steady. "The stream should be two hundred meters to our left. If we follow it north, it will lead us to the base of this ridge. It’s a longer route, but it's less exposed than the hilltop." The lieutenant, relieved to have a concrete suggestion, agreed immediately.

Luka took point, his world shrinking to the faint, ethereal glow of his compass and the feel of the land. He moved with a new confidence, not of arrogance, but of competence. He was a cog in the machine, and he knew his function. He found the stream, and the squad moved with a renewed, quiet purpose, a line of ghosts in the storm. They reached the designated coordinates with less than an hour to spare before dawn, setting up their post in the exhausted, synchronized silence of a team that had finally fused. As the first grey light began to filter through the trees, a voice crackled over the lieutenant's radio. It was Vuko. "Blue-3, report status." "Command, Blue-3 is in position. Objective secure," the lieutenant replied, his voice thick with fatigue and pride. There was a long pause on the other end, filled only with static. Luka, Marko, and the others held their breath. Then Vuko's growl came back. "Acceptable. Don't get comfortable." The line went dead.

As they marched back to the extraction point hours later, filthy, hollow-eyed, and smelling of mud and sweat, they passed another squad being berated by a furious Vuko. As Luka’s squad trudged past, Vuko’s tirade paused. His icy gaze swept over them, lingering for a moment on the lieutenant, then on Marko, and finally, it settled on Luka. For a full three seconds, their eyes met across the muddy track. Vuko’s expression was as hard and unreadable as ever. But then, in a gesture so small it was almost imperceptible, he gave a single, sharp nod. It was a gesture of pure, unadulterated acknowledgement. Then he turned back to the unfortunate squad and resumed his verbal assault. Luka felt the nod land on him with the weight of a physical blow. It was more valuable than any million-kuna bonus, more meaningful than any word of praise he had ever received in his life. He looked at the mud on his boots, felt the comforting, solid weight of the rifle on his shoulder, and for the first time since he had clicked that ‘Submit Application’ button in a silent penthouse overlooking a city of lights, he knew, without a single shred of doubt, that he was exactly where he was supposed to be.The graduation ceremony was held on a crisp, sun-drenched morning that felt like a benediction. The fifty men who had shuffled into the barracks twelve weeks ago as a collection of nervous boys and one bewildered billionaire now stood on the parade ground as a single, sharp-edged unit. Their movements were precise, their mismatched civilian bodies honed into a startling uniformity. Dressed in crisp service uniforms, they were almost unrecognizable. Luka stood at attention, his gaze fixed forward, feeling the unfamiliar weight of the polished boots on his feet and the collective, rhythmic breathing of the men around him. This square of asphalt, once a theater of his humiliation, now felt like hallowed ground, every crack and stain a testament to the sweat and effort they had left there.

After the formal drills and the address from a visiting general whose speech was a predictable tapestry of duty, honour, and country, came the moment they had all bled for. One by one, their names were called. They marched forward, saluted, and were presented with the green beret of the Croatian Army. When Luka’s name was called, "Private Volarić," it sounded no different from any other. He moved with the drilled precision that had been hammered into him, his salute sharp, his back ramrod straight. The officer handing him the beret, a stern-faced colonel, met his eyes for a fraction of a second, his expression unreadable. Luka took the beret, the felt rough and substantial in his hand. As he put it on, the fit snug against his shorn head, he felt a profound, almost physical shift. It was not a crown, but it was the first thing he had ever truly worn that he felt he had earned.

The ceremony concluded, and the formation dissolved into a controlled chaos of back-slapping and stiff, unpracticed handshakes. As the men began to drift away to collect their belongings and their travel orders, Luka saw Sergeant Vuko standing near the barracks, observing the dispersal with his arms crossed, a lone wolf watching the pack scatter. Luka hesitated for a moment, then walked toward him. He stopped a respectful distance away and stood at ease. Vuko’s icy eyes appraised him, taking in the new uniform, the beret, the solid way he now stood on the ground.

“So,” Vuko grunted, his voice the familiar gravelly rumble. “They made you a soldier after all. Or at least you look like one. The real test starts now.” Luka just nodded, saying nothing. There was nothing to say. Vuko tilted his head slightly. “Volarić. Your left eye is dominant. I’ve seen it on the range. You keep trying to force the right. You’re fighting yourself.” He took a step closer, his voice dropping lower. “Stop fighting it. Learn to shoot with both eyes open. You’ll see more of the world you’re supposed to hit. And out there,” he gestured vaguely towards the world beyond the gates, “seeing the whole picture is the only thing that will keep you alive.” He held Luka’s gaze for a second longer, then gave a curt, almost dismissive nod. “Go on. Get out of my sight.” It was the most profound blessing Luka had ever received.

The platoon, which had been his entire world, disintegrated in a matter of hours. Men he had shared every waking and sleeping moment with for three months scattered to different bases, different specializations, different lives. The goodbyes were abrupt, practical. A nod, a clap on the shoulder. They had served their purpose to one another, forging each other in a crucible, and now it was done. Luka found his orders and saw that he, along with Marko and a handful of others, were assigned to the 1st Mechanized Battalion, the ‘Tigers’, based in Petrinja. A quiet sense of relief passed between him and Marko. At least one familiar landmark would exist in the new, unknown territory.

The bus ride back to Zagreb for their 72-hour leave was the reverse of his first journey. He was no longer a candidate escaping a life, but a soldier on a short leash, heading toward a city where he had no home. The familiar landscape seemed altered, the colours more vibrant, the civilian world impossibly loud and chaotic. When he stepped off the bus at the main terminal, the frantic energy of the city was a physical assault. People rushed past, their faces consumed by concerns he no longer understood—missed appointments, social engagements, trivial anxieties. They were free, and yet they all looked trapped. He, in his rigid uniform and with his rigidly defined life, felt freer than any of them.

With the small amount of pay he had received—a pittance that would not have covered a round of drinks in his old life—he found a cheap hostel near the station. The room was a tiny, bare-walled cell with a lumpy bed and a window that looked out onto a grimy airshaft. It smelled of stale cigarettes and damp. Lying on the thin mattress, Luka felt a strange sense of contentment. The room was anonymous, functional, and it was his for the night. It was more real than the penthouse had ever been. He spent the next day walking, a ghost in his own hometown. He walked to Gornji Grad and stood across the street from the suffocating history of the family villa, watching the emotionless facade, feeling nothing but the cold indifference of a stranger. He walked down Savska Street and looked up at the shimmering tower that had been his perch. He could just make out the vast windows of the penthouse, a dark, blank eye staring out over the city.

The thought of Kiko, alone in the velvet-lined dark of the safe, was a sudden, sharp ache. He had made a promise. He had the keycard to his old apartment still tucked in the wallet he’d been issued. He could go up there. The security guards knew him; they might not know he had been cut off. He could walk in, open the safe, and retrieve the one piece of his old life that still mattered. He stood there on the pavement for a long time, the trams clattering past, the city’s hum a familiar song. He could almost feel the worn felt in his hand, hear the cynical, gravelly voice cutting through his thoughts. *What are you waiting for? An invitation? Go get me. This soldier act is all well and good, but you’re still you.* But he knew it wasn’t true. He wasn’t the same man who had put the puppet in that safe. That man had needed a voice for his fear and his doubt. This new man was learning to quiet them on his own. Going back for Kiko now would be a retreat. It would be an admission that he couldn't do this alone. The promise was not for today. The promise was for the man he would be when all of this was over. He turned away from the tower and walked back toward the noise and grime of the lower city.

His leave ended as quietly as it began. He spent his last few kuna on a hot meal of stew and bread in a small, workers’ restaurant, the taste rich and satisfying. Then he took the bus to Petrinja. Arriving at the new base was different from arriving at basic training. This was an operational barracks, home to a legendary battalion. The energy was quieter, more serious. There was no need for shouting and intimidation; the discipline was ingrained, the professionalism assumed. Luka and the other new arrivals were assigned to their companies and led to their quarters. His squad room housed eight men. He walked in, his duffel bag slung over his shoulder, and the quiet conversation in the room stopped. Four pairs of eyes looked up—veteran soldiers, their faces lean and their gazes steady, assessing the new blood with a practiced, neutral curiosity. A corporal with a thick neck and a three-day-old stubble gestured with his chin towards an empty bunk. "Volarić? You're with us. Drop your gear. You're on weapons cleaning rota. Welcome to the Tigers." Luka nodded, dropped his bag, and began to unpack, the simple, familiar rhythm of military life taking over once more. He was a long way from the penthouse, and a longer way still from being the man he was supposed to become, but as he laid his spare uniform neatly at the foot of his bunk, he knew he was finally home.The air in the squad room was thick with the smells of gun oil, worn leather, and brewing coffee. It was a lived-in, masculine scent, a world away from the sterile disinfectant of the training barracks. The four veteran soldiers of his new squad were not boys. They were men in their late twenties and early thirties, their movements economical, their silences comfortable. They had the quiet, watchful stillness of predators at rest. Luka felt their eyes on him as he methodically unpacked his duffel bag, arranging his meager possessions with the precision that had been beaten into him. He was the new part in a well-oiled machine, and he knew they were all watching to see if he would fit, or if he would grind the gears.

The man who had pointed him to his bunk was Corporal Jurić, a compact fireplug of a man whose forearms were a tapestry of faded tattoos and ropy muscle. Jurić was the squad leader, and he ruled not with Vuko’s theatrical fury, but with an unnerving, absolute competence. He said little, but when he spoke, his words were dense with authority. For the first week, Luka’s interactions with him were limited to a series of grunted commands. "Volarić, clean the breeches." "Volarić, inventory the comms batteries." "Volarić, you’re on first watch." Luka complied without question or comment, performing each menial task with a focused, almost monastic devotion. He understood this was a test, not of his skill, but of his attitude. He was being tested for the presence of the silver spoon he was born with, and he was determined to prove it had been fully digested.

Days turned into weeks, and the rhythm of life in the Tigers battalion settled into a demanding but steady cadence. The training was a quantum leap beyond basic. They drilled in urban combat in a mock village, the crack of blank rounds echoing off concrete walls, learning the deadly ballet of clearing rooms and covering corners. They spent long days on advanced firing ranges, practicing shooting from moving vehicles and in low-light conditions. Luka, a sponge for new knowledge, absorbed it all. He learned to read the subtle shifts in Jurić’s posture that signaled an impending order. He learned that the squad’s sniper, a gaunt man named Kos, rarely spoke but saw everything. He learned that Marko, buoyed by the familiar presence of his basic training comrade, was still the strongest man in the unit but had a paralyzing fear of enclosed spaces, a fact the others accommodated without comment or ridicule. Luka learned to become invisible, to anticipate needs, to be reliable. He was the first one ready for inspection, his gear always in perfect order. He did not offer opinions, but he listened to every conversation, piecing together the complex web of relationships and experiences that bound these men together.

Their first major exercise as a full platoon took them to the rolling, forested hills near the Bosnian border, a landscape scarred with the memories of a real war. The scenario was a long-range reconnaissance patrol, a test of stealth, endurance, and autonomy. The crisp autumn air had a biting edge, and the nights were freezing. For three days, they moved like ghosts through the dense woods, communicating with hand signals, sleeping in shifts in hastily dug shelters, and living on high-energy ration bars that tasted like sweetened sawdust. This was not a performance for the benefit of instructors; this was a rehearsal. The sense of reality was palpable, a low hum of tension beneath the surface of the exercise. Luka felt a strange sense of peace in the constant, low-grade discomfort. His world had contracted to the mission, to the weight of the pack on his back, and the man in front of him.

On the third day, they were tasked with observing a simulated enemy encampment in a valley below. Jurić found them a perfect observation post, a rocky outcrop concealed by a thicket of pine and gorse. They settled in for a long, cold watch, rotating positions, their field glasses scanning the quiet camp. Luka’s turn came in the late afternoon, as the sun began to dip, casting long, deceptive shadows across the valley. He lay prone, the cold of the rock seeping through his uniform, the rifle cradled in his arms. He wasn’t a sniper, but he used the rifle’s scope for detailed observation, its powerful magnification revealing the small details of the camp below. As he watched, he remembered Vuko’s final, cryptic instruction. *Stop fighting it. Learn to shoot with both eyes open. You’ll see more of the world you’re supposed to hit.*

It was a technique he had been practicing on the range, forcing his brain to process two separate images at once. It was disorienting, but Vuko was right; it dramatically expanded his peripheral vision. He relaxed, letting his dominant left eye focus through the scope on a tent in the center of the camp, while his right eye remained open, taking in the wider, unfocused panorama of the surrounding hillside. The two images overlapped, a strange, doubled reality. He lay there for a long, motionless ten minutes, his breathing slow and even. The camp was quiet, lulling. And that was when he saw it. In the unfocused periphery of his right eye, a flicker of movement. It was not a bird or a deer. It was a dark shape, low to the ground, moving with unnatural smoothness along a crease in the terrain on the far side of their position. It was a flanking team, using the long shadows as cover, moving to encircle them.

His heart didn't leap. His adrenaline didn't spike. A profound, icy calm settled over him, the same stillness he had found on the range. The men in the camp below were a diversion. The real threat was coming from behind. He didn't shout. He didn't even shift his position. He keyed his radio on the squad channel, his voice a low, even whisper. "Jurić. Two o'clock. Four hundred meters. Ridge line. Two, maybe three bogies moving to flank. Using the dry creek bed for cover." The response was immediate. Jurić, lying a few meters away, didn't even look up from his own binoculars. "Kos, confirm." The squad sniper shifted his position slightly. A few seconds of silence passed. "Confirmed," Kos whispered back, his voice like dry leaves rustling. "Three men. They haven't made us." Jurić’s voice was as calm as Luka's. "Good eyes, Volarić. All stations, prepare to displace west. On my mark." The squad began to melt away from their position with the silent, fluid efficiency of a single organism, a retreat that was not a retreat, but a repositioning to turn the hunter into the hunted. Luka was the last to leave, his eyes still scanning the valley, his right eye watching the approaching threat, his left eye watching the decoy. For the first time, he was seeing the whole picture.The success of the maneuver was not loud or glorious; it was a silent, lethal piece of clockwork. As the squad melted back into the deeper woods, circling around to come in on the flank of their flankers, Luka felt a strange sense of time compressing. Every rustle of a leaf, every snap of a twig under another man’s boot, was a note in a complex symphony he could suddenly hear perfectly. He was no longer a passenger. He was an instrument, moving in concert with the others. When they finally engaged the "enemy" squad in the dry creek bed, the ambush was so swift and decisive that the exercise umpires, who emerged from the trees like disgruntled ghosts, simply blew their whistles and declared the engagement over before it had truly begun. The mock battle was won not with a clash, but with a quiet, intellectual violence, a victory of observation over aggression.

The long march back to the extraction point was grueling, a twenty-kilometer slog under the weight of full packs. But the exhaustion was different this time, laced with a shared, unspoken satisfaction. At one point, Jurić fell into step beside Luka, his boots crunching on the gravel track in a steady, hypnotic rhythm. He didn’t offer praise or congratulations. Instead, he looked straight ahead, his eyes on the horizon, and asked a simple question, his voice a low rumble. "What did you see first? The colour, or the movement?" It was a question from one professional to another, a query about technique. "The movement," Luka replied, his own voice hoarse with fatigue. "It didn't match the wind in the trees. It was too smooth." Jurić grunted, a sound of profound analytical approval. He reached into his pouch, pulled out a small, foil-wrapped bar of dark, bitter chocolate—part of his personal stash, not standard issue—broke it in two, and handed a piece to Luka without a word. Luka took it, the simple gesture of sharing landing with more weight than any formal commendation. The bitter chocolate melted on his tongue, a taste of respect.

Back in the barracks, the invisible wall that had separated Luka from the squad’s core had evaporated. As they sat on their bunks, meticulously cleaning their rifles in a comfortable, oil-scented silence, Kos, the sniper, walked over. He squatted down in front of Luka, his movements as spare and precise as his speech. He held out a small tin. "Beeswax and turpentine," Kos said, his voice barely a whisper. "From my grandfather. Rub a thin layer on your scope lenses before a cold night. Stops the fog from forming inside." He placed the tin on Luka's bunk. "You have good eyes. Don't let them get clouded." It was more than a tip; it was an inheritance, a secret of the trade passed from one observer to another. Later that evening, in the mess hall, the small table where Jurić and the other squad leaders usually sat was joined by another. Jurić caught Luka’s eye from across the noisy room and gave a curt nod towards an empty seat. The invitation was clear. Luka picked up his tray and joined them, sliding onto the bench between a grizzled master sergeant and a quiet demolitions expert. The conversation about engine maintenance and radio frequencies flowed around and, eventually, through him. He was no longer on the outside looking in. He was simply at the table.

That night, lying in his bunk, sleep was a distant shore. The day’s events replayed in his mind not as a highlight reel, but as a series of connected sensations: the cold stone under his chest, the texture of the bitter chocolate, the smell of Kos’s waxing tin. He thought of the life he had left, a life of acquisitions. He had bought art, cars, experiences, even silence. Each purchase had delivered a fleeting hit of novelty that quickly faded into the familiar, profound emptiness. He remembered the thrill of signing the check for the ridiculous car-crash sculpture, a million-kuna monument to his own cynicism. The feeling had evaporated by the time he got home. The feeling he had now, however, was entirely different. It was a deep, resonant warmth that had settled in his bones. It was the satisfaction of usefulness. It was the quiet pride of having been a crucial, functioning part of something larger than himself. He had not acquired this feeling. He had forged it himself from mud and cold and focus. It was the first thing in his entire life that felt truly and completely his own.

A few days later, the television in the corner of the mess hall was tuned to the evening news. Most of the soldiers ignored it, their attention focused on their food and their conversations. But a familiar corporate logo on the screen caught Luka’s eye. It was the stylized 'V' of Volarić Shipping. The segment was about the launch of a new liquid natural gas tanker, the largest in the Croatian fleet, a triumph of his father’s relentless expansion. There was Stjepan Volarić, his face looking harder and more bulldog-like than ever on the screen, shaking hands with the Prime Minister. He spoke into the microphones about national pride and economic strength, his voice the same rumbling engine of ambition Luka remembered from the head of the long dining table. Luka watched the scene as if it were a broadcast from another planet. He felt no anger, no longing, no regret. He felt a faint, clinical pity for the man on the screen, a king shackled to his own throne, forever doomed to build bigger and bigger cages. Marko, sitting next to him with a bowl of stew, followed his gaze to the screen. "That's your family, isn't it?" Marko asked, his tone one of simple, un-judging curiosity. Luka didn't tense up. The question held no charge for him anymore. "It was," he said, turning his attention back to his own meal. "Pass the salt."

The period of quiet integration came to an abrupt end the following Monday. The entire company was assembled in the main briefing hall, the air electric with a sudden, palpable seriousness. The easy camaraderie of the barracks was replaced by a collective, disciplined attention. Their company commander, a major with a chest full of ribbons and eyes that seemed to have seen too much, stood at a podium in front of a large digital map of Europe. He didn't waste time on pleasantries. He spoke of their obligations as a NATO member state, of the volatile situation on the alliance’s eastern flank, and of the need for a robust, forward presence. He pointed to a spot on the map, a region bordering Russia. "In six weeks," the major announced, his voice echoing in the silent hall, "the 1st Mechanized Battalion will relieve the current battle group in Lithuania. This is not an exercise. This is Operation Enhanced Forward Presence. You will be the tip of the spear. Pack your cold-weather gear. The training is over." A low murmur swept through the hall before being instantly suppressed. The words hung in the air, heavy and solid. Lithuania. The Russian border. Tip of the spear. Luka looked across the rows of men and his eyes found Jurić’s. The corporal was not looking at the major or the map. He was looking at his squad, his gaze sweeping over each man—Kos, Marko, and finally, Luka. His expression was grim, focused, and completely resolute. This was it. The real world, with its sharp edges and its profound consequences, had finally arrived.The briefing ended, but the silence followed them out of the hall, a heavy, invisible cloak draped over the company. The usual post-briefing chatter, the casual complaints and dark jokes, were conspicuously absent. They walked back to the barracks with the grim purpose of men who had just been handed a death sentence and a mission order in the same folder. The air in the squad room, usually thick with the scent of coffee and easy camaraderie, was now charged with a new, metallic tension. Lithuania. The words echoed in the space between the bunks, a foreign, frozen sound. This was no longer a game of hide-and-seek in the Croatian hills. This was the edge of the map, where the old monsters were said to live.

Corporal Jurić was the first to break the spell. He tossed his field cap onto his bunk with a sharp, deliberate motion that drew every eye. He didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t need to. "Gear," he said, the single word cutting through the paralysis. "Empty every pack, every pouch. We do a full inventory. I want to see every piece of kit you own laid out on your bunks. What's worn, what's broken, what's missing—we requisition it tomorrow. We are not getting on that plane with a single frayed strap or a dull blade. You have until 1800." The order was a lifeline, a return to the familiar liturgy of military routine. It was something to do, a problem to be solved with hands and eyes, a welcome distraction from the vast, unsolvable problem that now loomed in their future. The room instantly filled with the sounds of zippers being pulled, of canvas and nylon being unceremoniously dumped, of metal clinking against metal. The machine was working again.

The next six weeks were a brutal, compressed education in the realities of modern warfare on a frozen frontier. The training regimen, already demanding, became relentless and hyper-focused. They spent days in full chemical warfare gear, their breath fogging the insides of their gas masks as they ran through drills, the world reduced to a claustrophobic, rubber-scented tunnel. They were drilled in advanced combat casualty care until the sequence of applying a tourniquet, packing a wound, and sealing a chest injury was a pure, unthinking reflex. They spent hours in simulators, learning to identify the electronic signatures of enemy drones and the subtle ground disturbances that hinted at an improvised explosive device. They were no longer just training to be soldiers; they were training to survive a specific, technologically advanced, and utterly ruthless enemy.

Luka found his mind, once a liability of overthinking, had become his greatest asset. He absorbed the complex radio protocols, memorized the technical specifications of enemy armor, and displayed an almost intuitive grasp of tactical map-reading under extreme stress. During a particularly hellish exercise simulating an artillery barrage, with smoke grenades filling the air and speakers blasting the deafening shriek and crash of incoming shells, he was able to guide his squad through a complex trench system purely from memory of the map he had studied for ten minutes that morning. He moved with a cold, analytical calm, his voice on the radio a steady, reassuring presence amidst the manufactured chaos. But while his mind adapted, his body was still playing catch-up. The physical toll was immense, leaving him collapsing into his bunk each night with a bone-deep weariness that felt as if his very cells were exhausted. He was not the strongest, nor the fastest. But as Jurić noted with a grunt one afternoon after a grueling forced march, "The rich boy doesn't quit. You have to give him that."

A week before deployment, they were given a final 48-hour leave. A last chance to touch the world they were preparing to defend. The barracks emptied out in a flood of men desperate for a final taste of home. Marko spent hours on the phone with his family, his deep voice soft as he described the weather in Petrinja and asked about the state of the winter wheat, carefully avoiding the one topic that mattered. Kos simply disappeared, melting into the civilian world as silently as he moved through the forest, seeking whatever solace his solitary nature required. Jurić sat on his bunk for a full hour, methodically sharpening a combat knife on a whetstone, the rhythmic *shhhk-shhhk* of steel on stone the only sound in the nearly empty room, his face a mask of concentration.

Luka had nowhere to go. The hostel in Zagreb felt like a lifetime ago, and the city itself held nothing for him but ghosts. He was a man without a mailing address. As he sat on the edge of his bunk, the unusual quiet of the barracks pressing in on him, the old voice returned. It was Kiko’s voice, a gravelly whisper from the locked box in his memory. *Well, here we are. The tip of the spear. Sounds pointy. You wanted real? You wanted purpose? Congratulations, you found it. The purpose of a nail is to meet a hammer. Hope you enjoy the impact.* The voice was no longer a separate entity on his hand; it was a cold knot of dread in his own gut. He had wanted to feel something, and now he was feeling the oldest, most primal emotion of all: fear. It was a cold, clean fear, not the murky, existential dread of his penthouse days. This fear had a name—Lithuania—and a shape—the silhouette of a T-90 tank. He stood up, walked to the window, and looked out at the peaceful Croatian landscape, the setting sun painting the clouds in hues of orange and purple. He took a deep breath, held it, and let it out slowly, just as he did on the range. He acknowledged the fear. He let it exist. But he did not let it take control. He was the one holding the rifle now.

The final day was a somber, ritualistic affair. Their new cold-weather gear was issued, strange, bulky layers of white and grey camouflage that made them look like arctic explorers. They packed their main rucksacks and their go-bags, every item checked and double-checked. In the afternoon, they were given time to write letters. A stack of plain envelopes was placed on a table. The "just in case" letters. Luka sat on his bunk with a pen and a blank sheet of paper, faced with the absurd reality of his situation. Who would he write to? His father, who had legally erased him? Maja, who considered him detritus? There was only one person. He began to write, the words flowing with a surprising ease. *To the finder of this letter: Please deliver the enclosed keycard and safe combination to the security desk of the tower at Savska 9. Tell them it is for Kiko.* He paused, then continued, a letter to a puppet, a letter to himself. *Kiko, if you're reading this, it means I didn't keep my promise. I'm sorry. I hope you're not scared in the dark. I wasn't, not at the end. I found what I was looking for. It was never about the dirt or the fear. It was about the men I stood next to. It was about earning my place. It was real. Goodbye, my friend.* He sealed the letter, his name and service number on the front, and placed it on the pile with the others, a final piece of paperwork in a life that was now entirely regulated.

The cavernous belly of the C-130 transport plane was bathed in a dim, blood-red light. The noise was deafening, a constant, bone-jarring roar from the four massive turboprop engines. The men sat in tight rows on nylon webbing seats, their faces grim and shadowed, their new white gear making them look like a conclave of ghosts. Luka sat across from Marko, whose knuckles were white where he gripped his rifle. Jurić was near the ramp, his face impassive, his eyes scanning his men. Kos had his eyes closed, though Luka knew he wasn't asleep. As the plane taxied and turned onto the runway, the roar of the engines intensified, the entire airframe vibrating with contained power. Luka felt the powerful thrust push him back into his seat. He watched the lights of the airfield streak past the single small porthole, and then, with a lurch that lifted his stomach into his throat, they were airborne. He was ascending into the clouds once more, but this time he was not alone in a glass tower looking down. He was in the heart of a machine, surrounded by his brothers, heading into the dark. He closed his eyes, not in fear, but in acceptance. The long fall from his old life was over. The real ascent had just begun.The world outside the descending ramp of the C-130 was not a place, but an element. The roar of the engines was abruptly shouldered aside by a silence so profound it seemed to have its own pressure, and the recycled air of the cabin was replaced by a solid wall of cold that stole the breath from their lungs and turned it into instantaneous plumes of white vapour. It was a cold that felt ancient and predatory, a palpable presence that clung to exposed skin with the stinging bite of a thousand tiny needles. The landscape visible in the harsh glare of the airfield’s floodlights was a study in absolute white and black, a world bleached of all colour and warmth. The men of the Tigers, hardened by Croatian winters, shuffled down the ramp with a new, shared apprehension. This was different. This was arctic.

Their new home, a forward operating base carved into a vast, snow-covered pine forest, was a spartan collection of prefabricated buildings and HESCO barriers, all connected by cleared gravel paths that crunched loudly under their boots. It was a multinational city in miniature, with the flags of a dozen NATO countries snapping stiffly in the wind. The unit they were relieving, a company of weary-looking Americans, greeted them with the grim, knowing smiles of men who had finished their tour. The handover was a whirlwind of technical briefings, intelligence updates, and informal warnings. They were shown maps crisscrossed with red lines marking Russian electronic warfare zones, satellite photos of troop concentrations just across the border, and binders filled with the “pattern of life” of the opposing force—the predictable routines of their patrols, the typical flight paths of their drones. “They’ll test you,” a tired American captain told Jurić, his voice flat. “First few weeks, they’ll poke and prod. Fly a drone a little closer than usual, jam your comms for thirty seconds, see if you’re sleeping. They want to know who they’re dealing with.”

The Croatian squad took over a long, narrow room in one of the barracks, the space smelling faintly of stale coffee and the departing Americans’ anxieties. There was no settling in, no period of adjustment. Within hours of arrival, Jurić had them on their first rotation. They were assigned a sector of the border, a twenty-kilometer stretch of pine forest, frozen marsh, and open fields, marked by a simple, low fence and a line of brightly painted posts that seemed a laughably inadequate demarcation between two worlds. Their first patrol was in a Patria armored vehicle, its eight wheels churning through the deep snow, the heater blasting a futile stream of warmth that barely kept the inside of the cabin above freezing. Inside, the mood was tense and focused. Luka sat by a viewport, his eyes scanning the endless, monotonous wall of white-barked birch and dark pines, a landscape that seemed designed to hide things.

After an hour, Jurić’s voice crackled over the internal comms. “Dismount. We walk the line. Two-kilometer loop. Kos, you have overwatch from the vehicle. Stay on the thermal. Let’s go.” The rear ramp of the Patria lowered with a hydraulic sigh, exposing them once more to the brutal cold. The silence was immediate and absolute, broken only by the wind whispering through the high branches and the rhythmic crunch of their boots on the crystalline snow. They moved in a staggered file, their white camouflage making them ghostly apparitions against the snow, their breath misting in front of their faces. The border fence was a flimsy, almost pathetic thing, sagging in places under the weight of the snow. Beyond it lay more of the same—an identical forest, an identical blanket of white. Yet the air on that side felt different, charged with a hostile, invisible energy. It was Russia.

Luka fell into the rhythm of the patrol, his senses heightened to an almost painful degree. Every snap of a frozen twig, every gust of wind that stirred the snow, registered as a potential threat. He found himself using Vuko’s technique without conscious thought, his left eye tracing the terrain ahead, his right eye open to the wider world, a disorienting but comprehensive field of vision. They were halfway through their walking loop, moving through a section of dense forest, when he felt it. It wasn’t a sight or a sound, but a subtle break in the pattern, a flicker in the matrix of his perception. High above the treetops, almost invisible against the flat, grey sky, a small drone was moving on a lazy, circular path. It was a familiar sight; the briefings had shown them the standard Russian surveillance drone patterns, a predictable figure-eight route flown well on their own side of the border.

But this was different. Luka stopped, raising his binoculars, his fingers already numb in their thick gloves. He tracked the drone, its shape a small, dark cross against the clouds. He watched it complete one circuit, then another. It was not flying a figure-eight. It was flying a slow, deliberate spiral, each rotation bringing it infinitesimally closer to the border line. It was a deviation of only a few dozen meters from the established pattern, a change so subtle it would be dismissed by most as a fluke, a pilot getting lazy. But to Luka, whose entire life had been a study in the tiny deviations of a polished, predictable world, it felt like a signature. It was a probe. A test. It was the whisper of a question being asked in the sky above them.

He keyed his radio, his voice a low murmur that barely disturbed the immense silence. “Jurić. Sova-1 is off-pattern.” He used their designation for the common enemy drone. “It’s in a spiral. Inward trajectory. Still on their side, but it’s testing the line.” Jurić stopped the column with a hand signal. He didn’t question Luka. He simply raised his own optics. After a moment, his voice came back, tight and low. “I see it. It’s a probe. They know we’re the new rotation. They’re seeing what we notice.” He scanned the treeline, his eyes missing nothing. “Marko, Volarić, stay on the drone. Everyone else, scan your sectors. This is where they’d pair a probe with something else. Look for a ground spotter. Look for anything.” The squad melted into the trees, their weapons up, their easy patrol transformed into a high-stakes chess match played across a frozen board.

Luka kept his eyes on the drone, but his awareness was everywhere. He could feel the presence of his squad mates around him, the silent, shared tension that bound them together. This was it. This was the point where the abstract threat became a specific, immediate reality. He was cold, his fingers ached, and a knot of icy fear was tightening in his stomach. But layered over the fear was something else, something powerful and clear: a sense of profound, crystalline focus. He was not a prisoner in a glass tower, watching a city breathe. He was a sentinel on a wall at the edge of the world, and he was watching his enemy’s every breath.The world seemed to be holding its breath with them. For a long, stretched minute, the only sound was the sigh of the wind and the faint, almost subliminal hum of the drone overhead, a malevolent insect drawing an insult against the grey sky. The men of the squad were statues carved from snow and steel, their training a cage holding back the primal urge to look up, to expose themselves, to react. They simply scanned their sectors, their trust in Luka’s eyes and Jurić’s command absolute. The cold was a physical weight, pressing in on them, trying to find a way through the layers of their high-tech gear, a constant, attritional enemy.

Luka’s focus remained split, a strange and strenuous mental gymnastics. His left eye, aided by the rifle scope, stayed on the distant trees beyond the fence, searching for the glint of an optic, the shape of a helmet, the ground spotter Jurić had predicted. His right eye, naked and unfocused, watched the drone’s slow, tightening spiral. And in the space between those two realities, his mind raced, sifting through the intelligence briefings, the threat assessments, the endless "what if" scenarios they had drilled. A drone probe was standard. But pairing it with a ground unit was risky for the probing force. There had to be something else, another layer to the test, something less tangible than a man with a pair of binoculars.

As he shifted his weight slightly, a flicker of light on his wrist caught his attention. It was the small tactical data slate, a ruggedized screen showing their position on a digital map. The screen, which should have been displaying a static topographical layout, had gone blank for a second, then refreshed. A single line of text glowed in stark green pixels against the black background. It was not a system alert or a command from Jurić. It was a sentence, typed in perfect, unnerving Croatian.

*IZGUBLJEN, MALI BOGATAŠ?*

Lost, little rich boy?

The air in Luka’s lungs turned to ice. The cold he felt was no longer from the Lithuanian winter; it was a deep, internal freeze, a violation so profound it momentarily shattered his composure. This wasn't a random probe. This wasn't a test of the unit. This was a message. For him. They knew who he was. They had sifted through the digital ether, through the public records and society pages of a life he had burned to the ground, and had reached across a contested border to tap him on the shoulder. They were in his head. The sterile, distant threat had just become hideously, intimately personal. His past, the very thing he had joined the army to escape, had been weaponized and fired at him from an unseen enemy.

A wave of nausea, the ghost of old anxieties, washed over him. The urge to smash the device, to look wildly around into the woods, was immense. But then, the years of therapy and the last six months of brutal discipline slammed together in his mind. He took a single, shuddering breath, the air burning his lungs. He forced the panic down, compressing it into a small, hard knot of cold fury in his gut. He was a soldier. He was on watch. He had a duty. He keyed his radio, his thumb clumsy with cold but his voice a miracle of control, a flat, professional monotone.

"Jurić," he whispered. "I have an unauthorized data push on my nav-slate. A text injection." He did not mention the content. The what was irrelevant. The how was the attack.

Jurić’s reaction was instantaneous. There was no request for clarification, no moment of disbelief. "Kill it," he snapped over the comms. "Power down the slate completely. Kos, eyes on the drone. Marko, rear security. We're breaking contact. We move west to rally point Bravo, now. Silent. Go."

The order was a release. The squad moved with a liquid, predatory grace, their ghostly forms detaching from the trees and slipping deeper into the forest, leaving behind nothing but footprints that the wind was already starting to erase. The walk back to the armored vehicle was a torment of a different kind. The physical threat of a hidden enemy seemed to have receded, replaced by something far more insidious. Every shadow felt deeper, the wind seemed to carry whispers, and the unseen enemy was no longer simply over the fence; they were in the airwaves, in their electronics, in their pasts. They were ghosts in the machine.

Inside the relative warmth and loud, rumbling safety of the Patria, the squad stripped off their snow-caked outer layers. The tension was a palpable thing, thick and suffocating. Jurić was already on the main radio to base command, his voice a low, clipped series of facts, relaying the drone’s deviation and the electronic intrusion, carefully omitting the specific details of the message until he could deliver them in a secure environment. When he finished, he turned, his hard eyes finding Luka in the dim red light of the cabin. The rest of the squad fell silent, their attention focused. "Volarić," Jurić said, his voice even. "Report the content of the message. Verbatim."

Luka looked at the faces around him—Marko’s broad, concerned face; Kos’s gaunt, unreadable features; the tired, grim expressions of the others. He was bracing for the inevitable return of his old status, the rich boy, the outsider, the weak link whose past was now a liability to them all. "It said," Luka’s voice was quiet but steady, "‘Lost, little rich boy?’ In Croatian."

A heavy silence descended on the cabin. No one laughed. No one smirked. Kos slowly shook his head, a look of grim understanding on his face. Marko swore, a low, vicious curse under his breath, and then reached across the narrow aisle, placing a heavy, reassuring hand on Luka’s shoulder. It was a simple, profound gesture of solidarity. Jurić’s jaw tightened, a muscle jumping in his cheek. "They did their homework," he stated, the words like chips of ice. "They're trying to get inside our heads. Trying to fracture the unit. Isolate you." He looked directly at Luka, his gaze intense. "They picked the wrong squad." The words were not a comfort; they were a declaration of war, a promise. Luka was not a liability. An attack on him was an attack on them all. The enemy, in their attempt to isolate him, had instead irrevocably cemented his place within the heart of the squad.

Lying in his bunk that night, the processed air of the barracks humming around him, Luka stared into the darkness. The fear had subsided, leaving behind a cold, clear, and unfamiliar landscape in his mind. He had run from a world of polished surfaces and hollow men, a world of abstract, bloodless conflict waged in boardrooms and on stock tickers. He had sought something real. And he had found it. The real was not just the sting of the cold or the ache in his muscles. It was the intimate, personal nature of a modern war, fought not just with bullets and shells, but with bits and bytes, with psychology and with the ghosts of a man's own life. The enemy knew his name. He was no longer an anonymous cog, but a specific target. And in a strange, terrifying way, it was the most validating feeling in the world. He had never mattered less in the grand scheme of things, and he had never been more significant. The boy in the penthouse had been invisible. The soldier on the border was a target. And for the first time, Luka Volarić truly felt seen.The formal debriefing took place in a windowless container that had been converted into a secure intelligence office. The air was cold and recycled, scrubbed clean of the human scents of the barracks and smelling only of electronics and institutional floor wax. It was a world Luka understood from his past—a sterile box where power was wielded through information, not physicality. Opposite him sat a woman he had not seen before, Captain Novak from the Croatian military intelligence service. She was in her late thirties, with sharp, intelligent features and eyes that didn’t just look at him, but seemed to scan him for data points. Her uniform was perfectly pressed, a stark contrast to the lived-in, functional gear of the infantrymen. With her was a grim-faced Lithuanian officer and, standing by the door like a guard dog at the gates of hell, Corporal Jurić.

Jurić had insisted on being present, a breach of protocol that Novak had reluctantly allowed after a tense, low-voiced argument outside the door. His presence fundamentally changed the room’s dynamic. He was not there as a subordinate, but as a guardian, his arms crossed over his chest, his gaze fixed on Novak, making it clear that Luka was his soldier, his responsibility, and not merely an intelligence asset to be dissected. Novak directed her questions to Luka, her tone clinical and devoid of emotion. She was not interested in how he felt. She wanted to know the exact time of the data push, the latency of the slate's refresh, the specific font of the text. She treated the violation of his psyche as a system breach, a bug in the code that needed to be patched.

The conversation in the squad room that evening was studiously, almost aggressively normal. The men talked about the new shipment of rations, complained about the shocking quality of the instant coffee, and argued about which Croatian football team would win the league. But beneath the surface, the dynamic had shifted. An invisible perimeter had been drawn around Luka, not of exclusion, but of protection. When he went to get water, another member of the squad would happen to get up and walk in the same direction. When he was cleaning his rifle, Kos silently passed him a specialized tool for cleaning the gas piston, a small, unspoken gesture of inclusion. They were treating his psychological vulnerability as if it were a physical wound, subtly covering his flank, ensuring he was never left isolated. They were a pack, and the enemy had singled out one of their own, and the pack's response was to close ranks until their shoulders were touching.

That night, sleep offered no refuge. In the darkness of the barracks, the silence broken only by the breathing of the men around him, Luka’s mind was a battlefield. The words on the slate glowed behind his eyelids: *Lost, little rich boy?* The voice of Kiko, which had been a fading echo, returned with a vengeance, no longer a rasping puppet on his hand but a cold, clear thought in his own head. *See?* it whispered. *You wore the uniform, you got the calluses, you played the game. But you can’t erase the source code. You’re still him. The man who polishes glasses in a glass tower. And they know it.* He felt a familiar, sickening pull, the gravity of his old emptiness trying to reclaim him. But then another voice, harder and rougher, cut through it. The voice of Sergeant Vuko. *Stop fighting yourself. See the whole picture.* He wasn't just the boy in the tower anymore. He was also the man who had scaled the Wall, the soldier who had earned his place, the observer who had seen the flank. The two identities were at war within him. He gritted his teeth in the dark, a cold fury solidifying inside him. They had used his past to attack him. He would use their attack to forge his future.

The opportunity came sooner than he expected. The next morning, Captain Novak intercepted him and Jurić on their way to the armory. She ignored Jurić’s hostile glare and addressed Luka directly. "The enemy has opened a line of communication with you, Private," she stated, her tone brisk. "My superiors are very interested in keeping that line open. We want to give you a modified data slate. It will look and function identically to your current one, but it will have a monitoring and tracing program running in the background. If they contact you again, we want to let them. We want to analyze their methods, their timing, their technical signature. We want to see what else they know." She paused, her gaze locking onto his. "We want you to talk back."

Jurić exploded. It was not the loud, performative anger of a drill sergeant, but a low, dangerous rumble that made the air feel thick. "Absolutely not," he snarled. "You're not painting a target on my soldier. You're not turning my rifleman into a goddamn honey trap for spooks. His job is to watch the line and follow my orders. Your job is to give us intel, not create vulnerabilities in my squad. This conversation is over." He made a move to steer Luka away, a clear dismissal of Novak’s authority in the face of his own duty of care.

But Luka didn’t move. He stood his ground, a fixed point between the immovable object of his corporal’s protection and the irresistible force of the intelligence officer’s mission. He looked at Jurić, his eyes conveying a silent message of gratitude and respect for the man’s fierce loyalty. Then he turned to Captain Novak. The fear was still there, a cold snake in his gut, but the cold fury was stronger. This was not a command. It was a choice. For his entire life, choices had been made for him, his path paved in gold and expectation. He had joined the army to reclaim his own agency, and here it was, presented to him in its most dangerous and vital form. "They came for me," Luka said, his voice quiet but hard as forged steel. "They tried to get in my head." He met Novak's analytical gaze. "Let them try again. I'll do it."

Jurić swore under his breath, a string of creative and heartfelt curses, but he did not countermand Luka’s decision. He saw the look in his private's eyes—the same focused, resolute look he’d seen when Luka was guiding them through the storm, the same look he saw in the mirror every morning. It was the look of a soldier who had accepted a mission. Novak’s expression remained unchanged, but a flicker of satisfaction, of a calculated risk paying off, crossed her eyes. "Good," she said simply. "My technician will have the device ready for you by midday." She gave a curt nod and walked away, her boots crunching decisively on the frozen gravel, leaving Luka standing with his furious, protective, and ultimately subordinate corporal. The game had changed. He had willingly stepped onto a new, invisible battlefield, and the first move was his to make.The new data slate looked identical to the old one, but it felt immeasurably heavier in Luka’s hand. It was handed to him not by Captain Novak, but by a quiet, perpetually nervous signals technician in a cramped, overheated workshop that smelled of solder and ozone. The technician’s hands trembled slightly as he explained the features, avoiding eye contact as if the device itself were radioactive. It was a listening post and a homing beacon, a weapon disguised as a tool. Jurić stood by the door throughout the entire briefing, his presence a silent, thunderous protest. He did not speak, but his glare promised dire consequences for the technician, for Novak, and for the entire intelligence branch if this decision went wrong. When Luka finally took the slate, its cold, plastic shell felt like a contract he had just signed in blood.

Life on the line devolved into a state of suspended, high-strung animation. The routine of patrols, guard duty, and maintenance continued with relentless monotony, but for Luka, every moment was now bifurcated. There was the physical world of snow, steel, and biting wind, and then there was the silent, potential world of the small screen in his pouch. He found himself developing a nervous tic, his fingers constantly brushing against the pouch as if to reassure himself the device was still there, or perhaps to check if it had grown warm with an incoming message. The waiting was a unique and exquisite form of torture, a constant, low-grade hum of dread that vibrated just beneath the surface of his skin. The enemy was no longer a distant threat on the other side of a fence; they were a potential whisper in his pocket, an intimate and patient stalker.

The squad’s reaction was a silent conspiracy of protection. They did not speak of the slate or the mission, but its presence was a ghost at their table. Jurić subtly altered the patrol formations, ensuring Luka was never the point man or the last man in the file, always keeping him buffered by the physical presence of other soldiers. During their downtime in the barracks, the easy silences that had once been comfortable were now filled with a forced, almost cheerful chatter, as if the men were collectively trying to build a wall of sound to keep the silence of the slate at bay. Marko would engage him in pointless, detailed discussions about the mechanics of a diesel engine, while Kos would sit across from him, cleaning his rifle with meticulous, unhurried movements, his quiet presence a form of overwatch. They had instinctively understood what Jurić had: that the target was not Luka’s body, but his mind. Their defense was not to give him space, but to deny the enemy the one thing they needed to succeed: isolation.

Three days passed, each one a slow grind of twenty-four tense hours. The drone flew its predictable patterns. The border remained quiet. The cold deepened. On the fourth night, Luka was on watch in a cramped, sandbagged observation post overlooking a frozen river that marked a bend in the border. The night was brilliantly, cruelly clear, the sky a vast canopy of stars so bright they seemed to mock the darkness below. It was two in the morning, the hour of lowest morale, when the mind is most vulnerable to doubt. He was alone, but connected by radio to the main base and by an invisible thread to Marko, who was in a similar post five hundred meters down the line. To pass the time and stay alert, he was methodically field-stripping his rifle’s bolt, his fingers moving with a familiar, practiced grace in the dim red light of the post. His data slate lay beside him, its screen dark. Then, it lit up.

There was no alert, no sound. Just a soft, green glow in the darkness. Luka’s hands stopped moving. The small metal parts of the bolt felt suddenly huge and clumsy in his fingers. He stared at the screen, his heart a slow, heavy drum against his ribs. It wasn’t a text message this time. It was an image, slowly rendering line by line as if being transmitted over a weak signal. It was a high-resolution photograph. He recognized it instantly. It was the view from his penthouse, at night. The city of Zagreb was spread out below, a breathtaking tapestry of glittering lights. The frantic ballet of the blue trams, the twin spires of the cathedral, the green embrace of Medvednica mountain—it was all there. It was a photograph taken from the exact spot where he used to stand, a postcard from a dead life. Beneath the image, a single line of text faded in.

*The view from Savska Street was better, wasn't it?*

The attack was masterful. It wasn't an insult; it was a temptation. It was a whisper of comfort, of warmth, of a life without fear or cold or the crushing weight of responsibility. It was a perfectly aimed dart of nostalgia, designed to bypass the soldier’s armor and strike at the soft, weary heart of the man. For a moment, Luka felt himself yielding to it. He could almost smell the polished marble, feel the warmth of the brandy in a crystal tumbler, hear the expensive silence. His entire body ached with a profound longing for that effortless world. The voice of his old self, the voice of Kiko, rose up, no longer a whisper but a siren’s song. *He’s right. Look at it. What are you doing here? Freezing in a hole for men who wouldn’t spit on you if you were on fire. Go home. You can still go home.*

He closed his eyes, the image of Zagreb burning behind his lids. He felt the cold of the rifle parts in his hands. He heard the distant, steady breathing of Marko over the open comm channel, a faint, reassuring hiss. He thought of Jurić’s face, a mask of grim loyalty. He thought of Kos’s gift of beeswax and turpentine. These were his new reference points. This was his new view. He was not that man anymore. That man was a ghost, and the enemy was trying to make him haunt himself. He opened his eyes, the memory of Zagreb fading, replaced by the stark, frozen reality of the Lithuanian night. His fury was a cold, clean flame. He picked up the slate. His thumbs, thick and clumsy in their gloves, hovered over the virtual keyboard. Novak wanted him to talk. Jurić wanted him to be silent. He would do neither. He would answer. He typed a short, simple sentence.

*The field of fire is better here.*

He hit send. The screen flickered and went dark. The message was gone, fired back into the digital void. It was a perfect synthesis of his two selves. It acknowledged their premise—the “view”—but redefined it in the stark, brutalist language of his new world. It was a confession and a defiance. It told them that yes, he was the rich boy from Savska street, but that man was now a weapon, and he was aiming it right back at them. A profound, almost shocking calm settled over him. He picked up the pieces of his rifle bolt and began to reassemble them, his hands no longer shaking, his movements once again sure and precise. The war of whispers had begun, and he had just fired the first shot.The silence that followed his reply was a living thing. It filled the small observation post, pressing in on Luka with a weight far greater than the tonnes of sandbags and frozen earth that surrounded him. For a full minute, he did not move, his thumbs still hovering over the dark screen, his entire being coiled like a spring, waiting for a response, for an alarm, for the world to change. But nothing happened. The stars continued their cold, indifferent march across the sky. The wind whispered its ancient, unintelligible secrets through the pines. His radio hissed with the faint, steady sound of Marko’s distant breathing. The world had not changed at all, and yet, for Luka, everything was different. He had reached back into the void that had been his past, taken the name the enemy had thrown at him like a stone, and hurled it back as a weapon. He was no longer just the bait. He was a combatant in a war only he could fight. The profound terror of that realization was matched only by the shocking, exhilarating sense of purpose that came with it.

The aftermath arrived not with a bang, but with the crunch of boots on gravel. As soon as his patrol returned to the main base, before he could even shed the heavy outer layers of his gear, he was met by a stone-faced Jurić, whose eyes were burning with a cold fire. The corporal jerked his head towards the secure intelligence container without a word, the command absolute. Inside, Captain Novak was waiting, a thin, almost imperceptible smile playing on her lips. She held a tablet displaying a transcript of his exchange. Jurić closed the door behind them, shutting them in, the small room feeling like an interrogation cell. He planted his feet and crossed his arms, a bulldog guarding a bone, his anger a palpable force field.

“‘The field of fire is better here,’” Novak read aloud, her voice cool and appreciative, as if analyzing a particularly elegant move in a chess game. “An exceptional piece of psychological judo, Private. You took their narrative and inverted it. You confirmed your identity while simultaneously asserting your new allegiance. You’ve given them a riddle to solve. They were expecting to find a broken aristocrat, and instead, they’ve found a philosopher-king with a rifle.” She looked up from the tablet, her analytical gaze locking onto him. “You’ve also escalated this engagement to a personal duel. Do you understand the implications?”

Before Luka could answer, Jurić’s voice cut through the air, a low, dangerous growl. “I understand the implications. The implication is that you’ve allowed my soldier to taunt an assassin who knows his name and his life story. The implication is that every time he steps outside this wire, he’ll have a personal bullseye painted on his back. You’re using him as a trolling motor to see what bites, Captain. This isn't a game.”

“With respect, Corporal, everything is a game until the shooting starts, and even then, it’s just a game with higher stakes,” Novak retorted, her coolness a deliberate counterpoint to Jurić’s heat. “Your soldier just proved he’s one of the few people on this entire border who can play it. They have been inside our networks for months, leaving ghost signals, testing our firewalls. This is the first time we’ve had a direct, personal contact. This is an unprecedented intelligence opportunity.” She turned back to Luka, her voice softening almost imperceptibly. “But the Corporal is right. The risk is now entirely yours. You seized the initiative. The question is, do you wish to relinquish it?”

Luka felt the two powerful forces of his new life pulling at him: Jurić’s fierce, paternal need to protect him, and Novak’s cold, clinical need to use him. Both were, in their own way, a form of respect. He looked at Jurić, at the genuine, terrified anger in the man’s eyes, and felt a surge of gratitude so profound it almost buckled his knees. Then he looked at Novak, who was offering him a choice that was no choice at all. To retreat now would be to validate the enemy’s premise, to admit he was still the boy from Savska Street, scared of the dark. “They chose the battlefield, Captain,” Luka said, his voice quiet but firm. “They put my head in the game. I can’t take it out now. All I can do is play.”

The enemy’s response to his defiance was a terrifying, weaponized silence. For five days, the slate remained dark. The drone resumed its predictable, lazy figure-eights. The border was quiet, the forest locked in a frozen, watchful stillness. The silence was far more unnerving than the messages had been. It was the silence of a predator re-evaluating its prey, the quiet intake of breath before a strike. The waiting frayed Luka’s nerves raw. He performed his duties with flawless, robotic precision, but his mind was constantly elsewhere, listening for a whisper in the static, waiting for the other shoe to drop. The squad maintained its protective bubble, their forced normalcy a constant, loving lie. They were all waiting with him.

The strike came on a Tuesday morning, during a routine logistics run. Luka was in the gunner’s turret of the Patria, his head and shoulders exposed to the biting wind as he manned the heavy machine gun, a position he’d been assigned for its superior field of view. They were moving along a cleared track that ran parallel to the border, about a kilometer inside their own territory. Jurić was driving, and Marko was on the internal comms. The world was a blinding panorama of white snow and black trees. Suddenly, there was a sound like a hornet cracking past his ear, followed instantly by the sharp, ringing *PANG* of an impact on the turret’s armored gun shield, not three inches from the left side of his head. He instinctively ducked, his heart hammering against his ribs, as Jurić screamed into the comms, “Contact! Sniper!” and slammed the accelerator, the massive vehicle lurching forward as it sought cover.

Luka cautiously raised his head. A perfect, star-shaped crater had appeared in the thick, ballistic glass of the gun shield, right at eye level. It had not penetrated, but the message was unambiguous. It was a shot that had been calculated to miss by the barest of margins. It was a demonstration of skill. A statement. They had found him. They had ranged him. They could touch him whenever they wanted. As the Patria careened into the relative safety of a thicket of pines, the men inside shouting status reports, Luka felt a familiar vibration from the pouch on his chest. His hand, shaking now with a violent, uncontrollable tremor, pulled out the slate. The squad in the cabin below went silent as they saw the green glow illuminate his face.

The screen wasn’t displaying a picture or a long sentence. It was just a handful of words, each one a hammer blow that landed with the same shocking force as the bullet that had just missed his skull.

*I see you, rich boy. Next time, three inches to the left.*The green glow of the slate illuminated Luka’s face, painting it in the sickly, unreal colours of a terminal patient’s heart monitor. The tremor in his hand was no longer a subtle vibration; it was a violent, uncontrollable quake, a physical manifestation of the psychic shockwave that had just ripped through him. The cabin of the Patria, which moments before had been a cacophony of shouted commands and engine roar, fell into a deep, ringing silence. Every man inside—Jurić at the wheel, Marko at the comms station, the two other riflemen—was frozen, their eyes locked on the small, bright screen that had become the epicenter of their world. They could not read the words from where they sat, but they could read the devastation on Luka’s face.

“Volarić,” Jurić’s voice was a raw, strangled thing, forced through a throat tight with fury. “Report.”

Luka’s mouth was dry, his tongue a useless piece of leather. He swallowed, the sound unnaturally loud in the sudden quiet. He read the words aloud, his own voice a stranger’s, a flat, dead monotone that seemed to absorb all the life from the air. “‘I see you, rich boy. Next time, three inches to the left.’”

A collective, sharp intake of breath hissed through the cabin. Marko uttered a single, venomous curse, his face a mask of disbelief and rage. The words hung in the air, obscene and undeniable. It was a death threat, a promise, and a joke all rolled into one. The sniper was not just a soldier on the other side of a line; he was a critic, a taunting spectre who knew Luka’s history and was now judging his present with lethal precision. The bullet had been a statement of capability. The message was a statement of intent. The enemy’s goal was not to kill him, not yet. It was to break him, to prove that beneath the uniform and the calluses, the terrified boy from the penthouse was still in there, and that he could be made to scream.

Jurić’s reaction was terrifying in its coldness. The hot anger he had shown Novak was gone, replaced by a glacial, murderous calm. His knuckles were white on the steering wheel, his jaw set so hard it seemed carved from stone. He did not waste a single word. He keyed the main radio. “Command, this is Tiger-2. We are breaking contact and returning to base. I have a ‘Broken Arrow’ situation regarding my asset. Repeat, Broken Arrow. Out.” The code was extreme, reserved for a compromised asset in imminent, mortal danger. Without waiting for a reply, he threw the massive vehicle into a gear and sent it tearing back down the track towards the FOB, its engine screaming in protest, every man inside bracing against the violent, lurching ride, the silence in the cabin now heavier and more dreadful than any sound.

Their return to base was like the arrival of a plague ship. The “Broken Arrow” call had sent ripples of alarm through the entire command structure. As the Patria screeched to a halt, a squad of military police was already there to meet them, establishing a perimeter. Luka was escorted from the vehicle, the other members of his squad flanking him like a praetorian guard, their faces grim, their hands never far from their weapons. The looks they received from other soldiers were a mixture of fear, morbid curiosity, and pity. The invisible war had just become brutally visible, and Luka was its ground zero. He was no longer just a soldier; he was a piece of living, breathing, targeted intelligence, a man whose past was actively trying to kill him.

The debriefing was not a conversation; it was an autopsy. Novak, Jurić, the Lithuanian base commander, and a stern, eagle-faced NATO colonel were all crammed into the secure container, the air thick with unsaid accusations. This time, Jurić did not stand by the door. He stood beside Luka’s chair, a physical barrier, his presence a constant, furious challenge. Novak’s professional composure had fractured. Her face was pale, her hands clasped so tightly on the table they were bloodless. The game had gone live, and she was the one who had pushed the button. The colonel, a man accustomed to dealing in acceptable losses and strategic risks, looked at Luka with a cold, appraising eye, as if trying to calculate the value of the intelligence he represented versus the cost of the diplomatic incident his death would cause.

“He’s compromised,” the Lithuanian commander stated, his voice thick with a barely suppressed anger. “The sniper has his scent. He cannot remain on the line. He is a danger to himself and every man around him. He needs to be evacuated. Now.”

“Evacuation is an admission of defeat,” Novak countered, her voice strained but fighting to retain its authority. “We would be handing them a major psychological victory. They targeted him to force our hand, to make us react. If we pull him, we show them their methods work.”

“This is not a psychological victory, Captain! This is a high-velocity tungsten round!” Jurić’s voice was a low roar, shaking the very walls of the container. He slammed Luka’s slate down on the table, the screen lighting up with the still-present message. “This is the victory! They can touch my man whenever they want. Your ‘asset’ is a dead man walking, and you’re arguing about narrative. He’s off the line. That is not a request.”

As they argued over his fate, Luka felt a strange, profound detachment. He was sitting right there, the subject of their debate, yet he felt as if he were floating near the ceiling, watching a play about someone else. He looked at the star-shaped crater on the ballistic glass of the gun shield, which Jurić had brought in as evidence. Three inches. The space between his life and his death. The space the sniper had contemptuously left as a calling card. He felt the phantom impact, the rush of wind, the sudden, shocking realization of his own mortality. The fear was a physical presence, a cold, heavy animal coiled in his gut. But beneath the fear, the core of cold fury he had been nursing for days began to glow with a new, intense heat. They had done this to him. They had reached into his past and tried to kill him with it. They thought he was still the boy in the tower. They were wrong.

The decision was made above his head. The NATO colonel, siding with the undeniable logic of risk aversion, ordered Luka confined to the base. He was officially removed from all patrol duties, a soldier in internal exile. When he walked back into the barracks, the news had already spread. The room fell silent. The men of his squad, his brothers, looked at him with a mixture of relief and a terrible, shared guilt. They were safe because he was now a prisoner. He walked to his bunk and sat down, the weight of his new reality crashing down on him. He was a liability. A target. A man so dangerous he had to be locked away from the war. It was a fate worse than any guard duty, a prison more profound than the one he had escaped in Zagreb.

That night, unable to sleep, he sat in the empty mess hall, nursing a cup of coffee that had long gone cold. The base was quiet, the men of his squad out on the line, out in the cold, doing the job he was now forbidden from doing. He was alone, truly and utterly alone, just as the enemy wanted. He could feel the threads of his old life, the luxurious emptiness, the polished despair, reaching for him across the continents, whispering that it was time to go home, that he had tried and failed, that he was, and always would be, the little rich boy. Then Kos walked in. The gaunt sniper moved with his usual ghostly silence, his face shadowed and unreadable. He did not speak. He simply sat down opposite Luka, placing his own massive, high-powered sniper rifle on the table between them. He began to disassemble it with slow, deliberate movements, laying out the complex, beautifully machined parts on a clean cloth. The message was as clear and as potent as the one on the slate. It was not a threat, but a promise. It said: *They have one. We have one, too.* In the shared, silent language of their craft, Kos was telling him that this was now a duel between professionals, and he was on Luka’s side. He was not just a target. He was a cause. And a sniper of his own was preparing for battle.The days that followed were a masterclass in a new kind of silence. It was not the polished, expensive silence of his penthouse, nor the deep, peaceful silence of an exhausted barracks. It was the hollow, echoing silence of uselessness. Luka’s world shrank to the confines of the forward operating base, a small, heavily guarded island in a sea of frozen forest where he was the sole castaway. He was a soldier with no war to fight, a rifleman whose rifle was locked in the armory, a member of a squad who was no longer allowed to stand beside them. He would wake in the pre-dawn darkness to the familiar, comforting sounds of his squad preparing for patrol—the rustle of Gore-Tex, the quiet click of a magazine being seated, the low murmur of Jurić’s voice giving last-minute instructions. He would lie in his bunk, feigning sleep, listening to their boots crunch on the gravel outside as they left him behind. The feeling of being left was a physical ache, a phantom limb of purpose that had been amputated.

The base command, in a clumsy attempt to keep him occupied, assigned him a rotating series of menial tasks. He inventoried medical supplies in the infirmary, his hands stacking boxes of bandages and IV bags that he might one day need but could not help deliver. He assisted the motor pool mechanics, his calloused hands, once a source of pride, now slicked with grease as he sorted bolts and cleaned engine parts. The other soldiers on the base treated him with a careful, almost fearful courtesy. They saw him as a curiosity, a lightning rod, the man the snipers were hunting. Their pity was a constant, low-grade humiliation, and he found himself longing for the honest, open scorn Sergeant Vuko had once heaped upon him. At least that had been a challenge, a thing to be overcome. This was a slow, gentle suffocation.

His only anchor in this sea of impotence was Kos. The sniper had transformed. He became a creature of pure, monastic focus, his already quiet nature distilling into an almost absolute silence. He ate alone, his eyes scanning maps of their patrol sector that were spread out beside his plate. He spent hours in the armory, not just cleaning his weapon, but seeming to commune with it, his long, pale fingers disassembling and reassembling the complex mechanism with the reverence of a priest preparing the Eucharist. He spoke to no one, but he and Luka had developed their own silent language. When Kos returned from a patrol, he would walk past Luka’s bunk and leave a small, natural object on his pillow—a unique pinecone, a piece of birch bark with a strange pattern, a oddly shaped stone. It was his report from the field, a physical piece of the terrain he was hunting, a constant, tangible reminder to Luka: *I was here. I am looking.*

The long, empty hours were a breeding ground for the ghosts of his past. The voice of Kiko, the inner cynic, grew louder in the quiet, whispering its poison. *See? A prisoner again. You just traded a fancy cage for a cheap one. You’re a mascot, a tragic story they tell over drinks. The rich boy who played soldier and got in over his head. Give up. Go home.* The temptation was immense. He could walk into the commander’s office, declare himself psychologically unfit, and be on a plane back to a world of anonymous luxury within a week. But every time the thought took root, the image of Kos’s silent dedication, of Jurić’s furious loyalty, of Marko’s simple, solid friendship, would rise to meet it. He had earned their respect. He would not betray it by succumbing to his own weakness. He could not fight beside them, but he would not abandon them in spirit.

He began to fight his own war. He could not carry a rifle, so he armed himself with information. He started spending his off-duty hours in the cramped intelligence section, initially just to be out of the barracks. He read every after-action report, every scrap of signal intelligence, every topographical analysis of their sector. He committed the landscape to memory, not as a soldier would, but as an architect might, learning its lines, its weaknesses, its hidden symmetries. He was looking for a pattern, not in the enemy’s tactics, but in their personality. The shots, the messages—they were not random. They were a form of communication, a cruel art form. The sniper was not just trying to kill; he was trying to tell a story. Luka, who had spent his life surrounded by the hollow theatrics of the ultra-rich, felt a grim, intuitive understanding of his opponent’s mindset. This was a performance.

One evening, he was studying a large satellite map of the border when Kos entered the room, back from a long, fruitless patrol. The sniper stood behind him, looking over his shoulder at the map. Luka, without turning, pointed to a specific grid square. It was a small, ruined chapel on a low hill, deep inside their patrol zone, a place of no tactical significance. “He likes an audience,” Luka murmured, his voice low. “He doesn’t just want to shoot me. He wants me to know he’s shooting me. It’s about the narrative. He shot me from a hidden position. The next shot will be from somewhere meaningful. Somewhere with history. Somewhere… poetic.” He tapped the icon of the ruined chapel. “He’ll be there. Not because it’s the best position, but because it’s the best stage.” Kos stared at the map, his gaunt face illuminated by the screen’s glow. He didn’t reply, but a new, dangerous light flickered in his dark eyes. He understood. Luka was not just reading a map; he was reading the enemy’s soul.

The next day, Luka sought out Captain Novak. He found her in her sterile office, a queen on a throne of classified data. He laid his theory out for her, not as a soldier, but as a profiler, speaking of narrative, psychology, and performance art. He argued that the enemy sniper was an egotist, a sadist who craved an intellectual engagement with his victim before the kill. Novak listened, her expression unreadable, her fingers steepled before her lips. When he was finished, she was silent for a long moment. “You’re suggesting we set a trap,” she said, her voice flat. “A trap for a ghost, based on your literary analysis of his personality.” “I’m suggesting,” Luka countered, his voice steady, “that we give the artist a canvas. We need to lure him into a predictable position. We need to make him think he’s in control of the story.” Novak leaned forward, a spark of her old, calculating energy returning. “And how do we do that? What bait do we use?” Luka met her gaze, his own eyes as cold and clear as the Lithuanian sky. “Me,” he said. “It’s always been me. But this time, he won’t be the only one watching.”The silence in the secure container following Luka’s proposal was so absolute it felt like a vacuum, sucking the very air from the room. Jurić, who had been a statue of coiled fury, visibly flinched as if Luka had just confessed to treason. Captain Novak’s mask of cool professionalism finally cracked, her eyebrows raising a fraction of an inch in undisguised surprise. The plan was audacious, borderline suicidal, and it hung in the air between them, shimmering with a terrible, brilliant logic. To hunt a performer, you must first build him a stage.

Jurić was the first to find his voice, and when he did, it was a low, guttural sound of pure disbelief, the growl of a wolf seeing one of its pups volunteer to walk into a snare. “No,” he stated, the single word an iron door slamming shut. He took a half-step forward, placing himself slightly in front of Luka, a human shield against the madness of the proposal. “Absolutely not. We are not sacrificing a man. We are not dangling one of my soldiers like a piece of meat on a hook to see if the monster bites. He is a rifleman, not a goat tied to a stake. The plan is to get him out, not send him further in.”

“The plan,” Novak countered, her voice regaining its sharp, analytical edge as she recovered from her surprise, “is to neutralize a high-value enemy asset who has demonstrated a unique and dangerous capability to penetrate our operational security. This isn’t about sacrificing a man, Corporal. It’s about using a unique opportunity. Private Volarić has, through no fault of his own, become the key to unlocking this problem. His analysis,” she gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod of respect toward Luka, “is the most credible piece of intelligence we have on this operative’s psychology. To ignore it would be dereliction of duty.”

“Duty?” Jurić laughed, a short, ugly bark devoid of all humor. “My duty is to bring my men home. Your duty is to play chess with human pieces from a warm room a thousand kilometers away. If you want bait, Captain, put on a uniform and go sit on that hill yourself.” The insult was blatant, a raw and insubordinate challenge. Novak’s eyes hardened, but before she could retort, Luka spoke, his voice quiet but carrying an undeniable weight that cut through the escalating tension.

“It’s my name he used, Corporal,” Luka said, looking at Jurić’s rigid back. “My past he’s using as a weapon. This isn’t your fight to protect me from. It’s my fight to win.” He stepped out from behind Jurić’s protective stance, placing himself back in the center of the room, meeting the Corporal’s furious, pained gaze. “You and Kos and the rest of the squad have been covering my flank, and I am grateful for it. But this enemy isn’t on my flank. He’s in my head. The only way to beat him is to get in his. I have to do this.”

The final decision rested with the NATO colonel, who had remained silent throughout the exchange, his face an unreadable mask of authority, his eyes moving between the three poles of the argument: Jurić’s raw-hearted protection, Novak’s cold-blooded opportunity, and Luka’s resolute agency. He steepled his fingers, staring at the map on the wall where the ruined chapel was marked with a small, insignificant icon. After a silence that stretched for an eternity, he spoke, his voice calm and decisive. “The risk is extreme,” he stated, his gaze falling on Luka. “But the potential gain is strategic. Captain Novak, you will plan this operation. But Corporal Jurić,” the colonel’s eyes swiveled to the corporal, “you will have absolute veto power on the tactical execution. If at any point you deem the risk to your men unacceptable, you are authorized to abort. This will be a counter-sniper operation with an intelligence-gathering component, not the other way around. Private Volarić is your bait, but Kos is your hook, and your squad, Jurić, is the line. Do not let it break.”

The planning that followed was a quiet, intense ballet of two disciplines. Novak and her team worked on the electronic side, preparing a suite of sensors to be placed around the chapel, designing a communication network that was hardened against intrusion, and coordinating air support to be on standby miles away, unseen but available. The other side of the planning took place in a small, bare room between just two men: Luka and Kos. They sat at a table, a large, detailed topographical map spread between them, the ruined chapel at its center. This was no longer a conversation between a soldier and a sniper, but between two grandmasters of observation, two artists of the unseen. Kos, with his almost preternatural understanding of ballistics and terrain, spoke in a hushed whisper of wind patterns, of thermal shadows, of the way the morning light would hit the chapel’s broken bell tower. He pointed out the two most likely firing positions the enemy would choose, not the most concealed, but the most arrogant, the ones with the clearest, most dominant view.

Luka, in turn, spoke of narrative. “He won’t shoot right away,” he murmured, tracing a line on the map. “He’ll want me to know he’s there first. He’ll want me to be afraid. He’ll send a message, or fire a ranging shot to let me know he’s watching. He’s a performer. The shot itself is the finale, not the opening act.” Kos listened, his gaunt face impassive, but his dark eyes absorbed every word. They were a strange, perfectly matched pair: the man who understood the enemy’s mind, and the man who understood his rifle. Together, they scripted a tragedy, casting the enemy sniper as the lead, meticulously designing the stage on which he would perform his final act, never realizing that the audience was armed and the applause would be the single, deafening report of Kos’s rifle.

While they planned, Jurić prepared for failure. He was a man possessed, a dark storm of furious energy. He drilled the rest of the squad relentlessly, running them through extraction scenarios under simulated fire until they could perform the complex sequence of movements in their sleep. He was preparing them to run into a kill zone and pull out a body. His anger was a shield, his professionalism a sword. He barely spoke to Luka, his silence a heavy blanket of disapproval and fear. But one evening, as Luka was walking back from his planning session with Kos, Jurić stopped him. He didn’t say a word. He just held out a small, custom-molded earpiece. “This is a direct, point-to-point radio, line-of-sight only. It’s not on the network. Novak doesn’t know about it. Kos will have the other one,” he said, his voice a low growl. “When you’re out there, I want his voice to be the only one in your head besides your own. Trust him. He will not miss.” It was the closest he could come to giving his blessing.

The morning of the operation dawned cold and achingly clear. The sky was a pale, washed-out blue, the air so still it felt as though the world was holding its breath. In the pre-dawn gloom, Luka dressed in silence, his movements slow and deliberate. He did not put on the white winter camouflage. At Kos’s suggestion, he wore the standard green and brown fatigues, a dark, conspicuous shape against the snow-covered landscape. He was not trying to hide. He was the centerpiece. As he did a final check of his gear—a rifle with a single, empty magazine, a canteen of water, the slate, and the small, secret earpiece from Jurić—he caught his reflection in the dark, inactive screen of a computer monitor. He saw a man with a lean, hard face and weary eyes, a soldier preparing for a battle. He saw the last ghost of the boy from Savska Street, a faint, haunted look of disbelief in the back of his eyes. He saw both men, finally integrated, finally at peace with one another, marching toward a shared, uncertain destiny.

As he walked out of the barracks, the entire squad was there, lining the path, their faces grim in the half-light. They did not speak. They did not wish him luck. They simply stood, a silent, solid wall of support, their presence a powerful, unspoken vow. Jurić was the last one he passed. The corporal just looked at him, his face a conflict of rage, fear, and a deep, grudging respect. He gave a single, sharp nod, the same nod Sergeant Vuko had given him on the parade ground. It was an acknowledgment. A farewell. A command. Luka returned the nod, turned, and began the long, lonely walk out of the base and into the pale, waiting light. He was the bait, walking willingly towards the trap, but he was also the hunter, leading a ghost to his final judgment. The stage was set. The audience was waiting. The silence was absolute.The walk was a pilgrimage into a vast, white desert. Luka moved as a single dark flaw in a world of absolute purity, his green-brown uniform a stark wound against the snow. The silence was a physical presence, broken only by the rhythmic, percussive crunch of his boots on the frozen crust of the ground. He did not look back. He knew that from a dozen hidden positions, his squad was watching his slow progress, their binoculars and rifle scopes tracking his every step. He knew that miles away, analysts were watching sensor feeds, and that somewhere in the cold, still air, a NATO reconnaissance aircraft was a silent, unseen god in the stratosphere. But most of all, he knew that one specific pair of eyes was watching him, and it was for them, and them alone, that he now performed. He kept his pace steady, his shoulders slightly slumped, affecting a weariness that was not entirely false, the posture of a man alone and lost in thought, a man whose guard was down.

The ruined chapel stood on its low hill like a broken tooth against the pale sky. Its stone walls were blackened with age and weather, sections having crumbled away to reveal the empty space within. The roof was long gone, and the small bell tower, a skeletal square of stone, stood open to the wind. It was a place of ghosts and forgotten prayers, a perfect stage for a drama of pride and death. Luka did not approach it cautiously. He walked up the gentle slope as if seeking shelter from the wind, a man drawn to the only vertical structure in a horizontal world. He entered through a collapsed section of the wall, his boots scuffing on fallen stone, the sounds echoing slightly in the enclosed space. The wind whistled through the empty window frames, a low, mournful choir.

Inside, he performed the small, choreographed actions of a careless soldier. He leaned his rifle, its magazine conspicuously empty, against the cold stone of what was once an altar. He pulled out his canteen, unscrewed the cap with slightly stiff fingers, and took a long, slow drink of the frigid water. Then, he raised his binoculars, not to scan for threats, but to gaze out at the landscape with the unfocused air of a tourist, his back partially exposed to the bell tower Kos had identified as the most likely, most arrogant, firing position. He was a study in vulnerability, a masterpiece of bait. He waited, his entire body a single, taut nerve, listening for the sound of the world ending.

A soft hiss of static in his right ear, so faint it was almost subliminal, made him flinch. Then came the voice, a ghost of a whisper, a sound that seemed to originate from inside his own skull. It was Kos. “In position. I see you, Luka. You look cold.” The use of his first name was a small, calculated breach of protocol, a thread of human connection in the sterile tension of the moment. “Wind is negligible. Air pressure is stable. It’s a perfect day for a long shot.” The calm, technical litany was more reassuring than any word of comfort. Luka was not alone. His guardian angel was watching through a high-powered scope, a ghost of vengeance waiting in a nest of snow and pine boughs a kilometer away.

Luka lowered his binoculars, continuing the performance, and as he did, the slate in his pouch vibrated, a silent, deadly tremor against his chest. He knew what it was. He pulled it out, his movements deliberately slow. The screen glowed with its familiar green text, the words forming with a casual, cruel elegance. This was the final monologue.

*Did you come here to pray, little rich boy? Tell your God I’ll be sending you to him shortly.*

As he read the words, Luka executed his final, rehearsed piece of stagecraft. His hand jerked as if in a spasm of pure terror, and the metal canteen slipped from his grasp. It hit the stone floor with a loud, clattering echo that seemed to shatter the profound silence of the chapel. He stumbled back a step, his eyes wide, staring at the screen, playing the part of the broken, terrified victim. He was giving the performer his climax, the moment of absolute psychological dominance he craved. He could almost feel the enemy sniper’s satisfaction, a smug, triumphant smile from a man who believed he had just authored the perfect end to his story.

The voice in his ear was as cold and sharp as an icicle. “He took it,” Kos whispered. “The message, your reaction. He thinks he has you. He’s in the bell tower, south-facing window. I see the glint of his scope. He’s settling in, getting comfortable. He’s enjoying this. Stay down. Let him enjoy it.” Luka crouched behind the low, crumbling wall of the altar, making his posture one of cowering fear. He was now hidden from the sniper, a move that would force his opponent to wait for him to re-emerge, to give him a clean shot. He was handing the sniper the final, fatal gift: patience that would allow Kos the time he needed.

The minutes stretched into an eternity. Luka focused on his breathing, slowing it down, just as he did on the range. The fear was a living thing inside him, but he contained it, walled it off. He was no longer a man; he was a component in a machine of death, a single, vital piece waiting for the mechanism to turn. “He’s shifting,” Kos’s voice murmured, a running commentary from another world. “Adjusting his bipod. He’s taking his time. He wants a perfect shot. Head or heart. The artist is choosing his canvas.” Luka closed his eyes. He thought of his father, of Maja, of the empty penthouse. They were faint, faded photographs from a stranger’s life. Then he thought of Jurić’s face, of Marko’s hand on his shoulder, of Kos’s silent, steady presence. This was real. This mattered.

“He’s on the gun,” Kos whispered, his voice losing its dispassionate edge, tightening with a hunter’s focus. “I see his breath misting around the scope. He’s getting ready. He thinks you’re going to peek over the wall. Don’t.” A pause. The world held its breath. “Luka. I have him.” The two words were a benediction, an absolution. “My shot is away.” In the same microsecond that Kos spoke, a deafening, whip-crack explosion tore through the air from the hills to the east. It was a sound of incredible, violent power, the sound of physics being bent to a man’s will. An instant later, a sharp, angry *zing* passed over Luka’s head with the sound of a furious insect, and a chip of stone exploded from the wall behind him. The enemy’s bullet, fired a split-second after Kos’s, had arrived a split-second too late.

The ringing in Luka’s ears was absolute. The sudden, shocking violence was replaced by a silence even more profound than before. He stayed crouched behind the altar, his heart hammering a wild, frantic rhythm against his ribs. He was alive. He was shaking, a deep, uncontrollable tremor seizing his entire body as the adrenaline began its slow, painful retreat. Then the voice returned to his ear, no longer a whisper, but a flat, calm, and utterly final statement of fact. “Target down,” Kos said. “The show is over.” Luka slowly, carefully, pushed himself up. He looked out through a gap in the wall towards the distant, skeletal bell tower. He saw nothing. The artist was gone. The stage was empty. He had walked into the valley of the shadow of death, and his brothers had walked with him.
