The email arrived with the digital equivalent of a cheap trumpet fanfare. Its subject line, a blaze of capital letters in a font called ‘Showbiz’, screamed: YOU’RE IN THE FINAL! Elara Vane read it three times. The first time, her heart performed a frantic little pitter-pat that was entirely out of sync with the serene rhythms she usually cultivated. The second time, a slow, disbelieving smile stretched across her face, feeling unfamiliar and wide. The third time, she pushed her chair back from the rickety desk, stood up, and walked to the bay window of her top-floor flat.

Below, Clifton stretched out in the soft grey light of a Tuesday morning. Double-decker buses wheezed their way up the hill, their red paint a slash of defiant colour against the pale Bath stone of the townhouses. A courier on a bicycle, weaving through traffic with a suicidal grace, was a fleeting kinetic poem. Elara closed her eyes, not to shut the world out, but to feel it more keenly. The thrumming life of the city was a constant, a low-grade Force signature she had long ago learned to filter into background noise. But now, she let it in. She felt the anxious pulse of a student late for a lecture, the weary contentment of an old man on a park bench, the sudden, sharp joy of a child spotting a dog. And beneath it all, her own delight, a clear, high, silvery note that harmonised with the whole chaotic symphony. A single tear traced a path through the faint dusting of flour on her cheek from her breakfast toast.

The West Country’s Calling. It was, by any galactic standard, a ridiculous competition. Last year’s winner had been a farmer from Somerset who could play ‘Greensleeves’ on a series of differently-sized cider bottles. The runner-up was a troupe of synchronised Morris dancers from Yeovil. And now her, Elara Vane, with her ‘Anomalous Kinetic Art’. That’s what she’d called it in the application. It was the most sterile, un-Jedi-like phrase she could conjure. She couldn’t very well have written ‘manipulating the fundamental energy field of the universe to make spoons float’. The producers, a man with a comb-over and a woman with an alarming amount of turquoise jewellery, had loved it. They’d looked at her with the hungry eyes of people who’ve seen too many tone-deaf singers and not enough genuine weirdness.

Her audition felt like a lifetime ago. In a stuffy community hall in Bedminster, under flickering fluorescent lights that hummed with a migraine-inducing frequency, she had taken a deep, centering breath. The Force wasn't strong in that place. It was thin and reedy, choked by cynicism and the faint smell of stale biscuits. But she had gathered it anyway. She’d reached out, not with her hands, but with that other, deeper part of her. She’d found the quiet, inanimate will of the objects on the table: a metal fork, a ceramic mug, a paperback copy of a popular thriller left behind by a previous auditioner. Gently, she had coaxed them. The fork rose first, wobbling like a nervous fledgling, before steadying and executing a slow, perfect pirouette. The mug lifted, tilting as if to pour an invisible drink. The book opened, its pages riffling as if in a sudden breeze.

The judges had been silent. The comb-over had flattened slightly, as if from the sheer pressure of disbelief. The turquoise jewellery had jangled as its owner leaned so far forward she nearly toppled out of her chair. “Magnets?” the man had finally croaked, his eyes scanning the ceiling for wires.

Elara had just smiled. “Focused intention,” she’d replied, the words feeling both true and hopelessly inadequate.

Now, she was in the final. The live, televised final, broadcast from the Bristol Hippodrome. A place of velvet seats and gilded plasterwork, a world away from the stale biscuit smell of the community hall. This was it. A chance to… what? To show off? No, that wasn’t it. Not really. It was a chance to be seen. To perform an act of pure, unadulterated truth in front of thousands of people, and have them accept it as entertainment. It was the most beautifully absurd compromise she could imagine for a life lived in the quiet margins between two realities. A Jedi in Clifton. It still sounded like the setup to a bad joke. A joke she’d been living for ten years, ever since the escape pod—a repurposed and highly illegal mining vessel—had crash-landed in a field just outside Chew Magna.

She pulled on her boots, the worn leather sighing in protest, and grabbed her coat. She needed to walk. The energy of the news was too much to be contained within the four walls of her flat, even with its high ceilings. Down the echoing, carpeted stairs she went, her footsteps lighter than usual. Outside, the air was damp and carried the faint, earthy scent of the Avon Gorge. She walked without a destination, letting the familiar streets guide her. She passed the bakery, where she sometimes used the Force to nudge the last almond croissant on the tray just a little closer to her side of the counter. She passed the little bookshop where she’d once stopped a cascading tower of hardbacks from flattening the owner’s cat with a subtle, invisible cushion of energy.

Her life was a tapestry of these tiny, secret interventions. A Jedi’s purpose, as she’d been taught in the creche on a world whose name was now just a smudge of painful memory, was to serve, to protect, to maintain balance. Here, in this peaceful, oblivious corner of a forgotten planet, there were no Sith to fight, no galactic senate to advise. But there was imbalance everywhere, in a thousand tiny forms. A wobbly café table that threatened to spill a young mother’s coffee. A child’s balloon slipping from its string, destined for a tearful flight into the grey sky. A driver, distracted by a text, about to pull out in front of a cyclist. Elara’s service was quiet, her protection unseen. She was the cosmic entity who tidied up the universe’s small, untidy edges. And no one ever knew. But in the final of The West Country’s Calling, they would see. They wouldn’t understand, but they would see. They would applaud. The thought sent another fizz of impossible joy through her.

Her walk eventually led her, as it often did, towards the suspension bridge, that great iron harp slung across the gorge. She leaned on the cool stone of the viewing platform, watching the cars shrink as they crossed. This was her place of meditation. The sheer drop, the vastness of the sky, the distant hum of the city – it all helped put her own small existence in perspective. She wasn't a master, not by a long shot. She was just a survivor, piecing together fragments of a life and a code she barely understood. Her own master, a stoic Togruta with a quiet wit, had perished in the chaos of their escape. Elara had been left with a head full of half-finished lessons and a heart full of grief.

"There you are. Knew I'd find you brooding up here."

The voice broke her reverie. She turned, a real smile blooming this time. Maya was approaching, her bright pink coat a beacon in the monochrome morning. Maya, with her sensible job in the council’s planning department and her complete and utter acceptance of Elara’s strange reality.

"I'm not brooding, I'm contemplating," Elara said, her tone light.

"Looks like brooding to me. Same face you make when you're trying to decide if a takeaway is a 'moral failing'," Maya teased, joining her at the wall. "So? I saw the email. They sent it to me too, as your 'official supporter'."

"They did?"

"Yep. All caps. Very tasteful. I almost had a seizure." Maya beamed, her whole face alight. "Eli, this is it! It's amazing! We have to celebrate. Bottle of prosecco tonight? My treat."

"I can't, May. I need to be clear. The final's the day after tomorrow." Elara’s mind was already on her routine. The sequence had to be flawless. The gentle lift, the slow rotation of the wine glasses, the cascade of the silver spoons, the final, climactic crescendo where a heavy antique chair would rise a full six feet from the stage. It required immense concentration.

"Oh, come on. One glass won't scramble your Force-y brain waves," Maya insisted, though without any real pressure. She understood. "Fine. But after you win, we're booking a table somewhere ridiculously expensive. So, what's the plan? More floating cutlery? Are you going to levitate one of the judges?"

"I think that might be breaking the rules," Elara laughed. "No, just the routine. But bigger. More… resonant."

"Well, you've got my vote. And my mum's. She's told the entire bridge club she knows a real-life witch."

"Please tell her I'm not a witch."

"I did. She said, 'Even better, dear!' and went back to her scone." Maya looped her arm through Elara’s. "Come on, let me buy you a coffee. You look like you're about to vibrate into another dimension. You need grounding."

"Coffee would be good," Elara admitted. The caffeine would be a jarring note in the harmony she was trying to build, but Maya’s presence was a grounding force all of its own. It was a solid, dependable warmth in a world of shimmering, uncertain energies.They found a small cafe tucked away in a warren of lanes behind the main street, its windows steamed up against the morning chill. Inside, the air was warm and thick with the scent of roasted coffee beans and toasted teacakes. It was a comfortable chaos of clinking ceramic, the hiss of the espresso machine, and the low murmur of a dozen conversations. For Elara, stepping inside was like submerging herself in a warm bath of human energy – messy, comforting, and utterly normal. They found a small, slightly wobbly table in the corner, and Maya went to the counter, navigating the cramped space with an ease Elara always admired.

Maya returned with two large mugs, setting one down in front of Elara. A perfect milky swirl sat atop the dark liquid. “One oat milk flat white, for the grounding of the Jedi,” she announced, sliding into her own chair. “And one full-fat-full-caffeine-give-it-to-me-now latte for your humble, non-magical supporter.” She took a sip, leaving a faint foam moustache on her upper lip. “Right. Practicalities. What are you going to wear? You can’t go on in your usual jeans-and-a-jumper combo. This is prime time, Eli. You need something… enigmatic.”

Elara looked down at her clothes as if seeing them for the first time. A dark green jumper, soft with age, and black jeans. Her standard uniform. “I hadn’t thought about it,” she confessed. “I was more focused on not accidentally levitating the host.” She wrapped her cold hands around the warmth of the mug. The collective life-force of the café was a pleasant hum. Here, she could almost forget the vast, silent emptiness between the stars. “I don’t want to be enigmatic. I just want to be… me. But a version of me that’s on television.”

“Which is the definition of enigmatic, you lovely weirdo,” Maya said, wiping her lip with a napkin. “We’ll go shopping tomorrow. Something simple. Dark colours. Maybe a bit of velvet to catch the light. You want them to focus on the floating stuff, not your fashion choices.” She leaned forward, her voice dropping slightly. “Have you thought about the routine? The big finish? Last year, the cider guy played the national anthem. It was dreadful, but people loved it. You need a finale that’ll make my mum drop her TV remote.”

“The chair,” Elara said quietly, her gaze fixed on the middle distance. “The big antique chair I bought at the flea market. It’s heavy. Dense. It has a… a history. It remembers things. It will be the anchor for the whole performance. Everything else—the glasses, the spoons, a few books—will be the prelude. The chair will be the crescendo.” Her focus was so intent that for a moment, the sugar shaker on their table trembled, its contents shifting like desert sand. She noticed and consciously relaxed, the shaker falling still.

Maya saw it. She didn't comment on the shaker itself, but her eyes softened with understanding. “Just be careful, Eli. It’s one thing doing it in a drafty hall in Bedminster. It’s another on live TV. Millions of camera phones, super-zoom, slow-motion replays. What if it looks too real? I know that’s the point, but… what if someone starts asking the wrong questions? Not ‘magnets?’, but questions you can’t answer with a cryptic smile.”

It was the fear she hadn't let herself fully articulate, the cold stone at the bottom of her bubbling delight. For ten years, her survival had depended on being invisible, on her abilities being dismissed as odd tricks or fortunate coincidences. This performance was the antithesis of that. It was a deliberate spectacle. “Let them ask,” Elara said, her voice firmer than she felt. “They'll explain it away themselves. They’ll say it’s a brilliant illusion. A world-class magician who’s been hiding her light under a bushel in Bristol. It’s a far more believable explanation than the truth, isn’t it?” She took a sip of her coffee. “An alien refugee who can move things with her mind. Who’s going to believe that?”

“Me,” Maya said simply, reaching across the wobbly table and squeezing Elara’s hand. “I believe it. And I’ll be in the front row, cheering so loud you’ll feel the vibrations. Just… try not to get abducted by government agents, okay? I’ve only just paid off my car, I can’t afford bail for an extraterrestrial.” The joke landed, and Elara felt the knot of tension in her chest loosen. She laughed, a genuine, free sound that made the man at the next table look up from his newspaper and smile. The symphony of the café seemed to swell, and for the first time that day, Elara’s own note of joy didn't feel like a solo. It was part of the chorus.They lingered in the warmth of the café for another hour, the conversation drifting from the terrifying precipice of the final to the comfortable plains of everyday life. Maya recounted a disastrous meeting about a new roundabout design, complete with impressions of the pompous senior councillors involved, and Elara found herself laughing until her sides ached. It was a potent antidote to the high-frequency anxiety that had been buzzing beneath her skin. This, she thought, was another form of balance. The cosmic and the mundane, the Force and the flat white, the galactic fugitive and the friend who griped about local bureaucracy. When they finally stepped back out into the grey afternoon, the world felt less like a tightrope and more like solid ground.

The following day was a whirlwind of Maya-mandated preparation. She vetoed Elara’s entire wardrobe with the cheerful ruthlessness of a seasoned general. They navigated the crowded pavements of the city centre, a mission Elara found more stressful than any asteroid field. In a boutique filled with the scent of scented candles and the quiet rustle of expensive fabrics, Maya found the dress. It was the colour of a night sky just after the sun has vanished, a deep, starless blue in soft velvet. When Elara tried it on, she didn't see herself, but a stranger. A performer. Someone mysterious and capable. “It’s not a costume, Eli,” Maya had said, her voice soft but firm as she adjusted the hang of the shoulder. “It’s armour. It says you’re serious, but it doesn’t scream for attention. It lets the magic be the focus.” Elara had to admit, it felt right. It felt like a deliberate choice, a statement of intent.

That evening, with the blue velvet dress hanging on her wardrobe door like a silent promise, Elara prepared. The flat was quiet, the usual city sounds muffled by a descending mist. In the centre of her living room, where she had painstakingly cleared a space, sat the antique chair. It was a heavy, dark wood thing with carved arms and faded damask upholstery, bought for twelve pounds and the effort of carrying it up four flights of stairs. She approached it not as a prop, but as a partner. Closing her eyes, she laid her hands on the worn, smooth wood of its arms. She didn't push or pull. She listened. The Force was a river, and the chair was a stone resting in its bed, saturated with the currents of time. Faint, ghostly impressions bloomed in her mind, not as images, but as pure feeling. The deep, settled comfort of an old man reading his paper by the fire for thirty years. A flash of sharp sorrow from a woman who had sat in it to weep after receiving bad news. The giddy, bouncing energy of children clambering on it, forbidden but joyful. The long, patient silence of decades spent in a dusty antique shop. It had absorbed a century of small, human moments. It was heavy with life, and tonight, she would ask it to fly.

She woke before her alarm, in the deep, pre-dawn stillness. The quality of the silence was different. The low-grade thrum of the city she was so accustomed to had a new, specific texture. It was as if a million tiny threads of awareness, previously scattered and unfocused, were slowly being drawn together, their destination the grand old theatre downtown. It was the collective anticipation of an audience, a faint but growing psychic hum that she could feel in her bones. Standing at her bay window, she looked out not at the familiar view of Clifton, but at a landscape of energy. The anxious pulses and weary contentments were still there, but now they were overlaid with a new layer of curiosity, of expectation. They were waiting for a show. They were waiting for her. A profound, terrifying, and exhilarating sense of connection washed over her. She was no longer a secret, a ghost in the machine of the city. She was about to become a story, and the opening chapter was only hours away.The backstage of the Bristol Hippodrome was a different kind of chaotic symphony. Where the city was a sprawling, organic composition, this was a frenzied, high-pitched clamour confined to narrow corridors and cramped dressing rooms. The air was thick with the competing smells of hairspray, sweat, and the dusty velvet of ancient stage curtains. A low, persistent hum emanated from the lighting rigs, a technological counterpoint to the nervous, human energy that saturated the space. Elara felt it as a frantic, discordant buzz in the Force, a thousand anxieties and ambitions all shouting at once. It was like trying to meditate in the middle of a droid factory during a shift change.

Their designated space was a corner of a large, communal green room, a cavern of faded glamour with peeling gilt mirrors and sofas that had absorbed the hopes and fears of generations of performers. Elara found herself sharing the area with the other finalists, a human menagerie that made a Jedi fugitive feel surprisingly normal. There was a trio of teenage girls in matching sequinned jackets who performed close-harmony sea shanties, their faces a mask of determined focus. A man in late middle age, dressed in full beekeeper attire, was anxiously murmuring to a glass case containing what he claimed was a "choir of harmonically-gifted bumblebees." In another corner, a woman was furiously polishing a collection of musical saws, the rasp of her cloth against the metal setting Elara’s teeth on edge.

“Right,” Maya said, dropping a heavy tote bag onto their allotted patch of worn-out carpet. She’d navigated the backstage labyrinth with the confidence of someone used to deciphering council zoning maps. “I’ve got water, emergency chocolate, and a copy of the council’s refuse collection schedule in case you get bored and want to read something truly mind-numbing to calm your nerves.” She surveyed the room, her eyes wide with undisguised glee. “Harmonic bees. He’s going to be tough to beat, Eli. The public loves a novelty animal act.”

Elara managed a weak smile, her hands clasped in her lap to stop them from trembling. The dark blue velvet dress felt both strange and reassuring against her skin. “I’m not trying to beat him, May. I’m just trying not to drop a chair on the host.” She could feel the presence of her props, waiting just off-stage in the wings. The chair, the glasses, the silver spoons. They felt like distant, sleeping friends, their inanimate patience a balm against the frantic energy of the room. She focused on their stillness, using it as a focal point to build a small bubble of calm around herself.

Her bubble was promptly burst by the arrival of the producers. Barry, the man with the comb-over, was sweating profusely under the hot lights, while Brenda’s turquoise jewellery seemed to have multiplied, clanking and jangling with her every effusive gesture. “Elara! Our star! Our magnificent mystery!” Brenda enthused, her voice a theatrical rasp. “You’re feeling good? You’re feeling the vibe? The energy out there is electric!” She gestured vaguely towards the stage, from which the muffled sound of a roaring crowd could be heard as the host warmed them up.

“We’ve put you in the prime spot, just before the final ad break. The big finale to the main event!” Barry added, leaning in conspiratorially. “We’re telling people you’re a recluse, a sort of artistic hermit from the hills of Clifton. Builds the mystique, you see.” He eyed her simple, elegant dress. “Perfect. Understated. It lets the… well, it lets the whatever-it-is speak for itself.” He clearly still had no idea what he was about to witness, and was all the more thrilled for it. His mind, as Elara felt it, was a frantic calculation of ratings and social media trends.

Once they had bustled off to harass the beekeeper, Maya let out a low whistle. “An artistic hermit? You live five minutes from a Waitrose.” She nudged Elara gently with her shoulder. “Don’t listen to them. They’re just background noise. You know what you have to do. Just like in your living room, but with a few more people watching.” She held out a small, square piece of chocolate. “Here. For courage.” Elara took it, the familiar taste a small, sweet anchor to reality. The sugar was a brief, sharp spike in her carefully cultivated equilibrium, but Maya’s steady, unwavering belief was a far more powerful stabilising force.

A young woman with a headset and a clipboard appeared at the edge of their space, her expression one of supreme, professional stress. “Elara Vane? Five minutes. We’re moving your props onto the stage now.” The words cut through the remaining haze of Elara’s nerves, sharpening her focus to a fine point. This was it. She stood up, smoothing the velvet of her dress. The background noise of the green room faded away, the cacophony of the building’s Force signature resolving itself into a single, immense presence: the audience. It was a vast, curious entity, a sea of a thousand minds, waiting to be shown something wonderful.

Maya walked with her to the edge of the stage, the cavernous, dark space known as the wings. Through the gaps in the curtains and equipment, Elara could see the glare of the lights and the host, a man with a relentlessly shiny suit, bringing the sea shanty trio’s performance to a close. The applause was a physical wave of sound and emotion that washed over her. “Okay, hermit,” Maya whispered, giving her arm a final, fierce squeeze. “Go be enigmatic.” Elara looked at her friend, at the unshakeable faith in her eyes, and felt a surge of warmth that had nothing to do with the Force. She nodded, took one deep, centering breath, and let it out slowly. She let go of the nervous girl in the flat, the fugitive, the orphan. She was a performer now. The clipboard woman gave her a nod. Elara stepped forward, out of the shadows and into a blinding universe of light.The light was a physical blow. Hot, white, and absolute, it scoured the world away, leaving her isolated in a brilliant circle on the vast, dark stage. For a heartbeat, she was blind, her senses overwhelmed. The roar of applause for the previous act faded into a vast, expectant hush, a silence so profound it felt louder than any noise. In that void, she could hear the frantic drumming of her own heart and the whisper of velvet against her skin. The collective mind of the audience was a tangible presence, a vast ocean of curiosity lapping at the edges of her awareness. It wasn't hostile, not yet. It was simply waiting, a thousand pairs of eyes focused on the strange, quiet woman in the circle of light.

The host, a man whose teeth seemed to generate their own light source, glided towards her. "And here we have her!" he boomed, his voice echoing slightly in the immense space. "Our final act of the night, the mystery from Clifton, Elara Vane! And her… Anomalous Kinetic Art." He gestured to the simple setup: a plain black table holding a few silver spoons and two elegant wine glasses, and standing a few feet away, the heavy, dark mass of the antique chair. He gave her a wink that was meant to be conspiratorial but felt deeply patronizing. "No smoke, no mirrors, she tells me. Let's see the magic, Elara." He retreated back into the shadows, leaving her utterly alone with the silent expectation of the nation.

Taking a slow, deep breath, Elara closed her eyes. She shut out the heat of the lights, the phantom presence of the cameras, the overwhelming psychic hum of the crowd. She reached past it all, searching for the familiar, quiet resonance of the objects on the stage. She found them, islands of stillness in the churning sea of human energy. She didn't command; she invited. Gently, she extended her will, a silent question posed to the nearest silver spoon. For a terrifying second, nothing happened. Then, with a slow, hesitant wobble, the spoon lifted from the black tablecloth. It rose a few inches, catching the light, a single drop of liquid mercury hanging in the air. A collective gasp, a ripple of whispers, washed through the auditorium.

The first success was a spark. Now, she fanned it into a flame. She drew the second spoon into the air, then the third, and the fourth. They rose to meet the first, no longer wobbling, but moving with a newfound confidence. They began to circle each other in a slow, hypnotic orbit, their polished surfaces trailing streaks of light. She widened her focus, calling to the wine glasses. They rose from the table with a sighing grace, tilting towards each other until their rims touched with a faint, perfect chime that sang through the silent theatre. The note, pure and clear, seemed to hang in the air long after it had faded. The spoons now wove intricate patterns around the floating glasses, a silent, silver ballet conducted by a motionless woman in a midnight blue dress. The murmurs in the audience had died completely. The energy was no longer skeptical. It was pure, unadulterated awe. She could feel their wonder as a warm, rising tide, buoying her up.

Then, she let it all go. The spoons and glasses descended as gracefully as they had risen, settling onto the table without a single clink, as if placed on a cushion of air. A beat of absolute silence. She turned her head, her gaze falling upon the final piece, the anchor of her performance: the old chair. This was the true test. This was not a spoon; it was heavy with wood and fabric and a century of human life. She gathered herself, drawing on the astonished energy of the audience, weaving it with her own. Her focus narrowed to a single, piercing point. She reached for the chair, for its deep, groaning memory of gravity, and she asked it to forget. A low creak of ancient wood was the only sound. A tremor ran through its carved legs. Then, slowly, impossibly, it began to rise.

It lifted not with a jerk, but with a slow, undeniable majesty. One inch, then six, then a foot. It ascended through the spotlight, its faded damask seat and dark, polished arms looking utterly, beautifully absurd. It rose until it was floating level with her shoulders, a solid, heavy piece of the past hanging weightless in the present. There were no wires. There was no trick. There was only the quiet woman and the floating chair, a tableau so fundamentally impossible it bypassed disbelief and went straight to wonder. She held it there, suspended in a perfect, breathtaking moment of truth. The history of the chair, the memory of the Jedi, the strange life of the girl from Chew Magna—it was all there, in that one impossible act.

With a long, slow exhale, she released her hold. The chair descended with the same dreamlike slowness, its legs touching the stage with the softest of whispers, a feather-light landing for a heavyweight. For a moment, the silence held, a collective, indrawn breath. Elara swayed, the effort washing through her in a wave of exhaustion and giddy release. Then, the silence shattered. A single person in the front row stood up, clapping wildly, and Elara saw it was Maya, her face a mess of joyful tears. Then another person stood, and another, until the entire Hippodrome was on its feet. A tidal wave of sound, of applause, of roaring delight, crashed over her. It wasn't the polite clapping of an impressed audience; it was the thunder of people who had seen something they would never forget. And through it all, Elara Vane simply stood in the light, a single tear of her own tracing a path through the faint dusting of stage powder on her cheek, and she smiled.## Chapter 2

The wall of noise followed her into the wings, a physical pressure at her back that only receded when a heavy velvet curtain swung shut, muffling the roar to a distant sea-swell. The sudden dimness and relative quiet were a shock. She stumbled, not from the uneven floorboards, but from a deep, cellular exhaustion that settled into her bones the moment the performance ended. It felt as though she had been holding up the sky and had only just let it go. Before she could fall, a flash of pink coat materialized out of the gloom and two strong arms wrapped around her. Maya held her tight, her own body thrumming with adrenaline and vicarious triumph.

“You did it,” Maya whispered, her voice thick with emotion, her breath warm against Elara’s ear. “Oh, my god, Eli. You actually did it.” She pulled back, her hands on Elara’s shoulders, her face streaked with mascara, her eyes shining with more brilliance than any of the stage lights. “That wasn’t just floating cutlery. That was… I don’t even have a word for it. It was like watching someone write a poem with gravity.” Elara could only lean against her friend’s steadying grip, a puppet whose strings had just been cut, the smile still fixed on her face but feeling fragile now, like a pane of thin glass.

The short journey from the wings to the green room felt like traversing a mile of alien terrain. The usual gruff indifference of the backstage crew, the men and women in black who moved with practiced efficiency in the shadows, had been replaced with a wide-eyed, slack-jawed awe. They didn’t bustle past her; they stopped and stared. They made way for her, pressing themselves against stacks of flight cases as if she might accidentally levitate them too. One of them, a grizzled man with a thick grey ponytail, caught her eye and simply shook his head in slow, profound disbelief. His thoughts, unlike the diffuse wonder of the audience, were sharp and analytical, a staccato rhythm of ‘how’ and ‘what’ that pricked at the edges of her exhausted mind. He had seen it from ten feet away, in the clear, unforgiving light. He knew it wasn't a trick.

When she and Maya re-entered the green room, the discordant energy had vanished. A strange, reverent silence had fallen. The sea shanty trio, their sequinned jackets looking suddenly garish and trivial, sat clustered on a sofa, their gazes fixed on her. The woman with the musical saws was holding one of her instruments, but her hands were still, her expression unreadable. Even the beekeeper had forgotten his harmonic insects; he stood by the glass case, his veil pushed back, his mouth slightly agape. Their own modest ambitions—to sing sweetly, to play an unusual instrument, to coax a tune from a swarm of bees—had been performed on a stage that she had just fundamentally rearranged. It wasn't envy in the air. It was a kind of respectful fear, the kind of stillness that falls in the presence of a natural phenomenon, like lightning striking a nearby tree.

The stillness was shattered by the arrival of Barry and Brenda, a whirlwind of cheap cologne, clanking turquoise, and manic energy. “There she is! There’s our winner!” Barry bellowed, his comb-over now a dishevelled wreck, as if he’d been tearing his hair out with delight. He was clutching his phone like a holy relic. “The lines are melting! The app has crashed twice! Hashtag-Floating-Chair is trending globally! Globally, Elara! Above a royal baby announcement!” Brenda swooped in, grabbing Elara’s hands in her own. Her skin was cold and clammy. “Forget the West Country, darling, the world is calling! We have to talk contracts. A national tour, a Vegas residency! Imagine what you could do with a proper budget! We could lift a car! An elephant!”

The words were a jarring cacophony. A car. An elephant. Vegas. They were trying to monetise a miracle, to package a fundamental truth of the universe into a ticketed event. She felt a wave of psychic nausea. The pure, silvery note of her own delight had been tarnished, coated in the greasy film of commerce. She felt Maya tense beside her, moving to form a protective barrier. “Give her a minute, Barry,” Maya said, her voice dangerously calm. “She’s just bent the laws of physics live on national television. She’s not ready to discuss merchandising rights.” Her deliberate use of that phrase made Barry blink, the frantic salesman in his eyes momentarily replaced by a flicker of the same awe she’d seen in the stagehand.

Elara sank onto the nearest sofa, the worn fabric sighing under her weight. The exhaustion was a physical weight now, pressing her down. On the large television mounted to the wall, the shiny-suited host was on screen, his professional smile strained with genuine shock. “An incredible, unforgettable performance from Elara Vane,” he was saying, his voice resonating with forced cheerfulness. “The phone lines are now closed. The votes have been counted and verified. After the break, we will crown the winner of The West Country’s Calling.” Elara stared at her own face on the screen, a still from the end of her act, the tear visible on her cheek. The artistic hermit. The magnificent mystery. She had wanted to be seen, but she had never considered what would happen next. Winning wasn’t the end of a competition anymore. It was the beginning of a life sentence in the spotlight, a cage gilded with applause.The commercial break was a strange, suspended moment in time. For three minutes, the future hung in the balance, and the green room became a pressure cooker of unspoken thoughts. Barry paced back and forth, dictating frantic, one-sided conversations into his phone about network exclusives and morning show appearances. Brenda attempted to engage Elara in a hushed but intense dialogue about sequins and pyrotechnics for a potential tour, her turquoise rings glinting with each emphatic hand gesture. Elara heard none of it. She was looking at the television, at the aggressively cheerful advertisements for washing powder and car insurance, and feeling a profound sense of disconnection. It was as if she were watching a broadcast from a different planet, one where people’s biggest concerns were stain removal and affordable premiums.

Maya remained a solid, immovable presence at her side, a human breakwater against the producers’ relentless tide. “She’ll call you,” she said firmly, cutting Brenda off mid-sentence about the feasibility of levitating a backup dancer. “When she’s ready. Right now, she needs to breathe.” The words were simple, but they carried an authority that made even the formidable Brenda take a half-step back, her painted-on smile faltering for a second. In that moment, Elara felt a surge of gratitude so powerful it almost brought her to tears again. She had faced the end of her world alone, but she wouldn’t have to face the beginning of this new one by herself. The Force could connect her to the universe, but Maya connected her to the world.

The clipboard woman reappeared, her face pale under the harsh fluorescent lights. “On stage, please. All finalists.” Her voice was quiet, almost hushed. She looked at Elara with the same mixture of awe and fear as the backstage crew. The other acts rose, a small, defeated-looking troupe. The beekeeper patted his glass case with a sigh. The sea shanty girls had lost their bright-eyed ambition, their sequins looking dull and sad. They were all walking back into the arena to witness a coronation they knew was inevitable. As Elara stood, the velvet of her dress felt heavy, like ceremonial robes she had never been trained to wear. She didn't feel like a winner. She felt like a specimen being led back to her display case.

The roar that greeted them as they stepped back into the light was even louder than before. It was a single, unified sound, a beast with a thousand throats all chanting one name. Hers. The host stood centre-stage, holding a golden envelope. He made a show of building the tension, announcing the runner-up with a dramatic pause. It was the beekeeper, who received a wave of warm, slightly condescending applause. He accepted his small silver trophy with a gracious nod, a look of genuine relief on his face at having lost. Then the host turned, his grin a slash of brilliant white in the glare. “But there can only be one winner,” he boomed. “The act that has captured the hearts, the minds, and the votes of the entire West Country… and, I think it’s safe to say, the world! The winner of The West Country’s Calling is… Elara Vane!”

Confetti cannons exploded, showering the stage in glittering gold and silver paper. The sound was a physical impact, and Elara flinched. The host lunged forward, thrusting a large, hideously ornate trophy into her hands. It was a stylised, polished bronze map of the West Country, mounted on a heavy marble base, its weight a sudden, jarring reality. Cameras swarmed in, their red lights blinking like predatory eyes. The host leaned in, shouting over the din, “Elara! An astonishing performance! How does it feel?” Elara stared at him, her mind a perfect blank. How did it feel? It felt like a trap springing. It felt like the end of her peace. She looked past him, into the screaming, adoring darkness, and saw Maya in the front row, no longer crying with joy, but watching her with an expression of sharp, fierce concern.

Elara leaned into the microphone, the metallic scent of it filling her nostrils. The crowd quieted, desperate to hear the hermit speak. "I just…" she began, her voice barely a whisper, yet it carried through the theatre’s perfect acoustics. "I wanted to share something that was true." The words were hopelessly inadequate, yet they were all she had. They landed in the charged atmosphere with a strange resonance. The host, momentarily stumped for a response, simply beamed and raised her arm, the bronze map heavy in her other hand. The crowd erupted once more. In the chaotic surge of energy, a new sensation pricked at the edges of Elara’s awareness. It was faint, buried under the overwhelming roar of the crowd and the flashing lights, but it was there: a single, cold point of focus. It wasn’t awe. It wasn’t wonder. It was clinical, sharp, and analytical. Someone, somewhere in the psychic maelstrom, was not applauding. They were observing.

The moment the broadcast cut to the credits, Maya was in motion. She appeared at the side of the stage like an avenging angel in a pink coat, shouldering past a frantic-looking Barry. “She’s done,” Maya announced to anyone who would listen. “No interviews, no photos. She’s leaving.” She took the ridiculous trophy from Elara’s numb grasp and handed it to the nearest stunned stagehand as if it were a dirty plate. She grabbed Elara’s arm, her grip firm and grounding. “Come on, Eli. Let’s go home.” They moved with a desperate speed, a two-woman commando unit executing an extraction. They pushed through a gauntlet of outstretched hands, flashing phones, and shouted questions. Barry and Brenda trailed in their wake, protesting, pleading, their voices swallowed by the general chaos. Maya navigated them through a maze of corridors, down a flight of echoing metal stairs, and out a side door marked ‘Fire Exit’, the alarm beginning to wail behind them as they burst out into the cool, damp Bristol night.

The sudden quiet of the back alley was as shocking as the noise had been. The air smelled of wet pavement and distant traffic. Elara leaned against the cold brick wall, dragging the air into her lungs. The wail of the fire alarm faded as the door was pulled shut from the inside. They were alone. “Well,” Maya said, her voice trembling slightly, a mixture of laughter and stress. “That’s one way to turn down a Vegas residency.” She looked at Elara, her friend’s face pale and shocked in the dim orange glow of a streetlamp. The majestic performer from an hour ago was gone, replaced by the familiar, lost-looking woman she had found brooding by the suspension bridge. “Are you okay?” Elara shook her head, not in negation, but in a gesture of utter bewilderment. “I don’t know what I am,” she whispered. Her life of quiet interventions, of nudging croissants and saving cats, felt like a dream from which she had just been violently awoken. The secret was out, screamed from a television screen, celebrated with confetti. And somewhere in the noise, something cold and ancient had heard her.## Chapter 3

The taxi ride back to Clifton was a journey through a silent, underwater world. The city lights, usually a familiar comfort, smeared into long, anxious streaks of colour against the rain-slicked windows. Elara sat pressed into the corner of the back seat, the cheap fabric of the upholstery a rough, grounding texture against her hands. She felt hollowed out, a bell that had been struck so hard it could now only hum with a painful, vibrating echo. Maya sat beside her, a tense, coiled spring of protective energy, her gaze flicking constantly to the driver’s rearview mirror, scanning for any sign of pursuit. But there were no flashing lights, no chasing cars, just the mundane late-night traffic of a city heading for sleep.

“I felt something,” Elara said, her voice so quiet it was almost lost beneath the rhythmic slap of the windscreen wipers. “At the end. When the host was holding up my arm.” Maya turned to her, her brow furrowed with concern. “You mean besides the overwhelming urge to vaporise that trophy with your mind?” Elara shook her head, her eyes fixed on the blurring streetscape. “No. It was… different. Underneath all the noise, the applause, all that wild, happy energy… there was something else. One single point. It was cold. And it wasn't just watching. It was… scanning.” The words felt strange in her mouth, like a language she hadn’t spoken in a decade. A language of threats and hunters. Maya’s attempt at a reassuring smile didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Probably just some government spod from GCHQ having his mind blown. They’re only down the road in Cheltenham. They’ll be trying to work out if you’re a national security risk or if they can weaponise you to float their tea trolleys.” The joke fell flat, landing with a dull thud in the tense silence of the cab.

The familiar curve of her street felt alien and exposed. Every shadow seemed to hold a figure, every parked car a silent observer. Maya paid the driver, her movements brisk and efficient, while Elara stood on the pavement, clutching her coat tight against a chill that had nothing to do with the night air. The climb up the four flights of echoing, carpeted stairs was the longest of her life. Each footstep sounded like a drumbeat announcing her position. She half-expected to find the door of her flat hanging off its hinges, her life ransacked by men in dark suits. But the door was closed, the familiar scuffs on its paintwork reassuringly intact. Inside, the flat was just as she had left it: quiet, still, a sanctuary. But the feeling of safety was gone. It felt like a stage set after the audience has left, the illusion of security stripped away, leaving only painted flats and props. She walked to the bay window and stared down at the street. It was empty. The city was settling, its energy signature quieting to a low, sleepy hum. For now.

“Right,” Maya said, breaking the silence as she kicked off her shoes and dropped her keys into the pottery bowl by the door. “First things first.” She pulled out her phone, her thumb hovering over the screen. “I know you don’t want to, but we have to see what we’re dealing with.” Elara tore her gaze from the window and watched as Maya tapped the screen. The small rectangle of light became a portal into the chaos they had just fled. Her face was everywhere. The clip of the chair, grainy and endlessly looped, played on a dozen different news sites. The BBC. The Guardian. The New York Times. A headline from a popular tabloid screamed: 'IS CLIFTON WOMAN A WITCH, AN ALIEN OR A FRAUD?' Below it, a blizzard of social media posts, a digital storm of memes, arguments, and feverish speculation. Theories ranged from hidden electromagnets and sophisticated holograms to collective hypnosis and, inevitably, extraterrestrial intervention. They weren't just discussing an act on a talent show; they were dissecting a tear in the fabric of their reality. And she was the one holding the needle.

As Maya scrolled, her expression growing more grim with each new headline, Elara closed her eyes, trying to find her centre. She needed to filter the noise, to rebuild the serene mental walls that had been so comprehensively shattered. She reached for the Force, not to move anything, but just to feel its steady, indifferent current. And then she felt it again. The needle. It was closer this time, a thin, sharp probe of pure, dispassionate intellect sliding through the background hum of the city. It wasn’t a human mind, not as she knew them. Human thoughts were messy, emotional, a chaotic blend of image and feeling. This was clean, cold, and structured, like a line of code executing a search query. It swept past her, a searchlight in the dark, and for a terrifying instant, it snagged on her presence. She felt an icy jolt, a sense of being seen not with eyes, but with a scalpel. She gasped, stumbling back a step, her hands flying to her head as if to block it out. The contact was broken as quickly as it came, but the violation lingered, a phantom touch on her very soul.

“Eli? What is it? What’s wrong?” Maya was at her side instantly, her phone discarded on the sofa, the digital chaos forgotten. Elara was breathing hard, her heart hammering against her ribs. The half-finished lessons from her Togruta master, buried for ten years under the gentle dust of a peaceful life, came rushing back with the force of a tidal wave. *A Jedi’s signature in the Force is a beacon,* he had told her, his voice a calm echo in the storm of her memory. *To the blind, it is nothing. But to those who can see, it is a star in a dark sky. You must learn to shield it, to bank the fire until it is no more than a dying ember.* She had never needed to. Here, there had been no one else who could see. Until now. “I have to go,” she said, the words coming out in a rush. “Now. I have to pack.” The shock on her face was gone, replaced by a cold, hard clarity she hadn’t felt since the day she’d scrambled into the escape pod. This was the instinct that had kept her alive.

“Go? Go where?” Maya demanded, grabbing her arm. “Eli, you’re in shock. We’re safe here. Just lock the door, turn off the phones, and in the morning…” Elara cut her off, her voice low and urgent, laced with a fear Maya had never heard before. “You don’t understand. That thing I felt, that cold focus? It’s not a government analyst in an office. It’s active. It’s searching. And it just found me. It knows where I am.” She pulled away, her mind racing, cataloguing the few things she would need. A change of clothes. The small emergency credit chip she kept taped to the back of a picture frame. The tiny, palm-sized holoprojector that held the only image she had of her homeworld. "They're not looking for a TV personality, May," she said, her back to her friend as she began to move with purpose through the flat. "People like that, they don't care about fame or money. They're looking for an anomaly. A power source. A weapon. I can't stay here. I've made you a target just by being your friend."

As the words left her mouth, a sudden, profound silence descended. The hum of the refrigerator, the low buzz of the clock, the faint electronic whine of the router in the corner—it all ceased at once. The light from the lamp flickered and died, plunging the flat into a darkness broken only by the faint orange glow of the streetlights below. It wasn't a neighbourhood blackout; the lights in the townhouses across the street were still on. It was just her. Just the flat. A surgical cut. Elara froze, her hand halfway to a drawer. Maya let out a small, frightened gasp. Slowly, as one, they turned to the bay window. Below, in the empty, silent street, a dark panel van had pulled up to the kerb directly opposite her building. Its engine was off. Its windows were tinted, reflecting the streetlights like blank, obsidian eyes. It wasn't moving. It was just sitting there. Waiting. The cold, analytical presence wasn't a distant probe anymore. It was outside.## Chapter 4

The silence in the flat was absolute, a heavy, suffocating blanket that smothered all sound. Even the faint, ever-present hum of the city beyond the glass seemed to have been erased. The dark van sat below like a block of carved night, a void in the street that drew all light and hope into it. For a long, frozen moment, they were statues in the gloom, Elara and Maya, two figures silhouetted against the dim orange glow of the outside world. The cold, analytical presence wasn't just a point of focus anymore; it was a pressure, a physical weight against the walls of the flat, against Elara’s mind. It was the feeling of a predator’s patient gaze just before the pounce.

“Get back,” Elara’s voice was a low, harsh whisper, snapping Maya out of her terrified paralysis. She grabbed her friend’s arm and pulled her away from the window, into the deeper shadows of the living room. The Jedi training that had lain dormant for a decade was now fully awake, a cold fire in her gut, burning away the last vestiges of the performer and the hermit. The instincts that had guided her through the chaos of a collapsing starship, that had kept her alive in the wilderness of an alien world, were screaming at her. This was a trap. The power cut was the first move, isolating the target. The van was the cage, blocking the exit. The next move would be the slow, quiet ascent up the stairs.

“What are they?” Maya breathed, her eyes wide in the darkness, her voice trembling. “The police? MI5?” Elara shook her head, her senses stretched taut. She could feel the subtle shift in the building’s energy, the faint vibration through the floorboards. They were on the stairs now. Not a clumsy stomp, but a quiet, coordinated tread. Two of them, maybe three, moving with a fluid, professional economy that was far more terrifying than a battering ram. “They’re not from here,” Elara said, the certainty of it settling like a stone in her stomach. “Their minds… they’re too quiet. Too disciplined. It’s like listening to a machine.” Her gaze darted around the room, no longer seeing a home but an enclosure, assessing angles, exits, and weaknesses. The front door was a death sentence. The bay window offered a four-story drop to the pavement.

Her eyes fell on the smaller window in the kitchen alcove at the back of the flat. It overlooked a narrow, dark chasm between buildings, leading down to the rubbish bins and a shared, walled-in garden space. Beyond that, a labyrinth of mews and cobbled alleys that snaked behind the grand townhouses. It was their only chance. “The back,” she said, her voice dropping to a near-inaudible whisper. “We have to go out the back. Now.” She moved with a sudden, silent urgency, pulling a protesting Maya with her. Maya stumbled, her brain struggling to catch up with the frantic shift from watching TV to a rooftop escape. “Out the back? Eli, it’s a sheer drop! Are you insane?” she hissed, her panic threatening to boil over.

Elara turned to face her in the cramped kitchen space, her hands gripping Maya’s shoulders. The quiet footsteps were on the landing below theirs now, impossibly soft. “Listen to me,” Elara commanded, her voice low and intense, channeling the last dregs of her master’s authority. “They are coming through that door in less than a minute. We can either be here when they do, or we can be on the roof. I can get us across. I can keep you safe. But you have to trust me. Completely.” She looked into Maya’s terrified eyes, pouring every ounce of her will, of her desperate plea for trust, into her gaze. Maya stared back, her chest heaving, and then, with a choked sob, she nodded. The trust was there, a flickering candle against a hurricane, but it was enough.

Working in near-total darkness, Elara unlatched the old sash window. It protested with a groan of damp, swollen wood. She froze, listening. The footsteps outside had stopped, directly in front of her door. They knew. They were waiting, perhaps listening for the very sound she had just made. With infinite, painstaking care, she pushed the window open just enough to squeeze through. A gust of cold, damp air carrying the scent of rain and moss filled the kitchen. “My coat,” Maya whispered, shivering. “Forget it,” Elara replied, already hoisting herself onto the narrow sill. “Material things don’t matter. Only living things.” She swung her legs out into the night air, her boots finding a precarious purchase on the narrow stone ledge that ran beneath the window. The drop was dizzying, a black maw that promised a swift end. She ignored it, her focus entirely on the rough, damp texture of the brickwork under her questing fingers. She flattened herself against the wall, turning back to Maya. “Your turn. Don’t look down. Look at me.”

With Elara’s hand gripping hers in a vice, Maya clambered awkwardly onto the sill, her breath coming in ragged, terrified gasps. She was shaking violently, her sensible office shoes slipping on the wet stone. “I can’t,” she whimpered, her eyes screwed shut. “You can,” Elara insisted, her voice a solid anchor in the terrifying void. “I have you.” She wrapped her will around Maya like a physical shield, a subtle cushion of the Force that steadied her friend’s trembling feet, that gave her a preternatural sense of balance she did not possess. Elara pointed upwards. “The fire escape from the flat below ends just there. We can reach it. Then up, to the roof.” Just as Maya found her footing on the ledge beside her, a soft, metallic click echoed from inside the flat. The sound of a lock being bypassed. They were out of time.The metallic click was a starting gun. All thought ceased, replaced by pure, cold instinct. Elara shoved Maya upwards, towards the rusted iron lattice of the fire escape that ended just above their heads. “Climb!” The word was not a request; it was a physical force in itself. Maya scrambled, her fingers finding the lowest rung, her office shoes scraping uselessly against the brick. Without hesitation, Elara placed a hand on the small of Maya’s back and *pushed*, not with muscle, but with a surge of kinetic energy that lifted her friend with impossible ease onto the escape’s platform. Elara followed in a single, fluid motion, her feet barely touching the rungs. They hadn’t taken two steps up the narrow stairs when a shape appeared in the window they had just vacated. It was tall and slender, clad in a material that seemed to drink the dim light, its face obscured by a smooth, featureless mask that reflected nothing. It tilted its head, a gesture not of confusion, but of recalibration, and then it flowed through the window and onto the ledge with the silent, boneless grace of a hunting cat.

“Up! Don’t look back!” Elara urged, pushing Maya ahead of her up the rattling metal staircase. The metal was slick with a fine mist, each step a potential disaster. Maya’s breath was a terrified sob in the night, but she kept moving, fueled by adrenaline and Elara’s relentless pressure. Elara risked a glance down. The masked figure was already ascending, its movements unnervingly efficient, pulling itself up not rung by rung, but in long, smooth hauls, covering distance at a rate that wasn't humanly possible. Behind it, a second figure emerged from the window, identical to the first. Their minds were blank sheets in the Force, their presence a void that was more terrifying than any raging emotion. They were not soldiers; they were instruments. Elara reached the top of the fire escape and vaulted over the railing onto the slippery, angled slate of the roof, immediately turning and hauling a half-sobbing Maya up after her. They were exposed, high above the sleeping city, on a treacherous battlefield of chimney stacks and slick, wet tile.

The rooftop stretched before them, a shadowy landscape under the bruised purple sky. Chimney pots stood like silent, watching sentinels. A tangle of aerials and satellite dishes formed a web of metallic obstacles. There was nowhere to go but across. The gap between her building and the next was a five-foot chasm of blackness, a straight drop to the hidden gardens below. For Maya, it was an impossible leap. For Elara, it was the only path. The first masked figure was already cresting the edge of the roof behind them. “Maya, run and jump when I tell you,” Elara commanded, her voice cutting through the rising panic. She positioned herself at the very edge of the slate roof, planting her feet. Maya took three stumbling steps, her eyes wide with terror as she looked at the gap. “I can’t!” she cried, skidding to a halt. The figure behind them raised its arm, and something glinted in the dim light. “NOW!” Elara yelled.

As Maya launched herself into the air with a desperate, hopeless scream, Elara’s hand shot out. She didn’t touch her friend. She reached for her with the Force, creating an invisible wave, a solid swell of energy that met Maya mid-air. It wasn’t a gentle lift; it was a brutal, urgent shove that propelled her across the gap. Maya landed on the far roof in a clumsy, sprawling heap, scraping her hands and knees on the rough gravel but safe. Elara followed a half-second later, landing as lightly as a falling leaf. Behind them, a high-pitched whine cut the air, and a section of the chimney stack near where they had been standing exploded, showering the rooftop with brick dust and razor-sharp fragments of clay. They hadn’t been trying to capture her. They had been trying to incapacitate her.

Scrambling behind the bulk of a large brick chimney, Elara pulled Maya in tight. Her friend was hyperventilating, her body shaking uncontrollably. “Breathe, May, breathe with me,” Elara whispered, trying to project a sense of calm she was far from feeling. She peered around the edge of their cover. The two figures stood on the opposite roof, their masked faces turned towards them. They did not seem frustrated or angry. They were simply recalculating, their cold, analytical minds processing the new data: the target was mobile, powerful, and protective of its companion. They made no move to jump. Instead, the first one raised its arm again, not towards Elara, but towards the sky. A low, resonant hum began to build, a sound that vibrated not in the air, but directly in the bones.

High above, a shape detached itself from the low-hanging clouds. It was a small, angular craft, matte black like the van, its running lights extinguished. It descended with an unnatural silence, its engines emitting only that bone-deep hum. It was a troop transport, small and brutally efficient, and it was positioning itself to cut off their escape. The game had changed. This wasn't just a pursuit anymore; it was a harvest. The life Elara had built, the quiet, secret tapestry of her existence in this forgotten corner of the galaxy, had not just been seen; it was being systematically dismantled and repossessed. Her chance to be seen had become a curse, drawing the one kind of attention a survivor could never afford. She looked at Maya’s terrified, tear-streaked face and felt a cold, hard resolve solidify within her. It was one thing to hunt her. It was another thing entirely to threaten her friend. The quiet Jedi from Clifton was gone. In her place was something far older and far more dangerous.The bone-deep hum of the descending craft was the sound of a closing cage. It settled over the rooftops of Clifton, a suffocating weight of advanced, alien technology pressing down on the ancient stone and slate. In that moment, something inside Elara Vane broke, or perhaps it was reforged. The quiet, contemplative Jedi who nudged croissants and maintained the universe’s tiny balances was a luxury she could no longer afford. Her master had taught her about the Living Force, about harmony and service. But he had also taught her, in lessons cut short by fire and death, about survival. He had taught her that a Jedi’s duty was to protect life. And Maya, shivering and terrified beside her, was life. She was the one precious, irreplaceable thing in this world that Elara had a duty to protect. The rage that rose in her was not the hot, selfish anger of the dark side, but a cold, clean, diamond-hard fury, the anger of a shield being struck.

“They want to cut us off on the roof,” Elara said, her voice devoid of fear, replaced by an unnerving, tactical calm. She pulled Maya deeper into the shadow of the chimney stack, away from the two silent figures on the opposite roof. “They think we’re trapped up here. We’re not. We’re going down.” She pointed over the rear edge of the roof, into the sheer black drop to the walled gardens below. Maya followed her gaze, and a fresh wave of terror washed over her face. “Eli, no, we can’t, we’ll die!” Elara grabbed the front of Maya’s jacket, forcing her friend to meet her intense gaze. “You will not die. I will not let you. But you are going to do exactly as I say. I am going to create a storm. When it hits, we run for that edge. You don’t hesitate, you just go. Understand?” Maya, caught between the certainty of the figures in front of her and the impossible command from her friend, could only give a jerky, terrified nod.

Closing her eyes for a fraction of a second, Elara cast her senses wide across the roofscape. She wasn’t looking for the quiet will of a spoon or the patient memory of a chair. She was looking for ammunition. She found it everywhere. A forest of old television aerials, forgotten since the advent of satellite. Heavy lead flashing around the base of chimneys. A tangle of discarded cables. A large, rusted satellite dish on a neighbouring roof. She reached for them all at once, not with a gentle coaxing, but with a raw, violent wrench. Metal shrieked in protest across a dozen rooftops. With a focused wave of her will, she tore them from their moorings. An entire ecosystem of forgotten metal lifted into the air, a chaotic, screeching flock of rusted junk. For a moment, it hung there, a dark constellation against the bruised sky. Then, she hurled it forward.

The storm of metal debris flew across the gap, not as a random spray, but as a focused barrage. The two figures reacted with inhuman speed, their limbs moving in a blur as they batted away twisted aerials and spinning sheets of lead. A satellite dish the size of a café table slammed into the one on the right, sending it staggering back a step. It was not enough to harm them, but it was enough to break their perfect, coordinated stillness. It was a moment of chaos, a visual and psychic roar of static that momentarily blinded them. The craft above paused its descent, its silent hum wavering as its occupants processed the unexpected, violent resistance. It was the only window they would get. “NOW!” Elara screamed, grabbing Maya’s hand and pulling her from behind the chimney. They sprinted across the slick, angled slate towards the rear edge of the roof.

They reached the precipice, the black void of the four-story drop opening at their feet. Maya froze, a strangled cry catching in her throat. There was no time for reassurance. Elara didn’t break stride. Still gripping Maya’s hand, she simply ran straight off the edge of the building, pulling her friend with her into the abyss. Maya’s scream was a raw, tearing sound, swallowed by the sudden rush of wind. The world became a vertiginous blur of dark brick and distant lights. The ground rushed up to meet them with lethal speed. Elara kept her eyes open, her focus absolute. She gathered the Force, not as a wave to push, but as a net to catch. She threw out a vast, invisible sheet of energy beneath them, a desperate, final brake.

The impact was not a gentle landing. It was a controlled crash. The Force cushion absorbed most of their momentum, but it buckled under the strain, and they slammed into the ground in a messy, painful heap, their fall broken by a row of large, plastic recycling bins. The bins exploded around them in a cacophony of shattering glass bottles, crushed cans, and splintering plastic. The sound was deafening in the narrow alley. Elara lay on the cold, wet flagstones, the wind knocked out of her, every muscle screaming in protest. The effort had been colossal, a massive, uncontrolled haemorrhage of energy that left her feeling dizzy and psychically frayed. Pain lanced up her leg from a twisted ankle, but she ignored it.

They were on the ground, in a dark, foul-smelling canyon between two towering Georgian houses. Maya was a few feet away, groaning, tangled in a sea of rubbish but seemingly in one piece. Bruised, scraped, terrified, but alive. Above them, the hum grew louder. A brilliant, white searchlight cut through the darkness, sweeping across the rooftops where they had just been. It sliced down, illuminating the alleyway, catching the steam rising from their breath. They were horrifically exposed. With a groan, Elara pushed herself up, her vision swimming. She crawled to Maya, grabbing her arm. “Get up,” she rasped, her voice raw. “Maya, we have to move. Get up!”

Hauling her friend to her feet, Elara shoved them both deeper into the darkness, away from the searching light. They stumbled into a warren of cobbled mews and narrow passages that served as the secret arteries for the grand houses. Their running was a frantic, clumsy flight, their footsteps echoing on the wet stones. They passed darkened kitchen windows and the high, unforgiving walls of private gardens. The hum of the craft tracked them from above, its light spearing down the narrow gaps, forcing them to duck and weave into ever deeper shadows. Finally, Elara saw it: a small, wrought-iron gate, half-hidden by an overgrown climbing rose, left slightly ajar. With the last of her strength, she pushed Maya through it and followed, pulling the gate shut behind them. They collapsed onto the damp earth of a forgotten corner of a large garden, hidden from the sky by the dense, dripping leaves of an ancient magnolia tree. They lay there, gasping for breath, listening as the hum of the search craft and its piercing white eye passed over them and moved on, continuing its hunt down the lane. For one fragile, precious moment, they were safe.The silence under the magnolia tree was deep and wet. It was the ancient quiet of damp earth and slow decay, a world away from the sterile, humming silence of the hunters. For a long minute, the only sounds were the ragged, desperate gasps for air from two pairs of lungs and the soft, rhythmic drip of water from the broad, waxy leaves onto the garden soil below. The searchlight had passed, its white spear of interrogation moving on, but the hum of the craft remained, a predatory thrum that seemed to have embedded itself in Elara’s bones. The adrenaline began to recede, leaving behind a cold, shaking exhaustion and a symphony of new pains.

“I think,” Maya wheezed, her voice a reedy whisper from the darkness beside Elara. “I think my left buttock has been impaled by a decorative garden hedgehog.” She shifted with a pained groan, followed by the clatter of a small terracotta object rolling away. The sheer absurdity of the statement, a fragment of her old life’s normality puncturing the bubble of their nightmare, almost made Elara laugh. It came out as a choked, half-sobbing sound. “Is it… is it broken?” Elara managed to ask, pushing herself up onto her elbows. The world tilted violently, and she fought back a wave of nausea. “The hedgehog or my buttock?” Maya asked, her voice gaining a sliver of its usual wryness, though it was stretched thin and brittle with shock. “Either way, I don’t think I’ll be sitting comfortably for a week.”

Elara crawled towards the sound of her friend’s voice. The pain in her ankle was a sharp, blinding fire, and she knew without looking that it was badly sprained, if not broken. “Let me see,” she said, her hands finding Maya’s arm in the dark. She ran her palms over her friend’s back, her legs, her head, not just checking for physical injury but feeling for the signature of her life force, the steady, familiar rhythm of Maya’s presence. It was frantic, terrified, and shot through with spikes of pain from a dozen scrapes and bruises, but it was whole. Unbroken. Relief washed over Elara, so potent it was dizzying. “You’re okay,” she whispered, more to herself than to Maya. “You’re okay.”

Maya finally sat up, pulling her knees to her chest, her body trembling in long, uncontrollable shudders. “Okay? Eli, you threw me off a roof! A building exploded! Silent masked ninjas and a bloody spaceship tried to abduct us! The word ‘okay’ has officially left the building.” Her voice cracked on the last word, and the fear she had been holding at bay finally broke through. “What were those things? Who were they?” Elara slumped back against the thick, gnarled trunk of the magnolia, the rough bark digging into her back. The effort of the escape, the massive, violent outpouring of the Force, had left her psychically hollowed out. Using the Force to float a spoon was like singing a lullaby; what she had just done was like screaming an entire opera in a single, sustained note. The cost was immense.

“They’re not from here,” Elara said, her voice flat with exhaustion. She had to make Maya understand. The time for secrets, for half-truths and vague allusions to ‘focused intention’, was over. “Ten years ago, I didn’t crash-land in an escape pod. I fled. My home… it was caught in a war. My Master and I got out, but our ship was hit. He died. I made it to the pod and the navicomputer picked the nearest habitable, unaligned world on the charts. A quiet, forgotten planet in the middle of nowhere. Here.” She took a shuddering breath, the memories she had so carefully walled off now flooding the broken landscape of her mind. “The people who started that war, who dismantled the Republic, they don’t like loose ends. They don’t like people with my… abilities to be unaccounted for. For ten years, I’ve been a ghost, a whisper. My power signature was so faint it wouldn’t register on any deep-space scan. But tonight…”

“Tonight you went on television and floated a chair,” Maya finished, the horror dawning in her voice. “You didn’t just become a whisper. You shouted. You set off a flare.” Elara nodded, the simple movement sending a throb of pain through her head. “A flare in a very dark sky. And they saw it. Those things… they’re not soldiers. They’re retrievers. Trackers. Their only job is to find people like me, contain them, and take them away. And they will not stop until they have me.” The finality in her voice hung in the damp air. This wasn’t a problem that could be solved by calling the police or hiring a lawyer. This was a force of nature, a galactic inevitability she had just invited to Maya’s doorstep. “I’m so sorry, May,” she whispered, the guilt a physical sickness in her gut. “I never should have… I put you in the heart of this.”

Maya was silent for a long moment. The only sound was the distant wail of a police siren, a sound from a world of understandable, manageable problems. “No,” Maya said finally, her voice surprisingly steady. “You didn’t. I pushed you. I was the one who said you should enter. I bought the prosecco. I helped you pick out the damn dress.” She reached out in the darkness and found Elara’s hand, her grip surprisingly strong. “We’re in this. Together. So stop apologising and start thinking like a Jedi. What’s the plan, hermit? Because lying here getting damp and contemplating the life choices of a garden hedgehog isn’t going to work for much longer.”

The fierce, irrational loyalty in Maya’s voice was the spark Elara needed. It cut through the fog of pain and exhaustion. A plan. She needed a plan. “We can’t stay here. We can’t use phones, credit cards, or any public transport with cameras. We need to get out of the city, find somewhere anonymous to hide and think. I have a credit chip. Old tech, untraceable. But we have to get to a place where I can access the funds without triggering alarms.” She forced herself to think tactically, to push past the throbbing pain in her ankle. “We need to get to the old part of the city. The docks. There are places there, people who deal in cash and don’t ask questions. It’s a long walk.” She tried to stand, putting weight on her injured ankle. A lance of white-hot agony shot up her leg and she collapsed back against the tree with a cry of pain.

Her ankle was useless. They weren’t walking anywhere. The hum of the craft was gone, but they were still trapped, pinned down by a simple, mundane injury. Despair, cold and sharp, threatened to overwhelm her. They had performed a miracle, a rooftop escape that defied physics, only to be defeated by a twisted ankle in a stranger’s garden. The irony was a bitter taste in her mouth. She was a Jedi, a wielder of the fundamental energies of the universe, and she was as helpless as a child.The despair was a cold, black water, rising fast. They were trapped, not by a technological cage, but by the simple, brutal reality of a human body’s frailty. All the power in the universe, the ability to bend the laws of physics to her will, was useless against a torn ligament and a swelling joint. Elara leaned her head back against the magnolia’s trunk, the rough bark a painful reminder of her own solid, breakable form. The path forward had been a desperate, narrow track, and now it had crumbled away into nothing.

It was Maya who broke the silence, her voice a fierce, shaky whisper in the dark. “No. Absolutely not. I did not get thrown off a roof and nearly get shish-kebabed by a garden gnome just for you to give up now.” She crawled over, ignoring her own aches, and knelt in front of Elara. “Your ankle is broken.” It wasn't a question. “Sprained. Badly,” Elara corrected, her voice thin. “It doesn’t matter. I can’t put any weight on it. We’re not walking to the docks, May.” “Who said anything about walking?” Maya’s council-planner brain, the part of her that saw problems not as disasters but as logistical challenges with inefficient solutions, was beginning to flicker back to life. Her eyes, now adjusted to the gloom, darted around the dark garden. “We’re in Clifton. Middle of the night. What do people in this city have in abundance, leave lying around in their front gardens, and never, ever lock up properly?”

Elara stared at her, uncomprehending. Her mind was on starships and galactic pursuers; she had no room for local trivia. Maya answered her own question. “Bicycles. We’re not walking. We’re cycling.” The plan was so audacious, so mundane, it was brilliant. Stealing bicycles. It was a crime so petty, so terrestrial, it felt like an act of defiance against the cold, silent hunters from the stars. Hope, faint but stubborn, began to push back against the despair. “I can’t pedal,” Elara pointed out, the grim reality of her injury anchoring them again. “You won’t have to,” Maya said, her mind already three steps ahead. “You’ll ride, I’ll push. Or I’ll ride, and you’ll sit on the back like a sack of enigmatic potatoes. We’ll figure it out. But first, we need to get you out of this garden.”

Getting Elara to her feet was an agonizing, clumsy process. Every movement sent a nauseating shockwave of pain up her leg. She clung to Maya, her arm slung over her friend’s shoulders, hopping on one foot like a wounded bird. They became a strange, lurching, four-legged creature, hobbling out of the sanctuary of the garden and back into the narrow, threatening alleys. Every shadow was a hiding place for a masked figure. Every gust of wind sounded like the whisper of a silent craft. Elara was a liability, a dead weight. The powerful protector from the rooftop was gone, replaced by a pale, sweating woman leaning heavily on her friend, her senses dulled by pain. Maya, in turn, transformed. The terrified passenger became the engine, her fear channelled into a fierce, determined strength as she bore Elara’s weight, her eyes scanning every corner, every doorway.

They found their prize in the front garden of a student house two streets away, a place identifiable by the pyramid of empty beer cans next to the overflowing recycling box. Two mountain bikes, battered and streaked with mud, were chained loosely to a wrought-iron railing. The lock was a cheap combination model, rusted from a hundred Bristol downpours. “Right,” Maya whispered, propping a grimacing Elara against the wall. “Leave this to me. I spent a year living with engineering students. I know the three most common combinations for lazy people.” She began to work the dials, her fingers surprisingly nimble. 1-2-3-4. Nothing. 0-0-0-0. Nothing. As she fiddled, Elara felt a subtle shift in the air, a prickle of awareness. Not the cold probe of the hunters, but a more common, terrestrial presence. A police car, cruising slowly up the main road a block away. Its low-level psychic signature—a mixture of boredom, weariness, and institutional suspicion—was unmistakable. They were about to be caught, not by an Imperial Inquisitor, but by a community support officer.

“May, hurry,” Elara hissed, the urgency cutting through her pain. “We don’t have time.” “I’m trying! It’s stuck!” Elara reached out a trembling hand, her fingers hovering inches from the lock. She was drained, her reserves of power almost non-existent. But she didn’t need to lift a chair. She just needed to nudge a pin. She closed her eyes, focusing past the fire in her ankle, past the fear, searching for the tiny, simple mechanism inside the lock. She found it, a series of small, greasy tumblers. With the faintest mental touch, a nudge no stronger than the one she used to use on croissants, she persuaded the last tumbler to click into place. The lock sprang open with a loud snap. Maya stared at it, then at Elara, her mouth open in a silent ‘oh’. “The combination was 1-9-8-4,” Elara lied weakly. “Classic.”

Their escape was a masterpiece of graceless desperation. Maya got on one bike, steadying it while Elara, with a pained grunt, swung her leg over the other. The plan was for Maya to hold onto Elara’s handlebars and essentially tow her, while Elara used her good leg to occasionally push off, steering as best she could. They wobbled out into the empty street, a strange, tandem contraption of two bikes and two terrified women. They moved in silence, the only sounds the clicking of their freewheels and the soft hiss of tires on wet tarmac. The descent from the heights of Clifton towards the harbour was a long, controlled fall. They coasted down the steep hills, the wind cold on their faces, the city lights spread out below them like a fallen constellation. For Elara, every bump and jolt was agony, but it was also progress. They were a moving target again, ghosts on stolen bicycles, slipping through the city’s sleeping veins.

The character of the city changed around them. The elegant, pale stone of Clifton gave way to the grittier brick of Hotwells. The air grew heavier, tasting of diesel fumes, damp rot, and the faint, briny promise of the river. They were entering the borderlands, a place of old warehouses, disused railway arches, and pubs that had seen centuries of sailors’ brawls. This was a world that understood secrets, a place where people knew how to become invisible. As they rounded a corner onto the harbourside, the view opened up. The water was a slick of black oil, reflecting the few remaining lights. The skeletal arms of the old cargo cranes stood against the sky, monuments to a forgotten industrial age. The hum was gone. The hunters were searching the affluent, well-lit heights, their logic telling them their quarry would seek refuge in comfort. They would not think to look here, in the city’s grubby, forgotten heart.

Maya pulled them to a halt under the dark arch of a railway bridge, the shadows thick and absolute. “This is it,” she said, her voice low. “The docks. Where to now, Captain?” Elara scanned the dark waterfront. She pointed with a trembling hand towards a row of old buildings huddled near the water’s edge. One of them had a single, grimy window lit by a dim, yellow bulb, a beacon of dubious welcome in the darkness. “There,” Elara said, her voice barely a whisper. “The ‘Thirsty Navigator’. It’s not on any tourist maps. The man who runs it, an old spacer named Jax, deals in information and discretion. And he still accepts currency the Republic forgot existed.” They had made it. Bruised, battered, and riding stolen bikes, they had crossed the city and found a doorway back into the galactic underworld Elara had spent ten years trying to escape. They had reached a safe harbour, but she knew it was a harbour full of sharks.## Chapter 6

The Thirsty Navigator was less a pub and more a scar on the waterfront, a place that had healed badly and been left to fester. The sign, a faded carving of a bewildered-looking man holding a sextant, had one flickering bulb that illuminated the name in intermittent, sickly yellow flashes. The door was a slab of heavy, salt-bleached wood that groaned in protest as Elara, leaning heavily on Maya, pushed it open. They stepped from the cold, clean night into a wall of warm, thick air, saturated with the smells of stale beer, frying oil, and something else—a sharp, metallic, ozone tang that reminded Elara of a malfunctioning hyperdrive. The low-ceilinged room was shrouded in a permanent twilight, the few light sources casting long, distorted shadows that writhed and coiled in the corners. The patrons, a sparse collection of hunched figures, did not so much turn to look as orient themselves towards the newcomers, a collective, silent assessment. There were weathered old men with the far-seeing eyes of sailors who had spent too long staring at horizons, and there were others whose silhouettes were subtly wrong—shoulders too broad, limbs too long, faces lost in the purposeful gloom.

Maya’s breath hitched, a tiny, sharp sound in the sudden quiet. She was a splash of bright, clean colour in a world of browns and greys, her fear a scent as potent as the spilled ale on the floorboards. Elara felt a wave of protective anger and channelled it into a mask of weary indifference. She ignored the stares, her gaze locking on the man behind the bar. He was wiping a thick, green-tinted glass with a rag that had given up on being clean long ago. He was broadly human, but his skin had the tough, leathery texture of old parchment, and one of his eyes was a dead, milky white. The other was sharp and dark and missed nothing. He didn’t speak, merely placing the glass down with a heavy thud and waiting. This was Jax. Elara had only ever heard descriptions of him, but the stoic, dangerous stillness was exactly as her long-dead contact had described. They began the slow, painful hobble towards him, a journey of twenty feet that felt like a mile under the weight of a dozen hostile stares.

“Bit of a rough night for a stroll,” Jax’s voice was a low rumble, like stones grinding together at the bottom of a river. His good eye flicked down to Elara’s ankle, now swollen to twice its normal size, then to Maya’s scraped hands and pale, shocked face. He wasn't offering sympathy; he was cataloguing weaknesses. “Looks like you tripped over the welcome mat.” Elara leaned against the sticky surface of the bar, the pain in her leg a constant, screaming distraction. She had to cut through the pleasantries, the testing of a potential mark. She pitched her voice low, using a phrase she hadn’t spoken in ten years, a piece of old smuggling cant. “The tides are high and the cargo is hot. I’m looking for a pilot, not a physician.”

Jax’s expression did not change, but a flicker of something new—recognition, and a deep, buried caution—stirred in his good eye. He stopped wiping the glass and folded his arms, his bulk seeming to fill the space behind the bar. “The pilots who used to answer that call are all either ghosts or rich men on worlds with better weather. You’re using old charts, lady.” He looked from Elara to Maya and back again, a faint, cynical smirk touching his lips. “And you’ve picked up a local guide. They never bring good luck.” The accusation hung in the air: she was a professional, tangled up with an amateur. It was a bad sign, a sign of desperation.

Elara ignored the jibe. There was no time to explain Maya, no way to make him understand. She reached into the inner pocket of her coat and pulled out the one thing she had brought from her old life besides her memories. The credit chip was a small, unassuming rectangle of dark, polished metal. She slid it across the bar. It stopped next to a puddle of spilled drink, its smooth, clean lines a stark contrast to the grime. “It’s a Republic bearer bond. Pre-Empire issue,” she said quietly. “Fully charged. I need a clean exchange. Sterling. As much as you can front. I also need a secure room for the night and information. I want to know what your network has heard about Imperial retrieval squads operating in this sector.”

The chip changed everything. The lazy contempt in Jax’s posture vanished, replaced by a sudden, sharp intensity. He leaned forward, his milky eye seeming to focus for the first time. The simple piece of metal was a relic from a fallen civilization, a key to a fortune that was now impossibly difficult and dangerous to access. It was the galactic equivalent of a solid gold bar from a sunken galleon. He picked it up, his thick fingers surprisingly gentle, turning it over and over. “A bearer bond,” he breathed, the words almost a prayer. “I haven’t seen one of these since a crazy Wookiee tried to buy my ship with one outside Nar Shaddaa.” He looked up at Elara, his gaze hard and calculating. “This kind of currency brings its own trouble. The kind of trouble that wears masks and doesn’t use the front door. What did you do to bring them down on you?”

“I got famous,” Elara said, the words tasting like ash. “And I used the wrong name.” It was all the explanation she was willing to give, and Jax seemed to understand that pressing for more would be pointless. The deal was on the table. The chip was the collateral. He weighed the immense profit against the colossal risk. For a long moment, the only sound was the low hum of a refrigeration unit somewhere behind the bar. “The exchange will be steep,” he rumbled finally, his decision made. “Twenty percent commission. The room is upstairs. It’s clean enough. As for information…” He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper that was for her alone. “You’re not the first. In the last month, two other… quiet people I know of have vanished from off-grid settlements. One on a moon near the Outer Rim, another from a floating city in the Bespin system. No witnesses, no debris. They just… stopped transmitting. The word on the shadow feeds is that the Empire is house-cleaning. Activating old census data. Your little TV show didn’t start the fire, lady. It just poured a barrel of fuel on it.”

The information hit Elara with the force of a physical blow. This wasn’t just about her. It was a purge. A systematic hunt for the last scattered embers of the Jedi and other Force-sensitives. She was just the latest name on a list, a list she hadn’t known existed. The realization was terrifying, but it was also clarifying. This wasn't a personal vendetta; it was a war she had just been involuntarily re-enlisted in. Jax seemed to read the grim understanding on her face. He tossed a heavy, old-fashioned iron key onto the bar. “Room four. Top of the stairs. Bolt the door. I’ll send someone up with the cash and some medical supplies in an hour. Don’t come down before morning.” He pocketed the credit chip, making it disappear into the folds of his clothing. The transaction was complete.

With the key clutched in her hand, Elara allowed Maya to help her away from the bar and towards a dark, narrow staircase in the back. As they passed, the patrons turned away, their brief interest evaporating. The deal was done, the curiosity sated. They were no longer a spectacle, just another piece of desperate cargo passing through Jax’s domain. The stairs were steep and creaked alarmingly, each step a fresh agony for Elara’s ankle. Room four was at the end of a short, grimy corridor. The key turned in the lock with a grating sound, and the door swung open into a small, box-like room. It contained a narrow metal-framed bed with a thin, stained mattress, a single wooden chair, and a small, cracked window that looked out onto a solid brick wall less than three feet away. The air was cold and smelled of damp and defeat. Maya helped Elara limp over to the bed, where she collapsed, her leg giving out completely. Maya kicked the door shut and, with a loud, final scrape, slid the heavy iron bolt into place. They were alone. They were fugitives. And in a squalid, anonymous room at the forgotten edge of a city on a forgotten planet, the next chapter of Elara Vane’s war had just begun.## Chapter 7

The bolt sliding home was a sound of absolute finality. It sealed them in, but it also sealed the world out. The small, cold room became their entire universe, an island of squalid safety in a sea of unknown threats. For a long time, neither of them moved. Maya stood with her back pressed against the door, as if holding it shut with her own will. Elara lay sprawled on the thin, lumpy mattress, her body a single, screaming nerve of pain and exhaustion. The adrenaline that had carried them across the rooftops and down the steep city hills had finally, completely abandoned them, leaving behind a heavy, leaden reality. The room smelled of mildew, dust, and the faint, bitter tang of cheap disinfectant that had long since lost its battle with the underlying grime. The only light came from the grimy window, a pale, reflected glow from some distant source that did little to dispel the shadows.

It was Maya who moved first, her practicality a survival instinct as sharp as any Jedi reflex. She peeled herself away from the door and crossed the small space to the bed. Her face, in the dim light, was a mask of exhaustion, her cheek smudged with dirt, her eyes shadowed and old. But beneath the fear, a flinty resolve was setting in. She looked at Elara’s grotesquely swollen ankle, propped awkwardly on the edge of the mattress, and her lips thinned into a firm line. “Right,” she said, her voice a low, determined rasp. “Let’s deal with the wreckage.” She began a methodical search of the room, her movements stiff and sore. She found a single, threadbare towel hanging on a hook behind the door and a metal bucket under the sink in the tiny, adjoining washroom. She turned the corroded tap, and after a moment of groaning protest, a trickle of rust-coloured water coughed out, eventually running cold and clear.

She returned with the damp towel and knelt by the bed. “This is going to hurt,” she stated, with no room for argument. Elara braced herself as Maya gently, carefully, began to wrap the cold, wet cloth around her ankle. The shock of the cold was breathtaking, a clean, sharp pain that momentarily eclipsed the throbbing ache. Elara gasped, her fingers digging into the thin mattress. “Jax said he’d send medical supplies,” she managed to say through gritted teeth. “Jax can take his time. Inflammation is the enemy,” Maya replied, her voice the calm, clipped tone of a paramedic at an accident scene. She was focusing on the one problem she could solve, building a small wall of practical action against the overwhelming, existential terror that was waiting just outside. As she worked, she talked, her voice a low, steady murmur that filled the oppressive silence. “When this is over, you’re buying me a spa weekend. A proper one. With fluffy robes and little cucumber slices for my eyes and someone to massage the garden hedgehog-shaped bruise off my backside.”

Elara felt a hysterical laugh bubble up in her chest. “I don’t think they accept pre-Empire bearer bonds,” she whispered. The small exchange broke the tension, a tiny crack in the wall of fear through which a little light could shine. Maya finished her work and sat back on her heels, looking at her friend. “What Jax said… about the others. The ones who have vanished.” The question hung in the cold air. Elara closed her eyes, the grim weight of the information settling on her once more. “It means my little talent show wasn't the cause. It was just a symptom. A catalyst.” She opened her eyes, her gaze distant, looking at something far beyond the grimy brick wall outside the window. “For ten years, I’ve been living by the first rule of survival: stay hidden. I thought I was honouring my Master’s sacrifice by just… staying alive. But a Jedi isn’t meant to just survive. They’re meant to serve. To protect.”

She struggled to sit up, ignoring the protest from her ankle. “All this time, I’ve been tending a garden while the whole forest was on fire. I’ve been straightening pictures while the whole house was collapsing. The balance I was trying to maintain was a fantasy. A quiet life in Clifton while the galaxy I came from slipped deeper into the dark. What was I protecting? My own peace? My own secret?” The bitterness in her voice was sharp. The escape pod, the quiet years, her life of tiny, secret interventions—it all felt like a colossal act of cowardice now. The hermit of Clifton hadn’t been enigmatic; she had been hiding. Maya listened, her expression serious. “You were a refugee, Eli. A traumatised kid who had lost everything. You weren’t hiding; you were healing. You survived. That’s not cowardice. That’s a miracle.”

Before Elara could reply, a soft, deliberate knock came at the door. It wasn’t the sound of a fist, but the rapping of hard knuckles, precise and measured. They both froze, every muscle tensed. Maya scrambled to her feet, placing herself between the bed and the door, her eyes wide. The knock came again, three soft, insistent taps. “Jax sent me,” a voice said, low and muffled by the thick wood. “Supplies.” Maya looked at Elara, her eyebrows raised in a silent question. Elara gave a short, sharp nod. With extreme caution, Maya drew back the heavy bolt and opened the door a crack, keeping her foot braced against it. The figure in the hall was small and wiry, a young woman no older than twenty. Her face was a sharp, angular sculpture of cheekbones and chin, framed by a shock of bright purple hair. She wore a patched-up pilot’s jacket and cargo pants, and a pair of tinted goggles were pushed up onto her forehead. She held a battered metal box in one hand and a bulging, greasy paper bag in the other. Her eyes, a startlingly pale grey, darted past Maya to assess Elara on the bed, taking in the situation with a glance that was as swift and comprehensive as Jax’s had been.

“He said you had a bad landing,” the girl said, her voice dry and unimpressed. She nudged the door with her boot. “Am I coming in or are we having a party in the hall?” Maya hesitated, then opened the door wider. The girl slipped inside, moving with a quick, restless energy that seemed too large for the small room. She dropped the metal box on the floor with a clang and tossed the paper bag onto the end of the bed. “Medpac, military grade. Should have what you need for the ankle. And your money,” she said, nodding at the bag. “Count it if you want, but it’s all there. Jax is many things, but he’s not a short-changer on a first deal.” She looked around the room, her expression one of profound distaste. “He also said to tell you the ship you’re looking for doesn’t exist. No one’s running unscheduled, long-haul charters out of this port. The imperial customs checks are too tight. Too many new patrol routes.” She paused, her pale eyes fixing on Elara. “But… he knows a guy who knows a guy who moves heavy freight. No questions asked. Takes off from a private field an hour from here. Leaves at dawn. If you want a bunk in the hold of a rust bucket hauling agricultural machinery to the mid-rim, that’s the best you’re going to get.”

The offer hung in the air, a single, dangerous lifeline thrown into their prison. Dawn. It was only a few hours away. It was a chance, but a desperate one. Elara’s mind raced. An unscheduled freighter. It was the classic smuggler’s run, the kind of transport that had always existed in the cracks of the galaxy. It was risky, anonymous, perfect. “What’s the price?” Elara asked. The girl shrugged. “Jax took his cut from the chip. The flight’s on him. A gesture of goodwill. He likes old money. Says it has character.” She turned to leave, her business concluded. “If you want it, be at the south end of the old cattle market at 0400. A green speeder truck will be waiting. If you’re not there, it won’t wait.” She paused with her hand on the doorknob. “And kid,” she said, her gaze directed at Maya. “Lose the coat. You stick out like a sore thumb on a stormtrooper.” With that parting advice, she was gone, slipping out the door and closing it quietly behind her. Maya bolted it again, her hands shaking slightly.

She turned and looked at Elara, her expression a mixture of terror and fierce determination. “A rust bucket to the mid-rim? What’s the mid-rim?” “Halfway between the Core Worlds and the Outer Rim,” Elara said, her mind already calculating, planning. “A vast, sprawling territory of thousands of worlds. Some are civilized, some are wild. It’s a good place to disappear.” She gestured to the paper bag. “The money. And the medpac.” Maya opened the metal box. Inside, nestled in foam, were synth-skin applicators, spray-on bacta patches, and a high-dosage injector for pain and inflammation. It was far more than simple first aid. She pulled out the injector and read the label. “This will get you walking,” she said, her voice grim. “At least for a while.” Then she opened the paper bag. Inside was a thick, untidy brick of used sterling notes. It was more cash than she had ever seen in one place. Tangible, real, and a one-way ticket away from everything she had ever known. They looked at the money, then at each other. The choice was made. Their lives in Bristol were over. Their future was a bunk in the hold of a smuggler’s ship, hurtling towards a destination unknown.The silence that followed the courier’s departure was heavier than the one before. It was no longer the silence of sanctuary, but the silence of a tomb, the quiet of a life that had officially ended. Maya sank onto the single wooden chair, her body slumping as if its strings had been cut. She stared at the bag of money, then at the medpac, her gaze empty. Her hand went to her pocket and she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up her face, illuminating the tracks of fresh tears. She swiped through photos, a frantic, silent litany of her lost world: a blurry selfie with her mum at a garden centre, her beaming face next to her ridiculously small but beloved car, a group shot from a disastrous office Christmas party. Each image was a ghost, a happy memory from a person who no longer existed. With a final, shuddering sigh, she held her thumb over the power button, hesitated for a heartbeat, and then pressed down until the screen went black for the last time. She placed the dead phone on the floor beside her as if laying a flower on a grave.

Elara watched her friend’s quiet, desperate farewell and felt a pain sharper than the one in her ankle. Guilt was a luxury, but the responsibility was a crushing weight. She pushed herself into a sitting position, her voice raspy. "Maya. We don't have time for grief. We can do that on the ship. Right now, we need to be functional." She pointed a trembling finger at the medpac. "Bring it here." Maya moved as if in a trance, fetching the box. Elara opened it, her hands surprisingly steady. "This is an auto-injector," she explained, pulling out the device. It was a sleek, metallic cylinder. "It's loaded with a fast-acting synthetic cellular regenerator and a nerve block. You press the activator here, and then you inject it directly into the swollen tissue around the joint. It will feel like fire, and then like ice. And you have to hold it there for a ten-count. Can you do it?" Maya looked at the injector, then at Elara's determined, pain-filled eyes. She took the device, her knuckles white. "Just tell me when," she said, her voice a reedy thread of sound. Elara took a deep, centering breath, and nodded. The hiss of the injector was followed by a sharp, strangled cry from Elara, a sound she couldn't suppress as the alien chemicals flooded her system, forcibly and unnaturally persuading her torn tissues to bind themselves back together.

The effects were brutally swift. The fire turned to a spreading, unnatural cold, a numbness that felt like a void where her ankle used to be. After a few minutes, Elara swung her legs off the bed and tentatively placed her foot on the floor. She put weight on it. It held. The pain was gone, replaced by a disturbing lack of sensation, a disquieting feeling that her foot was no longer entirely her own. "I can walk," she said, a note of wonder in her voice. She took a stiff, awkward step, then another. Her gait was uneven, lacking its natural grace, but she was mobile. That was all that mattered. Her gaze immediately fell on Maya’s coat, a splash of vibrant, defiant pink slung over the back of the chair. "The girl was right," Elara said, her voice now hard and practical. "The coat has to go. It’s a beacon." Maya looked at her favourite coat, a garment that was so intrinsically *her*, and gave a short, bitter laugh. "Right. No more pink." She shrugged it off, folding it neatly before stuffing it unceremoniously into the metal bucket. It felt like another funeral. Elara dug into the small satchel she'd managed to grab from her flat—the only thing she’d brought besides her coat—and pulled out a shapeless, dark grey woollen jumper. "It's not much," she said, handing it to Maya. "But it's anonymous."

They spent the next twenty minutes preparing for their new lives as fugitives. The transformation was swift and grim. Maya pulled on the grey jumper, the colour seeming to drain the last of the life from her face. She looked like a stranger, a drab, frightened ghost. They divided the cash, stuffing the thick, unfamiliar bundles into every available pocket of their jeans and jackets, the bulk of it awkward and conspicuous. Elara took the remaining medical supplies and her holoprojector, wrapping them in a spare t-shirt and tucking them deep into her satchel. They were shedding their identities piece by piece, discarding colours, erasing data, reducing themselves to a function: survival. As Maya made a final, grim check of the room, Elara stood by the window, her hand resting against the cold, grimy glass. She closed her eyes, not to meditate, but to listen. The city was a deep, sleeping beast. The cold, analytical minds of the hunters were gone, their search pattern having moved elsewhere. But she knew they weren't gone for good. They were resetting, gathering intelligence, preparing for the next, more thorough sweep. The freighter at dawn was not just their best chance; it was their only one.

Their departure from the Thirsty Navigator was the quietest, most terrifying journey of Maya’s life. They slipped out of their room, the re-oiled bolt sliding back with a soft, greasy whisper. The corridor was empty. The stairs creaked under Elara’s stiff, heavy tread, each sound a cannon shot in the stillness. The common room below was dark and deserted, the air thick with the ghosts of the night’s transactions. Jax was gone, the bar wiped clean, all evidence of their presence erased. They were phantoms who had never been there. The heavy front door opened onto a world that had shifted. The pre-dawn air was cold and smelled of low tide and wet stone. The narrow street was empty, washed in the thin, grey light that precedes the sun. It was the hour of emptiness, where the city held its breath between the last echoes of the night and the first stirrings of the day. They did not speak, moving as one organism down the cobbled street, staying close to the deep shadows cast by the silent, looming warehouses.

The cattle market was a vast, desolate expanse on the industrial fringe of the city. A sprawling grid of empty pens, rusting metal railings, and wide, cracked concrete lanes, it smelled of wet earth, old iron, and the faint, phantom scent of a million animals that had passed through on their way to slaughter. It was a place of final journeys, a fitting port of departure. They found the south end, a wide, open space bordered by a crumbling brick wall. There was nothing there. Just the wind, whistling a low, mournful tune through the empty railings. They huddled in the lee of a concrete loading bay, hidden from the open space, and waited. Every minute stretched into an eternity. Elara’s enhanced ankle began to ache with a deep, chilling cold. Maya’s teeth chattered, a sound that seemed deafening in the silence. The temptation to believe they had been tricked, that this was all a cruel joke by Jax, was immense. The sky in the east was beginning to soften from black to a deep, bruised indigo. Time was running out. Just as a sliver of true despair began to set in, a pair of low, wide headlights cut through the gloom at the far end of the market. A vehicle was approaching, its engine a low, powerful growl. It was moving slowly, cautiously, its broad, dark-green silhouette solidifying as it drew closer. It was a heavy, utilitarian speeder truck, its cargo bed covered by a stained canvas tarp. It rolled to a halt in the centre of the open space, fifty yards away, and its engine died, plunging the market back into a profound and watchful silence.### Chapter 8

The truck just sat there, a block of silent, impassive metal in the vast, empty market. The pre-dawn light was the colour of a day-old bruise, and the wind carried the phantom smell of rain. For a full minute, nothing happened. The silence was a test of nerve, a question asked without words. Elara knew this game. Show your desperation, and the price goes up. Show your fear, and you become a liability. She pushed herself away from the concrete wall, her new, numb ankle taking her weight with an unsettling solidity. She looked at Maya, whose face was a pale oval of fear in the gloom. “Stay behind me. Walk, don’t run. And don’t speak unless I speak to you.” Her voice was flat, the voice of someone who had learned these rules in a much harder school than a Bristol back-alley. They stepped out from the shadows of the loading bay and began the long walk across the open ground. Each step was a deliberate act of faith, a wager that the green truck was their salvation and not their executioner. The fifty yards felt like a mile, their footsteps unnervingly loud on the cracked concrete. They were two small, insignificant figures moving towards a dark, hulking machine, utterly exposed under the vast, uncaring sky.

As they drew near, the driver’s-side window hissed down, revealing the silhouette of a man. He was old, his face a roadmap of deep-creased lines, one half of it illuminated by the faint green glow of a console display. A cybernetic lens, a dull red optical sensor, whirred softly as it focused on them, replacing his left eye. It took in Elara’s stiff gait, Maya’s shivering form, and the grim set of their faces. He didn't look like a saviour. He looked like a man who had seen too many desperate people and had stopped caring about their stories long ago. “Jax’s strays?” he grunted, his voice like gravel stirred with engine oil. Elara gave a single, sharp nod. He jerked his head towards the back of the truck. “Get in. Under the tarp. Stay down and stay quiet until I tell you otherwise.” The window hissed shut before she could reply. There was no welcome, no reassurance. They were cargo. Maya looked at Elara, her eyes wide with a fresh wave of fear, but Elara’s expression was unreadable. She walked to the back of the truck, unfastened a heavy clasp, and lifted the stiff, grimy canvas. The space beneath was dark and smelled powerfully of chemical fertiliser and hydraulic fluid. Without a word, she climbed in, pulling Maya in after her. They huddled together on the cold metal floor as the canvas dropped, plunging them into a near-total, suffocating darkness. A moment later, the engine roared to life with a deep, shuddering growl, and the truck began to move.

The journey was a blind, bone-jarring ordeal. They were thrown against the hard sides of the truck bed as it navigated the broken roads of the industrial estate, the powerful engine making the floor vibrate beneath them. The world outside was reduced to a series of muffled rumbles, the occasional hiss of air brakes, and the rhythmic flapping of the canvas in the wind. In the suffocating darkness, all sense of direction was lost. They could have been driving in circles or heading straight for a trap, and they would have had no way of knowing. Maya was curled into a tight ball, her hands pressed over her ears, trying to block out the overwhelming sensory assault. Elara sat still, her back braced against the cab, her senses extended. She wasn't looking for hunters anymore. She was listening for the lie, for the subtle dissonance in the driver’s mind that would signal betrayal. But there was nothing. Only a weary professionalism, a deep-seated boredom, and the mental checklist of a man thinking about his next fuel stop. Reaching out in the dark, Elara found Maya’s hand and squeezed it. The touch was an anchor, a silent promise in the roaring, rattling void.

After what felt like an eternity, the truck slowed, its engine noise dropping to a low idle. It turned sharply, leaving the rough tarmac for the soft, sucking sound of mud. The jolting ceased, replaced by a smoother, gliding motion. A few moments later, it stopped. The engine cut out, and the sudden silence was deafening. The canvas flap was thrown back, and the grey morning light flooded in, painfully bright. “Out,” the driver grunted, not even looking at them. “You’ve got ten minutes. The ship waits for no one.” They scrambled out, stiff and disoriented, onto a patch of muddy grass. The air was thick with fog and the rich, earthy smell of damp soil. They were in a huge, open field, bordered on one side by a line of skeletal trees and on the other by a series of derelict agricultural buildings with collapsed roofs. And in the centre of the field, looming out of the mist like a mountain that had grown from the earth, was the ship. It was a Corellian bulk freighter, an old YT-series model, but one so heavily and crudely modified it was barely recognizable. Its hull was a patchwork of mismatched plates, some gleaming with newness, others scarred with rust and blaster burns. External conduits and extra fuel tanks clung to its sides like barnacles. It was ugly, functional, and immense. This was *The Sodbuster*. A wide cargo ramp was lowered from its belly, spilling a pool of harsh yellow light onto the damp ground.

Figures moved in the mist around the ship's ramp, their shapes indistinct, their voices low and urgent as they guided the last of the cargo aboard with hovering lifter droids. No one paid Elara and Maya any attention as they began their final walk across the wet field. They were just two more shadows in a scene of organised chaos. The closer they got, the more the scale of the ship hit them. It wasn't just a vehicle; it was a small, mobile town. The air around it thrummed with the low-frequency hum of its power core and smelled of ionized air and hot metal. At the top of the ramp stood a tall, broad-shouldered woman in a grease-stained flight suit, a datapad in her hand. Her face was stern, her short-cropped hair streaked with grey. She watched them approach, her eyes missing nothing. “Jax’s passengers?” she called out, her voice crisp and authoritative. Elara nodded, her own voice lost to the wind. The woman made a mark on her datapad. “Good. You’re the last. Bunk 7, aft cargo hold. Strap in and stay there until we clear the atmosphere. Don’t touch anything. Don’t talk to anyone. If you get sick, use the bags. You make a mess in my hold, I vent you with the garbage. Clear?” Elara nodded again. The woman gestured them aboard with a flick of her head, her attention already turning to the crewman securing the final crate.

The interior of the hold was a cavernous, metallic labyrinth. Crates of agricultural machinery, their shapes shrouded in protective coverings, were lashed to the deck with thick magnetic clamps. The air was cold and recycled, thick with the smells of lubricant and the faint, sweet scent of what might have been livestock. A crewman, his face hidden by the hood of his jumpsuit, pointed them towards a narrow catwalk that ran along the side of the hold. At the far end, tucked away behind a massive coolant pipe, was Bunk 7. It was not a cabin. It was a tiny alcove, barely large enough for two people, containing two fold-down webbing cots and a small locker. A single, bare bulb cast a weak, flickering light over the cramped space. This was their new home. Maya stared at it, her face a mask of numb disbelief. Her life of council meetings, comfortable flats, and weekend trips to the seaside had shrunk to this: a grimy metal box in the belly of a smuggler's ship. Before she could speak, a deep, grinding groan echoed through the hold. The massive cargo ramp began to rise, its gears protesting as it sealed them in. The pool of grey morning light shrank to a sliver, and then vanished, plunging the hold into a darkness broken only by the dim, scattered service lights. The world they knew was gone.

A deep vibration started in the deck plates, travelling up through Elara’s numb foot and into her bones. The low hum of the power core intensified, rising in pitch until it was a resonant, all-encompassing roar. The ship shuddered, a giant beast waking from its sleep. On her cot, Maya squeezed her eyes shut, her hands gripping the webbing so tightly her knuckles were white. The ship lurched, a sickening, lifting sensation that felt less like flight and more like a controlled fall upwards. The noise was immense, a physical force that vibrated in their teeth and chests. They were rising. Leaving the field, the city, the world behind. Elara closed her eyes, but her senses soared. She felt the ship punching through the thick, wet blanket of the clouds, the texture of the Living Force changing around them as they ascended. She felt the planet’s vibrant, chaotic, life-filled aura fall away beneath them, a familiar warmth receding into the distance. It was a profound and wrenching departure, the severing of a ten-year bond. And then, they were through. The roar of the atmospheric engines cut out, replaced by the silent, powerful thrum of the sublight drive. A profound stillness descended.

Maya cautiously opened her eyes. Tucked into the wall of their alcove was a tiny, thick porthole, no bigger than her hand. Hesitantly, she unstrapped herself and crawled towards it. She peered through the thick, scratched plasteel and gasped. The sight stole the air from her lungs. Below them, swathed in a brilliant swirl of white cloud, was the planet, a breathtakingly beautiful blue and green marble hanging in an endless, perfect black. And all around it, scattered like diamond dust on black velvet, were the stars. They weren't the faint, distant pinpricks she had known her whole life. They were fierce, brilliant, terrifyingly close points of light, an ocean of them, stretching into an infinity that her mind could not comprehend. Tears streamed down her face, tears not of sorrow or fear, but of pure, unadulterated awe. They had made it. They were in space. They were free. And they were more lost than they had ever been in their lives.The tears that streamed down Maya’s face were not for the life she had lost, but for the universe she had found. Pressed against the cold, thick plasteel of the porthole, she felt the last ten years of ordinary, ground-level existence dissolve into absurdity. The planet below, their home, was a perfect, impossible jewel, and the stars were not the gentle, twinkling lights of poetry but a fierce, silent fire, burning in a blackness so absolute it felt like a presence. It was the most beautiful, most terrifying thing she had ever seen. She was an ant who had spent her entire life crawling on a single painted leaf, only to be lifted up to see the whole, infinite forest. Her own small world of council planning reports and favourite coffee shops had been violently torn away, but in its place, she had been given this: a glimpse of the sublime.

Elara did not join her at the window. She lay on the webbing cot, feeling the final, faint threads of her connection to the planet snap one by one. For ten years, the Living Force of that world—the chaotic, vibrant, messy hum of its billions of lives—had been a constant, ambient music. She had filtered it, ignored it, but it had always been there, a grounding presence. Now, it was gone, and the silence it left behind was a profound and aching hollowness. The silent, indifferent Force of deep space rushed in to fill the void, vast and cold and clean. For Maya, this was a moment of discovery. For Elara, it was a moment of profound, sorrowful homecoming. She was back in the great emptiness she had once fled, a ghost returning to her own haunted house.

A harsh, metallic crackle echoed through the hold, startling them both. "Attention, passengers," the Captain’s gruff voice boomed from a hidden speaker, distorted and impersonal. "Preparing for hyperspace transition in thirty seconds. If this is your first time, try not to throw up. The clean-up fee is astronomical." Maya scrambled back to her cot, her heart hammering, and fumbled with the webbing straps, securing herself tightly. She looked at Elara, whose eyes were already closed, her face a pale, serene mask that did little to hide the tension in her jaw. The low thrum of the sublight engines began to climb in pitch, a rising, whining crescendo that vibrated through the metal deck. A new, deeper throb joined it, a bass note that felt less like a sound and more like a change in the fundamental pressure of the universe.

Through the tiny porthole, the stars began to move. At first, it was a subtle shift, a slow drift. Then, with a lurch that twisted Maya’s stomach, the ship seemed to stretch, and the stars followed suit. The points of brilliant light elongated into thin, blue-white lines, streaking past the window, pulling the darkness of space with them. The view became a swirling tunnel of incandescent light, a vortex of impossible speed. And then, just as suddenly as it began, it resolved. The streaks vanished, replaced by a strange, fluid, ever-shifting river of bluish-white energy, a landscape of pure light and motion that flowed past the ship in uncanny silence. There was no sensation of movement, only the visual proof of it. The deep thrum of the hyperdrive settled into a steady, monotonous hum, the new rhythm of their lives. They were no longer in space. They were somewhere else entirely, a place between places, hurtling through an unreal dimension at a speed that had no meaning. The final tether to their old life was not just cut; it had been atomized.

Days bled into one another, marked only by the flicking on and off of the main hold lights on a roughly standardised twenty-four-hour cycle. Time became a thick, stagnant pool. Their world shrank to the confines of the metal alcove and the treacherous catwalks of the cargo hold. Twice a cycle, a sullen-faced crewman would appear and leave two protein paste packets and two sealed bulbs of purified water on the deck outside their bunk, never making eye contact, never speaking a word. The food was a bland, gritty substance that tasted of nutrients and nothing else. The water was sterile and tasteless. It was the barest minimum required to sustain life, and it hammered home their status as little more than self-loading cargo. Maya’s initial awe faded, replaced by a gnawing claustrophobia and a profound, grinding boredom. She paced their tiny alcove, a caged animal, her mind, so used to being filled with problems and schedules, now a vacant, echoing space.

Elara, by contrast, fell into a different rhythm. She spent long hours in a state of deep meditation, her breathing shallow, her body utterly still. She was not seeking peace, but control. Out here, in the sterile environment of the ship, her Force signature, however faint, felt dangerously loud. She was consciously, painstakingly rebuilding the mental shields her Master had tried to teach her, banking the fire of her presence, trying to become a psychic blank. The numb, dead feeling in her ankle was a constant reminder of the cost of losing control, of burning too bright. The synthetic regenerators had done their work, but the healing was crude, leaving behind a network of fine scar tissue and a persistent, chilling numbness that she feared might be permanent. She was wounded, and her power was a liability. The galaxy she had re-entered was not one that tolerated Jedi, however broken or lost they might be.

On the third cycle, a new reality pierced their monotonous existence. Maya, driven by a desperate need for a change of scenery, had ventured to the ‘fresher unit at the far end of the hold, a foul-smelling metal closet that made their bunk feel like a palace. On her way back, she saw another passenger for the first time. He was a Rodian, his green, snout-nosed face etched with anxiety, emerging from an alcove identical to theirs two bays down. Their eyes met for a fleeting second, and Maya saw in his large, black, multifaceted eyes the same desperate, hunted fear she felt in her own heart. There was no greeting, no acknowledgement. He immediately lowered his head and scurried back into the shadows of his own hiding place, another piece of anonymous, terrified cargo. She returned to their bunk, her face pale. “We’re not the only ones,” she whispered to Elara. “There are others. Running, just like us.” Elara nodded slowly, her eyes closed. “Jax said he knew two others who had vanished. How many more are there?” The question was chilling. They weren’t just fugitives; they were part of a secret, scattered diaspora, a species being driven to extinction, and they were all crammed together in the belly of this ship, a collection of the last of their kind.

That evening, as they chewed their way through another joyless meal, Maya finally broke the silence that had grown between them. "So what's the actual plan, Eli? 'The Mid-Rim' isn't a plan; it's a direction of travel. We can't just float around forever in a tin can full of terrified aliens and tractor parts." She needed a destination, a name, a concrete goal to cling to in this terrifyingly abstract new reality. Elara put down her half-eaten paste packet. She had been dreading this, but Maya was right. Hope required a destination. “I’ve been thinking about that. The galaxy is… smaller than it used to be. The Empire’s reach is long. We can’t go anywhere with a major spaceport or a strong central government. That means no trade hubs, no wealthy core-adjacent worlds.” She pulled her knees to her chest, her mind scrolling through star charts she hadn’t accessed in a decade. "We need somewhere on the fringes. A place that’s too insignificant, too chaotic, or too poor for the Empire to bother policing it too closely. A place with a transient population, where new faces don’t attract attention." She paused, her gaze becoming distant. "There's a place. An asteroid colony in the Vashka Nebula. It's technically in the Mid-Rim, but it’s so far off the main hyperlanes that most people forget it exists. It’s called Shanti’s Drift."

The name was a strange combination of peace and rootlessness. "Shanti's Drift," Maya repeated, testing the sound of it. "What's it like?" Elara gave a faint, weary smile. "It's a mess. It started as a mining outpost a century ago, and when the ore ran out, the corporation left. But the workers stayed. They hollowed out the biggest asteroid, built a city inside it. It has no government to speak of, just a loose confederation of guild bosses and strong-arm security squads. It’s run on barter, back-room deals, and a healthy disrespect for Imperial law. It’s dirty, it’s dangerous, and it’s full of smugglers, pirates, and refugees from a hundred different worlds.” She looked at Maya, her expression deadly serious. “It’s one of the few places in the galaxy where two women with a bag full of cash and no official identity can walk in and rent a room without anyone asking a single question. It's a perfect place to disappear. For a while." It wasn’t a promise of a new life. It was, at best, the promise of a better hiding place, a deeper shadow to disappear into. But it was a destination. It was a plan. For the first time since they had left Earth, they had a future, however grim and uncertain it might be.The name, Shanti’s Drift, became a mantra in the dark belly of the ship. For Maya, it was a destination, a pin on a map that was otherwise a terrifying, featureless black. She would make Elara describe it again and again, her practical mind desperate for details to construct a mental blueprint of their future. She learned that the ‘city’ was called the Hollow, that power was a constant struggle, with frequent brownouts in the lower levels. She learned that the air, recycled for a century, always carried the faint taste of metal dust and hydroponic chemicals. She learned that the station’s economy ran on a currency of favours, secrets, and hard, untraceable credits. Elara’s descriptions, drawn from fragments of stories she had overheard a decade ago, painted a picture of a precarious, desperate, but fiercely independent existence. It was a bleak picture, but for Maya, bleak was better than the terrifying abstraction of being adrift. It was a problem she could start to analyse, a system she could learn.

Elara indulged her, understanding that Maya’s endless questions were a form of self-preservation, a way of building a new reality with words when the old one had been shattered. But while she spoke of docking bays and black markets, her own focus was turned inward. The days were spent in a deep, healing trance, her consciousness sinking into the slow, rhythmic work of mending her own frayed spirit. The sudden, violent expenditure of the Force had left tears in her psychic fabric, and she was painstakingly reweaving them, thread by thread. The Force was not a tool to be used lightly, her Master had taught her, and she had used it like a sledgehammer. The numbness in her ankle was a constant, physical reminder of that spiritual cost. When she wasn’t meditating, she would guide Maya through simple breathing exercises, teaching her to find a center in the chaos, to build a small, quiet room inside her own mind where the fear could not reach her. They were small lessons, the first lessons a Jedi youngling might learn, but for Maya, they were a lifeline.

Their brief, silent encounters with the other passengers became a new, unspoken routine. They learned to recognise the quick, furtive movements of a family of four—two parents and two small children—whose fur was the colour of desert sand. They would emerge only to collect their rations, their faces a mixture of exhaustion and fierce, parental vigilance. One cycle, Maya saw the Rodian again, exchanging a small, folded parcel with one of the sullen crewmen for a piece of fresh fruit. He saw her watching, and his snout twitched in alarm before he vanished back into his alcove. It was a tiny, illicit transaction, a small act of defiance to procure a moment of comfort in their shared purgatory. These silent encounters wove an invisible web of community through the cold metal of the hold. They were strangers, but they shared the same secret, the same pursuers. They were the hunted, a flock of different species crammed into a single, speeding ark, and their shared fear was a language more eloquent than words.

The end of the journey came without warning. One moment they were suspended in the monotonous, silent river of hyperspace, the next the ship gave a violent, gut-wrenching lurch, and reality reasserted itself with the force of a physical blow. The strange, flowing light in the porthole vanished, replaced by the familiar, terrifying blackness of real space, pricked with the sharp, cold points of distant stars. The deep hum of the hyperdrive died, leaving a silence that felt profound and fragile. After days in the unreal corridor between worlds, the return to normal physics was a shock to the system. Maya felt a wave of nausea, her inner ear struggling to recalibrate to a universe that had rules again.

Elara was already at the porthole, her hand pressed against the plasteel. "We're here," she breathed. "The Vashka Nebula." Maya crawled over to join her, her stomach still churning. The view was unlike anything she had ever imagined. They were floating on the edge of a celestial storm, a vast, swirling cloud of incandescent gas that blazed with colours her eyes had never before witnessed. Ribbons of deep violet and shimmering magenta twisted around clouds of electric blue and emerald green. In the heart of it, a cluster of young, hot stars burned with a fierce white light, illuminating the gas from within like cosmic lanterns. It was beautiful, but it was also chaotic and violent, a place where stars were being born and dying in a furious, elemental dance. It was a place where it would be very, very easy to get lost.

As the *Sodbuster* nudged its way cautiously into the outer veils of the nebula, the ship’s comm crackled to life again. "Approaching Shanti's Drift," the Captain's voice announced, devoid of any awe for the spectacle outside. "Standard docking procedures. Disembarkation on my signal. Welcome to the edge of nowhere. Try not to get shanked in the first five minutes." The ship banked, and a new object swam into the view of the porthole, eclipsing the beauty of the nebula. It was an asteroid, but one that had been brutalized by industry. It was a colossal, jagged shard of rock, miles long, its surface a pockmarked hellscape of abandoned mining quarries, deep fissures, and the skeletal remains of old industrial structures. And grafted onto its surface, burrowing into its core, was the city. It was not a single, elegant structure, but a cancerous growth of modules, docking arms, habitation spheres, and glowing windows, all connected by a chaotic web of sealed transit tubes and exposed power conduits. Lights blinked and glittered all over its surface, some bright and steady, others flickering erratically. Dozens of ships, from tiny, wasp-like couriers to freighters as large as their own, swarmed around it like insects drawn to a strange, ugly flower.

Elara could feel it through the hull, a psychic roar that made the quiet hum of the planet she’d left behind seem like a whisper. It was the concentrated energy of a hundred thousand beings crammed into a hollowed-out rock, a maelstrom of ambition, greed, fear, hope, and desperation. It was the loudest, messiest, most chaotic concentration of life she had ever felt. It was appalling. And it was perfect. "That," she said, her voice low as the *Sodbuster* aligned itself with a flashing set of docking lights, "is Shanti's Drift." The ship gave a final, metallic shudder as magnetic clamps engaged with a deafening clang, locking them to the station. A loud klaxon blared through the hold, the signal for disembarkation. Their journey was over. Their new life, as anonymous refugees in the galactic underworld, was about to begin.## Chapter 9

The klaxon’s final, jarring echo was swallowed by the deep, grinding groan of the cargo ramp descending. A harsh, yellow rectangle of light cut through the gloom of the hold, illuminating a swirling fog of dust motes and exhaust fumes. With it came the first wave of the station’s reality: a wall of sound, a cacophony of languages, klaxons, and the deep, resonant hum of a million tons of machinery and life support systems straining to function. It was accompanied by a smell that was dense and complex, a stew of ozone from arcing power conduits, the spicy aroma of alien street food, and the ever-present, metallic tang of recycled air. The other shadow-passengers, the Rodian and the desert-furred family, moved with a sudden, practiced urgency. They did not look back. They simply melted into the flow of beings moving on and off the ramp, their forms dissolving into the greater anonymity of the crowd, their experience in the art of disappearance painfully obvious.

Elara and Maya were the last to the precipice. They stood for a moment at the edge of the ramp, two figures blinking in the harsh light, looking down into the seething chaos of the main docking bay. It was a cavern of unimaginable scale, its ceiling lost in a hazy darkness crisscrossed with glowing transit tubes and flickering industrial lights. Below, a river of beings flowed in every direction: hulking, fur-covered laborers hauling anti-grav sleds, slender droids zipping past on unseen errands, clusters of robed merchants haggling in low tones, and station security personnel in scuffed, non-standard armour watching the crowds with bored, predatory eyes. The psychic noise was a physical blow, a thousand times worse than the backstage of the Hippodrome. It was a roar of greed, fear, hope, and exhaustion that slammed into Elara’s carefully constructed shields, threatening to overwhelm her. She winced, forcing her focus down to a single, sharp point: the texture of the metal ramp beneath her feet.

“Come on,” she said, her voice tight as she grabbed Maya’s arm. “We’re a target standing here.” She pulled her friend down the ramp and into the maelstrom. The moment they stepped onto the main concourse floor, they were swept into the current. The sheer diversity of life was staggering. Beings with multiple limbs, beings with carapaces, beings that floated a foot off the ground—it was a biological census of the galaxy’s forgotten and marginalized. The air vibrated with the energy of a place that never slept, a place where fortunes were made and lives were lost in the same hour. Maya’s face was a mask of stunned terror, her eyes wide as she tried to process the impossible sensory data. She felt fragile and breakable, a creature of soft flesh and simple biology in a world of claws and chitin.

They were jostled and shoved, invisible and yet horrifically conspicuous at the same time. A vendor with a face like a melted candle tried to press a skewer of sizzling, unidentifiable meat into Maya’s hand. A child with large, liquid-black eyes and four spindly arms pointed at them and chittered something to its parent. Elara steered them through the thickest part of the crowd, her hand a firm, grounding pressure on Maya’s arm. Her senses, though battered, were sharp. She could feel the flickers of avarice from petty thieves sizing them up, the casual scrutiny of the security guards, the desperate hunger of the beggars lining the walls. They looked like what they were: fresh arrivals, dazed and carrying everything they owned.

“Where are we going?” Maya yelled, her voice barely audible over the din. Elara didn’t look at her, her gaze fixed ahead, scanning the chaotic signage that flickered and buzzed on the walls. Most of it was in alien scripts, but the universal symbols were clear enough. She pointed not towards the signs for ‘Guest Habitation’ and ‘Central Exchange’, which led upwards on brightly lit escalators, but towards a massive, unadorned archway from which a steady stream of the station’s working class flowed. Above it, a single sign in battered Aurebesh read: ‘Lower Levels’. “We’re going down,” Elara said, her voice grim. “The station is built in layers. The higher you go, the more expensive and the more official it gets. Down is where people like us live. In the Roots.”

Joining the downward flow was like descending into a different world. They moved down a wide, spiraling ramp that corkscrewed deep into the asteroid’s core. The air grew warmer and more humid, the metallic tang becoming more pronounced. The light changed from the harsh, functional white of the docking bay to a dimmer, more erratic collection of sputtering glow-panels and bare, coloured bulbs. The walls were no longer clean durasteel but a rough-hewn rock face, slick with moisture and crisscrossed with a terrifying, ad-hoc tangle of power cables and pipes, some of which dripped a dark, viscous fluid onto the walkway below. The sounds changed too; the sharp, official noises of the docking bay were replaced by the deep, rhythmic clang of heavy industry, the hiss of unregulated workshops, and the distant, thumping bass of music from behind closed doors.

When they finally stepped off the ramp, they were in a labyrinth. This was the Roots. It was a warren of narrow, winding corridors and multi-levelled plazas, where walkways bridged dizzying drops and staircases seemed to lead nowhere. There were no formal signs here, only symbols spray-painted on walls and crudely carved into doorframes. It was a city that had grown organically, without a plan, driven by necessity and desperation. Elara led them away from the main thoroughfare, down a smaller, darker passage. She was moving on instinct now, a sense memory pieced together from a dozen smuggler’s tales. She was looking for a sign, a feeling, a place that resonated with the quiet hum of discretion rather than the loud shout of commerce.

She stopped before a heavy, rust-streaked metal door, indistinguishable from a dozen others they had passed, save for a small, barely visible symbol etched into the metal: a serpent, coiled in a circle, devouring its own tail. “Here,” she whispered, her voice tight with a mixture of hope and trepidation. She took a moment to compose herself, to project an aura of weary confidence she was far from feeling. She could feel the thick wads of cash in her pockets, a dangerous weight that seemed to burn against her skin. Taking a deep, steadying breath that did little to calm her hammering heart, she raised her hand and knocked three times on the cold, unforgiving metal. There was a long pause, and then a loud, grating scrape from within. A rectangular slot slid open at eye level, revealing nothing but a pair of glowing, red, multifaceted eyes that regarded them with cold, insectile intelligence.A dry, rasping voice issued from the slot, a series of sharp, clicking sounds that coalesced into a sibilant, synthetic whisper. The sound scraped at the edges of Elara’s hearing, alien and devoid of warmth. “State your purpose. State your affiliation.” The red, multifaceted eyes did not blink; they simply absorbed the light and reflected nothing back. They were the eyes of a creature that saw the world in a thousand different facets, calculating angles and assessing threats with a cold, biological precision. Maya flinched at the sound, pressing herself into Elara’s back as if trying to merge with her shadow. The weight of the stares in the corridor behind them felt like a physical pressure, a hundred potential dangers waiting for them to be turned away.

Elara kept her voice low and even, pitching it just loud enough to be heard through the thick door. She had to project a weary competence, the air of someone who knew the rules of this kind of transaction. “We need a room,” she said, the words stark and simple. “No affiliation. We’re neutral and we’re quiet. We pay in advance.” To punctuate the statement, she reached into her jacket pocket and pulled out a small, tight wad of the sterling notes she had separated from the main bundle, holding it up so the eyes in the slot could see. The red lenses shifted, their focus tightening on the cash for a long, appraising moment. “Everyone is neutral until the price is right to betray someone,” the synthetic voice rasped back. “And everyone is quiet until a blaster bolt comes through their door looking for them.” Despite the cynical words, there was a shift in the energy from behind the door, the barest flicker of transactional interest. “Two cycles minimum. Standard rate. No questions asked means no trouble brought. You bring trouble here, you will find yourself back on the concourse, minus your payment.”

“No trouble,” Elara confirmed, her voice a flat promise. The silence stretched for another heartbeat, a final, silent assessment. Then came a sharp click, and the sound of multiple, heavy locks being disengaged in sequence. The metal door swung inward with a surprising, well-oiled silence, revealing the being who had been studying them. It was a tall, impossibly slender insectoid, a member of the Geonosian species, its skeletal frame covered in a chitinous exoskeleton the colour of rust and old bone. Its spindly limbs moved with a jerky, precise grace, and its elongated head, dominated by the two glowing red compound eyes, tilted as it regarded them. He gestured them inside with a thin, three-fingered hand. “Kaelen,” he said, his voice the same dry whisper, identifying himself as the proprietor. “Enter.”

The interior was a stark and shocking contrast to the filth and chaos of the corridor. The air was cool, dry, and smelled faintly of ozone from an air purifier humming softly in the corner. The space was a single, long chamber, but it was impeccably clean, the floor a polished, dark composite material, the walls smooth and unadorned. A dozen identical, heavy metal doors lined one wall, each with a small, glowing number plate above it. It was not a guesthouse; it was a vault for sentient beings, a place designed for absolute privacy and security. The silence inside was profound, a sudden, blessed absence of the station’s overwhelming noise. It was the most luxurious thing they had experienced since leaving Earth.

Kaelen led them to a door marked with a softly glowing ‘7’ and tapped a code into a keypad beside it. The door slid open with a whisper. “The unit is shielded against passive scans. The door is magnetically sealed from the inside. You will not be disturbed,” he stated, the words both a promise and a warning. “Payment.” Elara handed him the wad of cash. Kaelen’s thin fingers accepted it, counting it with a speed and dexterity that was mesmerising. He gave a sharp, satisfied nod. “The rules are simple. No guests. No unregistered weapons. No transmissions of any kind. You need something, you leave a request on the terminal. I will procure it, for a fee. Your troubles are your own. Don’t make them mine.” He did not wait for an answer. He simply turned and walked away, his spindly form disappearing back towards the entrance, leaving them alone in the quiet, sterile hallway.

They stepped inside their new sanctuary and the door slid shut behind them. Elara immediately hit the magnetic lock control. A series of heavy, echoing thuds resonated through the small room as massive bolts slid into place. They were sealed in. They were safe. The moment the final lock engaged, the last of Elara’s adrenaline-fueled strength deserted her. The artificial numbness in her ankle vanished, and the pain returned with a vengeance, a white-hot, blinding agony that shot up her entire leg. Her knee buckled. With a sharp cry, she collapsed, her shoulder hitting the wall hard as she slid down to the floor, her face pale and beaded with sweat. At the same moment, Maya, whose body had been running on pure, terrified reflex for what felt like a lifetime, simply gave out. The reality of their situation—the ship, the station, the insectoid landlord—crashed down on her. She sank to the floor, her back against the sealed door, and wrapped her arms around her knees, her body wracked with silent, convulsive sobs.

The room was as spartan as the hallway: two simple bunks built into the wall, a small table, and a sealed sanitation unit. But it was clean, it was quiet, and it was safe. For several minutes, the only sound was Maya’s ragged, choked breathing and Elara’s pained, shallow gasps. Finally, Maya’s sobs subsided into a series of shuddering breaths. She lifted her head, her face blotchy and tear-streaked, and saw Elara slumped against the opposite wall, her eyes squeezed shut in pain. The sight cut through her own fear and exhaustion. She pushed herself to her feet, her limbs feeling heavy and uncooperative, and staggered over to the small sink in the corner. She found a single, clean metal cup, filled it with filtered water, and brought it to Elara. She knelt, holding the cup to her friend’s lips. “Drink,” she whispered, her voice hoarse.

Elara took a few sips, the cool water a small blessing. She leaned her head back against the wall, her breathing evening out slightly. “The medpac… it was a temporary fix,” she rasped, her voice strained. “It burned through its cycle.” Maya gently lifted Elara’s leg, propping the injured ankle on her lap to examine it. It was swollen and badly discoloured, an angry purple and blue. The sight of Elara’s genuine, physical vulnerability was a strange and powerful shock. All this time, even in her fear, a part of Maya had seen Elara as something more than human, a magical protector who could bend the world to her will. But here, in this quiet, sealed room, she was just a girl, injured and exhausted, a long, long way from home. A fierce, protective instinct Maya didn’t know she possessed surged through her. She was no Jedi, she couldn’t float chairs or heal wounds with a touch, but she could do this. She could be the anchor. She could be the one to guard the door while the warrior rested.## Chapter 10

The fierce, protective instinct that surged through Maya was a clarifying fire, burning away the last wisps of her own terror. Her fear for Elara was a solid, tangible thing, far more manageable than the abstract, existential dread that had been hollowing her out. She laid Elara’s injured leg out as straight as she could on the bunk, her touch surprisingly gentle. The medpac, a testament to Jax’s cynical but thorough professionalism, lay open on the floor. It was a miniature pharmacy of alien technology, its contents labelled in a blocky, unfamiliar script. Maya picked up a flat, silver canister, her brow furrowed in concentration. It looked like a can of spray plaster from a nightmare, but the small diagram etched beside the script showed it being applied to a wounded limb, followed by a depiction of cellular regeneration. It was their best hope.

“Okay, this is going to be another fun one,” Maya said, her voice a strained imitation of battlefield cheerfulness. “The pictures suggest this is spray-on skin. Ready?” Elara, her face pale and slick with sweat, gave a weak, shallow nod. With a hiss, a fine, silvery mist sprayed from the canister, coating Elara’s swollen and discoloured ankle. It solidified almost instantly into a flexible, semi-translucent membrane that clung to her skin like a second, more perfect epidermis. Elara’s pained gasp was sharp, but it quickly subsided into a low groan of relief as the synth-skin seemed to cool and compress the inflamed tissue beneath. Next, Maya took one of the thick, gelatinous patches, peeling away its sterile backing to reveal a translucent film humming with a faint, internal blue light. A bacta patch. Even Maya, whose galactic knowledge began and ended a few days ago, had heard whispers of the legendary healing substance from Elara’s stories. She carefully applied it over the synth-skin, and the blue light brightened for a moment before sinking into Elara’s skin, a visible infusion of regenerative power.

With the immediate medical crisis managed, a profound, bone-deep weariness settled over Elara. The pain was muted, insulated by layers of alien medicine, and her body’s desperate need for rest was becoming overwhelming. “Maya,” she whispered, her voice barely audible, her eyes fluttering closed. “I need… to rest. Deeply. It’s the only way the healing will hold. Don’t… don’t open the door. For anyone.” She wasn’t just talking about sleep. Her consciousness was already receding, sinking away from the surface of her mind, seeking the deep, quiet waters of a Jedi healing trance. Her breathing became slow and profoundly regular, her presence in the Force shrinking until it was a tiny, banked coal, almost indistinguishable from the background hum of the station. She was there, but she was also gone, retreated to a place where Maya could not follow.

For the first time, Maya was truly alone. She sat on the edge of the other bunk, the silence of the room a stark contrast to the thrumming, chaotic life she knew was just on the other side of the door. The adrenaline was gone, leaving a hollow, shaky feeling in her limbs. She was the sole guardian, the only one awake and responsible for their continued survival. Her gaze fell on the small, dark screen of the terminal set into the wall beside the door. Kaelen’s words came back to her: *You need something, you leave a request on the terminal. I will procure it, for a fee.* With a new sense of purpose, she stood up and approached it. The screen shimmered to life at her touch, displaying a simple, text-based interface in the same blocky script as the medpac. But below it, a small icon of a stylized globe offered a language selection. She found a script that was a close cousin to modern English, an archaic form of Galactic Basic, and the text resolved into something she could read.

The options were stark and utilitarian. ‘Rations (Standard Cycle)’, ‘Water (Purified)’, ‘Atmospheric Sealant’, ‘Power Cell (Universal)’. It was a menu for survival, not for comfort. But under a sub-menu labelled ‘Sustenance - Premium’, a new world of possibilities opened up. ‘Dried Gorak Meat’, ‘Dehydrated Scrimp Broth’, ‘Irradiated Root Vegetables’, ‘Synth-ale’. The prices were listed in credits, a currency that felt as abstract as floating chairs had a week ago. But the bag of cash in her pocket was real enough. She knew they needed to conserve their funds, but the thought of another gritty, tasteless protein paste was more than she could bear. It was a small rebellion, a tiny act of reclaiming their humanity in this sterile metal box. She selected the broth and two portions of the root vegetables. The terminal asked for payment. A small slot opened below the screen, glowing with a soft green light. Hesitantly, she took one of the strange, unfamiliar sterling notes from her pocket and fed it into the slot. The machine whirred, scanned the note, and displayed a new number on the screen: ‘CREDIT: 12’. The meal cost four. Her remaining balance was eight. A moment later, a section of the wall beside the terminal slid open with a soft hiss, revealing a heated compartment. Inside sat a steaming bowl of reddish-brown broth and two vacuum-sealed packets containing what looked like pale, lumpy carrots.

The smell of the hot broth, spicy and savoury, was the best thing Maya had ever smelled in her life. It was real food. It was warmth and flavour and comfort. She carried the bowl over to her bunk, sitting cross-legged, cradling its warmth in her hands. She ate slowly, every spoonful a small, profound miracle. It wasn’t delicious by the standards of her old life, but it was hot and nourishing, and it chased away some of the deep, chilling cold that had settled in her bones. She saved the other portion of vegetables and broth for Elara, placing them in the compartment to keep them warm. As she ate, the reality of their situation settled in, not as a wave of terror, but as a series of facts. They had a room. They had a way to get food. They had a small amount of a currency she was beginning to understand. Elara was healing. They were alive. It wasn't a life, not yet, but it was a foundation, a single, solid piece of ground in the middle of a raging sea.

The cycle passed. Maya dozed in fitful, anxious bursts, her ears attuned to the slightest sound from the corridor, but there was nothing but the profound, humming silence of Kaelen’s establishment. When she wasn't sleeping, she studied the terminal, learning its sub-menus, familiarizing herself with the cost of living on Shanti’s Drift. A new power cell for a personal datapad was 10 credits. A simple change of clothes was 25. A blaster pistol, listed under ‘Industrial Equipment’, was 350. The price of safety and violence, laid out in a simple, transactional list. She spent the time cleaning their few belongings, re-folding the clothes, taking stock of the medpac supplies. They were mundane tasks, but they were an anchor, a way of imposing a small, familiar order on an overwhelmingly chaotic new world. She was no longer just reacting. She was adapting.

On the second cycle, Elara stirred. Her eyes opened, no longer clouded with pain but clear and lucid. She looked at Maya, who was sitting on the floor, cleaning the grime from her own worn boots with a corner of the towel. A faint, real smile touched Elara’s lips. “Looks like you’ve been busy,” she said, her voice still weak but much stronger than before. “Someone had to take charge,” Maya replied, trying for a lightness she didn’t quite feel. “You’ve had a nice long nap. How’s the landing gear?” Elara sat up, swinging her legs over the side of the bunk. She flexed her ankle. The swelling had gone down dramatically, the angry purple fading to a mottled yellow-green. She stood, putting her full weight on it. She was still stiff, her balance not quite right, but the searing pain was gone, replaced by a dull, deep ache. “Better,” she said, a note of wonder in her voice. “Much better. The trance… it helped speed the bacta’s work.” She looked around the small, tidy room, at the empty food containers, at Maya’s resolute, weary face. She saw not a victim, but a partner. “Thank you, May.”

“Don’t thank me yet,” Maya said, getting to her feet. “I spent eight of our credits on soup. But it was worth it.” She retrieved the other meal from the heated compartment and handed it to Elara. “Eat. Then we need a real plan. Because I’ve studied the price list, and sitting in this room forever is not a financially viable long-term strategy.” Elara took the food, her hunger suddenly ravenous. As she ate, they talked, their voices low and serious. The dynamic had shifted. It was no longer Elara leading and Maya following. It was a council of two, a collaboration born of fire and desperation. They were battered, terrified, and trapped in a box deep inside a rock at the edge of nowhere. But they were together. And for the first time, they were ready to start fighting back.
