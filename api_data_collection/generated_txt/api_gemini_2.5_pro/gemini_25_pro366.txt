The salt was the first thing. Always. It was in the air, a fine, gritty mist that coated your tongue and worked its way into the seams of your clothes. It crusted on the windows of the beachfront café where Liam poured a hundred flat whites a day, his Bachelor of Marketing degree a bitter joke curled up in a cardboard tube under his bed. The glare off the Coral Sea was a physical force, a relentless, shimmering sheet of white that made you squint your life away. Some people called it paradise. To Liam, it was a beautiful cage. A waiting room with a spectacular view.

His phone lay face up on the stainless-steel counter, next to a slurry of spilled milk and coffee grounds. It hadn’t buzzed, chirped, or otherwise acknowledged its own existence in the past hour, an hour during which Liam had mentally replayed his final audition performance at least fifty times. He’d sung ‘Hallelujah’, a choice his mate Jake had called ‘braver than a one-legged man in an arse-kicking contest’. The judges had stood up. Even the hard-faced one, the one who looked like his soul had been surgically replaced with a lump of coal, had cracked a smile that was less a smile and more a brief, terrifying glimpse of his dental work. They’d loved him. They’d said he had a voice that could ‘heal the sick and raise the dead’. But that was a week ago. A lifetime. In the brutal, compressed reality of television, a week was an eternity. The silence from Sydney was a growing, monstrous thing.

“Oi, dreamer. Table four wants another one of your swamp-waters.” The voice belonged to Mel, the café owner, a woman whose face was a roadmap of every bad decision she’d ever made, most of them involving the sun and cheap cigarettes.

Liam flinched, snapping back to the hiss of the steam wand. “Coming.” He wiped the counter with a sour-smelling rag, his eyes flicking back to the phone. Nothing. The screen was a black mirror reflecting his own anxious face. Twenty-three years old, a piece of paper that said he was qualified for a life he didn’t want, and a voice that felt like a secret weapon with a faulty trigger. He’d been singing since he could talk, serenading the gulls on Mooloolaba beach, belting out tunes in the shower until the hot water ran cold. It was the only thing that felt real, the only part of him that wasn't just going through the motions. This X-Factor thing… it wasn’t just a contest. It was a jailbreak.

He frothed the milk, the high-pitched scream of the machine a decent match for the one in his own head. He poured it into the cup, his hand attempting a wobbly fern. It came out looking more like a distressed ghost. He sighed, sliding the cup onto a saucer. Another masterpiece. As he turned to take it to the table, his phone buzzed. Not a polite little notification buzz. This was a full-body, rattling convulsion against the steel.

The cup clattered back onto the counter, spilling a tidal wave of brown liquid. Mel yelled something from the kitchen. Liam didn't hear her. His heart was a frantic drum against his ribs. The screen lit up. Blocked Number. It was always a blocked number. His hand was shaking so badly he almost swiped the call away. He jammed the green icon.

“Hello?” His voice was a reedy squeak. He cleared his throat. “Hello?”

“Is this Liam Harrison?” A woman’s voice, crisp and bored, filtered through the speaker. The sound of a hundred other important calls being made in the background.

“Yes. Speaking.”

“Liam, it’s Brenda May from Syco Productions.”

The world went into slow motion. A fly buzzed lazily near the sugar packets. The clatter from the kitchen faded into a dull roar. Brenda May. He knew the name. She was the show’s puppet master, the executive producer whose name appeared in the credits for a fraction of a second but who held the fates of every hopeful in her immaculately manicured hands.

“Right. Hello,” he managed, trying to sound casual, like he got calls from TV producers every day.

“We’ve made our decision regarding the final three,” she said, her tone flat, giving nothing away. “The panel was… divided on the last spot.”

Oh, God. Here it came. The polite letdown. *Thanks for coming, you were great, just not what we’re looking for this year, feel free to queue for eight hours again next year.* He could already feel the hope draining out of him, leaving a familiar, hollow ache.

“But Simon’s a big fan of the ‘surfer-boy-with-the-voice-of-an-angel’ narrative,” she continued, the words dripping with a cynicism that could curdle milk. “It tests well with the 18-to-35 female demographic. Congratulations, Liam. You’re in the final. A car will pick you up at 0800 tomorrow. Pack for two weeks. Don’t be late.”

And then, a click. The line was dead.

Liam stood frozen, the phone still pressed to his ear, listening to the dial tone. He looked at the spilled coffee, at the fly, at the faded posters of surf competitions on the wall. Nothing had changed. And everything had. A laugh bubbled up from his chest, a strange, hysterical sound. He was in. He was in the final. He slammed the phone down on the counter and let out a whoop that rattled the sugar shakers and made the tourists at table four jump.

“What the hell is wrong with you, Harrison?” Mel screeched, poking her head out of the kitchen.

“I quit!” he yelled, a giddy, reckless grin spreading across his face. “I bloody quit!”

The flight to Sydney was a jarring transition from one world to another. He left behind a tearful, proud mother who’d pressed a hundred dollars into his hand and told him to ‘show those city slickers what a Mooloolaba boy can do’. He left behind Jake, who’d hugged him hard at the tiny Sunshine Coast airport and whispered, “Don’t come back, mate. Not until you’ve won the whole bloody thing.” He left behind the familiar, humid embrace of the coast, the smell of salt and hot pavement, the caw of gulls.

He landed in a world of grey steel, cold glass, and air that tasted of exhaust fumes and ambition. The car that picked him up was a black town car with tinted windows, the kind of vehicle he’d only ever seen in movies. He felt like an imposter, a kid in fancy dress, his worn-out jeans and surf-brand t-shirt screamingly out of place. The driver, a burly man who didn’t say a word the entire trip, dropped him outside a towering hotel in the city centre, a monolith of reflective windows that seemed to swallow the sky.

The lobby was an exercise in sterile opulence. White marble floors, chrome fixtures, art on the walls that looked expensive and meaningless. A woman with a clipboard and a headset intercepted him before he could even reach the check-in desk.

“Liam Harrison?” she asked, her smile tight and professional. “I’m Sarah, one of the production assistants. We’ve got you on floor 22. All the finalists are on the same floor. Keep you all together. Makes it easier for the camera crews.”

Camera crews. Right. He’d forgotten about that part. The constant surveillance. Life in the fishbowl.

Sarah led him to a dedicated lift, her heels clicking an efficient rhythm on the marble. “Your schedule is on the tablet in your room. Vocal coaching at ten, choreography at one, media training at three. We’re filming your ‘arrival’ segment in an hour, so get settled, maybe look a bit overwhelmed and grateful. It plays well.”

His room was bigger than his entire apartment back home. A king-sized bed with a mountain of pillows, a floor-to-ceiling window with a terrifyingly beautiful view of the sprawling city, and a bathroom that looked like it had been stolen from a design magazine. On the bed lay a pile of new clothes—branded tracksuits, t-shirts, and a hoodie, all with the X-Factor logo emblazoned on them. His new uniform. A part of the machine.

He was just unpacking his own meagre belongings when there was a sharp knock at the door. He opened it to find a guy leaning against the doorframe, a picture of effortless cool. He was tall, with artfully messy dark hair, teeth that were too white to be natural, and a confident smirk that seemed to be his default expression.

“Liam, right? The coastal kid?” the guy said, his voice smooth as silk. He extended a hand. “Rex Vance. Great to finally meet the competition.”

Liam shook his hand. Rex’s grip was firm, practiced. A salesman’s handshake. “Yeah, that’s me. Good to meet you, too.” He recognised him from the audition shows. Rex was the Sydney native, the one with the slick pop-R&B style and the sob story about a sick grandmother that Liam suspected was at least 50% fabricated for the cameras.

“Heard your audition,” Rex continued, his eyes scanning Liam’s room, taking in the cheap duffel bag and worn guitar case. “That whole raw, emotional thing. Smart angle. Very authentic.” The way he said ‘authentic’ made it sound like a carefully chosen marketing strategy. “Me, I’m more about the performance. The spectacle. People want a star, you know? Not just a voice.” He clapped Liam on the shoulder, a gesture that was meant to seem friendly but felt more like a sizing-up. “Anyway, welcome to the snake pit. Just remember, there’s only one crown.” He winked, then sauntered off down the hallway, leaving Liam with a faint, unsettling feeling, like he’d just been pleasantly threatened.

A moment later, a smaller, much more flustered figure appeared in the doorway. It was Chloe, the sixteen-year-old country girl from Tamworth with the powerhouse voice and the stage fright so bad she almost fainted during her first audition.

“Oh, hi,” she said, clutching a notebook to her chest. “Was that Rex?”

“The one and only,” Liam said with a wry smile.

“He told me my ‘farm-girl charm’ was a real asset but that I needed to work on my 'brand synergy',” she said, her brow furrowed in confusion. “I don’t even know what that means.”

“I don’t think he does either,” Liam laughed, and for the first time since landing, he felt a genuine sense of connection. Chloe’s bewildered honesty was a welcome antidote to Rex’s polished insincerity.

“Your view is amazing,” she said, peering past him into the room. “All I can see is a brick wall and a pipe.”

“Yeah, it’s… a lot,” he said, looking out at the endless grid of lights and concrete. The city stretched out below them, a vast, glittering, indifferent beast. It was a long way from the gentle curve of Mooloolaba bay. He felt a pang of homesickness, sharp and sudden. He thought of his mum, probably just finishing her shift, wiping down the sticky tables at the surf club. He thought of the familiar constellations he could see from his bedroom window. Out here, the city lights bleached the sky, erasing the stars. He was in the final. It was everything he’d ever wanted. And he had never felt more alone. He took a deep breath, the refrigerated air stinging his lungs. He had to win. There was no going back now.The brief moment of camaraderie with Chloe was a small, floating piece of driftwood in a vast and overwhelming ocean. They talked for a few minutes in the hallway, their voices hushed, conspiratorial. She told him about her family’s sheep farm, the pre-dawn starts, and how singing to the hills was the only way to make the loneliness bearable. He told her about the endless horizon of the Coral Sea, the rhythm of the tides, and the feeling of singing with a lungful of salt air. They were from opposite ends of the country, from landscapes that couldn't be more different, yet they recognised in each other the same fundamental truth: they were singers, not performers. They were voices trapped in ordinary lives, now suddenly thrust into an extraordinary, terrifying spotlight.

Their quiet conversation was shattered by the return of Sarah, the PA, who clapped her hands together with a brisk, cheerless efficiency. “Alright, lovebirds, time to make the magic happen. Liam, you’re first. We’re doing your arrival shot. We’ll get you walking down the hallway, looking awestruck, then you’ll enter your room and be, you know, blown away by the view. We’ve already got B-roll of you looking pensively out the window.” Liam stared at her. B-roll? They had been filming him already? He felt a prickle of violation, the unnerving sense that his life was no longer his own, but a collection of clips to be edited together for maximum emotional impact.

The next hour was one of the most surreal of his life. A two-man camera crew, a sound guy with a long, furry boom mic, and a director named Gaz who wore a backwards baseball cap and spoke in a stream of baffling industry jargon, crowded into the hallway. "Okay, Liam, mate, action!" Gaz commanded. "Walk towards me. Slow it down. Think 'kid in a candy store'. Your whole life has led to this moment. More wonder! Give me more wonder!" Liam tried to look wondrous. He felt like a complete idiot, acutely aware of Rex leaning against his own doorway down the hall, watching the whole charade with an amused smirk. "Cut!" Gaz yelled. "A bit wooden, mate. Let's go again. This time, as you walk, I want you to touch the wall, like you can't believe it's real. Feel the texture. Connect with the space." Liam touched the wall. It felt like a wall.

After four takes of him walking down a hallway, they moved into his room. “Okay, now the window,” Gaz directed. “Go to the window, look out, and just… react. Give me that ‘Wow, a simple boy from a small town overwhelmed by the big city’ vibe. That's your narrative. Stick to it.” Liam looked out the window. It was the same view he’d been looking at for the last hour. He tried to dredge up the initial awe, but all he felt was a hollow sense of fakery. “Can you maybe say something?” Gaz prompted. “‘Wow’, or ‘This is insane’, something organic.” Liam took a breath. “Wow,” he said, his voice flat. “This is insane.” Rex, still watching from the hall, let out a soft chuckle. The director sighed. “We’ll fix it in post.”

Vocal coaching was a relief, a return to solid ground. The coach was a woman in her late sixties named Eleanor Vance, whose stern expression and severe grey bun did little to hide the sharp intelligence in her eyes. She wasn’t affiliated with the show, but was a legendary figure in the Sydney music scene, a guru who had trained opera singers and rock stars alike. The studio was a small, soundproofed room, free of cameras and production assistants. It felt like a sanctuary.

Eleanor didn't waste time with pleasantries. “Alright, Mr. Harrison. The producers are selling you as the raw, untamed talent. Let’s see if there’s any truth in the marketing. Give me a major scale. A cappella.” Liam, relieved to be doing the one thing he was confident in, sang. The notes filled the small room, clear and strong. Eleanor closed her eyes, listening not just to the pitch but to the texture, the breath, the intent behind the sound. She had him run through arpeggios, test the top and bottom of his range, and sing passages in different volumes. She didn't praise him. She just listened, her expression unreadable.

“You’ve never had a lesson in your life, have you?” she finally stated, opening her eyes. “No,” Liam admitted, a knot of anxiety tightening in his stomach. “It shows,” she said, and his heart sank. “Your technique is a mess. You’re singing from your throat on your high notes, your breath support is inconsistent, and you hold tension in your jaw. In six months of a heavy performance schedule, you’d tear your vocal cords to shreds.” She paused, letting the clinical assessment hang in the air. “But,” she continued, a flicker of something new in her gaze, “you have something I can’t teach. It’s a rare quality. A direct line from your heart to your voice. There’s no filter. No artifice. It’s honest. That’s why they stood up. Don’t ever let them train that out of you.” She then spent the next hour giving him a series of breathing exercises, tools not to change his voice, but to protect it. It was the first time all day anyone had spoken to him about something real.

The feeling of groundedness evaporated the moment he stepped into the dance studio. It was a vast, mirror-walled room, bright and intimidating. The choreographer, a man named Rico who was impossibly lean and vibrated with a hummingbird’s energy, was leading Rex and Chloe through a series of sharp, complex moves. Rex moved with a lazy, practiced grace, every step hitting the beat perfectly. He was born for this. Chloe, on the other hand, was a mess of flailing limbs and frantic concentration, her face a mask of pure panic. Liam felt a surge of sympathetic terror.

“Ah, the surfer has arrived!” Rico trilled, clapping his hands. “Let’s see if you have more rhythm than a bucket of sand. Five, six, seven, eight!” He launched into a sequence of steps, pivots, and arm gestures that made Liam’s brain short-circuit. He stumbled, turned the wrong way, and nearly collided with a flushed and mortified Chloe. Rex, without missing a beat, glided around him, a look of pitying amusement on his face. "It's about selling it, man," Rex offered, not unkindly, as they took a water break. "Even if you mess up the steps, you just have to look like you meant to do it. Confidence is its own choreography." Liam nodded, wiping sweat from his brow, but the advice didn't help. He wasn't an actor. He couldn't just "sell it." He was a singer who stood still. Here, in this room of mirrors reflecting his every clumsy failure, he felt like a fraud all over again. The voice that could ‘heal the sick and raise the dead’ was useless if he couldn’t even master a simple two-step.The brief moment of camaraderie with Chloe was a small, floating piece of driftwood in a vast and overwhelming ocean.

Here, in this room of mirrors reflecting his every clumsy failure, he felt like a fraud all over again. The voice that could ‘heal the sick and raise the dead’ was useless if he couldn’t even master a simple two-step.

The media training session was held in a bland, windowless conference room that smelled of stale air conditioning and corporate desperation. The trainer, a woman named Diana with aggressively red lipstick and a blazer with shoulders so sharp they could cut glass, paced in front of them like a panther sizing up three very clumsy mice. She wielded a whiteboard marker like a weapon.

“Your story is your brand,” she announced, her voice so crisp it seemed to have been ironed. “And your brand is your product. We are not selling a voice. We are selling a feeling, an aspiration, a narrative. You are no longer people; you are concepts. Got it?” Chloe looked like she was about to cry. Rex leaned back in his chair, looking bored, as if this was all remedial work for him. Liam felt a familiar sense of dread.

Diana turned to Chloe first. “Chloe. You are ‘The Humble Farm Girl’. Every answer you give filters through that lens. They ask you about the pressure? You compare it to lambing season. They ask about the city? You talk about how you miss the stars. Never, ever say you want to win. You’re just ‘so grateful for the opportunity to share your music’.” She scribbled ‘HUMBLE. GRATEFUL. FARM.’ on the whiteboard.

Next, she pivoted to Rex. “Rex. You are ‘The Prodigal Son’. You’ve had a taste of the industry, you’ve been knocked down, but now you’re back, more polished, more determined. You’re the professional. Confident, but with a hint of a hidden wound—the grandmother story is gold, use it. Your brand is ‘Redemption and Polish’.” She wrote ‘POLISHED. DRIVEN. REDEMPTION.’ next to his name. Rex gave a small, self-satisfied nod.

Finally, her laser-like gaze fell on Liam. “And you. The ‘Surfer-Boy-Saviour’. The raw talent plucked from obscurity. You are the diamond in the rough.” She circled Liam’s name on the board. “Your narrative is ‘Authenticity’. You are pure, untainted by the industry. You’re not here for the fame, you’re here for the music. It’s all about the *feeling*, Liam. When a journalist asks you a question, I want you to look slightly pained, like you’re dredging the answer up from the very depths of your soul.” She paused, tapping the marker against her chin. “And for God’s sake, stop saying ‘um’. It’s not authentic, it’s just amateur. Replace it with a thoughtful pause.” She wrote ‘AUTHENTIC. SOULFUL. RAW.’ on the board.

The session descended into a painful role-play. Diana fired mock interview questions at them. Rex was flawless, weaving his narrative into every answer with practiced ease. Chloe stumbled, her genuine shyness coming across as exactly what Diana wanted. When Diana asked Liam what his biggest weakness was, he answered honestly. “Choreography. I can’t dance to save my life.” Diana’s red lips tightened. “No. Wrong. Your biggest weakness is that you sometimes care *too much*. You get so lost in the emotion of the song that you forget everything else. See the difference? One makes you sound clumsy, the other makes you sound like a tortured artist.” Liam felt a piece of himself shrivel up and die. This wasn’t a jailbreak; it was just a different kind of cage, one with prettier bars and a much bigger audience.

That evening, the three of them were summoned to a suite on the top floor, a vast, impersonal space with panoramic views of the glittering city lights. Brenda May, the executive producer, was waiting for them. She was flanked by Gaz, the director, and a handful of other serious-looking people in dark suits. The air crackled with a forced, high-stakes energy. This was a scene for the show. A camera crew lurked in the corner, capturing their every nervous glance.

“Welcome, finalists,” Brenda said, her voice smooth and vaguely menacing. “The hard work starts now. Each week, one of you will be going home. Your first live show is in six days. The theme…” she paused for dramatic effect, her eyes sweeping over them, “is ‘Guilty Pleasures’.” A low groan escaped Chloe. Rex smirked; this was his territory. Liam’s mind went blank. What was his guilty pleasure? Listening to his mum's ABBA Gold CD?

Brenda handed each of them a sealed manila envelope. “Your songs have been chosen for you. Chosen to showcase your strengths and, in some cases, to test your limits. Your journey starts with this song. Don’t screw it up.” Her smile didn't reach her eyes. They were dismissed. Back in the hallway, the temporary truce of media training was gone. They were competitors again, each clutching a potential lifeline or a death sentence.

Chloe tore hers open immediately, her face falling as she read the paper inside. "Oh, no," she whispered, looking horrified. "They've given me 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' by The Darkness." The thought of the shy country girl attempting the falsetto screech and glam-rock swagger of the song was both tragic and absurd. Rex opened his with a flourish. He laughed, a short, sharp bark of triumph. "Perfect. 'Toxic' by Britney Spears. The stripped-back, acoustic version, of course. Sexy. Dark. Very on-brand." He winked at Liam. "What'd they stick you with, beach boy? Something by Jack Johnson?"

Liam’s hands felt clammy as he unsealed the envelope. He pulled out the single sheet of paper. His eyes scanned the title and his blood ran cold. It wasn’t a soulful ballad. It wasn’t a classic rock anthem he could belt out. It was a song he knew, a song everyone knew, but one he would never have chosen in a million years. Printed in bold, black letters were the words: ‘Call Me Maybe’ by Carly Rae Jepsen. He stared at it, a wave of nausea rolling over him. It was a frothy, bubblegum pop song. It was everything he wasn't. It was a joke. He could feel Rex’s eyes on him, could almost hear the un-spoken mockery. They weren’t looking for a diamond in the rough. They were looking for a clown.

He escaped to his room, the piece of paper feeling like a condemnation in his hand. He slumped onto the edge of the ridiculously large bed, the sprawling city lights outside the window seeming to mock him with their cold, indifferent sparkle. He thought of Eleanor Vance’s words: *A direct line from your heart to your voice. Don’t ever let them train that out of you.* How was he supposed to find the heart in ‘Call Me Maybe’? It felt like a deliberate act of sabotage, a test designed to make him fail, to expose him as the one-trick pony they probably thought he was. He was the surfer boy with the soulful voice, and they’d handed him a plastic bucket and spade.

His phone buzzed on the nightstand. It was a text from his mum: *Saw the first promo on TV tonight!!! You looked so handsome. We’re all so proud of you, lovey. The whole town is behind you! XOXO*. A fresh wave of panic, mingled with a profound sense of homesickness, washed over him. The whole town. He wasn't just Liam Harrison, the barista with a dream, anymore. He was Liam Harrison, Mooloolaba's great hope. And they were going to watch him get on a national stage and completely humiliate himself. He picked up his guitar, the familiar weight of it a small comfort. He strummed a few chords, a mournful, minor-key progression. He tried to sing the opening line of the song. “I threw a wish in the well…” The words felt alien in his mouth, sugary and meaningless. He stopped, pressing his forehead against the cool wood of the guitar. He had to find a way. He had to dismantle the song, break it down to its bones and find something, anything, real inside it. If he couldn't, this dream would be over before it even began.For two days, the song was his tormentor. It followed him from the sterile hotel room to the cacophonous group rehearsals, a relentlessly cheerful earworm with vapid lyrics that felt like a personal insult. He tried to practice it, standing in front of the mirror in his room, but the words tasted like ash in his mouth. “Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy…” He sounded like he was reading a grocery list. There was no connection, no heart, no truth. It was a performance, a lie, and every time he sang it, he could feel Diana’s condescending voice in his head, praising his ‘authenticity’. He was supposed to be the soulful one, and they had handed him a piece of musical plastic.

He skipped the group dinner on the second night, feigning a headache. He couldn’t stand another minute of Rex’s preening or the production assistants’ false bonhomie. He needed to be alone. He sat on the floor of his room, his back against the bed, his old guitar across his lap. The city lights outside were a cold, distant nebula. He felt utterly lost, a million miles from the salty air and warm sand of home. He thought about quitting. The thought was a brief, sweet relief. He could be on a bus tomorrow, back to Mooloolaba, back to Mel and her sour rags and the comforting hiss of the coffee machine. Back to being a failure with a marketing degree under his bed. The relief soured instantly. Jake’s words echoed in his head: *Don’t come back, mate. Not until you’ve won.*

With a sigh of resignation, he decided to try a different approach. He wouldn’t try to sing the song. He would dissect it. He wrote the lyrics out on a piece of hotel stationery, staring at them as if they were a coded message. He ignored the melody he knew, the bouncy synth-pop arrangement that was welded to the words. What was left? A story. A simple, almost painfully vulnerable one. It wasn’t about a confident pickup line. It was about the terrifying, reckless moment of seeing something you want and throwing all your cards on the table. It was about the hope and the fear and the chance of utter humiliation. *Here’s my number. So call me, maybe.* The ‘maybe’ was the key. It was the entire song. It was the insecurity, the whispered prayer at the end of a desperate plea.

He put his fingers to the fretboard, not aiming for a familiar chord, but just searching for a sound that matched the feeling. He found a minor chord, then another, creating a progression that was melancholic and full of longing. He slowed the tempo way down, letting the space between the notes breathe. He began to sing again, not the lyrics, but the story he had found inside them. His voice was quiet, almost a whisper. “I threw a wish in the well, don’t ask me I’ll never tell…” It was no longer a flippant opening line; it was a confession. The melody he was building was sparse, haunting. It was the sound of a late-night phone call, of a heart laid bare. The ‘crazy’ in “this is crazy” wasn’t giddy; it was genuinely unhinged, the craziness of taking a huge, life-altering risk. He had taken a risk. He had stood on a stage in front of a million people and sung ‘Hallelujah’. He had quit his job, left his home, and thrown his whole life at this one, single chance. The song wasn't about a girl anymore. It was about him. It was the most authentic thing he could possibly sing.

The next morning, he booked an extra session with Eleanor Vance, using the excuse that he was struggling with his breath control. He walked into her sound-proofed sanctuary, his guitar case in one hand and a knot of nerves in the other. He didn’t say a word, just sat on the stool, took a deep breath, and played his version of the song. He kept his eyes closed, pouring all the frustration, the homesickness, and the flicker of defiant hope into the performance. When he sang the final “So call me, maybe?” the last word hung in the air, fragile and unresolved. He let the final chord ring out and then the silence in the room was absolute. He was terrified to open his eyes. He was sure she would hate it. That she would tell him he’d butchered a pop classic and to stick to the script.

When he finally dared to look at her, Eleanor’s severe expression was gone. In its place was a look of intense, focused curiosity, like a geologist who had just cracked open a boring rock to find a flawless crystal inside. She was quiet for a long moment, her fingers steepled under her chin. “The producers gave you that song, didn’t they?” she asked, her voice soft. Liam nodded, unable to speak. “They were testing you,” she said, a faint, knowing smile playing on her lips. “They wanted to see if you were a jukebox or an artist. They wanted to see if you’d break.” She stood up and walked over to the piano. “You held the last note a little flat. Nerves. And you need to support the breath more on the chorus, or it will sound weak, not vulnerable. But the arrangement…” she looked at him, her gaze direct and powerful. “The arrangement is why you are here. It’s honest. Now, don’t let them take it from you.”

Buoyed by Eleanor’s approval, a new kind of resolve hardened in Liam’s gut. He found Chloe later that day, huddled in a corner of the communal lounge, looking miserable. She was listening to The Darkness on her headphones, a textbook on musical theory open on her lap. “I just don’t get it,” she lamented, pulling the earbuds out. “It’s so… loud. And he’s singing about things I can’t even imagine. I feel like I’m in a costume, and it’s three sizes too big.” Liam sat down beside her. “Forget the costume,” he said, remembering his own breakthrough. “What’s the song about, really?” Chloe looked confused. “I dunno… a thing called love?” she offered weakly. “No, underneath that,” Liam pressed. “It’s about being so completely overwhelmed by a feeling that it’s all you can think about. It’s totally over the top and a bit ridiculous, right? Have you ever felt that way about something?” Her eyes lit up with sudden understanding. “Singing,” she whispered. “When I get on a stage and it’s going well… it feels like that. Like I could fly.” Liam smiled. “So don’t sing his story. Sing yours.”

The battle came during the first full band rehearsal. The session musicians were pros, capable of playing anything put in front of them, but they had the sheet music for the original version of ‘Call Me Maybe’. Gaz, the director, was there, along with Rico, the choreographer, who was already planning some high-energy, synchronized moves. "Alright, Liam, let's see what you've got!" Gaz called out from the control booth. "Give us some of that beach-boy charm!" Liam took a deep breath. “Actually,” he said, his voice steadier than he expected. “I’m doing a different arrangement.” He walked the bemused musical director through the new chord progression. The band started to play, hesitantly at first, then with a growing sense of interest as the mournful, folk-inflected melody took shape. Liam sang, his voice filling the studio, his version of the song silencing the usual backstage chatter.

When he finished, there was a stunned pause. Then Gaz’s voice crackled through the speakers, dripping with irritation. “What the hell was that? A funeral dirge? It’s ‘Guilty Pleasures’ week, Harrison, not ‘I’m Very Sad and Deep’ week. It’s supposed to be fun, upbeat. People are supposed to tap their feet, not call a suicide hotline.” Rico nodded in agreement. “I can’t choreograph to that. What’s he supposed to do? Stand there and look pained?” Rex, who had been watching from the side of the stage, let out a condescending laugh. "Told you, man," he said, loud enough for Liam to hear. "It's a TV show. Entertain them." The band looked at Liam, awaiting their instructions, their faces neutral. He could feel his resolve wavering. It would be so easy to give in, to sing the song they wanted, to do the stupid dance moves and just get through the week.

But then he remembered Eleanor’s face. He remembered the feeling of finding the truth in the song. And he remembered Diana, the media trainer, and her talk of his brand. He took the microphone. “Diana told me my brand was ‘Authenticity’,” he said, his voice echoing slightly in the large room, directing his words at the glass of the control booth. “She said it was all about the feeling, about being raw and soulful. Well, this is it. This is my authentic version. Singing it the other way would be a lie. And it wouldn’t be very good. This,” he said, gesturing to the band, “is the only way I can do it.” Gaz was silent for a moment. There was a frantic, muffled conversation in the booth. Liam’s heart hammered against his ribs. He had called their bluff. He had used their own manufactured nonsense against them. Finally, Gaz’s voice came back, tight with annoyance. “Fine. Whatever. Do your depressing little song. But if you get voted off, it’s on you. Don’t come crying to us.” Liam let out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. He’d won. For now.The walk back to the hotel was charged with a strange new electricity. Rex fell into step beside him, his usual smirk replaced by a look of clinical assessment. He didn't seem angry, merely… analytical. “Bold move, Harrison,” he said, his voice a low murmur, just for Liam. “Fighting the machine. Very rock and roll. Hope it pays off for you. The public doesn’t usually vote for a downer, no matter how ‘authentic’ it is. They want to forget their crappy week, not be reminded of yours.” He clapped Liam on the shoulder again, the gesture feeling less like a threat this time and more like a warning from a seasoned veteran to a naive rookie. “Good luck,” he added, and it almost sounded sincere.

Chloe, however, was practically vibrating with vicarious courage. She caught up to him in the hotel lobby, her eyes wide. “That was amazing,” she breathed, clutching her notebook like a shield. “What you did in there. You just… told them. I’ve never seen anyone talk to Gaz like that.” Liam shrugged, a flush of heat creeping up his neck. “I didn’t really have a choice,” he said. “It was either that or make a complete fool of myself.” Chloe shook her head, a flicker of an idea dawning in her expression. “No, it was a choice,” she insisted. “You chose to be good instead of obedient.” The observation hung between them, simple and profound. It was the first time Liam had thought of it that way.

The next few days were a blur of managed chaos, a crash course in the art of being a television product. They were woken at dawn by camera crews wanting to film them being ‘natural’ over breakfast. They were shuttled from wardrobe fittings, where Liam was put in a succession of artfully distressed jeans and plain, dark t-shirts, to sound checks and lighting rehearsals. Rico, the choreographer, treated Liam with theatrical disdain. “Okay, Mr. Soulful,” he’d sigh dramatically. “Your stage is there. Your stool is there. You will walk to the stool. You will sit on the stool. Try not to look like you’re waiting for a bus. That is your choreography. Thrilling.” Liam accepted the ridicule. A stool was more than he could have hoped for; it was an anchor, a small island of stillness in the hurricane of the live show.

Two days before the show, he was summoned to Brenda May’s office. The room was sleek, white, and cold, high in the sky, making him feel like he was being judged from on high. There were no cameras this time. Brenda sat behind a vast glass desk, her posture immaculate. “You were very bold at rehearsal, Liam,” she said, her voice a flat, polished stone. “It makes for good television. A contestant fighting for his art. The sensitive soul against the heartless machine. Very dramatic.” She paused, tapping a perfectly manicured finger on the glass. “But do not mistake a good story for a guaranteed spot in the final. The narrative can always be reframed. ‘The arrogant boy who got too big for his boots and was humbled by the public vote’ also tests very well. Remember that.” It was a masterclass in manipulation, a compliment wrapped around a threat. She was giving him the rope to either climb or hang himself, and making it clear she was happy to film either outcome.

The night of the live show arrived with the force of a physical blow. The backstage area was a maelstrom of frantic energy, a sensory overload of shouting stagehands, the chemical smell of hairspray, and the palpable thrum of thousands of people in the audience on the other side of the wall. Liam felt sick. He sat on a crate in a dim corner, trying to do the breathing exercises Eleanor had taught him, but the air felt too thick to draw in. He was dressed in his uniform of contrived authenticity: dark jeans, a simple grey t-shirt. He watched Rex, across the room, getting a final touch-up on his makeup. Rex was electric, thriving on the chaos, his eyes gleaming with competitive fire. He was wearing a ridiculously sharp leather jacket, the embodiment of his ‘Polished Redemption’ brand. Chloe was pacing back and forth, pale under her stage makeup, twisting the hem of the sparkly dress they’d put her in.

She saw Liam and came over, her hands freezing cold when she briefly gripped his arm. “I’m going to throw up,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “I can’t do it. A rock song? In this dress? I look like a disco ball had a fight with a scarecrow.” Liam managed a weak smile. “Hey. Just sing your story, remember? About how it feels. Forget the dress, forget the noise. Just find one person in the crowd and sing it to them.” He wasn’t sure if he was advising her or himself. She nodded, unconvinced, but the pacing stopped. A text buzzed on his phone. It was Jake. *Saw your odds online. You’re the long shot to win tonight. Prove em wrong, mate. Mooloolaba is watching.* The pressure felt like a physical weight on his chest. Long shot. Of course he was.

“Two minutes, Liam!” a PA with a headset yelled, her voice tight with stress. This was it. The walk from the relative quiet of the backstage area to the wings of the stage felt like the longest journey of his life. The roar of the audience grew from a muffled rumble to a deafening, visceral force. Bright, hot lights blinded him as he peeked around the curtain. The stage looked enormous, a vast, glittering expanse. In the center, a single stool and a microphone stand looked terrifyingly small and exposed. He saw the judges at their long, glowing desk, their faces projected onto huge screens. He saw the sea of faces in the audience, a shifting, anonymous mass. Gaz was right. It was a party. And he was about to sing a funeral dirge. The jaunty, upbeat theme music for the show blasted through the speakers, and a wave of pure, undiluted panic washed over him. *What have I done?* he thought, his blood turning to ice. *Rex was right. They want to be entertained, not depressed. I’m going to crash and burn in front of the entire country.*

The show’s host, a man with teeth as white and perfect as Rex’s, was bellowing his introduction. “…plucked from a sleepy surf town, with a voice that stunned the nation! The judges said he was the real deal, but with a controversial song choice, has he gambled too much, too soon? Please welcome… Liam Harrison!” The roar of the crowd was a physical impact. A stagehand gave him a shove. “Go, go, go!” And he was walking, his legs feeling like they belonged to someone else. He didn’t dare look at the audience, keeping his eyes fixed on the stool. He clutched his guitar, the wood of the neck slick with sweat in his palm. He reached the center of the stage, sat down, and adjusted the microphone. The lights were hot, the silence after the applause deafening. He could hear the blood pounding in his ears.

He took a breath. And then another, deeper one, remembering Eleanor. *Support the breath.* He looked up, past the blinding lights, into the vast darkness where the audience sat. He couldn't see them, but he could feel them. He wasn't thinking about the votes, or the judges, or Brenda May’s threat. He thought of the café, of the endless, beautiful cage. He thought of the phone call that had changed his life. This was his jailbreak. This was the moment. He found his first chord, the melancholic minor sound cutting through the charged silence. He began to sing, his voice quieter than anyone expected. “I threw a wish in the well…”

At first, the room was confused. There were scattered whispers, a sense of anticlimax. This wasn't the song they knew. But Liam kept his eyes shut, retreating into the story he had built. He sang of the vulnerability, the desperate hope, the gut-wrenching fear of rejection. The arrangement built slowly, his voice swelling from a near-whisper on the verses to a full, aching cry on the chorus. He wasn't performing. He was testifying. As he reached the final, stripped-back line, "So call me, maybe?", he opened his eyes, letting his gaze fall on the judges’ table. He sang the last word not as a flippant invitation, but as a fragile question mark, his voice trailing off into the vast, silent arena. For a full three seconds after the last chord faded, there was nothing. No sound. Just the hum of the lights and the collective held breath of two thousand people. Liam’s heart stopped. He had failed. And then, the room exploded. It wasn't just polite applause; it was a roar, a standing ovation that washed over him in a wave of sound and emotion. People were on their feet, some were even wiping their eyes. The hard-faced judge, the one with the soul of coal, was standing, his hands clasped together, nodding slowly, a look of profound shock and respect on his face. Liam looked out, dazed, and saw that the host, the PA’s, even the camera operators were clapping. He had done it. He had taken the most disposable piece of pop music imaginable and turned it into a moment of art. He had made them listen.The silence stretched for an eternity, a vacuum in which Liam’s entire future seemed to hang. He sat frozen on the stool, the warmth of the lights turning his skin clammy, the ghost of the final chord still vibrating through the wood of his guitar. And then the sound hit him. It wasn't a clap; it was a detonation, a tidal wave of noise that seemed to lift him from the stool. It was the sound of thousands of people getting to their feet, their applause a raw, unified roar. He looked up, blinking against the glare, and saw the impossible: the entire arena, a churning sea of cheering silhouettes, was standing for him. For his sad, broken little version of a bubblegum pop song.

The host, a man usually composed of witty segues and flawless smiles, looked genuinely stunned. He let the applause thunder for a moment longer before stepping forward, his voice filled with a new, unscripted respect. "Wow," he said, the single word amplified to fill the cavernous space. "Just... wow." He turned to the judges' table. "Marcus? I don't think I've ever seen this room react like that." The camera zoomed in on the hard-faced judge, the man Liam had privately nicknamed ‘The Undertaker’. Marcus leaned into his microphone, his expression severe, but his eyes held a flicker of something that looked like awe. "I'll be honest, Liam," he began, his gravelly voice silencing the room. "When I saw your song choice on my sheet, I wrote you off. I thought it was arrogant, or stupid, or both. I was sharpening my knives." He paused, letting the tension build. "I have never been so happy to be so wrong. What you did tonight wasn't a cover. It was an autopsy. You ripped the chest open on a manufactured, plastic song and found a real, beating, broken heart. That wasn't a performance; it was a confession. That was artistry."

The other judges were a chorus of ecstatic praise. They lauded his bravery, his musical intelligence, his vulnerability. Words like ‘game-changer’ and ‘defining moment’ were thrown around like confetti. Liam could barely process them. He mumbled his thanks, his brain a static-filled haze, and stumbled off the stage into the wings, his guitar feeling impossibly heavy. The moment he was out of sight, the world shifted. The production assistant who had yelled at him to ‘go’ now handed him a bottle of water with a reverence usually reserved for visiting royalty. Crew members he’d never spoken to gave him solemn nods and pats on the back. He had walked onto that stage as a contestant. He walked off as a contender.

He found Chloe in the buzzing chaos of the green room. She was next. Her face was pale, a mixture of terror and sheer, unadulterated awe. “Liam,” she whispered, grabbing his arm. “How… how am I supposed to follow that?” Her sparkly dress seemed to mock her fear. He looked at her, seeing his own panic from thirty minutes ago reflected in her wide eyes. "You don't follow it," he said, his voice hoarse. "You do what we talked about. You sing your story. Not his, not mine. Yours." He squeezed her hand. "You told me it feels like you could fly. So fly." A PA called her name. She gave Liam one last, terrified look, took a deep breath that seemed to pull in all the courage in the room, and walked towards the stage.

Liam watched on a monitor, his own heart pounding a frantic rhythm for her. She walked out, looking small and fragile under the huge lights. When the opening chords of the raucous rock song began, she flinched. She sang the first verse, her voice tight and reedy, her eyes squeezed shut. Liam’s stomach clenched. She was going to crash. Then, as the first chorus hit, something shifted. She opened her eyes, not looking at the judges or the cameras, but up towards the cheap seats in the back. A different energy took over. She wasn’t trying to be a swaggering rock star anymore. She was the girl from the hills, singing her heart out. The song became a joyful, defiant roar, a country-rock explosion of pure, unbridled passion. She transformed the swagger into exuberance, the screech into a joyful yodel of release. By the end, she was beaming, the sparkly dress no longer a costume but a beacon, and the crowd, caught up in her infectious joy, gave her an ovation almost as loud as Liam’s.

Rex was the last of their trio to perform. He had watched both Liam’s and Chloe’s triumphs on the monitor, his confident smirk slowly tightening into a rigid line. The two raw, authentic acts had completely reset the emotional temperature of the room. He was the consummate professional, but for the first time, that felt like a liability. He strode onto the stage, a vision of urban cool in his leather jacket, and launched into his version of ‘Toxic’. It was, by any technical measure, perfect. His voice was flawless, his intricate guitar work was impressive, and his stage presence was magnetic. He oozed star quality. The performance was sleek, seductive, and intensely rehearsed. But it felt like watching a beautiful, expensive car drive by behind a pane of glass. You could admire the craftsmanship, but you couldn't feel the engine.

The judges’ comments reflected the subtle shift. They praised him, but the language was different. They used words like ‘polished’, ‘professional’, and ‘marketable’. Marcus, The Undertaker, nodded thoughtfully. "Rex, you're a star. There's no question. You look like one, you sound like one, you perform like one. It was a ten out of ten performance." He paused. "But tonight, I'm not sure a ten was enough." The comment, though couched in praise, landed like a stone. Rex’s smile didn’t falter, but a flicker of something cold and furious entered his eyes. He had done everything right, and somehow, he had been outmanoeuvred by a sad-sack surfer and a star-struck farm girl.

An hour later, all twelve finalists were lined up on stage. The air was thick with the cheap perfume of manufactured tension. Liam stood between Chloe and Rex, a bizarre island of shared experience. Chloe was trembling slightly, but a new steeliness was in her gaze. Rex stood perfectly still, his face a mask of cool indifference, but Liam could see the muscle jumping in his jaw. The host began the ritual, announcing the names of those who were safe, one by one. The relief on each face was stark and immediate. Liam’s name was the third one called. A wave of dizziness washed over him as he let out the breath he’d been holding. The host said his name again, reminding him to step forward. He did, catching Chloe’s eye. She gave him a tiny, proud smile. Her name was called two announcements later. She visibly sagged with relief, and her hand found his for a brief, grateful squeeze.

The line of contestants thinned. Soon, there were only four left, standing in a small, miserable huddle under the glare of the lights. And Rex was one of them. The front-runner, the professional, the one who was meant to be untouchable, was in the bottom four. The host milked the moment, his voice a dramatic purr as he announced the next person safe. It wasn’t Rex. Liam watched his competitor’s face. The mask was cracking. The cool confidence had evaporated, replaced by a raw, naked humiliation. This wasn't part of his brand. This wasn't in his narrative. This was real. Finally, with only two contestants left, the host called the name of the person going home. It wasn’t Rex. The girl beside him burst into tears as her dream ended on national television. Rex was safe. But as he walked, stiff-backed, to join the others, he looked utterly defeated. The crowd had voted, and their message was clear. Polish was good. Professionalism was admirable. But tonight, they had voted for heart. And Rex Vance, for all his talent, had been found wanting.The comedown was slower and stranger than the ascent. Back in the green room, a chaotic space now stratified by the invisible lines of success and failure, Liam was no longer just a contestant. He was an event. People who had looked through him hours earlier now sought his eye, offering tight, professional smiles and murmurs of "killer performance." Sarah, the PA, who had previously herded him like livestock, now asked if he needed anything with a deferential tilt of her head. He was handed a tablet showing the overnight social media metrics. His name was trending nationally. The clip of his performance was rocketing towards a million views. It was all abstract, a series of numbers and graphs that had no connection to the shaking in his hands or the hollow, echoing space in his chest where the panic used to be.

He saw Rex across the room, surrounded by his own small team of stylists and hangers-on who now looked deeply uncomfortable, unsure of the correct etiquette for consoling a star whose shine had just been demonstrably tarnished. Rex wasn't speaking to any of them. He was staring at a monitor showing a replay of his own performance, his face a mask of cold, intellectual fury. He was dissecting his failure, frame by frame, searching for the flaw in the code. As Liam watched, Rex’s eyes lifted and met his across the crowded room. There was no congratulations in that gaze. There was no anger, either. It was something far more chilling: recognition. It was the look a predator gives a rival who has just stolen its kill, an acknowledgment of a new and dangerous variable in the ecosystem. Rex gave a slow, deliberate nod, then turned and walked out, his entourage scrambling to follow in his wake.

Chloe found him a moment later, her face scrubbed of makeup, her sparkly dress exchanged for one of the generic X-Factor tracksuits. The giddy relief had been replaced by a quiet, shared sense of shock. They escaped the noise, finding refuge in a deserted corridor that smelled of disinfectant and old dust. "Did that really happen?" she whispered, leaning against the wall, the question aimed at the universe. Liam could only shake his head, the roar of the crowd still a phantom ringing in his ears. "I think so," he said. "Your song… you were incredible." She blushed, a real, un-televised blush. "I just did what you said," she admitted. "I sang my story. I thought about shearing sheep, oddly enough. The feeling of finishing the last one before a storm rolls in. That feeling of racing the clock and winning." He laughed, a real laugh, the first one that day that didn't feel choked by anxiety. In that sterile hallway, far from the cameras and the judges, they were just two singers from opposite ends of the country who had survived their first storm.

Sleep was impossible. Liam lay in his king-sized bed, the city lights painting silent, shifting patterns on the ceiling, his mind replaying every note, every word, every roar of the crowd. He was no longer the anonymous barista. He was now ‘Liam Harrison: The Artist.’ It felt like a costume he had been forced to wear, one that might be more difficult to remove than the ‘Surfer-Boy-Saviour’ tag had been. At six a.m., his phone rang. It was his mum, her voice thick with tears. “Oh, lovey,” she sobbed. “We watched it at the surf club. The whole place. When you finished, you could have heard a pin drop, and then Mel, of all people, stood up on a table and started cheering. The whole town is going absolutely bonkers. You did it, Liam. You really did it.” He closed his eyes, the simple, unvarnished pride in her voice a balm on his frayed nerves. He was doing this for them, too. The thought was both a comfort and a terrifying weight.

The shift in the machine’s attitude was immediate. The next morning, Liam was summoned not by Gaz or Sarah, but by Brenda May herself. Her office was just as he remembered, a minimalist temple of power overlooking the city. This time, however, her smile seemed almost genuine. “Congratulations, Liam,” she said, gesturing for him to sit. “You created a moment. And moments are our currency.” She leaned forward, the cynicism back in her eyes. “The network loves you. The public loves you. ‘The tortured artist who finds beauty in the trash.’ It’s a fantastic narrative. Your authenticity is rating through the roof.” The way she said ‘authenticity’ made it sound like a brand of yogurt. “So, this week, we’re going to lean into it.”

She slid a single sheet of paper across the vast glass desk. “This week’s theme is ‘Movie Night’.” Liam’s stomach tightened. He scanned the paper. It was a list of huge, iconic movie ballads. Bombastic, orchestral, emotionally manipulative songs that were the polar opposite of his sparse, intimate style. “We’ve assigned you ‘I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing’,” Brenda said, naming the Aerosmith power ballad from the movie *Armageddon*. “It’s one of the biggest-selling rock ballads of all time. The public adores it. We want you to do your thing to it. Strip it down. Make it your own. Make them cry again. Don’t disappoint us.” She smiled, a clear, sharp message in her eyes. It was not a request. He was no longer the rebel fighting the system; he was the system's new, prized racehorse, and they were pointing him at the next jump. The freedom he had fought for was already becoming a gilded cage.

He left her office feeling more confused than triumphant. He had won the right to be himself, only to be ordered to mass-produce that self on command. As he stepped out of the lift into the finalists’ lobby, Rex was there, leaning against a pillar, as if waiting for him. The cold fury from the night before was gone, replaced by a conspiratorial, almost friendly smirk. “Just had your victory meeting with the puppet master?” he asked, his voice smooth. “Let me guess. She told you how brilliant you are and that your authenticity is your superpower, and now she wants you to do it again, on cue, with some overblown piece of corporate rock.” Liam stared at him, surprised by the accuracy. Rex chuckled. “I’ve been in this business a long time, Harrison. I know how it works. They build you up, create a narrative, and then they bleed it dry. Last night, you weren’t an artist; you were a plot twist. A very effective one, I’ll admit. But what happens next week when you can’t pull another rabbit out of the hat?”

Rex pushed himself off the pillar and stepped closer, lowering his voice. “You think they want you to be authentic? They want you to be predictably authentic. They want to bottle your little sad-boy lightning and sell it. You fought them and won, and now they’ve put you in charge of your own cage. Last night was a fluke. A perfect storm of a bad song choice and a good idea. You can’t do that every week. Sooner or later, you’ll have to sing the song, do the dance. Sooner or later, you’ll have to become a professional. And I’ll be there when you do.” He patted Liam’s shoulder, the gesture now laden with a complex mix of pity and condescension, and walked away, leaving Liam reeling. The words were a poison, expertly crafted to find the cracks in his newfound confidence. *It was a fluke.* The thought burrowed deep into his mind, a seed of doubt that began to sprout immediately.

Desperate for an antidote, he found his way back to Eleanor Vance’s studio. The small, quiet room felt more like a sanctuary than ever. He explained the situation: the new song, Brenda’s directive, Rex’s insidious warning. He played her the opening chords of the Aerosmith song, his fingers fumbling, the melody feeling bloated and cartoonish. “I can’t find it,” he said, his voice laced with frustration. “There’s no ‘maybe’ in this song. There’s no vulnerability. It’s just yelling. I can’t find the truth in it.” Eleanor listened patiently, her severe expression unwavering. When he was finished, she didn’t offer comforting words. She was a teacher, not a therapist. “Of course you can’t find it,” she said bluntly. “You are looking for the same truth you found last time. You are trying to repeat a discovery. That is not art; that is manufacturing. That is what the producer wants. It is what your rival expects.”

She stood and walked to her old, upright piano. “Last week, the truth was in the insecurity. The plea. This song,” she played a few of the powerful, anthemic chords, letting them hang in the air, “is not a plea. It is a declaration. It is the opposite emotion. Its truth lies in its absolute, unwavering certainty.” She looked at Liam, her eyes sharp. “Do not try to make it small and sad. That would be a lie. It would be a gimmick. Your challenge this week is not to find the broken heart. It is to find a reason to sing with a whole one. To find something, or someone, you feel so strongly about that you could genuinely stand on a mountaintop and scream it to the world without a hint of irony.” She stopped playing. “Your authenticity is not a style, Mr. Harrison. It is not a minor key. It is the act of telling the truth with your voice. The truth simply changes from week to week. Find it.” He looked down at his hands, at his guitar, and then back at her. Rex had tried to poison him with doubt. Eleanor had just handed him the antidote: a new, far more difficult, and infinitely more honest path forward. He had to find something worth screaming for.Eleanor’s words were a compass, but Liam was still lost in the woods. For two days, he wrestled with the song, and the song, a behemoth of 90s power-rock sincerity, wrestled him back and pinned him every time. He tried to follow her advice, to search for a truth of unwavering certainty, but his life felt like a landscape of doubt. Certainty was a luxury he’d never been able to afford. He sat in his room, the branded X-Factor guitar feeling like a prop in his hands, and tried to sing the chorus. His voice came out thin and ironic, a hollow imitation of Steven Tyler’s iconic rasp. It was a joke. He sounded like a kid playing dress-up in his dad’s rock-and-roll clothes. Rex’s words slithered into his thoughts, a venomous whisper: *It was a fluke. They want you to be predictably authentic.* He was trying to do just that, to find the feeling on command, and the well was dry. The more he tried to force it, the more fraudulent he felt.

Defeated, he put the guitar down and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window. The city sprawled below, a relentless grid of ambition and indifference. He felt a pang of homesickness so sharp it was almost a physical pain. On impulse, he picked up his phone and called his mum. She answered on the second ring, the familiar sound of the surf club’s clatter in the background. She didn't talk about the show or the competition. She told him about her day. She told him that Mel had actually smiled at a customer, an event she ranked somewhere between a solar eclipse and the second coming. She told him that Jake had fixed the wobbly leg on her favourite table. She told him about the sunset she had watched after her shift, the way the sky had turned a violent, beautiful shade of orange and purple, bleeding into the deep blue of the Coral Sea. “It was one of those ones, lovey,” she said, her voice soft with the memory. “One of those ones that makes you stop what you’re doing and just… look. Makes you glad you’ve got eyes in your head.”

After he hung up, Liam stood in the silent, air-conditioned room, his mother’s words painting a vivid picture in his mind. He closed his eyes, and he wasn't in a Sydney hotel room anymore. He was standing on the headland at Mooloolaba, the salt spray cool on his face, the familiar cry of the gulls sharp in the humid air. He saw the sunset his mum had described, the vast, perfect curve of the bay, the endless shimmer of the water stretching to a horizon that held no judgment, only possibility. He felt a surge of emotion so powerful it almost buckled his knees. It wasn't love for a person. It was a fierce, primal love for a place. For home. For the feeling of the sand under his feet and the salt on his tongue. For the quiet, unassuming life he had been so desperate to escape, a life that now seemed like the only real thing in a world of chrome and mirrors. He didn’t want to miss a thing. Not a single grain of sand, not a single shade of blue in the evening tide. He never wanted to forget that feeling.

He picked up the guitar again, his fingers finding the opening chords of the song. This time, he didn't try to make them quiet or sad. He played the big, anthemic power chords as they were written, but he filled them with that feeling, that ache of fierce, protective love for his corner of the world. He started to sing, his voice no longer thin or ironic. He was not singing to a lover, begging them not to fall asleep. He was singing to his own memory, commanding it to stay. *I could stay awake just to hear you breathing* became a line about listening to the rhythm of the waves on the shore. *I don’t want to close my eyes, I don’t want to fall asleep, ‘cause I’d miss you, babe, and I don’t want to miss a thing.* It was a hymn to home. A desperate, powerful declaration that no matter how far this new life took him, he would not let it erase the boy who sang to the gulls on Mooloolaba beach. He wasn’t stripping the song down; he was building it up, giving its bombast a foundation of real, raw, heartfelt truth. Eleanor was right. He had found something worth screaming for.

The band rehearsal was a tense affair. Gaz, the director, watched from the booth with a look of impatient expectation. “Alright, Harrison, show us the magic,” his voice crackled over the intercom, dripping with sarcasm. “Let’s see the sad, stripped-down version of the stadium rock anthem. Should be a real crowd-pleaser.” Liam ignored him. He turned to the musical director, a seasoned pro named Dave, and spoke quietly for a moment. “We’re doing it as written,” he said. “Full band. Just follow me on the dynamics.” Dave raised a skeptical eyebrow but nodded to the band. They launched into the iconic opening, the sound big and full in the studio. Liam took a deep breath, closed his eyes for a second to picture that sunset, and sang.

What came out was not the angsty rasp of Steven Tyler, nor the whisper of his ‘Call Me Maybe’ performance. It was a new voice, his own voice, filled with a power and clarity that surprised everyone, including himself. He wasn’t performing rock and roll; he was leading a secular prayer. He embraced the song’s theatricality, the soaring chorus, the dramatic pauses. He wasn’t hiding behind his guitar; he was using it as a conduit for a feeling so big it couldn't be contained in a minor key. When the final, massive chorus hit, he stepped away from the microphone, his eyes open and blazing, and let his voice fill the room without amplification, a raw, desperate cry of pure emotion that was more powerful than any special effect. He held the final note until his lungs burned, the band crashing to a halt around him.

The silence that followed was different from the week before. It wasn't stunned awe; it was profound confusion. The band members looked at each other, then at Liam, their professional detachment broken by expressions of sheer shock. In the control booth, Gaz was speechless, staring at the mixing desk as if it had betrayed him. This wasn’t the product he had ordered. This wasn’t ‘Liam’s brand’. This was something else, something wilder and less predictable. And from the side of the stage, where he’d been watching with a cynical smirk, Rex Vance’s expression slowly changed. The smirk faded, the condescension evaporated. It was replaced by a look of cold, hard calculation. He had predicted Liam would fail to repeat his trick. He had been right. He just never imagined that Liam would have another, entirely different, and arguably more powerful one, up his sleeve. The coastal kid wasn't a fluke. He was a moving target.The silence that followed the final crash of the band was heavy and profound, a thick blanket laid over the studio. Liam stood panting slightly in the center of the stage, the adrenaline a high-frequency hum beneath his skin. He had given everything to the song, a full-throated, desperate declaration, and now in the echoing quiet, he felt utterly exposed. The band members exchanged wide-eyed, unreadable glances, their professional composure momentarily fractured. In the control booth, Gaz was leaning forward, his mouth slightly agape, staring not at Liam but at the glowing soundboard as if it had just recited epic poetry. The expected rebuke, the sarcastic dismissal of his choice, never came. Instead, the studio audience, which had been whipped into a frenzy by the song’s power, slowly, almost thoughtfully, got to their feet, their applause rolling towards the stage not with the explosive shock of the week before, but with the deep, rumbling power of a gathering storm.

At the judges’ table, the mood was equally transformed. The usually effervescent female judge was dabbing at the corner of her eye with a tissue, her critique a single, breathy, “Liam, that was church.” But all eyes were on Marcus. The Undertaker leaned back in his chair, his steepled fingers tapping against his lips as he regarded Liam with a new, unsettling intensity. “I am rarely surprised, Liam,” he said, his voice a low growl that commanded absolute silence. “But twice in two weeks is… unprecedented.” He leaned forward, the camera zooming in on his craggy, serious face. “Last week, you performed a magic trick. You took a piece of plastic and turned it into glass. It was clever. It was artful. This,” he gestured to the stage, “was not a trick. This was an act of raw, terrifying power. You didn’t deconstruct that song; you possessed it. You took a monument and made it a living, breathing thing. You’re not just a singer, son. You’re becoming a force of nature. And frankly, I’m not sure whether to be thrilled or terrified.”

Backstage was a blur of disorienting respect. The shift was complete. Liam was no longer the underdog, the lucky amateur who had pulled off a clever stunt. He was the front-runner, the one to beat, and the air around him had changed, charged with a mixture of awe and fear. People didn’t just look at him anymore; they watched him, as if expecting him to spontaneously combust or levitate. He found Chloe by the catering table, where she was nervously stirring a cup of tea. She had delivered a beautiful, heartfelt rendition of a Joni Mitchell song, earning warm praise and a safe passage to the next week, but she looked at Liam as if he had returned from another planet. “That wasn’t a song, Liam,” she said quietly, her eyes searching his. “That was… something else. It felt like you were going to tear the roof off the building with your voice. It’s like you’re getting further and further away from the rest of us.” Her words, meant as a compliment, landed like a small, sharp stone, reminding him of the growing distance between the person he was and the phenomenon he was becoming.

The most unnerving encounter came just before the live results show. Liam was in a quiet corner, trying to steady his breathing, when Rex appeared beside him, moving with a silent, predatory grace. The calculating fury of the week before had been replaced by a serene, almost philosophical detachment. He held two bottles of water, offering one to Liam. “An impressive display of firepower, Harrison,” Rex said, his voice a low, confidential murmur. “You’ve successfully convinced them all that you’re a prophet. The tortured voice of a generation, screaming his truth from the mountaintop.” He took a slow sip from his bottle. “But you should read your history. Prophets have a tendency to end up crucified. The public loves a martyr, but only after they’re gone.” Liam just stared at him, unsure how to respond to the bizarre, backhanded compliment.

“You see, you think you won,” Rex continued, his tone patient, as if explaining a complex theorem to a child. “But Brenda and the network won more. Last week you were a novelty. This week you’re an addiction. And they are the dealers. They’ll keep demanding more truth, more soul, a bigger piece of you every week, until there’s nothing left to give. You’re not an artist to them, you’re a natural resource to be strip-mined.” He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. “I, on the other hand, am a performer. It’s a job. I give them a polished product, a reliable return on their investment. I keep my soul in a safe deposit box where they can’t get to it. You’re laying yours out on the table every week for them to feast on. Let’s see who has more to give by the end.” Rex straightened up, his friendly mask back in place. “Just some professional advice. Good luck tonight.” With a final, chillingly pleasant smile, he walked away, leaving Liam with a mouthful of ashes and the cold, dawning horror that every word Rex had said was probably true.

The results show felt like a foregone conclusion. Liam and Chloe were waved through early, their names met with thunderous applause. The real drama swirled around the contestants in the middle of the pack, the ones who were good but not great, professional but not phenomenal. Rex, who had delivered a technically brilliant but emotionally sterile version of a classic rock song, was also declared safe, though the applause for him was noticeably more polite. He accepted it with a gracious nod, his eyes briefly meeting Liam’s with a look that said, *See? The professional survives.* The contestant who went home was a sweet, forgettable boy-band type who had simply failed to make an impression. As he sang his tearful farewell song, Liam felt a surge of empathy. The boy wasn’t a bad singer; he just hadn’t been able to give the machine the story it craved. He had been a product with no brand.

The remaining contestants were gathered on stage, exhausted and emotionally drained, when the giant screen behind them flickered to life. Brenda May’s face appeared, magnified to the size of a small car, her smile sharp and predatory. “Congratulations, finalists,” she said, her voice echoing through the studio. “You have survived another week. But the challenges will only get harder. The public expects more from you now. And so do we.” Her eyes seemed to settle on Liam. “Therefore, this week’s theme will be ‘Judges’ Choice’. Each judge will select a song for one of you. A song they feel will be the ultimate test of your artistry, your versatility, and your courage. There will be nowhere to hide.”

A nervous murmur went through the contestants. This was the ultimate act of producer manipulation, disguised as an honour. The judges began their announcements. The first judge gave Chloe a classic, heart-wrenching Patsy Cline ballad, a perfect fit for her voice that would allow her to shine. The second judge assigned Rex a complex, theatrical Queen number, a challenge that played directly to his strengths in showmanship and vocal precision. Rex accepted with a confident, almost arrogant, nod. This was his arena. Finally, all eyes turned to Marcus. He stood, his imposing figure silencing the room. He looked directly at Liam, his expression unreadable.

“Liam,” Marcus began, his voice a low rumble. “In three weeks, you have proven to be a master of reinterpretation. You deconstructed disposable pop. You reconstructed epic rock. You find new truth in unexpected places. But the greatest test for an artist is not what they can bring to a flawed song, but whether they can stand in the presence of perfection.” He paused, letting the weight of his words settle. “Can you bring your truth to a song that is already one of the most truthful ever written? A song so simple, so pure, and so iconic that it offers no room for tricks, no place to hide, and no forgiveness for failure?” The screen behind him displayed the song title, the two words landing with the force of a physical blow. *Yesterday. The Beatles.* Liam stared at the screen, a cold wave of dread washing over him. It was a song he had known his entire life. It was beautiful. It was perfect. And it was an impossible trap. He couldn’t tear it down. He couldn’t build it up. It was a poisoned chalice, handed to him by the one judge who seemed to understand him best, a challenge designed to see if he was truly a force of nature, or just a man who had finally run out of miracles.The two words hung in the air of the studio, impossibly heavy, impossibly simple. *Yesterday*. The Beatles. It was not a song; it was a cornerstone of Western culture, a piece of music so deeply embedded in the collective consciousness that it felt less like a composition and more like a naturally occurring element, like water or air. The audience, sensing the monumental nature of the challenge, erupted in a cacophony of cheers and gasps. On stage, Liam felt the blood drain from his face. Marcus hadn't thrown him a lifeline. He had handed him an anchor and told him to fly. The other contestants looked at him with a mixture of pity and awe, as if he had just been nominated for a suicide mission. Even Chloe’s supportive smile couldn't hide the fear in her eyes. It was a perfect song, and his entire brand was built on fixing imperfections. He was a house renovator who had just been handed the Mona Lisa and told to ‘make it his own’.

For the next three days, Liam was a ghost haunting the 22nd floor. The song became his tormentor, a gentle melody that held the menace of a loaded gun. He sat with his guitar, the familiar chords feeling alien under his fingers. He played the simple, descending progression, a masterpiece of elegant sorrow, and it mocked him. There was nothing to add, nothing to take away. He tried to sing it, but his voice felt like a clumsy forgery. He was Paul McCartney’s karaoke singer. The lyrics, so clear and direct, offered no secret doors, no hidden meanings to exploit. It was a story of a love suddenly and inexplicably gone, a lament for a time when life was easy. What truth could he possibly bring to it that wasn’t already there? The song didn’t need him. He was a parasite on a perfect host.

His frustration curdled into a quiet, simmering panic. He saw Rex in the hallways, looking infuriatingly relaxed. Rex was working on his Queen song, a flamboyant explosion of theatricality that was perfectly suited to his style. He’d whistle the intricate melody as he passed Liam in the hall, a casual, cutting display of his own comfort zone. “Struggling to improve on perfection, Harrison?” Rex asked one afternoon, his tone laced with faux sympathy as he saw the dark circles under Liam’s eyes. “That’s the thing about a masterpiece. It doesn’t need your help. Sometimes you just have to admit you’re out of your league.” Every word was a perfect little dart, aimed at the heart of Liam’s insecurity. He was right. Liam was out of his league, and the whole country was about to watch him drown.

He finally sought refuge in Eleanor’s studio. The soundproofed walls felt like a fortress against the mounting pressure. He didn’t even say hello, just walked in, sat on the stool, and played the song, his performance stiff and lifeless. He finished and looked at her, his face a mask of desperation. “I can’t do it,” he said, his voice cracking. “There’s nothing here for me. It’s a perfect song. There are no flaws to find, no heart to uncover. It’s already there. Anything I do to it will just make it worse. It’s a trap.” Eleanor listened, her expression as still and unmoving as a granite statue. She let the silence hang for a long moment after he finished his defeated tirade, letting his words evaporate into the quiet of the room.

“You are a fool, Mr. Harrison,” she said at last, her voice devoid of any warmth. The bluntness of it startled him. “You come in here looking for a trick. A new arrangement. A clever hook. You are still thinking like a mechanic. Marcus did not give you a puzzle to solve. He gave you a mirror.” She stood up and walked towards him, her presence more imposing than ever. “Stop trying to change the song. The song is immutable. It is you who must change. You think the song is about a lost lover? Perhaps. But for you, what is your yesterday? What is the easy game that you can no longer play? What have you lost that you now need a place to hide away from?” She was so close he could see the fine lines around her sharp, intelligent eyes. “Do not perform this song. Do not interpret it. You must stand on that stage and let it pass through you. It is the purest test of the 'direct line' we once spoke of. If you have any art in you at all, you will not need to find the truth. The truth will find you.”

Her words struck him like a physical blow. He left the studio in a daze, her questions echoing in his head. *What is your yesterday?* He went back to his room, but instead of picking up the guitar, he just stood by the window, looking down at the endless, glittering expanse of Sydney. He thought of the person he was just a few weeks ago. The boy who felt trapped by the monotonous rhythm of the tides, by the steam wand hissing, by the sticky film of salt that coated everything. He had yearned for this new life, for the noise and the lights and the feeling of being someone, of being seen. He had it now. He was seen constantly. His every move was documented, his every emotion mined for a narrative. He was no longer a person; he was a concept, a brand, a story being told by other people. His love had been a simple, easy game. He had sung for the sheer joy of it, for the gulls, for the empty beach at dawn. Now, he sang for ratings, for judges, for a contract.

He had lost his anonymity. He had lost his simplicity. He had lost the freedom of being no one. And in that moment, staring out at the city that had become his beautiful cage, he was overwhelmed by a profound, aching nostalgia for the life he had so carelessly thrown away. *Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they’re here to stay. Oh, I believe in yesterday.* The lyrics were no longer about a girl. they were about him. The ‘she’ in *Why she had to go, I don’t know, she wouldn’t say* was his old self, a person who had vanished without warning, leaving this new, anxious, public version of Liam in his place. He suddenly, desperately, missed the boy who poured flat whites and had a useless degree under his bed. He had said something wrong. He had wished his simple life away, and now he was living with the consequences.

At the final rehearsal, Liam’s request was simple. “No band,” he told the musical director. “Just a single cello. And I’ll play acoustic.” Gaz’s voice crackled from the control booth, dripping with incredulity. “Are you kidding me? A cello? It’s Saturday night television, Harrison, not a recital at the bloody conservatorium. The song is already a downer. You’re going to put the whole country to sleep.” Liam didn’t argue. He just looked at the musical director, Dave, who had seen his performance the week before. Dave looked back at him, then up at the control booth. “Let’s just try it, Gaz,” he said, a note of quiet authority in his voice. Gaz grumbled, but acquiesced.

Liam sat on the stool, his guitar on his lap. The cellist, a woman with kind, weary eyes, gave him a small, encouraging nod. He closed his eyes, not picturing a sunset this time, but the faded posters on the wall of the Mooloolaba café. He pictured the glint of the sun on the Coral Sea, the sour smell of the rag he used to wipe the counter. He took a breath and began to play, his fingers tracing the familiar chords with a newfound reverence. The cello entered, its voice a deep, mournful sigh that wrapped around the melody of the guitar. And then he sang. He sang without affectation, without any vocal tricks. He simply told the story. His story. His voice was quiet, intimate, laced with a profound and genuine sadness. It wasn’t a performance of melancholy; it was the real thing. He was the man who had woken up to find his world irrevocably changed, who longed for the simple life he had not appreciated until it was gone forever. When he sang the final line, *Oh, I believe in yesterday,* his voice was barely a whisper, a fragile confession breathed into the vast, silent studio. When he finished, no one moved. The cellist had tears silently tracking down her face. In the control booth, Gaz was just staring, his hand hovering over the talk-back button, for once with nothing to say. Liam opened his eyes, feeling hollowed out, empty. He had found the only way to sing the song. He had to bleed.The night of the live show felt different. The usual backstage franticness was there – the shouting, the hiss of hairspray, the frantic energy of a thousand moving parts – but Liam felt strangely insulated from it, cocooned in a bubble of quiet resignation. He wasn’t nervous, not in the heart-pounding, stomach-churning way he had been before. This was a different feeling, a deep, somber calm, the feeling a person has when they have already accepted the worst possible outcome. He sat on a flight case in a shadowed corner, his guitar resting across his lap, his fingers idly tracing the frets without making a sound. He wasn't preparing to compete; he was preparing for a confession.

Chloe was a picture of poised professionalism, her nerves from the early weeks baked away by experience and newfound confidence. Her Patsy Cline song was a perfect vessel for her clear, emotive voice, and she delivered it with a simple, heartbreaking honesty that earned her a warm, sustained ovation. She had found her place, a comfortable and authentic niche that the audience adored. As she came off stage, flushed with success, she gave Liam’s shoulder a supportive squeeze. “You’ve got this,” she whispered, though her eyes betrayed a hint of worry, as if she knew he was about to venture somewhere she couldn’t follow.

Then came Rex. The opening fanfare of Queen’s ‘Somebody to Love’ blared through the studio, and he exploded onto the stage in a blaze of theatrical glory. It was a masterclass in performance. He moved with a dancer’s precision, his voice soaring through the complex vocal arrangements, hitting the gospel-choir highs and the rock-and-roll lows with effortless power. He interacted with the backup singers, played to the cameras, and commanded the stage with the absolute authority of a born star. It was flawless, exhilarating, and utterly spectacular. He wasn't just singing a song; he was producing a miniature broadway show in three minutes. The performance ended with him on his knees in a single, dramatic spotlight, and the audience erupted in a frenzy. It was pure, unadulterated entertainment, and Rex had given them everything they could possibly want.

As the stage crew cleared Rex’s elaborate setup, a profound quiet began to settle over the studio. A single stool was placed in a tight pool of white light. From the shadows, the cellist emerged and took her seat, her instrument looking dark and ancient under the glare. Then Liam walked out. He didn’t look at the audience or the judges. He walked to the stool with a slow, deliberate pace, his worn jeans and simple t-shirt a stark contrast to Rex’s flamboyant costume. The audience was a confused murmur. Where was the band? The spectacle? This felt less like a primetime show and more like a poetry reading.

Liam sat down, adjusted the microphone, and took a breath. He looked at the cellist and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. She drew her bow across the strings, and a low, mournful note filled the cavernous room, a sound so full of sorrow it seemed to absorb all other noise. Liam began to play, the simple, familiar chords of ‘Yesterday’ emerging, unadorned and clean. Then he sang. His voice was a near-whisper, an intimate confidence shared with millions. He sang not to the back row, but to the microphone in front of him, as if sharing a secret he could no longer bear to keep. The studio, which had been a rock arena just minutes before, was transformed into a single, quiet room. The audience was so still they seemed to have stopped breathing. The cameras did something they rarely did: they stopped moving, holding tight on Liam’s face, catching the genuine pain in his eyes as he sang of a life he longed for but could never reclaim. The performance was an act of radical stillness, an island of quiet grief in an ocean of noise. When he breathed the final, whispered line, the silence that followed was absolute. It was not the stunned silence of surprise, but the heavy, reverent silence of a sacred space, a silence so profound it felt louder than any applause.

For a long, uncomfortable moment, no one moved. Then, from high up in the darkness, a single person began to clap, a slow, solitary sound. Another joined in, then another. The applause grew not in a rush, but as a slow, swelling tide of deep, heartfelt respect. It never reached the frenzied roar Rex had received; it was something else, something deeper and more personal, the sound of thousands of people acknowledging a shared, private sorrow. Liam finally looked up, his eyes glassy, appearing dazed and hollowed out by his own performance.

The host, visibly moved, cleared his throat several times before he could speak. He turned to the judges, who all looked as if they had been holding their breath. “Marcus,” the host said, his voice hushed. “I… I don’t know what to say.” Marcus leaned forward, his face a grim, thoughtful mask. He looked from Liam to Rex, who stood on the side of the stage, his perfect smile now looking like a painted-on facade. “Tonight we saw two masters at work,” Marcus began, his voice a low, resonant rumble that seemed to quiet the very air. “Rex, what you did was a spectacle. It was a perfect piece of musical theatre, a display of breathtaking skill and showmanship. You gave a command performance. A ten out of ten.” Rex nodded, accepting the praise, but his eyes were fixed on Marcus, waiting for the inevitable ‘but’.

“And then,” Marcus continued, turning his full attention to Liam, “you came out. Rex’s performance was a coronation. Liam, you invited us to a funeral. His was about the power and the glory of the human voice. Yours was about the fragility and the solitude of the human soul. One was a shout to the heavens, the other was a whisper into the void. I don’t know how the public will vote,” he said, looking directly at Liam with an expression of profound, almost paternal respect. “But what you just did wasn’t about a competition. That was a work of art. And it was, in its own quiet way, one of the bravest things I have ever seen on this stage.”

The rest of the judges’ comments were a blur of hushed, emotional praise. Liam felt disconnected from it all, as if he were watching a replay of someone else’s life. He walked off stage feeling not triumphant, but utterly drained, as if he had donated a pint of blood—or a piece of his soul—and was lightheaded from the loss. Backstage, the atmosphere around him was different again. The respect had deepened into something akin to awe. People kept their distance, speaking in hushed tones as he passed, as if he were a grieving relative or a holy man deep in meditation.

He found Rex by the exit, away from the prying eyes and cameras. The spectacular performer was leaning against a wall, his leather jacket looking like a suit of armour that had failed to protect him. His face, for the first time, was stripped of all artifice. There was no smirk, no condescension. There was only the cold, hard look of a master craftsman who had just watched a shaman conjure real magic. “That was a dirty trick, Harrison,” Rex said, his voice flat and devoid of its usual silky texture. Liam said nothing. “I put on a perfect show,” Rex continued, more to himself than to Liam. “I did everything right. The vocals, the staging, the energy. That’s what this is supposed to be about.” He finally looked at Liam, a bitter, bewildered understanding dawning in his eyes. “You didn’t even try to compete, did you? You just bled all over the stage and made them watch. How is anyone supposed to compete with that?” Without waiting for an answer, he pushed himself off the wall and walked out into the night, leaving Liam alone with the chilling realisation that he had finally found a weapon more powerful than talent, more effective than spectacle: his own, genuine, marketable pain.The results show was an exercise in slow-motion cruelty. The finalists were arranged on stage under the hot, unforgiving lights, their smiles tight and fragile. Liam stood in a daze, the ghost of his performance still clinging to him like a shroud. The host, with his practiced air of solemnity, began the weekly ritual of salvation and damnation. Liam’s name was the first one called. The announcement was met with a deep, respectful roar from the audience, but he felt nothing—no relief, no joy. He simply stepped forward as instructed, a puppet whose strings were being pulled by a force he no longer understood. Chloe’s name was called soon after, her genuine, beaming smile a bright spot in the suffocating tension.

The line thinned. The host milked the drama, his pauses stretching into agonizing chasms of silence. Finally, only two contestants remained under the spotlights: a young, effervescent pop singer named Lily, whose talent was dwarfed by her infectious personality, and Rex Vance. A collective gasp went through the studio. Rex, the consummate professional, the pre-ordained star, was in the bottom two. The camera zoomed in on his face, but the mask was back in place. His expression was one of cool, almost bored, indifference. It was a masterful performance of its own, but Liam, watching from the safety of the saved, could see the frantic pulse beating in his throat. This was not part of the narrative. This was a catastrophic systems failure.

“Rex, Lily, you will now sing for survival,” the host intoned gravely. Lily went first, her voice trembling as she sang a saccharine ballad, her performance more about tearful pleading than vocal skill. Then it was Rex’s turn. He walked to the center of the stage, not with his usual swagger, but with a quiet, measured tread. He’d chosen a simple, heartbreaking ballad, a song of loss and regret. He sat on a stool, just as Liam had, with a single acoustic guitar. It was a shockingly transparent move, a desperate, calculated attempt to replicate Liam’s formula. He began to sing, his voice, as always, technically flawless. The notes were perfect, the pitch unwavering. He even tried to inject a slight tremor, a manufactured vulnerability into the performance. But it was like watching a master painter try to forge a child’s drawing. All the lines were correct, but the innocent, un-self-conscious heart was missing. He was acting sad. Liam had simply been sad. The difference was immense, and the audience could feel it.

The final decision fell to the judges. They saved Rex, citing his superior technical ability, but the reprieve was delivered like a sentence. “You are one of the most gifted vocalists we have ever had in this competition, Rex,” Marcus said, his voice cold and clinical. “But you are singing from your head, not from your gut. You just tried to sell us an emotion you clearly don’t feel. You are lucky that your technique is so good it can withstand the weight of that much insincerity. But luck runs out. Consider this a final warning.” The humiliation was absolute. Rex nodded, his face a granite mask, and walked back to the line, a man saved from drowning only to be told he had forgotten how to breathe.

Liam felt a wave of nausea. There was no victory in this, no satisfaction in seeing his rival humbled. He had just witnessed the machine at work. It had identified a successful formula—raw, public vulnerability—and it was now pressuring its other assets to replicate it. He saw his own future in Rex’s hollow performance: a future of being forced to re-enact his own pain, to turn his genuine emotion into a tired gimmick until it, too, felt as insincere as Rex’s tremor. The applause and cheering felt obscene, the sound of a crowd baying for blood disguised as art.

The moment they were off-air, Brenda May swept into the green room, her face aglow with a predator’s satisfaction. She ignored the tearful, eliminated Lily, her focus entirely on her remaining assets. “Spectacular television, everyone,” she announced, her voice ringing with triumph. She zeroed in on Liam, her eyes gleaming. “Liam, you have redefined this competition. The network is ecstatic. The numbers are astronomical. We’ve discovered the audience isn’t just looking for a singer; they’re starving for a soul.” Her words, which should have been a compliment, felt like a diagnosis. She clapped her hands together, a general leading her troops. “So we are going to give them what they want. This week’s theme is ‘Unplugged: Songs from the Heartbreak Hotel’. I want raw. I want real. I want tears. In the dailies, on the stage, I want you to dig deep and give us the pain that makes the music beautiful. Don’t hold anything back.” She was no longer asking him to tell the truth. She was demanding he bleed on a schedule.

He escaped to his room, the walls feeling closer than ever. The sprawling city view that had once seemed so terrifying and beautiful now just looked like a million windows full of people he was expected to perform his sadness for. He felt a profound sense of isolation, a loneliness that was deeper and more absolute than anything he had ever felt pouring coffee in Mooloolaba. He had thought that was a cage, but this, this was a perfectly designed panopticon where his own heart was the prisoner. He collapsed onto the bed, the exhaustion not physical, but existential. He had won. He was the star of the show. And he had never felt more like a loser. He wanted to call his mum, to hear her simple, uncomplicated pride, but the words caught in his throat. How could he explain that his victory was his greatest defeat? How could he tell her that the whole country was in love with how broken he was?

The silence was broken by a soft, hesitant knock on his door. He ignored it, hoping they would go away. The knock came again, more insistent this time. Cursing under his breath, he dragged himself to the door and pulled it open, ready to snarl at whichever PA had been sent to drag him to another pointless debrief. But it wasn’t a PA. It was Rex. He was out of his stage clothes, dressed in a simple black t-shirt and jeans. The carefully constructed hair was slightly messy, the mask of cool indifference was gone, replaced by a weary, hollowed-out expression Liam had never seen before. He looked smaller somehow, stripped of his usual aura of arrogant confidence. He wasn't holding a bottle of water or a witty, backhanded compliment. He just stood there, his hands shoved in his pockets, looking not at Liam, but at a spot on the carpet somewhere between them.

“They saved me,” Rex said, his voice flat, stripped of its usual melodic cadence. “Because I’m a better machine. My technical specs are superior.” He finally lifted his eyes, and they were filled with a bleak, burnt-out honesty. “You know what the worst part is? Up there, in that sing-off… for a second, I almost had it. I was thinking about my grandmother—the real story, not the one for the cameras. About how she used to sing to me when I was a kid. And for just a second, I felt it. A real feeling.” He shook his head, a bitter, self-mocking smile touching his lips. “And then my brain kicked in. My training. It started analyzing the feeling, trying to replicate it, trying to figure out the right way to modulate my voice to ‘perform’ it correctly. And just like that… it was gone. I was just a guy doing a sad-voice impression.” He looked at Liam, his gaze direct and stripped of all rivalry. “You don't have that filter, do you? It just… comes out.” He wasn’t asking a question. It was a statement of fact, a diagnosis from one patient to another. “I came here to ask you how you do it,” Rex said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “But I think I just figured it out.” He paused, a strange, grim understanding passing between the two of them, the star performer and the shaman. “You don’t. It does it to you.”The confession hung in the space between them, stark and unadorned. Rex’s words, stripped of their usual performative gloss, were more resonant than any power ballad. He had named the beast that Liam had felt chewing on his own soul. *It does it to you.* In that moment, the rivalry that had defined their existence in this high-rise prison evaporated, replaced by a grim and unsettling fraternity. Liam had no advice to offer, no words of comfort. He could only stand in the doorway, a mirror image of the man before him—one polished to a high sheen, the other weathered and raw, but both of them cracked. He gave a slow, almost imperceptible nod, an acknowledgment that carried the weight of everything they couldn't say. Rex held his gaze for a second longer, a flicker of something that might have been gratitude in his burnt-out eyes, then turned and walked down the silent, empty hallway, his shoulders slumped in a way that no camera would ever be permitted to capture.

The week that followed was a slow descent into a new kind of hell. Brenda’s ‘Heartbreak Hotel’ theme was a directive for emotional self-flagellation, and the entire production leaned into it with a ghoulish enthusiasm. The B-roll camera crews were no longer looking for ‘wondrous arrival’ shots; they were hunting for tears. They filmed the contestants talking about their first heartbreaks, their biggest regrets, their deepest fears. It was group therapy repurposed as reality television, with ratings as the intended outcome. Chloe, ever the professional, gave them a sweet, sad story about her childhood dog, a performance of gentle melancholy that was perfectly on-brand. Rex was a blank wall; he gave them nothing, answering their probing questions with curt, media-trained non-answers, his face a mask of polite boredom. He had withdrawn his soul from the marketplace.

Liam, however, simply shut down. The guitar, which had been his sanctuary and his weapon, now felt like an instrument of torture. He left it in its case, leaning against the wall like a coffin. He couldn’t sing. When he tried, the direct line from his heart to his voice felt severed, replaced by a tangled switchboard of self-awareness and expectation. He was being asked to feel on command, and the demand itself had cauterized the source. His room, with its spectacular, mocking view, became his cell. He’d sit for hours, staring at the cityscape, feeling nothing but a vast, grey numbness. The voice that could ‘heal the sick and raise the dead’ was silent, its owner in a self-imposed coma. The production team grew frantic. The golden goose was refusing to lay its golden, tear-stained eggs.

Gaz cornered him in the hallway on the way to a vocal session he was planning to skip. The director’s usual breezy jargon was gone, replaced by a raw, undisguised panic. “What is wrong with you, Harrison?” he hissed, his face uncomfortably close. “You’ve got the whole country in the palm of your hand and you’re going mute on me. This is ‘Heartbreak’ week! This is your Super Bowl! We’ve given you the perfect song, the ultimate showcase for your little broken-bird routine. You need to give us something!” Liam just stared at him, his expression blank. The lack of reaction seemed to infuriate Gaz more than any argument would have. “Don’t you get it? They love you because you hurt. So get in there and hurt for them!” The order was so grotesque, so nakedly vampiric, that it finally broke through Liam’s apathy. He didn’t say a word. He just turned around and walked back to his room, locking the door behind him.

The song they had chosen for him was a masterstroke of psychological cruelty. A PA had slid the envelope under his door two days earlier, and he had left it lying on the floor, unopened. He finally picked it up now, tearing it open with a sense of grim finality. Inside was a single sheet of paper. The song was ‘Hurt’. They hadn’t even specified an artist, as if the raw sentiment of the title was all that mattered. The Nine Inch Nails original was a howl of nihilistic self-loathing; the Johnny Cash cover was a deathbed confession, a man taking stock of a life of pain and regret. Both were masterpieces of despair. It was Brenda holding up a mirror and commanding him to bleed. The choice was so on-the-nose, so cynically perfect, that a dry, humorless laugh escaped his lips. It was the first sound he had made all day.

His refusal to perform at the band rehearsal caused a full-blown crisis. He walked into the studio, saw the setup, the expectant faces of the musicians, and just shook his head. “I can’t,” he said, his voice a hoarse whisper, and walked out, leaving a stunned silence in his wake. Hours later, Brenda May herself appeared at his door. The knock was sharp, imperious. He didn’t open it. “Liam,” her voice came through the wood, smooth and cold as steel. “You are under contract. You will perform the song we have assigned you on Saturday night. If you continue this behavior, you will be in breach, and I assure you, the consequences will be far more painful than singing a sad song on television. Do not test me.” The threat hung in the air, an iron fist in a velvet glove. He was trapped. There was no escape.

Later that evening, there was another knock. Softer this time. He expected Chloe, with her worried eyes and a cup of tea. He opened the door a crack. It was Rex. He was holding a bottle of expensive-looking whiskey and two of the hotel’s heavy glass tumblers. He didn’t ask for permission, just pushed the door open and walked in, his presence filling the sterile room with a weary, cynical energy. He placed the glasses on the small table by the window and poured two generous measures, the amber liquid catching the light of the city. He pushed one glass towards Liam and took the other for himself. “The vultures are circling, Harrison,” he said, his voice low. “I saw Gaz’s face. He looks like his prize racehorse has decided to take up knitting.” He took a sip of the whiskey, his eyes scanning Liam’s drawn, pale face. “You’ve got the yips. The golden faucet of pain has run dry, right when they need it most.”

Liam sank into the chair opposite him, the glass heavy in his hand. “I can’t do it,” he confessed, the words tasting like failure. “I try to sing, and there’s nothing there. It’s just… gone. It’s like they’ve scared it away.” Rex nodded slowly, swirling the whiskey in his glass. “Of course it’s gone. You can’t force a feeling. The harder you try to grab it, the faster it disappears. That’s amateur stuff.” He leaned forward, his expression serious, the teacher addressing the student. “You’re trying to live in it again. You’re trying to feel the salt on your tongue, right? You’re trying to actually be that sad kid in the café. That’s your mistake. You can’t go back there. Not really. And you’ll drive yourself insane trying.” He took another drink, his eyes fixed on Liam. “You need to stop being an artist and start being a cinematographer. Your job isn’t to feel the emotion anymore. Your job is to remember it. You need to detach. Objectify it. Treat your past like a film you’re directing.”

He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “When you get on that stage, don’t try to feel sad. That’s for the audience. You need to be cold. Clinical. Remember the details. The exact shade of the spilled milk on the counter. The sound of a specific gull. The precise look on your mum’s face when she’s tired. You catalogue those details, you project them out of your head with your voice, and you let the audience put the emotion together for themselves. You give them the ingredients of sadness, and they will bake the cake. You just have to be the guy reading the recipe. It feels like a lie, but it’s not. It’s just professional.” He sat back, letting the advice settle, a piece of dark, brilliant, and utterly necessary wisdom. It was a trade-off: a way to survive the machine, but the price was the last shred of his untainted connection to his own art. Liam looked from the whiskey in his glass to the guitar sitting silent in the corner. He had a choice. He could break, or he could learn how to fake his own truth. He picked up the glass and drained it in one, burning swallow.The whiskey burned a trail of cold fire down his throat, a stark, physical sensation that momentarily silenced the noise in his head. In the hazy morning light, the glass sat on the nightstand, a monument to his surrender. He didn't feel better. He didn't feel healed. He felt cold, clear, and hollow, like a house whose tenants had packed up and left in the middle of the night. Rex’s words from the night before were not a comfort; they were a blueprint, a schematic for survival that required the dismantling of his own spirit. He had a choice: be a casualty or be a collaborator in his own commodification. He picked up his phone, not to call his mother, but to send a single, curt text to the production coordinator: ‘Book me the main rehearsal studio. One hour. I’m ready.’

He walked into the studio like a different person. The anxious, uncertain energy that had clung to him like the coastal humidity was gone, replaced by a still, quiet focus that was far more unnerving. He bypassed a relieved-looking Gaz, ignored the flurry of questions from PAs, and went directly to the musical director. “Just a cello, like we tried,” he said, his voice flat and even. “And I need a different microphone. A condenser. I want it to pick up everything. Every breath. Every scrape of my finger on the string.” Dave, the MD, looked at him with renewed interest, recognizing the language of a professional, not a terrified amateur. Liam turned to the cellist, the same woman from before. “Follow my breath,” he instructed, his tone polite but devoid of warmth. “When I pull back, you swell. You are the emotion. I’m just the narrator.” The woman nodded, her expression shifting from sympathetic to intrigued. He was no longer a boy she needed to comfort; he was a conductor giving a precise directive.

He sat on the stool and began to play, not for Gaz or the band, but for the sound engineer behind the glass, treating the rehearsal like a technical run-through. He sang the first verse of ‘Hurt’, his eyes open and fixed on a spot on the far wall. His voice was clean, controlled, every note perfectly placed. He wasn’t feeling. He was projecting. He summoned the images Rex had spoken of, treating them like slides in a carousel. *Image: the precise way the rust had eaten into the metal legs of the café tables. Image: the fraying cuff of his favourite old jumper. Image: the network of tiny lines around his mother’s eyes when she laughed.* He was a documentarian of his own past, his voice the instrument of transmission. On the line, “The needle tears a hole,” he didn’t sing with anguish; he sang with a chilling, detached precision, as if describing a medical procedure. The cello behind him wept and swelled, filling the emotional space he had deliberately vacated. When he finished, the studio was deathly quiet. Gaz’s voice crackled over the intercom, shaky and confused. “Okay… yeah. That’ll work. Jesus.” Liam didn’t acknowledge him. He simply nodded to the cellist and the engineer, stood up, and walked out of the room, his part of the transaction complete.

On the night of the live show, a strange calm had settled over him. He watched the other contestants from the wings, his mind a quiet, orderly place. He felt like an observer, a visitor from another world. Rex delivered a blistering, high-energy rock number, a tactical retreat to his core strength of pure, polished showmanship. He was brilliant, professional, and safe, a performance designed to remind the judges of his commercial viability. After his performance, as he passed Liam in the darkened corridor backstage, he didn’t offer a witty remark. He simply gave a single, sharp nod, the silent acknowledgment of a fellow tradesman. The student was about to present his thesis.

Walking to the stage felt like stepping into a laboratory. The lights, the audience, the judges—they were all variables in an experiment he was about to conduct. He sat on the stool, the warmth of the lights a distant sensation. He registered the silence, the expectation, the thousands of pairs of eyes, but he felt none of it. He was hermetically sealed inside his new method. The cellist began, her mournful notes laying a bed of sorrow for him to lie upon. He closed his eyes, not to feel, but to better see the images stored in his mind’s archive. *I hurt myself today, to see if I still feel.* The line came out not as a cry, but as a statement of fact, the opening of a lab report. His voice was a scalpel, dissecting his own history with surgical precision. *I focus on the pain, the only thing that’s real.* He sang the line while picturing the chipped rim of a coffee cup, the detail so vivid and specific that it became, in that moment, the only real thing in the universe.

He didn't build to a crescendo of pain. He built a museum of it, each line a different exhibit, each note a plaque describing the artifact. He was a tour guide walking the audience through the ruins of his own 'yesterday'. For the final verse, Johnny Cash’s verse, he let a new set of images in. The sterile hotel room. The flashing ‘On Air’ sign. Brenda May’s predatory smile. Rex’s hollowed-out eyes. *If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself. I would find a way.* The confession was real, but the pain was second-hand, a memory of a feeling, not the feeling itself. He sang the final line and let the sound fade into nothing, his face a perfect mask of serene, dignified sorrow. The performance was a lie. And it was the most truthful thing he had ever sung on that stage.

The reaction was immediate and terrifying. The silence was deeper, more profound than the week before. And then came the sound. It wasn't applause. It was the sound of weeping. A soft, collective, heartbroken sob that rippled through the entire auditorium. The cameras panned across the audience, capturing faces streaked with tears, people holding each other, utterly devastated. Liam had given them the ingredients, and they had baked a thousand different cakes of their own private grief. He had become a vessel for their pain, a blank screen onto which they projected their own heartbreaks. He had never been more powerful, or more alone.

When the host finally spoke, his voice was thick with emotion. The judges looked shattered. Marcus stared at Liam, his face not grim or severe, but deeply, profoundly sad. He didn't speak for a long time, just held Liam’s gaze. “In my life,” Marcus said finally, his voice raspy, “I have seen artists give a piece of themselves to an audience. I have never before seen a man perform his own vivisection on live television and leave his soul on the stage for everyone to see.” He shook his head, a look of deep conflict in his eyes. “It was a masterpiece of emotional devastation. It was perfect. And I hated every single second of it.” He looked away from Liam, towards the camera. “Because I fear we have just witnessed the birth of a great artist, and the death of a happy man. And I’m not sure we, or he, should be celebrating that.” The words were a benediction and an indictment, a crown of thorns placed gently on Liam’s head. He had won. The cost was simply everything.The silence that followed Marcus’s verdict was more damning than any booing could ever have been. It was the silence of a truth so stark and uncomfortable that no one knew how to react. The applause had been for the art; the silence was for the man. As Liam walked off stage, the crew members and fellow contestants parted for him as if he were a leper, their faces a mixture of awe, pity, and fear. The usual post-performance back-slaps and “great job, mate” were conspicuously absent. He was surrounded by a quarantine of respect. Chloe reached him first, her own triumph forgotten. She didn’t congratulate him. She grabbed his arm, her hand trembling, and looked into his blank, distant eyes. “Liam, are you okay?” she asked, her voice a small, worried whisper. The simple, human question was so out of place in the artificial ecosystem of the show that he had no idea how to answer it.

Before he could even try, Brenda May descended upon them, her face alight with a terrifying, ecstatic energy. She moved with the triumphant swagger of a general whose risky strategy had just won the war. “A masterpiece of emotional devastation,” she quoted Marcus, her voice dripping with glee, not concern. She beamed at Liam, her eyes shining with the thrill of a ratings victory. “The network is in raptures. The phone lines exploded. You’re not just a contestant anymore, Liam. You’re a cultural event.” She patted his arm, a gesture that felt more like she was assessing the quality of a prize-winning animal than offering comfort. “The ‘Broken Artist’ narrative arc is the most compelling story we’ve had in years. This is television gold. Pure gold.” She didn’t see a man; she saw a demographic, a trend, a product whose key selling point was its own destruction. The celebration felt like a wake.

Sleep was no longer a possibility. His hotel room was a silent tomb, the sprawling city lights outside the window providing no comfort, only a cold, indifferent illumination. He sat on the edge of the bed for hours, the television a blank screen, his phone lying face down. He was afraid to turn either of them on, afraid to see the face that was supposedly his, praised for its exquisite suffering. The numbness of the past few days had receded, replaced by a vast, echoing emptiness. He had poured everything out on that stage, every memory, every detail, and now there was nothing left inside. He was a vessel that had been emptied for public consumption. He had won the game, but in doing so, had proven Rex’s bleakest prophecies correct. He had strip-mined his own soul for their entertainment, and now the landscape was barren.

Finally, at three in the morning, his resolve crumbled. He needed to hear a voice that wasn’t analyzing him, praising him, or trying to sell him something. He needed an anchor. He called his mum. She answered instantly, her voice thick and alert, as if she had been sitting by the phone, waiting. “Liam?” He tried to speak, but only a choked, broken sound came out. “Oh, lovey,” she said, and the simple, unconditional love in those two words broke him. A single, hot tear traced a path down his cheek, the first thing he had genuinely felt all night. “I saw it,” she said, her voice quiet and strained. “Mel had it on the big screen at the club. The whole place was watching.” There was a pause, and he could hear her take a shaky breath. “About halfway through, I asked Jake to drive me home. I couldn’t watch anymore.” This wasn’t the proud, ecstatic call from weeks ago. This was the voice of a mother who had just watched her son walk into a fire. “That man on the television, the judge, he said you were a great artist but not a happy man. And he was right, wasn’t he? That face on the screen… that wasn’t my boy. That was a ghost. What are they doing to you in that place, Liam?”

Her question was a key turning a lock deep inside him. It wasn’t a cage anymore. It was a factory, and he was both the raw material and the product, being systematically disassembled and re-packaged for sale. The ambition that had propelled him here, the desperate need to escape the familiar rhythm of his life, now seemed like a foolish, childish dream. He had traded a beautiful cage for an abattoir. “I want to come home,” he whispered into the phone, the words feeling like the first truly authentic thing he had said all week. There was no hesitation on her end, only a wave of pure, unadulterated relief. “Your room’s waiting for you, lovey,” she said, her voice breaking. “It’s always waiting.”

After the call, clarity descended. It wasn’t a difficult decision. It was the only decision. It was an act of self-preservation. He moved with a quiet, methodical purpose he hadn't felt in weeks. He opened his cheap duffel bag and began to pack. He left the neatly folded piles of X-Factor branded tracksuits and t-shirts on the bed, a uniform for a soldier deserting his post. He packed his own worn jeans, his faded surf-shop hoodies, the clothes that held the faint, lingering scent of salt and home. He slid the cardboard tube containing his Bachelor of Marketing degree out from under the bed—the bitter joke that now felt like a relic from another, simpler lifetime—and placed it carefully in the bag. It was a part of his story they had never been interested in, and for that, he was suddenly grateful. He picked up his guitar, its familiar weight a comfort, a friend who had been forced to bear witness to his ordeal.

He stood in the middle of the room and looked around one last time at the sterile luxury, the panoramic view of a world he had briefly conquered and now utterly rejected. He felt no regret, only a profound and urgent need to leave. He pulled out a sheet of the hotel’s heavy stationery and a pen. He thought of writing a long letter to Brenda, a scathing indictment of the machine. He thought of writing to Marcus, to thank him for seeing the truth. But words felt useless, part of the game he was now refusing to play. Instead, he wrote just three. *I quit. Liam.* He left the note on the pillow where the branded clothes lay. It was a simple, stark resignation. On his way out, he stopped in front of Rex’s door. He took another piece of paper and wrote two words this time. *You were right.* He slid it under the door, a final message to his strange, cynical saviour. He didn’t take the express lift in the lobby. He found a service elevator at the end of the hall, the kind used by housekeeping and room service. As the brushed steel doors slid closed, he caught his reflection. The face staring back was tired, gaunt, and etched with a profound weariness, but for the first time in a very long time, it was his own. He wasn't the Surfer-Boy-Saviour, or the Broken Artist. He was just Liam Harrison. And he was going home.The service elevator whirred and clunked its way down, a utilitarian metal box smelling faintly of bleach and stale cigarette smoke. It was a jarring contrast to the silent, carpeted opulence of the guest lifts, which ascended with the smooth, soundless grace of a prayer. Liam felt the difference in his bones. This was a descent back to reality, a journey into the engine room of the magnificent ship he was abandoning. He emerged not into a lobby of marble and meaningless art, but into a concrete basement labyrinth of humming ice machines, bundled linens, and the greasy, comforting smell of the staff canteen’s breakfast shift. He was invisible here. A ghost in a grey hoodie, his guitar case a cumbersome, unfamiliar appendage. No one gave him a second glance. He was just another part of the machinery, heading for the exit. He pushed through a heavy fire door and found himself in a narrow, shadowed laneway, the pre-dawn air cool and tasting of diesel fumes and damp pavement. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever tasted.

He walked for several blocks before hailing a taxi, the act itself a small miracle of regained autonomy. The driver, a weary-looking man with a podcast about ancient history murmuring from the speakers, glanced at him in the rear-view mirror. "To the airport, mate?" he asked, and that was it. There was no flicker of recognition, no hushed whisper of "Aren't you that guy from the telly?". He was just a fare, a man with a guitar case heading for the airport at an ungodly hour. The relief was so profound it was almost dizzying. As the cab pulled into the city’s traffic, his phone, which he had foolishly left on, began to buzz. A blocked number. It buzzed again, and again, a frantic, insistent vibration against his leg. It was the machine, waking up and realizing a cog was missing. It was the sound of panic, of schedules being destroyed, of a narrative going off-script. With a slow, deliberate movement, he reached into his pocket, held down the power button, and watched the screen go black. The ensuing silence felt absolute, a small, perfect victory.

The domestic terminal was a cathedral of quiet, early-morning transit. People slept in uncomfortable chairs, nursed takeaway coffees, and stared blankly at departure boards. They were all in-between, moving from one part of their real lives to another. Liam checked his duffel bag, bought a coffee that was scalding hot and reassuringly mediocre, and found a seat by a window overlooking the tarmac. He watched the ground crews moving in their fluorescent vests, the baggage carts balletically weaving across the wet asphalt. It was a world of tangible purpose, of things that needed to be loaded and planes that needed to fly. It was a world blessedly free of B-roll, media training, and the relentless demand for marketable pain. He was just a guy waiting for a flight, another anonymous face in the river of humanity, and the ordinariness of it was a balm to his scorched soul. He didn't think about what would happen when his absence was discovered. He didn't think about the contract or Brenda May’s rage. He thought only of the gentle curve of Mooloolaba Bay.

The flight was short, a little over an hour, but the transition was seismic. As the plane banked and began its descent, the sprawling, intricate geometry of Sydney gave way to the deep, unbroken blue of the Pacific. Then, land appeared. Not the grey-brown haze of a metropolis, but a vibrant, living coastline of impossible greens and golds. He saw the Glass House Mountains hazy in the distance, the winding thread of the Maroochy River, the white-flecked surf rolling onto endless stretches of sand. This was a landscape painted with a different palette, shaped by a different god. He felt his shoulders, which had been hunched in a permanent defensive crouch for weeks, begin to unclench. His lungs, accustomed to the refrigerated, recycled air of the hotel and the studio, felt tight, as if preparing for a different atmosphere.

The moment the plane doors opened, it hit him. Not just air, but a thick, warm, living entity. It was a wall of humidity, saturated with the smell of salt, damp earth, and blooming frangipani. It coated his tongue and worked its way into the seams of his clothes. He had forgotten its power, its sheer, physical presence. He walked down the metal steps onto the tarmac—there were no aerobridges at the small Sunshine Coast airport—and the sound was the next wave. Not the hum of traffic and distant sirens, but the shrill, familiar caw of gulls and the high-pitched thrum of cicadas, a sound so intrinsic to home he hadn’t even realized he’d missed it. He stopped at the bottom of the stairs, his duffel bag in one hand, his guitar in the other, and closed his eyes. He breathed it all in, a man dying of thirst taking his first drink of water.

The taxi home was a journey back through his own life. The driver, a young woman with zinc on her nose, recognized him instantly. “Hey, you’re Liam!” she said, her smile wide and uncomplicated. “We’ve all been watching you, mate. You’re a bloody legend! What are you doing back?” He just smiled, a tired, genuine smile. “Just came home for a bit,” he said, and she accepted it without question, launching into a story about how the whole pub she worked at went quiet every time he sang. It was different here. The fame wasn’t a commodity; it was a form of community pride, simple and direct. The car passed the surf club, the beachfront café where he used to work—it looked smaller, somehow—the familiar pandanus trees leaning in the wind. The glare off the Coral Sea was a physical force, but it no longer felt relentless. It felt like a welcome.

He asked the driver to drop him at the end of his street. He wanted to walk the last few yards himself. The house was a small, weatherboard cottage, its paint peeling slightly from the constant assault of the salt air. It looked beautiful. The front door opened before he was halfway up the garden path. His mum stood there, her face a roadmap of worry, love, and profound relief. She looked older than he remembered, or perhaps he was just seeing her more clearly now. She didn’t run to him, and he didn’t run to her. They met in the middle of the small, overgrown lawn. She wrapped her arms around him, her small frame surprisingly strong, and he buried his face in her shoulder, the familiar scent of her washing powder and her skin an anchor in the spinning world. He held on tight, his body shaking with the release of weeks of coiled tension. There were no words. None were needed.

Later, in the quiet of his old bedroom, the world felt small and manageable again. The room was exactly as he’d left it, a museum of his former life. Surf posters on the wall, a stack of dog-eared novels on the bedside table, the cardboard tube with his degree sticking out from under the bed. He opened the window, and the sound of the ocean, a distant, rhythmic shushing, filled the space. The salt was in the air, a fine, gritty mist. He picked up his phone, the sleek, black rectangle that had been his lifeline and his leash. He didn't smash it. He didn't throw it into the sea. He simply popped the back off, removed the SIM card—a tiny chip containing an entire world of pressure and expectation—and let it fall onto the dusty floor. He was offline. He was disconnected. He was free. He lay back on his narrow bed, the lumpy mattress a greater comfort than any king-sized pillow-topped monstrosity, and listened to the waves. The salt was the first thing. Always. But it was no longer the taste of a cage. It was the taste of home.The first morning back was a slow, gentle awakening, a stark contrast to the jolting, pre-dawn summons of the production schedule. He woke not to an alarm or a PA knocking on his door, but to a slash of bright, humid sunlight cutting through a gap in his old, faded curtains. The air was thick and still, stirred only by the lazy whir of the ceiling fan clicking softly with each rotation. He lay there for a long time, listening. He could hear the distant, rhythmic sigh of the surf, the chatter of rainbow lorikeets in the mango tree outside, the clatter of his mother making breakfast in the kitchen. These were the sounds of his life, a soundtrack he hadn't realized he’d been missing until it was returned to him. There was no schedule on a tablet, no camera crew waiting to film him look ‘natural’, no one demanding he feel anything at all. The day stretched before him, a vast, formless, beautiful expanse of nothing. It was the greatest luxury he had ever known.

In the kitchen, his mother moved with a quiet, practiced efficiency. She didn’t ask him about the show, about Sydney, about the haunted look in his eyes. She simply placed a plate of scrambled eggs and buttery toast in front of him, the way she had a thousand times before. The gesture was an act of profound, uncomplicated love, a reclamation. They ate in a comfortable silence, punctuated only by the scrape of cutlery on plates and the murmur of a local radio station. He watched her hands as she refilled his coffee cup, noting the network of fine lines and the faint, permanent stain of garden soil under her nails. These were real hands, hands that fixed things and grew things and held him when he was small. Everything in this room, from the chipped ceramic mugs to the faded tea towel hanging on the oven door, was imbued with a history that was messy, authentic, and his own. He felt the tight, frozen knot in his chest, a knot he hadn’t even been fully aware of, begin to slowly, painstakingly, dissolve.

The shrill ring of the landline, a sound he hadn’t heard in months, made him jump. His mother answered, her voice soft, then she passed the receiver to him with a small, knowing smile. It was Jake. The voice that came roaring down the line was a jolt of pure, uncut Mooloolaba energy. “You absolute lunatic! You did it! You actually just walked out! It’s all over the news, mate. They’re losing their minds! Are you okay? Did they have snipers on the roof?” The barrage of questions was so perfectly Jake that Liam let out a real, genuine laugh, a sound that felt rusty from disuse. “I’m okay, mate,” he said, leaning against the kitchen wall. “Just… done.” “Done? You were winning! You were the king!” Jake’s voice was a mixture of awe and utter bewilderment. “Yeah, well. The crown was too heavy,” Liam said, the words coming out simpler and truer than any lyric he’d sung on stage. There was a pause on the other end, and then Jake’s tone softened. “Fair enough. Well, the king is home. First beer is on me. Don’t be a stranger.” The call was a bridge back to a world where walking away from fame wasn’t a crisis or a breach of contract, but something your best mate would understand after a moment of stunned disbelief.

Later that morning, the four walls of his house, which had at first felt like a sanctuary, began to feel too small. He needed air, space, the horizon. He pulled on a pair of old boardshorts and a t-shirt, slid his feet into worn-out thongs, and stepped out into the blinding midday sun. The walk towards the beach was a gauntlet of familiar faces. A neighbour watering his lawn gave him a thumbs-up and a wide grin. A woman driving past in a minivan slowed down and yelled “Go, Liam!” out the window. It wasn't intrusive or demanding; it was warm, personal, but it was also a constant reminder that he was no longer just a local boy. He was a local hero, a public figure, a role he had just run a thousand kilometres to escape. He felt a phantom urge to look around for a camera crew, to arrange his face into a mask of humble gratitude. The training was sunk deep.

He found himself standing across the road from the beachfront café. It looked exactly the same, a little tired, a little shabby, the windows hazed with a fine layer of salt. Through the glass, he could see Mel, a thunderous scowl on her face as she berated a young kid fumbling with the coffee grinder. He almost kept walking, but some instinct told him he needed to close this circle. He crossed the road, the hot asphalt burning the soles of his feet, and pushed open the door. The jingle of the little bell above the door was a sound from another lifetime. Mel looked up, her scowl deepening as she saw him. “What in the bloody hell do you want?” she rasped, her voice pure gravel. “Come to quit again?” Liam felt a flush of shame. “No,” he said, his voice quiet. “I came to apologize. For how I left.” He stood there, waiting for the tirade. Instead, she just stared at him for a long moment, her shrewd eyes taking in his tired face, the anxious energy he was trying to hide. She grunted, a sound that was her equivalent of a sigh. She turned, pulled a cup, and slammed it under the espresso machine. “You looked like a damned ghost on the telly last week,” she said, not looking at him, her back turned as she frothed the milk with an aggressive hiss. “Thought you were gonna fall over. This one’s on the house,” she added, sliding a flat white across the counter towards him. “Don’t get used to it.” It was the closest he would ever get to an expression of concern from her, and it meant more than all the judges’ praise combined.

He took the coffee, the ceramic warm in his hands, and walked down the wooden stairs to the beach. He found a spot on the soft, white sand, far from the main throng of sunbathers and tourists, and sat down. He watched the impossibly blue water of the Coral Sea roll in, each wave collapsing on the shore in a hiss of white foam. The coffee was strong and slightly bitter, just as he remembered. He didn’t feel the need to sing. He didn’t feel the need to do anything. The constant, gnawing pressure to create, to feel, to perform, was gone. There was only the sun on his skin, the rhythmic crash of the waves, and the vast, empty canvas of the sky. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime, his mind was quiet. He just sat and watched the tide come in, a man learning how to simply exist again. He was not an artist. He was not a star. He was a body on a beach, and it was enough.

He returned home as the afternoon light began to soften, turning the sky a pale, dusty pink. The house was quiet. He found his mum in the living room, watching the television with the sound turned low. He was about to speak when he saw his own face flash onto the screen. It was an entertainment news program, the graphics loud and flashy. The chyron at the bottom of the screen screamed: “X-FACTOR IN CHAOS: STAR FINALIST LIAM HARRISON QUITS SHOW.” There was footage of him from the last performance, his face pale and strained. There was a tight-lipped “no comment” from a harried-looking Brenda May being ambushed in a parking garage. There were ‘industry experts’ speculating wildly about a nervous breakdown, a secret illness, a dramatic falling out with the judges. They were turning his escape into a new storyline, his private act of self-preservation into the season’s most dramatic plot twist. He watched, a cold knot forming in his stomach, as they defined him, packaged him, and sold his departure as just another piece of must-see TV. He had left the building, but he hadn't escaped the story. The machine didn’t need him present to keep grinding him up.His mother switched the television off with a sharp, angry flick of the remote, plunging the room into a sudden, blessed silence. The slick, sensationalist graphics and the smirking face of the entertainment reporter vanished, but their residue lingered in the air, a toxic, invisible film. Liam sat frozen on the couch, the cold knot in his stomach tightening into a solid fist of ice. They had taken his quiet, desperate act of self-preservation and twisted it into a spectacle, another cliffhanger in the weekly drama. The ‘Broken Artist’ hadn’t escaped; he’d just been given a new, more tragic, and far more profitable storyline. The machine hadn’t been broken by his departure; it had simply absorbed it, metabolizing his rebellion into more content. He had walked out of the prison, only to discover the walls were everywhere.

“Vultures,” his mother said, her voice a low, furious tremor. She stood by the blank television screen, her hands clenched at her sides. “They’re not happy just to put you through a meat grinder, they want to pick over the bones, too. To say those things… ‘a nervous breakdown’… like you’re some kind of performing monkey who finally snapped.” Her anger was a shield, a fierce, protective fire that was more comforting than any gentle words could have been. She saw him not as a story, not as a casualty, but as her son, and she was furious on his behalf. “They don’t get to do this, Liam. They don’t get to follow you home and write stories about you. This is your home. You’re safe here.” He wanted to believe her, but he could feel the long, cold shadow of the Sydney tower stretching all the way to this small, quiet living room. Safety felt like a memory from a world that no longer existed.

The next day, the illusion of peace was shattered. The easy anonymity he had felt for a fleeting twenty-four hours was gone, replaced by a constant, low-grade vigilance. When he walked outside, his eyes scanned the street not for familiar faces, but for unfamiliar cars parked at odd angles. He looked for the glint of sunlight on something that didn't belong. The town’s affection, which had felt so warm and simple the day before, now seemed tinged with the media’s narrative. The friendly waves from passing cars felt different, freighted with a new curiosity. He could see the questions in their eyes, the echo of the television reports. They weren’t just proud of the local boy who made good; they were worried about, and fascinated by, the fragile star who had supposedly cracked. He was no longer just Liam; he was a story they had all been told, and he could feel them trying to fit him into its frame.

He tried to find sanctuary on the beach, walking far down the coast towards a stretch of deserted sand where the tourists rarely ventured. He needed to feel the sun and the salt without the weight of being watched. Jake met him there, carrying a weathered Esky and two fishing rods. For an hour, it almost worked. They cast their lines into the surf, the conversation drifting easily between old school friends and the dismal prospects of the local footy team. It was a perfect facsimile of their old lives, a moment of cherished, profane normalcy. They were just two mates fishing. But then Liam saw it. A flicker of movement in the scrubby dunes behind them, a place where no one should be. A quick, sharp glint of light. A long lens. The paparazzi had found him. The machine had sent a scout. The cold dread that washed over him was a familiar, sickening tide.

Jake saw the change in his expression and followed his gaze. His easy-going smile vanished, replaced by a thunderous scowl. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” he snarled, dropping his rod in the sand. “I’ll go have a word with that creep.” He started towards the dunes, his posture radiating aggression, ready to defend his friend and his territory. But Liam grabbed his arm, his grip surprisingly strong. “No, Jake. Don’t.” Jake turned, bewildered. “What do you mean, don’t? He’s filming you! I’m gonna go break his bloody camera.” Liam shook his head, a grim, weary wisdom in his eyes that hadn’t been there a month ago. “And then what? The headline tomorrow will be ‘Troubled Star’s Violent Mate Attacks Photographer’. It’s what they want. They want a scene. They want a reaction. Anything but anger, mate. Anger is currency for them. Don’t give them anything.” The lesson, learned in a high-rise hotel room from a cynical rival, was now being put to use on a Mooloolaba beach. He had learned the rules of their game, and rule number one was that emotional honesty was ammunition they would use against you.

They packed up their gear in silence, the easy camaraderie of the morning gone, replaced by a tense, hunted feeling. The sacred space had been violated, the sanctuary breached. The walk back along the shoreline was not a peaceful stroll but a tactical retreat. Liam felt the unseen lens on his back with every step, a phantom touch that made his skin crawl. He kept his head down, his shoulders hunched, his face a neutral mask. He was performing again, performing ‘unbothered’, a role that was just as exhausting as performing ‘heartbroken’. The joy of being home was rapidly being replaced by the familiar claustrophobia of being a specimen under a microscope. He had run all this way only to find himself in a slightly larger, sunnier laboratory.

Back in the house, he pulled the blinds closed, shutting out the bright, beautiful day. His mother watched him, her face etched with a helpless anger. The house no longer felt like a fortress; it felt like a bunker. He knew this wasn't sustainable. He couldn't spend the rest of his life hiding in the dark, peeking through the curtains, waiting for the vultures to get bored and fly away. They wouldn’t. The story was too good. He had to do something, but he couldn’t fight them on their terms. Lashing out was a loss. Silence was a loss; it allowed them to write whatever story they wanted. He felt utterly checkmated, trapped between a narrative he didn't write and a silence that would be filled with lies. He slumped onto the couch, the weight of his impossible situation pressing down on him.

He sat there for a long time, the silence of the dim room punctuated by the ticking of a clock on the wall. He thought of Rex’s cynicism, of Eleanor’s wisdom, of his mother’s fierce, protective love. He had run from the noise, but the story had followed him. He couldn’t outrun it. He couldn’t fight it. What was left? He looked across the room and saw his guitar case leaning against the wall. It wasn't an instrument of torture anymore. It wasn't a prop. It was a tool. His tool. The only one he had left. They had taken his voice and used it to tell their story. The only way to win wasn't to stop singing. It was to sing a song they couldn't co-opt, a story they couldn't twist. His own. Not a cover, not an interpretation, but a song born here, in this room, out of this impossible situation. He wouldn't be their Broken Artist or their Troubled Star. He would be a songwriter. He stood up, crossed the room, and unclasped the latches on the case. The war wasn't over. It was just entering a new, quieter, and far more dangerous phase.
