The scent of old dust and ozone was a perfume Isla knew better than any Chanel. It clung to the back of her throat, a familiar ghost in the grand, decaying Edinburgh townhouse where she spent her Tuesday morning. From her perch atop a stepladder, the world was a canvas of peeling floral wallpaper and intricate, cobweb-laced cornicing. Below, Mrs Carmichael’s prize-winning collection of porcelain cats stared up with glassy, accusatory eyes. One wrong move, one misplaced boot on the dust sheet, and she’d be in a world of feline-themed trouble. Isla’s fingers, nimble and sure, worked within the brass guts of a vintage ceiling rose. Red to red, black to black, the earth a comforting green and yellow stripe. It was a language she understood. A logical, predictable world of currents and connections. A circuit was either complete or it was broken. It worked, or it didn’t. Simple.

Her phone vibrated in her pocket, a frantic buzz against her hip. She ignored it. Probably Kirsty with another meme about a squirrel that looked vaguely like Simon Cowell. The buzz came again, more insistent this time. With a sigh, she nipped the final wire into its housing, her movements economical. Only then did she fish the phone out, balancing precariously as she swiped to answer, tucking it between her ear and shoulder.

"Isla Sparkes Electrical, you spark 'em, I park 'em."

A pause on the other end, followed by a crisp, southern English accent that sounded like it had been ironed. "Isla? It's Julian from Syco."

Isla’s breath hitched. Syco. The name alone felt expensive. She nearly dropped a terminal screw. "Oh. Right. Hi." Her voice was a croak.

"Just a courtesy call, darling. We're all beyond thrilled. The numbers from the semi-final were astronomical. Absolutely bonkers." Julian’s enthusiasm was so polished it barely sounded human. "We just need to confirm your song choice for the final. The arrangement needs to be with the musical director by Friday at the latest. Have you decided?"

The final. The word still didn't feel real. It tasted strange in her mouth, like champagne you’d only ever seen in films. A week ago, she’d been Isla Sparkes, the singing sparky from Leith, a local curiosity who’d somehow warbled her way through the auditions. Now, after a semi-final performance that had apparently made one of the judges weep on live television, she was a finalist in Britain’s Got Talent. Her, with her calloused hands and a van that smelled permanently of bacon rolls and cable sheathing.

"Aye," she said, her own accent feeling suddenly as thick and unwieldy as porridge. "I have. I'm doing it."

"Doing... 'it'?" Julian prompted.

"The Skye Boat Song."

Another pause. Isla could picture him, sitting in a glass-walled office in London, frowning into a state-of-the-art headset. "The... folk song? A cappella again?"

"No," Isla said, twisting the cap back onto the ceiling rose with a satisfying click. "With my guitar. And a string quartet. My arrangement."

"Right," Julian said, the single word freighted with a universe of doubt. "Well, send it over. The car will be picking you up from Waverley Station at three p.m. next Monday. First-class carriage, of course. We'll have a runner meet you. Any questions?"

Isla looked around the silent, dusty room, at the porcelain cats and the ghost of a life that was rapidly receding in her rear-view mirror. "No," she lied. "No questions."

The pub was loud, sticky, and perfect. The Piper’s Rest smelled of spilt beer and hopeful desperation, the same as it did every Tuesday night. Kirsty slammed a pint of Tennent's down on their usual table, foam sloshing over the side. She was all sharp angles and sharper wit, her flame-red hair pulled back in a messy bun that defied physics. She’d been Isla’s boss, then her partner in their own two-woman firm, and now, her unofficial, unpaid, and brutally honest campaign manager.

"So, the posh London man-child called?" Kirsty asked, sliding into the booth opposite.

"Julian. Yes. He sounds like he was born wearing a cravat."

"Did he try and talk you out of the death dirge?"

Isla took a long pull of her lager. "He called it 'the folk song'. And no. But he wanted to."

"Good," Kirsty said, nodding with satisfaction. "Let 'em sweat. They want you to do another one of those Adele ballads. Safe. Boring. The Skye Boat Song, though... that's a proper kick in the teeth. It's you."

It *was* her. The song wasn’t a dirge, not the way she sang it. It was about passage, about leaving a shore behind for something new and terrifying. It was her entire life, a three-minute distillation of swapping a steady job for a clapped-out van, of starting her own business, of standing on a stage in front of millions with nothing but a guitar and a voice that always felt too big for her body.

"My step-sister thinks I should sing a pop song," Isla mumbled into her glass. "Something by Dua Lipa. Says it’s more 'marketable'."

Kirsty snorted. "Your step-sister thinks 'marketable' is a shade of beige you paint a feature wall. Chloe wouldn't know a good song if it climbed up her leg and bit her on the arse. She's already planning your life after you win, isn't she?"

Isla didn’t answer, which was an answer in itself. Chloe, her junior by five years, had embraced the BGT hurricane with the fervour of a zealot. Her Instagram, once a shrine to bottomless brunches and ill-advised fashion choices, was now a dedicated Isla Sparkes fan account, run with a frightening level of corporate strategy. #VoteIsla #ScottishSongbird #SparkySings. It was relentless.

"She's just excited," Isla said, a reflex defence.

"She's booking the open-top bus parade," Kirsty countered. "Look, you just worry about the song. I'll handle the logistics this end. The van needs its MOT, and Mrs Carmichael's downstairs loo is flickering again. The real world, remember it?" She grinned, raising her glass. "To the final. And to not letting the London wallies turn you into something you're not."

"I'll drink to that," Isla said, clinking her glass against Kirsty's. The cold beer was real. The sticky table was real. Kirsty’s unwavering, no-bullshit friendship was the most real thing of all. She clung to it like a safety harness.

The family dinner on Sunday was an exercise in managed chaos. Her dad, Ewan, a gentle giant of a man who’d spent forty years as a stonemason, was quietly, painfully proud. He kept patting her on the shoulder, his big, work-worn hand surprisingly soft, and saying, "My girl. Eh? My girl." Her step-mum, Sharon, Chloe’s mother, was a whirlwind of anxiety and misplaced enthusiasm, flapping around the kitchen and talking about what she’d wear to the final. "Something that doesn't clash with the seating, you know? You see some of the mothers on the telly and you just think, what were you thinking, hen?"

And then there was Chloe. She sat opposite Isla, her phone propped against a gravy boat, scrolling through websites on a tablet. She wore a white silk blouse that probably cost more than Isla’s entire monthly food budget.

"Okay, so I've had a thought," Chloe announced, as if unveiling a cure for the common cold. "Your 'brand'. It's all a bit... earthy."

Isla paused, a piece of roast potato halfway to her mouth. "I'm an electrician from Edinburgh. It's not a brand, it's my life."

"Exactly!" Chloe said, missing the point with surgical precision. "The whole 'singing sparky' thing is great, it got you here. But for the final? We need to elevate. I'm thinking less work boots, more... ethereal. A long, flowing white dress. Like a Celtic goddess rising from the mists of the Forth."

"I'll look like I've come adrift from a B&B ghost tour," Isla said flatly.

"It's about the narrative, Isla," Chloe pressed on, her voice gaining the patient, lecturing tone she used when explaining TikTok trends to her mother. "You're not just a woman singing a song. You are Scotland's lonely heart, calling from the shores of time."

Ewan choked on a swig of water. "Is that from a shortbread tin, love?"

"It's from a brainstorming session I had with myself, Dad," Chloe said, affronted. "This is important. The public needs a story. You win, and the machine starts. Endorsements, a record deal, a book... 'From Sparks to Stardom' by Isla Sparkes. We need to be ready."

*We.* The word hung in the air, heavier than the smell of burnt parsnips. Isla looked at her step-sister, at the genuine, ravenous excitement in her eyes. Chloe didn't just want Isla to win. She wanted to be the architect of the victory, the CEO of Isla Sparkes PLC. Isla felt a familiar, weary sadness settle in her chest. She loved Chloe, she did, in that complicated, cobbled-together way that step-families do. But they were tuned to different frequencies. Isla wanted to sing her song, to stand on that stage and feel the music vibrate through the soles of her feet, to connect with the thousands of unseen people in the dark. Chloe wanted to sell the sizzle before the steak had even seen the pan.

"I'm wearing my jeans," Isla said quietly. "And my black top. And my boots."

Chloe’s face fell. "But Isla, the optics—"

"The song is the only thing that matters," Isla interrupted, her voice firmer than she intended. "Not the dress, not the 'brand', and not the book deal. The song."

An uncomfortable silence descended, broken only by the scrape of Ewan’s fork against his plate. Sharon shot Isla a look that was half-pleading, half-admonishing. *Just humour her.* But Isla was tired of humouring her. This one thing, this one performance, had to be hers and hers alone.

Later that evening, back in the sanctuary of her small flat, she unclipped her guitar from its case. The wood was dark and scarred, bearing the dings and scratches of a hundred pub gigs and open mic nights. It felt like an extension of her own body. She sat on the edge of her sofa, the lights of Leith twinkling through the window, and began to play. The opening chords of 'The Skye Boat Song' filled the room. She didn't sing the sweet, lilting version everyone knew. Her arrangement was starker, more haunted. The chords were minor and brooding, the rhythm restless, like a boat fighting against a turning tide.

And when she finally opened her mouth to sing, the voice that came out was not the one that chatted to customers or haggled with suppliers. It was a different entity entirely. It was a voice dredged up from somewhere deep and old, a voice that held the grey of the Edinburgh sky, the sting of salt spray, the sorrow of a thousand goodbyes. "Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing, 'Onward!' the sailors cry..."

She sang for herself. She sang for the quiet pride in her dad’s eyes and the fierce loyalty in Kirsty’s. She sang for the woman who spent her days covered in plaster dust and the terrified, hopeful girl who was about to step onto the biggest stage in Britain. She sang until her throat was raw and her fingertips were tender. She sang until the story Chloe wanted to sell fell away, and all that was left was the truth of the song. This was her armour. This was her weapon. It was all she needed.

The following Monday, the BGT-branded holdall sat by her front door, looking sleek and alien next to her own scuffed guitar case. Inside the holdall was a baffling array of branded merchandise: a hoodie, a water bottle, a personalised satin dressing gown she couldn't imagine ever wearing. It felt like a costume for a person she hadn't yet become. She zipped it shut, her heart a frantic, thrumming drum against her ribs. Waverley Station. A first-class carriage. A runner. Julian. The final.

Her phone rang, shattering the quiet. The screen flashed: CHLOE. Isla braced herself for a last-minute lecture on posture or a new idea for a 'viral moment'. She took a breath and swiped to answer.

"Isla? You need to come. Now."

The voice wasn't Chloe's. It was a man's, tight with panic. There was a terrible cacophony in the background – sirens, shouting, the sickening sound of metal scraping on tarmac. Isla’s blood ran cold.

"Who is this? Where's Chloe?"

"My name is... I don't know, I just... I was in the car behind her. On the M8. There's been an accident. A bad one. She was on the phone, she said her sister's name was Isla... the ambulance is here now. They're taking her to the Royal Infirmary." The man's voice cracked. "You should get here. It looks... it looks really bad."The man's voice dissolved into the digital ether, but the words remained, branded into the sudden, terrifying silence of her flat. *Accident. M8. Royal Infirmary. Really bad.* The phone slipped from her grasp, clattering onto the floorboards. For a single, suspended moment, nothing moved. The BGT holdall stood by the door, a sleek black monolith to a future that had just ceased to exist. The satin dressing gown. The first-class ticket. #VoteIsla. It was all a language from another planet, gibberish in the face of this new, brutal reality.

The cold dread that had seeped into her veins turned to ice, then shattered into pure, frantic adrenaline. Her mind, usually a clear diagram of cause and effect, became a screaming chaos of unprocessed fear. Chloe. Chloe on the M8. Chloe, who had probably been scrolling through branding ideas or texting a PR contact about 'synergy'. Chloe, whose last words to Isla had been about the 'optics' of her jeans. A wave of nausea so profound it buckled her knees washed over Isla. She gripped the edge of the sofa, her knuckles white, her breath coming in ragged, useless gasps.

The van. She needed the van. Her keys. Where were her keys? She fumbled on the small table by the door, scattering a pile of mail. Her fingers closed around the familiar, cold metal. The van keys, her flat keys, and the small, tarnished silver charm of a treble clef Kirsty had given her for luck years ago. Luck. The thought was a bitter acid in her mouth. She snatched her wallet and phone, shoving them into the pockets of her jeans. Her eyes snagged on her guitar case, leaning against the wall like a silent, patient friend. She was supposed to be on a train. She was supposed to be playing that guitar in a soundcheck. Instead, she was running to a hospital where her sister might be...

She slammed the flat door behind her, the sound echoing in the empty stairwell. She didn't look back at the holdall or the life it represented. It was just baggage. Down the three flights of stairs she flew, her work boots thudding a frantic, desperate rhythm. Outside, the morning was grey and ordinary. A postman whistling, the distant rumble of traffic. How could the world look so normal when hers had just been ripped apart? She threw herself into the driver's seat of the van, the familiar scent of cable sheathing and bacon rolls doing nothing to soothe her. The engine turned over with a comforting, familiar grumble. She pulled away from the kerb with a squeal of tyres, her only thought a frantic, repeating prayer. *Let her be okay. Please, just let her be okay.*

The drive to the Royal Infirmary was a blur of red lights she barely saw and horns she didn't hear. Her mind played a cruel highlight reel of Chloe. Chloe at ten, with a gappy smile, teaching Isla how to do a cartwheel in the garden. Chloe at sixteen, crying in her room over a boy, letting Isla sit with her in silence when their mum just fluttered and fussed. Chloe last Sunday, her face alight with an ambition that Isla found irritating but also, in a strange way, dazzling. Chloe, who believed in the 'Isla Sparkes' brand more than Isla herself did. The argument over dinner felt like a physical blow now, a stupid, selfish squabble over something so utterly meaningless. *The song is the only thing that matters*. What a fool she'd been. Chloe mattered.

She found them in the relentlessly beige waiting room of the Accident and Emergency department. The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and anxiety. Sharon was a crumpled figure on a hard plastic chair, her face chalky and tear-streaked. The bright, floral scarf she wore seemed a cruel mockery of her state. Ewan stood beside her, his big stonemason's hand resting on her shoulder, his own face a grey mask of shock. He looked ten years older than he had at dinner last night. When he saw Isla, his composure cracked, and he took a half-step towards her, his expression one of utter desolation.

"Isla," he rasped, his voice rough with unshed tears. "She's in surgery. A lorry... it just... it didn't stop." He couldn't finish, just shook his head, the movement slow and heavy.

Sharon looked up, her eyes unfocused. "Her car... they said... Oh, God, Isla." She reached out a trembling hand. "She was so excited about London. She was on her way to the shops to buy a new outfit for the final. A 'showstopper', she said." A fresh wave of sobs racked her body, and she buried her face in her hands.

Isla knelt in front of her step-mum, taking the cold, trembling hand in both of her own. The warmth of her calloused palms, a testament to her life of practical, fixable problems, seemed to offer no comfort at all against this. This was a broken thing she had no tools to mend. "Is she... what did the doctors say?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

"It's her head," Ewan said, his voice hollow. "And her leg. A lot of internal... stuff. They said the first few hours are critical. That's all they'll say. 'Critical'." He spoke the word as if it were a foreign object, something foul he couldn't get out of his mouth. "We just have to wait."

And so they waited. The minutes stretched into an eternity, measured out by the quiet squeak of nurses' shoes and the distant, rhythmic beeping of machines that were keeping other people's loved ones alive. The frantic buzz of Isla's phone vibrated in her pocket. She pulled it out. The screen showed a dozen missed calls from 'Julian Syco' and a string of texts. *Isla, where are you? The runner is at the station. Call me URGENTLY.* *Isla, we're getting worried. Please get in touch.* *Isla, this is unprofessional. The whole schedule is being held up.* She stared at the words, at the name 'Julian Syco'. It was like reading a dispatch from a forgotten war, a life she had lived a century ago. With a numb finger, she powered the phone off and shoved it back into her pocket, severing the last connection to that world. There was no BGT. There was no final. There was only this room, and the terrible, silent space where Chloe should have been.The waiting room became their world, a purgatory of beige vinyl and stale air. Time lost its structure, becoming a viscous, slow-moving current. It was measured in the gurgle and hiss of the coffee machine, the rustle of Sharon’s tissues, and the heavy, rhythmic tread of Ewan’s boots as he paced a short, worn path by the windows. Isla sat motionless, a statue carved from dread. The vibrant, logical world of red-to-red and black-to-black had been replaced by a landscape of terrifying unknowns. A circuit was either complete or it was broken. But a person? A life? It could hang suspended in a state of horrifying uncertainty, neither one thing nor the other. Each time the double doors to the corridors swung open, their hearts would leap in unison, a frantic, painful spasm, only to sink again as a nurse or a porter passed by without a glance.

Kirsty arrived a few hours into their vigil, a splash of colour and solid reality in the grey wash of the hospital. She didn't fuss or offer platitudes. She just appeared at Isla’s side, pressing a warm cardboard cup into her hand. The coffee was strong and bitter, and it was the first thing Isla had been able to swallow since the phone call. Kirsty’s flame-red hair was escaping its bun, and there was a smudge of what looked like grease on her cheek, but her eyes were clear and steady. She took in the scene – Ewan’s grim pacing, Sharon’s crumpled form – with a single, assessing glance. She pulled up a chair next to Isla, their shoulders touching, a small, solid point of contact in a sea of fear.

"I finished up at Mrs Carmichael's," she said quietly, her voice a low, reassuring rumble. "The downstairs loo is sorted. And I cancelled the MOT for the van." She didn't ask about London. She didn't need to. Her presence was a silent statement: *The real world can wait. I’m here.* For the first time that day, Isla felt a prickle of tears behind her eyes. She leaned her head against Kirsty’s shoulder, the rough fabric of her work jacket a comforting anchor, and breathed in the familiar, earthy scent of her friend. It smelled like home.

It was late in the afternoon when a woman in green scrubs, her face etched with exhaustion but her eyes kind, finally approached them. "Family of Chloe Douglas?" she asked softly. They all stood up as one, a jangled mess of raw nerves. Ewan’s hand found Sharon’s, gripping it tightly. The doctor’s gaze rested on them, calm and direct. "I'm Dr Aris, the lead surgeon. The operation was complex, but Chloe is out of surgery now. We've managed to stop the internal bleeding and stabilise the fractures in her leg. However, the primary concern is the trauma to her head. We've had to place her in a medically induced coma to allow the swelling on her brain to reduce. She's been moved to the Intensive Care Unit. She's stable, for now. But I need to be very clear with you. The next forty-eight hours are critical."

A collective, shuddering breath of relief and terror filled the space between them. Not gone. Chloe was not gone. But she was not back, either. She was balanced on a knife’s edge, and the world was holding its breath. Sharon began to cry again, but this time it was a different sound, a thin, keening noise of hope fighting its way through despair. Ewan wrapped his arms around her, burying his face in her hair, his own large frame trembling. Isla just stood there, the doctor’s words echoing in her head. *Stable. Coma. Critical.* The terms were clinical, precise, yet they described an unimaginable fragility. She felt a profound, aching gratitude for this woman in green scrubs, a stranger who had held her sister’s life in her hands. "Thank you," Isla whispered, the words inadequate but all she had. The doctor gave a small, tired nod. "We're doing everything we can. You can see her, one at a time, in a little while."

The vigil moved from the general waiting area to the hushed, intimidating quiet of the ICU corridor. Through a small glass window in a heavy door, Isla could see a sliver of the room where Chloe lay, a world of humming machines and blinking lights tethered to her still form. It felt impossible that the vibrant, opinionated, whirlwind of a woman she knew could be contained in that stillness. The guilt was a physical weight now, pressing down on Isla’s chest, making it hard to breathe. *Scotland's lonely heart, calling from the shores of time.* Chloe's words, so theatrical and silly at the time, now felt like a prophecy. Chloe, who had been so determined to write Isla’s story, now had a story of her own being written for her by beeping monitors and IV drips. Isla realised, with a sickening clarity, that all of Chloe's meddling, her talk of 'brands' and 'narratives', was just her clumsy, misguided way of saying *I believe in you*. She had seen a light in Isla that Isla had never truly seen in herself, and she had been trying, in her own way, to make the rest of the world see it too.

While Ewan and Sharon took their turn to go in, Kirsty steered Isla towards a small, deserted alcove with a large window overlooking the hospital car park. The sun was setting, painting the Edinburgh sky in bruised shades of purple and orange. "Have you even thought about it?" Kirsty asked, her voice gentle but firm. "London. The show." Isla shook her head, not looking away from the window. The question felt obscene, like asking a drowning person if they remembered to file their taxes. "There's nothing to think about," she said. "I'm not going." It wasn't a decision, not really. It was a fact. The sky is blue. Water is wet. I am not leaving my sister's side to go and sing on television. It was the simplest, most fundamental truth in her universe right now.

Kirsty nodded, as if she'd expected no other answer. "Right," she said. "They'll be going mental down there. The posh man-child will probably spontaneously combust." She paused. "You need to tell them, Isla. Officially. Or they'll just keep calling, keep harassing your dad and Sharon. You need to shut the door so you can be here properly." Kirsty was right, of course. She was always right about the practical things. Leaving that connection open was like having a radio blaring static in a quiet chapel. It was an intrusion, a link to a world that no longer had any claim on her.

Later, sitting alone in the corridor while her parents took a short, exhausted walk, Isla finally powered her phone back on. It came to life with a furious series of buzzes and pings, a digital scream of missed deadlines and broken arrangements. Dozens of missed calls from Julian, from the BGT production office. A wall of texts, ranging from concerned to panicked to furious. A dozen voicemails she would never listen to. Ignoring all of it, she opened a new message. She typed in Julian’s number from memory, her fingers moving with a slow, deliberate surety. The message was short. There was no apology, no long explanation. The complexities of her family’s pain could not be condensed into a text message for a TV producer. She simply wrote: *'Family emergency. I can't come. I'm pulling out of the competition.'* She stared at the words for a moment. *Pulling out*. It sounded so final. She pressed send before she could second-guess it. The small 'delivered' notification appeared underneath. She felt a strange, hollow sense of peace. She had cut the line. The circuit was broken. Now, there was only one connection that mattered. She powered the phone off again and slipped it into her pocket, turning her full attention back to the small glass window, and the fragile, precious life on the other side.The days that followed were a long, seamless stretch of antiseptic time. Isla, Ewan, and Sharon existed in a strange, suspended reality, orbiting the quiet epicentre of Chloe’s room in the ICU. Their lives were dictated by the beeping of machines, the hushed conversations with nurses whose names they learned, and the starkly-lettered visiting hours on the door. Isla learned the rhythm of this new world: the morning handover when the night-shift doctor would brief the day team, the clatter of the lunch trolley in the corridor, the way the light from the window shifted across the linoleum floor, marking hours they felt but could no longer properly measure. The vibrant, demanding world outside the hospital walls faded to a distant hum.

Kirsty was their lifeline. She appeared each evening after work, a welcome blast of normality, her pockets seemingly full of everything they didn't know they needed: a phone charger, a packet of decent biscuits, a fresh pair of socks for Ewan, a trashy magazine for Sharon that went unread but was held like a talisman. She handled the outside world with brisk efficiency, fielding calls from concerned neighbours and rescheduling jobs for their business. She became a buffer, a firewall protecting their fragile bubble of grief. It was on the third day, as Kirsty was making them all a cup of tea in the relatives’ room, that Isla’s phone, which Kirsty had insisted on keeping charged, rang again. The screen lit up with ‘Julian Syco’. Before Isla could even react, Kirsty snatched it from the countertop.

"I've got this," she said, her expression hardening. She walked to the far corner of the room and answered, her voice low and tight. "Hello?" A pause. "No, this isn't Isla. This is her business partner." Another pause, during which Kirsty’s eyes narrowed. "No, she can't come to the phone. She's at the hospital. Her sister's been in a serious accident." Kirsty listened, her lips pressed into a thin line. "Look, Julian, I don't think you're getting it. This isn't a case of the flu. She's not coming. Not to London, not to the final, not to anything. It's over." She was quiet for a moment longer, her face a thundercloud. "A breach of contract? Are you bloody serious? A young woman is lying in intensive care and you're talking about contracts?" Her voice, though still quiet, had taken on a dangerous edge, the flinty tone she used on suppliers who tried to overcharge them. "Do whatever you have to do. But if you or anyone from your show calls this number again, I will personally find out where your glass-walled office is and I will rewire it so that your state-of-the-art headset gives you a jolt every time you say the word 'darling'. Are we clear?" She ended the call without waiting for a reply and tossed the phone onto a sofa cushion as if it were contaminated. "Wanker," she muttered, before turning back to the kettle, her fury radiating in the small room. Isla felt a fierce, protective love for her friend. Kirsty was her earth wire, grounding her when the voltage of life became too much to bear.

Later that day, they got a sliver of hope. While Isla was sitting by Chloe’s bedside, her hand resting gently on her sister’s unmoving arm, she saw it. A flicker of her eyelashes. It was barely perceptible, a tiny, involuntary movement. Her heart hammered against her ribs. She leaned closer, her breath held tight in her chest. "Chloe? Can you hear me, hen? It's Isla." There was nothing more. Just the steady, rhythmic puff of the ventilator and the metronomic beep of the heart monitor. But it was something. It was a spark in the darkness. When she told the nurse, the woman smiled kindly but cautiously. "It could be an involuntary reflex, but it's a good sign. It shows there's activity. We'll keep a close eye on it." A good sign. The two words were a balm on Isla's raw soul. It wasn't a complete circuit, not yet, but it was a current, however faint.

The news broke on the fifth day. Kirsty saw it first, scrolling through her phone while they sat in the hospital coffee shop. "Ah, hell," she said softly. She turned the screen towards Isla. A headline from a popular news site read: 'BGT FINALIST ISLA SPARKES QUITS SHOW DAYS BEFORE FINAL'. The article was a mash-up of official statements and wild speculation. A spokesperson for the show had given a terse "no comment on the contestant's private matters," which only fuelled the rumour mill. The comments section was a cesspit of opinions: she was arrogant, she'd buckled under the pressure, she'd had a better offer, she was letting Scotland down. The #SparkySings hashtag was now attached to messages of confusion and anger. Isla felt a strange detachment, as if reading about someone else. The 'Scottish Songbird' they were all talking about had ceased to exist the moment she'd answered that panicked phone call. That person, with her dreams of a record deal and her fears about a TV final, was a ghost.

That evening, when Kirsty arrived, she wasn't carrying biscuits or magazines. She was carrying Isla's scarred and battered guitar case. She set it down by the chair where Isla was sitting, in the quiet corridor outside the ICU. "I thought you might need this," she said simply. Isla stared at it. The case was an artefact from her other life, a life of noisy pubs and hopeful songs. She hadn't thought of it, hadn't missed it. But seeing it now, she felt a deep, pulling ache. It was her language, her tool. The one thing in the world she knew how to use to make sense of the things that had no sense. "I can't," she whispered, shaking her head. "Play? Here?" "There's a chapel on the ground floor," Kirsty said, pre-empting the objection. "It's always empty at this time of night. No one will bother you." She squeezed Isla's shoulder. "You've got all these wires crossed inside you, Isla. You need to straighten them out. Go on."

An hour later, after Ewan and Sharon had gone to try and get some rest at a nearby hotel, Isla found herself pushing open the heavy wooden door to the hospital chapel. It was a small, circular room, quiet and still, smelling faintly of floor polish and old hymn books. It wasn't a place she would normally seek out, but tonight its profound silence felt like a sanctuary. She unclipped her guitar case. The familiar scent of old wood and metal strings rose to meet her. Her guitar felt solid and real in her hands, an extension of herself. Her fingertips, which had become soft from days of anxious waiting, found their old places on the frets. She didn't think about what to play. Her hands knew. The opening chords of 'The Skye Boat Song' filled the empty chapel. They were different tonight. Slower, more hesitant, drenched in a sorrow that went bone-deep. She took a ragged breath and began to sing, her voice a raw, hushed thing. "Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing, 'Onward!' the sailors cry..." The words were no longer about a prince escaping over the sea. They were a prayer. A desperate, urgent plea sent out into the quiet of the hospital. It was a song for Chloe. A call for her to make the perilous journey from the shores of that silent, comatose country back to them. Her voice cracked on the high notes, breaking with a pain she had held inside for days. She wasn't performing. She was testifying. She sang for the sister who had believed in her brand, for the annoying, infuriating, dazzling girl who was fighting for her life in a room of machines two floors above. She sang of passage, of leaving a shore behind, of the terrifying hope for a safe arrival. She sang until the last chord faded into the stillness of the room, leaving only the sound of her own shaky breathing. She rested her forehead against the cool wood of the guitar, tears finally streaming down her face, hot and silent. The circuit inside her, broken and sparking with grief and guilt, finally felt complete again. It didn't fix anything, but it made the darkness bearable. It was her armour. It was her weapon. It was all she had.The walk back from the chapel was like surfacing from a deep dive. Isla felt scoured out, her limbs heavy, but the frantic, high-frequency panic in her chest had subsided, replaced by a profound, aching quiet. The tears had been a release, washing away the fine silt of guilt and unspoken fear that had been clouding her every thought. When she returned to the ICU corridor, Kirsty was waiting, a silent sentinel by the door. She didn't ask how it went. She just handed Isla a bottle of water. "Drink," she commanded gently. Isla obeyed, the cool liquid a relief to her raw throat. She had sung her grief into the silent stones of the chapel, and in return, the silence had given her a small piece of herself back.

The next morning, Dr. Aris found them in their usual seats. Her expression was cautiously optimistic. "The swelling has reduced to a point where we're comfortable," she explained, her voice calm and measured. "We're going to slowly decrease Chloe's sedation and see if she can begin to surface on her own. It's a gradual process, and we don't know what to expect. She may be confused, agitated, or she may remain unresponsive for a while longer. We just have to be patient and let her lead the way." The news sent a fresh jolt of terrified hope through them. It was the next step, a move forward from the dreadful stasis, but it was also a step into a new and profound unknown. What part of Chloe would come back to them? The waiting changed. It was no longer a passive vigil but an active, breathless anticipation, every slight change in the rhythm of the machines, every twitch of Chloe's sleeping face, laden with meaning.

That Friday night was the final. The fact landed in Isla’s awareness with a strange lack of impact, a piece of information that had no relevance to her current coordinates. She, Kirsty, Ewan, and Sharon were gathered in the relatives’ room, a small, worn-out space that had become as familiar as their own living rooms. The television in the corner was on, its volume a muted drone. Someone had left it tuned to the right channel. Isla glanced up and saw the glittering, bombastic opening sequence of the show, a montage of weeping contestants and ecstatic judges. It was like watching a home video from a stranger’s wedding. She saw her own face flash on screen for a second, a grainy clip from her audition, her expression earnest and terrified. The woman on the screen, the ‘singing sparky from Leith’, was a ghost.

Kirsty watched Isla, her expression vigilant. But Isla felt nothing. No regret, no longing. Just a vast, clinical distance. The host, all sequins and smiles, made a brief announcement. "We're all thinking of Isla Sparkes tonight, who sadly had to withdraw for personal reasons. We wish her and her family all the very best." And that was it. She was a footnote. The show moved on, a relentless machine of manufactured emotion. Isla watched for a few minutes more as the first finalist, a troupe of impossibly synchronised child dancers, took to the stage. She saw the judges' faces, the cheering crowd, the slick camera work. She saw the world that Chloe had so desperately wanted for her. The world of narratives and optics and branding. It looked so flimsy, so breakable.

"Can we turn this over?" she asked quietly, her gaze shifting to her dad, who was staring blankly at the screen. "Maybe 'Pointless' is on another channel." Ewan started, as if waking from a trance, and fumbled for the remote. Kirsty gave Isla a small, almost imperceptible nod of approval. The real final, the only one that mattered, was taking place in a quiet, dimly lit room down the corridor, scored not by a live orchestra but by the steady beep of a heart monitor. The grand prize wasn't a cheque and a spot at the Royal Variety Performance; it was the hope of a flicker, a squeeze, a single conscious breath.

Later that night, Isla took her turn to sit with Chloe alone. The sedation had been lowered, and the room felt charged with a new, potent silence. The ventilator still breathed for her, a gentle, rhythmic puff, but the landscape of her stillness felt different, closer to the surface. Isla pulled her chair close to the bed, taking her sister's hand. It was cool and limp. She started talking, a low, rambling monologue that had become her ritual. "Kirsty says the van is making a funny noise again, a sort of clunking sound when you change into third. Reckons it's the gearbox. You know she's just saying that because she wants me to let her have a proper look under the bonnet. And Mrs Carmichael’s prize cat, the big ginger one, fell off the mantelpiece. Don't worry," she added quickly, "it didn't break. Landed on a dust sheet. Apparently it gave her such a fright she drank a whole sherry before lunchtime."

She talked on, filling the sterile air with the mundane, comforting details of a life that felt a million miles away, weaving a thread of words for Chloe to follow back. She was describing the peeling floral wallpaper in the Carmichael house when it happened. Chloe's eyes, the same vibrant blue Isla saw in her own reflection, opened. They were hazy, unfocused, clouded with drugs and trauma, but they were undeniably open. They drifted vaguely around the room before settling, with a flicker of something like recognition, on Isla's face. Isla’s heart seized in her chest. Her words died in her throat. She could only stare, her own eyes filling with tears.

Chloe's brows furrowed in a flicker of confusion. Her mouth moved, a small, frustrated gesture against the tube that snaked into her throat. A weak, guttural sound came from deep in her chest. It was the most beautiful sound Isla had ever heard. Her thumb, which had been frozen on the call button, finally pressed down hard. She didn't take her eyes off Chloe's face, not even for a second. "I'm here," she whispered, her voice thick and unsteady. "I'm right here, Chloe. You're okay."

When the nurse hurried in, followed moments later by a shell-shocked Ewan and Sharon, she found them like that: a tableau of stunned, tearful relief. The checks the nurse performed were a blur to Isla. All she could see were Chloe’s eyes, a fragile, miraculous window opening back into the world. The nurse, a kind woman named Mary, smiled. "Well now, look who's decided to rejoin us." She looked at Isla. "Keep talking to her. Your voice is the best medicine she can have right now." Isla nodded, unable to speak. She felt Chloe’s fingers, which had been limp in her grasp for a week, tighten. It was a faint pressure, a ghost of her sister’s former strength, but it was deliberate. It was a connection. It was an answer. The circuit, broken and frayed, was finally, painstakingly, being repaired. Red to red. Black to black. And in that moment, Isla knew she hadn't lost a prize. She had won everything.The days that followed Chloe’s reawakening were a slow crawl into a new kind of daylight. The move from the hushed, intimidating sanctity of the Intensive Care Unit to a noisy, four-bed room on the neuro-rehabilitation ward felt like a momentous migration. The constant, ominous beeping of the ICU was replaced by the clatter of meal trolleys, the drone of daytime television from a neighbouring bay, and the cheerful, non-urgent chatter of the nurses. It was the sound of life, messy and mundane, and it was the most beautiful music Isla had ever heard. Chloe was still tethered to an IV drip, and her leg was encased in a formidable cage of metal and plaster, but the ventilator was gone. The most vital connection had been re-established: she was breathing on her own.

Recovery, however, was not a straight line. It was a tangled, frustrating diagram of crossed wires and short circuits. The confident, articulate woman who had been planning Isla’s media strategy was gone, replaced by a frightened, fragile version who struggled to find her words. The head trauma had left her with expressive aphasia. The thoughts were there, Isla could see them raging in the frantic intelligence of Chloe's eyes, but they would get lost on the journey to her mouth, dissolving into a jumble of incorrect words or pure, frustrated silence. A simple request for water might come out as "need the... the floor... cold." It was a cruel, specific kind of prison for someone who had always used language as both a weapon and a shield. The 'CEO of Isla Sparkes PLC' could no longer reliably ask for a cup of tea.

Isla adapted with the same methodical patience she applied to a complex wiring job. She became Chloe’s interpreter, her memory, her advocate. She learned to read the subtle grammar of her sister's expressions: the slight furrow of her brow that meant pain, the flicker of her eyes towards the window that meant boredom, the tightening of her jaw that signaled the onset of a fresh wave of frustration. She cut up Chloe's food into manageable bites, communicated with the physiotherapists about the gruelling exercises for her leg, and spent hours just sitting, filling the silence not with chatter, but with a calm, unwavering presence that said *I'm not going anywhere*. The brand strategist in Chloe might have been offline, but the sister was still there, and Isla was determined to coax her back out.

Kirsty came one evening, a few weeks after the accident, and found Isla patiently holding up flashcards with simple images on them. "House," Isla said, pointing to the picture. Chloe looked at it, her face a mask of concentration. "Home," she managed, the word soft but clear. Isla beamed, a brilliant, unselfconscious smile. "That's it, hen! That's the one." Kirsty leaned against the doorframe, a faint smile on her own face. "The little ginger kid won, by the way," she said, by way of greeting. Isla looked up, momentarily confused. "BGT," Kirsty clarified. "The dancing one. Apparently he’s going to be the new face of a breakfast cereal. You’ve been replaced by a nine-year-old in a sparkly waistcoat." Isla just shook her head, a small laugh escaping her. The news had all the impact of a weather report from another continent. It simply didn't matter. Her world had shrunk to the size of this room, to the small, monumental victory of a single correct word.

One quiet afternoon, when their parents had gone home for a much-needed rest and the ward was in a post-lunch lull, Isla brought her guitar in. She didn't ask permission. She just propped the door slightly ajar, sat on the visitor's chair, and unclipped the case. Chloe watched her from the bed, her expression unreadable. Isla's fingers, which had grown accustomed to holding plastic flashcards and adjusting pillows, felt clumsy at first on the familiar frets. She didn’t play the haunted, raw version of 'The Skye Boat Song' she had performed in the chapel. Instead, she played it the old way, the sweet, lilting version her dad used to hum when she was a child. It was a simple, uncomplicated melody, a lullaby. She didn't sing, she just let the notes speak for her, filling the small space with a tune that was woven into the fabric of their shared childhood. She played for the girl who had taught her to do cartwheels, the teenager who had cried over a boy, the young woman who had seen a star in her and tried to show it to the world. When she finished, the final chord hanging in the air, she looked up. Chloe’s face was wet with tears, but she was smiling. A real, tremulous smile. She lifted a shaky hand and pointed to Isla, then to her own heart. The meaning was perfectly clear. No interpretation needed. The circuit was complete.

The road ahead was long, a winding, uncertain path of physiotherapy, speech therapy, and relearning a world that had become alien. But the foundation was solid. The house of their family, which had been shaken to its core, was standing firm. One afternoon, Isla sat on the edge of Chloe's bed, a notepad and a pen between them. Chloe’s hand, guided by Isla's, was attempting to form the letters of her own name. Her grip was weak, the pen wavering, but she was trying. Isla’s calloused, capable fingers, so used to connecting wires and completing circuits, were steady around Chloe's, guiding the flow of ink, teaching her muscles a language they had forgotten. It was slow, painstaking work. It was logical. It was predictable. You started with a broken connection, and you worked, patiently and with purpose, until it was whole again. It was a language Isla understood. It was, she realised, the only song that had ever truly mattered.The scent of bleach and over-brewed tea had replaced the dust and ozone of Mrs Carmichael’s townhouse. Two months had passed since the accident, and the world had shrunk to the dimensions of her dad and Sharon’s semi-detached house in Corstorphine. Isla’s new perch was not a stepladder but the arm of a chintz sofa, her focus not on a ceiling rose but on Chloe’s hand as it struggled to grip a television remote. From this vantage point, the world was a canvas of physiotherapy worksheets taped to the wall and a dauntingly complicated pill organiser on the coffee table. Chloe, her leg still in a metal brace but now free of the main cast, sat in a wheelchair, her expression a thunderous mask of concentration as she tried to change the channel. The button for ‘up’ remained stubbornly un-pressed.

“It’s… stuck,” Chloe eventually managed, the words slow and slurred, each one a small, hard-won victory. Her blue eyes, once so quick and sharp, were clouded with a frustration so profound it was almost a physical presence in the room. She looked at the remote as if it were a mortal enemy. Isla’s fingers twitched with the urge to just do it for her, an impulse she had to fight a dozen times an hour. The speech therapist had been clear: let her try, let her fail, let her find the new pathways herself. It was the hardest thing Isla had ever had to do, harder than any live performance or complex rewiring job. She was an expert at fixing things, and here she was, instructed to simply watch something stay broken. “Try with your thumb,” Isla suggested gently. “More power in the thumb.”

Kirsty’s arrival was, as always, like a window being thrown open in a stuffy room. She blew in on a gust of damp Edinburgh air, smelling of petrol and cold metal, her flame-red hair escaping its knot in vibrant tendrils. She didn't bring flowers or platitudes. She brought the business. Dropping a kiss on the top of Chloe’s head, she marched to the dining table and unloaded the contents of her bag: the job book, a stack of invoices, and the greasy, dog-eared copy of the van’s service manual. The items looked like relics from another civilisation, laid out on the polished wood of Sharon’s table. "Right," Kirsty said, turning to Isla. "We need to talk."

Isla’s stomach tightened. She knew this was coming. For two months, Kirsty had been a saint, a one-woman band running a two-woman firm, putting out fires and placating clients with a string of increasingly inventive excuses. But the well of goodwill was running dry. "Look," Kirsty said, her voice softer than her usual bluntness but just as direct. "I've held them off as long as I can. But that new contract for the café chain in the New Town, the one we busted our arses to get? They're going to give it to Paterson's if we don't start next week. And Mrs Carmichael’s security light is still on the fritz. She thinks there's a badger setting it off and she’s threatening to buy an air rifle." She sighed, running a hand through her messy hair. "I can't do it alone, Isla. We're not a business anymore. We're a charity case."

"I can't," Isla said automatically, her gaze flicking to Chloe, who was now staring at the two of them, her attempt at the remote abandoned. "Look at her, Kirsty. She needs me." It was a reflex, a truth that had become the central pillar of her existence. How could she possibly worry about Paterson’s Electrical when Chloe couldn’t make a cup of tea without the risk of scalding herself? How could a faulty security light compare to the terror of watching her sister struggle to form a sentence? "She's my priority," Isla finished, her voice quiet but fierce.

A slow, scraping sound made them both turn. Chloe was pushing the wheels of her chair, propelling herself over to the dining table. She looked from the job book to Isla's tense face, then to Kirsty's worried one. Her expression was one of grim determination. She pointed a trembling finger at the ledgers. "Kirsty…" she said, the name coming out with effort. "…Right." Then her finger moved to jab in Isla’s direction. "You. Go." Isla opened her mouth to argue, but Chloe held up a hand, a gesture so reminiscent of her old, imperious self that it made Isla's breath catch. Chloe took a deep, shaky breath, her eyes locking with Isla's. "You spark 'em." She paused, a flicker of a smile, exhausted but real, touching her lips. "I… watch… telly."

The simple, mangled sentence hit Isla with the force of a physical blow. It was an echo of their old life, a joke from a world before the M8 and the Royal Infirmary. It was an order. But more than that, it was a gift. It was Chloe, from inside her cage of broken words and a broken body, telling Isla that it was okay to have a life beyond these four walls. It was Chloe setting her free. A lump formed in Isla's throat and she could only nod, unable to trust her own voice. Kirsty, sensing the shift, clapped her hands together softly. "Right then," she said, her own voice thick with emotion. "First job, eight a.m. Monday. The new coffee shop on George Street. They want vintage filament bulbs everywhere. You’ll love it."

The following Monday felt profoundly strange, like putting on a costume she hadn’t worn in years. Her work boots felt heavy, the denim of her jeans stiff. The van, however, smelled like coming home. The familiar chaos of cable ties, terminal blocks, and the faint, lingering scent of a half-eaten packet of crisps was a balm to her soul. As Kirsty navigated the morning traffic, Isla found herself checking her phone every two minutes, a knot of anxiety tightening in her gut. But there were no calls from Sharon, no panicked texts. Just the city sliding past the window and the easy, comfortable silence between her and her best friend. The work itself was a revelation. Inside the shell of the new café, surrounded by the smell of fresh plaster and sawdust, her hands rediscovered their old intelligence. Stripping a wire, housing a connection, reading the elegant logic of a wiring diagram – it was a language her body had never forgotten. For hours at a time, she thought of nothing but currents and connections, of making things work, of bringing light to a dark space. It was a profound, uncomplicated relief.

They were grabbing a late lunch in a small sandwich bar when it happened. A young woman, holding her phone up, approached their table. "Oh my God, I'm so sorry to bother you," she gushed, "but you're Isla Sparkes, aren't you? The singer from BGT? Can I get a selfie? My mum was gutted when you dropped out." Isla looked up from her cheese and pickle sandwich, a smear of chutney on her cheek. She saw not just the girl, but the life she had turned her back on, reflected in the girl’s star-struck eyes. The ghost of 'Isla Sparkes, the Scottish Songbird' stood beside their table. Isla gave a small, polite smile. "That was another lifetime, I think," she said gently. "I'm just an electrician." The girl's face fell, confused by the polite but absolute dismissal. "Oh. Right," she stammered, and after a moment of awkward silence, she retreated. Kirsty watched her go, then looked at Isla and raised her can of Irn-Bru in a silent toast. "To the electrician," she said, a wide grin spreading across her face.

When Isla got back to the house that evening, exhausted and smelling of dust, she was braced for a report of a difficult day, of frustration and tears. But the house was quiet. Sharon intercepted her in the hall, a finger to her lips. "She's sleeping," she whispered, her face alight. "But you have to see this." She led Isla into the small back sitting room. On the little table next to the wheelchair, there were two mugs. One was half-full of cold tea. The other was empty, but for the dark dregs at the bottom. Beside them, the television remote lay on top of a dog-eared TV guide, which was open to the page for nature documentaries. Chloe had not only managed to make herself a cup of tea, she had made one for Isla, too. It was a small, everyday miracle. Isla picked up the cold mug, her fingertips tracing its rim. This was a different kind of connection, a different kind of circuit. It wasn't a performance for millions; it was a cup of tea, made with excruciating effort, for one. And as she stood there in the quiet house, the day's honest ache in her muscles, Isla knew with a certainty that settled bone-deep, that this was the most valuable prize she could ever have won.The autumn sunlight, thin and golden, slanted across the Water of Leith. Isla kicked a spray of rust-coloured leaves from the path, the crisp air a welcome shock to the system after a long day wrestling with the ancient fuse box of a Georgian hotel. Beside her, Chloe moved with a deliberate, uneven rhythm, her right hand resting on the smooth black handle of a walking cane. The heavy metal brace was gone, replaced by a smaller, more discreet support hidden beneath her jeans. The limp was pronounced, especially now that she was growing tired, but she was walking. She was walking beside her sister, through a park, under her own steam. Six months ago, this simple act would have been an impossible fantasy.

"He... said... my glutes are... lazy," Chloe announced, the sentence constructed with the painstaking care of a bomb disposal expert. She tapped her right hip with her free hand for emphasis. "The physio. Gavin. Cheeky."

Isla grinned. "Gavin's got a point. You always did try and get out of walking up the hill to the castle."

Chloe shot her a look, a flash of her old, sharp-witted self. "It's a... tourist... trap." The words were slow, but the sentiment was pure, undiluted Chloe. The aphasia was a persistent fog, thickening with fatigue or frustration, but the bright, stubborn light of her personality was shining through more and more. She had regained much of her vocabulary, but the words still sometimes played hide-and-seek, leaving her stranded mid-sentence, her eyes flashing with a silent, inward rage. Isla had learned to wait, to let the silence stretch, to give her the space to find the path back to her own thoughts.

Their new normal had settled into a routine. Isla and Kirsty worked, their business now more successful than ever, bolstered by a strange, unasked-for notoriety. Isla would come home to the Corstorphine house not to a patient, but to a sister who was slowly, fiercely, reclaiming her life. Chloe’s days were a gruelling schedule of therapies and exercises, her evenings spent watching documentaries with a furious concentration or battling her way through a chapter of a book, a dictionary permanently at her side. The house was filled with the evidence of her fight: post-it notes with single words stuck to objects, scribbled lists, the faint but constant background noise of a speech therapy app on her tablet.

As they reached the small stone bridge that arched over the water, Chloe stopped, leaning heavily on her cane. She watched a dog chase a stick into the shallows, its barks echoing in the quiet air. "I want... to work," she said, without looking at Isla. The words were quiet, but they landed with the weight of a formal declaration. Isla's immediate, instinctive reaction was a jolt of pure panic, an ice-cold wave of *no*. Work? The Chloe who had once navigated complex client negotiations with dazzling speed now struggled to remember the word for 'kettle'. How could she possibly work?

"Maybe in a few months, hen," Isla said, her voice softer and more cautious than she intended. "When you're a bit stronger. There's no rush."

Chloe turned to face her, and the frustration that simmered constantly beneath her surface boiled over. "No rush? For you!" she snapped, her voice rising, the words coming in a sudden, angry torrent that immediately exhausted her. "My life is... is... slow motion! You go. You fix. You... have a life. I sit. I wait. I am... a plant. You... water." The metaphor was devastatingly accurate. The anger in her eyes was quickly replaced by the sheen of tears, not of self-pity, but of sheer, impotent fury. "I am not... glass," she whispered, turning away to stare back at the water.

The words stung, sharp and true. Isla had wrapped her in cotton wool, had built a safe, predictable world around her, and in doing so, had inadvertently built the walls of her prison a little higher. She saw her as fragile, a project to be managed, a circuit to be carefully protected from a power surge. She was still treating the Chloe from the ICU, not the woman standing beside her now, a woman who was desperate to feel the current of her own life again, however weak. "You're right," Isla said quietly, the admission costing her a pang of guilt. "You're not glass. What... what do you want to do?"

The conversation hung between them, unresolved, for the rest of the walk. Back at her own small flat in Leith that evening, the familiar space felt different. It was a refuge she had clung to, the one place that was solely hers, but tonight it felt too quiet, too separate. The conflict with Chloe had unsettled her, dislodged the careful equilibrium she had constructed. She unclipped her guitar from its case, the worn wood a familiar comfort in her hands. She began to play, not a song, just a series of complex, restless chords, minor and unresolved. She was trying to work something out, to translate the tangled wires of guilt and fear and love into a language she could understand.

It was in the middle of this musical soul-searching that an email pinged on her laptop. She almost ignored it, but the subject line caught her eye: 'Skye Boat Song'. Her heart gave a familiar, unwelcome lurch. Thinking it was another piece of bizarre fan mail or a belated legal threat from Syco, she opened it with a sense of weary dread. But it was from neither. The name at the bottom was Alistair Macleod, and the company was Lismore Records, a small, fiercely independent label based in Glasgow that was legendary in folk music circles. They were the real deal, a label that cared more for artistry than for album charts. The email was short, respectful, and to the point. He had heard a rumour, from a sound engineer who had worked on BGT, of an astonishing a cappella performance of 'The Skye Boat Song' during a closed rehearsal. He wrote that he was putting together a compilation album called 'Echoes of the North', featuring contemporary artists reinterpreting traditional Scottish songs. He wanted to know if she would be interested in recording her arrangement. There was no mention of a five-album deal, of 'marketability' or 'brands'. Just a simple, direct question about the music itself. He finished by saying, *'It's a long shot, I know. But a song like that deserves to be heard.'*

Isla read the email three times. A long shot. It felt like a lifetime ago that she had stood on a stage and sung that song, her voice filling a vast, empty arena. She had poured her entire life, her passage from one shore to another, into that performance. Then the accident had happened, and that part of her, the singer, had been packed away, locked in a case with the satin dressing gown and the BGT holdall. To even consider opening it again felt like a betrayal. Her life was here. Her life was jobs with Kirsty and post-it notes on the fridge and worrying every time Chloe picked up a knife to butter her toast. How could she possibly make room for this? She closed the laptop, her heart thudding a nervous, syncopated rhythm. The song, it seemed, wasn't finished with her yet.The email sat on Isla’s laptop screen, a small, luminous rectangle of possibility in the quiet dark of her flat. It was a ghost at the feast, a voice from a life she had deliberately and painfully interred. Lismore Records. Alistair Macleod. 'Echoes of the North'. The words were so different from the polished, corporate language of Syco, yet they were somehow more terrifying. Julian’s world of 'bonkers numbers' and 'optics' had been easy to reject because it felt fundamentally false, a costume she had never wanted to wear. But this… this was an invitation to be the person she actually was, the person she had been before the sequined chaos of television had found her. It felt more dangerous because it felt more real. Her finger hovered over the delete key. One click and it would be gone. The song could go back in its box, her life could remain this simple, manageable circuit: work, home, Chloe. It was a safe, predictable current. But Chloe’s words from the park echoed in her ears, a sharp, discordant note in her carefully constructed peace. *'I am… a plant. You… water.'* Was this safety just another form of cage, for both of them?

She slammed the laptop shut and grabbed her keys, the decision to move made before the thought was fully formed. The ten-minute walk to Kirsty's flat was a blur of familiar streets, the chill night air doing nothing to cool the frantic heat in her chest. She let herself in with the key Kirsty insisted she keep, and found her friend sprawled on a worn leather sofa, surrounded by technical manuals and eating cold noodles straight from a takeaway carton. The television was showing a documentary about deep-sea welding. Kirsty looked up, took in Isla’s pale, haunted expression, and muted the TV without a word. "What's wrong? Is it Chloe?"

"No. Yes. I don't know," Isla stammered, pacing the small living room, unable to be still. "She said I'm treating her like a plant. Like she's made of glass. And she's right." She stopped, running her hands through her hair in a gesture of pure agitation. "And then I got this." She pulled out her phone, found the email, and thrust it at Kirsty, unable to articulate what it was. Kirsty took the phone, her expression shifting from concern to intense concentration as she read. She read it twice, then slowly lowered the phone, her gaze sharp and penetrating. "Alistair Macleod?" she said, her voice filled with a reverence Isla had only ever heard her use for vintage motorcycles and perfectly executed dovetail joints. "Isla, he's a legend. He recorded the first album by The Corbies. The actual Corbies."

"I know who he is," Isla said, her voice tight. "That's what makes it worse."

"Worse?" Kirsty sat bolt upright, noodles forgotten. "Are you hearing yourself? This isn't some London man-child trying to turn you into a pop puppet. This is a proper music person, asking you, because of your music, to record a song for a proper album. This is the thing you've always wanted, since we were fifteen and you were trying to learn 'Blackbird' in my mum's garage." She stood up and came to stand in front of Isla, her energy fierce and focused. "This isn't about BGT. This has nothing to do with it. This is about you. The electrician who sings. The woman who can make a whole pub full of old drunks shut up and weep into their pints with just her voice and that battered old guitar."

"I can't, Kirsty," Isla whispered, the words feeling thin and weak in the face of Kirsty's conviction. "My place is with her. What if she needs me? What if something happens while I'm in a studio in Glasgow for a day? What if she thinks I'm choosing this over her?" The fears, unspoken until now, came tumbling out, a chaotic mess of guilt and anxiety.

Kirsty put her hands on Isla's shoulders, her grip firm and grounding. "Listen to me. Chloe called you out today. She told you she's not made of glass. She's fighting for her life back, and you're stood here trying to wrap her in bubble wrap. What do you think she'll say when you tell her about this? You think she'll want you to say no? The girl who set up an Instagram fan account and live-tweeted your audition? She'll probably try to fire you from the job of being her carer." Kirsty’s eyes softened. "You've been in that hospital, in that house, for six months, Isla. You've been her rock. But a rock doesn't have to bury itself to be strong. You can't just pour everything you are into her. You'll have nothing left for yourself. And what's she going to do when she's better? Spend the rest of her life looking after the empty shell of her sister? You need to do this. Not just for you. But for her, too. To show her that life goes on. That you can both start living again."

The next afternoon, Isla found Chloe in the back garden, sitting in a deckchair with a blanket over her knees, her face tilted towards the weak autumn sun. The dictionary and a well-thumbed copy of a crime novel lay on the grass beside her. The air was still and quiet, broken only by the distant hum of traffic. Isla pulled up another chair, her heart thumping a slow, heavy rhythm. She didn’t know where to begin. She talked about work for a while, about the hotel’s wiring, about how Kirsty had managed to get a discount on a bulk order of cable. Chloe listened, nodding in the right places, her gaze distant. Finally, Isla took a breath. "I got an email. Yesterday."

Chloe turned her head, her attention snagged. "Work?"

"No," Isla said. "Music." She explained, slowly and simply, about Lismore Records, about Alistair Macleod, about the album of traditional songs. She was careful to keep her voice neutral, to present it as a strange curiosity, a faint echo from another world. She didn't want to invest it with her own hope or fear, she just wanted to lay it out as a fact. When she finished, Chloe was silent for a long time, her expression unreadable. She looked down at her own hands, lying still in her lap. Isla’s stomach twisted into a knot of dread. She had been wrong. It was too soon. It was selfish. "It's a stupid idea," Isla said quickly, moving to retreat. "I'll just tell him no. It's not important."

"Stop," Chloe said, her voice low but firm. She looked up, and the frustration that Isla had seen in the park yesterday was back, but this time it was directed entirely at her. She pointed a finger at Isla, her hand trembling slightly with the effort. "You are… so… stupid." The insult, delivered with such painstaking effort, was more potent than any shout. "This is it," Chloe continued, her eyes blazing. "This is… the reason. Not the… glitter… show. The song. Your song." She took a deep, shuddering breath, marshaling her thoughts. "I… sat. In that… chair. And I thought… my life… is over. And I watched you. Go to work. Get… dusty. And I thought… her life… is not over." A single tear traced a path down her cheek. "If you… say no… you make me… a prison. My fault. All my fault." She jabbed a finger towards the house, towards Isla's guitar case leaning in the hall. "Go. Get. Sing. Now."

The force of it left Isla speechless. Chloe wasn't just giving her permission; she was issuing a command. She was refusing to be the reason Isla's life stayed small. She was pushing her sister off the shore, just as Isla had pushed her. Half an hour later, Isla sat on the living room floor, her guitar across her lap, facing Chloe in her deckchair. The back door was open to the garden, and the cool air carried the scent of damp earth. Isla’s fingers were shaking as she found the opening chords to 'The Skye Boat Song'. She played her own arrangement, the one that was stark and haunted and full of restless, minor chords. Then she opened her mouth to sing, her voice cracked and uncertain at first, rusty from months of disuse. "Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing…" She sang it not as a performance, but as a conversation, a confession. She sang of the passage they had both been through, of the terrifying journey across a dark sea, of the desperate hope for a new shore. She sang of the ghost of the girl on the BGT stage and the electrician covered in plaster dust. She sang for the sister who had been broken and was slowly, painstakingly, putting herself back together. When the final, sorrowful chord faded into the quiet of the garden, there was only the sound of their shared breathing. Chloe’s face was awash with silent tears, but through them, she was smiling. It was a smile of fierce, complicated, unwavering pride. She gave a single, slow, deliberate nod. It was all the answer Isla needed. That night, she opened her laptop, her hands steady. She found the email from Alistair Macleod. Her reply was only three words long. *'I would love to.'*The reply from Alistair Macleod was waiting in her inbox the next morning. It was as spare and functional as a well-made tool. *‘Excellent. Our engineer is free next Tuesday. Ten a.m. is good for you? I’ll have the kettle on.’* It was followed by an address in an industrial corner of Glasgow she’d never heard of. There was no gushing, no talk of her ‘journey’, no exclamation marks. It was a plan of work, a language Isla understood perfectly. The week leading up to the recording was a strange tightrope walk over a chasm of anxiety. On the one hand, her days were filled with the grounding reality of her job; she and Kirsty were knee-deep in the George Street café project, a labyrinth of exposed brickwork and finicky vintage light fittings. On the other, the impending trip to Glasgow hummed beneath the surface of everything, a low-voltage current of pure, unadulterated terror. She found herself watching Chloe with an almost painful intensity, searching for any sign of a setback, any flicker of distress that would give her a legitimate reason to cancel. But Chloe, as if sensing this, was resolutely, stubbornly, getting better. She argued with her physiotherapist, she painstakingly made lists for the weekly shop, she even managed a short, expletive-laden phone call to her mobile provider. She was rebuilding her world, one frustrating, hard-won brick at a time, and she didn't need Isla to stand guard anymore.

The drive to Glasgow on Tuesday morning was thick with a silence that felt heavier than the persistent grey drizzle spattering the windscreen. Kirsty, sensing Isla’s state, didn’t chatter. She just drove, the van’s heater blasting, the wipers beating a steady, hypnotic rhythm. As they merged onto the M8, Isla’s hands clenched in her lap. The last time a journey had been made along this road, it had ended in catastrophe. The motorway felt like a scar on the landscape, a place of ghosts. She stared out at the blur of passing lorries and commuter cars, her stomach a cold, hard knot. “I feel like a fraud,” she said eventually, the words a stark admission in the warmth of the cab. “Like I’m playing dress-up. I’m the woman who fixes your flickering loo, not the one who makes records.” Kirsty glanced over, her expression steady. “They’re not mutually exclusive. You’re both. You’ve always been both. The only person who ever seems to have a problem with that is you.” She took the slip road into the city, her knuckles white on the steering wheel. “And for the record, you’re not a fraud. A fraud is someone pretending to be something they’re not. This is the most real you’ve been in years. So stop your whinging and try not to be sick on the new floor mats.”

The studio was not what she expected. Located in a repurposed Victorian mill building in a forgotten pocket of the city, its grimy sandstone exterior gave no hint of the sanctuary within. There was no sleek receptionist, no glass walls, just a battered red door with a small, tarnished brass plate that read 'Lismore'. Kirsty gave her shoulder a final, firm squeeze. "I'll go find a greasy spoon that does a decent roll and sausage. Call me when you're done. And Isla?" She waited until Isla met her eye. "Just sing the song." Then she was gone, leaving Isla alone on the pavement, her guitar case feeling as heavy as a coffin in her hand. Taking a breath that did little to calm the frantic drumming in her chest, she pushed open the door. The air inside was warm and smelled of old wood, hot electronics, and brewing coffee. The room was a comfortable, lived-in chaos of worn Persian rugs, overflowing bookshelves, and vintage amplifiers with glowing valves. It felt less like a high-tech recording studio and more like the den of a reclusive, music-obsessed professor. A man rose from a battered armchair behind a vast, intimidating mixing desk. He was older than Isla had pictured, perhaps in his late sixties, with a craggy, lived-in face, a thick Arran jumper, and kind, intelligent eyes that seemed to take in everything at a glance. "Isla," he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. "Alistair Macleod. You found us, then." He came forward and shook her hand. His own was rough and calloused, like her dad’s. "Coffee?"

He led her not to a glitzy green room, but to a small, cluttered kitchen where he poured two mugs of strong, black coffee. He didn’t mention Britain’s Got Talent, didn't ask about her 'story' or her 'brand'. He asked about the guitar, a luthier he recognised from the headstock. He talked about the song, its origins, the different versions he had heard over the years. He spoke to her as a fellow musician, an equal. By the time he led her into the main recording space, a large, wood-panelled room with a single microphone standing sentinel in the centre, the icy knot in Isla's stomach had begun to melt. "We'll do a couple of takes with the guitar," Alistair’s voice came through the headphones he’d handed her. "Find the level. Then we’ll try it the way the engineer told me about. Just the voice." Isla nodded, her throat suddenly dry. She sat on the offered stool, positioned her guitar, and took a deep breath. The silence in the headphones was absolute. She could hear her own heartbeat, loud and unsteady. She began to play, her fingers stiff and clumsy on the frets. She sang, her voice tight and controlled, carefully placing each note, focusing on her pitch, her diction. It was technically perfect. It was also completely lifeless, a soulless echo of the real thing. When she finished, the silence stretched. "Okay," Alistair’s voice said, calm and neutral. "That’s a lovely, clean take. Let's try another one."

They did three more takes with the guitar, each one as technically proficient and emotionally empty as the last. Isla was performing. She was the girl on the stage again, trying to impress the judges. The frustration mounted with each attempt, a hot, choking feeling in her chest. Finally, Alistair’s voice came through the cans again, gentle but firm. "Right, hen. Put the guitar down." Isla obeyed, resting the familiar wood against the stool. "I want you to close your eyes," he continued. "Forget the microphone. Forget you're in a studio in Glasgow. I want you to tell me something. When you sing this song, the real way… who are you singing it for?" The question cut through all her layers of performance anxiety and self-consciousness. It was simple, direct, and devastating. Who was she singing for? Her mind flashed with a series of images: Kirsty’s fiercely loyal face, her dad's quiet, painful pride, and then, with overwhelming clarity, Chloe. Chloe, lying still and silent in a forest of wires and tubes. Chloe, her face crumpling in frustration as she failed to find a word. Chloe, smiling through her tears in the garden, nodding her sister on.

"Okay," Isla whispered into the microphone, her voice barely audible. "I'm ready." She didn't open her eyes. She wasn't in the studio anymore. She was in the echoing silence of the hospital chapel, the scent of antiseptic in the air. She took a breath, not a singer's calibrated intake of air, but a ragged, emotional gasp. And then she sang. The voice that came out of her was not the trained, careful instrument from the first few takes. It was a raw, visceral thing, dredged up from the deepest well of her fear and her love. It was the sound of the last six months, of watching her sister fight her way back from the brink, of her own heart breaking and slowly, painstakingly, being mended. The melody was a conduit for a story of passage that was no longer about a prince in a boat, but about a soul making the perilous journey back to the land of the living. She poured every sleepless night, every small victory, every ounce of her fierce, protective love for her stubborn, brilliant, broken sister into the song. It was not a performance. It was a testimony.

When the last note faded, she kept her eyes closed, unable to move. The silence that followed was different. It wasn't empty; it was heavy, profound, ringing with the ghost of the song. She stood there for what felt like an eternity, her own ragged breathing the only sound in her ears. She waited for the verdict, for the polite dismissal, for the judgment. Finally, the silence in her headphones was broken by a soft crackle, and then Alistair’s voice, thick with an emotion he wasn't trying to hide. "Aye, lass," he said, his voice a low, rough murmur. "That’s the one."

The journey home was the mirror image of the drive there. The van was filled with a quiet, peaceful exhaustion. Isla leaned her head against the cool glass of the passenger window, watching the streetlights of the M8 blur into golden streaks. She felt scoured out, hollowed, but in a clean, essential way. She had left everything she had in that wood-panelled room, and in doing so, had found a part of herself she thought was gone forever. "So," Kirsty said softly, as they crossed the Forth Road Bridge, the lights of Edinburgh glittering ahead of them like a fallen constellation. "Was it okay?" Isla turned her head, a slow, weary smile spreading across her face. "Aye," she said, her voice still raw. "It was okay." It was the most profound understatement of her life. When she let herself into her parents' house an hour later, the downstairs was quiet. A note on the kitchen table in her mum’s handwriting read, 'Chloe's tired, gone to bed.' Isla climbed the stairs, her boots heavy on the carpet. The door to Chloe’s room was slightly ajar. Peeking in, she saw her sister asleep, the gentle rise and fall of her breathing even and deep. On the bedside table, next to the usual clutter of books and water glasses, was a single, fresh post-it note. On it, in Chloe’s spiky, determined handwriting, was one word. 'Onward.'The winter had been long and grey, a fitting backdrop for the slow, grinding work of recovery. But now, spring was staging a quiet coup in Edinburgh. Tentative sunshine warmed the flagstones, and the breeze blowing in from the Forth carried the scent of damp earth and distant salt instead of biting frost. The new season had brought a new, fragile equilibrium. The house in Corstorphine was no longer a convalescent home; it was just home again, albeit one with more strategically placed grab bars and a colour-coded rota for Chloe’s appointments stuck to the fridge. The most significant change, however, had taken place at the dining table. It had been commandeered by Chloe, transformed into a makeshift command centre. Her old, high-powered laptop had been replaced with a tablet that had accessibility features, and her battleground was no longer a corporate marketing plan, but the chaotic, analogue mess of Sparks Electrical’s bookkeeping.

Isla watched from the doorway one evening, a mug of tea warming her hands, as Chloe, her brow furrowed in concentration, laboriously tapped at a spreadsheet she had designed. Her left hand, her non-dominant one, moved slowly but with increasing accuracy. She was cross-referencing a pile of scrawled invoices with their bank statements, a task Isla and Kirsty had been meaning to do for about three years. A low noise of frustration escaped her as she tried to zoom in on a particular cell. “This… tablet… is a… child’s toy,” she muttered, the words costing her visible effort. It had been her idea, a few weeks after Isla’s recording session. She had declared, with the shaky authority of a deposed monarch, that their business finances were a “bloody disgrace” and that she was the only one with a brain “organised… enough… to fix it.” Kirsty had been overjoyed. Isla had been terrified. But Chloe, fuelled by a potent combination of stubbornness and tea, had proven them all wrong. She had found a way to work. It wasn't the high-flying career she had once envisioned, but it was hers. She was no longer a plant being watered; she was the new, slightly terrifyingly efficient, accounts department.

The album, ‘Echoes of the North’, arrived on a Tuesday, unceremoniously, in a padded brown envelope addressed to Isla. It felt strangely anticlimactic. She had spent months trying not to think about it, pushing the memory of that day in the studio to the back of her mind. Seeing the finished product, its stark, monochrome cover art depicting a lone standing stone against a stormy sky, made her heart hammer against her ribs. She didn’t open it. She just left it on the hall table, as if it were a bomb she didn’t know how to defuse. Kirsty found it there that evening when she came over, bringing fish and chips that filled the house with the glorious, greasy scent of salt and vinegar. She picked up the CD case, examining the track list on the back. "Track four," she read aloud, a note of profound satisfaction in her voice. "'The Skye Boat Song'. Artist: Isla Sparkes." She looked at Isla, her expression unreadable. "Aren't you going to listen to it?" "We should eat first," Isla said, her voice tight. "Before it gets cold."

It was Chloe who forced the issue. After they had eaten, and while Kirsty and Isla were arguing over who had left the last empty milk carton in the work van’s glove compartment, Chloe wheeled herself over to the old stereo system in the corner of the living room. It was a relic from the nineties that mostly gathered dust, but it had a CD player. With painstaking slowness, she took the CD from its case, her fingers fumbling with the plastic. Isla started to get up to help, but a sharp look from Kirsty stopped her. Chloe finally managed to slide the disc into the tray and, after a moment of hunting, pressed the play button. The first track began, a haunting fiddle piece. They listened in silence as the first few songs played, a beautiful, curated collection of modern Scottish folk. Then, the opening notes of a sparse, melancholic piano introduced track four. And then came her voice. Isla flinched as if she had touched a live wire. Hearing it, disembodied and pure, filling the quiet living room, was a profoundly strange and unsettling experience. It was her, but it wasn't. The voice was stripped of all doubt and anxiety; all that remained was the raw, aching heart of the song. It held the sterile quiet of the ICU, the desperate hope of the hospital chapel, the fierce, unconditional love that had carried them all through the darkness. It was the truest thing she had ever done.

She couldn’t look at anyone. She just stared at her own hands, at the callouses on her fingertips and the faint traces of plaster dust under her nails. The three minutes and forty-two seconds of the song felt like a lifetime. When the final, fading note was swallowed by silence, no one spoke. Kirsty cleared her throat, her own eyes suspiciously bright. Isla finally dared to look at Chloe. Her sister wasn't looking at her. She was staring out of the window into the dark garden, her face illuminated by the dim light from the stereo. A single tear tracked its way down her cheek, but she wasn't sad. Her expression was one of quiet, absolute peace. She had heard it too. She had understood everything Isla couldn't say. Without turning, she reached out her hand towards Isla. Isla took it, her own fingers closing around her sister's. The connection was warm, solid, and real.

The ripples started a week later. A small, glowing review in a national newspaper’s arts section called the album 'a vital collection' and singled out Isla's track as 'a breathtaking, gut-punch of a performance… a voice that sounds like it’s been dredged from the very soul of the land.' Then, one evening, while Kirsty was driving them home from a job, a familiar voice came on the radio. It was the host of the BBC Scotland folk show, his gentle Hebridean burr introducing the next song. "And here's a voice some of you might recognise from a very different context," he said. "But believe me, this is where she belongs. From the new album 'Echoes of the North', this is Isla Sparkes." And then the song played, her voice filling the small, enclosed space of the van. Isla and Kirsty just looked at each other, stunned into silence. Hearing it by accident, out in the world, broadcast over the airwaves, felt more real than holding the CD in her hand. "Bloody hell, Sparky," Kirsty breathed, a slow, wide grin spreading across her face. "You're on the actual radio."

The call from Alistair Macleod came the following Friday. Isla was up a ladder in a dusty loft, wrestling with a new immersion heater, when her phone buzzed. She saw his name and her stomach did a nervous flip. She nearly ignored it, but a sharp prod from Kirsty on the ground below forced her to answer, tucking the phone between her ear and shoulder. "Isla," Alistair’s gravelly voice said, without preamble. "The song is going down well." "Oh. Right. Good," she managed, her own voice a croak. "The reason I'm calling," he continued, "is that we've had some interest. A few gig offers. Small stuff. Folk clubs. But there's one… Celtic Connections are putting on a 'New Voices' showcase at the Old Fruitmarket in January. They want you for a twenty-minute set." The Old Fruitmarket. Celtic Connections. It was the most prestigious folk festival in the country. It wasn't a soulless arena or a TV studio. It was a hallowed hall, a place for real musicians. It was another world. "I… I don't do gigs," Isla said automatically, the words a reflex defence. "I'm an electrician." There was a pause on the other end. Isla could hear the faint sound of a kettle whistling in the background. "I know what you are, Isla," Alistair said, his voice patient but firm. "I also know what I heard in my studio. The offer is there. You don't have to decide now. But a voice like yours isn't meant to stay in a dusty loft. Think about it." He hung up, leaving Isla perched on her ladder, surrounded by insulation and cobwebs, the scent of old dust and ozone thick in her throat. The world she had so carefully rebuilt, the simple, predictable circuit of her life, had just been presented with a terrifying, brilliant, undeniable surge of power.The phone felt unnervingly heavy in Isla’s hand. From her perch, the loft was a familiar territory of shadows and stored histories, but the comfortable silence had been shattered. Alistair Macleod’s words seemed to hang in the dusty air, shimmering with a terrifying potential. Below, Kirsty had her hands on her hips, her head tilted back, her expression a perfect blend of impatience and intense curiosity. She looked like a general waiting for a field report from a scout who had just seen something unbelievable.

“Well?” Kirsty’s voice cut through the haze in Isla’s mind. “Did he offer you a job insulating his attic? You’ve gone the colour of unset plaster.”

Isla descended the ladder slowly, her movements stiff and automatic. Her mind was a frantic switching station of crossed signals and shorting circuits. Celtic Connections. The Old Fruitmarket. These were not just names; they were sacred ground, institutions of the music she revered. To be invited there was not a media stunt; it was an acknowledgment. It was terrifying. “It’s nothing,” she said, her voice sounding distant to her own ears as she reached the bottom step. “Just an offer for a gig. A small thing.”

“A small thing,” Kirsty repeated, her tone flat and devoid of belief. She held out her hand for the phone. “Let me guess. The Dog and Duck open mic night?” Isla didn’t move, so Kirsty simply plucked the phone from her numb fingers and hit the redial button, putting it on speaker before Isla could protest. It rang twice before Alistair’s gravelly voice answered. “Macleod.”

“Hi, Alistair, it’s Kirsty, Isla’s partner,” Kirsty said, her voice all business. “She’s just had a bit of a funny turn up a ladder. Something about a ‘small thing’. Was that the twenty-minute showcase set at the Old Fruitmarket for Celtic Connections you were offering her?”

There was a dry chuckle on the other end of the line. “Aye, that’s the one. She seems to have a habit of understating things.”

“You have no idea,” Kirsty said, shooting Isla a look that could strip paint. “Don’t worry. I’ll talk some sense into her. Thanks for the call.” She hung up, tossing the phone back to Isla. “Right. We’re finishing up here. We need to go and have a board meeting.”

The board meeting, as it turned out, took place around her parents’ dining table, over lukewarm tea and a plate of rapidly softening digestives. Kirsty, having laid out the situation with the subtlety of a dropped tool bag, sat back with her arms crossed, a prosecuting attorney who had just presented an unshakeable case. Ewan looked quietly terrified, as if his daughter had just been called up for a mission to Mars. Sharon was already mentally planning an outfit that wouldn’t clash with the stage lighting. And Chloe, sitting at the head of the table in her wheelchair, was silent. She just watched Isla, her expression completely unreadable, her gaze missing nothing.

“It’s not possible,” Isla said, addressing the table at large but looking only at her sister. “The business is too busy. And Chloe, you need… I need to be here.” She used Chloe as a shield, a justification so pure and good that she hoped it would be impenetrable. “My job is here.”

The silence that followed was broken by a slow, rhythmic tapping. It was Chloe, her left index finger hitting the surface of her tablet. She wasn’t looking at a screen; she was just tapping out a beat of pure, unadulterated rage. Finally, she looked up, her eyes blazing with a fire that Isla hadn’t seen since before the accident. She stabbed a finger first at her own chest, then at Isla.

“You,” she said, the single word sharp and clear. Then she took a breath, fighting for the next words. “You… hide. Behind… me.” She shook her head, a gesture of profound disgust. “I am… not… your excuse.” She turned her head and pointed towards the living room, where Isla’s guitar case leaned against the wall like a silent accusation. “That… is… your job. The other… is… wiring.”

“Chloe, it’s not that simple,” Isla pleaded, her defences crumbling under her sister’s direct assault. “That was a fluke. A one-off song I sang when I was half out of my mind with grief. This is a proper festival. These are real musicians. I’ll get up there and they’ll all see me for what I am. A fraud. A sparky who got lucky once.”

“Good,” Chloe snapped back, the word shockingly quick. The force of her own fluency seemed to surprise even her. She took another breath, slower this time. “Let them. See you. Let them… see… a woman… who works. And… sings. Who is… afraid. And… does it anyway.” She leaned forward, her hands gripping the arms of her wheelchair, her whole body invested in the effort of communication. “I… fight. Every day. To find… a word. To make… tea. To walk. It is… hard. And I do it.” Her gaze locked with Isla’s, and it was filled not with accusation, but with a fierce, desperate love. “Do not… you… dare… be a coward. For me.”

The words landed in the quiet room with the force of a physical impact. The simple, brutal truth of it silenced everyone. Chloe was in a daily, relentless battle, and here Isla was, scared of a twenty-minute set in a warm, dry room full of people who wanted to hear her sing. The selfishness of her own fear was laid bare, and she felt a hot flush of shame. She had thought she was protecting Chloe, but she had only been protecting herself, using Chloe’s fragility as a barricade against her own terror.

Kirsty, ever the pragmatist, broke the spell. “So that’s settled then,” she said, picking up a digestive biscuit and examining it with interest. “The gig is in January. That gives us two months. I’ll juggle the schedule. You’ll practice. And I’ll be on the sound desk, making sure no one messes with your levels.” She took a bite of the biscuit. “And I’m driving. The van’s got more room for merch, just in case.”

Later that night, long after Kirsty had gone home and her parents had gone to bed, Isla sat on the floor of her old bedroom. The house was quiet, filled with the gentle, rhythmic sounds of sleep. She pulled her guitar from its case. It felt different in her hands tonight, not just a comfort, but a challenge. An obligation. She thought about a twenty-minute set. 'The Skye Boat Song' was four minutes long. She needed more. Her fingers found the strings, and she began to play, not the familiar chords of her one famous song, but the forgotten shapes of others. An old Dougie MacLean ballad her dad loved. A fiery, finger-picked instrumental she hadn’t attempted in years. A half-finished melody of her own she had abandoned long ago. The music was rusty, her fingers clumsy, her voice hesitant. But as she played, something shifted. The fear didn’t vanish, but it changed shape, transmuting from a paralysing dread into a thrumming, high-voltage current of nervous energy. She wasn’t a fraud playing dress-up. She was a musician with a gig to prepare for. She had a job to do.The two months leading up to January were a strange and intense apprenticeship. The house in Corstorphine, once a quiet harbour for healing, transformed into a multi-purpose headquarters for a fledgling musical career and a recovering accounts department. Music was no longer a guilty secret indulged in late at night, but a legitimate, timetabled activity. The living room became a rehearsal space, the quiet hum of the fridge often punctuated by the sound of a repeated chord progression or a frustrated sigh as Isla wrestled with a tricky lyric. Chloe was the unflinching director of this new operation. Enthroned in her wheelchair with her tablet and a formidable glare, she was a terrifyingly effective producer. Her linguistic limitations had sharpened her critical faculties to a razor’s edge. She could halt a song mid-verse with a single, sharply raised hand. Her feedback was brutal, delivered in staccato pronouncements that were impossible to argue with. “Boring,” she’d declare after Isla finished a perfectly pleasant but uninspired rendition of a ballad. “No… heart.” If a guitar instrumental was too fast, she’d simply say, “Show-off. Lost… the story.” She would listen to Isla practice a song for an hour, her expression unreadable, then point to one specific line in the lyrics. “That. That one. Again. Louder.”

Isla found it both infuriating and indispensable. Chloe was immune to her sister’s anxieties and excuses. She didn’t care that Isla was tired after a ten-hour day on a building site; she only cared if the song was right. She was forcing Isla to excavate her own music, to dig past the pleasantries and find the raw, emotional core of each piece. Under this relentless scrutiny, Isla’s set began to take shape. It was a patchwork quilt of her life: there was ‘The Skye Boat Song’, of course, the anchor of it all. There was a stark, minor-key arrangement of ‘The Twa Corbies’, a dark traditional ballad that she imbued with a modern, chilling resonance. She unearthed a fast, intricate instrumental she’d written years ago, a furious, fret-board-spanning piece that Chloe had dismissed as “show-off” until Isla, in a fit of pique, had played it slower, angrier, letting the melody breathe and revealing the deep melancholy at its heart. “Better,” Chloe had conceded, with a small, grudging nod.

While the music took shape at home, the business of Sparks Electrical continued unabated, a grounding counterpoint to the creative chaos. Kirsty, true to her word, became a master scheduler, a logistical wizard who somehow managed to fit a full week’s work into four days, clearing time for Isla to practice. The van became a mobile think tank. As Kirsty drove between jobs, Isla would stare out at the passing Edinburgh streets, humming melodies, tapping out rhythms on the dashboard. One afternoon, while wiring a series of spotlights in a high-end kitchen, she found herself absent-mindedly humming a tune she’d been wrestling with the night before. The homeowner, a woman in her fifties, paused from admiring her new granite countertops. “That’s a lovely tune,” she said. “Is it an old one?” Isla, startled, just shook her head. “No. Just something I’m working on.” The casual exchange was a small revelation. Her music could exist out here, in the real world, woven into the fabric of her working day. It didn’t have to be one thing or the other. She was the woman who could fix your lights, and she was the woman who wrote the tune.

With three weeks to go, Kirsty made an announcement. "Right," she said, slapping a flyer down on the coffee table. It was for a Tuesday 'New Music' night at The Piper's Rest, their old haunt. "You've got a warm-up gig." Isla felt the blood drain from her face. "No. Absolutely not. The deal was Celtic Connections. Not a sticky-floored pub full of people I know." Kirsty was unmoved. "You haven't played in front of a live audience that wasn't either comatose or related to you in over a year. You need to remember what it feels like. You need to test the material. It’s a controlled demolition. Better to have a wall fall down in here than at the Fruitmarket." Chloe, from her seat, simply pointed at the flyer and then at Isla. "Go." The verdict was in. The controlled demolition was scheduled.

The Piper’s Rest smelled exactly the same: spilt beer, hopeful desperation, and the faint, lingering aroma of stale crisps. But tonight, it felt different. It was no longer a comforting escape; it was an arena. The crowd was bigger than a usual Tuesday, a mix of regulars who looked confused by the small temporary stage and a smattering of curious strangers who had clearly seen the flyer. Her dad and Sharon were there, huddled in a corner booth, Ewan looking as though he was about to watch his daughter wrestle a bear. And at a table right at the front sat Chloe and Kirsty. Chloe looked impossibly regal in her wheelchair, her expression stern and focused. Kirsty just gave Isla a thumbs-up and mouthed the words, ‘Don’t be shite.’ Isla climbed onto the small stage, her boots unsteady on the worn plywood. The single spotlight felt hotter and brighter than any floodlight on the BGT stage. She could see every face, every whispered conversation. Her hands were sweating, her throat was tight. This was infinitely more terrifying than singing for an invisible audience of millions. These were real people, three feet away. This was real. She opened with ‘The Twa Corbies’, her fingers fumbling the introduction, her voice thin and shaky. Someone at the bar laughed loudly at a joke. A phone screen flared in the gloom. The song limped to a close, met with a smattering of polite, confused applause. Panic, cold and sharp, seized her. She was a fraud. She couldn’t do this. Her eyes found Chloe’s in the crowd. Her sister wasn’t looking at her with pity. Her expression was hard, demanding. It said, *Fight*.

Isla took a breath. She closed her eyes, shutting out the bar noise and the indifferent faces. She forgot the setlist. She thought of the studio, of Alistair Macleod’s voice in her headphones. *Who are you singing it for?* She started to play the instrumental, the one Chloe had forced her to rework. She played it not as a performance, but as a statement, a release of all the pent-up frustration and fear of the last year. The notes were angry and sad and defiant. The intricate melody filled the room, cutting through the chatter. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the noise began to die down. The laughter at the bar faded. The phone screens were lowered. By the time she played the final, lingering chord, the pub was silent. She didn’t wait for applause. She flowed straight into the opening bars of 'The Skye Boat Song', her voice, when it came, sure and strong, filled with the hard-won clarity of experience. She wasn’t performing it anymore. She was living it. She sang it for them, for her family, for the curious strangers and the confused regulars. She sang it for the woman who had spent months by a hospital bed, and for the sister who had fought her way back. And the pub, in all its sticky, imperfect glory, listened. When she finished, the silence held for a heartbeat, and then the room erupted. It wasn’t the polite applause from before. It was a roar, a genuine, heartfelt wave of sound that seemed to shake the very foundations of the old building. Isla opened her eyes and saw her dad on his feet, clapping so hard his face was bright red. She saw strangers smiling, nodding. And she saw Kirsty, a wide, triumphant grin on her face, raising her pint glass in a salute. Then she looked at Chloe. Her sister was not clapping. She was just watching Isla, and on her face was a look of such fierce, absolute, uncomplicated love that it took Isla’s breath away. In that moment, the fear was gone, burned away by the heat of the music and the raw, undeniable connection with the people in the room. She wasn't a sparky or a singer. She was just Isla, and she had a story to tell. She was ready.The journey home from The Piper’s Rest was a study in quiet triumph. The van, which had been thick with a tense, unspoken anxiety on the way there, was now a warm, rumbling bubble of relief. In the back, Sharon was giving a breathless, note-by-note commentary of the set to a quietly beaming Ewan, her voice a happy murmur. In the front, Kirsty drove with a relaxed, satisfied smile, one hand resting on the gear stick, occasionally glancing over at Isla with an expression that said, *I told you so*. Isla herself was quiet, her head resting against the cool glass of the passenger window, watching the familiar Edinburgh streets slide by. The city lights seemed brighter, the night air cleaner. The barrier she had built around herself, the thick, insulating wall of fear and self-doubt, had been breached. It hadn’t been a catastrophic failure, but a controlled demolition, just as Kirsty had predicted, leaving a clear, open space where something new could be built.

As they pulled up outside the house in Corstorphine, Chloe, who had been profoundly silent for the entire journey, reached out from the back seat and laid her hand on Isla’s arm. Her grip was surprisingly strong. Isla turned to look at her sister. In the dim glow of the streetlights, Chloe’s face was serene, the earlier intensity replaced by a deep, settled calm. She held Isla’s gaze for a long moment, then her lips formed a single, carefully chosen word. “More.” It wasn’t a question or a command. It was a statement of fact, a prophecy. Then she released Isla’s arm, her point made, and waited for Kirsty to help her with the wheelchair ramp. The single word resonated in Isla’s mind long after the house was quiet, long after she had lain down to sleep. It was the only review that mattered.

January arrived on a wave of biting wind and iron-grey skies. The day of the Celtic Connections gig felt both momentous and utterly ordinary. The morning was spent on a job in a draughty Victorian flat, replacing a series of ancient, crumbling dimmer switches while the owner complained about the price of artisan sourdough. It was the perfect antidote to pre-show jitters. There was no time to be terrified of a twenty-minute set when you were trying to feed new wiring through a wall cavity that seemed to be filled exclusively with hundred-year-old dust and the ghosts of mice past. The real shift happened when they finally pulled up outside the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow. The building was magnificent, a grand cathedral of commerce built from red sandstone and wrought iron, its history palpable even from the street. It was a world away from the soulless, corporate hangar of the BGT arena or the beloved, sticky-floored confines of The Piper’s Rest. This was a place built for voices, for music, for stories. It was intimidating, but it felt right.

Backstage was a low-key, professional hum. There were no frantic runners with clipboards, no camera crews, no forced bonhomie. It was a warren of corridors and dressing rooms filled with musicians tuning fiddles, warming up their voices with quiet scales, or simply sitting and reading, conserving their energy. Isla saw a legendary accordion player she had admired for years walk past with a nod and a quiet, “Alright, hen?” It was a community of artisans, and for the first time, Isla felt a terrifying, thrilling flicker of belonging. Kirsty, in her element, immediately began inspecting the stage wiring and engaging the head sound engineer in a highly technical and borderline aggressive conversation about microphone placement. Chloe, a warm tartan blanket across her knees, was a silent, immovable anchor in the corner of their shared dressing room, her presence a powerful, unspoken source of pressure and support. She was not a nervous relative; she was the director, the producer, and she was expecting a flawless performance.

When the stage manager, a cheerful woman with a shock of purple hair, poked her head around the door and said, “Isla? Five minutes,” a jolt of pure adrenaline shot through Isla’s system. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, wild rhythm. Kirsty gave her a bone-crushing, one-armed hug. “You know the drill. Don’t be shite,” she whispered, before heading out to her spot by the sound desk. Isla knelt in front of Chloe. Her sister reached out and smoothed a stray piece of Isla’s hair back from her face, her touch gentle. She didn’t offer any last-minute advice. She just looked Isla in the eye, her own gaze clear and fiercely proud. It was all she needed. Taking a deep breath, Isla picked up her guitar and walked towards the wings, the scent of old wood, floor polish, and anticipation thick in the air.

She stepped from the shadowy wings into the warm, golden blaze of the stage lights. The hall was beautiful. A vast, vaulted space held up by ornate cast-iron pillars, packed to the rafters with a sea of expectant, attentive faces. The silence that greeted her was not an absence of noise, but a presence, a collective, held breath. This was a listening audience. She walked to the single microphone at the centre of the stage, sat on the simple wooden stool, and took a moment, letting the profound silence of the hall settle in her bones. She didn't feel like a fraud. She felt like an electrician who had been called to do a very specific, very important job. Her fingers found the strings, and she began to play the instrumental piece, the one Chloe had forced her to deconstruct and rebuild. The notes, fast and intricate but laced with a deep, brooding melancholy, spun out into the vast space, weaving through the iron pillars and rising to the vaulted roof. She wasn't just playing; she was telling the story of the last year with her hands, a tale of fury and fight and fragile hope. The audience leaned in as one, captured.

When the last note faded, she allowed herself a small smile. “Good evening,” she said, her voice steadier than she expected. “My name’s Isla. I’m an electrician from Leith.” A warm, gentle laugh rippled through the crowd, a wave of acceptance that washed over her, calming the last of her nerves. “This is a song about two crows.” She launched into ‘The Twa Corbies’, her voice now strong and sure, filling the hall with the chilling, ancient tale. She followed it with her own unnamed song, the one about fixing things, and felt a jolt of pure joy as the audience, who had never heard it before, responded to its simple, heartfelt melody. Then, she took a breath. "This last song… this song means a great deal to me. It’s about a long journey home.”

She began to play the opening chords of ‘The Skye Boat Song’. She sang it differently than she ever had before. It was no longer just her story, her private prayer for her sister. In this hall, surrounded by hundreds of silent, listening souls, it became something bigger, a universal anthem for every journey through darkness, for every passage from a broken shore to a place of healing. The raw emotion that had been captured in the studio was magnified a hundredfold in the live performance, her voice soaring with a power and clarity that surprised even her. It was a release, a culmination, a final, public catharsis.

The final note hung in the air, vibrating in the profound silence of the hall. For a long, suspended moment, nothing happened. Then, a single person began to clap, and it was like a dam breaking. The applause rose, a thunderous, rolling wave of sound that washed over her, pressing in on her from all sides. The entire hall was on its feet. Through the blur of the lights, she saw the faces in the crowd, saw people wiping tears from their eyes, saw strangers turning to each other and nodding. She bowed, a flush of pure, disbelieving joy spreading through her. Walking off the stage, deafened and dazed, the first person she saw was Kirsty, her face split by a grin so wide it looked painful. She didn't say anything, just grabbed Isla and lifted her off her feet in a spinning, triumphant hug. Over Kirsty’s shoulder, Isla saw her. Chloe. She was positioned in the wings, her face illuminated by the spill of light from the stage. She was not crying. Her expression was one of absolute, unadulterated triumph. As their eyes met, she slowly, deliberately, lifted her hand and smiled, a real, wide, effortless smile, untroubled by the mechanics of speech. And as Isla stood there, her guitar still in her hand, the roar of the crowd still ringing in her ears, and her sister’s perfect, joyful smile shining before her, it felt like every wire in her life, every broken connection and frayed end, had finally been joined together, creating a circuit so bright and powerful it could light up the entire world.The dressing room backstage at the Old Fruitmarket was a small, chaotic bubble of joy. The air, thick with the scent of wilting flowers someone had delivered and the lingering adrenaline of the performance, vibrated with a happy, exhausted energy. Ewan, his face red and blotchy, couldn't seem to stop patting Isla on the back, his big stonemason’s hand landing with a gentle, repetitive thud, his vocabulary reduced to a heartfelt, “Och, hen. Just… och.” Sharon, meanwhile, was a whirlwind of second-hand excitement, already recounting the reactions of the people sitting near her to anyone who would listen, her voice giddy with pride. And in the centre of the storm, holding a can of Irn-Bru like a trophy, sat Kirsty, radiating a deep, smug satisfaction that was more potent than any verbal praise. She caught Isla’s eye and raised the can in a silent toast, a gesture that conveyed a decade’s worth of shared history and unwavering belief. It was a perfect, brilliant moment, a snapshot of pure, uncomplicated victory that Isla wanted to frame and keep forever.

The quiet knock on the door came as a surprise. Alistair Macleod stood in the doorway, his craggy face softened by a small, genuine smile. He held a bottle of what looked like very good single malt whisky and two glasses, ignoring the general hubbub and directing his attention solely to Isla. He didn't offer effusive praise or gush about the crowd’s reaction. Instead, he poured a generous measure of whisky into each glass and handed one to her. The gesture felt less like a celebration and more like a transaction between professionals, a mark of respect from one artisan to another. "That was good work," he said, his voice a low rumble. He took a sip of his own whisky, his eyes thoughtful. "That setlist. It tells a story. The story you sang in the studio has grown." He paused, looking at her over the rim of his glass. "That wasn't an ending tonight, Isla. That felt like the first chapter. You should think about what comes next." He didn't wait for a reply, just gave a small nod, set his unfinished glass down on a table, and disappeared back into the warren of corridors, leaving the bottle of whisky and the weight of his words behind.

The drive back along the M8 that night was the quietest it had ever been. It was not the tense, fearful silence of the journey there, nor the shell-shocked quiet of the trips to the hospital. It was a thoughtful, contemplative stillness, the sound of four people processing a fundamental shift in their shared reality. The lights of passing lorries illuminated the cab in rhythmic flashes, each one revealing the different expressions on their faces. Ewan’s quiet pride, Sharon’s tired happiness, Kirsty’s focused calm. Isla stared out at the dark, rolling hills of the central belt, the amber warmth of the whisky still glowing in her stomach. The ghost that had haunted this road for her, the memory of the accident, felt distant tonight, replaced by a new, more complicated spectre: the future. Alistair’s words echoed in her mind. *That felt like the first chapter.* The phrase suggested a book she had never intended to write, a story that was now demanding to be told, whether she was ready to tell it or not.

Monday morning was a harsh, physical reality check. At seven a.m., Isla was not in a recording studio or a rehearsal room; she was on her hands and knees in a freezing cold church hall in Penicuik, feeding armoured cable under a raised floor, the scent of dust and damp stone thick in her nostrils. The glamour of the Old Fruitmarket felt like a fever dream. Her hands, which had coaxed such delicate, powerful music from her guitar, were now grimed with dirt, her muscles aching from the awkward, repetitive work. It was grounding. It was real. It was, in a strange way, a relief. Around mid-morning, as she was stripping a wire, the plasterer working in the adjoining room, a burly man named Dave with a portable radio permanently glued to his ear, poked his head through the doorway. "Hey, you're that singer lass, aren't you?" he asked, his face curious. "Heard you on the radio the other day. That sad boat song. It's good, that. Proper music." He gave a nod of approval, then disappeared again, leaving Isla staring at the half-wired socket in her hand, the two halves of her life colliding in the dusty air of a cold church hall.

The email from Alistair arrived that evening, as succinct and professional as all his communications. The subject line was simply: ‘The Next Chapter’. The body of the email was brief. He wrote that Lismore Records was formally offering her a record deal for a full-length album. He outlined a proposed schedule: three months, starting in the spring, to write and arrange the material, followed by a concentrated period of recording at the Glasgow studio. There was a modest but respectable advance mentioned, enough to live on for the duration. It was a real, concrete offer. Not a fantasy, not a prize in a competition, but a contract for a job of work. It was an invitation to take the biggest risk of her life, to step off the solid ground of her trade and into the unpredictable, terrifying world of her art. Isla read the email, then closed the laptop and sat in the quiet of her living room, the weight of the decision settling on her like a physical object. This wasn't just about a one-off performance anymore. This was about choosing a path.

The second board meeting was convened the next evening. This time, the atmosphere was different. There were no tears or emotional speeches. This was a logistical problem to be solved. Kirsty came armed with the business accounts, a calculator, and a fiercely practical expression. Chloe, from her command post at the dining table, had already created a new spreadsheet on her tablet, titled 'ALBUM PROJECT - FINANCIAL/LOGISTICAL ANALYSIS'. "Right," Kirsty began, slapping the accounts book on the table. "Financially, the advance covers your wages for the duration. Just. But the business can't sustain a three-month hiatus from one half of its workforce. We're booked solid until summer. I can't do it all." The problem hung in the air, a solid, insurmountable wall. Isla felt a familiar, sinking feeling. It was impossible. She would have to say no. "Hire someone," Chloe said, her voice quiet but clear. They all turned to look at her. She tapped her tablet. "I have… run numbers. We can afford… a temp. A junior. For three… months. To be your… labourer." She looked at Kirsty. "You teach. They lift." Then she looked at Isla. "You… write." It was a breathtakingly simple, elegant solution. She hadn't seen a problem; she'd seen a variable and had already solved the equation.

That night, Isla couldn't sleep. She sat by her window, her guitar across her lap, looking out at the lights of Leith twinkling in the darkness. She thought of the fear she had felt on the stage, and the joy that had replaced it. She thought of the plasterer in the church hall, and the simple, unaffected rightness of his comment. She thought of Chloe's spreadsheet, a document that was both a financial analysis and the most profound expression of love and belief she had ever received. She was an electrician. She fixed things, she made connections, she brought light to dark spaces. And she was a singer, a songwriter. She did the same thing, just with melodies and words instead of copper and wire. They weren't two separate people. They were two sides of the same circuit. Kirsty had been right all along. Picking up her guitar, her fingers found a new, unfamiliar chord shape. A melody, hesitant at first, then clearer, began to emerge in the quiet of the room. It was the start of a new song, the first of many. It was her answer. She was ready to write the next chapter.The reality of becoming a full-time songwriter was far less romantic than the phrase suggested. It did not involve sitting in poetic contemplation by a window, waiting for the muse to strike. It involved an awkward handover in a drizzly B&Q car park with a nervous, spotty nineteen-year-old named Liam, who was to be Isla’s three-month replacement. He had a brand-new, un-creased tool belt and the wide, terrified eyes of a fawn cornered by a cement mixer. Isla spent an hour walking him through the van’s chaotic filing system (a plastic crate full of loose receipts) and its various mechanical idiosyncrasies (the temperamental side door that only opened if you kicked it in a specific spot). Handing over the keys felt like a small, sharp betrayal. “He seems… keen,” Isla said to Kirsty, watching as Liam tried, and failed, to work out the van’s handbrake. “He’s going to electrocute himself before lunchtime,” Kirsty replied grimly, but without any real heat. “Don’t worry about it. Your job is to go and have feelings to a chord progression. Now get out of here before I put you to work.”

The first two weeks were a special kind of hell. The sudden, unstructured freedom was paralysing. The silence of her flat, which had once been a cherished sanctuary, now felt vast and accusatory. She would sit for hours with her guitar, a blank notebook open on the floor, her mind a roaring, empty void. Every melody she stumbled upon sounded like a cheap imitation of something else. Every lyric she wrote felt like a line from a bad greeting card. She tried to write about big themes – love, loss, hope – but the words were hollow, second-hand. Chloe, in her role as executive producer, was merciless. Isla would play her something she’d slaved over for a day, a carefully constructed ballad with a thoughtful melody, and Chloe would listen with a stony expression before delivering a devastating, two-word verdict: “Sounds… nice.” In Chloe’s new vocabulary, ‘nice’ was the most brutal of insults. It meant safe, boring, and utterly devoid of truth. After one particularly galling session, where a song about a sunset was dismissed as sounding like a “holiday… advert,” Isla broke. She called Kirsty in a panic, her voice tight with unshed tears. “I can’t do this. I’ve got nothing. It’s all gone. I’m a one-song wonder. Let me come back. Liam can do the paperwork. I need to fix something.” There was a sound of clattering on the other end of the line, followed by Kirsty’s exasperated sigh. “No. You’re a songwriter. Your job is to write songs. It’s like chasing a fault in old wiring; you just have to keep testing the connections until you find the live one. Now stop being a walloper and get back to it. Liam has just flooded a client’s utility room by trying to connect a washing machine to the radiator pipe, and I don’t have time for your artistic crisis.”

The breakthrough, when it came, wasn’t a lightning bolt of inspiration. It was a slow, quiet dawn. Frustrated and miserable, Isla had abandoned her guitar and gone for a walk, her hands shoved deep in her pockets, her feet taking her along the familiar paths of the Water of Leith. She found herself outside an old, disused bonded warehouse, its windows blind with dust, its stonework stained with a century of rain. She remembered being on a job inside it years ago, tracing the building’s ancient, cloth-covered wiring, the scent of old dust and ozone thick in the air. She thought of that smell, so familiar it was a part of her. She thought of the physical feeling of connecting a circuit, that small, satisfying click as a current found its path. She thought of the specific, weary ache in her shoulders after a long day up a ladder. She pulled out her phone and, in the voice memo app, began to talk, not to sing. She described the feel of a cold copper wire, the heft of a hammer, the language of a diagram. She talked about the logic of it, the simple, honest truth of a job done right. She was not trying to be poetic. She was just describing her life.

Back in her flat, she picked up her guitar. She didn’t try to write a song. She just tried to find the musical equivalent of those feelings. The chords that emerged were not ‘nice’. They were sturdy, rhythmic, built around a low, resonant drone, like the hum of a substation. The melody was simple, almost a work-chant, and the words, when they came, were not about sunsets or broken hearts. They were about her hands, about dust, about the difference between a live wire and a dead one. *‘Got copper in my bloodline, got dust upon my sleeves, got a language in my fingers that my own damn mouth won’t speak.’* It was clunky and unpolished, but it was real. It was the first honest thing she had written in weeks. When she played it for Chloe that evening, her sister listened with a new kind of attention. She didn’t look bored or critical. At the end, she was quiet for a long time. “Again,” she said, her voice soft. Isla played it again, and this time Chloe closed her eyes, nodding slowly in time with the rhythm. When it was over, she opened her eyes and gave Isla a small, tired, but genuine smile. “That’s… a start,” she said. It was the highest praise she had ever given.

From that small crack of light, the album began to grow. Isla stopped trying to be a songwriter and just started telling the truth. She wrote a song about the relentless, rhythmic beeping of the machines in the ICU, building it around a tense, repeating guitar pattern that made the listener’s heart race. She wrote about the strange, suspended reality of the hospital waiting room, a quiet, mournful ballad that captured the specific shade of beige and despair. She even wrote a song for Liam, a funny, affectionate acoustic shuffle about a well-meaning apprentice who was a danger to himself and others. The songs were a mosaic of her life, filled with the specific, concrete details that made them universal: the smell of bacon rolls in the van, the accusatory stare of Mrs Carmichael’s porcelain cats, the gentle weight of her dad’s hand on her shoulder. She and Chloe developed a new language, a shorthand of nods and gestures. Isla would play a verse, and Chloe would tap her chest – “more heart” – or her head – “too clever, not enough feeling.” They were collaborators, weaving the story of their shared trauma and its messy, complicated aftermath into a collection of songs. It was a hard, painful, and deeply necessary process, a kind of musical therapy for them both.

The three months flew by in a blur of rewrites, arguments, and small, incremental victories. The folder of lyrics grew thicker, the voice notes on her phone became a sprawling, chaotic library of ideas. The album had a shape, a narrative arc from darkness to a fragile, hard-won light. The day before she was due to leave for Glasgow, Isla sat in the living room and played the whole thing, from start to finish, for her family. Ewan sat in his armchair, his eyes closed, his face a landscape of quiet emotion. Sharon cried softly into a handkerchief. Kirsty, leaning against the doorframe, just nodded, her expression fierce and proud. Chloe, in her wheelchair, didn't move a muscle, but her focus was absolute, her gaze fixed on her sister. When the last song, a quiet, hopeful instrumental that felt like a sunrise, faded into silence, no one spoke. The music had said everything. Isla looked at the faces of the people she loved, the people who had held her together, and felt a profound, bone-deep gratitude. The songs weren’t just hers anymore; they belonged to all of them. The next morning, as she packed her battered guitar case, she noticed her hands. The deep callouses had faded, replaced by the smaller, harder pads of a musician. She was still both, still the electrician and the singer, but the balance had shifted. This time, as she prepared to make the journey along the M8, there was no fear. There was only the quiet, steady focus of a tradeswoman with a job to do. She was going to build an album.The studio in Glasgow welcomed her with the same familiar scent of hot valves, old wood, and strong coffee, but this time, Isla walked through the battered red door not as a supplicant but as a contractor arriving for a job. Her guitar case felt less like a burden and more like a toolbox, and under her other arm, she carried a thick, dog-eared notebook filled with the raw materials of the last three months: lyrics, chord charts, and margin notes scrawled in Chloe’s spiky, determined hand. Alistair Macleod greeted her not with a test, but with a whiteboard. Upon it, in his neat, blocky handwriting, were the titles of her songs, arranged in a deliberate arc. ‘ICU (Beep, Beep, Beep)’, ‘Waiting Room Beige’, ‘Copper in my Bloodline’, ‘The Boy Who Floods’. It was the story of the last year, mapped out like a wiring diagram. “This is the narrative,” Alistair said, tapping the board with his finger. “From the dark to the light. We build it piece by piece, but we never forget the shape of the whole thing. Ready to get to work?”

The first week was an exercise in methodical construction, a process that felt comfortingly familiar to Isla’s trade-schooled mind. They started with the spine of the album, laying down the core tracks of her voice and acoustic guitar. Alistair’s approach was that of a master craftsman, patient and precise. He didn't chase a mythical, perfect take. Instead, he had her play each song through multiple times, capturing different nuances, different emotional textures. He was gathering the materials he would need for the final build. They began with ‘Copper in my Bloodline’, the song about her work, its steady, rhythmic pulse a solid foundation to build upon. In the quiet, wood-panelled room, with only the microphone for company, Isla found her groove. This wasn’t a performance; it was a deposition. She was simply telling the truth, one song at a time, her voice and guitar the only tools she needed. The work was focused, repetitive, and deeply satisfying, each completed track feeling like a clean, solid connection made in a complex circuit.

It was at the beginning of the second week that Alistair moved from capturing her work to challenging it. “The sound is honest,” he said, as they listened back to the stark, mournful track they had provisionally titled ‘Waiting Room Beige’. “But the silence in that room, the feeling you describe, it’s not just empty. It’s full of unspoken things. The song needs more texture. More ghosts.” He suggested a cello, and for the tense, rhythmic ICU track, a string quartet. Isla felt an immediate, visceral jolt of fear. She had written these songs in the solitary confinement of her own head, with Chloe as her only audience. The thought of letting other people in, especially classically trained musicians who could probably read music before they could walk, felt like a terrifying intrusion. They wouldn't understand the specific, ugly truth of these sounds. They would try to make it beautiful, and that would ruin everything.

The string quartet arrived on a Tuesday morning, two men and two women who exuded a quiet, intimidating professionalism. They unpacked their gleaming, ancient instruments and looked at the simple chord charts Isla had nervously handed them with polite, unreadable expressions. Alistair, sensing Isla’s terror, just gave her a small nod that said, *Your song. Your story. You lead.* They started with the waiting room ballad. The quartet played, their bows moving in perfect, graceful unison, weaving a sound that was achingly beautiful, lush with a cinematic sadness. It was gorgeous, and it was completely, fundamentally wrong. It sounded like the soundtrack to a tragic film, not the numb, airless, soul-crushing reality of sitting on a hard plastic chair under fluorescent lights, waiting for a verdict on your sister’s life. Isla’s heart hammered in her chest. She had to stop them. It felt impossibly arrogant, like telling a master stonemason he was holding his chisel wrong.

Taking a deep breath that did nothing to calm her, she raised her hand. “I’m sorry,” she said, her voice small in the large room. “That’s… that’s not it.” The musicians stopped, their bows hovering over their strings, their expressions patient but questioning. Isla struggled to translate her raw, visceral memory into a language they could understand. “It shouldn’t sound sad,” she tried to explain, her hands gesturing uselessly in the air. “It should sound… stuck. Like time has stopped. Like you’re listening to the hum of the vending machine and the squeak of a nurse’s shoes, and that’s the whole world. It’s not beautiful. It’s just… grey.” She saw a flicker of understanding in the lead violinist’s eyes. "Show us," the woman said, her voice kind. Isla turned to the cellist. “Can you just play one note? A low C. But not a clean one. A bit rough. And just hold it. Don’t let it swell. Just… let it hang there.” To the violinists, she said, “No long notes. Just short, quiet plucks. Like a clock ticking. But irregularly. So you can’t get comfortable with the rhythm.” The musicians exchanged glances, a silent, professional communication, and then they tried it. The sound that emerged was uncanny. The droning, rough cello note created a bed of unease, while the scattered, unresolved pizzicato notes from the violins were like anxious thoughts flitting through a sleepless mind. It was the sound of waiting. It was perfect. “Aye,” Isla whispered, a wave of relief washing over her. “That’s it. That’s the sound of that room.”

The recording process settled into a new rhythm, a collaboration that pushed Isla to the edge of her creative and emotional limits. Late one night, they were wrestling with the ICU track. The strings were playing the tense, jarring rhythm she had written, but something was missing. It was technically correct, but it lacked the terrifying, mechanical heartlessness she remembered. Exhausted and frustrated, she took a break and called home. Chloe answered, her voice groggy with sleep. Isla tried to explain the musical problem, talking about string arrangements and dynamics. Chloe cut her off. “What did it… feel… like?” she asked, her simple question slicing through all the technical jargon. Isla closed her eyes, instantly transported back to that sterile, beeping room. “It felt… like a machine was in charge,” she said. “Like the machines were breathing for her. Like her heartbeat wasn’t hers anymore. It was just a number on a screen.” There was a pause. “Then make… the strings… a machine,” Chloe said, her logic as brutal and clear as ever. “Not… people. A machine.” Isla hung up the phone, her mind racing. She went back into the studio and spoke to the quartet. “Forget about emotion,” she told them. “I want you to play as if you have no feeling at all. Play it like you’re a machine. Perfect time. No warmth. Every note exactly the same as the last. Relentless.” They tried it, and the effect was chilling. The music became a terrifying, precise engine, the repeating rhythm of the beeps and breaths of the life-support system. Alistair, at the mixing desk, just nodded slowly, his eyes closed. They had found it.

On the final day of recording, the studio was quiet. All the tracks were laid down, the visiting musicians had departed, leaving only Isla and Alistair. The whiteboard, once a clean plan, was now a chaotic mess of notes and amendments, the evidence of their journey. Alistair had spent the morning creating a rough mix of the entire album, and now, it was time to listen. Isla sank into the worn leather sofa, her body thrumming with a profound, bone-deep exhaustion she hadn't felt since the earliest days of starting her own business. Alistair hit the play button, and the story began. The album flowed from the cold, mechanical terror of the ICU to the grey, suspended animation of the waiting room, through the earthy, rhythmic pulse of the work songs, and finally, into the quiet, hesitant hope of the newer melodies, culminating in the sunrise chords of the closing instrumental. It was her life. It was their life, condensed into forty-seven minutes of sound. It was all there: the fear, the anger, the love, the grit, the profound, everyday miracle of healing. It existed now, separate from her, a solid, tangible thing built from the most intangible parts of her soul. When the last note faded into silence, Isla couldn't move. She just sat there, tears she hadn't realised were forming tracking silently down her face. Alistair let the silence hang for a long moment before swivelling in his big chair. He looked not at her, but at the speakers, as if the music were still visible in the air. "Well, lass," he said, his voice a low, satisfied rumble. "You built it." He turned to face her then, a rare, wide smile cracking his craggy face. "Now comes the easy part. We let people hear it."The journey home from Glasgow was shrouded in a peaceful, weary silence. The M8, a ribbon of tarmac that had become a timeline of her family’s trauma and recovery, felt different this time. It was no longer a place of ghosts but a neutral space, a simple stretch of road connecting two distinct parts of her life. Isla leaned her head against the passenger window, the van’s familiar rumble a comforting bass note beneath the quiet hum of the tyres. She was hollowed out, scoured clean by the intensity of the last few weeks, but it was the clean, satisfying emptiness of a job well done. She had built the album. The circuit was complete, tested, and ready for power. Kirsty, beside her, drove with a relaxed focus, the usual restless energy in her hands stilled. She didn't press for details or offer congratulations, understanding with an unspoken intimacy that what had happened in that studio was beyond casual conversation. As the familiar, jagged silhouette of the Edinburgh skyline appeared on the horizon, Kirsty finally spoke, her voice low. “So,” she said, not taking her eyes off the road. “Is there any of that fancy whisky left?”

The official listening party was an unceremonious affair held in the Corstorphine living room, an event so low-key it felt almost clandestine. Isla, using a small Bluetooth speaker that felt wholly inadequate for the task, simply pressed play and then sat on the floor, her back against the sofa, unable to watch the faces of her family. She stared at the intricate pattern on the worn Persian rug as the story of the last year unfolded in sound, filling the room she had come to know better than any other. The album began with the cold, mechanical heartbeat of the ICU track. Isla heard a small, sharp intake of breath from her mum and felt a familiar urge to apologise, to turn it off, to protect them from the memory. But she didn't move. This was the deal. The truth, unvarnished.

She tracked the album’s progress through the room’s reactions. During ‘Waiting Room Beige’, she heard the quiet rustle of Ewan shifting in his armchair, a sound of profound discomfort she knew intimately. When the raw, driving rhythm of ‘Copper in my Bloodline’ kicked in, she sensed Kirsty’s head begin to nod in time, a silent, primal approval. The funny, affectionate song about Liam earned a watery chuckle from Sharon. And through it all, Chloe was a statue in her wheelchair, a silent, unmoving centre of gravity. When the last, hopeful chord of the final instrumental faded into silence, the quiet it left behind was dense and charged. Isla braced herself, her muscles tight. “Well,” Ewan said, his voice thick and rough. He cleared his throat. “You can… you can really hear the dust in that one about the work.” It was a strange, specific, and deeply moving compliment. Sharon, dabbing her eyes with a tissue, just whispered, “Oh, Isla, hen. It’s so… much.” Kirsty unfolded herself from the doorway she’d been leaning against. “It’s a belter, Sparky,” she said, her voice gruff with emotion. “It’s a proper album.”

Isla finally looked at Chloe. Her sister’s face was pale, her expression unreadable. She had her eyes closed, as if listening to the album’s echo. After a long moment, she opened them and met Isla’s gaze. Her own eyes were bright with unshed tears. She didn't offer a critique or an analysis. She just reached out her hand, palm up, an invitation. Isla went to her, kneeling on the floor beside the wheelchair, and placed her hand in her sister's. Chloe’s fingers closed around hers, her grip firm and sure. “You told,” Chloe whispered, her voice barely audible but perfectly clear. “You told the… story.” It was absolution. It was the only review that would ever truly matter.

The weeks between the album’s completion and its scheduled release in late summer were a strange, restless interlude. Isla went back to work, a process that felt both like a comforting return and a subtle demotion. Liam, the temporary apprentice, was a changed man. His terror had been replaced by a quiet competence, and he now looked at Isla with a kind of baffled reverence, as if she were a visiting astronaut who had inexplicably decided to help him fix a faulty thermostat. He stayed on, his wages now a legitimate business expense on Chloe’s meticulously managed accounts, and Sparks Electrical became, for the first time, a three-person operation. The familiar routine of early starts, bacon rolls, and the physical, problem-solving reality of the job was a necessary anchor. It tethered Isla to the earth while a part of her spirit was holding its breath, waiting for the album to be released into the wild.

The day arrived with a stunning lack of fanfare. There was no launch party, no media frenzy. Alistair’s strategy was a slow burn, letting the music find its own way. The album, simply titled ‘Live Wire’, with its stark cover photo of a single, vintage filament bulb glowing against a dark, textured background, was released on a Friday. Isla spent the day with Kirsty and Liam in the crawlspace of an office building, pulling ancient data cables, the air thick with dust and the smell of decaying ceiling tiles. Her phone buzzed intermittently in her pocket with messages of goodwill from friends, but she ignored them. It felt safer down here in the dark, where the only thing that mattered was connecting the right wire to the right port. When they finally emerged into the late afternoon sunlight, blinking and filthy, Kirsty was already scrolling through her phone. “Right,” she said, her voice carefully neutral. “There’s a review. A blog. ‘Folk Forward Scotland’.” She read aloud, “'Isla Sparkes’ debut is a rare and precious thing: an album that feels less like it was written and more like it was excavated. ‘Live Wire’ is a raw, unflinching, and deeply moving song cycle that finds extraordinary beauty in the grit of ordinary life… It documents a journey through trauma with a tradeswoman’s practicality and a poet’s soul. This isn’t just a great Scottish folk album; it’s a great album, period. Buy it.'” She lowered the phone, her tough facade cracking into a brilliant smile. “A tradeswoman’s practicality and a poet’s soul,” she repeated softly. “They get it, Sparky. They actually get it.” Isla felt a dizzying wave of relief so profound it almost buckled her knees. She just nodded, unable to speak, a grin spreading across her dirt-streaked face.

That evening, after she had showered away the grime of the day, she walked into town, needing to be surrounded by the anonymous bustle of the city. She found herself outside a small, fiercely independent record shop in the Old Town, the kind of place that smelled of vinyl and righteousness. And there it was. In the window, displayed prominently between a classic Tom Waits reissue and the new album by a critically acclaimed American artist, was her own record. ‘Isla Sparkes - Live Wire’. The glowing filament on the cover seemed to thrum with a quiet energy. She stood on the pavement, a stranger among strangers, and just looked at it. It was real. A couple walked past, stopped, and the woman pointed to the album. “Oh, that’s the one my sister was telling me about,” she said to her partner. “The one with the song about the hospital. Said it made her weep on the bus.” They went inside the shop. Isla stayed where she was, a slow, quiet smile spreading across her face. Her story, their story, was no longer just hers. It was out in the world, making its own connections, finding its own path, bringing its own small, specific light to the darkness.The quiet success of ‘Live Wire’ was a strange, creeping tide. It did not roar in like a hurricane, as the Britain’s Got Talent phenomenon had threatened to do, but seeped slowly into the cultural groundwater. After the first few glowing online reviews, a respected broadsheet newspaper ran a feature, not in its frothy entertainment section, but in its serious arts pages, analysing the album’s narrative structure and its raw, authentic voice. A well-known novelist tweeted a picture of the album cover with the caption, ‘This is what truth sounds like.’ The biggest shock came when a late-night, influential music show on national radio played ‘Copper in my Bloodline’ and the host spent the next five minutes talking about the poetry of skilled manual labour, a concept so foreign to the usual discourse of pop music that it felt revolutionary. The album began to appear in the indie charts, a slow, steady climb driven not by a marketing machine, but by a genuine, word-of-mouth connection with listeners who heard their own lives reflected in its honest, unadorned stories. For Isla, this success was an abstract phenomenon, something she observed from a great distance, like watching a weather report for a distant country. Her reality remained the smell of damp plaster, the satisfying heft of a well-balanced hammer, and the constant, witty, and deeply profane stream of commentary from Kirsty as they navigated the daily challenges of their trade.

At home, the power dynamics had undergone a seismic shift. Chloe, from her command centre at the dining table, had quietly and efficiently annexed control of every aspect of Isla’s nascent music career. Her verbal communication was still a painstaking, deliberate process, but her digital fluency was terrifying. She had mastered email with a ruthless brevity, her terse, no-nonsense replies to inquiries from bloggers, radio producers, and small-town festival organisers becoming legendary in their own right. A fawning email from a music journalist asking for a lengthy interview about Isla’s ‘emotional journey’ received a one-sentence reply from Chloe: ‘Isla is a working electrician. She can do a twenty-minute phone call next Tuesday at 7 p.m. That is all.’ She managed the trickle of royalties, tracked the sales figures, and curated a spreadsheet of reviews with a level of forensic detail that was both awe-inspiring and deeply unsettling. She was no longer a patient recovering; she was a manager, sharp-minded and fiercely protective, wielding her tablet like a weapon and a shield. Isla found herself in the bizarre position of having to ask her younger sister, who still required help to navigate a flight of stairs, for permission to do an interview.

The call that changed the weather came on a wet Thursday afternoon. Isla was shoulder-deep in the guts of a commercial coffee machine at the George Street café, trying to isolate a short that kept tripping the main breaker, when her phone rang. Seeing it was Alistair, she wiped her greasy hands on her jeans and answered, expecting a routine question about publishing rights. “Isla,” he said, his voice carrying the usual calm authority. “I’ve just had a long chat with an agent. Do you know the music of Michael Hannon?” Isla’s breath caught. Michael Hannon was not just a musician; he was an institution, a legendary Irish singer-songwriter whose work was woven into the very fabric of modern folk music. His songs were taught in schools; his lyrics were quoted in literary journals. “Of course I know him,” Isla said, her voice a reverent whisper. “Well,” Alistair continued, “it seems he knows you. He heard the album. He likes the songs about work. Says they remind him of the stories his father used to tell. He’s doing a UK tour in the autumn, twenty dates, all the big seated venues, the Barbican in London, the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. He’s asked for you, personally, to be his support act.”

The words seemed to bend the air in the noisy café. The hiss of the espresso machine, the clatter of cups, the murmur of conversation—it all faded into a distant roar. A twenty-date tour. The Barbican. Supporting Michael Hannon. It wasn’t a showcase or a folk club. It was the big league, the real thing. It was an apprenticeship with a master. Her mind, her practical, electrician’s mind, immediately began to run through the logistical impossibilities. Twenty dates meant at least a month on the road. A month away from work. A month away from her family. A month away from Chloe. “I… Alistair, I can’t,” she stammered, the refusal a gut reflex. “The business… my sister… it’s not possible.” There was a patient sigh on the other end of the line. “Isla, I’m not asking you for an answer right now. I’m telling you what’s on the table. Talk to your people. The offer is formal, and it will stand for one week. This is the next chapter, lass. If you want to write it.” He hung up, leaving Isla standing in the middle of a bustling café, her heart pounding a frantic, terrified rhythm, the smell of coffee and ozone filling her senses. The circuit of her life had just been hit with a voltage spike so massive it threatened to blow every fuse she had.

That evening’s board meeting was a tense, sober affair. The fish and chips sat largely untouched on their plates. Isla laid out the offer from Alistair, her voice flat and detached as she detailed the dates, the venues, the sheer, daunting scale of it. She presented it not as an opportunity, but as an insurmountable problem, a beautiful, impossible dream. “A month,” she concluded, shaking her head. “There’s no way. Kirsty can’t run the business with just Liam for a whole month, and I can’t just leave you all. It’s too much.” She looked to Kirsty for confirmation, expecting her to nod, to agree that this was a bridge too far. But Kirsty was quiet, her gaze fixed on Chloe. Ewan and Sharon looked pale and worried, caught between a fierce pride and a deep-seated parental anxiety. The silence stretched, filled only by the ticking of the hall clock.

It was Chloe who finally broke it. She wheeled herself closer to the table, her tablet in her lap. She didn’t look at Isla. She looked at Kirsty. “The new build,” she said, her speech slow and deliberate, but with a new, hard-won authority. “The flats in Bruntsfield. The electrical contract. We won it?” Kirsty nodded, confused. “Aye. Starts in October. It’s our biggest job yet. Why?” “Good,” Chloe said. She tapped at her tablet, her fingers moving with a slow, precise certainty. She turned the screen around for them all to see. On it was a spreadsheet. It was titled: ‘M. HANNON TOUR - OPERATIONAL PLAN’. Her plan was audacious, terrifying, and brilliant. She had broken down the tour schedule, cross-referencing it with the Bruntsfield job’s timeline. She proposed not just keeping Liam on, but hiring another experienced electrician on a fixed-term contract, to be funded by the profits from the new build. She had calculated the tour fee against the cost of a tour manager (a role for which she had, Isla noted with a jolt, pencilled in her own name), van rental, fuel, and cheap hotels. She had mapped it all out. It wasn’t a dream; it was a project, with costs, risks, and a clear critical path. “You,” she said, pointing at Kirsty. “You… are site foreman. You manage… the team.” Then she pointed at Isla. “You… are the product. Your job… is to sing.” Finally, she tapped her own chest. “And I… am the boss.”

A stunned silence filled the room. Isla stared at the spreadsheet, at the cold, hard, logistical proof that this impossible thing was, in fact, possible. She saw the hours, the days of work Chloe must have put into this, the fierce, unsentimental intelligence she had brought to bear on Isla’s dream. She had not seen an obstacle; she had seen a complex system that needed to be re-wired. A wave of emotion so powerful it made her dizzy washed over Isla—awe at her sister’s resilience, gratitude for her ferocious belief, and a profound, humbling love. She looked up from the tablet and met Chloe’s gaze. Her sister’s eyes were clear and challenging. There was no room for fear or excuses in Chloe’s world, only problems and solutions. “Okay, boss,” Isla said, her voice husky. “What’s my first job?” Chloe’s face broke into a slow, triumphant smile. “Practice,” she said. “Your G-string… sounds flat.”
