The slate roofs of Cwm Coch glistened with a perpetual dampness, a silver sheen on a grey town. Rhys thought of it as the skin of a fish, caught and laid out under the endless, moody sky. He liked the thought. It made the familiar seem strange, and the strange, in its own way, beautiful. He moved through the narrow dining room of The Gilded Leek with a practiced economy of motion, his body a well-oiled machine of hospitality. A bottle of Malbec uncorked without a whisper, a plate of cawl delivered without a slosh, a smile offered that was just warm enough, just distant enough. This was his stage, these few dozen square feet of polished floorboards and starched linen, and he was, for eight hours a day, the master of its small ceremonies.

He knew the grain of every table, the specific squeak of the third chair from the window, the way the late afternoon sun would catch the dust motes dancing over the empty dessert trolley and turn them into a fleeting galaxy. He was good at this. It wasn't a grand ambition, being a waiter, but it was a craft. There was a rhythm to a busy service, a chaotic music of clattering cutlery, rising conversation, and the hiss of the kitchen. Rhys was its conductor, smoothing the transitions, calming the crescendos, ensuring the final note of the evening was one of satisfied silence. Mr. Davies, the owner, a man whose gut strained the buttons of his waistcoat and whose patience was thinner than a communion wafer, called him reliable. "Rhys is reliable," he’d say, which in Mr. Davies’s limited vocabulary was the highest form of praise, just a notch below "profitable."

Tonight was a Saturday. A proper Saturday, the air thick with the promise of rain and the scent of frying onions. The Gilded Leek was full, a noisy, cheerful ark against the encroaching Welsh gloom. Rhys glided between a table of regulars dissecting the local rugby match and a young couple on a first date, their silence as loud as any argument. He felt a detached fondness for them all, these temporary inhabitants of his world. He was the constant, the quiet observer of their fleeting dramas. His mind, usually a placid lake, was already turning towards Tuesday, towards Mrs. Bevan’s local history class. He was tracing the imagined ley lines under Cwm Coch, the forgotten paths and ancient grudges that she brought to life with such dry, academic passion. It was a world away from medium-rare steaks and complaints about corked wine. It was a place where things had meaning, where the stones in the harbour wall had stories to tell.

The trouble arrived at table seven. A family of four, tourists by their bright, impractical coats and their loud, open vowels. They were celebrating a birthday; the father, a large man with a florid face, had announced it to Rhys as if expecting a round of applause. They were halfway through their main course, two steaks and two sea bass, when the father, deep in an anecdote that involved a lost caravan and a stubborn sheep, gestured extravagantly with his steak knife. The gesture was too wide, the story too engrossing. The knife, slick with gravy, slipped from his grasp. It wasn't a dramatic, cinematic flight. It was a clumsy, awkward little tumble. The tip of it skittered across the table and caught the back of his wife's hand, which was resting near her wine glass.

It was a nothing cut. A scratch. A tiny, crimson welling that was more surprising than painful. The woman let out a small, sharp gasp, a bird-like sound of shock. But it wasn't the sound that snagged in Rhys’s brain. It was the sight. The perfect, vivid bead of red that blossomed on her pale skin. In the same moment, her startled hand knocked her wine glass. A deep, blood-red Merlot spilled across the pristine white tablecloth, a tidal wave of crimson soaking into the fibres, branching out like a dark, terrible root system.

The world, for Rhys, tilted on its axis. The cheerful din of the restaurant faded into a dull, distant roar, like the sea heard from inside a seashell. The two reds—the small, perfect drop on the woman's hand and the sprawling, chaotic stain on the cloth—seemed to merge in his vision. They pulsed. The colour was suddenly obscene, impossibly loud. It wasn't just red; it was the very essence of opened, of spilled, of wrongness. His breath caught in his throat, a sharp, painful hook. The tray in his hand, bearing two coffees and a jug of cream for table four, suddenly weighed a thousand pounds. His knuckles were white. He could feel the blood draining from his own face, a cold tide receding and leaving him numb. The woman at the table was laughing it off, wrapping a napkin around her hand. "Oh, Gerald, you clumsy oaf," she was saying, but her voice was distorted, stretched into a meaningless warble. All Rhys could see was the small patch of red beginning to soak through the paper napkin. A new flower of horror.

His panic was a trapped bird, beating frantic, silent wings against the cage of his ribs. His vision tunnelled until the only things that existed in the entire universe were those splashes of red. They were holes in the fabric of reality, and he was falling into them. He needed to move, to help, to do his job, but his feet were nailed to the floor. The polished wood seemed to turn to mud, sucking him down. He could feel the eyes of the other diners on him, their curiosity turning to confusion. Mr. Davies was moving towards him from the bar, his face a thundercloud. "Rhys?"

The name didn't register. The only sound Rhys could truly hear was the frantic, liquid thumping in his own ears. A drop of sweat trickled down his temple, cold as ice. He had to get away from the colour. He had to make it stop. His hands, acting of their own accord, simply opened. The tray fell. It seemed to take an age to hit the floor, a slow-motion catastrophe of shattering porcelain and splashing coffee. The crash was the sound that finally broke the spell, but it broke it all wrong. It was like an explosion in the suffocating silence of his mind. He stumbled backwards, tripping over a chair leg, his arms flailing. He felt a hand on his arm, firm, insistent. It was Dafydd, one of the younger waiters. "Rhys, mun, come on. Out the back. Get some air."

Rhys allowed himself to be led, a puppet with its strings cut. He was vaguely aware of Mr. Davies’s apoplectic face, the shocked silence of the diners, the shame that was now a hot flush crawling up his neck. The kitchen was a blur of steam and stainless steel. Then the fire exit door was pushed open and the cold, damp night air hit him like a physical blow. He leaned against the rough brick of the alley wall, dragging air into his lungs in ragged, desperate gulps. The alley smelled of wet bins and stale beer, a familiar, grounding ugliness. He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, but the image was seared onto the back of his eyelids: a tiny, perfect drop of blood on a woman’s hand, monstrous and vast as a dying star. He didn't understand. He had seen cuts before. He had fallen off his bike as a boy, seen rugby injuries, nicked himself shaving. But this was different. This wasn't a memory or an experience. It was an invasion. Something had broken inside him, a wire had snapped, and he had no idea how to fix it. He just stood there, shaking in the dark, while the cheerful sounds of the restaurant he could no longer face trickled out from behind the door.

The next morning, the sky was the colour of a bruise. Rhys walked to The Gilded Leek with a sense of dread coiling in his stomach. He hadn't slept. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the spilt wine, the blooming red. Mr. Davies was waiting for him in the empty dining room, polishing cutlery with a furious, rhythmic energy. He didn't look up.

"I had to comp their whole meal," he said, his voice flat. "Table seven. And the coffees for table four. And Mrs. Hughes at table two said the commotion 'ruined her digestion'." He finally looked at Rhys, his small, dark eyes like chips of flint. "What was that, Rhys? In all my years, I've never seen anything like it. You froze. You looked like you'd seen a boggart."

Rhys swallowed. The words felt like stones in his mouth. "I don't know, Mr. Davies. I just... I saw the... the blood." He couldn't bring himself to say the word properly. It felt sharp.

Mr. Davies slammed a handful of forks onto the table. "Blood? It was a scratch, for God's sake! A pinprick! My daughter gets worse from a rose bush. You're a grown man, not a squeamish schoolgirl. What if it had been serious? What if someone had properly injured themselves? You're supposed to be the reliable one." The accusation hung in the air, heavier than the scent of last night's fish.

"I know. I'm sorry. It won't happen again," Rhys said, the words a hollow promise even to his own ears.

"You're damned right it won't," Mr. Davies grunted, but there was no forgiveness in it. "You're on thin ice, my lad. I can't have my senior waiter fainting at the sight of a bit of claret. Pull yourself together."

Pull yourself together. The words were a dismissal. A wall. Rhys wanted to explain the sheer, visceral terror of it, the way the world had buckled, but he knew it was useless. To Mr. Davies, it was a simple failure of nerve, a flaw in the machinery. Rhys was no longer reliable. He was a problem. Dafydd found him in the small staff room, staring at his reflection in the cracked mirror. He looked pale, haunted.

"Rough one, eh?" Dafydd said, clapping him on the shoulder. "Don't worry about old Davies, his bark's worse than his bite. Mostly." He grinned. "Still, proper dramatic, that was. Like something out of a film. We were thinking of putting a warning on the steak knives. 'May cause fainting in sensitive waiters'."

Rhys flinched. The joke, however kindly meant, landed like a punch. He was a story now. A source of mild amusement. The man who dropped a tray because of a scratch. He forced a weak smile. "Yeah. Hilarious." He spent the rest of his shift on edge, his eyes scanning the tables not for empty glasses, but for potential hazards. A wine bottle seemed to loom with menace. The rare steaks that came from the kitchen made his stomach clench. He felt exposed, a fraud in his own uniform. The easy grace he once possessed was gone, replaced by a stiff, wooden caution. He felt like a stranger in his own skin, in his own life.

Walking home, he took the long way, past the community hall. The lights were on inside, casting warm, yellow rectangles onto the wet pavement. He could almost hear Mrs. Bevan's voice, calm and measured, talking about the Roman garrisons or the rise of the Welsh princes. She spoke of history as something solid, something you could hold and understand. A world of facts and timelines, of cause and effect. It was a world so starkly different from the new, terrifying chaos that had taken root in his own head, a world where a single drop of red could shatter everything. He paused for a moment, his hand resting on the cold, damp stone of the hall's wall, and wished, more than anything, that he could just go inside and listen, and leave the man who was afraid of blood outside in the rain. But he couldn't. That man was him now.He pulled his hand away from the cold stone as if it had burned him. The thought of entering the hall felt like a transgression, as if his new, broken self would somehow contaminate the quiet order within. He turned and walked on, the rhythmic slap of his shoes on the wet pavement the only sound accompanying the frantic thrumming in his chest. The town he knew so intimately had become a hostile landscape. The cheerful red of a postbox seemed to scream at him from across the street; the taillights of a passing car left bloody trails on his vision. He saw a child’s bright red wellington boots and felt a lurch of nausea, forcing himself to look away, to focus on the grey slate, the grey sky, the comforting, neutral tones of his hometown.

His flat was a small, neat space above a long-since-closed bakery. It had always been his sanctuary, a quiet harbour after the social storm of the restaurant. But tonight, as he turned the key in the lock, he felt he was bringing the enemy in with him. In the small kitchen, he went to make a cup of tea, a ritual of calming simplicity. But his eyes snagged on the butcher's calendar hanging by the door, a freebie from last Christmas. The block lettering for 'Sunday' was printed in a bold, cheerful red. He felt the same sickening jolt as before, a physical recoil. He tore the calendar from its pin with a sharp, angry tug, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it into the bin as if it were a venomous insect. He stood there, breathing heavily, staring at his own shaking hands. This was insane. It was just a colour.

Sleep, when it finally came, offered no respite. It was a shallow, restless state populated by crimson tides and shattering porcelain. He dreamt he was swimming in a vast vat of Merlot, the thick, cloying liquid filling his mouth and lungs, and he woke with a gasp, his heart hammering against his ribs, the sheets tangled around his legs. The following two days at The Gilded Leek were a quiet, sustained form of torture. He moved through the dining room like a ghost of his former self, the effortless grace replaced by a rigid, fearful vigilance. His professional smile was a mask of stretched plaster, and he felt the gazes of the other staff and even some of the regulars, their looks a mixture of pity and morbid curiosity.

Every order was a potential ambush. When a customer ordered a bottle of Rioja, his hands trembled so much that Dafydd had to take over opening it, giving him a look that was more worried than mocking this time. When a medium-rare steak was returned to the kitchen for being 'too pink', Rhys had to turn away from the plate, a wave of dizziness washing over him at the sight of the bloody juices pooling around the meat. He was no longer the conductor of the chaotic symphony; he was a discordant note, a player who had forgotten the music, fumbling and out of time. Mr. Davies circled him like a shark, his silence more damning than any tirade. The unspoken question was always there: when would he break again? The reliability that had been his sole, sturdy virtue was gone, and without it, he was just another pair of hands, and clumsy ones at that.

By Tuesday evening, Rhys felt hollowed out, a fragile shell of a man. The thought of another shift, of facing another bottle of red wine or another steak, was unbearable. The history class was no longer a gentle interest; it was a lifeline. He changed out of his waiter's uniform and walked to the community hall not with the dread of the past few days, but with a desperate, shaky sense of purpose. He pushed open the heavy door and was met with the scent of floor polish, old books, and weak tea from a thermos. About fifteen people, mostly of retirement age, were sat in mismatched plastic chairs, their attention focused on a woman at the front of the room. This was Mrs. Bevan. She was a small, bird-like woman with sharp, intelligent eyes behind thick spectacles and a tweed jacket that had seen better decades. She stood beside a projector screen displaying a black-and-white photograph of the Cwm Coch harbour from the turn of the century. Her voice was exactly as he had imagined: crisp, clear, and utterly devoid of drama. She was talking about herring fleets and the price of salt. It was a world of solid, verifiable things. Rhys slipped into a vacant chair at the back, his shoulders, which had been hunched in a permanent cringe for days, beginning to relax for the first time since Saturday night.He sat in the back, letting the lecture wash over him. Mrs. Bevan's voice was a steady, low drone, a soothing balm on his frayed nerves. She spoke of trade routes, of weights and measures, of the slow, grinding processes that shaped the town. There was no passion in her voice, only the profound and quiet satisfaction of a person who deals in facts. For Rhys, it was like listening to a recitation of the laws of physics after having witnessed a miracle, or a curse. It was grounding. He focused on the details: the tonnage of slate exported in 1888, the names of the families who owned the fishing smacks, the slow silting of the harbour mouth. Each fact was a small, solid stone he could use to rebuild the wall around his own crumbling psyche.

The projector clicked, and a new image appeared on the screen. It was a faded sepia photograph of a group of men, their faces smudged with coal dust, standing grim-faced at the entrance to a mine shaft. "Of course," Mrs. Bevan said, her tone shifting almost imperceptibly, "life in Cwm Coch was not just about the sea. It was about what lay beneath the hills." She tapped the screen with a wooden pointer. "The Gwaith Goch—the 'Red Mine'—so named for the high iron content in the rock that would stain the water, and often the miners themselves, a rusty red."

Rhys stiffened. His breath hitched. *Red Mine*. The two words struck him like a physical blow. The soothing drone of the lecture was gone, replaced by the frantic thumping in his ears that he now knew so well. He stared at the black-and-white photograph, but his mind, a traitorous artist, began to colour it in. He saw the rusty water trickling down the rock face, staining the men's hands and clothes. He imagined a cut, a hand slipping on a wet piece of iron-rich ore, and a blooming stain that wasn't just rust. The plastic chair beneath him felt slick. The air in the room grew thick and hard to breathe. He was back in the restaurant, watching the wine spread across the tablecloth.

"The conditions were, by modern standards, appalling," Mrs. Bevan continued, oblivious. "Accidents were frequent. Rockfalls, gas. There's a particularly harrowing account from 1903, of a collapse that trapped three men. When they were finally reached, the rescue party's report described the scene... a 'terrible-,' well, let's just say it was not for the faint of heart." She cleared her throat, a rare concession to the grimness of the subject matter. "The point is, this town is built not just on slate and herring, but on a bedrock of hardship. Its prosperity was paid for."

Rhys squeezed his eyes shut, but it was no use. The images his mind was conjuring were more vivid than the projector screen. He saw shattered rock, the glint of a lamp on something wet and dark. The words *paid for* echoed in his head, linked inextricably with the image of spilled red. He felt a sudden, desperate need to flee, to bolt from the quiet community hall as he had from the restaurant. But he couldn't. Not again. He was not that man. He gripped the edges of his chair, his knuckles white, and forced himself to open his eyes, to look at the screen, at the calm, bespectacled face of Mrs. Bevan. He focused on her tweed jacket, on the way the light caught her glasses, on anything but the subject of her words. He breathed in, slowly, deliberately. In for four, hold for four, out for six. A trick a yoga teacher had taught him once, years ago. He repeated it, a desperate mantra against the rising tide of panic. The wave crested, hung there for a long, terrible moment, and then, miraculously, began to recede. It left him shaking, drenched in a cold sweat, but he was still in his chair. He hadn't run.

When the class ended, Rhys remained in his seat, waiting for the small crowd to disperse, feeling too drained to move. He watched the elderly attendees shuffle out, chatting about the lecture, about the weather, about their grandchildren. It was a world of such profound normalcy that it felt alien to him. Finally, only he and Mrs. Bevan were left. She was methodically packing her notes and slides into a worn leather satchel. She looked up and her sharp eyes found him in the back row.

"Enjoying the class, Mr...?" she asked, her voice carrying easily in the empty room.

"Rhys. Just Rhys," he managed to say, his own voice sounding thin and reedy. "Yes. Very much."

She gave a small, discerning nod, her gaze lingering on his pale face for a fraction longer than was polite. "You're new. I don't get many your age. Most people prefer to live in a place rather than know anything about it." She snapped her satchel shut. "You look as though you've seen a ghost."

The observation was so direct, so matter-of-fact, that Rhys was caught off guard. He had no polite deflection ready. "Something like that," he admitted, a wry, tired smile touching his lips for a moment.

"Ah," she said, as if this were a perfectly reasonable answer. "This town has plenty of them, if you know where to look. Most are just stories, of course. But stories have a weight of their own, don't they?" She moved towards the door, then paused, her hand on the light switch. "The Gwaith Goch. The Red Mine. It was a place of great tragedy. But the name wasn't just from the iron. A local legend says it was named for a massacre, long before the mining started. A skirmish between rival princes. They say the stream that ran from the hillside ran red for a week." She flicked the switch, plunging the hall into darkness, save for the weak moonlight filtering through the high windows. Her voice came out of the gloom, calm and dispassionate. "Just a story, of course. Goodnight, Rhys."

Rhys sat alone in the dark, the silence of the hall pressing in on him. Mrs. Bevan’s final words had not been comforting. A stream running red for a week. The image bloomed in his mind, vast and terrifying. It wasn't a drop of blood or a splash of wine anymore. It was a river. He felt as if her story hadn't explained a thing, but had instead given his nameless dread a history, a terrible lineage that stretched back through the centuries, rooted in the very ground beneath his feet. He had come here seeking an escape into a world of solid facts, but he had stumbled into a place where the facts themselves were stained with blood. He finally pushed himself to his feet and walked out into the night, feeling more lost than ever. The town no longer felt like his own; it felt like a haunted house, and he was beginning to learn the ghost's name.## Chapter 2

The legend Mrs. Bevan had so casually deployed was not an abstraction. Rhys felt it in the soles of his shoes, a vibration coming up from the wet pavement as he walked. He was tracing the imagined ley lines again, but they were no longer benign paths of ancient energy; they were veins, and he could almost feel a phantom pulse beneath the tarmac and stone, a deep, slow beat in time with his own racing heart. The story of the stream had given his terror a landscape, a geography. He looked up at the dark, hulking shapes of the hills that cradled Cwm Coch and for the first time they didn't seem protective. They seemed like witnesses, silent and brooding, holding the memory of that ancient red tide. He imagined the Gwaith Goch, the Red Mine, as a wound in the hillside, a wound that had never properly healed.

Back in his flat, the sterile quiet did little to calm him. The world was saturated with the offending colour, and he was an unwilling conspirator in its display. He saw the thin red spine of a book on his shelf and had to turn it to the wall. He saw the small, pilot light on his boiler and it seemed to throb with a malevolent intelligence. This was not a life. It was a siege. He went into his small bedroom and, out of a habit ingrained by years of service, laid out his uniform for the next day: the black trousers, the polished shoes, the pristine white shirt. He looked at the shirt, lying on his bed like a surrendered flag, and imagined it. He imagined a splash, a single, careless drop of red wine from a jostled glass. He saw it hit the stark white cotton, blossoming instantly, its tendrils snaking through the fibres. He felt the phantom panic, the cold dread, the frantic beat of the trapped bird in his chest.

He couldn't do it. He simply could not go back. The thought of stepping onto that stage again, of carrying a bottle of Malbec that felt like a bomb in his hands, of feigning normality while his insides screamed, was impossible. The Gilded Leek was no longer his domain; it was the scene of the crime, the place where his mind had betrayed him. To return would be to willingly walk back into the jaws of the beast. The reliability Mr. Davies had prized in him was a lie now, and to pretend otherwise was a fraud he was too exhausted to perpetrate. He folded the white shirt with ceremonial slowness, not with the crisp, efficient folds of a waiter, but with the gentle finality of someone packing away a part of their life for good. He placed it in a drawer and closed it.

He arrived at The Gilded Leek the next morning just as the delivery van was dropping off crates of vegetables. The air smelled of damp earth and diesel. He wasn't wearing his uniform, just jeans and a worn grey jumper, and he felt strangely exposed without the familiar starched armour. Mr. Davies was in his small, cluttered office just off the bar, frowning at a column of figures. He looked up as Rhys appeared in the doorway, his eyes narrowing at the sight of Rhys's civilian clothes. A flicker of irritation crossed his features, assuming a late arrival or a forgotten shift.

"I can't work here anymore, Mr. Davies," Rhys said. The words came out quietly, but they were solid, unequivocal. There was no room for argument in them. He had rehearsed a dozen explanations, apologies, and justifications, but in the end, only the simple truth remained.

Mr. Davies leaned back in his chair, the cheap wood groaning in protest. He steepled his fingers over his prominent stomach and studied Rhys for a long moment. He wasn't angry, not like the other night. This was colder. This was business. He was reassessing an asset that had suddenly proven defective. "Because of the other night," he stated. It wasn't a question.

"Yes," Rhys said. "And because it will happen again."

The honesty of that seemed to crystallize the situation for his employer. There would be no cajoling, no threats about thin ice. The machine was broken and had declared itself so. Mr. Davies gave a short, sharp nod. "Right," he said, turning back to his ledger as if Rhys were already a closed account. "I'll have your final pay ready by Friday. Leave your keys on the bar."

It was that simple. A decade of his life, of being the well-oiled machine of hospitality, of knowing the squeak of every chair and the rhythm of every service, dismissed in under thirty seconds. There was no handshake, no 'sorry to see you go'. There was only the scratch of Mr. Davies's pen on paper, a sound of absolute finality. Rhys placed his set of keys on the polished surface of the bar, the small clatter echoing in the empty dining room. He turned and walked out, the bell above the door giving a cheerful, indifferent jingle behind him.

He stood on the pavement, blinking in the thin morning light. For the first time in his adult life, he had nowhere to be. No tables to set, no wine to chill, no small ceremonies to master. The feeling was one of profound vertigo, a terrifying, bottomless freedom. His life, which had been so ordered and contained, was now a blank page, and the only word written on it was 'fear'. He started walking, with no destination in mind, his feet carrying him through the familiar streets that now felt so alien. He walked past the harbour, past the community hall, and found himself standing before the town's small, stone-built library. It was the only place that made sense. He hadn't sought facts to ground himself this time. He was a man seeking the origin of his own haunting. He pushed open the heavy oak door and walked inside, the scent of old paper and quiet enveloping him like a shroud. He was no longer Rhys, the reliable waiter. He was a researcher of his own madness, and his subject was the Gwaith Goch.The library was a hushed, orderly world, a direct inverse of the chaotic music of a restaurant. The silence here was different from the satisfied silence of a finished meal. It was older, deeper, a silence layered with the quiet thoughts of generations. Mrs. Pritchard, the librarian, a woman whose posture seemed to have been permanently straightened by the moral authority of the Dewey Decimal System, watched him from behind her large oak desk. Her glasses were perched on the end of her nose, and her eyes, magnified and inquisitive, catalogued him as a new and unusual acquisition. Rhys, feeling her gaze, walked to the small section marked 'Local History'. It felt like a confession.

The shelves were a jumble of slim, self-published pamphlets, hefty academic tomes, and yellowing council records bound in buckram. The air was thick with the sweet, dusty scent of decaying paper and binding glue. He ran his fingers along the spines, the names a litany of his quest: *The Slate Barons of North Wales*, *A Maritime History of Cardigan Bay*, *Welsh Folk Tales and Legends*. He was not a scholar. He didn't know how to conduct research. He was simply a man with a wound, searching for the weapon that made it. His hands trembled slightly as he pulled out a thick, sombre volume with a faded burgundy cover. The colour made him hesitate, but it was a dull, aged shade, like dried blood, and the initial jolt of panic was weak, manageable. The title was embossed in gilt lettering: *A Geological and Social History of the Cwm Coch Collieries, 1850-1950*.

He took the book to a carrel in the corner, a small wooden booth that offered a welcome sense of privacy. For a long while, he just sat there, his hand resting on the book’s cover, feeling the texture of the worn cloth. It felt heavy, solid. An anchor. Finally, he opened it. The pages were thick and creamy, filled with dense blocks of text and stark, black-and-white diagrams of geological strata and mine-shaft cross-sections. He skimmed past the opening chapters on the Carboniferous period and the economic conditions that led to the first sinkings. The language was dry, technical, and blessedly free of emotion. It was a language of seams and faults, of tonnage and output, of things that could be measured and understood.

Then he found the chapter he was looking for: 'The Gwaith Goch and the Ferruginous Seam'. He forced himself to read slowly, to absorb the words without letting his imagination run wild. The book confirmed Mrs. Bevan's factual account. The Gwaith Goch was named for a specific seam of coal unusually rich in iron ore deposits, primarily hematite. The author noted coolly that the groundwater pumped from the lower levels was often so discoloured by the iron oxide that it ran in the drainage gullies "with the striking appearance of watered-down blood," which often proved "a source of morbid fascination for visitors." Rhys felt a cold knot tighten in his stomach. It wasn't just a legend. It was a documented, geological fact. The hills themselves bled rust.

He read on, his focus narrowing. The book detailed the mine’s history: the initial boom, the union disputes, the slow decline. And the accidents. They were listed with a historian’s detached precision, a grim catalogue of human fragility against the immense, indifferent weight of the earth. A firedamp explosion in 1891: twelve men killed. A snapped winding-cable in 1911: four men and a boy falling to their deaths. He found a detailed account of the 1903 collapse Mrs. Bevan had mentioned. The language was still precise, but the details were horrific. It spoke of the 'integrity of the bodies' being 'severely compromised', of the 'difficult and harrowing task of extraction'. Rhys closed his eyes, his knuckles white where he gripped the edge of the table. He could hear the scrape of shovels on rock, see the dim flicker of carbide lamps in the suffocating dark. He could picture the first glimpse of red-stained water seeping from a fresh fissure in the rock face, a grim portent.

He forced his eyes open and scanned the rest of the page, wanting it to be over. And then he saw it. Tucked at the bottom of the page was a small, unassuming footnote, referenced from the first mention of the mine's name. "While the name Gwaith Goch is technically derived from the hematite present," he read, "folk etymology in the valley has long offered a more visceral explanation. An unsubstantiated but persistent local tale connects the name to a pre-industrial event, a land-dispute settled with uncommon brutality. The site of the eventual mine head was, according to this legend, the site of the massacre. However, no archaeological evidence has ever been found to support this narrative, which must be relegated to the realm of local superstition."

Relegated to the realm of local superstition. The phrase was meant to be dismissive, a scholar's tidy sweep of the untidy mess of human belief. But for Rhys, it did the opposite. It gave the story a name. It took Mrs. Bevan's campfire tale and etched it, however faintly, into the official record. It meant that for generations, people in this town had looked up at that hillside and thought not of iron ore, but of a massacre. The idea had seeped into the soil, into the collective memory, staining it just as the iron stained the water. He pushed the book away from him. He had found what he was looking for, and he had found nothing at all. He had context, history, geology, folklore. He had a dozen reasons why the colour red was woven into the fabric of his town’s difficult past. But he still had no idea why it had suddenly, on a normal Saturday night, become the key that unlocked a screaming, nameless terror inside his own head. He left the book on the table and walked out of the library, back into the grey afternoon. He felt emptier, but also heavier, as if the weight of the town's history had settled directly onto his own shoulders.The first day of his new, unemployed life was a study in silence. The familiar morning rush—the quick shower, the precise knotting of a tie, the mental checklist for the day's reservations—was replaced by a vast, echoing emptiness. The flat, usually a peaceful refuge from the clamour of his job, now felt like a prison cell. He sat at his small kitchen table, staring at the grey, damp square of the world visible through his window. Without the structure of service, time itself seemed to have lost its rhythm. The hours stretched before him, shapeless and menacing. By midday, hunger gnawed at him, a simple biological imperative he could not ignore. The fridge was bare, save for some milk and a wilting half-lettuce. He had to go out. He had to go to the shop.

The thought of the village high street, a place he had walked a thousand times without a second thought, filled him with a low, humming dread. He pulled on his coat, the mundane act feeling like a knight donning armour for a battle he knew he would lose. The Dewi Sant Co-op was only five minutes away, but the journey was an ordeal. He kept his eyes fixed on the pavement, on the comforting grey of the paving slabs, but the colour was everywhere, an ambush at every turn. A child's lost red mitten on a bench; the bright, painted sign of the chemist's shop; a smear of ketchup on a discarded chip wrapper. Each instance was a small shock, a paper cut to his psyche, and he flinched from them all, his heart stuttering in his chest.

Inside the shop, the fluorescent lights were harsh and unforgiving. He grabbed a basket and moved with a forced, unnatural purpose, trying to avoid the most dangerous aisles. Fruit and vegetables were a minefield of tomatoes, red peppers, and radishes. He skirted them, his eyes averted, and grabbed a bag of potatoes and some onions. The real test was the meat counter at the back. He needed mince, a simple staple. He approached it cautiously, as if it were an unexploded bomb. The butcher, a cheerful, ruddy-faced man named Gareth, was arranging lamb chops under the fluorescent glare. The meat was raw, pink, threaded with white fat, but Rhys’s treacherous mind painted it all with the same brush. He saw the trays of steak, their dark, venous surfaces glistening under the plastic wrap, and his stomach turned. He could smell the iron tang of it, or perhaps he only imagined he could.

"Alright, Rhys, butt?" Gareth called out, wiping his hands on his striped apron. The apron was mostly white, but it bore the ghostly pinkish-brown stains of his trade. "Taking it easy today, are you? Heard you finished up at the Leek."

The news had already travelled. Of course it had. In Cwm Coch, gossip was the main local industry, more reliable than the slate and longer lasting than the herring. "Something like that," Rhys mumbled, his eyes fixed on a point somewhere over Gareth's shoulder. He couldn't look at the apron. He couldn't look at the meat. "Just... just some sausages, please, Gareth." Sausages were safe. Their contents were hidden, their colour a pale, non-threatening beige. As Gareth wrapped the links in waxy paper, Rhys saw Dafydd from the restaurant come into the aisle, a basket of groceries in his hand. Dafydd's smile was genuine, but it was tinged with an uncomfortable pity.

"Rhys! I was going to call you, mun," he said, his voice a little too loud in the quiet shop. "You okay? We were all worried. What happened, really? Davies is telling everyone you had a breakdown."

"I'm fine, Dafydd," Rhys said, the lie tasting like ash. "Just needed a change."

"A change? Man, you were The Gilded Leek. It's not the same. It's all… wobbly without you," Dafydd said, lowering his voice. "Look, if you need anything, a sub, you know... We're all on your side. Davies was a git about it." He clapped Rhys on the arm, a gesture of solidarity that just made Rhys feel more isolated than ever. He was a project now. A cause for concern. The man who saw a boggart. He paid for his sausages and potatoes, avoiding Gareth's curious gaze, and practically fled the shop, his basket of safe, colourless food feeling like a pathetic trophy. He didn't want their pity. He wanted the world to stop screaming at him.

He spent the next two days in his flat, a voluntary hermit. He ate boiled potatoes and fried sausages until the thought of them made him nauseous. He read books, deliberately choosing ones with plain, dark covers. He tried to watch television, but a car advert featuring a gleaming red sports car sent him scrambling for the remote, his heart hammering. He was living in a shrinking world, a world bleached of one of its primary colours, and the effort of policing his own senses was utterly exhausting. The rational part of his mind, the part that had uncorked a thousand bottles of Merlot without a tremor, screamed that this was insane. It was just a colour. But the terror was not rational. It was ancient and absolute, a reptile coiled at the base of his brain.

On the third day, a Friday, he woke up knowing he couldn't go on like this. To live in fear of a tomato, to be defeated by a postbox, was not living. It was a slow suicide of the spirit. The library had given him history, but history was abstract. He needed something more. He needed the storyteller. He needed Mrs. Bevan. He didn't know what he would ask her. He had no plan. He only knew that the quiet, ordered world of her lecture hall was the last place he had felt even a glimmer of control, right before the Red Mine had swallowed him whole. He found her address in the thin local phonebook, a small terraced house on a street named after a long-dead Welsh poet. He walked there with the grim determination of a man marching to his own court-martial. He needed a verdict. He needed to know if he was mad, or if the ghost he'd seen was real. He stood before her neat, dark green door, her name painted on a small ceramic tile next to it. For a full minute, he just stood there, his hand hovering over the bell, the familiar, trapped bird of his panic beating its frantic rhythm against his ribs. Then, taking a deep, ragged breath, he pressed the button.## Chapter 3

The sound, when it came, was not the cheerful chime he had expected, but a harsh, mechanical buzz that seemed to vibrate in his teeth. It was the sound of a mechanism that had been waiting a long time to be used. In the silence that followed, Rhys’s own pulse became the loudest thing in the world. He had a wild impulse to turn and run, to melt back into the grey anonymity of the street, to pretend this desperate pilgrimage had never happened. But his feet, as they had been in the restaurant, were rooted to the spot, this time by a fragile shard of resolve. He had rung the bell. The act was done. He was committed. A moment later, he heard the scraping of a bolt and the door opened, not wide, but just enough for a head to appear in the gap. It was her.

Mrs. Bevan looked smaller in her own doorway, without the slight elevation of the community hall stage. She wore a thick, brown, woollen cardigan over a plain blouse, and her sharp eyes, magnified by her spectacles, took him in with an expression of neutral, unwavering assessment. She held a slim, open book in one hand, her finger marking her place. She recognised him instantly. "You're the man from the back row," she said, her voice the same crisp, dry instrument he remembered. "The ghost-seer."

Rhys swallowed, his mouth dry. "Mrs. Bevan. I'm sorry to bother you at home. My name is Rhys. I... I was hoping I could talk to you. About the lecture. About the Gwaith Goch." The words came out in a clumsy rush, and he felt a flush of shame at his own lack of composure. He was a supplicant, a petitioner at the door of a high priestess of facts, and he had forgotten his offering.

She considered him for another long moment, her gaze unblinking. Her eyes flicked from his pale, strained face down to his tightly clenched hands and back again. He expected to be dismissed, to be told that her time was her own, but instead, she simply nodded once, as if he were a complex but solvable equation she had decided to entertain. "Very well, Rhys," she said, and opened the door wider. "You had better come in. It looks like rain."

He stepped from the damp, grey street into another world entirely. If his flat was a void and The Gilded Leek a stage, Mrs. Bevan’s home was a forest. A forest of books. They lined every wall from floor to ceiling, not in neat, uniform rows, but in a chaotic, organic profusion. They were stacked on the floor, they colonised the surfaces of chairs, they rose in precarious towers on a vast oak table that dominated the small front room. The air smelled of them—of paper and ink and time—mingled with the faint, comforting aroma of brewed tea and wood polish. It was a room suffocating with knowledge, and for the first time in days, Rhys felt he could breathe. The colours here were all muted, the browns and creams of old paper, the dark greens and burgundies of worn bindings. It was a sanctuary of neutral tones.

"Tea?" she asked, gesturing vaguely towards a cluttered corner that presumably served as a kitchen.

"No, thank you," Rhys said, afraid that his shaking hands would betray him if he tried to hold a cup. He remained standing, feeling like a large, awkward animal that had wandered into a delicate ecosystem.

"Sit," she commanded, indicating the only chair not completely overwhelmed by books. It was a wingback, its fabric faded to a pale, indeterminate pattern. Rhys sat on the edge of it. Mrs. Bevan did not sit, but perched on the edge of her great oak table, the book still in her hand, her posture that of a bird of prey surveying its territory. "So," she began, getting straight to the point. "The Red Mine. What about it?"

Rhys struggled to arrange his thoughts into a coherent narrative. "You said... in the lecture... that the town is built on hardship. That its prosperity was paid for." He looked down at his hands, twisting in his lap. "That story you told at the end, about the stream running red. Is it true?"

"True?" Mrs. Bevan gave a small, dry chuckle. "What a large and difficult word, Rhys. It's a legend. Which is to say, it has been told for a very long time, and people have believed it. That gives it a certain kind of truth, doesn't it? A story doesn't have to be a fact to be real. Sometimes, a story is the only way to explain a feeling." She paused, her eyes sharp and penetrating. "What feeling are you trying to explain?"

The directness of the question disarmed him. The carefully constructed wall he had built around the event crumbled. "On Saturday night," he began, his voice barely a whisper, "I was working. I was a waiter, at The Gilded Leek. There was an accident. A man knocked a knife, it cut his wife's hand. Just a scratch. And she knocked over a glass of wine." He stopped, the memory seizing his throat.

"Go on," she prompted, her voice calm and even.

"It was the colour," he finally forced out, the confession tearing from him with physical force. "The red. The drop of blood on her hand, and the wine on the tablecloth. I saw them and... something broke. The whole world just... folded in on itself. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. I dropped a tray. I ran out. I lost my job. And now I see it everywhere. It's... it's hunting me." He finally looked up at her, his eyes pleading, expecting to see pity or disbelief. He was ready for her to tell him to see a doctor.

Instead, Mrs. Bevan simply nodded slowly, as if he had just confirmed a long-held theory. "I see," she said, her tone utterly devoid of surprise. "You did not see a boggart, then. You saw a memory. Just not your own." She slid off the table and walked over to one of the most densely packed shelves. Her thin fingers, surprisingly strong, moved with unerring certainty, pulling a slim, dark-blue volume from a tightly packed row. "You came here asking about history. About facts. But I don't think facts are what you need. You're not haunted by a geological deposit of iron ore, Rhys."

She brought the book over to him. It was old, the cover unmarked by any title, the blue fabric worn smooth at the corners. She held it out to him. "This is a collection of local accounts, put together by a parish vicar in the 1870s. It's not history. It's what he called 'the unquiet lore of the valley'. Anecdotes, superstitions, ghost stories. Things people knew in their bones, not in their heads." She tapped the cover. "There is a story in here about the Gwaith Goch. It’s not about the massacre of the princes. It's much later. It's about a miner, in the early days of the pit. A boy, really. His name was Ieuan. The story goes that he was caught in a small roof fall. Pinned, not crushed. His hand was trapped, and badly cut. He was alone, and his lamp was broken. He lay there in the dark for two days, watching his own blood welling up and mixing with the red, iron-rich water that seeped from the rock. He was listening to the drip, drip, drip in the dark."

Rhys stared at her, mesmerised and horrified. He could feel the cold stone, the suffocating blackness. He could hear the drip.

"They found him, alive," Mrs. Bevan continued, her voice a flat, steady narrative. "But his mind was gone. They brought him up into the light, but he never spoke another word. And from that day on, according to the vicar's account, he could not bear the sight of the colour red. A sunset, a woman's ribbon, the berries on a holly bush—it would send him into a screaming fit. They said he didn't see a colour. He saw the mine. He saw the dark. He was still trapped down there, you see."

She placed the book in Rhys's numb hands. It felt impossibly heavy. "A story doesn't have to be a fact to be real," she repeated softly. "Perhaps you are not going mad, Rhys. Perhaps you are just, for reasons I cannot explain, remembering Ieuan. Perhaps this town has memories longer than the people who live in it, and sometimes, they find a way to surface." She looked at him, and for the first time, he saw not a scholar, but something akin to a doctor, one who dealt not with ailments of the body, but with hauntings of the soul.

"Read it," she said. "Understand the story. It may not cure you. But it's better to know the name of the ghost that follows you than to run from a nameless shadow in the dark."

Rhys looked down at the book in his hands, then back up at her. The panic in his chest had not vanished, but it had changed. It was no longer a frantic, meaningless chaos. It had a name. It had a story. It had the shape of a boy trapped in the dark, listening to a steady, terrible dripping. He left Mrs. Bevan's house and walked back out into the grey afternoon, clutching the small, anonymous blue book to his chest like a shield. The world had not changed. The red postbox on the corner still loomed with menace. But he was no longer just a man afraid of a colour. He was a man with a ghost to meet.## Chapter 4

Rhys walked home through the muted streets of Cwm Coch, the small, blue book a solid weight against his chest. The book felt dense with more than just paper and ink; it felt like a stone taken from a deep, cold well. The town around him had not changed, but his relationship to it had been irrevocably altered. He was no longer a resident moving through a familiar landscape. He was a man walking over a shallow grave, privy to the whispers coming up through the soil. The grey slate roofs were no longer the skin of a fish, but the colour of ash. The moody sky was not a canvas for his thoughts, but a heavy lid on a town of buried memories.

In his flat, he did not immediately open the book. He placed it on the centre of his small kitchen table and stood looking at it, as if it were a piece of unexploded ordnance. He made himself a cup of tea, the familiar ritual a small, deliberate act of normalcy in a world that had become fundamentally strange. The steam rising from the mug, the warmth in his hands, these were the things of his former life, a life of simple, sensory facts. But the book on the table belonged to this new life. It was an artefact from the country of his fear, and he knew he could not hide from it any longer. He sat down, the tea untouched, and pulled the book towards him. The worn blue cover was cool and smooth beneath his fingertips. He opened it.

The vicar’s script was tight and spidery, the ink faded to a rusty brown, a colour that made Rhys’s breath catch for only a moment before he forced himself to focus. The book was not typeset, but a careful, handwritten transcription of local tales. He found the chapter titled ‘The Echoes of the Gwaith Goch’ and began to read. The language was of its time, formal and freighted with a solemn pity.

*It is recounted by those who worked the early seams,* the vicar had written, *that the Gwaith Goch claimed more than the bodies of men. It had a hunger for the spirit also. No case is more sorrowful than that of the boy Ieuan Rhys, a door-trapper of no more than twelve years, who in the autumn of 1868 met with a fate some called worse than death. A section of roof, weakened by the perpetual damp, gave way not in a great cataclysm but with a weary sigh, pinning the lad by his left arm in a narrow crawlspace. His lamp was extinguished in the fall, leaving him in a darkness absolute and profound, a blackness so total it was said to have weight and presence.*

Rhys paused, his own hand instinctively closing into a fist. He read on, his heart a slow, heavy drum against his ribs. The vicar described the boy’s initial hope of rescue, the shouting that became a whimper and then silence. He wrote of the sounds that became Ieuan’s only companions: the groaning of the timbers, the distant, muffled boom of blasting from another seam, and one sound above all others.

*There was a constant seeping from the rock face beside him, a weeping of the iron-hearted earth. This water, stained a deep and terrible red by the ore, dripped with a merciless regularity into a pool near his head. And from his own trapped hand, where the rock had torn the flesh to the bone, his own life’s blood wept also, a darker crimson against the pale skin. He lay there, caught between two tides of red, one from the ancient stone and one from his own young heart, with only the sound of that terrible, patient dripping to measure the passage of a time he could no longer see.*

He had to stop. He closed his eyes, and the image was there, perfect and complete. The utter blackness, the feeling of immense weight, the wet cold seeping into his bones. He could feel the throbbing pain in a phantom limb, and he could hear it. A steady, liquid metronome counting out the seconds in an eternity of darkness. The panic he felt was not the frantic, soaring terror of the restaurant. This was different. It was a cold, heavy, drowning dread. It was the absolute certainty of being forgotten, of being left to dissolve back into the earth. It was Ieuan’s panic, and it filled him completely.

He forced himself to finish the account. The vicar described the rescue, two days later, by a party searching for the source of a blockage. They found the boy conscious, his eyes wide and unseeing in the sudden glare of their lamps. He was physically alive, but, as one rescuer was quoted, "the boy we brought up was but a shell; his spirit had remained below, entombed with the darkness and the red." The account concluded with the sad, strange coda of Ieuan's life. He was taken in by the parish, but he never spoke again. He lived in a state of perpetual, silent terror, and the sight of anything red—a ribbon, a prayer book, the setting sun—would send him into a state of catatonic fear or a fit of wild, soundless screaming. He died of a fever before his twentieth birthday, his silence unbroken to the end.

Rhys gently closed the book. He felt hollowed out, scoured clean by the sheer force of the story. He stood up and walked to his window, looking out at the familiar hills. He was not mad. He was haunted. The revelation brought no comfort, only a strange and terrible clarity. The fear that had ambushed him, the invasion he had felt, was not a malfunction of his own mind. It was an echo. An echo of a boy’s terror, trapped in the dark a century and a half ago, that had somehow found a resonator in him. He did not understand how. He did not understand why. But he knew, with a certainty that went deeper than thought, that it was true. The weight on his shoulders had not lifted, but it had taken on a definite shape. It had a name, and a history.

He was no longer just a man running from a shadow. He was the custodian of a memory. And with that knowledge came the first flicker of something other than fear. It was a cold, grim sense of duty. He had to do more than hide from this. Hiding was an insult to the boy who couldn't run. He thought of Ieuan, his namesake—Ieuan Rhys—a coincidence so stark it felt like a signature. He had to follow the story to its source. He could not bring Ieuan up from the dark, but perhaps he could go and stand at the place where he was lost, and listen. He had to see the Gwaith Goch. The idea was terrifying. It was a deliberate decision to walk into the very heart of the thing that was destroying him. But it was also the only path that felt like it led anywhere at all. He would go tomorrow. He would stand on that wounded ground and face the ghost whose fear he now carried.The next morning dawned grey and undecided, the sky a wash of pale, watery light. Rhys woke not from a nightmare, but into one. The decision to visit the Gwaith Goch, which had felt so clear and necessary in the abstract clarity of the night, now seemed like a form of self-immolation. Every instinct screamed at him to stay within the four safe walls of his flat, to pull the covers over his head and wait for the world to stop. But the story of Ieuan Rhys had planted something deeper than fear in him; it was a seed of grim responsibility. He could not leave the boy alone in the dark any longer. He dressed not in his old uniform of service, but in the anonymous uniform of the hills: sturdy walking boots, old trousers, and a thick, dark wool jumper. He ate nothing. Hunger felt trivial, an indulgence he hadn't earned. He tucked the small blue book into his coat pocket, its solid shape a strange comfort, and stepped out into the morning.

He walked through the sleeping town, his boots echoing on the quiet streets. He passed the shuttered front of The Gilded Leek and felt a distant pang, not of regret, but of nostalgia for the man he had been, the man for whom a spilled drink was a simple inconvenience. The path began at the edge of the town, where the neat rows of terraced houses gave way to a rough track that snaked up the side of the valley. As he climbed, the sounds of Cwm Coch—a distant dog bark, the rumble of the first bus—faded behind him, replaced by the rush of the wind in the gorse and the lonely cry of a circling buzzard. The air grew colder, sharper, smelling of damp earth and bracken. He was leaving the human world behind and entering a different kingdom, one governed by older, slower laws.

The track was steep, and soon he was breathing heavily, the physical exertion a welcome distraction from the spiralling anxiety in his mind. He focused on the path, on the placement of his feet on the loose scree and slick, mossy stones. He was tracing a route trodden by generations of miners, their ghosts walking with him. He imagined them, grim-faced men and small, wiry boys, making this same journey in the pre-dawn dark, walking towards the maw of the earth that would swallow their daylight hours. He thought of Ieuan Rhys, a boy of twelve, his small legs pumping to keep up, carrying his lunch in a pail, his future an unseen weight upon his narrow shoulders. For him, this path led not to a reckoning, but to work. The thought was so profoundly sad that it momentarily eclipsed Rhys’s own fear.

After an hour of steady climbing, the landscape changed. The slopes became scarred and unnatural, great, tiered slag heaps that the earth had only partially reclaimed. Heather and tough, wiry grass grew over them in patches, a thin green skin over a black skeleton. Rusted metal littered the ground, ghostly artefacts of a dead industry: a snapped length of cable half-buried in the turf, the twisted wheel of a cart, a line of rotten railway sleepers leading to nowhere. He had arrived. The site of the Gwaith Goch was not a marked ruin. It was a melancholy silence on the hillside. The main adit was a deep, collapsed depression in the ground, a choked, grassy dimple where the earth had swallowed its own wound. The wind seemed to fall silent here, and the air was heavy with a feeling of immense, sorrowful stillness. Rhys stood on the edge of the depression, feeling a profound sense of trespass. He was an intruder in a place of great and lasting pain.

He began to search, his eyes scanning the landscape not for ruins, but for the one thing the stories insisted must still be here. He followed a gully that ran from the base of the collapsed entrance, a channel carved by decades of drainage. And then he saw it. It was not a river, not even a stream. It was a slow, sluggish trickle of water seeping from a fissure in the rock, collecting in shallow pools before staining the earth as it snaked its way down the hill. And it was red. Not the alarming, vivid red of blood or wine, but a deep, sullen, ochre-red. The colour of rust, of decay, of something bled out long ago. It stained the stones it passed over with a dark, permanent blush. It was the weeping of the iron-hearted earth, and seeing it, Rhys felt a jolt of recognition so powerful it almost buckled his knees. This was the source. This was the font of his haunting.

He stood frozen for a long time, his body caught in the same paralysis that had seized him in the restaurant. His heart hammered a frantic, terrified rhythm, and the world narrowed to that ugly, rust-coloured trickle. Every instinct screamed at him to turn, to flee back down the hill to the safety of the grey town. But then he thought of the story in the book. He pictured the absolute blackness of the mine, felt the suffocating weight of the rock, and heard the merciless, patient drip, drip, drip in the dark. He was not in a well-lit restaurant. He was here, under the open sky, in the daylight. He could see. He could move. He had a freedom that Ieuan had lost in an instant. To run would be the ultimate betrayal. Steeling himself, taking a breath that felt like swallowing shards of glass, he took a single, deliberate step towards the water.

He knelt on the damp, cold earth beside one of the shallow pools. The red water was still, its surface reflecting the bruised grey of the sky. He could see the fine, reddish silt settled at the bottom. His hands were shaking so violently he had to clench them into fists to control them. He looked at his own pale knuckles, then at the dark water. It was an act of will, an act of faith, an act of madness. He unfurled his right hand and slowly, with the agonizing slowness of a man lowering himself into a fire, he reached towards the pool. The air grew thick. The sound of the wind vanished. The only thing in the universe was his trembling hand and the surface of that terrible water. Then his fingertips broke the surface. The shock was not of horror, but of a profound, piercing cold. It was the cold of the deep earth, a cold that had never known the sun. He pushed his hand deeper until it was fully submerged.

He held it there, his heart hammering, waiting for the terror to consume him. But it did not. He felt the icy water, the fine, gritty sensation of the silt against his skin. He pulled his hand from the pool and held it up. It was coated in a thin, rusty film. Water the colour of old blood dripped from his fingertips onto the dark soil. He stared at his own hand, transfigured by the water of the Gwaith Goch, and he did not see a threat. He saw a story. He saw the unimaginable loneliness of a boy trapped in the dark. He saw pain, and fear, and a sorrow so vast it had stained the very earth. A single, hot tear tracked its way down his cheek. He opened his mouth, and a sound came out, a ragged whisper on the wind. "Ieuan."

Saying the name aloud broke the spell. The frantic bird in his chest did not fly away, but it settled, its wings folding. The screaming terror receded, leaving in its place a vast, hollow ache. It was empathy, pure and undiluted, a sorrow that was not his own but which he now felt completely. It was the weight of the boy's fear, the weight of his solitude. He lowered his hand and found a clearer patch of water further down the gully, rinsing the red silt away in a quiet, cleansing ritual. The act felt strangely final. He had not banished the ghost. He had acknowledged it. He had borne witness.

Slowly, stiffly, Rhys pushed himself to his feet. He felt a hundred years old. A profound exhaustion settled into his bones, the deep weariness that follows a long and terrible fever. He turned and looked down from the hillside. Cwm Coch lay cradled in the valley below, a cluster of grey roofs and smoking chimneys under the wide, indifferent sky. It looked small from up here, and fragile. He saw it now not as the stage for his mundane life or the landscape of his fear, but as a place that held stories, a place that remembered, even when its people forgot. He was a part of that memory now, a keeper of one of its saddest tales. He had walked up the hill a man haunted by a colour. He would walk down it a man who understood its name. He took one last look at the weeping earth of the Gwaith Goch, then turned his back on it and began the long journey home.The walk down from the Gwaith Goch was a descent in every sense of the word. The ascent had been a climb into the thin, sharp air of his fear, each step a struggle against the gravity of his own dread. The journey back was a slow surrender to weight, to the profound exhaustion that had settled deep in his marrow. His legs felt heavy, his boots scuffing the loose stones of the path with a weary rhythm. The wind, which had been a hostile voice on the way up, was now just wind, a cool and indifferent hand on his face. He saw the buzzard again, still circling on the thermals, but it was no longer an omen. It was just a bird, part of a world that was vast and complex and carried on with its business regardless of the sorrows it held. He was not healed, he knew. A wound that deep does not simply close. But it was his wound now, not an alien infection. The fear had been a screaming stranger in his head; the sorrow that remained was a quiet, familiar guest.

When he reached the edge of town, the familiar landmarks appeared like objects seen for the first time. He saw the red postbox on the corner, the one that had screamed at him just a few days ago. He braced himself for the jolt, for the sickening lurch in his gut. But it didn't come. He saw the cheerful, solid red of it, and his mind, instead of recoiling, simply supplied an image: a hand, his own hand, dripping with the cold, rust-coloured water of the hillside. The colour was no longer an attack. It was a connection, a single thread in a vast and tangled tapestry of memory. The postbox was a postbox. But it was also a memorial. He felt a quiet pang, a ghost of a pain that belonged to a boy a century dead, and then he walked on, his stride even and measured.

His route took him past the front of The Gilded Leek. The lunchtime service was in full swing. Through the large front window, he could see the familiar choreography of the dining room. He saw Dafydd glide between two tables, a bottle of wine in his hand, a professional smile fixed on his face. Rhys watched him, and felt a profound and tranquil distance, as if he were looking at a scene from a film about a life he had once known. There was no longing, no regret. The starched linen, the polished cutlery, the carefully managed ceremonies of hospitality—they belonged to a different man, a man who had not stood on a wounded hillside and dipped his hand in the earth’s tears. That Rhys was gone, as surely as Ieuan was. He had been a good waiter, a reliable machine, but the machine had been broken open, and something far more fragile and human had been found inside.

He did not go back to his flat. There was one last thing he had to do. He walked to the quiet street where Mrs. Bevan lived, the small blue book a solid presence in his coat pocket. This time, when he stood before the dark green door, there was no hesitation. He rang the bell, and the harsh buzz no longer felt like an alarm, but like a simple announcement. She answered almost immediately, as if she had been expecting him. She held the door open without a word and gestured for him to enter the forest of books. The same quiet and order enveloped him, but this time it did not feel like a sanctuary from the world, but rather its library, the place where all its chaotic stories were gathered and kept safe.

He stood before her in the centre of the room and held out the book. “Thank you,” he said. The words felt small, wholly inadequate for what she had given him. “I read the story.” Mrs. Bevan took the book from him, her thin fingers closing around it gently, as if welcoming home a friend. She looked at his face, her gaze as sharp and discerning as ever, and he knew she saw the change in him. The frantic terror was gone from his eyes, replaced by a deep, settled weariness. “And?” she asked, her voice soft. “I went up to the mine,” Rhys said, his own voice quiet and steady. “I saw the water. I think... I think I met him.” He didn't need to say the name. Mrs. Bevan gave a single, slow nod of understanding. “Some stories,” she said, placing the blue book back into its impossibly tight space on the shelf, “do not like to be left alone. They need a listener.” She looked back at him. “The trick is knowing the difference between listening and being consumed. It seems you have learned it.” There was nothing more to say. The transaction was complete. He had taken a story, and now he was giving back a silence that was no longer empty, but full of understanding.

Walking away from her house, the future was no longer a terrifying void, but simply an unknown landscape. The idea of serving medium-rare steaks and smiling at complaints about corked wine was not just impossible, it was absurd. He had been a custodian of small ceremonies, but now he felt a kinship with something larger, a custodianship of memory itself. He thought of the quiet stacks of the town library, of the dusty, forgotten artefacts in the back room of the small local museum. He thought of the careful, patient work of piecing together a life from parish records and faded photographs. The work of a historian. The work of a listener. It wasn't an ambition, not yet. It was just a quiet pull, a current he could feel guiding him towards a new and calmer shore. It was a life where the ghosts of Cwm Coch were not to be feared, but to be known.

Back in his flat, the silence that greeted him was peaceful. The late afternoon sun, the same sun that once caught the dust motes over the dessert trolley and turned them into a fleeting galaxy, now slanted through his own window, illuminating the small, quiet space. His eyes fell on the bin in the corner, where the crumpled ball of the butcher’s calendar was still visible. He walked over, retrieved it, and smoothed it out on the kitchen table. The bold red letters spelling ‘SUNDAY’ looked back at him. He felt the echo, the memory of the red water and the story of the boy in the dark. It was a pang of sorrow, a whisper of a pain that was now part of him. But it was only a whisper. The colour did not scream. It did not hunt. He looked at the word, then at his own hand, clean and pale, and for the first time since that terrible Saturday night, he felt a quiet sense of peace. The ghost of Ieuan Rhys was not gone, but he was no longer trapped in the screaming dark. He was here, in the quiet light of the afternoon, and Rhys was not afraid.## Chapter 5

The following morning, Rhys woke to a profound and unfamiliar silence. It was not the absence of noise, for the gulls were still crying over the harbour and he could hear the distant rumble of a lorry on the main road, but the absence of the frantic, internal static that had been his constant companion. The fear was gone. In its place, a quiet ache resided, a sorrow as deep and still as a pool of water in a lightless cavern. He got out of bed and went to the kitchen. For days, his world had been a carefully curated landscape of beiges and greys, a fearful retreat from one of the world's primary colours. Now, acting on a quiet impulse, he opened his cupboard and took out a jar of strawberry jam. He spooned a small amount onto a piece of toast, the glistening, ruby-coloured preserve catching the morning light. He watched it, waiting for the recoil, the hook in his throat. Nothing came but the sad, fleeting thought of a boy who could never again enjoy such a simple thing. The colour was no longer an assailant; it was an epitaph. He ate the toast slowly, deliberately. Each bite was a small, quiet act of reclamation.

Life, however, did not wait for epiphanies to pay the bills. The Gilded Leek, which had provided the rhythm and structure of his days, had also provided his income. He was adrift, and the practicalities of his new situation began to assert themselves with a mundane but undeniable force. Later that morning, he found himself standing outside the drab, pebble-dashed building that housed the town's Job Centre. It felt like a far greater failure than dropping a tray of coffees. Inside, the air was stale with anxiety and cheap disinfectant. He sat on a hard plastic chair, waiting for his name to be called, a man untethered from his own life story, surrounded by others in similar states of suspension. The experience was humbling, stripping away the last vestiges of his identity as Rhys, the master of small ceremonies. He was just another number, another claimant. Yet, as he filled out the forms under the buzzing fluorescent lights, he felt a strange sense of grounding. This, too, was real. This was the prose of life, as solid and unglamorous as the geology of the hills, a necessary counterpoint to the dark poetry of his haunting.

His real business, however, lay elsewhere. After the soul-crushing bureaucracy of the Job Centre, he walked to the town library with the feeling of a pilgrim approaching a shrine. The heavy oak door swung open on a world of hushed reverence. Mrs. Pritchard was at her post, a formidable dragon guarding a hoard of paper and print. She watched him over the top of her spectacles as he approached the desk, her expression unreadable. He felt like a schoolboy again, asking for something he wasn't sure he was allowed to have.
“Mrs. Pritchard,” he began, his voice softer than he intended. “I was wondering if you could help me. I want to learn how to research local families. Parish records, census data… that sort of thing. I don’t know where to begin.”

She finished stamping a return with a decisive thud before raising her eyes to meet his. She studied him for a long moment, and he had the distinct impression she was seeing more than just a newly unemployed waiter with a strange new hobby. She saw the exhaustion in his eyes, the new quiet that had settled over him. Whatever she saw, it seemed to satisfy some internal criteria. Without a word, she stood up and led him towards a small, neglected corner of the library where a pair of archaic-looking machines sat on a wide desk.
“Microfiche and microfilm,” she announced, patting one of the machines as if it were a stubborn but loyal old dog. “The census records for the county from 1841 to 1911. The parish registers for St. Tysilio’s are on film, but the ink is faded. You’ll need patience and good eyes. The machine is noisy and the focus drifts. Don’t force the handle.” It was not a warm welcome, but it was a practical one. It was a key. She showed him how to thread the stiff roll of film into the reader, her movements precise and economical. “What are you looking for?” she asked, her tone still neutral.
“A boy,” Rhys said simply. “A boy named Ieuan Rhys. He would have been born around 1856.”
Mrs. Pritchard’s hands stilled for a fraction of a second. “I see,” she said, and for the first time, her voice held a flicker of something other than professional duty. It was a guarded, knowing curiosity. She did not ask why. She simply straightened up and returned to her desk, leaving Rhys alone with the machine and the ghosts spooled on the transparent film.

He spent the rest of the day in that corner, lost in the past. The whirring of the machine, the constant, frustrating adjustment of the focus knob, the faint scent of warm dust from the lamp—it became his new world. He scrolled through a sea of names, a ghostly parade of slate quarrymen, mariners, farm labourers, and their wives and children, their entire existence condensed to a few spidery lines of copperplate script. It was painstaking, hypnotic work. This was a craft, he realised, just as waiting tables had been. It had its own rhythms, its own tools, its own quiet satisfaction. Here, the goal was not a smoothly executed service, but a single, elusive fact, a name plucked from the vast, silent ocean of the dead. He searched the 1861 census, his eyes aching from the strain of deciphering the faint, looping script. He scrolled past Davies and Evans, Jones and Williams, the familiar litany of Welsh surnames. And then he found it. The entry was faint, blurred at the edges, but unmistakable. Dwelling: 24, Collier’s Row. Rhys, Owen, Head, Married, Age 32, Coal Miner. Rhys, Mari, Wife, Married, Age 29. Rhys, Ieuan, Son, Age 5, Scholar.

Rhys stared at the illuminated text, his breath held tight in his chest. Scholar. A five-year-old boy, just starting his brief education before the darkness claimed him. The ghost that had tormented him, the formless terror, solidified into a small boy on a specific street, with a father who worked the same seams and a mother who waited for them both at home. He was real. He had a family. He was not just a story; he was a life, however tragically short. Rhys instinctively reached out and pressed his fingertips to the cool glass of the screen, a futile, heartfelt gesture of connection across the chasm of one hundred and fifty years. The name was no longer just a name. It was an identity, a tragedy, a responsibility. The boy in the dark had a home.

He left the library as the streetlights were beginning to flicker on, casting a pale, jaundiced glow on the wet pavements. He felt a new kind of exhaustion, not the soul-deep weariness of fear, but the satisfying ache that comes from a day of focused, meaningful work. As he turned onto the high street, he saw a familiar figure coming towards him. It was Dafydd, his shift at The Gilded Leek just finished, his tie loosened and his top button undone.
“Rhys! There you are, mun,” he called out, his usual cheerfulness slightly forced. “We were just talking about you. The new lad, Carwyn, he’s a disaster. Spilt a whole bottle of Chardonnay on Mrs. Hughes. You should have seen her face! Old Davies is tearing his hair out.” He grinned, then his expression softened into one of genuine concern. “Seriously, though, how are you? You look… different. Tired.”
“I’m alright, Dafydd,” Rhys said, and was surprised to find that it was true. “I’m just tired.”
“Look, I meant what I said. If you need a few quid to tide you over…” Dafydd started, fumbling for his wallet.
Rhys held up a hand, stopping him. “No, honestly. I’m fine. But thank you.” He saw the confusion and pity still lingering in his friend’s eyes. Dafydd existed in a world of spilled Chardonnay and angry customers, a world Rhys had so recently inhabited. Now, it felt a universe away. They stood for a moment in an awkward silence, two men who had shared a workplace and a rhythm, now on opposite sides of an invisible, uncrossable divide.
“Well,” Dafydd said finally, clapping him on the shoulder. “Take care of yourself, yeah? Don’t be a stranger.”
“You too,” Rhys replied, watching his friend walk away towards the warmth and light of the pub. He felt no envy, only a quiet sense of separation. He had been a stranger, even to himself. Now, he was beginning to find his way home. He turned and walked on through the gathering dusk, the name of a five-year-old scholar a quiet, constant presence in his mind.## Chapter 6

The library became Rhys’s new Gilded Leek. The quiet discipline of his former life found a new home amidst the silent stacks. He would arrive each morning as the doors opened, taking his seat at the noisy microfiche reader in the corner as if reporting for a shift. The rattling whir of the machine was the new hiss of the kitchen espresso maker, the slow scroll of the film the new parade of plates leaving the pass. His movements became practiced and economical once more, not in the uncorking of a bottle, but in the careful threading of a brittle film, his fingers learning the delicate tension of the spool, the precise touch needed to bring a blurred name into sharp, ghostly focus. He was, once again, the master of a small domain, but his new customers were the dead, and his service was the act of remembrance.

His days were spent sifting through the somber archives of the parish. After finding Ieuan in the 1861 census, a boy designated ‘Scholar’, he turned to the death registers. He spooled past the years, past the union disputes and the cholera outbreaks, past 1868, the year of the accident. He was now looking for the end of the story, the final, clinical fact. The screen flickered with a litany of Cwm Coch’s sorrows: quarrymen lost to falls, infants taken by fever, sailors lost at sea, their entries marked with a stark, brutal finality. He scrolled through 1870, 1871, 1872, the years of Ieuan’s silent suffering passing in a blur of names. Then, in the register for the late summer of 1875, he found him. The familiar copperplate script leaped out at him, stark and clear against the grainy background. *Rhys, Ieuan. Age: 19 years. Residence: 24, Collier’s Row.*

Rhys stopped cranking the handle, his hand resting on the machine. He leaned closer to the screen, his breath fogging the cool glass for a moment. He read the final column, the one that offered the official, tidy explanation for the end of a life. *Cause of Death: Mania, followed by phrenitic exhaustion.* Mania. The word was a clinical dismissal, a sterile label slapped onto a terror so profound it had shattered a young mind. Phrenetic exhaustion. He imagined the boy’s body finally giving out, worn down not by a fever of the blood, but by a seven-year fever of the soul, a relentless, waking nightmare from which death was the only escape. The official record was a lie of omission, a neat closing of the books on a horror it could not begin to comprehend. Rhys felt a surge of cold, quiet anger on the boy’s behalf. He had been found, he had been named, and now he had been officially forgotten, his unspeakable trauma reduced to a quaint medical term.

With the date of death confirmed, the address became the next locus for his obsession. 24, Collier’s Row. It was a solid place, a dot on a map, the vessel that had contained the family’s grief. He needed to find it, to stand on the ground where they had lived and where Ieuan had finally died. He approached Mrs. Pritchard’s desk later that day, no longer a hesitant supplicant but a man with a specific, technical query. “Mrs. Pritchard, do you have any old survey maps of the town? From before the nineteen-sixties? I’m looking for a street that doesn’t exist anymore. Collier’s Row.” She looked at him with that same discerning gaze, but now there was a hint of professional respect in it. He was no longer a curious amateur; he was doing the work. She led him to a large, flat-drawered cabinet in a back office and, with a grunt of effort, pulled out a vast, rolled-up map of Cwm Coch, dated 1905.

They spread the brittle, yellowed paper across a large table, its surface a web of faded ink. The town of a century ago was smaller, leaner, clinging more tightly to the curve of the river. Together, they traced the old streets with their fingers. There it was. A tight, narrow street of terraced houses running parallel to the now-vanished railway line that had served the Gwaith Goch. It was exactly where you would expect miners to live, in the shadow of the industry that both sustained and consumed them. “It’s gone now,” Mrs. Pritchard said, her voice matter-of-fact. “All of this was demolished in ‘66. Made way for the Bryn Heulog estate. Progress, they called it.” She tapped a blunt finger on the new, neat grid of streets that had been superimposed in pencil on the old map. The past had been erased, paved over with tarmac and planted with neat little gardens.

That afternoon, Rhys walked to Bryn Heulog. It was a world away from the soot-stained vision of Collier’s Row in his mind. The estate was a collection of neat, identical semi-detached houses with tidy lawns and brightly-coloured children’s toys scattered about. It was the epitome of quiet, modern domesticity. Using the old map as a mental guide, he paced out the location. He found the spot where the old row of cottages would have stood. The site of number 24 was now a small, communal green, a featureless patch of grass between two houses, complete with a bench and a dog waste bin. Progress. Rhys stood on the grass, feeling the jarring dissonance of the two realities. Beneath the manicured lawn, beneath the foundations of this quiet estate, lay the ghosts of another life.

He closed his eyes and tried to listen past the sound of a distant lawnmower and the chatter of children playing. He imagined the small, dark cottage that once stood here. He pictured Owen Rhys, his face permanently ingrained with coal dust, returning from the pit, his body aching with fatigue. He saw Mari, her hands raw from laundry and cooking, her face etched with a constant, weary anxiety for the men she loved. And he saw Ieuan, the silent boy, sitting by the fire, his eyes wide and fixed on something no one else could see, flinching at the red glow of the embers. This small patch of grass had been the epicentre of their tragedy, the place where a family had slowly, quietly been torn apart by a grief that had no name and a fear that had no cure. He was standing on hollow ground, and he realised with a sinking heart that his search was not over. Finding Ieuan’s end had only raised a new, more profound question. What had become of the survivors? What had happened to the mother and father who had lost their son twice, once to the darkness of the mine, and again to the darkness in his mind? The single ghost he had set out to find had become a family, and their story was far from finished.The walk back from Bryn Heulog was different from the descent from the mine. That had been a slow release of terror; this was an intake of a new and heavier burden. The singular, sharp grief of Ieuan’s story had expanded to fill the shape of his family. Rhys was no longer just the keeper of a ghost’s memory, but the unofficial biographer of a forgotten household. The modern, cheerful face of the estate felt like a grotesque mask, and he felt an irrational anger at the neat lawns and freshly painted fences, at the sheer, unthinking ignorance of a present built directly on top of an unmourned past. His quest had shifted from finding an ending to finding the echoes that came after, and he knew, with a certainty that settled like lead in his stomach, that his work in the hushed archives of the town was far from over.

The next morning, the rattle and hum of the microfiche reader was the sound of renewed purpose. He was no longer searching for a single, tragic data point. He was tracking the quiet trajectory of a shared sorrow. The 1881 census was the key. It would be a snapshot of the family six years after Ieuan’s death, sixteen years after the accident that had stolen him from them. Rhys loaded the film for Cwm Coch, his hands steady, and began to scroll, his eyes scanning the familiar streets. He felt a grim anticipation, a sense that he was about to intrude on a scene of profound and private grief. He found Collier’s Row, its cramped dwellings catalogued with bureaucratic precision, and began to read down the list, his heart beating a slow, heavy rhythm. Rhys, Owen. Rhys, Mari. He found them.

The entry was brutal in its simplicity. 24, Collier’s Row. Rhys, Owen, Head, Married, Age 52, Coal Miner. Rhys, Mari, Wife, Married, Age 49. And that was all. The space below, where fifteen years earlier a five-year-old ‘Scholar’ had been listed, was now just a line, an empty void on the page that spoke with more eloquence than any history book. They were still there, in the same house, bound to the place where their son had withered away. Owen, now in his fifties, was still going down the mine, the same mine that had broken his family, his body bent to the relentless labour that was his only choice. Rhys stared at the screen, at the two names floating alone in the illuminated square. He saw them in the small, dark cottage, a man and a woman growing old in a house filled with the deafening silence of an absent child, their shared grief a third person living in the room with them. The sterile, official record became a portrait of endurance, a testament to the quiet, uncelebrated strength of people who had no choice but to carry on.

Buoyed by this grim discovery, he pushed forward, spooling the film ahead another decade to the 1891 census. He wanted to know how long they had endured. He navigated back to the records for Cwm Coch, his eyes now expert at picking out the familiar street names from the blur of scrolling text. He found Collier’s Row and began his search, expecting to find them at number 24, their ages advanced by another ten years, still locked in their quiet existence. But they were not there. A new family, a Williams with a brood of young children, now occupied the cottage. Rhys felt a jolt of alarm, a researcher’s panic at a trail gone cold. He scrolled back and forth, re-reading the entire street, then the neighbouring ones. He expanded his search to the whole of Cwm Coch, meticulously scanning for the names Owen and Mari Rhys. They were gone. The town that had been their home and their prison no longer held them in its records.

The feeling was one of profound loss, as if he had been speaking to them and they had suddenly turned and walked away. The neat line of his research had snapped. Had they died in the intervening decade, their bodies finally succumbing to the long grief and hard labour? Or had they, after Owen was perhaps too old for the pit, finally found the strength to leave Cwm Coch, to escape the place that held so many painful ghosts? He didn't know, and the empty space they had left in the 1891 census was as vast and silent as the one in their own home. He sat back from the machine, the whirring of its fan suddenly loud in the quiet library. He had hit a wall. The simple path was gone, and he was left with a cold and lonely mystery.

He approached Mrs. Pritchard’s desk late that afternoon, not with a question about a machine, but with a problem of strategy. He felt like a detective reporting to his superior. "I've lost them," he said, without preamble. "Owen and Mari Rhys. They're in the '81 census, but they've vanished by '91. Not a trace of them in the town." Mrs. Pritchard listened, her chin resting on her steepled fingers, her expression one of intense concentration. She was no longer just a librarian; she was a consultant in the art of chasing ghosts. "People moved," she said, her voice a low murmur. "The railways made it easier. He might have found work in the Rhondda, or the ironworks in Merthyr. Or," she paused, "they died. A decade is a long time in a place like this."

Rhys had already thought of that. "I can search the death registers, year by year, but it's a slow process." Mrs. Pritchard nodded, a glint in her eye. "It is. But the census is only taken on one night. A burial is a more permanent record." She stood up, a signal that she was about to impart a higher level of knowledge. "The chapel records are different. St. Tysilio's cemetery was the only one in the valley until the 1890s. Everyone ended up there. The burial plot records are not indexed, not on film. They are in ledgers. In the church vestry." She looked at him, a challenge in her gaze. "The vicar is a fussy man. He doesn't like his archives being disturbed. But he is a great admirer of my raspberry jam." She gave a thin, almost imperceptible smile. "I believe I can arrange a visit for you. But you will have one afternoon, and you will not make a mess."## Chapter 7

True to her word, Mrs. Pritchard’s raspberry jam diplomacy proved ruthlessly effective. Two days later, a message was left for Rhys at the library desk. Reverend Morgan of St. Tysilio’s would grant him access to the vestry records on Thursday afternoon, between two and four o’clock. The strict time limit felt less like an inconvenience and more like a challenge, adding a sense of urgency to his quiet quest. On the appointed day, Rhys found himself walking not towards the familiar comfort of the library, but towards the ancient, brooding silhouette of the town's oldest church. The sky was a high, thin grey, and the air was cold and still. He felt a solemnity settle over him, a different kind of nervous energy than he had ever felt before. This was not about confronting his own fear, but about being granted a brief, privileged audience with the town’s collective memory of death.

St. Tysilio’s stood on a small rise overlooking the harbour, its stone walls weathered to the colour of a stormy sea, its squat tower a blunt finger pointing at the indifferent sky. He passed through the lychgate, its slate roof thick with moss, and walked along the path, which was flanked by leaning, time-eaten gravestones. The names and dates on them were barely legible, erased by centuries of wind and rain. The church was not just a building; it was a testament to decay, a quiet monument to the slow, inevitable process of being forgotten. He was here to fight against that tide, to pull three names back from the encroaching silence, if only for a little while. The heavy oak door groaned as he pushed it open, and he stepped into a space that smelled of cold stone, decaying hymn books, and the faint, sweet scent of old beeswax.

A man in a dark, slightly frayed clerical shirt appeared from a side door, his expression one of polite but distinct suspicion. He was thin, with a pale, scholarly face and spectacles that seemed to perch precariously on a sharp nose. This was clearly Reverend Morgan.
"Mr. Rhys? I am the vicar," he said, his voice as dry as old paper. "Mrs. Bevan spoke of your interest in our town's social history." He said the words 'social history' as if they were a slightly distasteful euphemism for gravedigging. "She is a most persuasive woman. And her jam is, admittedly, superlative." He gestured towards a heavy, nail-studded door. "The vestry. The ledgers are on the bottom shelf. They are fragile and, I must stress, irreplaceable. Please handle them with the utmost care. I will be back to lock up at four o'clock precisely." With that, he turned and disappeared, leaving Rhys with the distinct impression of a man who had reluctantly handed over the keys to a sacred vault.

The vestry was even colder than the main body of the church, a small, stone-floored room with a single, high window of thick, bubbled glass that admitted only a weak, grey light. Against one wall was a set of deep wooden shelves, and on the lowest one sat a row of immense, forbidding books. They were bound in dark, cracked leather, their spines bare of any title, their sheer size and weight speaking of their importance. Rhys approached them with a reverence he had not known he possessed. He ran a hand over the cool, dry surface of one of the volumes. This was it. The final register. He heaved the first ledger, covering the 1880s, onto a small wooden table, the thud of its weight echoing in the tiny room. Opening it felt like opening a tomb. The pages were thick as card, the entries made in a variety of hands, some neat and precise, others a near-illegible scrawl, all recording the grim, final business of the parish.

He began his work, the silence of the vestry broken only by the rustle of the heavy, turning pages and the distant cry of a gull. He started in January of 1881, scanning the columns of names, ages, and causes of death. The litany of Victorian mortality passed before his eyes: consumption, bronchitis, dropsy, childbirth, diphtheria. He saw the names of families he recognised from the census, their stories ending here in a brief, stark entry. The pressure of the two-hour time limit was a physical weight on his shoulders, forcing a pace that felt disrespectful to the lives he was scanning. He moved through 1882, 1883, 1884. His eyes ached from the strain, his fingers grew dusty from the ancient paper. He was halfway through the ledger, the year 1886, when his breath caught in his throat. The name was there, written in a clear, decisive hand. *Rhys, Owen. Age: 57. Residence: 24, Collier’s Row.*

Rhys leaned forward, his fingers tracing the air just above the entry, not daring to touch the ink. Owen. He had died here, in Cwm Coch, just five years after the last census had found him. Rhys’s eyes moved to the final column, his heart pounding. *Cause of Death: Phthisis Pneumonales.* The miner’s friend. The slow, suffocating solidification of the lungs from a lifetime of breathing coal dust. Owen hadn't escaped the mine after all; he had carried it inside him, and it had finally taken him. The image was devastatingly clear: the man who had lost his son to the mine’s violence had been slowly, quietly killed by its dust. Rhys sat back, a profound and weary sadness washing over him. He had found Owen, not in a new town with a new life, but here, in the cold ground of St. Tysilio's, his life's long, hard labour finally concluded.

This grim discovery gave his search a new, desperate focus. He now had to find Mari. Logically, she would be near her husband, both in life and in death. He turned the pages more quickly now, his eyes scanning for her name in the months and years that followed Owen’s passing. He completed the ledger for the 1880s. Nothing. He heaved the next vast volume, for the 1890s, onto the table and began again. He searched through 1891, the year of the census that had erased her, and then onwards. He passed the date of the Gwaith Goch’s final closure, he saw the names of men he knew from history books, he watched the town’s story unfold one death at a time, but he did not find her. He searched the entire decade, his initial focus turning to a frantic, disbelieving hunt. It wasn’t possible. An elderly widow, alone, where else would she go? Where else could she be?

He reached the end of the second ledger, the year 1899 turning to 1900, with a growing sense of bewilderment. Mari Rhys was not here. Owen was buried alone in the churchyard, his wife’s name absent from the rolls of the dead for at least fifteen years after his passing. The implications of this absence were staggering. It meant that Mari, at nearly sixty years of age, having lost her son and then her husband, had not simply faded away in the town that held all her sorrows. She had left. After a lifetime in Cwm Coch, a lifetime defined by the Gwaith Goch and the grief it had wrought, she had packed her few belongings and walked away.

The vestry door creaked open, and Reverend Morgan stood there, silhouetted against the fading light from the church. "Four o'clock, Mr. Rhys." Rhys looked up from the page, his mind still reeling. He carefully closed the heavy ledger and placed it back on the shelf, his movements slow and deliberate. He had solved one mystery only to uncover a second, far more poignant one. He had come looking for an end, but he had found a beginning. He thanked the vicar, his voice distant, and walked out of the cold, silent church into the gathering dusk. He stood for a moment in the graveyard, the grey stones like a fleet of ships moored in the twilight. Owen was here, beneath his feet, another miner reclaimed by the Welsh earth. But Mari was not. She had become a new kind of ghost, not one tied to the haunted ground of Cwm Coch, but a ghost of the open road, a final, heartbreaking question mark at the end of a tragic story. His quest had a new, seemingly impossible destination: to find the place where a grieving widow had gone to live out the last of her days, alone.The walk back from the churchyard was a descent into a deeper mystery. The weight of the old ledgers seemed to have settled in Rhys’s own bones, a palpable heaviness of accumulated sorrows. The discovery of Owen’s end, grim as it was, had been a comfort of a kind, a neat closing of a chapter. But the discovery of Mari’s absence was a door blown wide open, letting in a cold wind from a vast and unknown landscape. He walked through the familiar streets of Cwm Coch, the lights of the houses warm and inviting, but his mind was elsewhere, picturing a woman in her late fifties, dressed in widow’s black, packing a small bag in the cold silence of 24, Collier’s Row. Where did she go? The question was a constant, low hum beneath his thoughts, a new ghost to accompany the old.

This was no longer a story of victimhood. Ieuan had been a victim of the mine’s sudden violence, Owen of its slow poison. But Mari, in leaving, had refused to be defined by the place that had taken everything from her. She had performed an act of profound, desperate agency. She had chosen to walk away from her ghosts. And Rhys, who had spent the last weeks learning to face his own, felt a surge of fierce, protective admiration for her. He was no longer just chasing a memory; he was tracking an escape. The thought gave his own aimless existence a sudden, sharp focus. He was not just looking for a grave; he was looking for a life.

The next morning, the library felt less like a sanctuary and more like a command centre. The hum of the microfiche reader was a familiar comfort, but he knew its secrets were limited. He laid out the facts for Mrs. Pritchard as she sipped her morning tea from a thick ceramic mug, the steam clouding her glasses. "Owen died in '86. Phthisis. He's buried at St. Tysilio's," he reported, the words sounding like a field agent’s debriefing. "But Mari isn't in the burial records. Not in the '80s, not in the '90s. She's gone."

Mrs. Pritchard set her mug down with a soft click, her gaze sharp and analytical. "So she ran," she stated, her voice holding a note of quiet satisfaction, as if confirming a winning move in a long chess game. "Good for her. But running leaves tracks, even then. A lone widow doesn't just vanish into thin air. She goes where she has support. She goes to family. Her own family." She peered at him over her spectacles. "You’ve been looking for Mrs. Rhys. You need to start looking for Miss… whatever-her-name-was."

The solution was so logical, so obvious, that Rhys felt a flush of foolishness for not having seen it himself. "Her maiden name," he said, the words a quiet revelation. "The marriage certificate."

"Precisely," she said, a rare, thin smile touching her lips. "The civil registration indexes. They’re on fiche, over there." She gestured towards a different cabinet. "General Register Office. You’ll be looking for marriages in the Cardigan registration district, probably around 1855, the year before Ieuan was born. It will be tedious. There will be a dozen Owen Rhyses. But only one of them will be married to a Mari. Find the reference number, order the certificate from the government. It will take weeks." She paused, taking another sip of tea, a twinkle in her eye. "Or," she continued, "Reverend Morgan owes me another jar of jam for his Harvest Festival fete. I suspect the church's own marriage register, if you are very careful, might prove a more immediate line of inquiry."

The following afternoon, Rhys was back in the cold, silent vestry of St. Tysilio’s, the scent of stone and decay welcoming him like an old acquaintance. This time, Reverend Morgan’s suspicion had been tempered with a grudging respect. He simply pointed to a different shelf, where smaller, slimmer ledgers were kept, and retreated, trusting in the power of future raspberry jam. The marriage register was less forbidding than the book of deaths. The entries were smaller, the mood of the ink somehow lighter, speaking of beginnings rather than endings. Rhys began in 1857 and worked his way backwards, scanning the pairings, the hopeful unions of a generation that had no idea what the coming decades of industry and hardship would bring.

It took him less than an hour. On a page for the spring of 1855, he found it. The script was elegant, celebratory. *Owen Rhys, bachelor, age 26, Coal Miner, of this parish. And Mari Powell, spinster, age 23.* Powell. Her name was Mari Powell. The feeling was one of triumph, a bright spark in the dusty gloom. He had found her other self, the young woman she was before she became a wife and mother, before grief became the defining feature of her life. He read the rest of the entry, his eyes scanning for the details that would build her story. Father’s name: Dafydd Powell, Farmer. But it was the next entry that made him stop, that made the entire search pivot on its axis. Mari’s residence at the time of her marriage was not listed as ‘of this parish’. It was listed as Aberaeron, a coastal town a day's walk to the north.

She wasn't from Cwm Coch. She had come here for her marriage, for her husband, leaving her own home behind. The implications hit Rhys with the force of a physical blow. Of course. When Owen died, when her last tie to the coal-stained world of Cwm Coch was severed, where else would she go but home? She hadn't vanished into the ether. She had simply reversed the journey she had made as a young woman in love, trading the black dust of the hills for the salt spray of the coast. She had gone back to the sea. The thought was so clear, so poetically right, that he felt a certainty that went beyond evidence. He closed the ledger with a soft, final thud. His time in the cold archives was over. His research could no longer be conducted from a chair. The next set of records he needed to check, the next ghost he needed to find, was in a different town, in a different library, in a place he now had to go. He had to follow her. The journey out of Cwm Coch was no longer just Mari’s. It was his, too.## Chapter 8

The decision, once made, settled in him with the quiet weight of inevitability. He was going to Aberaeron. The thought was both terrifying and liberating. For weeks, his world had been the claustrophobic triangle between his flat, the library, and the ghost-haunted hills. Now, it was about to expand, to break open towards the vast, unknown horizon of the coast. The journey was no longer an abstract idea but a practical problem to be solved. He checked his meagre funds, the last of his pay from The Gilded Leek and the first small giro from the Job Centre, and calculated that he could afford a cheap room in a boarding house for a few nights, if he was careful. He looked up the bus schedule, a flimsy piece of paper that became a map to a new world. The route was not direct; it involved a change in a small, forgotten market town, a slow, meandering path that seemed appropriate for the journey he was undertaking. He was not a tourist embarking on a holiday; he was a man following the cold trail of a hundred-year-old grief.

Before he left, he knew he had to see Mrs. Pritchard. It felt like a necessary piece of ceremony, a quiet acknowledgement of her role as the unwilling catalyst for his strange pilgrimage. He found her at her desk, presiding over the library’s morning hush, a bastion of order in a chaotic world. He placed the heavy church ledger he’d borrowed on her desk, its leather cover smooth and cool beneath his hand.
“I found her maiden name,” he said, his voice low. “Powell. And her home. She was from Aberaeron.”
Mrs. Pritchard did not look surprised. She looked as if she had been expecting this outcome all along. She peered at him over her glasses, her eyes assessing the new resolve in his face, the way the exhaustion had settled into a kind of focused purpose. “So you’re going, then.” It was not a question.
“Yes,” Rhys confirmed. “I have to see where she went. I have to finish the story.”
She nodded slowly, her gaze drifting towards the window, towards the grey hills that cradled the town. “Be careful, Rhys,” she said, and her voice was softer than he had ever heard it. “You have learned to listen to the ghosts of this valley. The ghosts of the sea are different. They are wider, and they have longer memories.” She turned back to him, her expression shifting back to one of crisp, librarian efficiency. “The library in Aberaeron is on the main square. It is smaller than this one, but the county archivist, a Mr. Wyn Jones, visits on a Friday. He knows the coastal families better than they know themselves. Tell him Elspeth Pritchard sent you. He may grumble, but he will help.” She had given him a key, a contact, a blessing. It was more than he could have hoped for.

The journey itself was a slow, rattling exorcism. The bus wheezed its way out of the Cwm Coch valley, and as it climbed, Rhys watched his hometown shrink in the window behind him. He saw the dark scar of the Gwaith Goch on the hillside, a place that had been the heart of his terror and was now a landmark in his own personal history. He saw the squat tower of St. Tysilio’s, the spire of the chapel, the slate roofs glistening in the thin, watery sunlight. He was leaving it all behind, and the feeling was one of profound, aching relief. As the bus crested the ridge and began its descent into the next valley, the landscape began to change. The stark, dramatic angles of the quarry country softened into rolling green hills dotted with sheep, the fields bordered by ancient stone walls. The tight, enclosed world of the valley opened up, and with every mile, Rhys felt the claustrophobic weight on his chest begin to ease. The sky seemed to grow larger, wider, a vast canvas of pale blue and shifting white clouds.

He changed buses in a sleepy market town, the brief stopover a strange limbo between two worlds. The second bus was smaller, older, and smelled faintly of diesel and damp wool. It trundled along narrow country lanes, past isolated farmhouses and through tiny hamlets where time seemed to have stopped. And then, he smelled it. A subtle shift in the air, a clean, sharp, saline tang that cut through the scent of the countryside. Salt. A few miles later, the bus rounded a sharp bend, and the world fell away. There it was. The sea. It was not the calm, picturesque blue of a postcard. It was a vast, churning expanse of steel-grey water under a silver sky, stretching out to a horizon that was lost in mist. The sheer, breathtaking scale of it silenced him. After a life lived in the cupped hands of the valleys, the endless, rhythmic movement of the ocean felt like a revelation, a force of nature so immense it made the sorrows of men seem small and temporary.

His arrival in Aberaeron was like stepping into a watercolour painting. After the monochrome palette of Cwm Coch, the town was a gentle explosion of colour. A perfect Georgian square of brightly painted houses—soft pinks, pale blues, lemon yellows—faced the harbour, their elegant facades looking out to sea. The air was filled with the sound of crying gulls and the rhythmic clinking of halyards against the masts of the small boats moored in the harbour. It was a town defined not by what was taken from the earth, but by what was taken from the sea. Rhys walked through the streets in a kind of daze, a stranger in a strange and beautiful land. He found a small, unassuming guesthouse on a back street, its sign creaking in the sea breeze, and took a room for three nights. The room was small and simple, but from its window, he could see a sliver of the grey, restless water.

That evening, as the light began to fade, he was drawn irresistibly to the harbour. He walked along the stone sea wall, the wind whipping his hair and bringing the sharp, clean scent of the ocean deep into his lungs. The tide was coming in, the waves crashing against the wall with a steady, percussive roar that seemed to vibrate through the soles of his feet. He looked out at the vast, darkening expanse, the same sea that Mari Powell would have known as a girl. This was her landscape, the backdrop to her childhood, the thing she had returned to after her life in the valley had been stripped bare. He tried to imagine her, a widow in black, standing on this very spot, her face turned to the wind, feeling the salt spray on her skin. Had she found peace here, in the relentless, cleansing roar of the waves? Or had she simply exchanged one form of haunting for another? Standing there, with the immense, indifferent ocean before him and a new town of strangers at his back, Rhys felt the full weight of his task settle upon him. He was at the beginning of another story, and he knew, with a quiet certainty, that the ghosts of the sea were waiting for him.The day before his appointment with the archivist was a strange and empty expanse of time that Rhys felt compelled to fill. He couldn't simply sit in his small room and wait. To do so would feel like a return to the paralysis that had gripped him in Cwm Coch. Instead, he walked. He left the guesthouse and let the town guide him, his feet taking him along the curved harbour wall, past the colourful houses that looked like a row of sugared almonds, and down onto the wide, steep bank of shingle that served as a beach. The sheer otherness of the place was a balm. The air, thick with salt, scoured his lungs clean. The constant, rhythmic roar of the waves washing over the stones was a sound so vast and elemental it seemed to absorb all other noise, leaving a space of profound, resonant quiet in his mind.

He spent hours on that shingle bank, watching the tide retreat to reveal a slick, dark sand ribbed with patterns like the skin of some immense sea creature. He saw the fishing boats chug out of the harbour, their engines a low thrum against the backdrop of the sea’s roar, and watched them shrink to small specks on the horizon. He thought of Mari. This beach, these boats, this immense, breathing body of water—this had been her world. The men of Cwm Coch went down, into the dark, suffocating earth, to wrestle a black and dusty living from the rock. The men here went out, onto the vast, open water, to pull a silver, glistening living from the depths. One was a world of enclosure and violent extraction, the other a world of open horizons and patient harvests. He began to understand, in a way that went deeper than thought, why she had come back. It was not just an escape; it was a return to a different way of being, a different relationship with the world.

On Friday morning, he found the library on the corner of the main square. It was a modest, single-story building, its large windows letting in a flood of bright, coastal light. Inside, it smelled of floor polish, old paper, and the faint, clean tang of salt that seemed to permeate everything in the town. It was a world away from the dusty, hallowed gloom of the archives he had grown accustomed to. A stout, balding man with a vast, drooping moustache and a tweed jacket that had seen better days was stamping books behind the counter. He looked up as Rhys approached, his eyes, magnified behind thick spectacles, holding a look of deep-seated, professional skepticism.
“Can I help you?” he asked, his voice a low, rumbling grumble that seemed to emanate from deep in his chest.
“I hope so,” Rhys said, feeling a familiar flicker of intimidation. “I’m looking for Mr. Wyn Jones.”
“You’ve found him,” the man grumbled, placing a book onto a trolley with a thud. “And I’m very busy.”
Rhys took a breath. “My name is Rhys. I’m researching a family history. Elspeth Pritchard, from the Cwm Coch library, suggested I speak to you.”

The effect of Mrs. Pritchard’s name was immediate and profound. Mr. Jones stopped his stamping, his head tilting to one side like a curious old badger. “Elspeth?” he said, the grumble softening into a note of grudging respect. “That old battleaxe is still holding the line, is she? Hmph. Said you were coming, did she?” He squinted at Rhys, his gaze sharp and appraising. “What family could possibly connect the black heart of the valleys with the coast?”
“A woman named Mari Rhys,” Rhys explained. “Before she was married, she was Mari Powell, of this town. She left Cwm Coch as a widow sometime after 1886. I’m trying to find out what became of her.”
Mr. Jones stroked his moustache, a thoughtful, calculating look on his face. “Powell. There are Powells in this county as common as pebbles on the beach. But a Powell who married a miner… that narrows it. Come on, then,” he grunted, turning and leading the way towards a door marked ‘Private’. “Don’t waste my time, and for goodness’ sake, don’t lean on the maps.”

The archive was a small, meticulously organized room, the air cool and dry. Ledgers and census books were stored not on open shelves but in clean, pale grey archival boxes. Mr. Jones moved with the unerring certainty of a man who knew the precise location of every soul in his paper kingdom. He first pulled the 1851 census, confirming the presence of Dafydd Powell, a tenant farmer with three daughters, the youngest of whom was Mari, age 12. Then, with a theatrical sigh, he produced the box for the 1891 census of Aberaeron. “The one she’s missing from in your valley,” he stated. “If she came home, this is where she’ll be.” He laid the heavy book on a table and began to turn the pages, his thick finger running down the columns of names with a speed that made Rhys’s head spin. He muttered to himself as he went, a running commentary of local gossip a century old. “Ah, there’s Evan the Post, drunk as usual… and the Davies sisters, still pretending they’re gentry…” Then his finger stopped, stabbing at a line halfway down a page. “Well, well. Elspeth was right to be interested. Look.”

Rhys leaned over the book, his heart thudding against his ribs. The script was faint but legible. The address was listed as 3, Fisherman’s Court. And the entry read: *Rhys, Mari. Head. Widow. Age: 60.* He had found her. She was alive, the head of her own household, no longer just an appendage to a husband or father. But it was the final column, the one for occupation, that made the breath catch in his throat. The single, carefully written word was: *Net-mender.* The word was a poem. It sang in the quiet, dusty room. Mending. After a life surrounded by the breaking of rock, the breaking of bodies, the breaking of a family, she had found a living in the quiet, patient, restorative work of mending what was broken. He imagined her hands, the same hands that had once washed coal dust from her husband’s clothes, now skilfully weaving a shuttle, knotting the broken threads of a fisherman’s net, her movements a quiet, repetitive prayer of repair.

He straightened up, feeling a dizzying sense of completion, of a circle finally closed. Mr. Jones was watching him, a shrewd, almost kindly look in his eyes. “Find what you were looking for, then?” he asked.
“Yes,” Rhys said, his voice thick with an emotion he couldn't name. “I think so. Fisherman’s Court… does it still exist?”
“Aye, it does,” the archivist said, closing the great book with a soft, final thud. “It’s a little alleyway of old cottages just behind the harbour. Number three is the last one on the left, the one with the blue door. Faces the sea.” He gave Rhys a long, searching look. “She’s been gone a long time, son. The ghosts of the sea, they don’t linger in the houses. They’re out there.” He nodded towards the window, towards the vast, bright expanse of the bay. “Go and see the house. But her story ended on the water.”
Rhys thanked him, his mind reeling with the new information. He stepped out of the library’s quiet gloom and back into the bright, windswept afternoon. He had her final address. He knew her work. The ghost he had chased from the dark heart of the valley had a home, a life, a purpose. He turned his face towards the harbour, the salt wind cool on his skin, and began to walk. His quest had a final, physical destination: a cottage with a blue door, facing the sea.The path to Fisherman’s Court was a journey of only a few hundred yards, but it felt to Rhys like the final, most significant leg of his pilgrimage. He walked away from the bright, open square and towards the working heart of the harbour, the smells of brine and diesel growing stronger, the cries of the gulls more insistent. The elegant facades of the guesthouses and shops gave way to the rough, practical stone of the fishermen’s stores and workshops. He found the entrance to the court tucked between a pub, from which the faint sound of lunchtime chatter emerged, and a building whose walls were festooned with stacks of bright orange lobster pots, their netting stiff with dried salt.

The court itself was a narrow, cobbled alleyway, sheltered from the main force of the sea wind. It was a place of quiet, domestic industry. A line of washing, mostly thick, woollen jumpers and coarse cotton shirts, snapped and danced in the breeze. The air was thick with the smells of tarred rope, woodsmoke, and the faint, underlying scent of fish. This was not a place for tourists; it was a place for people whose lives were governed by the tides and the seasons. It was a world of profound, tactile reality, and it felt more authentic to Rhys than any place he had ever been. He walked slowly down the alley, his boots loud on the uneven cobbles, feeling like an intruder in this private, close-knit world.

He saw the cottage at the far end, just as the archivist had described. It was the last one on the left, its stone walls almost white with a thick crust of salt and lime, its slate roof the colour of a mussel shell. And there was the door. It was painted a vibrant, defiant shade of blue, the colour of a summer sky reflected in a deep rock pool. Unlike the other cottages, whose doors and windows faced into the relative shelter of the court, this one was turned resolutely outwards, its front facing the low sea wall and the vast, open expanse of the bay. It was a house that did not hide from the sea, but engaged with it, lived in a constant, silent dialogue with the water and the sky. For a long moment, Rhys simply stood and looked at it, this humble, resilient outpost at the edge of the land. This was where she had made her stand. This was where she had learned to mend. He felt a deep and painful sense of trespass, but a stronger, more insistent sense of duty pushed him forward. He walked to the blue door, raised his hand, and after a moment’s hesitation, knocked.

The sound was small against the immense roar of the sea. He waited, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs, half hoping that no one would answer, that he could simply turn and leave, his pilgrimage complete. But after a moment, he heard the sound of a bolt being drawn, and the door opened a few inches. A woman’s face appeared in the gap. She was old, her face a beautiful, intricate map of a life lived by the sea, her skin weathered and tanned, her eyes a pale, faded blue, but sharp and intelligent. She looked at Rhys, a complete stranger in his dark, valley clothes, with an expression of polite, ingrained suspicion.

“Yes?” she said, her voice clear and strong, with the lilting accent of the coast.

Rhys’s carefully rehearsed words deserted him. “I… I’m sorry to disturb you,” he stammered, feeling clumsy and foolish. “My name is Rhys. I’m from Cwm Coch. I’m… I was looking for someone who used to live here. A long time ago. A woman named Mari Rhys.”

The woman’s expression did not soften, but a flicker of something new, a deep and ancient curiosity, entered her eyes. She studied his face, taking in his earnest, anxious expression. “Cwm Coch,” she said, the name sounding strange and foreign in the salt air. “The mining place. What would a man from the mines want with a ghost of this harbour?” She opened the door a little wider. “There are no Rhyses here now. My name is Elin Jones. This was my grandmother’s house.”

Rhys’s heart leaped. “Then you might have known of her? Mari?”

“I did not know her,” Elin said. “I was born long after she was gone. But my grandmother knew her. She spoke of her sometimes. The quiet woman from the valley. The net-mender. She said she was as much a part of this harbour as the tides.” She gave him a long, searching look, as if weighing his soul. “You have come a long way to ask about a dead woman. You had better come in out of the wind.”

She led him into a small, whitewashed room. It was sparse and scrupulously clean, furnished with a simple wooden table, two chairs, and a small, black stove. The room was dominated by a single, large window that looked directly out onto the grey, churning sea. The light that filled the space was bright and clear, a reflected glare from the water that seemed to scoured the very air. There were no ghosts here. There were no shadows. It was a place of elemental simplicity, a place where you could not hide from the sky or the sea. Rhys sat at the table, feeling the profound peace of the room settle over him.

Elin placed two mugs of tea on the table and sat opposite him, her weathered hands wrapped around the warmth of the cup. “My grandmother said that when Mari first came back to Aberaeron, she was like a shadow herself. A woman in black who spoke to no one, who just walked the shore from dawn till dusk. People were wary of her. She carried the sadness of the valleys with her, and that is a darkness the sea people do not understand. But she had to live. She had been a farmer’s daughter, so she knew how to work. She began mending the nets for the fishermen. Her stitches were small and perfect. She never broke a thread. She would sit on the harbour wall for hours, her hands always moving, her eyes always on the water.”

She paused, taking a sip of her tea, her gaze fixed on the horizon. “Slowly, she became part of the place. She never lost her sadness, my grandmother said. It was in her eyes until the very end. But she found a kind of peace in the work. In the mending. She was a good neighbour. She would leave fresh-baked bread on the doorsteps of families with new babies, or sit with the sick. She never spoke of her son, or her husband, or the place she had come from. Her past was a locked room. But her life here… her life was one of quiet kindness. She earned her place.”

“What happened to her?” Rhys asked, his voice a near-whisper. “How did her story end?”

Elin looked at him, and a small, gentle smile touched her lips. “It did not end in tragedy, if that is what you are afraid of. It ended in peace. She lived in this house for over thirty years. She saw the new century come in. She grew very old, as old as the sea-smoothed stones on the beach. And one morning, in the winter of 1922, the fisherman who brought her fish for mending his nets found her. She was sitting in that very chair you are in now, looking out of the window. A half-mended net was in her lap, the shuttle still in her hand. Her eyes were open. She had simply… stopped. My grandmother always said she had just gone back to the sea.” She looked out of the window, at the endless grey water. “Her only wish, which she had made known to the fishermen who had become her family, was that she not be buried in the earth. So they did as she asked. Her ashes were scattered from a fishing boat, out there, beyond the harbour mouth.”

Rhys sat in silence, the story washing over him, a final, cleansing tide. The woman who had lost her son and husband to the dark, suffocating earth had refused to be claimed by it herself. She had given herself back to the water, to the vast, open horizon. The cycle was complete. The story was finished. All the pain, all the fear, all the haunting that had begun with a single drop of red in a noisy restaurant had led him here, to this quiet, light-filled room, to this story of a peaceful end. He felt tears welling in his eyes, but they were not tears of sorrow or fear. They were tears of profound, quiet release. The ghosts of Cwm Coch had been laid to rest, not in the cold ground of the valley, but in the wide, free waters of the sea. He had finished the story. He had brought it home.## Chapter 9

He sat in the profound silence that followed Elin’s words, a silence filled only by the rhythmic crash and sigh of the waves outside the window. The story was complete, its final, peaceful note hanging in the bright, salt-scoured air of the cottage. He looked at Elin, at her wise, weathered face, and saw in her the living legacy of the community that had taken Mari in, a community that understood the quiet strength of endurance. There were no more questions to ask. The trail had not gone cold in a dusty ledger, but had dissolved into the vast, living memory of the sea. He finally found his voice, the words feeling small and inadequate in the face of the story’s immense, simple grace. “Thank you,” he said, his voice thick with unshed tears. “Thank you for telling me. It means more than I can say.” Elin simply nodded, her pale blue eyes holding a deep, compassionate understanding. “Some stories need to be carried,” she said, her voice gentle. “It seems this one chose you. Now you can set it down.”

He left the cottage with a blue door and walked back along the harbour wall one last time, but he was no longer a man searching for a ghost. The sea was not an abstract force anymore; it was Mari’s final resting place, a vast, unmarked grave that felt more like a liberation than a confinement. The wind that whipped off the water felt like a clean, final absolution. He had come to Aberaeron following a trail of sorrow, but he was leaving with a story of peace, a quiet, resilient peace earned through a long life of mending. He boarded the bus that afternoon, and as it pulled away from the brightly coloured square, he did not feel the wrench of leaving a sanctuary, but the calm resolve of a messenger returning with his news. The journey back was the inverse of his flight. He watched the landscape change in reverse, the open horizons of the coast slowly giving way to the soft, rolling hills, which in turn steepened into the dark, dramatic inclines of the mining valleys. But the closing-in of the hills no longer felt like a suffocation. He saw them now not as a prison, but as a vessel, a great, slate-grey bowl that held the stories of all the people who had lived and died within it. He was bringing the end of one of those stories home, a final, missing piece of the valley’s intricate, sorrowful puzzle.

When he stepped off the bus in Cwm Coch, the air felt heavy and still after the constant motion of the coast. The familiar scent of damp slate and coal smoke was no longer threatening, but simply familiar, the scent of a complicated and difficult home. He walked through the town, his boots echoing on the pavement, and saw it with new eyes. He passed the butcher’s shop and saw the raw, red meat in the window, and felt only a distant, academic pity for the man he had been, the man so terrified of a colour. It held no power over him now. The fear had been burned away, cauterized by a story that was larger and more powerful than his own fleeting panic. He found himself walking, not to his empty flat, but instinctively towards the library, the place where his journey had truly begun. It was late afternoon, and the lights were already on, casting a warm, welcoming glow into the gathering dusk.

Mrs. Pritchard was at her desk, surrounded by her customary fortress of books. She looked up as he entered, her expression betraying nothing, but he saw in her eyes a flicker of anticipation. He walked to the desk, feeling the familiar, worn floorboards beneath his feet, and stood before her, not as a student before a teacher, but as an equal who had completed a difficult and necessary task. He did not need to offer a preamble. She was waiting. “Her name was Elin Jones,” he began, his voice quiet but clear in the hushed library. “She was Mari’s granddaughter’s daughter. She lives in the same house. The one with the blue door.” He told her everything. He told her of Mari’s quiet, solitary return, her slow integration into the life of the harbour, and her decades of patient, restorative work mending the nets. He told her of the peace she had found, and of her final, quiet passing in a chair that looked out over the water. And he told her of the scattering of the ashes, her final release from the earth that had claimed her husband and her son.

As he spoke, he watched a slow change come over Mrs. Pritchard’s stern, guarded features. The professional curiosity softened into a deep, human compassion. She was no longer a gatekeeper of facts, but a woman listening to the resolution of a tragedy she had known only in fragments. When he finished, she was silent for a long time, her gaze distant. “So she flew free,” she said at last, her voice a low murmur. “After all of it, she flew free.” She finally looked at him, and her eyes, for the first time, were stripped of all their professional armour. They were simply the eyes of an old woman who understood the weight of the past. “You have done a good thing, Rhys. You have given a voice to the forgotten and brought a story to its proper end. Not many people have the patience for that anymore.” She paused, her gaze turning shrewd once more, but with a new warmth behind it. “The question is, what does a man who can listen to ghosts do, now that the ghosts are quiet?”

The question hung in the air between them, vast and full of possibility. Rhys looked around the quiet, ordered sanctuary of the library, at the shelves packed with stories waiting to be told, at the silent histories bound in leather and cloth. He thought of the painstaking work, the thrill of discovery, the deep, satisfying feeling of connecting a name to a life. It had been more than a distraction; it had become a vocation. The terror that had broken his life open had, in the end, revealed a new and unexpected path, one that led not through the polished floorboards of a dining room, but through the dusty, silent archives of the past. He was no longer a waiter. He was something else now, something he was only just beginning to understand. “I don’t know,” he said to Mrs. Pritchard, but the words were not an admission of defeat. They were the quiet, hopeful statement of a man standing at the beginning of a new chapter, his own story finally ready to be written.His answer, "I don’t know," was not an admission of emptiness, but of possibility. For the first time in his life, the future was not a set of rails leading to the next shift, the next table, the next predictable day. It was an open field, shrouded in mist, and the lack of a path was, for the first time, not a source of terror but of quiet anticipation. Mrs. Pritchard gave a small, almost imperceptible nod, as if his answer was the only one she would have accepted. She pushed a stray strand of grey hair back into place, her gesture crisp and decisive. "Well," she said, her tone shifting back to the practical. "Ignorance is a fine starting point. It's the only one that allows for discovery. But it doesn't pay the rent." She leaned forward slightly, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial murmur. "The museum has been without a proper curator for three years. They have a collection of artefacts in the back room that haven't been catalogued since the 1970s. And here," she gestured around the quiet, ordered library, "I have boxes of donated photographs and unindexed parish newsletters that are slowly turning to dust and silverfish food. The dead are very patient, Rhys, but their records are not. They rot. They fade. They need keepers." She didn't offer him a job. She offered him a purpose, a small, dusty corner of the world that needed tending.

He walked home through the deepening twilight, the streetlights haloed in the damp air. The town he had known his whole life felt different, layered. The familiar slate roofs and stone walls were no longer just a surface; they were the top layer of a deep and complex stratigraphy of human lives. He saw the warm, yellow light in the window of a terraced house and didn't just see a family watching television; he imagined the generations that had sat in that same room, the births and deaths it had witnessed, the quiet, unrecorded dramas it held within its walls. He felt an overwhelming sense of connection to the town, not as a performer on its stage, but as a student of its deep, hidden grammar. His focus had shifted from the fleeting, chaotic present to the vast, silent permanence of the past, and in that shift, he felt a profound sense of coming home.

Back in his flat, the silence that greeted him was not lonely, but peaceful and contemplative. There was one last ghost to lay to rest, the ghost of the man he had been. He went to his wardrobe and took out his old uniform. The white shirt, the black trousers, the tie, the waistcoat. He laid them out on his bed, a stark monochrome effigy of his former self. He ran his hand over the smooth, starched cotton of the shirt, remembering the rigid comfort of it, the professional armour it had provided. He recalled the practiced economy of his movements, the detached warmth of his smile, the whole, well-oiled machine of hospitality he had inhabited for so long. It felt like a costume from a play that had long since finished its run. With a sense of quiet ceremony, he folded each item neatly, not with the quick, efficient folds of a man in a hurry, but with the slow, deliberate care of someone packing away a precious, but finished, part of their life. He placed the folded uniform into a bag, not to be thrown away, but to be given away, passed on. It was a gentle, respectful letting go.

A new rhythm began to establish itself, a quiet cadence that replaced the frantic tempo of restaurant service. His weekly visit to the Job Centre was a brief, humbling ritual of paperwork and polite questions, a tether to the practical world of rent and bills. But the rest of his days belonged to the library. He became Mrs. Pritchard’s unofficial, unpaid apprentice, her silent acolyte in the war against decay and forgetfulness. His first task was a stack of cardboard boxes retrieved from the library's damp cellar, a donation from a house clearance years ago. They were filled with glass plate negatives and fading sepia photographs, mostly unlabeled studio portraits of stiffly-posed Victorian families, their faces staring out at him with a disconcerting, sepulchral intensity. His job, Mrs. Pritchard had told him with a glint in her eye, was to give them back their names.

It was painstaking, meticulous work, a craft that demanded a new kind of patience. He learned to handle the heavy, fragile glass plates with a surgeon’s care, holding them up to the light to see the ghostly faces emerge from the dark emulsion. He spent hours at the microfiche reader, cross-referencing the faces with his growing knowledge of the town’s family trees, hunting for a resemblance, a clue in the style of a dress or the backdrop of a studio. It was a vast, three-dimensional puzzle, and he found a deep, absorbing satisfaction in it. He was not just a researcher; he was a re-connector. When he successfully matched a photograph of a stern-faced woman in a jet-beaded dress to a name in the 1891 census, a Mary-Anne Jones, wife of a chapel deacon, he felt a jolt of triumph that was more profound than any satisfied customer’s compliment. He had plucked a life from anonymity. He was learning the faces of the dead, and in doing so, he was re-weaving the frayed threads of the town’s memory.

One evening, as he was leaving the library, his mind still occupied with the possible identity of a quarry foreman whose magnificent beard was his only distinguishing feature, he heard a familiar voice call his name. It was Dafydd, waving him over from the doorway of the pub across the street. A flicker of his old social anxiety stirred, but he pushed it down and walked over, the scent of stale beer and frying onions a sudden, jarring reminder of his old world. Dafydd greeted him with a warm, friendly clap on the shoulder. “There he is! The ghost of Cwm Coch! Come on, I’ll buy you a pint. You look like you could use one.” Rhys hesitated for a moment, then nodded, following his friend into the noisy, cheerful warmth of the pub. The conversation was a strange and dislocating experience. Dafydd, leaning over his pint, recounted the latest dramas from The Gilded Leek with animated relish: a new chef who was a "genius with fish but a terror with the staff," a disastrously timed power cut during a Saturday night service, old Mr. Davies’s latest tirade about the rising cost of linen. Rhys listened politely, nodding in the right places, but the stories felt like dispatches from a distant, foreign land. The names and the situations were familiar, but the urgency, the importance of it all, had evaporated completely. The world of medium-rare steaks and ruined digestions seemed impossibly small and frantic to him now. He felt a gentle, detached affection for his friend, still caught up in that whirlwind, but he had no desire to be drawn back into it. He finished his pint, made his excuses about an early start, and left Dafydd looking after him with a puzzled, slightly concerned expression. Rhys walked home under the stars, the noisy drama of the pub fading behind him, eager to get back to the quiet, patient company of his box of silent faces.## Chapter 10

The weeks turned into months, and Rhys’s life settled into a new, quiet rhythm, a gentle tide governed by the library’s opening hours and the slow, patient unearthing of the past. The frantic, percussive beat of his old life faded into a distant memory, replaced by the soft rustle of turning pages and the delicate click of glass on wood. He had become an excavator of faces. The boxes of glass plate negatives were his own private archaeological dig, and each face he managed to coax from the dark emulsion and match to a name in the census felt like a significant find, a shard of pottery that told the story of a whole civilization. He learned the subtle tells of the town’s past: the difference in posture between a quarryman and a shopkeeper, the cut of a dress that could place a photograph within a five-year window, the recurring facial features that mapped the town’s intertwined genealogies. He was becoming fluent in the silent language of the dead.

His focus had been on the formal studio portraits, the stiffly-posed families and solemn individuals staring into the lens as if confronting their own mortality. But one day, deep in a box of miscellaneous plates that had been damaged by damp, he found something different. It was a group photograph, taken outdoors, the light raw and unfiltered. The image was stark and powerful: a dozen or so men, their faces smudged with dirt, posed at the entrance to what could only be the Gwaith Goch. The collapsed depression he had stood before was, in this image, a dark, timber-framed maw. The men were miners, their expressions a mixture of grim exhaustion and weary pride. He recognised the type instantly, the faces of men like Owen Rhys. But one figure, standing slightly apart from the others, drew his eye. He was younger than most of the others, with a clean-shaven, thoughtful face that seemed at odds with the grime and the hard labour. And in his hands, held carefully against his chest, he was holding a book. It was not a Bible or a ledger, but a slim volume, its cover worn smooth. A book, held like a tool or a treasure, at the very entrance to the suffocating darkness of the pit.

Rhys felt a jolt of recognition, a kinship with this anonymous man. Here was another anomaly, another person whose inner life seemed to spill out beyond the rigid confines of their role. He spent two days trying to identify him, scouring the census records for a young miner who might also be listed as a scholar, a clerk, anything. But he found nothing. The man was a ghost even among the ghosts, his identity lost to the anonymous ranks of the mine’s workforce. He took the plate to Mrs. Pritchard, carefully placing it on a light-box on her desk. She peered at the illuminated image, her lips pursed in concentration. She recognised some of the older men from other photographs, naming them with a quiet authority. “That’s Idris Evans, he was a foreman. And that’s one of the Pugh brothers, lost his leg a year after this was taken. But him…” she tapped the glass above the man with the book. “I’ve never seen him. An intelligent face. He doesn’t look like he belongs there, does he?”

Her words echoed Rhys’s own thoughts. The man with the book became a quiet obsession, a mystery that the written record could not solve. The archives had given up all their secrets on the Rhys family, but this man remained stubbornly silent. Mrs. Pritchard, watching his mounting frustration, made a suggestion that filled him with a familiar dread. “The records are silent, Rhys. But the people may not be. There are still a few in this town who are older than any book in this library. Old Mr. Morgan at the post office. The Jenkins sisters up on the hill. Their memories are an archive of their own, and a much more disorganised one. But sometimes, they hold a story that was never written down. You should ask them.” The thought of taking his obscure historical query out into the living world, of approaching strangers and asking them to rummage through the attics of their minds, felt like a terrifying new kind of performance. He was comfortable with the dead; they did not judge. But the thought of the Jenkins sisters peering at him over their teacups filled him with a cold apprehension.

For a week, he put it off, burying himself in other, safer projects. But the face of the man with the book haunted him. He was a loose thread, and Rhys had become a man who could not abide loose threads. Finally, steeling himself, he made a high-quality print of the photograph and, armed with the image in a protective sleeve, began his new, intimidating task. He started with Mr. Morgan at the post office, a man so ancient he seemed to have become part of the building’s fixtures. The old man held the photograph close to his thick glasses, his hand trembling slightly, but he shook his head. “Miners,” he rasped. “They all looked the same, poor devils. Tired.” Rhys left, disheartened, and walked up the steep hill to the small, neat cottage where the Jenkins sisters lived. They invited him in, their initial suspicion giving way to a flutter of excitement at having a visitor. They passed the photograph between them, their wrinkled faces close together, their conversation a whispered duet of “Do you remember?” and “Wasn’t he related to…?” But again, nothing. They offered him tea and a slice of Bara brith, and he sat with them for an hour, listening to their stories of the town in the 1950s, feeling less like a researcher and more like a grandson on a dutiful visit.

He was beginning to think the quest was hopeless when, on his way back down the hill, he saw a solitary figure sitting on a bench overlooking the valley. It was Iestyn Roberts, a man well into his nineties, who had worked as a boy in the last days of the Gwaith Goch’s existence, before its final closure. Rhys had seen him around the town, a silent, stooped figure who rarely spoke. With a surge of what felt like his last reserves of courage, Rhys approached him. “Mr. Roberts? I’m sorry to bother you.” The old man looked up, his eyes a pale, watery blue, but surprisingly sharp. Rhys held out the photograph. Iestyn took it, his gnarled, arthritic fingers surprisingly gentle. He stared at it for a long, silent minute, his gaze sweeping over the faces. Rhys was about to give up when the old man’s finger came up and tapped the glass, right on the man with the book. “Llywelyn,” he breathed, the name a soft puff of air. “Llywelyn Y Llyfr. Llywelyn the Book.”

Rhys stared at him, his heart hammering. “You knew him?” Iestyn shook his head slowly. “Not me. He was before my time. Long before. But my grandfather, he worked with him. He told me the story.” The old man’s gaze grew distant, looking out over the valley but seeing something else entirely, a past that was more vivid than the present. “He wasn't strong, my grandfather said. He had a weakness in his chest. Couldn't do the heaviest work. But he was clever. He could read and write like a vicar. Most of the men couldn't, not a word. So that’s what he did. He was their scribe. A man would want to send a letter to his wife, or his sweetheart who was away in service. He’d find Llywelyn during a break, down in the dark, and tell him what he wanted to say. And Llywelyn, he would write it all down in that book of his. Later, he would copy it out onto proper paper. He wrote their love letters and their worries and their hopes. He carried all their secrets for them.” Iestyn looked down at the photograph again, a soft, sad smile touching his lips. “My grandfather said he was the most important man in the pit. He wasn't digging out the coal. He was digging out their hearts.”

Rhys walked back to the library in a daze, the old man’s story echoing in his mind. He had gone looking for a name and had been given a title, a role, a secret history of the mine that existed in no official record. Llywelyn the Book. The Scribe of the Gwaith Goch. Back in the library’s quiet solitude, he looked at the photograph again. The young man with the book was no longer an anomaly. He was the valley’s poet, its confessor, a keeper of hearts in a place designed to break them. Rhys carefully took a small card and, in his neatest hand, wrote: *Llywelyn ‘Y Llyfr’ (The Book). Unidentified Gwaith Goch miner, circa 1890. According to oral history, acted as scribe for the other miners.* He placed the card beside the photograph. He hadn't just put a name to a face. He had restored a soul to a story, adding a small, defiant flicker of humanity to the overwhelming darkness of the pit. He realised then that his work was not just about the dead. It was about connecting the past to the present, the paper record to the living voice. The thought of the museum, of a place where he could share these stories, where he could put Llywelyn’s picture on a wall with his story beside it for the whole town to see, no longer felt like a distant dream. It felt like a responsibility.The weeks turned into months, and Rhys’s life settled into a new, quiet rhythm, a gentle tide governed by the library’s opening hours and the slow, patient unearthing of the past.
