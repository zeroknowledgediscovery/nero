The sardine fat sizzled, a tiny, pungent explosion in the cast-iron pan. Pau watched the skin crisp and curl, his long, sallow fingers clutching the handle with a practiced ease. Above him, the world rumbled. It was the sound of Barcelona waking up, a low-frequency groan of metal shutters, delivery trucks, and the first shouted greetings of the day. For the denizens of the Mercat de la Boqueria, morning didn't start with the sun, which was still a pale suggestion over the Mediterranean, but with the clatter and roar of commerce. For Pau, tucked away in his sub-cellar warren carved out between a forgotten medieval cistern and the main sewer line, it was just noise. A familiar, ignorable symphony of the overworld.

He slid the two small sardines onto a chipped ceramic plate, a relic from the 1992 Olympics he’d found half-buried in the mud of a construction site. The image of Cobi, the surrealist sheepdog mascot, was faded to a ghost, but Pau liked the curve of its smile. He drizzled the fish with a squeeze of lemon, stolen from a crate two nights prior, and sat on his stool, a repurposed stack of petrified telephone directories. His home, if one could call it that, was a collage of the city’s detritus. Walls insulated with layers of newspaper and glossy magazines, their smiling human faces turning to a jaundiced yellow in the damp. Shelves made of old scaffolding planks held his treasures: a jar of mismatched buttons, a tangle of copper wire, a clock with a porcelain face cracked like a spider’s web, and dozens upon dozens of broken tiles—*trencadís*—in every shade of blue, green, and terracotta.

This was his life. A quiet, subterranean existence of observation and acquisition. He was a goblin, and a goblin’s purpose was to exist in the cracks, to thrive on the forgotten. Humanity, in all its loud, wasteful glory, was the perfect host organism. They discarded more than most species consumed in a lifetime. Pau was an artist of this waste. His magnum opus, a sprawling mosaic that covered the curved wall of the cistern, depicted the entire city of Barcelona as a great, sleeping beast made of glass and stone, its dreams rising like smoke from the chimneys of the Eixample. It was a secret history, told in fragments of what the humans threw away.

He ate slowly, methodically, picking the bones clean with his sharp nails. The taste of salt and sea was a comfort. It was predictable. Safe. Unlike the thing that had arrived an hour before dawn. It sat now on his workbench, a stark anomaly in his curated collection of decay. It was a bird. A mechanical songbird, no bigger than his fist, wrought from brass and silver filigree. Its eyes were tiny chips of sapphire, and when it had first flown into his hobo through a drainage grate, its wings had whirred with the impossible precision of a master watchmaker. It had landed, chirped a tune that sounded like a fractured Vivaldi, and then a tiny compartment had opened in its chest. A single, rolled piece of vellum, no bigger than his thumb, had dropped onto a pile of unsorted sea glass. Then the bird had gone still, its sapphire eyes vacant.

Pau had ignored it for a full hour. New things were dangerous. New things had owners. Owners who came looking. But the silence from the bird was more unsettling than its arrival. It was a challenge. A question mark sitting in the middle of his predictable life. He finished his last sardine, wiped the grease from his thin lips with the back of his hand, and finally crossed the small space. The air was thick with the smell of old stone, damp earth, and the faint, sweet perfume of rotting fruit from the market above. He picked up the vellum. It was impossibly smooth, and the ink was a deep, shimmering black that seemed to drink the light from his oil lamp.

The script was an elegant, archaic form of a language he hadn't seen written in centuries, a proto-goblin tongue used for high ceremony and ancient pacts. He could read it, just. His grandfather had insisted, beating the grammar into him with a leather strap. "The roots, Pau," the old goblin had rasped, his voice like grinding stones. "A tree without roots is just firewood."

*The Loom of Ages frays,* the script read. *The Weaver is compromised. A new hand is sought. Your thread is called. Seek the Font de Canaletes at the moon's zenith. Prove your worth. The Shadowed Hand guides.*

Pau read it three times. It was nonsense. High-minded, poetic nonsense. A prank. Who would play such a prank on a hermit goblin living under a market? Goblins didn't *do* things like this. They scavenged, they tinkered, they bickered over territory, they stayed hidden. They did not answer cryptic calls to adventure written in a dead language. The ‘Loom of Ages’ sounded like something a human would invent for one of their noisy, CGI-filled films. He snorted, a wet, guttural sound. ‘Prove your worth.’ His worth was proven every day he survived, unseen and unmolested, in the belly of a city of two million giants.

He looked at the mechanical bird. Its craftsmanship was exquisite. He ran a long, sharp fingernail over the seam of a wing. Perfect. Not even the finest Swiss watchmakers could achieve such a seamless join. This wasn't a prank. This was expensive. And expensive things meant powerful people. Or powerful Goblins. A far more terrifying prospect. There were rumors, of course. Whispers that passed through the hidden communities, carried by sewer rats and late-night cockroaches. Rumors of goblin clans in the high Pyrenees who had never bowed to the age of man, of covens in the deep places beneath Madrid who practiced the old magics, of a new movement that believed goblins were not meant to be scavengers, but inheritors.

Pau had always dismissed it. The fantasies of the disgruntled. Resentment was a cheap meal, and most goblins were starving. But this bird… this was not cheap. He crumpled the vellum in his fist. His first instinct, the one that had kept him alive for over a century, was to melt the bird down for its constituent parts. The brass would make excellent fittings for a new set of distillation pipes. The silver could be traded. The sapphires… the sapphires could buy him a decade's worth of black-market chorizo and the finest Manchego cheese. He could retreat even deeper, build a new warren far from any potential trouble.

But he didn't. He smoothed the vellum out again, his fingers tracing the elegant, confident strokes. *Your thread is called.* The words were a hook, snagging on a part of him he thought had atrophied long ago: curiosity. And beneath it, something else. A faint, bitter taste of pride. Why him? Pau de la Boqueria. The mosaic-maker. The finder of lost things. There were thousands of goblins in the Iberian peninsula. Goblins who were stronger, faster, more learned in the old ways. Goblins who were warriors, thieves, and spies. He was none of those things. He was an artist, a recluse. An expert in being overlooked. Perhaps that was the point.

He looked around his home. The sleeping city on the wall seemed to watch him, its glass-fragment eyes glittering in the lamplight. It was his city. He knew its secret arteries, its forgotten bones. He knew the whisper of the wind through the gargoyles of the Barri Gòtic, the taste of the sea-spray at Barceloneta, the particular shade of orange the sky turned over Tibidabo at sunset. He loved it, not for the humans who stomped across its surface, but for the thing itself. The great, sprawling, living entity of it. *The Loom of Ages frays.* If that were true, if something was threatening the world—his world, the one that provided his scraps, his art, his quiet existence—could he truly just melt down the messenger and pretend he hadn't heard?

The Font de Canaletes. The famous fountain at the top of La Rambla. Legend had it that those who drank from it were destined to return to Barcelona. For a goblin, it was one of the most dangerous places in the city. Exposed. Brightly lit. Thronged with tourists and locals at all hours. A meeting there, at the zenith of the moon, was either suicidal or a very serious test.

Pau sighed, the sound a little puff of dust in the still air. He placed the vellum scroll back inside the bird’s chest cavity, which clicked shut. He then picked up the inert automaton and tucked it carefully into a large coffee can filled with soft rags, placing the can on the highest shelf. Out of sight, but not out of mind. The decision hadn't been made. Not yet. But the act of preserving the messenger was a decision in itself. For the first time in a long time, the familiar rumble from the market above sounded less like a comfort and more like a clock, ticking. The sun would be up soon. The day would proceed as normal. But tonight, when the moon climbed to the peak of the sky, a choice would have to be made. To remain in the shadows, or to step into the light of the most dangerous place he could imagine.The day passed in a haze of routine made unfamiliar. Pau tried to lose himself in the familiar rhythm of his existence, sorting through a newly acquired bag of bottle caps, their colours ranging from the vibrant red of Catalan beer to the dull gold of expensive cava. He categorised them by hue and size, a mindless, meditative task that usually calmed his nerves. Today, his fingers felt clumsy, his focus fractured. The words on the vellum were burned into his mind, an intrusive counter-melody to the symphony of the market. The shouts of the jamón vendors, the wet slap of fish on ice, the rattling of a cage of live chickens—it all seemed muted, distant, as if he were listening to it through a thick wall of glass.

His work was his anchor, and he turned to it. He selected a handful of iridescent blue tile fragments, their glaze shimmering like a pigeon's throat, and approached the great, curved wall of the cistern. He ran his hand over his mosaic, over the sleeping beast of Barcelona. Here was the Sagrada Família, a spine of jagged white marble chips. There, the harbour, a swirl of sea-glass and bottle-green shards. He had been working on a depiction of the Parc Güell, using the mismatched buttons for the serpentine bench. He picked up a chipped mother-of-pearl button, intending to place it, but hesitated. *The Loom of Ages frays.* The phrase made his own magnum opus feel small, a child’s doodle in the face of some cosmic unravelling. Or did it make it more precious? A fragile record of a world that could be lost. He put the button down. He could not bring himself to add to it, as if to do so would be to accept the world as it was, and not as it might become.

As the afternoon wore on, the smells from the market grew richer, heavier. The cloying sweetness of overripe peaches, the sharp tang of spilled wine, the bloody, iron scent from the butcher stalls. Pau knew them all. He could tell the time of day by the sequence of smells that drifted down through the grates. But today, another scent seemed to underpin them all: the cold, sterile smell of the brass and silver automaton sitting on his shelf. It was the scent of the unknown, a metallic tang of ozone and old magic that cut through the organic fug of his world. It was the smell of a choice he had not yet made. He found himself looking towards the drainage grate, the one the bird had entered through, as if expecting another messenger, or perhaps something more sinister.

When evening finally fell, the roar of the market began to subside, replaced by the clang of metal shutters being pulled down and the hiss of hoses washing away the day's grime. This was Pau’s time. The city above changed its rhythm, the frantic pulse of commerce giving way to the slower, more leisurely beat of evening life. Usually, he would prepare for his nightly excursion, donning a patchwork coat of dark fabrics and checking his tools: a long wire for hooking, a small, sharp knife for cutting, and a leather pouch for his acquisitions. He did so tonight, but his movements were stiff, automatic. His mind was not on the potential treasures in the overflowing bins behind the grand restaurants of the Plaça Reial, but on a fountain a few hundred metres north.

He crept up the iron rungs of a maintenance ladder to his favourite vantage point: a grate set into the floor of a narrow alley just off La Rambla, perpetually damp and smelling of beer and urine. Through the narrow slits, he could see the legs and feet of the evening crowds. An endless river of humanity. He saw expensive leather shoes, worn-out trainers, the teetering stilettos of tourists, and the sturdy boots of the Mossos d'Esquadra on patrol. He saw them as a forest of legs, a tide of mindless motion. They were loud, fragile, and utterly oblivious to the world that existed just a few feet beneath their soles. To go up there, to deliberately walk among them, was a violation of the first and most sacred goblin law: Be Unseen. To be seen was to be caught, to be studied, to be exterminated.

The moon, a perfect, gleaming disc, began its slow climb over the Gothic spires. The zenith. The time was approaching. Pau retreated from the grate, his heart a frantic drum against his ribs. He stood in the centre of his home, the lamplight casting his long, distorted shadow against the mosaic wall. He could stay. He could ignore the call. In a week, the memory of the bird would fade. In a month, it would be a strange dream. He could spend another century cataloguing the city’s refuse, adding to his secret history on the wall. It was a good life. A safe life. He looked at the coffee can. *Your thread is called.* The words were not a request. They were a statement of fact, as simple and undeniable as the rumble of the world above. His grandfather’s words echoed in his memory, sharp and insistent. *A tree without roots is just firewood.* What were his roots, if not this? An ancient call, in an ancient tongue. To deny it was to declare himself rootless. To become driftwood. Firewood.

With a resolve that felt both foreign and deeply familiar, Pau made his way to a loose section of stone behind the stack of telephone directories. He heaved it aside, revealing a small, dark cavity. From within, he withdrew a flat, greasy bundle wrapped in oilcloth. He unrolled it to reveal a set of tools he hadn't touched in decades. They were not for scavenging or tinkering. They were slim, dark, and wickedly sharp. A garrote wire as thin as a hair. A set of lockpicks honed from fish bone. A stiletto with a blade of blackened steel, designed not for cutting twine but for finding the gaps in a coat, or a ribcage. They were the tools of a goblin who expected trouble. He tucked the stiletto into his boot and secreted the lockpicks into the lining of his coat. He would not go to this meeting as a simple scavenger. He would go as Pau de la Boqueria, and he would prove his worth. Taking one last look at the sleeping city on his wall, he turned and scurried towards the ladder, leaving the warmth of his lamp for the cold, uncertain darkness of the city above.The climb was a journey between worlds. One moment, Pau was in the familiar embrace of damp stone and decay; the next, his head emerged from a maintenance shaft into an alleyway, and the city hit him like a physical blow. The air, thin and cool, tasted of diesel fumes, roasted nuts, and the cloying perfume of a passing woman. It was a chemical assault on his earth-tuned senses. He scurried from the open shaft, a sliver of darkness detaching itself from the deeper shadows, and pressed his back against the cold brick of a restaurant kitchen. The heat from a ventilation fan washed over him in a greasy wave, carrying the scent of garlic and frying oil. He moved low and fast, his soft-soled boots making no sound on the grimy pavement, a ghost in the city’s unlit veins.

He avoided the streets entirely, opting for the routes he knew best: the vertical paths. A rusty fire escape took him four stories up, his long fingers finding holds in the corroded iron that a human hand could never use. From there, it was a scramble across a landscape of terracotta tiles, satellite dishes, and forgotten rooftop gardens. Barcelona spread out below him, a vast, glittering tapestry of light and shadow. He saw the city not as the humans did, but as a series of interconnected planes and pathways. A clothesline became a bridge, a narrow ledge a highway, the gap between two buildings a canyon to be leapt with a frantic, wiry grace. This high up, the din of the streets was a muted roar, and he could hear the whisper of the night wind, a sound that was the same here as it was in his sub-cellar home. For a moment, he felt a flicker of his usual peace, the quiet lordship of his unseen domain. But the thought of the fountain below, a pool of impossible light in the darkness, sent a fresh tremor of fear through him.

As he drew closer to the head of La Rambla, the ambient glow of the city intensified, bleaching the night sky to a dull orange. The sound swelled, no longer a distant hum but a chaotic chorus of music, laughter, and the multilingual chatter of the crowds. He found a perch high on the facade of an old bank, tucked into the shadows of a stone carving of a scowling merchant. From here, he could look directly down at the Font de Canaletes. It was even worse than he had imagined. A hundred people, maybe more, swarmed around it, a churning eddy in the human river flowing down the boulevard. They posed for pictures, filled water bottles, and kissed each other under the ornate lamppost, their faces washed in a harsh, electric glare. Pau’s skin crawled. He felt naked, exposed, a single fleck of soot on a vast, white sheet.

He scanned the crowd, his goblin eyes, accustomed to discerning treasure from trash in near-total darkness, searching for a sign, an anomaly. He saw none. Just humans in their endless, bewildering variety. Drunk students, weary couples, wide-eyed tourists clutching maps. No one seemed to be waiting. No one was watching the shadows. The moon crept higher, a pearl against black velvet, until it hung directly overhead, its pure light lost in the gaudy glare of the city. The zenith. Pau held his breath. Nothing. A minute passed, then five. A cold dread, far worse than fear, began to settle in his gut. The dread of being a fool. He had risked everything—his life, his secrecy, his quiet existence—for a prank. A beautifully crafted, impossibly expensive prank. He was an idiot. A gullible, prideful old goblin who had mistaken a piece of clever clockwork for a call from destiny.

Just as he was preparing to retreat, to slink back to his warren and melt the bird down in a fit of bitter rage, a shadow moved. It was on the pavement, near the edge of the crowd, a long, stretched-out human shape cast by a bright shop window. The person casting it was obscured by a newsstand, but their shadow was perfectly clear. And as Pau watched, the shadow’s hand lifted. It did not wave. Instead, the fingers contorted, forming a brief, complex symbol against the pale grey of the stone. A knot of three interlocking lines. It was a glyph from the same proto-goblin alphabet as the script on the vellum. It meant *Follow*. Then the shadow-hand pointed, not towards the fountain, but down a narrow, uninviting alley across the street. The Shadowed Hand guides. It wasn't a metaphor.

Pau didn't hesitate. The absurdity of the situation was washed away by the stark clarity of the instruction. He shimmied down a drainpipe, his descent a controlled fall, and landed silently in the alley behind the bank. He crossed La Rambla in a heartbeat, a dark flicker in the peripheral vision of a taxi driver, a momentary blur between the flashes of a neon sign. He plunged into the alley the shadow had indicated. The transition was breathtaking. The noise of the boulevard was instantly sheared away, replaced by a profound, echoing silence. The air grew thick and cool, smelling of stagnant water and old stone. The alley was a tight, lightless fissure between two towering apartment blocks, ending in a solid brick wall fifty paces ahead. He was halfway down when a voice spoke from the darkness in front of him, a low, feminine whisper that was as sharp as broken glass.

“You are late, mosaic-maker.”

Pau froze, his hand instinctively dropping to the hilt of the stiletto in his boot. A figure detached itself from the absolute blackness near the dead end. Another goblin. But of a kind Pau had never seen outside of half-forgotten legends. She was tall for their kind, lean and sharp-edged, clad not in scavenged cloth but in tight-fitting black leather that seemed to absorb what little light there was. Her face was a series of severe angles, and her eyes, catching a stray reflection, glittered like chips of obsidian. There was no dirt under her long, clean nails. She carried no bag, no tools for scavenging. She herself was a tool.

"The moon waits for no one," Pau rasped, finding his voice. "It was at its zenith."

A faint, humourless smile touched her lips. "Punctuality is not the same as promptness. The summons was a test of courage. This is the test of skill." She gestured with her chin towards a small, recessed doorway he hadn't noticed, the entrance to what looked like an antique shop. The door was old, heavy oak, with a formidable-looking iron lock and two thick deadbolts. "Señor Escribà, the proprietor, is in Andorra for the weekend. On the desk just inside, there is a small music box made of polished walnut. Your thread is inside it. Bring it to me." She crossed her arms, her obsidian eyes pinning him in place. "You have until the shadow of that chimney," she nodded towards the rooftops, "touches the far wall. Break nothing. Make no sound. The Shadowed Hand does not employ the clumsy."A test. Pau’s resentment, a hot, coppery taste in the back of his throat, was quickly cooled by a chilling wave of professional appraisal. This was a craftsman’s challenge, and he was a craftsman. He glanced at the moving shadow of the chimney, a creeping knife of black against the alley wall. Time was a luxury. He knelt before the door, his long, spidery fingers ghosting over the cold iron faceplate of the lock. He could feel the quality of it, the tight tolerances, the weight of the mechanism within. This was no mass-produced piece of junk; it was old, probably from the nineteenth century, and made to last. His task was not to defeat it, but to persuade it. He pulled the slim oilcloth bundle from his coat lining. The fish-bone lockpicks felt alien in his hands after so many years, delicate and brittle. They were tools from a different life, a time before he had committed himself to the quiet art of finding instead of the bolder art of taking.

He slid a thin tension wrench into the keyhole, applying the barest whisper of pressure, and then introduced the first pick. He closed his eyes, shutting out the oppressive darkness of the alley and the unnerving stillness of the female goblin. His world shrank to the geography of the lock, a tiny, intricate landscape of pins, springs, and levers. He was no longer a goblin in an alley, but a surgeon probing for a pulse. The first pin, a soft click. The second, a grittier protest before it set. He worked methodically, his breathing shallow, his entire being focused on the faint vibrations travelling up the bone pick into his fingertips. The cylinder gave a fractional turn, a sigh of surrender. The first deadbolt was thrown. He did not pause to savour the small victory, but immediately moved to the second lock. This one was different. Newer, cruder, and with a security pin designed to catch a clumsy tool. It was a brawler, not a gentleman. Pau’s grandfather had called such locks 'liars'.

The security pin snagged his pick immediately, giving a false set that a younger, more eager Pau would have fallen for. He felt the trap, a subtle wrongness in the tension, and backed off, releasing the pressure on the wrench. He had to dance with this one, to coax the pin up just enough without allowing it to lock the cylinder. He switched to a different pick, one with a hook as fine as a cat's claw, and went back in. It was a painstaking process, a microscopic negotiation of push and release, of listening and feeling. The chimney shadow had consumed a third of the wall. He could feel the other goblin’s gaze on him, a physical weight on his shoulders. He ignored it. There was only the lie of the lock and his patient, methodical search for the truth. Then, a tiny, almost inaudible *snick*. The security pin was overcome. A few moments later, the final pin clicked into place, and the cylinder turned with a smooth, oiled finality. Pau withdrew his tools, slid the deadbolt back, and turned the heavy iron handle. The door swung open without a sound, revealing a chasm of deeper blackness filled with the scent of beeswax and time.

He slipped inside, pulling the door to but not latching it, and was immediately enveloped. The antique shop was a mausoleum of forgotten stories. Moonlight, strained through the grimy front window, illuminated towers of furniture draped in white sheets like slumbering ghosts. The air was thick with the perfumes of old paper, decaying velvet, and the faint, metallic tang of silver polish. A forest of grandfather clocks stood silent against one wall, their pendulums still, their faces bearing a dozen different times, all of them wrong. It was a more organized, more valuable version of his own warren, and it called to the deepest parts of his goblin soul. His eyes, now fully adjusted to the gloom, darted everywhere, cataloguing, desiring. A tray of military medals, their ribbons faded. A porcelain doll with a cracked face, its painted smile more unnerving than Cobi's. A hand-tinted map of a Barcelona that no longer existed.

The desk was at the back, a vast slab of mahogany cluttered with the ephemera of the antique trade: auction catalogues, loupes, and small, velvet-lined boxes. And there it was. A music box of polished walnut, its surface gleaming even in the faint light. It was beautiful, simple, and elegant. As he reached for it, his gaze fell on a small, open crate next to the desk, filled with discarded ceramic fragments. His breath caught in his throat. It was a trove of *trencadís*, and one piece shone with a lustre he had only ever seen in illustrations. A shard of Gaudí's original glaze from the Casa Batlló, a perfect iridescent ripple of blue and green, like a dragon's scale. To possess it would be the crowning jewel of his collection. His fingers twitched. He could slip it into his pocket. Who would know? The woman outside? She had said break nothing and make no sound. She had not forbidden acquisition. But this was not about scavenging. This was about the mission. The thread. With a pang of loss so sharp it felt like a physical wound, he turned his back on the dragon’s scale and picked up the music box.

It was heavier than he expected, cool and solid in his hands. He could feel the intricate mechanism inside, a miniature engine of springs and gears waiting for release. He resisted the urge to wind it. The test was not over. A tiny brass clasp held the lid shut. He flicked it open with his thumbnail. Inside, nestled on a bed of faded red velvet, there was no spinning ballerina, no metal comb to pluck the notes. There was only a small, wooden spindle, around which was wound a single, luminous thread. It shimmered with an internal light, a pale silver-gold that seemed to pulse with a slow, steady rhythm, like something breathing. It was not spun from any material he knew; it felt like solidified moonlight. *Your thread is called.* This was it. The physical manifestation of the summons. He carefully lifted the spindle from its velvet bed, its light casting a faint, ethereal glow on his sallow skin. He closed the music box, placed it back on the desk exactly as he had found it, and turned to leave, the glowing spindle held tight in his fist. The test of skill was complete. Now, he suspected, the real trial would begin.He slipped back into the alley, pulling the heavy oak door until the latch clicked home with a sound no louder than a sigh. The air was cold on his face, a sudden shock after the dusty stillness of the shop. The female goblin had not moved. She was an effigy of patience carved from night and leather. The chimney shadow had crept only a hand's breadth further along the wall; the time limit had been a fiction, a lever to apply pressure and measure his composure. He opened his hand. The spindle lay on his palm, its thread of captive light pulsing softly, casting his long, sallow face in a ghostly, otherworldly glow. It was the only source of light in the fissure between the buildings, and in it, he saw her eyes properly for the first time. They were not black, but a deep, starless violet.

She took the spindle from him, her cool, dry fingers brushing his. It was a brief, impersonal contact, yet it sent a jolt through him, a current of energy that had nothing to do with the mundane world. She did not examine the spindle itself, but the thread wound around it, holding it close to her face. Her expression remained a mask of detached scrutiny. "The thread is true," she stated, her voice a low murmur that the alley walls seemed to drink. "It resonates with the pattern. You were the correct choice." It was not praise, but a confirmation of data, as if she were a scientist who had just proven a hypothesis. She held the spindle out for him to take back.

"What is this?" Pau asked, his voice a rough whisper. His courage, bolstered by the successful infiltration, was beginning to fray. "What is this 'Loom' you speak of?"

"It is not a thing to be spoken of in alleys," she replied, her eyes flicking towards the mouth of the alley, towards the distant noise of La Rambla. "It is the structure of what is. The tapestry of cause and effect, of history and fate. Every life, every event, every choice is a thread woven into it. The Weaver, the great intelligence that has maintained its balance since the dawn of time, has faltered. Its threads are tangling. Some are snapping altogether. The world is beginning to unravel at the seams. What you feel as the rumble of the city, we feel as the shuddering of reality itself."

Pau stared at her, then at the glowing spindle in his hand. The scale of it was incomprehensible. A cosmic tapestry. A failing god-entity. It was the stuff of human myth, not the practical, dirt-under-the-fingernails reality of a goblin's life. "This is madness," he breathed. "A task for kings and wizards, not… not for me. I am a scavenger. A hermit. I collect broken tiles. Why would your Shadowed Hand call my thread? There are warriors, clan chiefs, scholars—"

"The Loom does not need another sword to slash at it," she cut in, her voice sharp as the stiletto in his boot. "It does not need a scholar to catalogue its destruction. It needs a mender. We have watched you, Pau de la Boqueria. We have seen your secret work. That sleeping city on your cistern wall is more than a hobby. It is your soul made manifest. You take the broken, the forgotten, the discarded, and you see not trash, but potential. You piece the fragments together to make a whole that is stronger and more beautiful than its individual parts. That is a rare and powerful magic, mosaic-maker. It is the magic of restoration. The Loom is breaking. It needs a hand that knows how to piece it back together."

The words struck Pau with the force of a physical blow, knocking the breath from his lungs. His art. His secret, pointless, beautiful mosaic. All this time he had thought of it as a private obsession, a way to pass the lonely years, to impose a quiet order on the chaos of the overworld's waste. He had never imagined it was a skill, a *magic*, that had been observed, judged, and now summoned. The pride he felt was dizzying, terrifying. It was a vertiginous feeling, like standing on the highest spire of the Sagrada Família. He looked down at the spindle. Its light seemed brighter now, warmer. It was not just a summons; it was a validation of his entire existence.

"This thread has bound you," the goblin continued, her tone shifting back to the clipped, impersonal efficiency of a field commander. "Now that you have accepted it, you are visible to those who would see the Loom unravel completely. Your warren beneath the market is no longer a sanctuary; it is a liability. Your quiet life is over." She reached inside her leather tunic and produced a small, flat disc of dark, polished stone. "Your next task is to survive. This will help. It will mask the light of your thread from casual scrying, but a direct gaze will still find you. You must leave this city. There is a place, a sanctuary for those of us who serve the Loom, hidden in the mountains of Montserrat. You must go there. Find the monastery, and from there, seek the path to Sant Jeroni, the highest peak. At the summit, look not for a door, but for a shadow that does not move with the sun."

She pressed the cool, smooth stone into his free hand. It felt impossibly dense, a sliver of solidified night. "Go now. Gather what you need, but be quick. You have been exposed. The light of the fountain, the energy of the thread—it is a beacon. You are being hunted already. Do not go back the way you came. The city's skin is no longer safe. Use the deep ways. The sewers." With a final, piercing look from her violet eyes, she stepped back, melting into the deeper darkness at the end of the alley. For a moment, he thought she had simply vanished, but then he heard the faintest scrape of leather on stone, the metallic whisper of a manhole cover being lifted from below. Then, silence. Pau stood alone in the alley, the chaotic pulse of La Rambla at his back, the profound, waiting silence of the deep ways before him, and in his hands, a glowing thread and a piece of night, the twin weights of his new and terrible purpose.For a long moment, Pau remained frozen in the oppressive silence of the alley, a creature caught between two irreconcilable worlds. At his back was the city of men, a riot of meaningless light and sound he had spent a century avoiding. Ahead, promised by the vanished goblin, was a war of cosmic scale, a reality of fraying looms and shadowed hands that defied all logic. He looked down at his hands. In one, he clutched the spindle, its thread a pale, living light that felt impossibly ancient. In the other, the disc of stone, so cold and dense it seemed to drink the warmth from his very bones. His quiet life was over. The thought was not a whisper but a scream in the solitude of his mind, a final, brutal severing of the thread that had connected him to his peaceful, predictable past.

His first, desperate instinct was to obey, to flee into the deep ways and never look back. But the second, deeper instinct, the one that defined him, rebelled. His home. The collage of his life was down there, not just as a shelter but as an extension of himself. The mechanical bird, the catalyst for this madness, was on his shelf. His tools, his treasures, the mismatched buttons and the cracked clock face—they were his history. And the mosaic… the thought of abandoning his sleeping city to be discovered, or worse, to simply crumble unseen in the damp, was a pain sharper than any stiletto. He had to go back. It was not a choice, but a compulsion. He would be fast. A ghost returning to his own grave for one last look. He scurried to the dead end of the alley and found the manhole cover the female goblin had used. It was heavy, but his wiry strength, honed by a lifetime of prying and hauling, was sufficient. He braced himself, lifted, and slid it aside just enough to slip through, the grating of iron on stone deafening in the silence. The familiar, foul-smelling darkness of the sewers rose up to greet him like an old, unpleasant friend.

He moved through the subterranean labyrinth with a speed that would have been impossible on the surface. This was his true territory. He knew the curve of every brick-lined tunnel, the sound of the water in each channel, the places where the ceiling was dangerously low. He ran along narrow, slime-coated ledges, his bare feet finding purchase where a booted human would have slipped to their doom. The main sewer line, a torrent of the city’s filth, roared in the central channel beside him, its deafening rush a comfort that drowned out the frantic beating of his own heart. For a few precious moments, a sense of control returned. He was a creature of the deep places, and here, at least, he was master. But the female goblin’s words echoed in the rushing water: *You are being hunted.* The familiar shadows seemed to lengthen, to twist into unfamiliar shapes. Every drip of water from a side pipe sounded like a footstep. Every gust of fetid air felt like the breath of something just around the bend.

Then he heard it. A sound that did not belong. It was not the gurgle of water, the scuttling of a rat pack, or the distant rumble of the metro. It was a rhythmic, dragging scrape. Metal on stone. It came from a connecting tunnel far behind him, echoing strangely, a dead, patient sound. *Scrape… pause… scrape.* It was methodical. It sounded like something heavy being pulled, or like claws of iron testing the walls as it moved. Pau’s blood ran cold. It was the sound of a search. A slow, relentless, inhuman search. The warning was no longer a prophecy; it was a reality, and it was closing in. He abandoned all caution, his stealth dissolving into a frantic, desperate scramble towards his warren.

He burst into his home through the hidden entrance near the cistern, a wild animal diving for its burrow. The oil lamp he had left burning cast a gentle, welcoming glow over the familiar chaos of his life, but the light brought no comfort. It felt like a spotlight, a beacon advertising his presence to whatever was scraping its way through the tunnels. His first act was to take out the cold stone disc and place it over the spindle clutched in his hand. As stone touched wood, the luminous thread was instantly snuffed out, its supernatural glow collapsing into the object as if it had never been. The room plunged back into the simple, flickering gloom of the oil lamp, and Pau could breathe again. The feeling of being a shining target in the dark receded, but the scraping sound, though distant, was a constant, terrifying reminder.

With a surge of adrenaline, he began to move. He grabbed a worn leather satchel, his largest, and started filling it with a mad, desperate triage of his possessions. The stiletto went back into his boot. The oilcloth bundle of lockpicks was tucked into an inner pocket of his coat. A coil of his finest copper wire. His flint and steel. The half-eaten wedge of Manchego and the last of his stolen lemons. He worked with a frantic economy of motion, his mind a whirlwind of calculation and panic. He snatched the coffee can from its high shelf; the weight of the inert mechanical bird inside felt momentous, the source of all his current terror and his only clue to the future. He was a collector, a hoarder, and the act of choosing what to leave behind was a series of a thousand tiny deaths.

His eyes fell upon the great mosaic, the sleeping city on the cistern wall. The lamplight danced across the fragments of glass and ceramic, making the beast seem to breathe. Here was his life. A century of patient observation and quiet creation, a secret history of Barcelona told in its own broken skin. A profound, soul-crushing grief washed over him. He could not take it. It was as much a part of this place as the stone itself. To leave it was to leave his heart behind. He reached out a trembling hand, his long fingers tracing the curve of the harbour, the jagged spine of the cathedral, the swirl of the Parc Güell. The scraping in the tunnels seemed to have stopped, a sudden silence that was more terrifying than the noise itself. Time was up. Acting on pure instinct, he drew his stiletto. With the surgical precision of a jeweller, he inserted the very tip of the blade beside a tiny shard of iridescent blue-green glass that formed part of the sleeping beast’s dreaming eye. A quick, sharp twist, and the fragment came loose. He snatched it up—a piece of his soul no bigger than his thumbnail—and thrust it deep into his pocket.

Taking the satchel and the can, he gave his home one last, sweeping glance. The shelves of treasures, the yellowing faces on the walls, the ghost of Cobi smiling from the chipped plate. It was a perfect, beautiful, fragile world, and it was no longer his. He snuffed out the lamp, and the darkness that consumed the room was absolute. Turning his back on everything he had ever been, he scrambled into the access tunnel, heaving the heavy stone slab into place behind him. He was sealed out. The sound of the scraping began again, much closer this time, just one tunnel over. He did not wait to learn its source. He was no longer Pau de la Boqueria, artist and recluse. He was a fugitive, a panicked breath in the dark, plunging deeper into the earth, running for the mountains and the cold, unknown promise of the dawn.The darkness of the deep ways was a different beast from the comfortable gloom of his warren. It was a hungry, living blackness, absolute and without texture, pressing in on him from all sides. He ran blind, his bare feet slapping against the slick, narrow ledges of a tertiary conduit. His other senses screamed to fill the void. The air was a thick cocktail of rot and chemicals, so different from the earthy dampness of his home. The omnipresent roar of the main channel became his compass, a thundering baseline to the north, while the scraping sound behind him was a frantic, terrifying percussion that drove him south, away from the city's heart. He was a creature of these tunnels, but he had never traversed them in such a state of pure terror, not as a scavenger exploring his domain, but as prey fleeing a predator whose nature he could not begin to fathom.

The scraping grew louder, echoing in the confined space until it seemed to come from all directions at once. *Scrape-clank… scrape-clank…* It was gaining. Panic, cold and sharp, threatened to lock his limbs. He needed to break the line of sight, to find a crack in this world of brick and filth where he could disappear. His questing fingers, running along the wall as he fled, found it: a narrow, vertical fissure, a flaw in the brickwork where the tunnel wall had settled, barely wider than his shoulders. He squeezed himself into the gap, flattening his body against the cold, weeping stone, pulling his satchel in tight against his chest. He held his breath, his heart hammering a frantic, silent rhythm. The air in the main tunnel stirred, and a foul, hot wind washed over him, carrying a scent he had never encountered before—the smell of hot metal, ozone, and something like wet rust.

A shape emerged from the darkness, illuminated by a sickly, internal green light that pulsed from deep within its form. It was not a goblin, nor any beast he knew. It was a grotesque parody of an insect, a construct of corroded brass and blackened iron, as large as a wolf. It moved on four multi-jointed, spider-like legs, two of which were tipped not with feet, but with heavy, sharpened blades that scraped and sparked against the stone floor, creating the dreadful sound that had pursued him. Its body was a furnace of churning gears and pistons, visible through a tarnished brass ribcage. Where a head should be, a single, swivelling lens of polished green crystal swept the tunnel, casting its analytical, dead light from wall to wall. It was a thing of pure function, an automaton of erasure. It paused, its lens sweeping over the very crack where Pau hid. He felt its cold, alien perception wash over him, a gaze that did not see but scanned, searching for a specific energy, a specific light. The cold stone disc in his pocket felt like a block of ice, his only shield against that dead, green stare. After a moment that stretched into an eternity, the construct seemed to reach a conclusion. With a hiss of steam and a final, jarring scrape of its bladed feet, it continued its relentless patrol down the tunnel, its green glow and the rhythmic sound of its passage slowly fading into the echoing dark.

Shaking uncontrollably, Pau waited until the last echo had died before he dared to move. He stumbled from his hiding place, the image of the hunter burned into his mind. That thing was not a prank. It was a weapon, and it was searching for the light he now carried. The Shadowed Hand had not been exaggerating the danger. He had to get out, to escape the confines of the city's underbelly and the labyrinth that now felt like a trap. He abandoned the familiar paths and plunged into the older, deeper sections of the network, guided by a half-forgotten map of rumours and whispers from other scavengers. The tunnels transformed, the uniform brick of the modern era giving way to the massive, mossy stones of the medieval city, and then deeper still, into the low, arched perfection of the Roman cloacae. The air grew cleaner, the roar of the central sewer faded, replaced by the trickle of ground-water. He was moving towards the city's edge, towards the Llobregat river, following a path that hadn't been used by man or goblin in a millennium.

He finally emerged, gasping, from the mouth of a stone culvert half-choked with weeds and debris, and collapsed onto a muddy bank. The world was vast, grey, and silent. The pre-dawn sky was a wash of pale lilac and charcoal, and the air was shockingly cold and clean, smelling of river water and damp earth. Behind him, the sprawling mass of Barcelona was a distant smudge of light pollution against the dark horizon. Before him, across the slow-moving, dark water of the river, lay a desolate expanse of industrial parks and fallow fields. And there, in the far distance, rising like a row of jagged teeth against the lightening sky, was the unmistakable silhouette of Montserrat. The sight was terrifying. He had spent his entire life in the belly of the beast, in a world of tunnels, cellars, and enclosed spaces. To be out here, under the infinite, empty bowl of the sky, made his skin prickle with agoraphobic dread. He was a creature of the cracks, and he was standing in the middle of a vast, empty page.

Finding refuge in a thick stand of rustling reeds, Pau finally allowed the full weight of his loss to descend. He sat shivering in the mud, not just from the cold, but from the violent amputation of his past. He clutched the satchel to his chest, the objects within—the silent bird, the coil of wire, the wedge of cheese—feeling like pathetic, meaningless trinkets. He was adrift. A scavenger with nothing left to scavenge, an artist whose magnum opus was abandoned to the dark. He reached into his pocket and his fingers closed around the two objects there: the cold, heavy disc of night-stone, and the tiny, sharp-edged shard of his mosaic. He pulled the shard out. It was the dragon's scale from his sleeping city's eye. Even in the faint light, its iridescent glaze shimmered with a defiant beauty. He had been a collector of broken things, a restorer of fragments. Now, he himself was the fragment. He was a single, broken piece of a life that no longer existed. He looked from the shard in his hand to the distant, saw-toothed mountains. The journey seemed utterly impossible, a fool's errand for a shattered goblin. But then he felt the hard lump of the coffee can against his back, and he remembered the exquisite perfection of the bird, the luminous promise of the thread, and the chilling purpose of the hunter. He wasn't just a fragment. He was a fragment with a purpose. Clutching the tiny piece of his old world, he turned his face towards the mountains, and began to walk.The world beyond the culvert was an assault. Dawn was not the pale suggestion over the Mediterranean that Pau knew, but a raw, aggressive wound of colour tearing open the eastern sky. The sun, when it finally breached the horizon, was a physical force, a hammer of light that struck him with an alien intensity. He had spent his life in shadow, his eyes accustomed to discerning nuance in the gloom; this unfiltered brilliance was a searing pain that sent him scurrying for the meagre cover of a gnarled olive tree. He felt flayed, stripped of the comforting layers of brick and stone, exposed under the terrifying, infinite void of the open sky. Every sound was sharp and strange: the frantic, high-pitched chirping of unseen birds was a chaotic nuisance compared to the mechanical bird's fractured melody; the sighing of the wind through the tall grasses was a lonely, desolate whisper unlike the familiar, contained rumbles of his sub-cellar world. He was an organ ripped from a body, lying exposed and twitching in a hostile and sterile new environment.

His journey began as a desperate crawl through the liminal space between city and country. He navigated the ragged edges of industrial parks, vast, soulless territories littered with a kind of waste he didn't recognise. Here there were no half-eaten delicacies or discarded treasures, only rusted barrels leaking chemical rainbows into the dirt, piles of shattered concrete, and the skeletal remains of burnt-out machinery. This was not the rich, organic detritus of human life he knew how to read and repurpose; this was the city's dead skin, inorganic and offering no sustenance, no story he cared to hear. He moved in a low crouch, dashing from the shadow of one crumbling warehouse to the next, the distant, saw-toothed peaks of Montserrat his only guide, a constant, mocking reminder of the impossible distance he had yet to cross.

Hunger, a familiar companion he had always known how to manage, became a new and unpredictable enemy. The wedge of cheese in his satchel was a finite resource he guarded with a miser's paranoia. He saw a cluster of bright red berries on a bush and his instincts screamed 'treasure', but his knowledge was a blank slate. Were they jewels of sustenance or beads of poison? In the market, he knew the life cycle of every fruit, the subtle signs of rot versus ripeness. Here, he was an illiterate fool. He lapped at a still puddle in a tractor's furrow and spat out the water, which tasted not of the familiar chemical tang of the city's runoff, but of a living, wriggling earthiness that his stomach rejected. He was a master of a domain he had left behind, and a helpless infant in this new, green world.

By mid-morning he reached a new kind of river, a roaring torrent of metal and rubber. A highway. The sound was a low, constant roar, punctuated by the doppler-shift shrieks of passing trucks. It was a barrier more formidable than any wall, a zone of absolute exposure patrolled by unthinking iron beasts. Crouching in a ditch overgrown with thorny brambles, he watched the traffic for what felt like an hour, his goblin senses overwhelmed by the speed and noise. He was used to the forest of human legs, but these were giants moving at impossible velocities. He finally saw a gap, a momentary lull in the chaos, and he ran. It was a blind, heart-stopping sprint across four lanes of hot, black asphalt, his bare feet burning on the sun-baked surface. The blast of a truck's horn was a physical blow, a sound of pure, mindless power that sent him tumbling into the ditch on the far side, his body trembling, the smell of diesel fumes thick in his throat.

The rest of the day was a slow, agonizing trek through a patchwork of vineyards and fallow fields. The sun was a relentless eye in the sky, forcing him into a new pattern of survival. He learned to read the land not for its potential acquisitions, but for its shadows, moving from the shade of one lonely cypress to a dry irrigation ditch, to the cool lee of a stone wall. He felt horribly visible, a single dark flaw in a landscape of green and gold. The paranoia that had started in the sewer returned with a vengeance. A glint of sun on a shard of glass in a field became the green lens of the hunter. The shadow of a hawk circling high above became a predator sent to track him. He found himself constantly, instinctively clutching the cold stone disc in his pocket, a talisman against the crushing agoraphobia and the feeling of being perpetually watched.

As the sun began its descent, painting the sky in shades of bruised orange and purple, the land began to rise. The flat, soft earth gave way to gravelly soil and the first stony outcrops of the foothills. This was a verticality he understood, a language of handholds and footholds. His spirits, crushed by the vast emptiness of the plains, lifted fractionally as he scrambled up a steep embankment, his long fingers finding purchase in the rough, solid rock. He felt a sliver of his old self return, the master of the hidden paths. He found shelter for the night in a place that felt blessedly familiar: a crack. It was a narrow, wind-scoured hollow at the base of a limestone boulder, barely large enough for him to curl into, but it had a roof and solid walls. It was a pale imitation of his warren, but it was enough.

From the mouth of his meagre shelter, he watched the last of the light fade. In the far distance, the place where Barcelona lay was no longer a city but a faint, hazy dome of light pollution, a stain of gold on the horizon. It was the glow of a life that was no longer his, a ghost on the edge of the world. He was truly alone. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the iridescent shard, the dragon's scale from his mosaic. He turned the tiny fragment over in his fingers, its man-made perfection a stark contrast to the rough stone of his shelter and the wild, untamed land that stretched before him. This tiny, sharp-edged piece of beauty was all that was left of Pau the artist. It was the last thread connecting him to the goblin who had lived in the quiet dark, piecing together a broken world. He looked from the shard to the dark, imposing silhouette of the mountains, a fortress of stone against the stars. The choice had been made for him, but the path was his to walk. He was a fragment, yes, but he was a fragment on a journey. With a grim resolve that settled deep in his bones, he put the shard away, tucked his head down, and surrendered to a cold, fitful sleep, dreaming of a sleeping city made of glass and stone.He woke to the unforgiving cold of the stone at his back and the raw ache of muscles he hadn't known he possessed. His dreams had been a suffocating swirl of familiar tunnels and the smell of damp newsprint, a comforting embrace that made the waking reality of this stark, open wilderness a brutal slap. The pre-dawn light was thin and grey, leaching the world of colour, and the silence was a living thing, a vast, ringing emptiness that pressed in on his ears. Far above him, the serrated peaks of Montserrat tore at the sky, a fortress of silent, colossal stone. The mountain did not rumble; it judged. Pau unwrapped the last of his Manchego, its familiar, oily sweat a ghost of a life already feeling impossibly distant. He ate it slowly, methodically, as he had eaten the sardines, but there was no comfort in the taste, only the cold calculus of fuel for the ordeal to come. When it was gone, he was left with only the lemons and the unknown. He had officially consumed his past.

The ascent was a return to a more primal goblin instinct, a part of him that predated scavenging and the art of mosaics. His long, sallow fingers, so adept at picking through rubbish or placing a tiny shard of glass, curled with natural ease around the sharp edges of the rock. He found he could read the face of a cliff as he once read the contents of a discarded crate, seeing the hidden pathways, the subtle shifts in texture that promised a solid hold, the treacherous patches of loose scree to be avoided. He moved with a wiry, vertical grace, a creature rediscovering its elemental form. The agoraphobia that had plagued him on the plains lessened with every foot he gained in altitude, replaced by a focused, animalistic intensity. Here, the world was not an empty page but a complex surface to be navigated, a vertical maze that rewarded skill and attention. The sky was still a terrifying void above, but his focus was on the stone immediately before him, a universe of cracks and ledges just inches from his nose.

He learned through brutal trial and error. A handful of tempting black berries resulted in a violent cramping of his gut that left him weak and trembling in the shade of a juniper bush for an hour. Later, parched and desperate, he watched a trio of mountain goats drink from a trickle of water seeping from a rock face, their own instincts his only guide. He followed their lead, pressing his lips to the cold, mossy stone and drinking the clean, mineral-sharp water. It was the first gift this new world had given him, and the relief was so profound it bordered on religious. He began to observe, not for discarded treasures, but for the patterns of life. He watched the way lizards sunned themselves, the flight paths of kestrels on the thermal updrafts, the hardy, wind-scoured plants that clung to life in the most impossible of places. It was a new kind of literacy, and he was a painfully slow student.

The hunter was never far from his thoughts. As he traversed a high, windy ridge, he found a sign of it. The carcass of a mountain goat lay wedged between two boulders, not torn by wolves or a falling rock, but killed with a chilling, unnatural precision. A single, perfectly round hole had been bored through its torso, the edges of the wound cleanly cauterized, blackened and smooth to the touch. The scent of ozone and hot metal, a ghost from the sewer tunnels, still hung faintly in the air. The automaton had been here. It could climb. It was not bound by the roads and flatlands. The knowledge settled in his stomach like a cold stone, extinguishing the small spark of confidence he had gained. The hunt was not over; it had simply changed its terrain. The cold disc in his pocket felt less like a shield and more like a temporary blindfold, and he found himself scrambling faster, with a renewed desperation, towards the distant gleam of his first landmark.

It appeared late the next day, a sudden, impossible vision of human order amidst the wild chaos of the mountains. The Monastery of Santa Maria de Montserrat. It clung to the side of the mountain like a swallow's nest of breathtaking scale, its stone walls and romanesque arches a defiant statement of geometry against the mountain's organic fury. From his hiding place in a cluster of wind-stunted pines, Pau watched it for hours as the sun set. He saw the black-robed men moving with quiet purpose along the stone ramparts, heard the distant, ethereal sound of their choral chant carried on the wind. For them, this was a place of faith and solitude. For Pau, it was a fortress of giants, another part of the overworld to be navigated with caution and stealth. It was also, he realised with a familiar pang of goblin pragmatism, a potential source of high-quality waste.

Under the cover of a moonless night, he crept closer, a shadow among shadows. He moved along the monastery's periphery, his old skills reawakening in this new context. He found the kitchens by their smell—a glorious, maddening cloud of baking bread and roasting meat—and located their refuse pile in a small, walled-off enclosure. It was a treasure trove. A half-loaf of dense, crusty bread, a handful of bruised but edible apples, and the fatty rind from a piece of cured pork. It was a feast. He devoured the apples on the spot, the burst of sweet juice an unimaginable luxury, and stuffed the bread and rind into his satchel. It was a small, desperate act of scavenging, a moment of normalcy in a world turned upside down, and it anchored him. He was still Pau de la Boqueria. He was still a finder of lost things. This bread was not a relic for a mosaic; it was life itself. Bolstered by the food and the minor victory, he oriented himself. The monastery was the anchor point. Sant Jeroni, the highest peak, was now a clear goal, a final, brutal climb into the clouds above. The path was clear.The path beyond the monastery was no path at all, but a suggestion, a faint scar of a trail used more by goats than by monks, which soon dissolved entirely into a sheer, vertical wilderness of stone. The bread in Pau's satchel was a dense, comforting weight, a ballast against the rising tide of fear. He ate a small piece, the rough crust scraping his tongue, the soft interior a taste of a world of hearths and ovens he might never know again. With every hundred feet he climbed, the air grew thinner, sharper, a knife in his lungs. The world of men fell away below him, the magnificent monastery shrinking to a child's toy block, then to a mere speck, until it was swallowed by the haze. He was alone with the mountain, the wind, and the sky.

The climb became a brutal, rhythmic meditation. Hand over hand, foot over foot, find the hold, test it, shift his weight, and repeat. His world shrank to the few feet of rock face before him. His mind, which had been a frantic storm of loss and fear, was scoured clean by the sheer, overwhelming focus required to stay alive. The memories of his warren, the smell of damp paper, the curve of Cobi's smile, they became distant, polished stones in his memory, things he could no longer afford the luxury of dwelling on. He was being remade, forged in the crucible of wind and stone. The soft, sallow skin of his hands grew calloused and tough. The wiry scavenger's muscles in his arms and legs hardened into bands of iron. He was no longer a goblin of the city's belly; he was becoming a goblin of the mountain's peak, a creature as sinewy and resilient as the wind-stunted pines clinging to the cliffsides.

He was traversing a narrow, knife-edge ridge, the world falling away into a dizzying abyss on either side, when he saw it. Far below, in the labyrinth of canyons he had just struggled through, a light moved. It was the same sickly, analytical green, pulsing like a diseased heart. The automaton. It moved with an unnatural efficiency, not scrambling as he had, but flowing up the rock faces, its bladed legs finding purchase with a logic that was both terrifying and flawless. It was not tiring. It did not need to rest or find water. It was a concept of pursuit given physical form, and it was climbing faster than he was. A fresh wave of adrenaline, bitter and metallic, flooded his system. This was no longer a journey; it was a race. He pushed himself harder, ignoring the screaming protest of his muscles, the burning in his lungs. The wind tore at him, a physical entity trying to pry him from the mountain and cast him into the void, but the image of the green light below was a far more potent terror.

After an eternity of struggle that spanned the rest of the day and into the next, he hauled himself over the final, jagged lip of rock and collapsed onto the summit. He had arrived. Sant Jeroni. It was a stark, wind-blasted crown of stone, surrounded by a breathtaking, terrifying emptiness. The world was spread out beneath him in a silent, impossible map. To the east, the distant glimmer of the Mediterranean. To the north, the snow-dusted peaks of the Pyrenees. Clouds drifted below him, a soft white sea from which other, lesser peaks emerged like islands. The sheer scale of it was an agony to his crack-dwelling soul. He was the highest point for miles, a lone, pathetic figure on a stage built for gods, exposed to the infinite, uncaring gaze of the sky. There was nowhere left to climb, nowhere left to hide. He was at the end of the path.

He forced himself to his feet, his legs trembling with exhaustion, and began the final task. He scanned the summit, a chaotic jumble of weathered grey rock. *Seek the shadow that does not move with the sun.* The sun was high, and the shadows were short, stark patches of black against the pale stone. He found a vantage point and waited, his body screaming for rest, but his mind locked on the puzzle. He watched as the sun began its slow arc across the sky. He saw the shadows lengthen, shift, and crawl across the rock like slow-moving ink spills. Every shadow moved. Every single one. Frustration, sharp and bitter, welled up in him. It was another trick, a fool's errand. He was meant to die up here, exposed and exhausted, while the hunter inexorably climbed towards him. He slumped against a boulder, defeat a cold weight in his belly. His hand went to his pocket, his fingers finding the sharp-edged comfort of his mosaic shard. He thought of his art, of how the right piece was never the most obvious, but the one whose shape was an answer to the empty space. He was looking at the shadows *on* the stone, not for a shadow *of* the stone itself.

With a jolt, he understood. He scrambled to his feet, his eyes no longer following the moving shadows, but scanning the very structure of the rocks themselves. He was looking for a flaw, a fold, a permanent absence of light. And he found it. On the north face of the highest cluster of boulders, where the sun's rays could never reach directly, there was a fissure. It was a deep, vertical slash in the rock, no wider than his arm, but it was a void of perfect, absolute blackness. While all the shadows around it shifted and changed with the passing hours, this sliver of night remained constant, unwavering. A shadow that did not move with the sun. He approached it cautiously. The wind that howled across the rest of the summit was strangely absent here. The air before the fissure was still, cold, and silent. It was not an entrance in the way a door was an entrance; it was a cessation, a tear in the fabric of the mountain. He took one last look at the vast, open world behind him, the world of sun and wind and sky that he had crossed but would never belong to. Then, clutching the satchel to his chest, he took a breath of the cold, still air, and stepped into the unmoving dark.The passage through the shadow was not a movement through space, but a stripping away of it. The wind, the cold, the solid feel of the rock beneath his feet—all vanished in an instant. There was no sensation of falling, no disorientation, only a profound and terrifying negation. Sound ceased to exist, not as silence, but as an absolute absence of the very concept of acoustics. Light was extinguished from his memory. He was a thought without a mind, a mote of dust in a perfect vacuum, timeless and placeless. The fear that had been his constant companion was gone too, for fear required a body to feel it, a future to dread. Here, there was only a disembodied, eternal now. He did not know if a second or a century passed in that un-place.

Then, as suddenly as it had been taken, the universe was returned to him, but it was a different universe entirely. Sensation bloomed not from the outside in, but from the inside out. A soft, pearlescent light bloomed behind his eyelids before he had realised he had eyes to open. The air that filled his lungs was warm, dry, and smelled of something he had no name for—a scent like warm stone, exotic resins, and the clean, static tang of a distant thunderstorm. Sound returned not as the howling wind of the summit, but as a low, intricate hum, a complex symphony of a million tiny, precise movements: the whisper of polished metal on stone, the crystalline chime of glass being shaped, the soft thrum of what could only be looms, vast and yet impossibly delicate. He opened his eyes and his breath, which he now possessed again, caught in his throat.

He stood on a wide, stone ledge in a cavern so immense it defied all sense of scale. It was not a natural cave, but a geode of impossible proportions, its vaulted ceiling lost in a soft, self-generated twilight. The walls were not bare rock but were carved into a million niches, ledges, and spiraling staircases, all interconnected by delicate, web-like bridges. And everywhere, there were threads. Countless luminous filaments, finer than spider-silk and glowing with a soft, internal silver-gold light, crisscrossed the immense space, running from the highest vaults to the deepest pits. Some were taut and pulsed with a steady, rhythmic light. Others were slack and dim, their glow flickering like a dying candle. A few were utterly dark, and he saw, with a jolt of recognition, that they were frayed at the ends. It was the Loom of Ages, not as a metaphor, but as a physical, tangible, and breathtaking reality. He was inside the machine.

Dozens of goblins moved with quiet, focused purpose throughout the vast space. They were unlike any goblins he had ever seen. Clad in simple, functional tunics of a dark, undyed cloth, they were artisans of a supreme order. One, perched on a scaffold of what looked like polished bone, worked to re-splice a dimming thread with a tool that dripped liquid light. Another sat before a vast, crystalline lens, her fingers dancing over a console of glowing runes, her eyes fixed on a distant entanglement of filaments. On a lower level, a team of three worked in perfect unison to re-tension a section of the Loom, their movements a silent ballet of collaborative effort. This was not a hideout or a sanctuary; it was a workshop, a hospital, a cathedral dedicated to the art of mending reality itself. Pau looked down at his own grimy, torn clothes, his satchel of scavenged scraps, and felt a wave of crushing inadequacy. He was a grubby child who had wandered into a conclave of gods.

“The journey wears on the thread as much as the weaver.” The voice was ancient, calm, and resonant, like the slow grinding of tectonic plates. Pau turned to see an old goblin approaching him on the ledge. He was stooped with age, his skin the texture of old parchment, and his eyes, deep-set and intelligent, were the colour of polished river stones. He carried no tools, but his hands were stained with a dozen colours Pau had never seen, chemical and mineral hues that spoke of a lifetime of arcane craft. “Pau de la Boqueria. The mosaic-maker. Your thread sang of your arrival long before your feet touched this stone. Welcome to the Heartwood.”

The old goblin, who introduced himself as Silas, reached out a hand, not to shake Pau’s, but towards the satchel. “You have carried your burdens far enough. They will be tended to.” Pau hesitated for a moment, clutching the satchel that held the last remnants of his old life. But the calm authority in Silas’s eyes was absolute. Slowly, he handed over the heavy leather bag. Silas took it, his gaze falling on the coffee can peeking out. “Ah, a messenger’s echo. We will need to listen to its silence.” He then held out his hand for the spindle. Pau relinquished it, and as it left his grasp, he felt a strange lightness, as if a weight he hadn't known he was carrying had been lifted from his soul. Silas held the spindle up, the single thread of light pulsing in the dim cavern. “A strong thread,” he murmured, a hint of approval in his tone. “Tempered by fear and solitude. Good. It will be resilient.”

Pau found his voice, a rough, dry rasp. “That thing… the hunter in the tunnels, on the mountain…” Silas’s gaze met his, and for the first time, a flicker of something ancient and weary crossed his face. “The Unravellers. Constructs of entropy. They are drawn to fraying threads, seeking to sever them completely. They cannot enter this place, but they will be waiting beyond its borders. Your arrival was… noted.” He turned, gesturing for Pau to follow him along the wide ledge towards a passage carved into the cavern wall. “You have passed the test of the journey. You have proven you have the will to mend. But will is not enough. Now, your education begins.” He led Pau away from the breathtaking spectacle of the Loom, towards the warren of workshops and dormitories hidden within the walls. For the first time in his life, Pau was not in the cracks of a world, but at its very core, and he had never felt so small.The tunnel Silas led him into was a deliberate architectural statement. The raw, god-sized majesty of the Great Loom cavern was left behind, and the passage became a smooth, perfectly cylindrical corridor, carved from the living rock with an impossible precision. The air lost its grand, resonant hum, replaced by a focused quiet, and the diffuse, pearlescent light gave way to glowing sigils set into the walls at regular intervals, casting a steady, functional luminescence. Pau’s bare feet, so accustomed to the filth and unevenness of sewer ledges and muddy riverbanks, were unnerved by the flawless, clean surface beneath them. It was a place without grit, without decay, without history. It felt profoundly, unnervingly un-goblin. He had always understood his kind as creatures of the earth's rough draft—its cracks, its forgotten corners, its messy, decaying processes. This place was the finished manuscript, edited and bound and utterly sterile.

They stopped before a shallow alcove carved into the corridor wall. It was to be his living space. A smooth stone slab, slightly raised, served as a bed. A smaller niche was carved above it for possessions. There was nothing else. No repurposed detritus, no comforting clutter, no layers of insulation against the damp. The stark emptiness of it was a physical blow. His warren had been a reflection of him, a three-dimensional journal of his life, every object a word, every arrangement a sentence. This was a blank page. A cell. He felt the phantom weight of his collection, the jar of mismatched buttons, the tangle of copper wire, the glorious trove of broken tiles, and a wave of homesickness so potent it made him dizzy. He was not just homeless; he was, in a fundamental way, becoming unmade.

Silas seemed to perceive his distress, his ancient river-stone eyes missing nothing. "In the overworld, you built a self from what was discarded," the old goblin said, his voice soft but firm. "It was a necessary armour. Here, the self is not a fortress to be decorated, but a tool to be honed. Your work on the Loom will be your collage now. The mending of what is broken will become your only necessary possession." He gestured to the empty niche. "Rest. When you have gathered your thoughts, join us in the refectory. The rhythm of this place is important. It is the first thread you must learn to follow." With that, he turned and continued his silent, gliding walk down the corridor, leaving Pau alone in the crushing void of his new home. He did not rest. He stood for a long time in the centre of the alcove, a solitary, grimy statue, his hand deep in his pocket, his fingers wrapped tightly around the one, sharp-edged secret he still owned.

The refectory was another vast, carved space, but this one was filled with a low, vaulted ceiling that seemed to absorb sound. Long, immaculately clean stone tables were arranged in neat rows, occupied by dozens of goblins eating in a state of near-total silence. It was not an awkward silence, but a comfortable, shared quiet of deep concentration. As Pau entered behind Silas, heads turned. He saw no hostility in their gazes, but a deep, unnerving curiosity. Their eyes, in a hundred shades of mineral colour, assessed him, catalogued him, measured him. He was the surface-dweller, the mosaic-maker, an anomaly brought in from the chaotic, decaying world they held at bay. He felt like one of his own found objects being held up to the light, appraised for its potential use. The food, ladled from a steaming cauldron, was a thick, pale gruel made from colossal, subterranean fungi and the ground pith of certain luminous mosses. It was warm and nourishing, but it had no distinct flavour, no joy, no memory. It was fuel. He ate with his head bowed, the posture of a lifetime of hiding, and felt the weight of their collective gaze, a silent pressure that was heavier than any stone.

After the meal, Silas led him not back to the Great Loom, but down a spiralling staircase into a smaller, quieter workshop. The air here was still and focused. In the centre of the room, on a vast, circular table of polished black stone that seemed to drink the light, lay a single thread. It was about six feet long, grey, and utterly devoid of the light that characterized the threads of the Loom. It was slack and dead, like a piece of old twine. In its centre was a distinct, ugly break, its two ends frayed and lifeless. Pau felt a pang of something like pity for the pathetic, broken thing.

"This is your first lesson," Silas said, his voice a low murmur. He gestured towards the thread with a long, elegant finger. "This was the life-thread of a fisherman from a village you have never heard of, near the mouth of the Ebro. He drowned yesterday, his net tangled in an old wreck during a sudden squall. A simple life, a good life. But his end was abrupt, a tear rather than a gentle unspooling. The story is damaged." He looked at Pau, his gaze intense. "We do not simply patch the Loom. To do so would create a scar, a point of weakness. We must heal the thread itself. We must understand the life it was, the story it told, from beginning to end. Only then can its light be rekindled and the break be made whole, ready to be woven back into the grand pattern. We have no tools for this task but our own focus. Your work begins now. Listen to the thread, Pau de la Boqueria. Find its story." Silas placed a hand briefly on Pau's shoulder, a touch as light as a falling leaf, and then he was gone, leaving Pau alone with the dead man's life.

Pau stood before the table for what felt like an hour, staring at the inert, grey filament. Listen to it? It was absurd. It was a piece of string. He reached out and touched it. The texture was smooth, cool, and unresponsive. It told him nothing. He was a creature of the tangible, of texture and colour and weight. His art was in the juxtaposition of physical fragments, in seeing how a piece of broken plate could become an eye, how a sliver of green glass could become a wave. This was formless, abstract nonsense. Frustration coiled in his gut. He had survived the hunter, crossed the plains, climbed the mountain, for *this*? To be left alone in a dark room and told to have a conversation with a corpse's metaphysical tail? His hand instinctively went to the shard in his pocket, its sharp edges a comforting, solid reality. He could understand that shard. He knew its history, its context, its potential. This thread was a blank, mocking enigma.

He closed his eyes, forcing the frustration down. He remembered Silas’s words: *Find its story.* He tried to approach it as a problem of mosaic. He saw the break, the void. What was missing? What shape was the hole? But there was no shape, only an ending. He tried to think of the fisherman. He pictured the sea, a place he knew only by its salt taste on the sardines and the distant glimmer from the hills. He imagined a boat, a net, a storm. He built a picture in his mind, a mosaic of second-hand knowledge. Nothing happened. The thread remained grey and dead. He sighed, a puff of weary breath in the silent room. He was a failure. He was the wrong choice. He was just a goblin who was good at gluing down trash. Defeated, he let his mind go blank, his focus softening. And in that moment of surrender, as he simply rested his fingers on the thread without expectation, something shifted. It was not a sound, not a vision, but a feeling. A faint, phantom sensation in his own hands—the rough, calloused texture of a rope slipping through them, the memory of a lifetime of hauling nets. It was a ghost of a sensation, fleeting and faint, but it was there. The thread had spoken its first word.That first touch of another’s reality was as faint and fleeting as the scent of rain on a hot stone. Pau chased it. Forgetting the grand, impossible task, he focused only on that single, ghostly echo. He laid his hands flat on the stone table, his fingertips resting gently on the inert thread, and let his own senses fall away. He did not try to see or hear, but to feel. It was like pressing his ear to a vast, stone wall, trying to discern the vibrations of a world on the other side. Slowly, painstakingly, the fragments began to arrive, not as a coherent story, but as a scattering of sensory dust. The sharp, abrasive texture of a dried salt crust on his knuckles. The rhythmic, jarring slap of a wooden hull against choppy water. The dull, persistent ache in his lower back from a lifetime of leaning and pulling. The sudden, shocking cold of a rogue wave splashing over the gunwale.

These were not memories, not yet. They were raw data, physical impressions stripped of context. They were like the unsorted piles of detritus he used to collect, a jumble of unrelated colours and textures. He felt the blinding glare of a midday sun on an endless expanse of blue, and a moment later, the damp, clinging chill of a pre-dawn fog. He felt the satisfying weight of a full net, heavy with the promise of a good sale, followed by the slick, unpleasant feeling of gutting a fish, the knife handle slippery with blood and scales. He was collecting the fisherman’s tiles, but he had no pattern, no mortar, no vision of the final image. The sensations came and went without logic, a chaotic storm of another man’s life washing over him, leaving him feeling disoriented and nauseated. He was drowning in a sea of broken pieces.

Days bled into one another in the timeless twilight of the Heartwood. His routine was simple and monastic: he would be woken by a soft chime he could feel in his bones, he would go to the refectory and silently consume the flavourless, nourishing gruel, and then he would return to the workshop and his inert, grey thread. The other goblins moved around him with a serene purpose he found both admirable and infuriating. He saw them working on threads that blazed with complex light or were tangled in knots of such intricate darkness that they seemed to be staring into the heart of a dying star. And here he was, failing at the most basic of tasks, a kindergarten student in a university of gods. The frustration was a hard, bitter knot in his stomach. During one particularly maddening session where the thread gave him nothing but a monotonous, unchanging ache in his phantom shoulder, he slammed his fist on the stone table, a crack of sound that was an act of blasphemy in the sacred quiet. He tore his hand away from the thread, his breath coming in ragged gasps, and his fingers, by pure instinct, dug into his pocket and closed around the shard of Gaudí's glaze. The feel of its sharp, familiar edges, the memory of its solid, physical beauty, was an anchor. This was real. This had weight and history and form. This worthless grey string was a lie, a trick, a madness.

He sat back, clutching the shard, ready to abandon the entire enterprise, to walk out of the workshop and declare himself a fraud. But as he stared at the frayed break in the thread, his artist’s eye, the part of him that was more fundamental than his fear or frustration, saw something new. He wasn't looking at a broken string. He was looking at a gap in a pattern. It was the same as in his mosaic, when a space would be left, a hole in the story of his sleeping city. He would not just fill it with any random piece; he would study the edges of the void. He would discern the shape of what was missing by observing what remained. He had been trying to force the thread to give him the whole story at once, but that wasn't how mosaics were made. They were built piece by piece, each one informing the placement of the next. He had the pieces; he just had to find their order.

With a new, calmer resolve, he put the shard back in his pocket. It had served its purpose, reminding him of who he was: an artist of fragments. He returned to the thread, but with a different question. He rested his fingers near one of the frayed ends—the end of the life. He did not ask for the whole story. He asked, with the focused intent of a craftsman, "What came just before this?" He focused on the raw sensation of the break, the ghost of a sudden, violent tearing. He held that sensation in his mind, and then he let his focus drift backwards, searching not for a random memory, but for the specific sensation that preceded the tear. And it came. The feeling of being submerged, of icy water filling his lungs, a desperate, clawing panic. He had found the adjacent tile. He followed it backwards again. Before the drowning? The shock of falling into the water. Before that? A lurching deck, a sudden, violent gust of wind, the boat tipping precariously. He was no longer just receiving sensations; he was arranging them. He was tracing the story backwards from its tragic end.

Once he had a sequence, a narrative spine, the rest of the life began to cling to it, like iron filings to a magnet. He discovered the fisherman's name was Ramon. He felt Ramon’s youth, the sun-warmed joy of learning to swim in the shallows of the Ebro delta, his father’s rough, kind hands guiding him. He felt the shy, terrifying thrill of his first kiss with a girl named Elena, her name a taste of wild figs on his tongue. He experienced the birth of their son, not as an observer, but feeling the crushing anxiety of waiting outside the room, and then the boundless, heart-stopping love as he held the tiny, squalling infant for the first time. He felt the quiet satisfaction of mending a net with his son years later, seeing his own father's lessons passed down, a thread of knowledge connecting three generations. He felt the bitter arguments over money, the quiet reconciliations in the dark, the shared grief over a failed harvest, the simple, profound joy of a family meal on a summer evening. Pau was no longer just a listener; he was a witness. He was walking through the mosaic of another goblin’s soul, seeing how every piece, bright or dark, joyous or painful, fit together to create the whole.

He lived through dozens of storms, feeling the fear and the exhilaration, the trust in his small, sturdy boat, the intimate knowledge of the sea’s moods. He came to understand that Ramon’s life was not defined by its end, but by a thousand small acts of resilience and love. Finally, he returned to the last day, no longer as a chaotic jumble of sensations, but as the final, inevitable panel of the story. He felt Ramon’s weariness that morning, the deeper ache in his bones. He felt his brief moment of pride as a particularly large catch of sea bass filled his nets. And he felt the storm's arrival, not as a surprise, but as a familiar foe that had simply, this one time, been stronger and faster than he was. As he relived the final moments, the cold, the panic, the entanglement in the very nets that had provided his livelihood, Pau felt a new sensation emerge from beneath the terror: a strange, sad flicker of acceptance. A final thought of Elena, of his son, a last, silent apology, and then, a peaceful letting go. He had found the last fragment. The story was complete.

Pau opened his eyes, tears he hadn't realised he was crying streaking through the grime on his face. The workshop was silent and still. He was back in his own body, but he was not the same. He carried another life within him now, a story told and understood. He looked at the grey, broken thread, and it no longer looked pathetic or inert. It looked like a sacred relic, a story waiting for its conclusion to be honored. He gently picked up the two frayed ends, one in each hand. He did not know the mechanics of what he was supposed to do, but his artistic instincts took over. He held the complete, vibrant mosaic of Ramon’s life in his mind—every joy, every sorrow, every storm, every quiet moment of love. He focused it all, a lifetime of meaning and memory, into the empty space between his hands. He poured not just the story, but his own profound respect for it, into the gap.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a single spark of pale, golden light flickered in the centre of the break. The light pulsed, and with each pulse, it grew, flowing down the thread in both directions. The dull grey receded, consumed by a warm, sun-bleached gold, the colour of a worn sail in the late afternoon. The frayed fibres at the break danced and wove themselves together, not like a patch, but like a healing wound, knitting into a seamless whole that left no scar, no mark of the trauma it had endured. The thread, now whole and glowing with a soft, steady light, pulsed in his hands with a gentle, living warmth. He had done it. He had not just repaired a thing; he had restored a story. He had taken the broken pieces of a life and made them beautiful and whole again, not by adding anything new, but by understanding what was already there. It was the most profound piece of art he had ever created. He stared at the glowing thread, a line of pure, quiet meaning, and for the first time since leaving his warren, he felt a sense of purpose that had nothing to do with what he had lost, and everything to do with what he was beginning to find.The light from the mended thread was not a harsh glare, but a soft, warm radiance that filled the small workshop with the gentle glow of a sun-drenched afternoon. It pulsed in Pau’s hands with a slow, steady rhythm, the beat of a contented heart. He felt a deep, bone-weary exhaustion, as if he had run all the way from Barcelona again, but it was coupled with a profound sense of rightness, a craftsman's satisfaction that was deeper and more resonant than anything he had ever felt before. He had not just arranged broken pieces into a pleasing pattern; he had resurrected a story from its own ashes. He had given a forgotten life its meaning back, and in doing so, had found a flicker of new meaning for his own.

The stone door to the workshop slid open with a whisper, and Silas entered. The old goblin’s eyes went first to the glowing thread, and a long, slow breath escaped his lips, a sound of ancient affirmation. He did not smile, for smiles were a currency of the overworld, but his gaze, when it met Pau’s, held a new quality, a quiet acknowledgement that was more potent than any praise. He had not been a student taking a test; he had been an apprentice presenting his first masterwork.

“It is whole,” Silas stated, the two words a complete and final judgment. He approached the table and held out his hands. Pau reverently placed the mended thread into them. Silas held it for a moment, his head cocked as if listening to a faint melody, then he nodded once, a sharp, decisive movement. “The pattern will accept it. The story is true again.” He turned, not towards the exit, but towards a different passage, one Pau had not noticed before. “Your time in the quiet rooms is over. The Loom awaits your hand.”

Following Silas was a different experience this time. Pau walked with a straighter back, his exhaustion a proud burden rather than a mark of defeat. They emerged back into the Great Loom cavern, and the sheer scale of it, which had once terrified him, now filled him with a sense of awe and purpose. He was no longer a trespasser. This was his workshop now. The hum of a million destinies filled the air, and for the first time, he could discern individual notes within the symphony: a bright, trilling arpeggio of a new life beginning, a deep, mournful cello note of a peaceful passing, a frantic, discordant jangle of a life in crisis. His experience with Ramon’s thread had tuned his senses, given him the language to begin to comprehend the incomprehensible.

Silas led him onto one of the delicate, web-like bridges that traversed the vast space. It seemed too fragile to hold his weight, but it was as solid as the mountain itself. Far below, luminous filaments plunged into darkness, and far above, they ascended into the pearlescent twilight. He saw other Menders at their stations, some perched on impossibly high ledges, others suspended in crystalline pods, all lost in the deep meditation of their work. They arrived at a small, circular platform that jutted out from the cavern wall, a lonely island in a sea of threads. This, Silas indicated with a sweep of his hand, was to be Pau's place.

“Every Mender has a section of the Loom for which they are responsible,” Silas explained, his voice low to compete with the ever-present hum. “A current of reality they must tend to. This is yours.” He pointed, and Pau followed his gaze to a section of the tapestry just beyond the platform’s edge. It was not a single, broken thread. It was a tangle. Two threads were wrapped around each other in a desperate, suffocating embrace. One was a soft, warm rose-gold, its light pulsing with a frantic, irregular rhythm like a terrified heart. It was wrapped so tightly around the other thread, a thin, fragile filament of pale, luminous silver, that it seemed to be strangling it. The silver thread was dim, its light flickering weakly, and where the two threads were most tightly knotted, a dark, bruised-purple colour had spread, a blight of shared pain that was draining the life from both.

“A mother and her unborn child,” Silas murmured, his voice heavy with sorrow. “The mother’s thread is strong, but it is knotted with fear. A difficult birth, the healers of her village are uncertain. Her fear, her fierce and desperate love, is a knot so tight it is stifling the child’s thread before it has a chance to truly shine. Her desire to protect is becoming an act of destruction. This is not a simple break to be mended, Pau. This is an entanglement that must be gently persuaded to release. To pull on one thread is to tighten the other. To cut one is to kill both.”

Pau stared at the tragic knot, his heart clenching in his chest. The simple, linear narrative of Ramon’s life was a world away from this complex, living crisis. He could feel the panic radiating from the rose-gold thread, a mother’s primal terror of loss. He could feel the faint, struggling pulse of the silver thread, a life drowning before it could draw its first breath. This was not a mosaic to be reassembled from the past. This was a sculpture to be carved from a present that was actively, violently, going wrong. His previous success felt small, a child’s clumsy repair job in the face of this profound and delicate tragedy. He reached out a trembling hand, his fingers hovering over the knot, daunted by the impossible delicacy of the task. He was an artist of the broken, the discarded, the finished. How could he possibly mend a story that was still being written?His hands, which had just learned the steady confidence of mending, trembled above the living knot. The work on Ramon’s thread had been an act of archaeology, a careful reconstruction of a finished life from its fossilised remains. This was vivisection. The rose-gold thread throbbed with a raw, animal panic that flooded his senses, a screaming, wordless terror that was so potent it felt like his own. He could feel the desperate, suffocating love of the mother, a love so fierce it had become a garrote. He was a goblin of the junkyard and the morgue, a connoisseur of endings. He knew nothing of this, the terrible, violent, and sacred business of beginnings. The vastness of the Loom cavern seemed to press in on him, and the weight of this single, intimate crisis felt heavier than the entire mountain he had climbed.

He tried, at first, to apply the lesson he had just learned. Closing his eyes, he reached out with his mind and attempted to listen to the story of the fear, to understand its narrative shape. But there was no shape, no story. It was a vortex, a feedback loop of pure, chaotic emotion. The mother’s fear fed on itself, imagining every possible horror, and with each imagined tragedy, the knot tightened, squeezing the life from the frail silver thread of the child. Pau felt the knot physically constrict under his focus, the bruised purple darkening, the silver thread dimming to a barely perceptible flicker. A wave of horrified adrenaline shot through him. He snatched his hands back as if burned. He had almost extinguished them both. His clumsy attempt to understand had amplified the pain, his very attention acting as a poison.

Recoiling to the edge of the small platform, his heart hammered against his ribs. He was a fool. A blunt instrument sent to perform microsurgery. He stared at the desperate, pulsing knot, his own panic mirroring the mother’s. He had failed. He was going to sit here and watch two lives unravel because he was unequal to the task. His gaze fell to his own hands, calloused and grimy, and he thought of his mosaic. When he came across a section of his sleeping city that was disharmonious, where the colours clashed and the lines fought each other, he didn't just force them together. He would step back, reassess. Sometimes, the problem wasn't with the pieces themselves, but with their arrangement. Sometimes, what was needed wasn’t pressure, but a new perspective, a different kind of light. He couldn’t fight the fear head-on; it was too strong, too self-sustaining. He had to go around it.

With a new, fragile strategy forming in his mind, he approached the Loom again. This time, he did not touch the knot. He reached for the mother’s rose-gold thread further back, before the fear had begun its suffocating work. He let his senses drift along the filament, moving backwards through the story of the pregnancy. He passed through weeks of anxiety, morning sickness, and discomfort, searching for a moment of purity, a single, unbroken tile of a different emotional colour. He found it. A memory from months ago, a quiet evening when the mother had been resting, her hands on her belly. And for the first time, she had felt it: not a kick, but a gentle, liquid flutter, a tiny, secret signal from another soul. Pau seized upon the sensation. It was a perfect, incandescent moment of pure connection, of sublime and private joy, untainted by the fear that would come later. It was the emotional seed from which all her love had grown.

He held that memory in his focus, cupping it as carefully as he would a living flame. He did not try to banish the fear or attack the knot. He simply brought the glowing shard of joy close to the raging storm of panic. He presented the feeling to the thread. With the full force of his empathic will, he offered the mother’s terrified heart a perfect reflection of itself, a reminder of the love that predated the fear. He projected a single, silent message into the chaos, a truth she had forgotten: *This is also you. This hope is the anchor. This love is the reason.* He wasn't fighting the darkness; he was turning on a light. He was creating a mosaic not of the past, but of a possible future, using the most beautiful and resilient tile he could find in the mother’s own story.

The effect was not immediate or dramatic. It was a slow, painful uncoiling. The frantic, screaming pulse of the rose-gold thread faltered. A single, steady beat entered its rhythm, then another. The storm of fear did not vanish, but a space of calm opened in its eye. The mother, in her distant village, must have taken a single, deep breath, a moment of unexplainable peace descending upon her. As her panic subsided, the knot of her love began to loosen its death grip. The bruised purple colour paled, and the suffocating pressure eased. The frail silver thread, freed from its prison, flickered once, twice, and then its light swelled, not to a blaze, but to a thin, stable, and wonderfully persistent silver flame.

Pau slumped back, every muscle in his body trembling with a profound, soul-deep exhaustion. The effort of holding that single, perfect emotion against the tide of raw terror had drained him completely. He had not been a craftsman imposing his will, but a conduit, pouring his own essence into the gap to create a moment of clarity. He looked at the two threads. They were still entwined, a soft, rose-gold filament now gently cradling a steady silver one. The knot had transformed into an embrace. The immediate danger had passed. He had not fixed a break; he had mediated a crisis, guided a story back from the brink. He looked at his own hands, seeing them in a new light. They were not just the hands of an artist who worked with the dead and the broken. They were the hands of a tender, a guide, a quiet persuader of living things. And as he stared at the fragile, harmonious dance of the two threads, a single, devastatingly simple truth settled into the core of his being: this was a greater work than any mosaic he could ever conceive.The deep, cellular exhaustion that followed was a physical presence, a heavy blanket woven from psychic exertion and spent adrenaline. Pau remained on the small, circular platform for a long time, his legs too weak to support him, his gaze fixed on the two threads now glowing in a gentle, harmonious rhythm. The rose-gold and the silver filaments danced around each other in a slow, graceful orbit, a perfect visual metaphor for the quiet peace he had helped to broker. The sight was a balm, a quiet reward that resonated deeper than any scavenged treasure. He had not just prevented a death; he had protected a bond. He had reinforced the very weave of love against the tearing force of fear. This act of creation, of nurturing, felt more significant than the entirety of his meticulously assembled mosaic. His life’s work, the sleeping city on the cistern wall, felt like a beautiful but static monument to the past, while this single, shimmering embrace of threads felt like a prayer for the future.

When he finally found the strength to rise and make his way back to the refectory, the atmosphere was different. The silence was the same, the focused consumption of the bland, nourishing gruel unchanged, but the gazes that met his were not of simple curiosity. He saw in the mineral-hued eyes of the other Menders a new, profound respect. A goblin with skin the colour of slate, who was known to work on the tangled, violent threads of war and politics, gave him a slow, deliberate nod. Another, a tiny, ancient female whose hands were permanently stained with the luminous cobalt of dying stars, met his eye and briefly inclined her head. These were not grand gestures, but in the silent, focused world of the Heartwood, they were declarations. He was no longer the oddity from the surface. He was a Mender who had shown them a different way, a goblin who had brought the gentle, patient art of the mosaic-maker to the living, screaming heart of the Loom. He had not used force or arcane law, but empathy. He had not commanded the threads; he had reminded them of their own best story.

Later, as he sat in the stark emptiness of his alcove, the profound satisfaction began to be undercut by a familiar, hollow ache. The quiet approval of his new peers was a comfort, but it was the comfort of a barracks, not the chaotic, personal warmth of a home. He reached into his pocket and his fingers closed around the Gaudí shard. He pulled it out, its iridescent gleam a small, defiant spark of his old world in the sterile light of his new one. He was proud of the work he had done, of the lives he had touched in some unseen village, but the pride did not erase the loss. He was still an exile. He ran his thumb over the shard’s smooth, curved surface, a piece of a life he had built from the fragments of others. Now he was building a new life, a new self, but the raw materials were not the comfortable, solid refuse of the world he knew, but the terrifyingly abstract and emotionally draining filaments of fate itself.

“It is a beautiful fragment.” Silas’s voice, quiet as it was, made Pau jump. The old goblin stood at the entrance to his alcove, his river-stone eyes fixed on the shard in Pau’s hand. “A piece of the overworld’s chaotic, accidental beauty. You carry it as an anchor to the goblin you were.” Pau closed his fist around the shard, a reflexive, protective gesture. Silas’s gaze was not accusatory. “Do not mistake me. Anchors are necessary. But you must understand that the nature of the sea you are sailing has changed. The work you did today, Pau, was exceptional. You did not just mend; you harmonized. This is a rare gift, even here. But such acts do not go unnoticed. A mending of that intensity, a reclamation of two lives from the edge of the void, creates a resonance. It is a flare of order in the chaos, a lighthouse lit in a dark and hungry sea. You have announced yourself not just to us, but to the Unravellers.”

A cold dread, familiar and unwelcome, seeped back into Pau’s bones. He thought of the scraping, metallic hunter in the sewers, its cold green lens sweeping the darkness. “They know I am here?” he rasped. “They can find this place?” “The Heartwood is shielded,” Silas assured him, though his tone did little to comfort. “But your light now shines brightly within it. They cannot enter, but they can see the lighthouse. And they will gather outside its walls. They will batter it. Your success has made you a priority target, and by extension, you have made us all a more tempting prize.” The old goblin’s expression grew grave. He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a near-whisper, a current of urgency flowing beneath the calm surface. “The Unravellers are not mindless constructs of entropy. That is a simplification we allow for novices. They are agents of a rival philosophy. They believe the Loom is not a sacred tapestry but a prison, that fate is a tyrant, and that every choice, every life, is merely a predetermined path on a map drawn by a senile god. They do not see themselves as destroyers, but as liberators. They seek to grant the universe the ultimate freedom: the freedom of non-existence. And they have found a focus for their efforts.”

Silas gestured, and the air between them shimmered. An image resolved itself in the glowing light, an image of a section of the Loom so complex it made Pau’s head spin. It was not a few tangled threads, but a nexus of thousands, a sunburst of destinies woven into a single, colossal knot of pure, foundational power. At its very heart, a single, brilliant thread of pure, white-gold light pulsed with the slow, steady rhythm of a continent’s heart. “This is a Keystone,” Silas explained. “One of the primary anchors that holds the entire pattern of this age in place. It is the life-thread of the mountain itself, the ancient intelligence of Montserrat. The Unravellers have been weakening it for centuries, subtly, patiently. They are preparing a final, decisive blow. If it is severed, this entire quadrant of the Loom will unravel into chaos. The Heartwood will be exposed. The world above will suffer a cataclysm it cannot comprehend.”

The image shimmered, and Pau saw dark, cancerous shadows creeping along the threads leading to the Keystone, the tell-tale bruising of the Unravellers’ touch. The scale of it was overwhelming, a crisis that made the mother and child’s plight seem like a splinter. “We cannot approach it directly,” Silas continued. “Our methods of mending are too slow, and the Keystone’s own energy field is too powerful for us to work on it safely. But your unique gift, the art of persuasion, of reminding, of introducing a resonant truth to counter a lie… it may be the only thing that can halt the decay. We need you to go to the Keystone, Pau. We need you to speak to the heart of the mountain, to remind it of its own strength, to help it cast off the Unravellers’ poison before they can strike their final blow.” The mission hung in the air, an impossible weight. He was to be a field medic for a god, a psychologist for a mountain. He was Pau de la Boqueria. He collected trash. He looked from the terrifying image of the dying Keystone to the small, solid shard of tile in his hand, a fragment of a human’s dream of beauty that had become his own. He was just a goblin who knew how to put broken pieces together. Perhaps, he thought with a surge of grim, terrifying resolve, that was exactly what the heart of a dying mountain needed.The journey to the Keystone was a descent into the very grammar of existence. Silas led Pau away from the familiar ledges and bridges, onto a barely-there path that spiraled downwards, hugging the colossal, curved wall of the cavern. As they descended, the character of the Loom changed. The neatly organized, shimmering filaments of individual lives and local events gave way to thicker, more substantial cables of light—the life-threads of species, of languages, of entire ecosystems. These threads hummed with a power so profound it was a physical pressure, a constant, low-frequency vibration that Pau felt in his teeth and bones. The air grew heavy, saturated with the raw energy of creation, and the pearlescent twilight of the upper cavern was replaced by a more primal, elemental glow from the massive threads themselves. Pau saw the life-thread of the Iberian wolf, a braided cord of silver and grey, pulsing with a fierce, wild, and sadly diminishing light. He saw the thread of the Catalan language, a vibrant, complex tapestry of gold and crimson that had been frayed and nearly severed centuries ago, only to be painstakingly mended into a form even stronger than the original. He was walking through a museum of being, and the weight of it all pressed down on him, a crushing testament to how much there was to lose.

They passed through zones of strange, aborted realities, where the Loom had experimented and failed. Here, threads led nowhere, ending in crystalline explosions of frozen potential or tangles of black, cancerous growth that Menders had quarantined behind shimmering walls of force. Pau saw a thread that felt of creatures who swam in stone, another of a sky with two suns, all of them failed drafts of the world, now silent and dark. It was a sobering lesson: the Loom was not infallible. The order it maintained was a constant, desperate struggle against a tide of chaos and entropy that was always waiting at the edges. The Unravellers were not just attacking the present; they were preying on the fundamental fragility of existence itself. This was no longer about art or craft; it was about survival on a scale he could barely comprehend. His previous successes, the mending of Ramon’s life and the soothing of the mother’s fear, felt like a child’s sandcastles built in the path of a tsunami.

Finally, they arrived at a vast, flat shelf of obsidian-like rock at the bottom of the cavern, a dark shore lapped by a sea of foundational power. This was the antechamber to the Keystone. The air here was electric, buzzing with a tension that made the hairs on Pau’s arms stand on end. Before them, the nexus of the Keystone was a blinding sun of tangled light, too bright to look at directly, yet Pau could feel its pain, a deep, groaning agony that was the tectonic expression of despair. The area around it was a battleground. Dozens of Menders stood in silent, unwavering vigil, their forms silhouetted against the terrible light. They were not mending. They were acting as living shields, their bodies and wills formed into a barrier against the encroaching darkness. Pau could see the darkness now, not as a simple shadow, but as an active, corrosive void, a creeping nothingness that flaked away at the edges of reality, turning threads of pure light into black, lifeless dust that drifted into the abyss. The sentinels held it back, but Pau could see the immense strain, the way their own light flickered and dimmed with the effort. They were a dam holding back an ocean of oblivion, and it was beginning to crack.

Silas stopped, his face a grim mask in the churning light. “This is as far as I can go,” he said, his voice barely a whisper above the roar of the Keystone. “The final approach must be yours alone. The sentinels will protect you from the direct assault of the void, but they cannot shield you from the Keystone’s own despair, nor from the Unravellers’ philosophy that now poisons it.” He placed a hand on Pau’s shoulder, his grip surprisingly strong, anchoring him against the psychic tempest. “Remember your art, mosaic-maker. You are not there to fight. You are not strong enough. You are there to remind. The mountain has lived for eons. Its memory is deep. It has felt the sun and the ice, the birth of forests and the death of glaciers. It has been a fortress, a sanctuary, and a silent witness. Its story is one of endurance. The Unravellers are trying to make it forget that story, to convince it that its only truth is its eventual erosion into dust. You must find the pieces of its true story, the moments of its deepest strength and meaning, and hold them up for it to see. Build it a mirror from its own best self. Let the mountain remember its own name.”

Without another word, Silas stepped back to join the line of sentinels, his own light flaring as he added his will to the great shield. Pau was alone, standing at the edge of a precipice, facing a dying god. He took a single, shaky step forward, past the line of defence, and the full force of the crisis hit him. It was a voice, not of sound, but of pure, insidious thought that bloomed directly in his mind. *It is pointless.* The voice was calm, rational, and utterly persuasive. *Every stone you place will be ground to sand. Every life you save will end. Every star will burn out. This struggle, this effort, this pain… it is a temporary vanity. Only the end is real. Only the silence is eternal. Surrender. Let go. Is the quiet not a relief?* The nihilism was a seductive poison, a sweet song of despair that promised an end to all struggle. It resonated with every loss Pau had ever felt, every moment of loneliness in his dark warren, every pang of exile. For a terrifying second, he felt his resolve crumble. The voice was right. Why bother?

His hand, of its own accord, clenched in his pocket. His fingers closed around the Gaudí shard. He felt its sharp edges, its cool, smooth curve. It was a fragment of a human’s defiant dream, an artist’s audacious, glorious, and perhaps ultimately futile, scream of beauty against the void. It was pointless, maybe. But it was also beautiful. And the act of creating it, of preserving it, of loving it, was a meaning in itself. The whispers receded, baffled by this simple, illogical truth. His purpose was not to argue with the void, but to build something in spite of it. Bracing himself, he took another step towards the blinding pillar of wounded light. He was Pau de la Boqueria. He was a mender of broken things. And the heart of the mountain was the greatest, most beautiful, most broken thing he had ever seen. He reached out his hands, not to fight, but to feel for the first piece of his mosaic.Stepping past the psychic demarcation line of the sentinels was like plunging his head into a furnace of pure despair. The voice was everywhere, a patient, venomous whisper that coiled around his thoughts, but the direct touch of the Keystone was something else entirely. It was not a single entity’s mind, but a geological consciousness, a library of time so vast it had no concept of narrative. As Pau laid his trembling hands upon the nearest great cable of light leading to the central knot, his own brief, century-long life was instantly rendered meaningless. He was assaulted by the weight of a billion years, the crushing, slow-motion violence of tectonic uplift, the patient grinding of glaciers that sheared away its face like a careless chisel, the searing heat and bone-cracking cold of ten thousand seasons. These were not memories in any sense he understood; they were strata of pure sensation, an agony of existence so prolonged it had forgotten it was pain and simply accepted it as the state of being. And within this immense, dispassionate suffering, the Unravellers’ philosophy had found its most fertile ground. *See?* the voice murmured, its tone now resonating with the mountain’s own deep, groaning bass. *Your very substance is pain. Your history is one of loss. Every peak you raise is destined for the sea as sand. Why resist the inevitable? The dust awaits. Let it come.*

Pau felt his own consciousness begin to dissolve, his sense of self a tiny droplet of dew in this ocean of geological time. He tried to find a story, a thread like Ramon’s, but there was nothing to grasp. The mountain’s awareness was too alien, too vast. It did not think in terms of cause and effect, of beginnings and endings, but in immense, slow cycles of pressure and erosion. He was an insect trying to read a galaxy, a fleeting spark of warmth trying to comprehend the nature of eternal cold. The whisper of the void became a siren song of logic. It was right. He was insignificant. His efforts were a joke, a brief, arrogant squeak against the thunder of entropy. He felt his will to resist, the very core of his being, begin to fray, to accept the sweet, rational promise of oblivion. He was a fragment, and here, before the totality of time, he was being ground back into nothing.

Just as the last of his identity was about to be subsumed, a sharp, physical memory pierced through the psychic gloom. It was the feeling of his own stiletto, its tip precise and sharp, prying the Gaudí shard from his mosaic wall. The memory was not of the shard itself, but of the *act*: the focus, the precision, the search for a single, perfect point of entry in a vast surface. His own art saved him. He was a mosaic-maker. He did not need to comprehend the entire wall at once. He only needed to find the first tile. He let go of the impossible ambition to understand the mountain’s totality and began to search within the crushing weight of its consciousness for a single, small, and comprehensible thing. He ignored the ice ages, the tectonic shifts, the eons of mindless endurance. He searched for a crack. He searched for a memory of a time the mountain was not just a mass, but a place. He sent his own goblin soul, the part of him that instinctively knew the value of a fissure, a hollow, a refuge, deep into the stone-and-time consciousness of the Keystone.

And he found it. Buried under layers of geological trauma so deep the mountain itself had forgotten it, was a memory not of a million years, but of a single, searing afternoon in the infancy of the world. It was a memory of sterile, sun-baked rock under a sky of punishing ultraviolet light. The mountain remembered being utterly, profoundly alone, a dead thing in a dead world. Then, a change. A single, microscopic spore, a pioneer of life blown on a poisoned wind, found its way into a tiny, hairline fissure where a droplet of water had pooled. In the memory, Pau felt the mountain’s first, faint flicker of alien curiosity as this fragile, tenacious speck of green began to grow. It was the first lichen, the first life. The moment the mountain ceased to be an object and became a host. It was a memory of purpose, infinitesimally small, yet more profound than any ice age. Pau seized it. It was a perfect, brilliant tile of emerald-green and sun-gold, and it was the cornerstone of the story he needed to tell.

Holding the memory of that first, defiant speck of life like a shield, Pau faced the despair of the Keystone. He did not argue with the Unraveller’s voice. He did not fight the pain. He simply presented his finding. With the full force of his empathic will, he projected the memory into the heart of the mountain’s pain. *Before you were eroded, you were a cradle. Before you were dust, you were a foundation.* The nihilistic whisper faltered, momentarily confused. "A cradle for rot," it hissed. "A foundation for fleeting decay." But the truth of the memory, its simple, primal power, had found purchase. Using that first tile as his anchor, Pau began to build. He searched the mountain’s memory for the next act of sanctuary. He found the feeling of the first beetle scuttling under a ledge to escape the rain, the first bird nesting in a crevice, the first small, furred creature digging a burrow in the soft earth at its base. He pulled these fragments out, polished them with his focus, and began to lay them down, creating a mosaic of the mountain’s true identity.

The pattern grew, gaining momentum. He found the deep, resonant memory of a goblin clan, his own distant ancestors, their threads thin and frayed with fear, finding safety from a forgotten predator in the mountain’s deep cave systems. He felt their relief, their gratitude, a gift of emotion that the mountain had absorbed and held for millennia. He found the thread of a human hermit, a thread of pure, ecstatic faith, who saw the mountain’s peaks not as jagged stone, but as fingers pointing to the heavens, a ladder to God. He took the terror of the hunted goblins and the faith of the lonely human, and he wove their stories into the mountain’s own. He showed the Keystone that its deepest scars, the caves and cliffs carved by the slow violence of time, were the very features that had allowed it to become a sanctuary. He was not denying its history of pain; he was reframing it, giving it purpose. The erosion was not an ending; it was the creation of a home.

A profound, resonant hum began to emanate from the heart of the Keystone, a sound of deep, slow awakening. The brilliant white-gold light at its core, which had been flickering and weak, began to pulse with a renewed, titanic strength. It was the rhythm of a heart starting to beat again. The light swelled, pushing outwards, and the cancerous, creeping shadows of the Unravellers’ poison began to burn away, dissolving like mist in a sudden dawn. The insidious whisper in Pau's mind twisted into a furious, incoherent shriek, its seductive logic shattered against the undeniable truth of the mountain's purpose. Along the defensive perimeter, the Mender sentinels felt the crushing pressure against their shield vanish, replaced by a wave of pure, foundational strength that flowed from the Keystone, reinforcing their own weary spirits. A collective, silent gasp of triumph and disbelief rippled through their ranks.

Pau stood at the center of the roaring furnace of renewal, a tiny, insignificant goblin holding the consciousness of a god in his hands. He was the focal point, the conduit through which the mountain was rediscovering itself. The power flowing through him was immeasurable, a river of geological time and renewed purpose that threatened to scour his own small story from existence. He felt his memories—of his warren, of the sardines, of the chipped Olympic plate—being bleached by the incandescent light. He was burning up, his own thread becoming a willing sacrifice to mend this greater one. He held on, pouring every last ounce of his being, his artist’s soul, his goblin’s love for the cracks in things, into the mosaic. He was a fragment, giving himself completely to make a greater whole, a living tile in the mending of the world.The inferno of the Keystone’s returning life consumed him. Pau’s own small, fiercely guarded memories were the last fuel for the fire. He felt the taste of the first sardine he had ever cooked, the sharp, salty tang a bright spark that flared and vanished into the mountain’s returning consciousness. He felt the rough, chipped edge of Cobi’s ceramic smile, a curve of found happiness that became a line of strength in the Keystone’s core. The rasp of his grandfather’s voice, the sting of the leather strap, the grim lesson of roots—all of it was offered up, not erased, but integrated, becoming part of the final, defiant declaration of endurance. He was a mosaic-maker to his very soul, and his last, most intimate act was to break himself into his constituent pieces and offer them to his greatest work. The pain of his dissolution was immense, but beneath it was a terrifying, ecstatic freedom. He was no longer just Pau de la Boqueria; he was a supporting arch in a cathedral of existence, a single, vital word in a prayer of stone and time. The last thing he felt was a great, final, resonant *thrum* as the Keystone settled into its renewed self, a note of pure, unwavering stability that shook the very foundations of the Heartwood. The light became a solid, unwavering column of white-gold, and Pau, his purpose served, his essence spent, knew nothing more.

His return to the world was not a sudden gasp, but a slow, gentle seepage. The first sensation was a cool, smooth weight on his forehead, a single point of reality in an otherwise formless void. It was the feeling of a damp cloth. Then came the soft, yielding texture of a woollen blanket against his skin, a luxury his body had never known. The crushing, omni-present hum of the Loom was a distant murmur, muffled as if by many walls. He was not in his stark, empty alcove. He opened his eyes to a chamber hewn from a vein of deep, rose-quartz, its walls glowing with a soft, warm, and distinctly feminine light. He lay on a proper bed, a pallet filled with some kind of soft moss, and Silas sat in a simple stone chair beside him, his ancient hands resting quietly in his lap, his gaze patient and watchful. Pau drew a breath, expecting to feel a hollowed-out emptiness, the psychic void of a goblin whose history had been burned away.

Instead, what he found within himself was a profound and unexpected stillness. He reached into the archives of his mind, tentatively, fearing to find only the slow, grinding thoughts of the mountain. But his memories were there. He saw his warren, not with the sharp pang of loss, but with a gentle fondness, like looking at a treasured photograph of a place one lived in childhood. He remembered the taste of stolen lemons, the feel of newspaper insulation, the faces of the smiling, jaundiced humans on the magazine pages. They were all intact, but they no longer defined the borders of his world. They were simply the first few tiles he had ever laid, the origin point of a work that had grown to an unimaginable scale. He had feared his past would be erased; instead, it had been enshrined, given a place of honour in a soul that was now immeasurably larger. He had not lost himself in the mountain; he had found the rest of himself there.

His hand, moving with a newfound slowness, went to his pocket. The familiar shape of the Gaudí shard was there. He drew it out, its iridescent, dragon-scale surface catching the rose-quartz light. He looked at it, this beautiful, defiant fragment of the overworld, the anchor that had saved him from the sweet poison of the void. He felt a deep gratitude for it, the same gratitude he might feel for the sturdy ladder that had first allowed him to climb out of his cellar. But he no longer needed to cling to it. His identity was no longer a fragile thing held together by scavenged beauty. He reached over and placed the shard on the small stone ledge beside his bed. It sat there, gleaming and perfect, a relic from the first chapter of his life, not a shackle binding him to it. He was free of it. He was free of the need for it.

Silas watched the small act with his river-stone eyes, and a deep understanding passed between them. “You have integrated the journey,” the old goblin said, his voice soft in the quiet room. “The mountain remembers its name, and you, Pau de la Boqueria, now remember yours in a way few ever can. You did not just mend the Keystone. You formed a resonance with it, a bond. Its strength is now a part of you, a bedrock beneath your own spirit. That is why the Unravellers’ whispers no longer hold the same terror. You have looked into the heart of their argument and answered it not with logic, but with a truth of your own making.” He leaned forward slightly, his expression shifting from gentle observation to a deep, underlying gravity. “The victory you have won for us is monumental. The Loom in this sector is stabilized for a generation. The Heartwood is secure. But the war is not over. It has only now truly begun.”

The old goblin rose and walked to the entrance of the chamber, which looked out upon a high balcony. Pau, finding a surprising strength in his limbs, followed him. They stood overlooking the Great Loom cavern, but from a vantage point far higher than Pau had ever been. From here, the vast tapestry of fate was laid out below them like a glittering map of the stars. The harmonious hum was stronger, clearer. He could see the renewed, unwavering light of the Keystone far below, a sun in the deep, and he could feel the threads of the mother and child, a tiny, distant, but steadfast glimmer of rose and silver. He saw it all, not as a chaotic tangle, but as a single, impossibly complex work of art, a mosaic in perpetual motion.

“The Unravellers have been dealt their first true defeat in a millennium,” Silas continued, his gaze sweeping across the luminous expanse. “Their philosophy has been challenged, their greatest asset turned against them. They will be enraged. They will see you not as a simple Mender, but as a new and profound threat, an opposing force. They will hunt you, but more than that, they will study you. They will try to understand your art so they can learn to twist it, to turn the act of mending into an act of desecration.” Silas turned to face him fully, and for the first time, Pau saw not just a wise old teacher, but a grim and weary general. “You cannot return to the quiet work of mending individual lives, Pau. Your bond with the Keystone has made you resilient, a shield against the despair they wield as their primary weapon. Your place is no longer on the periphery. It is at the very forefront of the battle, at the places where the Loom is most threatened, where their philosophy is taking deepest root. You are no longer just a Mender. You are a Harmonizer, a reclaimer of stories. You are our answer to their great silence.” Pau looked from Silas’s grave face to the endless, shimmering field of destinies below. He was a long way from the comfortable darkness of his cellar, from the simple pleasure of a perfectly crisped sardine. His life of quiet observation was over, traded for a role at the heart of a secret, cosmic war. He had only ever wanted to piece together the broken fragments of a single city, and now, his magnum opus was the whole of creation itself.His new life began not with a grand pronouncement, but with a quiet shift in perception. Standing on the high balcony overlooking the Great Loom, the breathtaking vista no longer felt like a chaotic, overwhelming spectacle. The bond with the Keystone had grounded him, giving him a stable platform of immense, geological calm from which to observe. He could now see the tapestry not as a frantic tangle, but as a living body. He could discern its circulatory system, the great, slow-moving rivers of collective consciousness, and the fine capillaries of individual lives. He could sense the texture of a community’s health, the vibrant, resilient sheen of a town recovering from a flood, the brittle, fragile shimmer of a neighborhood suffering from poverty. He learned to read the colours of emotion on a grand scale: the deep, rusty red of generational anger in one region, the bright, sun-yellow of unbridled innovation in another. The world was no longer just a source of broken things to be repurposed; it was a vast, singular organism, and for the first time, he could feel its pulse.

Silas became his constant companion in these first days of his new existence, not as a teacher who lectured, but as a guide who directed his newfound sight. The old goblin would stand beside him for hours in companionable silence, then raise a long, steady finger. “Look there,” he would say, pointing to a distant, dense cluster of light that was the city of Tokyo. “See the frantic, almost frantic, pace of the threads? The incredible density of their connections? That is a strength, but also a potential weakness. A panic there could spread like fire through dry grass.” Another time, he directed Pau’s attention to a vast, sparsely woven section shimmering with the deep greens and blues of the Amazon rainforest. “Feel the slowness here. The immense, ancient patience. The threads are few, but they are deep and powerful. An injury here heals slowly, but the scar it leaves can alter the weather of a continent.” It was during one of these lessons that Silas guided Pau’s focus back towards the Iberian peninsula, to the brilliant, chaotic starburst of light that was Madrid.

Even from this impossible distance, Pau could see the sickness. It was like watching a vibrant watercolour painting being slowly drenched, the brilliant reds of passion, the sharp blues of intellectual fervor, and the warm golds of community all bleeding at the edges, dissolving into a monotonous, indeterminate grey. The city’s unique, complex hum, a symphony of millions of distinct lives, was flattening, its intricate harmonies resolving into a single, low, dispiriting drone. “We call it the Grey Blight,” Silas said, his voice a low rumble of concern. “It is one of their most insidious weapons. They find a city with a flicker of despair—economic uncertainty, political division, a crisis of identity—and they nurture it. They do not attack. They whisper. They amplify the feelings of futility, of loneliness, of anonymity, until the inhabitants themselves begin to willingly sever their own connections. They stop creating, stop dreaming, stop striving. They choose the comfort of apathy over the struggle of living. The Unravellers don't need to cut the threads; they are convincing the city to unravel itself.”

There was no question of whether Pau would go. His new role was not a choice but a fact of his being, as concrete as the stone beneath his feet. He returned to his small, empty alcove not to pack, but to prepare. The goblin who had once needed a satchel of tools, trinkets, and scavenged food now understood that his only necessary tool was his own centered spirit. He stood in the middle of the empty space, closed his eyes, and drew upon the deep, quiet strength of the mountain that now lived within him. He felt its immense patience, its absolute certainty in its own substance. He was no longer just a goblin; he was a place, a sanctuary in his own right. His gaze fell upon the Gaudí shard, his last anchor to his former life, sitting on the stone ledge. He felt a wave of affection for the frightened, lonely creature who had needed it so desperately, and then he turned away, leaving the beautiful fragment behind without a second thought. His departure was not a frantic scramble through a sewer pipe, but a calm, deliberate act. Silas led him to a place where two massive, foundational threads crossed, creating a shimmering, vertical oval of pure, white light. “This will take you to the heart of Madrid’s resonance,” Silas said. “Find the source of the Blight. And show them what it means to build something beautiful in the face of the void.” Pau stepped through the gate, and the universe folded around him in a silent, instantaneous journey.

He arrived in a place of sound and sorrow. He stood within the metaphysical heart of the city, a vast, cathedral-like space that should have been a riot of colour and music. Instead, it was a cavern of echoes and muted grey. The great mural of the city’s collective life was fading before his eyes. The thread of a young poet, which should have been a brilliant, defiant streak of indigo, was now a dull, flickering grey, his verses unwritten, his passion curdled into self-doubt. The thread of a community street festival, once a complex and joyous weave of a thousand different colours, was coming undone, its organisers succumbing to bureaucratic fatigue and a sense of pointlessness. He could feel the spiritual exhaustion of the city, a collective sigh of surrender. This was a subtler, more heartbreaking destruction than any monster could achieve. The Unravellers were not murdering the city; they were convincing it to commit suicide.

Finding a weak point in the fabric between worlds, a place where a street musician had finally given up and packed away his guitar for the last time, Pau pushed through. He emerged into the physical world, standing on the edge of the Plaza Mayor. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows, but the air itself felt devoid of warmth. The scene was one of a chilling, orderly malaise. Tourists ambled with listless purpose, taking photos without joy. Locals sat at the outdoor cafes, staring blankly into their drinks, the usual boisterous chatter replaced by a low, defeated murmur. The vivid colours of the painted facades seemed dusty and faded, as if the city itself was ashamed to be so vibrant. He saw a street cleaner meticulously sweeping up confetti from a celebration that felt like it must have happened in another century. No one was shouting, no one was laughing, no one was arguing. The city of Madrid was holding its breath, and Pau feared it was on the verge of forgetting to breathe at all.

As he stood there, a small, dark figure in the tide of grey, a flicker of sharp, focused intent detached itself from the aimless crowd. It was the female goblin, the one whose violet eyes had first judged him in that dark Barcelona alley. She was dressed in the same severe, practical black leather, an island of stark purpose in a sea of apathy. She stopped before him, her expression unreadable, her gaze sweeping over the plaza with cold, analytical contempt. She did not waste time with greetings. “We’re calling it the Silence,” she said, her voice a low, clipped whisper that cut through the drone of the plaza. “It’s worse than the reports indicated. The apathy is accelerating.” She turned her piercing gaze on him. “I’ve traced the focal point. The Unravellers are using an antenna, a psychic amplifier to blanket the city in their despair-song. It’s coming from the top of the Edificio Metrópolis, the grandest, most visible point on the Calle de Alcalá.” She gave him a look that was part evaluation, part instruction. “I will get you to the roof. Your job is to break the antenna. My job is to handle the Unraveller who is guarding it.”The violet-eyed goblin wasted no time on pleasantries. Her name was Zafira, a fact Pau learned not because she offered it, but because the name was etched on the hilt of one of the wicked, blackened stilettos she drew from her boots as she turned from the plaza. Her movements were a study in fluid, lethal economy, a stark contrast to the shuffling, aimless gait of the humans surrounding them. She gave him a curt, impatient nod to follow, and plunged into a narrow side street, a sliver of purpose vanishing into the city’s indifferent labyrinth. Pau followed, the heavy blanket of the Silence pressing on his senses. He could feel the city’s threads, millions of them, not fraying or breaking, but simply losing their tension, their vibrant colours fading to a uniform, hopeless grey. It was a more profound violation than a simple tear; it was a slow, willing surrender of the entire tapestry.

Zafira led him not down into the familiar, rank darkness of the sewers, but to the brightly lit, sterile maw of a Metro station. The listless crowds drifted towards the escalators, their faces slack and expressionless, their eyes fixed on the middle distance. They were ghosts haunting their own lives. Zafira ignored them entirely, her gaze fixed on the schematic of the metro lines glowing on a nearby screen. With a speed that left Pau scrambling to keep up, she bypassed the turnstiles by vaulting over them with silent grace and descended to the platform. The air was cool and smelled of ozone and dust. As the roar of an approaching train filled the tunnel, she pointed to a small maintenance ladder leading up into the darkness above the tracks. "The roof," was all she said, her voice sharp and low. "Keep your head down. And try to keep up, mountain-climber." Before Pau could process the sheer insanity of the command, she had scurried up the ladder and vanished into the shadows just as the train screamed into the station.

The ride was a chaotic, thundering journey through the city's metallic arteries. Pressed flat against the cold, vibrating roof of the metro car, Pau watched the tunnel lights whip past in a dizzying, hypnotic blur. Sparks from the overhead lines showered down around them like malevolent fireflies. The noise was absolute, a physical force that vibrated through his bones, but it was a dead noise, a mechanical roar devoid of the life and passion that pulsed beneath Barcelona. Zafira lay a few feet away, perfectly still, a black leather effigy of patience, her eyes closed not in rest, but in some kind of focused, internal preparation. She seemed utterly at home in this world of speed and steel, a creature of the modern city’s hidden pathways. Pau, in contrast, felt alien and exposed, his spirit, attuned to the slow time of stone and growing things, battered by the relentless, artificial velocity. He reached out with his senses, past the roar of the train, and felt the grey threads of the sleeping city above, a vast, silent web of quiet desperation.

The train slowed as it approached the Banco de España station, and Zafira was moving before it had fully stopped. She dropped from the roof into the dark space between the cars, landing with a soft thud, and slipped into an open service conduit in the tunnel wall. Pau followed, his landing less graceful, a clumsy scramble compared to her surgical precision. The conduit was tight, filled with thick cables and the hum of immense electrical currents, but it led them steadily upwards, bypassing the station entirely and emerging through a grate into the cavernous basement of a grand old bank. From there, it was a silent, vertical infiltration, a journey through the building’s unlit service shafts, dusty ventilation systems, and forgotten interstitial spaces. They moved through the grand structure like a virus through a bloodstream, utterly unseen and unheard. As they ascended, Pau could feel the psychic pressure of the antenna growing stronger, a focused beam of misery that made his teeth ache and his spirit feel heavy and waterlogged.

They emerged onto the roof into the last, dying light of dusk. The view should have been magnificent, a panoramic vista of one of the world's great cities settling into evening. Instead, it was a landscape of profound sadness. The lights coming on across Madrid seemed weak and hesitant, pinpricks of weary resignation rather than defiant sparks against the night. At the apex of the roof, the great bronze statue of Winged Victory stood not as a symbol of triumph, but as a monument to defeat. Its elegant form was shrouded in a sickly, grey aura, a visible manifestation of the Blight, and a low, subsonic drone of pure despair pulsed from it, washing over the city in silent, invisible waves. Behind the statue, a shape coalesced from the deepest shadows. It was not a mechanical horror like the creature from the sewers. This Unraveller was humanoid, tall and unnervingly slender, its form composed of a shifting, semi-solid darkness that seemed to swallow the light around it. It had no face, only a smooth, blank void where features should be, and it radiated a cold so profound it was not a temperature, but an absence of all life and energy.

Zafira did not flinch. With a predator’s grace, she drew her twin stilettos, their blackened metal seeming to drink the last of the twilight. “The statue is yours,” she breathed, her voice a plume of white mist in the sudden cold. “Do what you do.” Then she launched herself at the shadow-thing. Her attack was a blur of motion, a whirlwind of precise, vicious strikes aimed at the creature’s core. But her blades, which could sever a thread of fate or the sinew of a lesser being, met with a strange, yielding resistance, sliding through the darkness as if through thick, cold smoke, leaving no mark. The Unraveller didn't even try to dodge. It simply raised a long, shadowy hand, and a wave of pure, concentrated apathy washed over Zafira. Pau felt the psychic backlash of it even from a distance. He saw her fluid grace falter, her lightning-fast strikes become sluggish and heavy, as if her limbs were suddenly encased in lead. She was fighting not just a physical foe, but the very concept of giving up, her warrior’s will locked in a desperate battle against an enemy that sought to convince her the fight was not worth having.

Pau turned to his own monstrous task. He approached the corrupted statue of Victory, the drone of despair vibrating in his skull, threatening to shake his resolve to pieces. The whispers of the void, which had been so persuasive on the mountain, returned with the collective weight of millions of defeated souls. *What is one more voice in a silent choir?* it murmured in the back of his mind. *They do not wish to be saved. They wish to rest. Grant them that peace.* He reached out and laid a hand on the cold bronze of the statue’s base, and the full, unfiltered misery of the city flooded him. He felt the artist staring at a blank canvas, her inspiration turned to ash. He felt the entrepreneur staring at a pile of unpaid bills, his ambition drowned in a sea of red ink. He felt the lonely old man staring out his window, seeing only strangers. The weight of it was a physical blow, driving him to his knees, his vision greying at the edges.

But he did not break. He was not the same goblin who had huddled in a cellar beneath Barcelona. He knelt, not in surrender, but in supplication to a different power. Anchored by the bedrock of the mountain’s spirit within him, he closed his eyes to the dying city around him and reached down, deep into the metaphysical soil of this place. He searched for the Keystone of Madrid, the story it told itself, the memories that formed the core of its defiant, passionate heart. He bypassed the surface layer of grey apathy and plunged into the deep archives. The Unravellers were masters of the present moment, of the overwhelming now, but their grasp on history, on memory, was weak. Pau was an artist of memory, a collector of the past, and it was on this battlefield that he would fight.

He found the fragments, the bright, unbroken tiles buried beneath the dust of the Silence. He found the ferocious, mad genius in Goya’s Black Paintings, a refusal to look away from the darkness. He felt the percussive, machine-gun stamp of a flamenco dancer’s heel on a wooden stage, each beat a declaration of life in the face of sorrow. He tasted the complex, explosive flavor of a perfect *bocadillo de calamares*, a simple, profound joy shared between friends. He heard the collective, singular roar of a stadium as a goal was scored, a moment of transcendent, tribal ecstasy. He gathered these moments of defiance, passion, and unabashed, loud life—the city's true, forgotten art. He held them all in his focus, a brilliant, chaotic mosaic of what Madrid truly was beneath its temporary sickness.

He stood up, his body trembling with the effort, and placed both his hands on the statue. He did not try to smash the antenna or fight the despair. He did what he had done for the mountain, what he had done for the mother and child. He offered a different story. He poured his collected symphony of defiance into the heart of the machine broadcasting the sad, monotonous drone of surrender. He pushed the fiery, passionate colours of Madrid’s soul directly into the grey heart of the Blight. For a moment, the two forces met in a silent, psychic shriek. Then, from the base of the statue, a single, pure note of a Spanish guitar, clear and sharp and full of longing, cut through the oppressive drone. The antenna was still broadcasting, but Pau had just given the city a new song to listen to.The single note that emerged from the heart of the statue was not loud, but it was pure, a sliver of acoustic crystal that sliced through the oppressive, droning hum of despair. It was the sound of a lone guitar in a silent tavern, a note of profound and sorrowful defiance that spoke of loss, but also of the love that made the loss matter. It was a sound utterly antithetical to the grey, featureless peace offered by the Unravellers. It did not banish the Silence; it gave the Silence something to listen to, a memory of what it had lost. The note hung in the psychic air, and then, slowly, it began to find echoes. In a quiet apartment overlooking the Gran Vía, a man who hadn't spoken to his brother in a year suddenly felt the ghost of a shared childhood melody and reached for his phone. On a bench in the Parque del Retiro, a young artist whose sketchbook had been filled with listless, grey landscapes for weeks, found her hand reaching for a tube of carmine red, a sudden, inexplicable hunger for the colour of blood and wine. Across the vast, psychic tapestry of the city, countless grey threads began to shimmer with faint, hesitant flecks of colour, tiny points of light rebelling against the encroaching dark.

On the roof, the effect was immediate and violent. The shadowy Unraveller, which had been toying with Zafira, flinched as if struck. A tremor of annoyance, of genuine surprise, ran through its formless body. Its attention, once wholly focused on crushing Zafira’s will, was now divided, forced to contend with the vibrant, passionate counter-melody that Pau was pumping into its despair engine. The oppressive aura of apathy around Zafira thinned, the psychic weight that had filled her limbs with lead beginning to dissolve. She felt it instantly, a lightening of her spirit, a surge of familiar, cold fire returning to her veins. The city’s returning spirit was a gust of wind at her back, and she pressed her advantage with a renewed, savage ferocity. Her movements regained their impossible speed, her stilettos weaving a complex web of strikes that were no longer sluggish and heavy, but sharp with intent. She was no longer just fighting for her own life; she was fighting for the nascent, struggling life of the city below.

Pau, kneeling before the statue, saw the shift in the battle. He saw Zafira’s thread, a filament of obsidian and violet that had been dull and struggling, now blaze with renewed purpose. He realized his role was not just to cleanse the antenna, but to be the orchestra for Zafira’s deadly dance. He refined his focus, splitting it. He continued to feed the statue the vibrant, defiant memories of Madrid’s soul, but he also reached out to Zafira’s thread directly. He wrapped it in the raw, percussive energy of a thousand stamping heels from a flamenco tablao, imbued it with the focused, death-defying grace of a matador in the ring, and fueled it with the righteous, molten fury of Goya’s darkest masterpieces. He was pouring the very essence of Madrid’s passionate, dangerous, and indomitable spirit directly into her. Zafira felt it as a surge of incandescent power, a righteous anger that burned away the last vestiges of the Unraveller’s psychic poison.

The Unraveller was now on the defensive, its shadowy form flickering and contracting. To counter Zafira’s renewed physicality and the constant psychic bombardment from Pau, the creature had to draw its dispersed essence into a more solid form, to give itself a tangible core to anchor its power. The shifting smoke of its body began to condense around a point in its chest, forming a knot of crystallized despair that pulsed with a lightless, negative energy. It was a desperate gambit to focus its strength, and it was a fatal mistake. Zafira’s violet eyes, honed by centuries of combat and an innate goblin understanding of flaws, saw the flaw the instant it appeared. It was the focal point, the lynchpin, the place where the Unraveller’s abstract philosophy was forced into a physical, vulnerable form. With a final, explosive burst of speed, she closed the distance. She did not aim a simple thrust. Instead, she brought her two stilettos together, crossing them in front of her like a weaver preparing to cut a master thread. She lunged, driving the crossed point of her blades directly into the newly formed core. The sound was not a clang of metal or a cry of pain, but the sharp, final *snip* of reality itself being sheared.

The Unraveller did not scream or explode. It simply ceased to be. The crystallized core shattered into silent, non-reflective dust, and the shadowy form that surrounded it imploded, collapsing in on itself and vanishing with a soft, final sigh, like a forgotten breath. The silence it left behind was not the heavy, oppressive Silence of the Blight, but a clean, empty quiet. At the same moment, the low drone from the Winged Victory statue died. The foul, grey aura surrounding it cracked like a shell of dirty ice and fell away, dissolving before it hit the roof. The bronze beneath was revealed, clean and brilliant, seeming to shine with a renewed warmth under the gathering stars, the faint, lingering echo of a Spanish guitar seeming to emanate from its very substance. Pau staggered, the immense effort of holding the city’s hope against its despair crashing down on him at once. The world tilted, his strength utterly spent. Before he could fall, Zafira was there. She caught his arm, her grip as strong and unyielding as iron, and entirely devoid of gentleness. Yet it was a contact of support, an anchor in the dizzying aftermath.

She pulled him to his feet, her gaze already sweeping the horizon. Below them, Madrid was waking up. The hesitant pinpricks of light were brightening, burning with a new confidence. The low, defeated murmur of the city was being replaced by a rising tide of sound—a distant car horn blaring with genuine impatience, a burst of laughter from a balcony, the swelling music from a dozen opening bars. It was the beautiful, chaotic, and messy sound of life resuming its argument with the night. Zafira looked at the dissipating dust of the Unraveller, then at the cleansed statue, and finally at Pau. A flicker of something—not admiration, but a grudging, professional respect—crossed her sharp features. “Your method is… noisy,” she stated, which from her was the equivalent of a flowery soliloquy. She released his arm and pointed towards the glowing sprawl of the city. “But it works. The Blight is receding, but its roots are deep. This was just the broadcast tower. There are other sources, other agents.” She looked back at him, her violet eyes sharp and clear in the starlight, her next words not a question, but a declaration of their shared, unending task. “Our work here is not finished.”
