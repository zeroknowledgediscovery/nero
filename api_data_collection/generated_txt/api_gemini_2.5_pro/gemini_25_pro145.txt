The wind off Corio Bay had a particular spite to it in winter. It wasn't just cold; it was a physical presence, a bully that shoved you from behind and picked at the seams of your coat with icy fingers. Stafford felt it pushing against the ladder, a low, insistent moan through the aluminium rungs. He held the pliers tight in his gloved hand, his knuckles white. Just a wire. Red to red, black to black. The simple, immutable logic of it was a comfort against the chaotic sky, a swirl of bruised purple and grey. He wasn't paid to think about the sky. He was paid to connect things, to make the current flow, to bring light to dark places. A job in North Geelong, restoring power to a weatherboard cottage that had seen better decades. The owner, a woman with a face like a roadmap of worry, had given him a cup of tea so weak it was barely coloured water. He'd drunk it gratefully.

He finished the connection, cinched the final zip tie, and closed the junction box. The click was satisfyingly final. Light. Down below, a single window in the cottage flickered and then glowed with a steady, warm yellow. A small victory. He gathered his tools, the metal clinking a familiar, tuneless song. It was Tuesday. The thought of it was a separate warmth, a different kind of current that started low in his gut. Tuesday meant the TAFE, the drafty lecture hall, the squeak of plastic chairs on linoleum. It meant Mr. Aris Thorne.

Driving back across the Moorabool Street bridge, the city lights smeared across his windscreen by a fresh spatter of rain. Geelong wasn't a pretty city, not in the way people meant when they said 'pretty'. It was functional, sinewy. All brick and concrete and low-slung industrial sheds hugging the waterfront. But Stafford had found a kind of beauty in it lately. He’d started noticing the way the setting sun caught the top of the stadium, turning the entire structure into a blazing crown, or the stoic grace of the old woolstores, even with their windows boarded up. It was as if his eyes had been rewired. Everything looked different, sharper, imbued with a significance it hadn’t had before. He knew precisely when the change had happened. It was eight weeks ago, the first night of ‘The Architecture of Narrative’.

He’d signed up for the course on a whim. A flyer, tacked to the smoko-room noticeboard, curled and coffee-stained. ‘Expand Your Mind,’ it had declared in a bold, optimistic font. Most of the blokes had laughed. ‘Don’t need my mind expanded, mate, need my wallet expanded.’ But Stafford, feeling the four walls of his unit closing in on him night after night, had torn off the little tab at the bottom. The class was held in a beige box of a room that always smelled faintly of floor polish and despair. And into this box, every Tuesday at seven, walked Aris Thorne.

He wasn't what Stafford had expected. He wasn't a stuffy academic. He was tall and impossibly thin, as if he’d been stretched, with a cascade of dark hair that was always falling into his eyes. He wore worn-out tweed jackets over thin jumpers, and his shoes, scuffed brown leather, looked like they'd walked through a dozen other lives before this one. But it was his voice. His voice could take the four beige walls and dissolve them. It was a low, melodic thing, a storyteller's voice that could make the Epic of Gilgamesh sound like a secret he was telling only to you.

Stafford parked his ute and sat for a moment in the humming silence. The rain was heavier now, drumming on the roof. He was early, always early. He liked to sit in the lecture hall before it filled up, to watch the others drift in: the retired librarian with her neat thermos, the young art student with paint under her fingernails, the bored-looking husband dragged along by his eager wife. They were a strange constellation of people, drawn together by some shared, unspoken need for… something more. Then Aris would arrive, always five minutes late, always looking like he’d been wrestling with a minor demon on the way over. He’d drop a battered leather satchel onto the lectern, push the hair from his eyes with a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of the whole world, and he would begin.

Tonight, he walked in and the sigh was deeper than usual. A faint tremor ran through it. He looked paler, the skin under his eyes a delicate, shadowy blue. He smiled at the class, a fleeting, tired gesture. "Evening, all. Apologies for the delay. The elements are against us tonight, it seems." His voice was rougher than usual, a layer of gravel under the velvet. He cleared his throat, a dry, rasping sound.

"Tonight," he said, his eyes sweeping the room, "we speak of the inciting incident. The call to adventure. The moment the world tilts on its axis and the hero’s ordinary life is changed, irrevocably." As he spoke, he paced. A restless, caged energy about him tonight. He wasn't just lecturing; he was testifying. He spoke of Odysseus, languishing on Ogygia, his life in stasis until the gods decided it was time for him to go home. He spoke of Frodo Baggins, comfortable in his hobbit-hole until a wizard knocked on his door.

"It is not always a wizard," Aris said, his gaze momentarily locking with Stafford’s. Or so it felt. The room was full, but in that instant, the connection was as direct as a live wire. "Sometimes, the call is a whisper. A sudden illness. A chance meeting. A book falling from a shelf. A realisation that the life you are living is no longer enough. The world you thought you knew reveals itself to be a thin veneer over something much older, much stranger, much more terrifying… and much more beautiful."

A shiver went through Stafford, a jolt that had nothing to do with the draft from the window. That was it. That was him. He was on Ogygia. This room, this man, this was the knock on the door. Aris turned to the whiteboard, his hand unsteady as he uncapped a marker. He began to draw a diagram, a simple rising line, but his hand shook so much the line became a jagged, frantic scribble. He stopped, pressing his palm flat against the cool white surface as if to steady himself. A cough rattled his thin frame, a dry, hacking sound that seemed to tear at him from the inside.

The class shifted, a collective murmur of concern. The retired librarian half-rose from her seat.

Aris held up a hand, his back still to them. "Fine," he rasped, the word broken in two. "Just a… a tickle." He took a deep, shuddering breath and turned back, forcing another weak smile. "Where were we? Ah, yes. The threshold." He looked exhausted. Utterly, profoundly spent. The passion that usually burned in his eyes was banked, leaving only a faint, feverish glimmer. And in that moment, seeing the tremor in his hands and the fragile transparency of his skin under the harsh fluorescent lights, Stafford felt something shift inside him. It wasn't just admiration anymore. It was a fierce, protective ache, a sudden, overwhelming urge to cross the room, to steady him, to wrap him in a blanket and chase the chill from his bones. It was the most dangerous feeling in the world. He knew, with the certainty of a flipped switch, that the circuit was now closed. His ordinary life was over. He had answered the call.The cough came again, deeper this time, a raw, scraping sound that echoed in the quiet room. Aris leaned heavily on the lectern, his shoulders hunched. He reached for a bottle of water from his satchel, his fingers fumbling with the cap. The plastic crinkled loudly in the silence. He took a long swallow, his throat working. When he looked up again, the attempt at a smile didn't reach his eyes. The feverish light in them had intensified, as if the effort of standing was burning through his last reserves of fuel. He seemed smaller, somehow, stripped of his lecturer’s authority, leaving only a man struggling against his own body.

"The threshold..." he began again, his voice a hoarse whisper. "The threshold is where the hero must confront the guardian. The force that says, 'Turn back. Stay in the ordinary world where it is safe'." He gestured vaguely towards the scribble on the board. "It is a test of... of resolve." He faltered, his gaze losing focus as he stared at the back wall. The room held its breath. The young art student had stopped doodling, her pen poised over the page. Even the bored husband was sitting straighter, a flicker of concern on his face. The collective energy of the room had shifted from academic curiosity to a shared, fragile anxiety.

With a final, defeated exhalation of breath, Aris surrendered. "I... I do apologise," he said, the words barely audible. "I don't think I can continue tonight. Class dismissed." There was a moment of stunned stillness, then the spell broke. The sounds of the ordinary world rushed back in: the zipping of pencil cases, the rustle of notebooks being closed, the scrape of chairs as people stood up. A few people murmured 'get well soon' as they filed past the front, but they kept their distance, as if his illness were a private, slightly embarrassing affair. Stafford didn't move. He sat there, a solid, unmoving shape in the sea of quiet departure, his tool bag a heavy weight at his feet. He watched as the room emptied, leaving just the two of them in the humming fluorescent glare.

Aris sagged against the lectern as the door clicked shut behind the last student. He looked utterly spent, his head bowed, his dark hair falling forward to hide his face. He packed his satchel with slow, clumsy movements, a book slipping from his grasp and landing on the floor with a soft thud. He stared at it for a moment as if the effort of bending down was insurmountable. Stafford stood up. The sound of his work boots on the linoleum was solid, deliberate. He walked to the front of the room, his shadow stretching long before him, and bent down. He picked up the book – a well-worn copy of The Odyssey – and placed it gently on the lectern.

"Rough night," Stafford said. It wasn't a question. His voice was low, steady, a contrast to the ragged edges of Aris's breathing. Aris startled, his head snapping up. His eyes, wide and dark in his pale face, were filled with a surprised vulnerability. He hadn't realised he wasn't alone. "Stafford, isn't it?" he asked, his voice thin. He tried to pull himself upright, to gather the tattered edges of his professional persona around him, but another tremor ran through his hands. "Yes. Thank you. I seem to be all thumbs tonight."

"You look like you're about to fall over," Stafford stated, his gaze direct. There was no judgment in it, just a simple observation of fact, the same way he might state that a wire was frayed or a fuse was blown. "You shouldn't be driving." He watched Aris sway slightly, watched him grip the lectern to steady himself. The urge to act, to fix, was a physical pressure in his chest. This was a different kind of broken circuit, a human one, and every instinct he had was screaming at him to find the fault and make it right.

Aris gave a short, humourless laugh that dissolved into another cough. "A bit dramatic, don't you think? It's just a cold. And my car is just outside." He gestured weakly toward the window, where the rain was now coming down in sheets, plastering wet leaves against the glass. He zipped his satchel and tried to lift it, but the simple weight of it seemed to throw him off balance. Stafford’s hand shot out, not touching Aris, but resting on the leather strap of the bag. "I'll give you a lift," he said. Again, it wasn't a question. It was a statement of what was going to happen. "My ute's right out the front. It's dry."Aris looked from Stafford’s hand on his satchel to his face. For a moment, a flash of the haughty lecturer reappeared, a spark of indignation in his dark eyes. He opened his mouth to protest, to insist on his own competence, but the words caught in his throat. What came out instead was a dry, rasping cough that bent him double. The room tilted slightly, the fluorescent lights swimming into long, wavering lines. He saw Stafford’s hand move, not to him, but to steady the lectern Aris was clinging to. The gesture was impersonal, practical, as if he were shoring up a loose post.

"Look," Stafford said, his voice still quiet, but with an undercurrent of finality that cut through Aris's dizzy haze. "You can argue with me and we can stand here all night while you get worse, or you can let me drive you home. Either way, you're not getting behind the wheel of a car." He wasn't being kind, not exactly. He was being logical. He was presenting an equation with only one reasonable solution. The sheer, unshakeable certainty of it was, in its own way, a comfort. The fight drained out of Aris in a long, shuddering sigh. He felt boneless, held up only by the lectern and Stafford’s immovable will. He gave a small, defeated nod.

"Right then," Stafford said, as if a contract had just been signed. He lifted the heavy leather satchel from the lectern, the weight of it settling easily into his grip. "Keys?" Aris fumbled in his jacket pocket, his numb fingers struggling to isolate the small piece of metal. Stafford waited patiently, his presence a zone of calm in Aris's feverish storm. Finally, Aris produced the key to his small office down the hall. Stafford took it, locked the lecture hall door behind them, and then led the way down the deserted, echoing corridor. The air was cold and smelled of disinfectant. When they pushed through the main doors into the night, the wind hit them like a physical blow, driving the rain sideways in stinging needles. Stafford instinctively angled his body to shield Aris from the worst of it, a simple, unconscious act of shelter.

The ute was parked right by the entrance, a solid, mud-spattered machine that looked like it could withstand a siege. Stafford unlocked it with a chirp and opened the passenger door, waiting as Aris folded his long frame into the seat. The interior was surprisingly clean, smelling faintly of sawdust and that metallic, ozone scent that clings to an electrician’s tools. It was a masculine, functional space. Stafford tossed the satchel onto the back seat, walked around, and climbed into the driver's side, the slam of his door shutting out the storm with a solid thud. For a moment, they just sat in the sudden, ringing silence, the only sound the frantic drumming of rain on the roof. Stafford turned the key and the engine rumbled to life, the heater fan kicking in with a soft whir. He angled the vents toward Aris. "Where to?"

"Newtown," Aris murmured, his voice barely a whisper. He leaned his head back against the headrest and closed his eyes. The warmth from the heater was a profound relief, slowly uncurling the tight knot of cold in his chest. He gave Stafford the name of a street lined with old Californian bungalows and pointedly didn't open his eyes again. He felt exposed, stripped of his tweed-jacketed armour, the articulate lecturer reduced to a shivering passenger. To be seen like this, so weak and dishevelled, was a humiliation. Yet, strangely, with Stafford, it felt less sharp than it should have. There was no pity in the man’s quiet competence, just a sense of purpose. He was a problem-solver, and right now, Aris was the problem to be solved.

Stafford drove with an easy, confident economy of movement, his hands sure on the wheel. The windscreen wipers beat a steady, hypnotic rhythm, clearing arcs of vision into the wet, glittering streets. He didn’t try to make small talk, and Aris was grateful for the silence. It allowed him to retreat into the warm, humming darkness of the cab. Stafford navigated the slick roads, his gaze flicking from the road to his mirrors, occasionally glancing at the pale, still figure beside him. He saw the faint tremor that still ran through Aris’s hands where they lay in his lap, the way his long lashes rested like smudges of charcoal against the translucent skin beneath his eyes. He looked younger like this, and infinitely more fragile. The protective ache Stafford had felt in the classroom solidified into something heavy and real in his chest. It was one thing to connect a wire and bring light to an empty cottage. It was another thing entirely to feel this powerful, terrifying current arcing across the space between two seats in the dark.The streets of Newtown were quiet and dark, lined with sleeping houses and trees that dripped steadily onto the nature strips. It was a different Geelong, a softer, leafier version than the hard-edged industrial zone Stafford had just left. He pulled the ute to a gentle stop outside a dark Californian bungalow. A single standard rose bush, unpruned and skeletal, clawed at the front of a wide porch, its timber peeling in the gloom. The porch light was out. Of course it was. Stafford switched off the engine, and the world was reduced to the patter of rain and the sound of Aris breathing, a shallow, hitching sound in the dark.

For a long moment, neither of them moved. Stafford could feel the heat radiating from the passenger side, a dry, feverish warmth that seemed to have a life of its own. He could leave now. His job was done. He had delivered the man home, a simple act of human decency. But the image of Aris, pale and swaying under the fluorescent lights, was seared into his mind. He knew, with the same instinct that told him a circuit was overloaded, that just leaving him on the doorstep was not an option. It would be like wiring a house and leaving the main switch off. Incomplete. Wrong.

"Alright," Aris whispered, his voice a ghost in the cab. He pushed himself upright, his movements slow and stiff. He opened his door, and the cold, damp air rushed in, smelling of wet earth and exhaust. He managed to get his feet onto the pavement, but as he tried to stand, his legs buckled. He caught himself on the open door, his knuckles white against the metal frame. Stafford was out of his own door and around the front of the ute before Aris had taken a second breath. He didn't touch him, but stood a foot away, a solid presence in the downpour. "Just get me to the door," Aris muttered, his pride a ragged flag in a losing battle. "I'll be fine." Stafford said nothing. He simply reached out and took the car keys from Aris's unresisting hand, located the house key, and walked up the two short steps to the front door.

The lock was stiff, and Stafford had to jiggle the key with practiced patience before it turned with a loud, grating click. He pushed the door open into a wall of profound darkness and a smell that was uniquely Aris: old paper, dust, and the faint, lingering aroma of black tea. "Lights are just inside to the right," Aris directed from the porch, his voice trembling with cold and exhaustion. Stafford found the switch. A low-wattage lamp flickered on, revealing a hallway that was less a corridor and more a canyon carved through mountains of books. They were stacked against the walls, piled on side tables, and teetering in columns that threatened to collapse with the next tremor. It wasn’t messy, not exactly. It was… sedimentary. The accumulated layers of a life lived in words.

Stafford turned back and held out a hand. Not to take Aris's, but as a steadying point, an offer of solid ground. Aris hesitated for a fraction of a second before his long, cool fingers wrapped around Stafford's forearm. His grip was surprisingly strong, a drowning man's grip. Stafford easily took his weight, guiding him inside and closing the door on the wind and the rain. The sudden silence of the house was absolute. He led Aris through the book canyon and into a living room where the stacks were even higher. A threadbare armchair and a long, sagging sofa were the only visible pieces of furniture, islands in a sea of print. With a gentle pressure, Stafford guided Aris down into the armchair, where he sank with a grateful, boneless sigh.

The air in the house was colder than it was outside. Stafford’s gaze swept the room, assessing. A fireplace filled with charred logs and ash. A small, unplugged oil heater in the corner. His hands flexed, itching to fix, to connect, to make warm. "Stay put," he said, the order softened by its quiet delivery. He moved through the house with a sureness that surprised them both, a man perfectly at home in a strange environment as long as there was a problem to be solved. He found the kitchen, a small, clean space that was noticeably devoid of food. There was a half-empty bottle of milk in the fridge, a jar of olives, and not much else. On the counter sat a dozen tins of exotic tea and a single, slightly bruised apple. He found a kettle, filled it, and located two mugs and a box of English Breakfast. His movements were efficient, economical. He was an expert at bringing power to cold, dark places. This was no different.

From the living room, Aris listened to the alien sounds of someone else moving through his home. The click of a cupboard, the rush of water in the pipes, the low hum of the kettle beginning to boil. He should have been mortified, his private, cluttered sanctuary breached by this quiet, practical stranger from his night class. But the fever had burned away his defences, leaving a strange, hollowed-out peace. He watched Stafford's broad-shouldered silhouette move past the doorway and felt a profound sense of dislocation. He, Aris Thorne, who could command a room with the power of a dead poet's words, was now a helpless invalid in his own home. And Stafford, the quiet electrician who sat at the back of the class, had become the protagonist. He was the one crossing the threshold, the one answering the call, while Aris had been reduced to the role of the obstacle, or perhaps, the treasure to be rescued from the dragon of his own neglect.

Stafford came back into the room carrying a steaming mug. He’d found the oil heater, plugged it in, and switched it on. A low, metallic ticking began to fill the silence as the element warmed up, and a soft orange glow pushed back against the gloom. He handed the mug to Aris, his calloused fingers brushing against Aris’s as he did so. The contact was brief, accidental, but it sent a jolt through Aris that was stronger than any fever chill. It was a current, sharp and clean and utterly unexpected. He looked up at Stafford, who was watching him with that same steady, unreadable expression. The light from the heater cast shadows up his face, making him look like something carved from stone and patience.

"Drink it," Stafford said. "There's sugar in it." He hadn't asked. He'd just known. Aris wrapped his trembling hands around the warmth of the mug and did as he was told. The tea was strong and hot, scalding a path down his throat and pooling in his stomach, a small, spreading sun. For the first time all evening, the shivering began to subside. He was still sick, still exhausted, but he was warm. He was home. And he was not alone.Stafford watched the other man’s throat work as he swallowed the tea. He didn't move from his spot in the middle of the room, standing like a pylon against the tide of books. The job wasn’t done. He’d brought power to the heater, but the house itself was failing. It had a deep, settled chill that one small appliance couldn't hope to fight. He could feel the cold seeping from the floorboards up through the soles of his boots. The system was compromised. The flickering lamp, the inadequate heating, the pale, shivering man in the chair – it was a series of faults that needed tracing, isolating, and repairing. His mind, so used to thinking in circuits and diagrams, saw the problem in stark, simple terms. The primary occupant was running on dangerously low power, and the whole structure was at risk of a total blackout.

His gaze swept the room again, this time with a more focused intent. He looked past the precarious towers of Sophocles and Homer, seeing the room for what it was: a space designed for a mind, not a body. There was no television, no comfortable clutter, no evidence of a life lived outside of the pages of a book. It was a library with a bed in it somewhere. He wondered what Aris even ate. The kitchen had been a testament to disinterest. Stafford thought of his own small, tidy unit, the freezer stocked with pre-portioned meals his mother still made for him, the fridge with its reliable quartet of milk, eggs, bacon, and beer. His life was built of simple, solid things. Aris’s was built of ideas, and it seemed a flimsy sort of architecture to withstand a winter storm.

"You've done more than enough," Aris said, his voice stronger now, bolstered by the heat and sugar. He set the half-empty mug down on a stack of books beside the chair, the ceramic making a soft clink against a hardback cover of what looked like a Latin dictionary. "I'm very grateful, Stafford. You should go home. It's late." The words were an attempt to reclaim the room, to re-establish the polite boundary between teacher and student. But the effect was ruined by the tremor that still shook his hand as he gestured vaguely towards the door, and the way he sank back into the armchair as if the small effort had cost him dearly. He was trying to dismiss his own rescuer, a king issuing edicts from a collapsing throne.

Stafford ignored him. He moved past the armchair and down the book-lined hallway, his instincts guiding him. The first door was a bathroom, cold and tiled. The second was a bedroom. He pushed the door open. The same scholarly chaos reigned. A single bed was pushed against one wall, the duvet a tangled heap. More books covered every surface, including half of the small floorspace. The room was icy, the window rattling faintly in its frame. Stafford walked over to the bed, untangled the duvet, and pulled a thick, grey woollen blanket from underneath it. It smelled faintly of cedar and disuse. He folded it over his arm and returned to the living room.

Aris watched him come back, his dark eyes wide with a kind of stunned disbelief. He looked like a startled forest creature encountering something entirely outside its experience. Stafford didn’t say a word. He walked to the armchair, leaned over, and draped the heavy blanket across Aris’s lap and chest, tucking it firmly around his shoulders. For a second, Aris stiffened at the proximity, at the sheer solid presence of him leaning into his space. Stafford’s hands were rough and sure as they secured the blanket, his movements efficient and devoid of any fuss. Then, as the weight and warmth settled over him, Aris relaxed, a long, slow exhalation of breath fogging the cold air. The blanket felt like an anchor, holding him in place, stopping him from shivering himself apart.

"I said you could go," Aris murmured into the wool, his voice muffled. It was a protest stripped of all its authority.

"And I heard you," Stafford replied, his voice a low rumble. He stepped back. "Have you got any painkillers? Panadol? Anything like that?"

A long silence. Aris seemed to be considering the question from a great distance. "I… think so. In the bathroom cabinet. Maybe."

Stafford nodded once and went to the bathroom. The cabinet was a jumble of half-used soaps, an old-fashioned shaving brush, and several bottles of prescription medication with faded labels. He found a box of paracetamol with two tablets left in the blister pack. It would have to do. He went back to the kitchen, poured a glass of water, and thought about the bruised apple on the counter. It was probably the only thing in the house that didn’t require a can opener. The kettle had re-boiled while he was searching, so he made more tea, this time without sugar, and put it all on a small, clean wooden chopping board he'd found, the only thing that could serve as a tray.

When he returned, Aris's eyes were closed, his pale face stark against the grey wool. The only spots of colour were the feverish flush high on his cheekbones. He looked younger and alarmingly fragile. Stafford placed the board on the dictionary-stack side table. "Aris," he said. His name. The first time he'd said it aloud. It felt strange and significant on his tongue. Aris’s eyes fluttered open. They were glassy, his focus swimming. "Swallow these," Stafford said, holding out the two white pills in his palm. He held the glass of water ready. Aris complied without a word, his movements slow and clumsy, like a child’s. Stafford watched to make sure he swallowed them.

"You need to eat something."

"Not hungry," Aris mumbled, his eyes slipping closed again.

"Doesn't matter," Stafford said. "Toast. I'll make you some toast." It was the most basic, comforting food he could think of. He didn't wait for an answer. Back in the kitchen, he found a loaf of rye bread in a drawer, with only a few slices left. They were slightly stale, but they would do. As he slotted them into the toaster, he leaned his hands on the counter and stared out the small kitchen window into the black, rain-lashed garden. What was he doing? He was an electrician. A sparky from Norlane who fixed fuse boxes and installed ceiling fans. He was now in his university lecturer’s kitchen at eleven o'clock on a Tuesday night, making him toast because he was too sick to look after himself. The strangeness of it should have been overwhelming, but it wasn't. It felt… correct. Like finding the one loose wire that was causing the whole system to flicker and fail, and knowing, with absolute certainty, that you were the only one there who knew how to fix it.

The toast popped up, and the simple, homely smell filled the cold kitchen. He found butter, applied it sparingly, and cut the slices into neat halves. He put them on a plate and carried them back into the living room. Aris was asleep now, or somewhere close to it. His breathing was deeper, less ragged. The flush on his cheeks had softened. The heater ticked away, its orange glow a small, defiant heart in the cold, book-filled room. Stafford put the plate down next to the tea. He wouldn't wake him. He could eat when he woke up. Stafford looked from the sleeping man to the front door, and then back again. The thought of leaving, of getting in his ute and driving back to the sterile quiet of his own unit, was impossible. It would be like walking away from a live job, tools still out, the power only half-restored. He settled into the sagging sofa opposite the armchair, the springs groaning in protest. The storm battered the windows, but inside, a fragile truce had been declared. He would stay. He would watch. He would wait for the current to stabilise.The sofa was a landscape of lumps and hostile springs, a piece of furniture that had given up on comfort decades ago. Stafford didn’t mind. He’d slept in worse places—on bags of cement during a rush job, curled in the front seat of his ute waiting for a site to open. He sat in the near-darkness, listening. The house had its own language: the groan of old timber settling, the faint rattle of a window pane in a strong gust, the whisper of dust motes shifting in the currents from the heater. And beneath it all, the rhythmic, now-steady breathing of the man in the armchair. He was a sentry on an unfamiliar post, his senses on high alert.

He let his eyes drift around the room, adjusting to the low light from the oil heater. He started trying to read the spines of the books closest to him. Most were in languages he didn't recognise—Greek, maybe, with its angular, alien letters. Others were dense hardbacks with titles like *Metaphysical Poetics* and *The Liminal State in Post-War Fiction*. It was a foreign country. His own bookshelf held a stack of trade manuals, a few dog-eared fishing magazines, and a single, thick paperback of *Dune* that a mate had insisted he read. He’d gotten fifty pages in before deciding he preferred problems he could solve with a pair of pliers. This room was the opposite of that. It was a monument to the un-fixable, to questions that only bred more questions. He wondered how a man could live surrounded by so much uncertainty and not go mad.

The initial adrenaline of the crisis had faded, leaving a deep, bone-weary tiredness in its wake. Stafford’s head grew heavy. He rested it against the dusty velvet of the sofa’s arm, his gaze fixed on Aris. The fever-flush had receded, leaving his skin with a pale, almost luminous quality in the orange glow. The sharp intelligence of his waking face had softened in sleep, the lines of stress around his eyes and mouth smoothed away. He looked unguarded, his long-limbed frame folded into the chair like a piece of intricate, broken origami. The protective ache in Stafford’s chest hadn’t lessened; it had settled, becoming a low, steady hum, a current running on a closed loop. He let his eyelids fall, just for a moment, and the sound of Aris’s breathing and the ticking heater became a strange, hypnotic lullaby.

He woke with a jolt, the kind of instant alertness that came from years of being on call. The room was changed. The wind had died down, and the rain had softened to a gentle, persistent tapping against the glass. A pre-dawn quiet had settled over the street. But the real change was in the armchair. Aris was awake. He was sitting straighter, the grey blanket pooled around his hips, and he was staring directly at Stafford. There was no surprise in his eyes, just a quiet, unnerving intensity. In the dim light, Stafford saw the plate on the book-stack beside him. The toast was gone.

For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The silence was thick with everything that had happened, with the collapsed boundaries and the unspoken questions. It was Aris who broke it, his voice raspy but clear, stripped of its lecturer’s cadence. "You're still here."

"Yeah," Stafford said. His own voice was rough with sleep. He sat up, rolling his shoulders to work out the kinks from his nap on the sofa. "Seemed like the thing to do."

Aris looked away from him then, his gaze falling to his own hands, which were resting on the blanket. His fingers were long and elegant, a scholar’s hands, but they were trembling slightly. "I don't remember much after you came back with the blanket," he said, his voice low. "It's… a bit of a blur."

"You were out of it," Stafford confirmed, keeping his tone neutral. "Fever. You drank some tea. I found some Panadol." He didn't mention making him swallow them like a child, or the way Aris’s legs had given out on the porch. Some things didn't need to be said.

"Thank you." The words were quiet, but they landed in the still room with the weight of a formal treaty. Aris looked up again, and this time, his expression was complicated. There was gratitude, yes, but also a deep, mortifying embarrassment. He was the authority figure, the man who held forth on the epic journeys of heroes, and he had been felled by a common virus, needing to be rescued by a student. "This is… profoundly humiliating."

Stafford considered this. He could see why the man would think that. But it didn't compute with his own logic. "Why?" he asked. "You were sick. People get sick. The wiring fails. The system needs a reboot. It's not a moral failing." He shrugged, a simple, solid gesture. "It's just a thing that happens."

Aris stared at him, a flicker of something—astonishment, perhaps—in his tired eyes. He seemed to take in Stafford's simple, powerful logic, processing it like a foreign text he was slowly beginning to comprehend. The idea that his physical collapse was not a source of shame but simply a mechanical fault was a completely alien concept, and yet, hearing it from Stafford, it made a strange kind of sense. He gave a small, wry smile. It was the first genuine expression Stafford had seen on his face that wasn't tinged with exhaustion or pain. "The wiring fails," he repeated softly, as if trying the phrase on for size. "An interesting metaphor."

"It's my job," Stafford said, simply. He felt the need to move, to do something. He stood up and stretched, his large frame seeming to take up all the air in the cluttered room. "Do you want more tea? Or coffee? Is there coffee?"

"Tea," Aris said quickly. "Second tin from the left on the counter. The green one." He watched Stafford walk towards the kitchen, his movements sure and economical. He was like a force of nature that had entered the dusty, static world of the house and set things in motion. The kettle clicked on, the pipes hummed. These were sounds of life, of function, sounds that had been largely absent. Aris pulled the wool blanket tighter around himself. The fever had broken, leaving him feeling hollowed out and weak, but the deep, biting chill was gone. The small oil heater, a device he hadn't used in years, pulsed out a steady, reliable warmth. Stafford hadn't just brought him home; he'd brought a kind of order to the chaos, a simple, physical logic that Aris’s house—and perhaps Aris himself—had been sorely lacking. The hero, he thought with a strange, detached irony, doesn't always carry a sword. Sometimes, he carries a pair of pliers and knows how to make the lights come on.The drive back across the city was different. The morning traffic was building, the functional, sinewy heart of Geelong beginning its daily beat. But Stafford saw it all through a new filter. The world felt sharper, the colours more saturated. The low sun glinted off the wet roads and the windows of the woolstores. He felt a hum inside him, a low-voltage current of purpose that had nothing to do with his job. He had stepped into another person’s life, found it failing, and performed a repair. It was a feeling more satisfying than any paycheck. He wasn't just connecting wires anymore; he was connecting to something else, something human and complicated and utterly compelling.

He went to work. The rest of the day was a predictable rhythm of call-outs and routine maintenance. A faulty power point in a Belmont cafe, a new lighting rig for a mechanic's workshop in Moolap. He worked with his usual quiet competence, his hands moving through familiar motions. But his mind was elsewhere. It was in a cold, book-filled house in Newtown. He kept seeing Aris’s face, the way it had looked in the feverish orange glow of the heater, the astonishment in his eyes when Stafford had simply offered to help. He thought about the bruised apple on the counter and the empty fridge. He found himself at a supermarket during his lunch break, standing in the produce aisle, a plastic bag in his hand. He bought apples, oranges, a bunch of bananas. He bought a carton of soup, a block of cheese, a loaf of proper, fresh bread. He bought it all without a clear plan, acting on an instinct that was as powerful and direct as a magnetic pull.

That evening, after finishing his last job, he didn't drive home. He drove back towards Newtown. He told himself it was just to check. A follow-up, like he'd do on a tricky wiring job. To make sure the fix had held. It was a flimsy excuse and he knew it. He parked his ute a few houses down the street, not directly in front this time. The porch light he had fixed was a welcoming yellow beacon in the encroaching twilight. He sat for a moment, the bag of groceries a solid weight on the passenger seat beside him. This was the dangerous part. Last night had been a crisis, an emergency. This was a choice. This was crossing the threshold again, deliberately this time, without the excuse of a call to adventure. This was just… showing up.

He got out of the ute, took the grocery bag, and walked up the path. He felt a nervousness in his gut that was entirely new to him. He could face down a live switchboard without flinching, but the simple act of knocking on this door felt momentous. He raised his hand and knocked, two solid, deliberate raps on the old timber. He waited. He heard a slow shuffle from inside, and then the door opened. Aris stood there. He was dressed in a thick, dark woolen jumper and trousers, not the threadbare clothes of the night before. His hair was damp, as if he’d just showered. He looked tired, but the fever was gone. He was pale, but his eyes were clear. And they were wide with shock as they took in Stafford, standing on his porch, holding a bag of groceries.

"Stafford," he said, his voice quiet. He looked from Stafford's face to the bag and back again. He looked utterly bewildered, as if a character from one of his epic poems had inexplicably materialized on his doorstep. "What are you doing here?"

"I was in the area," Stafford lied, the words feeling clumsy. "Just thought I'd check that the light was holding." He hefted the bag slightly. "And I figured your fridge was looking a bit tragic." There was no judgment in his voice, just a statement of fact. He wasn’t offering charity; he was addressing a logistical problem. The system needed fuel to run. He was providing the fuel. It was that simple.

Aris stared at him, and a thousand emotions seemed to cross his face at once: confusion, embarrassment, a flicker of guarded anger at the intrusion, and then, something else, something softer. He stepped back from the doorway, a silent, grudging invitation. “You are the most peculiar man I have ever met,” he said, as Stafford stepped past him into the hall. The house was still cold, but the air of crisis had dissipated. It was just a quiet, cluttered house now. Stafford walked past the book stacks towards the kitchen as if he'd been doing it his whole life.

"I'll put these away," Stafford said, already opening the fridge. The bare white interior seemed to confirm his assessment. He began to load the soup, the cheese, the milk he’d also bought into its empty shelves. Aris followed him and leaned against the doorframe, his arms crossed over his chest. It was a defensive posture, but his gaze was one of genuine, baffled curiosity. He was observing Stafford like a new species, trying to understand his motivations, his internal wiring.

"You don't have to do this," Aris said, his voice tight with a lifetime of self-sufficiency. "I am perfectly capable of buying my own groceries."

"I know," Stafford said, not looking at him as he placed the fruit in a bowl on the counter. "But you weren't going to, were you? Not today." He closed the fridge door and finally turned to face Aris. "People need looking after sometimes. It's not complicated." In Stafford’s world, it really wasn't. If a mate's car broke down, you gave him a lift. If a neighbour's fence blew over, you helped him fix it. This was no different. He saw a problem and he applied the solution. The fact that the problem was a man who lectured on Greek mythology was an irrelevant detail.The statement hung in the air between them, as stark and simple as a copper wire. *People need looking after sometimes. It's not complicated.* Aris found the simplicity of it both galling and undeniable. In his world, nothing was uncomplicated. Human motivation was a labyrinth of history, desire, and subconscious drives, a text to be deconstructed and endlessly analysed. He had spent his life navigating these complexities, both in literature and in his own carefully constructed solitude. Yet here was Stafford, a man who seemed to move through the world as if it were a wiring diagram, a series of logical connections that were either right or wrong, live or dead. He had seen a fault and he had, without question or deliberation, set about fixing it.

Stafford wiped his hands on his jeans, his task complete. He wasn’t lingering. He cast a professional eye around the small kitchen, his gaze catching on the fluorescent tube above the sink, which gave a weak, intermittent flicker. "That light's got a bad starter," he noted, his tone the same one he might use with a client. "And the tap's dripping. You'll want to get a new washer for that. Costs you a fortune in water bills over a year." He wasn't criticising; he was diagnosing. He saw a system in a state of minor disrepair, and it was his nature to point out the faults.

This, at last, was familiar territory for Aris. A transaction. He seized on it like a lifeline, a way to pull their strange encounter back into a recognisable shape. "I can pay you," he said, the words coming out a little too quickly. "For your time. For the groceries, of course. And for fixing the porch light. If you could… look at the starter and the tap, I would compensate you for that as well." He could turn Stafford back into a tradesman, and himself back into a client. The world would click back onto its proper axis. The hierarchy would be restored. It was a way to reclaim the dignity that he felt had been stripped from him, laid bare on his own dusty floor.

Stafford’s head tilted slightly. He looked at Aris, really looked at him, and for the first time, a flicker of something other than calm competence crossed his face. It was a faint, almost imperceptible-exasperation, as if Aris were a particularly stubborn bolt that refused to turn. "It's not a job, mate," he said, and the casual, Aussie term of address was more disarming than any argument. It was a word that levelled the space between them, brushing aside the lectern and the tweed jacket and the PhD. It was a word that suggested a shared and simple context that Aris had never been a part of. Stafford shook his head, a small, definitive gesture. "I'm not sending you a bill."

The refusal, so quiet and absolute, left Aris nowhere to go. His offer of payment had been his last line of defence, and Stafford had walked right past it. He was left standing in his own kitchen, a stranger in his own life, watching this man who refused to behave according to any of the rules Aris understood. The frustration inside him was a tight, hot knot. He had lost control of the narrative completely. "Then why?" he demanded, the question finally breaking free, raw and stripped of academic pretence. "Why are you doing this? You've brought me home, you've stayed the night, now you're stocking my larder as if I were some kind of… charity case. What do you want?"

Stafford leaned back against the counter, crossing his arms over his broad chest. He seemed to consider the question with a seriousness that Aris hadn't expected. He wasn’t a man given to introspection, and the question forced him to look at the wires inside himself. He looked past Aris, towards the hallway and the shadowy mountains of books. "That first night of class," he began, his voice low and thoughtful. "You talked about the inciting incident. The moment the world… tilts. You said it reveals itself to be stranger, and more beautiful." He brought his gaze back to Aris, and it was direct, as unwavering as a pilot light. "I don't know. I guess my wiring's changed since then. I see things differently." He gave a small shrug, as if embarrassed by the admission. "You looked like you needed a hand. It's not more complicated than that."

The explanation landed in the quiet kitchen with the force of a revelation. It was an answer Aris could never have anticipated. Stafford had taken his lecture, his abstract intellectual exercise on the architecture of narrative, and treated it as a practical instruction manual. He had heard the call to adventure and had simply answered it, with the same methodical approach he would use to repair a faulty circuit. It wasn't pity that had brought him here. It was a consequence. A direct result of Aris's own words being set loose in the world. The profound, staggering irony of it silenced him completely. He, the storyteller, had unwittingly written a hero into his own life, and the hero had turned out to be the quiet electrician from the back row.

Stafford, having articulated something he hadn't fully understood himself until he said it, seemed to decide the conversation had run its course. The silence felt too much like empty space, and he was a man who preferred things to be connected and complete. "Right, then," he said, pushing himself off the counter. "You've got food. The heater works. Drink the tea." It was a checklist. A job completion report. He started towards the front door, his work boots solid and reassuring on the floorboards. "Get some rest. You still look half-dead."

Aris didn't move from the kitchen doorway. He simply watched Stafford walk away. He watched him open the front door without a backward glance, letting in a brief rush of cool night air, and then close it firmly behind him. The click of the latch was loud in the sudden silence. Aris was alone again in his house of books and shadows. But something had fundamentally changed. It wasn't just the hum of the fridge or the new loaf of bread on the counter. A current had been introduced into the closed, dusty system of his life. The house was no longer a fortress. A door had been opened, and he had a terrible, thrilling suspicion that it could no longer be shut.The week that followed was a study in altered states. For Aris, his own home had become a foreign country. He would wake in the pre-dawn quiet and the first thing he would register was not the familiar silence, but a low, electric hum from the kitchen. The refrigerator. He had owned it for a decade, but he had never truly heard it until now. It was the sound of function, of potential. When he walked into the kitchen, the sight of the fruit in the bowl on his counter—oranges and apples, glowing like jewels in the grey light—was a small, persistent shock. It was evidence. An artifact left behind by an invading force, a force that had breached his walls not with violence, but with soup and a loaf of bread. He felt a phantom shame, a hot flush of humiliation at his own revealed incompetence. He, a man who could navigate the labyrinthine syntax of Joyce, had been deemed incapable of feeding himself. But beneath the shame, another feeling festered, something more complex and frightening: a profound, unnerving sense of being seen.

He spent the first few days in a state of convalescent lethargy, moving slowly through the canyons of his books. He ate the food Stafford had brought. Each slice of toast, each spoonful of soup, felt like a concession, an act of surrender. He would sit in his threadbare armchair, the grey woollen blanket over his knees, and try to read. But the words on the page felt distant. The epic struggles of Achaean heroes seemed bloodless compared to the memory of Stafford’s calloused hand holding out two white pills, his quiet voice cutting through the fever-haze with an order that was also, impossibly, an act of grace. He tried to categorize the man, to fit him into an archetype. The noble savage? The gruff but gentle giant? Every label felt cheap and inadequate. Stafford wasn't a character. He was a fact, as solid and inexplicable as the bag of oranges on his counter. The house was no longer just his. It was now a place where Stafford had been, and the memory of his presence lingered in the repaired light switch and the steady warmth from the oil heater.

For Stafford, the week was a low-grade hum of distraction. He was on a job in Lara, rewiring an old farmhouse, his body going through the familiar, comforting motions: stripping wires, twisting connections, reading the faded diagrams of a system built fifty years ago. But his mind was not on the ghost currents in the old walls. It was in Newtown. He'd find himself pausing, pliers in hand, staring at a junction box while the memory of Aris’s pale, sleeping face surfaced unbidden. He'd worry, with an anxiety that was entirely foreign to him, about whether the man was eating. Had he overstepped? The thought circled him like a hungry dog. His world was one of clear rules: you don't leave a job half-finished, you don't mix live and neutral, you don't get involved in a client's personal life. He had broken that last rule so completely he hadn't just crossed a line, he'd rewired the entire board. The uncertainty of it was a current he didn't know how to ground. He found himself watching the clock, counting the days, not to Friday, but to Tuesday.

When Tuesday came, the air in the TAFE lecture hall was thick with a familiar, bland normality. The smell of floor polish, the squeak of plastic chairs, the low murmur of the other students. For Stafford, sitting in his usual seat at the back, it felt like a stage set for a play that had already ended. He felt a tightness in his chest, a live wire of apprehension. He watched the door, waiting. What if Aris didn't show? What if he did, and he simply pretended nothing had happened, his public persona a perfect, impenetrable mask? The thought was strangely devastating. It would mean the connection was faulty, a brief short-circuit that had been repaired, leaving no trace. The retired librarian was arranging her thermos and biscuits. The young art student was sketching in her notebook. It was the ordinary world, functioning as it should.

Then the door opened and Aris walked in. He was precisely on time. He wore a different tweed jacket, a dark, herringbone wool, and a crisp shirt. He looked rested, his movements fluid and sure. He looked, to Stafford’s intense disappointment, completely normal. He placed his leather satchel on the lectern, surveyed the room with a calm, professional gaze, and his eyes swept right over Stafford as if he were just another plastic chair. A cold weight settled in Stafford's gut. He had been a temporary repairman, a service that was no longer required. The lecturer had been restored to factory settings.

"Good evening," Aris began, his voice the smooth, melodic instrument Stafford remembered from the first night. The gravel of illness was gone. "Last week, we discussed the inciting incident, the call that disrupts the hero’s world. Tonight, I want to talk about what happens after. Specifically, about the ancient Greek concept of *xenia*." He paced, his familiar restless energy returned. "It translates, imperfectly, as 'guest-friendship'. But it's more than that. It was a sacred, reciprocal obligation. A host had a divine duty to take in a stranger, to offer them food, drink, a bath, a place to rest—before even asking their name. The guest, in turn, had a duty to be gracious, to not abuse that hospitality, and to offer a gift or service in return when they were able."

He paused, his eyes sweeping the room again. He spoke of Odysseus, washed up on the shores of Scheria, naked and desperate, and how Princess Nausicaa, instead of recoiling, saw her duty and brought him into the heart of her family’s palace. He talked about the bond it created, a circuit of obligation and gratitude that was more powerful than a business contract, a bond that could echo down through generations.

"Accepting that hospitality," Aris continued, his voice dropping slightly, "is as crucial as offering it. To accept help is to acknowledge a need. It is an act of profound vulnerability. It creates a debt. Not a financial debt," he clarified, his gaze flicking, just for a second, towards the back of the room, "but a human one. It rewrites the relationship between the two parties, irrevocably. They are no longer stranger and host. They are bound."

In that moment, his eyes met Stafford's. It wasn't a fleeting glance. It was a direct, deliberate connection across the brightly lit room. The air between them seemed to crackle, to become a live medium. The lecture was no longer a lecture. It was a message. It was a meticulously crafted, academically fortified explanation. It was Aris Thorne, using the only language he was truly fluent in, to say everything he couldn’t say in his own kitchen. He was telling Stafford that he understood. That what had happened between them was not a simple transaction to be forgotten, but a story that now had two protagonists, bound by the ancient laws of narrative and need.

The hour ended. The students began to pack their things, their chatter filling the room. Stafford sat still for a moment, the hum in his own chest finally steady, the circuit stable. He slowly zipped his tool bag, the sound loud in his own ears. He felt a sense of quiet resolution. He had been heard. He stood up to leave with the others, turning towards the aisle.

"Stafford."

The voice was quiet, cutting through the ambient noise of the departing class. It was Aris. He was standing by the lectern, his satchel in his hand, making no move to leave. He was waiting. The last of the other students shuffled out the door, leaving the two of them alone in the empty, silent room. The fluorescent lights hummed above them, the same harsh lights that had illuminated a sick, swaying man a week ago. Now they illuminated a man who stood tall, his gaze direct and filled with a terrifying, beautiful clarity.Stafford turned, his tool bag held loosely in his hand. The weight of it felt familiar and grounding in the suddenly charged atmosphere of the room. He didn't walk back towards the lectern, but he didn't leave either. He simply stood his ground in the aisle, creating a clear space of about ten feet between them, a no-man's-land of squeaky linoleum. The hum of the lights seemed to grow louder, filling the void left by the departed students. Aris hadn't moved. He stood behind his lectern as if it were a shield, but his hands weren't resting on it. They were clasped in front of him, the knuckles of one hand white where they pressed into the back of the other.

"That was..." Stafford began, then stopped, searching for the right word. He wasn't a man who trafficked in complex analysis. "That was a hell of a way to say thanks."

A faint smile touched Aris’s lips, a brief, self-deprecating flicker. "As I believe I demonstrated, it's the only way I truly know how. I apologise if it was overly theatrical. Old habits." He unclasped his hands and finally picked up his leather satchel, the gesture seeming to signal a shift, a move from the abstract to the concrete. He walked around the lectern, closing half the distance between them. The move felt significant, a deliberate abandonment of his position of authority. Now he was just a man in a tweed jacket, standing in a beige room. "My lecture, however, was incomplete. It lacked the final, crucial component."

Stafford waited, his expression unreadable. He had done his part. He had identified the fault, performed the repair, and confirmed the system was stable. In his world, the job was now finished. But he was beginning to understand that Aris operated on a different kind of schematic, one with circuits of obligation and currents of meaning that Stafford was only just beginning to perceive. He had a feeling he was about to be presented with a new, more complicated diagram.

"The guest-friendship, the *xenia*, is reciprocal," Aris said, his voice softer now, stripped of its performance. "The host offers shelter. The guest, when they are able, offers a gift. A story. A service. A return of hospitality. It is my turn, Stafford." He paused, and for the first time, Stafford saw a flicker of genuine uncertainty in his eyes. The articulate lecturer was gone, replaced by someone navigating without a map. "I was wondering if you would allow me to buy you a drink."

The offer was so simple, so normal, it was almost jarring. After a week of internal turmoil and a lecture on the sacred duties of the ancient Greeks, it all came down to a beer. Stafford felt a slow smile spread across his own face. It wasn't a grin, just an easing of the tension in his jaw. This, he could understand. This was a clear and direct proposal. A to B. "Yeah," he said, the single word a solid, affirmative click. "Alright."

They drove in separate vehicles, a silent acknowledgment that they were still two separate entities, orbiting each other cautiously. Stafford followed the respectable European sedan with his hulking, mud-splattered ute. He watched its tail lights through the gathering dark, a strange sense of surrealism settling over him. He was following his teacher to a pub on a Tuesday night. Eight weeks ago, his Tuesdays had consisted of a microwave meal and two hours of mindless television before an early night. Now, he was part of a narrative he didn't understand, written in a language he couldn't read, but he was following the plot anyway.

Aris led them not to one of the new, trendy wine bars that were popping up along the waterfront, but to an old corner pub on a quiet backstreet, a place of dark brick and leadlight windows. The sign, swinging in the cool breeze, just said ‘Hotel’. It was a place Stafford knew, a pub where old men nursed pots of beer and the TAB was always on in the corner. It was Stafford’s world, not Aris’s, and he wondered if the choice was deliberate. A gesture.

Inside, it smelled of stale beer, woodsmoke from a long-dead fire, and fried onions. The murmur of conversation was a low, comfortable drone. They found a small, dark wooden booth in a corner, the vinyl on the seats cracked with age. A kind of nervous quiet settled between them, the easy dynamic of teacher-and-student, rescuer-and-rescued, stripped away by the sheer ordinariness of the pub. Stafford slid his tool bag under the table, feeling suddenly self-conscious of it. Aris placed his leather satchel on the seat beside him, a similar gesture of setting aside the tools of one’s trade.

"What are you having?" Stafford asked, his voice a little too loud in the booth.

"What would you recommend?" Aris countered, looking around as if taking anthropological notes.

"A pot of Carlton Draught," Stafford said without hesitation.

"Then I shall have the same," Aris replied, a decision that felt both like an attempt to fit in and a quiet act of trust.

Stafford went to the bar. He felt the eyes of a few of the regulars on him as he returned with the two glasses, their amber contents glowing in the dim light. He put one down on the worn coaster in front of Aris. He slid into his side of the booth. For a moment they just sat there, looking at the two identical glasses of beer that stood between them like a treaty. Aris picked his up, his long fingers looking elegant and out of place wrapped around the simple, heavy glass. He raised it slightly. "To guest-friendships," he said, his mouth twisted in a wry, small smile.

"To fixing things," Stafford replied, and clinked his glass against Aris's. The sound was a dull, solid thud. They both drank. The beer was cold and sharp. Stafford drank half his pot in one go, a familiar comfort. Aris took a more measured, thoughtful sip, his eyes closing for a moment as he registered the taste. He set the glass down carefully.

"So," he said, his gaze falling to Stafford’s hands where they rested on the table. They were clean, but the skin was rough, the knuckles scarred, a faint tracery of lines etched around the nails that no amount of scrubbing could ever fully remove. "The man who fixes things. What is it that you like about it? The work."

The question surprised Stafford. People didn't ask him what he liked about his job. They asked him if he could have a look at their flickering lights while he was there. He thought about it for a moment, swirling the remaining beer in his glass. "It's logical," he said finally. "There's always an answer. Something's broken, and you find the break. You make the connection again. And then… there's light. It's finished. You can see the result. It makes sense."

Aris nodded slowly, his eyes thoughtful. "A world of definite answers. It must be… peaceful."

"Is yours not?" Stafford asked, turning the question back on him. He gestured with his head towards the satchel on the seat. "All those books."

"My world?" Aris gave a short, humourless laugh. "My world is a labyrinth of questions that only lead to more questions. There are no definite answers, only interpretations. Nothing is ever finished, it's just… abandoned. It's the furthest thing from peaceful." He took another sip of his beer, seeming to ponder this. "Perhaps that's why I found what you did so… compelling. It was an act of absolute, unambiguous sense in the midst of chaos." He paused, then his gaze became more direct. "I didn’t get a new washer for the tap. I wouldn’t know where to begin."

The admission was quiet, but it felt as intimate as any of the week's previous events. It was a confession of a different kind of incompetence, one that was, for Stafford, completely baffling. How could a man so brilliant not know how to change a tap washer? "I can show you," Stafford heard himself say. "It's easy." The offer was out before he'd had a chance to think about it, a reflex. See a problem, offer a solution.

Aris looked at him, and the corner of his mouth twitched, this time with genuine amusement. "Stafford, are you offering to give me plumbing lessons?"

"If you want them," Stafford said with a shrug, feeling a warmth spread through his chest that had nothing to do with the beer. "It's a useful thing to know."

"I am beginning to suspect," Aris said, his voice low and laced with a wonder he didn’t try to hide, "that you are full of useful things to know." He held Stafford’s gaze across the small table, and in the dim, smoky light of the old pub, surrounded by the ghosts of a thousand other unremarkable Tuesdays, the world tilted again. Not with the frantic lurch of a crisis, but with the slow, deliberate, and terrifying shift of a foundation settling into a new, permanent position.That silent, foundational shift held for a long moment, a new equilibrium established in the dusty corner of the old pub. The sounds of the bar—the clink of glasses, the low murmur of a footy argument, the whir of the cooler—all seemed to fade into a distant hum. Stafford felt the intense focus of Aris’s gaze, and for the first time, he didn't feel the need to look away or break the connection with a practical observation. He simply met it. The warmth in his chest had settled into something steady and solid. He took another swallow of his beer, the familiar taste grounding him. It was Aris who finally broke the spell, looking down into his own half-empty glass as if it held the answer to a complex equation.

"So," Aris said, his voice returning to a more level, conversational tone. "Plumbing lessons. When would be a convenient time for my tutelage to begin?" There was a teasing lightness to his words, but the question underneath was genuine. He was committing to the offer, following the strange new current of their interaction wherever it might lead.

Stafford, back on solid ground, consulted a mental calendar of jobs and commitments. His world was one of schedules and appointments, and this new, un-billable appointment needed to be slotted in with the same seriousness. "Saturday's good," he said. "I'm working a half-day in Herne Hill, should be done by lunchtime. I could come by around one?"

"One o'clock on Saturday," Aris repeated, the words sounding formal and strange in the context of the shabby pub. He nodded. "That would be… excellent." They finished their drinks in a comfortable quiet, the earlier nervousness replaced by a sense of settled purpose. There was no need for small talk. The terms had been agreed upon, the next meeting set. The silence wasn't empty; it was waiting. When they stood to leave, the ordinary sounds of the pub rushed back in. Stafford shouldered his tool bag, the familiar weight a comfort. Aris clutched his satchel of books. They were two men from different worlds, standing together under the dim lights, about to walk out into the same night.

Outside, the air was cool and clean. The street was quiet, their footsteps echoing slightly on the pavement as they walked towards their parked vehicles. It was a short walk, but it felt charged with unspoken potential. They stopped between the hulking ute and the sleek sedan, an island of asphalt separating their two lives. "Well," Aris said, fumbling slightly for his car keys. "Thank you for the beer. And for… everything else." The last two words were quiet, but they encompassed a whole week of chaos and revelation.

"It was just a beer," Stafford said, instinctively downplaying the significance of the evening, of everything. He nodded towards Aris's car. "Drive safe." He turned and walked to his ute without looking back. He didn't want to see the expression on Aris's face. He wasn't equipped to interpret it. He just knew, as he started the engine and watched Aris’s headlights flick on in his rearview mirror, that seeing him on Tuesday in a classroom would no longer be enough. He needed Saturday to come. He needed to see if this strange new connection would hold in the clear light of day.

Saturday arrived bright and unseasonably mild, the kind of late winter day that tricked you into believing spring was just around the corner. The sky over Geelong was a pale, washed-out blue. Stafford finished his job in Herne Hill early, a simple switchboard upgrade that went smoothly, everything connecting just as the diagram said it should. He went home first, a detour he didn't consciously question. He showered, changing out of his work-worn clothes into a clean, dark blue t-shirt and fresh jeans. He looked at his main toolbox, the big steel case full of everything he needed to wire a house from scratch, and decided against it. This wasn't a job. He selected a small wrench, a roll of plumber's tape, a multi-tool, and a handful of different-sized tap washers from a spare parts tin. He put them in a small canvas pouch, a stark contrast to the heavy-duty gear he usually carried.

Driving to Newtown, he felt the same unfamiliar nervousness he'd felt knocking on Aris's door with the groceries. This was different. This was an appointment. An arrangement between two people, not a crisis intervention. He parked on the street and walked up the familiar path. The garden was still a tangled mess, but in the sunlight, he could see the tight, promising buds on the skeletal rose bush. He knocked on the door at one o’clock precisely.

Aris opened it almost immediately, as if he had been waiting just on the other side. He wasn't wearing his tweed uniform. He was in a simple, soft-looking grey jumper and dark trousers. He looked younger without the academic armour, and there was a nervous energy about him that was entirely different from his feverish restlessness. His house, too, was different in the daylight. The sunlight, streaming through the front windows, illuminated the sheer volume of dust motes dancing in the air, but it also made the space feel less like a gloomy cave and more like a scholar’s slightly chaotic den. "Stafford," he said, stepping back. "You're punctual."

"Always," Stafford replied, stepping inside. He held up the small canvas pouch. "Got the tools."

"Excellent," Aris said, a little too brightly. "The patient is this way." He led Stafford not to the kitchen, but down the hall to the small, cold bathroom Stafford had only briefly glanced into before. The room was stark and functional, the white tiles making the space feel clinical. And there it was: the steady, maddening *plink… plink… plink* of a water droplet hitting the porcelain basin. It was the only sound in the room, a tiny, persistent signal of a system in failure. Aris gestured towards the sink with a theatrical sweep of his hand. "Behold. My nemesis."

Stafford set his pouch on the edge of the bath and leaned over the sink, his presence immediately filling the small room. He turned the handle of the tap. It was stiff, and a faint squeal protested the movement. "Right," he said, turning back to Aris, who was hovering uncertainly in the doorway. "First thing. You have to turn the water off at the mains. Otherwise you're going to have a fountain in here. You know where your water meter is?" Aris stared at him, his expression completely, utterly blank. Stafford sighed, a quiet, fond sound of exasperation. "Never mind. Show me the front yard." The lesson had begun.They stood in the tangled wilderness of Aris’s front garden, a place that had clearly been surrendered to nature’s slow, indifferent siege. Weeds grew thick and tenacious in the cracked paving stones, and a sprawling, untamed lavender bush had all but consumed the path. Aris looked around with the vague, helpless air of a man seeing his own property for the first time. Stafford ignored the botanical chaos, his eyes scanning the base of the house, looking for the tell-tale signs. He found it near the front corner, a small, circular metal lid almost completely hidden beneath a mat of dead leaves and creeping ivy. He kicked the debris away with the side of his boot, crouched down, and pried the lid open with his fingers. Inside was the meter, a small brass valve beside it.

"This is it," Stafford said, pointing. "This is your main shut-off. If a pipe ever bursts, this is the first thing you do. Lefty-loosey, righty-tighty. That's all you need to remember." He looked up at Aris, who was staring down at the small, crucial mechanism with a look of profound wonder, as if Stafford had just revealed the secret heart of a pyramid. "Go on, you do it. Just turn it clockwise until it stops." Aris crouched down, his movements hesitant and awkward. His long, scholar’s fingers, so at home on the pages of a book, looked alien as they grasped the cold, stiff valve. He put his weight into it, his knuckles turning white, and with a protesting groan of metal, the valve turned. A shudder ran through the pipes in the house, a low groan that ended in a final, gurgling sigh. The water was off. Aris looked at his own hand, then at Stafford, a small, genuine smile of accomplishment on his face. It was a tiny victory, but a victory nonetheless.

Back in the confines of the bathroom, the silence was absolute. The absence of the drip was a palpable presence. Stafford’s broad shoulders seemed to take up all the available space, forcing Aris to stand closer to him than he would have otherwise, his own back almost touching the cool tiles of the wall. Stafford laid out the small canvas pouch on the closed toilet lid and unrolled it, revealing the handful of tools. They looked simple, almost primitive. He picked up the wrench and handed it to Aris. "Okay. This is the tricky bit. You've got to grip the base of the tap here," he said, his own rough hand covering Aris's, guiding it into place, "and then use the wrench on the hexagonal nut just above it. You need to hold the base steady so you don't twist the whole pipe underneath."

Stafford's hand was warm and heavy over his. Aris felt a jolt, a clean, high-voltage shock that had nothing to do with electricity. He froze, every thought in his head evaporating, leaving only the startling, solid reality of Stafford's touch. He could feel the calluses on Stafford's palm, the sheer physical competence contained within his grip. Stafford didn't seem to notice, his focus entirely on the task. "Feel that? You're just holding it still. Now, take the wrench with your other hand." Aris moved as if in a trance, his movements clumsy. Stafford leaned in closer, his head next to Aris’s, his breath warm against Aris’s temple as he pointed. "Right there. Get a good grip on it. That's it. Now turn. It'll be stiff." Aris turned the wrench. The nut resisted, then gave way with a sharp crack. Under Stafford’s quiet, patient instruction, he disassembled the top of the tap, laying the components out on the side of the sink: the handle, the housing, the spindle. At the bottom of the spindle was a small, black, washer, warped and split. "There's your problem," Stafford said, his voice a low rumble so close to Aris's ear. "It's perished. The seal's broken."

He picked the old washer off with the tip of a screwdriver and selected a new one from the small assortment he'd brought. It was a perfect, tiny black doughnut of flawless rubber. He showed Aris how to fit it, how to reassemble the spindle, and how to grease the threads before screwing it all back together. He had Aris do every step, his own hands hovering nearby, ready to guide or steady, a constant, reassuring presence. The whole process took less than ten minutes. When it was done, the tap looked exactly as it had before, but they both knew it was fundamentally changed. It was fixed. "Okay," Stafford said, stepping back and finally creating some space in the small room. "Go turn the mains back on. And do it slowly. Let the pipes fill up gently."

Aris walked out of the bathroom feeling dazed, his skin still tingling where Stafford had touched him. He went to the front yard and reversed the process, turning the valve anti-clockwise. He heard the water rush back into the house, a sighing, gurgling awakening. He returned to the bathroom to find Stafford wiping down the sink with a piece of toilet paper, leaving the space cleaner than he'd found it. He looked up as Aris entered. "Moment of truth," he said. Aris reached out, his hand now confident, and turned the tap. A smooth, silent stream of water flowed into the basin. He turned it off. The flow stopped instantly. There was no whine, no shudder, and, most importantly, no drip. The silence that followed was complete and satisfying. It was the sound of order restored.

"It's quiet," Aris said, the words full of a ridiculous, profound relief. He looked at Stafford, who was packing the last of his tools into the canvas pouch, his work done. The pretext for the visit was over. A sudden, sharp panic flared in Aris's chest at the thought of Stafford just walking out the door, the fragile connection they'd built dissolving now that the problem was solved. He couldn't let that happen. "Stafford," he said, his voice firmer than he expected it to be. "I believe it is my turn to fulfill the obligations of *xenia* once more. The host must offer food and drink. Would you stay for lunch? I think there might be some soup. You bought it, after all." The last part came out with a self-deprecating wryness that softened the formality of the invitation. Stafford looked up from his pouch, a slow smile spreading across his face, reaching his eyes. It transformed his usually stoic expression into something open and warm. "Yeah," he said. "Soup sounds good."They moved from the sterile white of the bathroom into the warmer, book-lined artery of the hallway. The house felt different, woken up. The flow of water through its pipes was a resurrected pulse, and the silence from the fixed tap was a quiet triumph they shared. In the kitchen, Aris opened his refrigerator with a flourish that was only slightly undermined by his unfamiliarity with its contents. He peered inside as if examining an archeological display. The carton of soup, the block of cheese, the fresh milk—they were alien artifacts in their native land. He located the carton of tomato soup and placed it on the counter with a decisive thud.

"Lunch," he announced, as if he had just successfully hunted and gathered it himself. He turned to the cupboards, opening one, then another, his search growing more frantic. A faint line of worry appeared between his brows. Stafford leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, watching the performance with a quiet amusement. He had a strong suspicion Aris was looking for a saucepan, and an even stronger one that he might not own one that wasn't coated in a sedimentary layer of old tea stains.

"Problem?" Stafford asked, his voice gentle.

Aris stopped, turning from a cupboard filled with nothing but an alarming number of biscuit tins. He let out a sigh of defeat. "I appear to be… under-equipped for culinary pursuits. I was fairly certain there was a pot in here somewhere. It seems to have migrated." The admission was laced with a frustration directed entirely at himself. Here he was, attempting a simple act of reciprocal hospitality, and he was failing at the first hurdle. He was Odysseus, trying to string his own bow and finding his muscles had atrophied.

Stafford pushed himself off the doorframe. "Let's have a look." It wasn't a takeover; it was a suggestion of teamwork. He began to open cupboards on the other side of the kitchen, his movements methodical. The contents were a strange mix of the highly specific and the deeply neglected: a tagine that had never been used, an antique coffee grinder, three different kinds of tea strainer, but no pots. Finally, in a low cupboard behind a stack of old newspapers, Stafford found it. A small, stainless-steel saucepan, dusty but serviceable. He held it up like a trophy. "Found it."

A genuine, relieved smile broke across Aris's face. "My hero," he said, the words light and ironic, yet carrying a faint, unmistakable echo of sincerity. Stafford felt a flush of heat rise in his neck. He handed the pot to Aris, their fingers brushing for a second time that day. This time, the contact was less of a jolt and more of a low, pleasant hum. While Aris rinsed the pan with a newfound appreciation for his silent tap, Stafford found the slightly stale loaf of rye bread and two plates. He located the toaster and slotted two slices in, the small, domestic act feeling both strange and perfectly natural in the quiet kitchen. They moved around each other in the confined space, a clumsy but effective ballet of shared purpose.

They ate at a small, round table in a corner of the living room, a space Stafford had cleared by creating a new, more stable-looking stack of books against the wall. The soup was hot and simple, and they ate in a comfortable silence for a few minutes. The sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating the towers of words that surrounded them. It was Stafford who spoke first, gesturing with his spoon at the nearest stack. "So all of these… this is for your work?"

"Some of it," Aris said, after swallowing a mouthful of soup. "Some of it is just… accumulation. It's hard to get rid of them. Each one is a world, a conversation. Throwing one away feels like silencing a voice." He looked around at the towering stacks with a familiar, weary affection. "My parents were librarians. I grew up in a house much like this. I suppose I never learned another way to live." It was a piece of personal history offered up freely, a stark contrast to his usual guardedness.

"My dad was a sparky," Stafford offered in return. "His dad, too. I learned the trade from them. It's all I've ever done." He thought of his father's workshop, the neat rows of tools on the pegboard, the smell of ozone and solder, a different kind of library altogether. "He always said, 'If you can't fix it, you don't really own it'."

Aris considered this, his head tilted. "A compelling philosophy. A little terrifying for a man who just learned what a main shut-off valve is, but compelling nonetheless." He took a bite of toast. "Does it ever bore you? The logic of it. The predictability. Don't you ever want the surprise of a system that doesn't work the way it's supposed to, a ghost in the machine?"

Stafford thought for a moment. He thought of old wiring in century-old houses, circuits that made no sense according to modern diagrams, strange fixes and workarounds made by long-dead tradesmen. "There's always surprises," he said. "Things are never as simple as the diagram. People make things complicated. You have to read the history of the house, sometimes, not just the plan. You have to figure out what the last bloke was thinking." He looked at Aris. "It's a kind of storytelling, I guess."

The words hung in the air. Stafford, connecting his own methodical work to Aris's abstract world, had bridged the gap between them with a single, startling observation. Aris stared at him, his spoon halfway to his mouth. He had spent his life teaching students to find the narrative in art, in history, in poetry. It had never once occurred to him that a man might find it in a fuse box. The idea was so unexpected, so brilliant in its simplicity, that it left him momentarily speechless. He felt a profound sense of realignment, as if a new, critical wire had just been connected in his own understanding of the world. "Yes," he said, his voice quiet with awe. "Yes, I suppose it is."The silence that followed Stafford’s statement was not empty. It was dense with discovery. Aris felt as though he were standing on a familiar shore, only to watch the tide recede and reveal a landscape he had never known existed. He had always seen Stafford’s world as one of brute fact, of physics and function, a necessary but un-poetic reality. But to hear him describe it as a narrative, a process of reading a history layered into the very walls of a place, was to see the poetry in it. He looked at the man across the table, at his solid, capable hands resting near his plate, and saw him not just as a tradesman, but as a fellow interpreter of texts, albeit texts written in copper and plaster instead of ink and paper. The idea was so transformative that it reconfigured the entire landscape of their acquaintance.

"I never thought of it that way," Aris said, his voice quiet, stripped of any academic artifice. He was no longer a lecturer explaining a concept; he was a peer, sharing an idea. "That you have to understand the intent of the person who came before you. It's a kind of archeology. You're digging through the layers, finding the choices someone made twenty, fifty years ago." He pushed his empty soup bowl aside, his energy shifting from the weary convalescent to the engaged academic, his true native state. He stood up and ran a hand along the spine of a book in a nearby stack. "It’s the same with this. This is a copy of *The Odyssey*, but it was printed in 1890. The translator made certain choices, omitting lines he thought were too coarse for a Victorian audience, adding footnotes to explain the 'pagan' elements. He was the tradesman who came before me. To truly read the poem, I have to first read him. I have to understand his 'wiring'." He pulled the heavy, leather-bound volume from the stack and placed it on the table between them. He opened it to a page filled with dense type and even denser footnotes.

Stafford leaned forward, looking at the old, yellowed paper. He couldn't make sense of the words, but he understood the reverence with which Aris handled the object. It wasn't just a book; it was a device, a piece of old, complex machinery whose history was as important as its function. He listened as Aris talked, his voice regaining its familiar melodic rhythm, but this time it wasn't a performance for a class. It was a passionate, intricate explanation shared with a single, focused listener. He talked about the choices translators make, about the way a single word can change the entire current of a line of poetry. Stafford didn’t understand half of it, not the Greek terms or the literary debates, but he understood the core of it. He understood the obsession with getting it right, with honouring the original design while making it work for a new time. It was the same dilemma he faced when deciding whether to rip out a beautiful but dangerously outdated switchboard or to find a way to make it safe, to preserve the history while ensuring the lights stayed on. He just listened, offering a nod or a quiet "right," letting the river of Aris’s passion flow around him.

The afternoon sun slanted lower, turning the dust motes into a golden, swirling galaxy. The warmth of the day began to fade, and a cool shadow fell across the living room floor. The soup bowls were empty, the toast was gone. A natural endpoint had been reached. They carried the plates back to the kitchen, a comfortable silence having fallen once more. Stafford rinsed them under the now-perfectly silent tap and placed them in the dish rack, an act of domesticity that felt both profoundly strange and entirely right. Aris stood by, drying the saucepan with a tea towel, his earlier helplessness replaced by a quiet participation. The kitchen, once a symbol of his neglect, was now a shared space, a workshop where two different kinds of knowledge had met and found a common ground. Stafford knew he should leave. The lesson was over, lunch was finished. But he found himself reluctant to break the quiet accord they had established.

“Well,” he said, drying his hands on his jeans. “The tap should hold. No more drips.” The words sounded inadequate, a retreat into the safe, practical language he knew best. He had to get back to the familiar script.

“I have no doubt it will,” Aris replied. He folded the tea towel neatly and placed it on the counter. He didn’t want the script to end. He wanted to find a reason to keep the scene going. “The starter in the fluorescent light,” he began, gesturing upwards. “Perhaps that could be lesson number two? I’m free next Saturday.” The offer was bold, a clear and undisguised desire to repeat the experience, to make this a fixture. It was a risk, a departure from the safety of reciprocal obligation into the uncharted territory of simple, mutual desire for company.

A slow smile spread across Stafford’s face. It was a look of pure relief. He hadn't been sure how to ask, how to ensure the connection remained open without a specific fault to fix. Aris had just handed him the next diagram. “Yeah,” he said, his voice warm. “Next Saturday. I’ll bring a new starter. They’re easy.” He picked up his canvas pouch of tools from the counter. This time, the parting felt different. It wasn't an escape or a job completion. It was a pause. He walked to the front door, and Aris followed. He opened it, and the cool evening air washed in. He turned on the porch, looking back at Aris standing in the warm light of his hallway, surrounded by his paper-and-ink world. “See you in class, then,” Stafford said.

“I’ll look for you,” Aris replied, and the simple words were a promise. Stafford walked down the path, the sound of his boots solid on the paving stones. He didn't look back, but he could feel Aris’s gaze on him until he reached his ute. As he drove away, the setting sun catching the top of the stadium and turning it into a blazing crown, he felt a sense of profound contentment. He wasn't just fixing a house anymore. He was helping to rebuild it, one small, logical connection at a time. And back in the house, Aris stood for a long time in the hallway, listening to the sound of the ute’s engine fade into the distance. The house was quiet, but it was a different kind of quiet. It was no longer the silence of neglect and solitude. It was the calm, humming silence of a system in which the current was finally, steadily, beginning to flow.The following Tuesday, the fluorescent lights of the lecture hall seemed less harsh to Stafford. The beige box of a room, which he had once thought smelled of despair, now simply smelled of floor polish. The squeak of the plastic chairs was just a sound, not a symptom of a larger malaise. He took his usual seat at the back, but he didn't feel relegated to the fringes. He felt like he was exactly where he was supposed to be, occupying a space that was now, in some small way, his own. He watched the other students drift in, the same familiar constellation of faces, but he saw them differently now, as fellow travelers who had unknowingly witnessed the beginning of his own story. The anticipation he felt was a low, steady hum, a stark contrast to the anxious live wire of the previous week. He wasn't waiting to see *if* a connection would be made; he was waiting to see how it would be acknowledged.

Aris arrived five minutes late, as was his custom, a cascade of dark hair falling over his eyes. He looked vital, a man fully inhabiting his own skin. He dropped his satchel on the lectern, pushed his hair back with a sigh that sounded less like the weight of the world and more like a man gathering his thoughts, and his eyes immediately scanned the room. They swept past the librarian, past the art student, and settled on Stafford’s face at the back. It was a brief, deliberate act of seeing. A small, almost imperceptible nod passed between them, a silent confirmation of Saturday’s appointment, an acknowledgment that the conversation started over soup and a leaky tap was still ongoing. Then Aris turned his attention to the class as a whole, and the public performance began.

"Tonight," he started, his voice resonating with its familiar, captivating timbre, "we move from the Greeks to the Romans. Specifically, to their obsession with structure, with order imposed upon a chaotic world." He paced, but his energy was more focused, less caged than before. "The Greeks gave us the questions, the drama, the messy, beautiful chaos of the human heart. The Romans… the Romans gave us aqueducts." A few students chuckled. Stafford listened, leaning forward slightly. "Don't laugh," Aris chided gently. "An aqueduct is a magnificent piece of narrative. It is a story about overcoming obstacles—mountains, valleys, the sheer indifference of distance—through logic, persistence, and an unshakable belief in the principle of a steady, downward gradient." He spoke of the beauty of a perfectly executed arch, the genius of waterproof concrete, the sheer, bloody-minded will required to carry a river for fifty miles just so a city could have clean water.

He was talking about plumbing. On a grand, historical scale. He was taking Stafford's world of pipes and pressures and elevating it to the level of classical achievement. He was translating Stafford’s life into his own language, holding it up for the class to admire, though only two people in the room understood the true context of the lecture. Stafford felt a slow, rising heat of a different kind—not embarrassment, but a profound, startling feeling of being understood. Aris talked about the Roman architect Vitruvius and his three principles of good building: *firmitas*, *utilitas*, *venustas*. Strength, utility, and beauty. "The Romans understood," Aris said, his eyes finding Stafford's again across the room, "that a thing could not be truly beautiful if it did not work. Its beauty was inherent in its function, in its perfect and elegant solution to a problem." It was a direct response to Stafford’s own philosophy, spoken a week earlier in a noisy pub. It was an answer, a validation.

The week passed in a haze of contented work. On a job in Bell Park, replacing the ancient, cloth-wrapped wiring in a Californian bungalow much like Aris's, Stafford found himself working with a new kind of attention. He thought of what Aris had said about archeology. He looked at the strange, illogical junction points, the shortcuts taken, the moments of surprising craftsmanship, and tried to read the story of the long-dead sparky who had come before him. "What were you thinking here, mate?" he murmured to himself, tracing a wire that seemed to lead to nowhere. The house wasn’t just a problem to be solved; it was a text to be read, and he felt a quiet kinship with the ghost of his predecessor. The work felt richer, more meaningful. On Thursday, he went to the hardware store and bought a fluorescent light starter. He held the small, cylindrical object in his palm. It was a simple device, a bimetallic strip and a capacitor in a plastic case, but it felt like a key, a ticket to the next chapter.

Aris, meanwhile, found his own domestic landscape altered. The silence from the bathroom tap was a constant, pleasing reminder of Stafford's visit. It was the sound of competence. It was the sound of a problem solved. It made the other small failures of the house seem more pronounced, more solvable. He found himself looking at the teetering stacks of books not as comforting walls, but as obstacles. On Friday afternoon, spurred by a sudden, uncharacteristic burst of energy, he spent three hours moving them. He didn't get rid of any, but he consolidated, he organized, he cleared paths. He created a wide, open space in the middle of the living room. When he was done, sweating and covered in a fine layer of dust, the house felt like it could breathe for the first time in years. He stood in the middle of the room and felt a sense of ownership that was entirely new. It wasn't just a place he inhabited. It was a place he could, perhaps, begin to shape. The thought of Saturday, and of Stafford’s return, was not a source of anxiety, but a quiet, thrilling promise of further restoration.When Stafford knocked on the door at one o’clock on the second Saturday, the change was immediate and striking. Aris opened the door not with the air of a man surprised by a visitor, but with the quiet confidence of someone expecting a guest. More than that, the house behind him had changed. The oppressive weight of the book stacks had receded. Sunlight, no longer choked by clutter, reached deep into the hallway, illuminating a clear path through to the living room. The air felt lighter, as if the house itself had taken a deep, cleansing breath. Stafford stepped inside, his boots making a solid, welcome sound on the floorboards, and took in the new geography of the room.

"You've been busy," Stafford observed, his gaze sweeping over the newly created open space. It wasn't an accusation of untidiness before, but an acknowledgment of effort now.

"An exercise in Roman principles," Aris replied, a hint of pride in his voice. He closed the door behind Stafford, the click echoing in the less-cluttered space. "Imposing order on chaos. It turns out to be surprisingly satisfying. And a great deal more strenuous than I imagined." He looked around the room, seeing it through Stafford's eyes, and seemed pleased with the result. The house was still undeniably his, a fortress of literature, but now it had ramparts and clearings, spaces for a life to be lived beyond the page.

They moved to the kitchen, the purpose of the visit providing a comfortable, familiar structure. The room was clean, the single plate and mug from lunch already washed and put away. Stafford placed the small, cylindrical starter on the counter. It looked tiny and insignificant. "This should be easy," he said, tapping the plastic tube. "Most of the time, this is all it is." He pointed to the long fluorescent fitting above the sink. "You just give the old one a quarter turn to the left and it pops out. Put the new one in, quarter turn to the right. Done."

He dragged a kitchen chair over for Aris to stand on, a reversal of the previous week where he had been the one to crouch and peer into the workings of the house. Aris climbed onto the chair, a little unsteady, and Stafford instinctively put a hand on the chair-back to steady it. "Alright?" he asked, his voice low. From this angle, standing below, he could see the fine lines at the corner of Aris's eyes, the slight tension in his jaw as he concentrated on the task. Aris reached up, his long fingers finding the old starter. He twisted it as instructed, and it came loose in his hand. He looked down at Stafford, holding the small component like a relic. Stafford held up the new one, and Aris made the exchange, his movements careful and deliberate. He slotted the new starter in and twisted it home.

"Okay," Aris said, stepping down from the chair. "Now what?"

"Flick the switch," Stafford said, moving the chair back to the table. "Moment of truth." Aris reached for the switch on the wall and flipped it. The light flickered, buzzed, flashed once, twice, and then settled into the same inconsistent, maddening flutter as before. A faint, defeated sigh escaped Aris's lips. "So much for Roman logic," he murmured, staring up at the failing light.

Stafford, however, wasn't disappointed. A new expression had settled on his face, one of intense, focused curiosity. The simple fix hadn't worked, which meant the problem was more interesting. "It's not the starter," he said, his voice taking on a new energy. "It's a ghost in the machine." He looked at Aris, and there was a glint of a challenge in his eyes. "This is where you have to read the story." He went out to his ute, returning a moment later not with the small canvas pouch, but with his main toolbox, a heavy, steel cantilever case that he opened on the kitchen floor with a series of satisfying, metallic clicks. It revealed a neatly organized world of specialized tools, testers, and meters. Aris looked at the array of intricate devices with the same awe he usually reserved for a first edition.

For the next half-hour, Aris was a silent observer as Stafford became a different person. The quiet, practical man was replaced by an expert in his element, his movements precise and economical, his focus absolute. He cut the power at the main switchboard, then disassembled the light fitting, explaining each step in a low, running commentary, as much for himself as for Aris. "See this wiring? It's old. Imperial colours. Red, black, green. They haven't used this for thirty years." He pointed with the tip of a screwdriver. "And here, someone's been in here before. See the modern tape? They've done a dodgy repair. They've bypassed the original ballast instead of replacing it. That's why it's buzzing." He pulled out a multimeter, a black device with a dial and a digital screen, and touched the probes to different points in the circuit, watching the numbers on the screen. "Just tracing the path," he murmured. "Seeing where the current stops."

He was an archeologist, a detective, a storyteller, all at once. He was showing Aris the narrative of neglect and convenience written in the wires of his own home. Finally, he found it. A wire deep inside the fitting whose plastic insulation had become brittle with age and heat, cracking away to expose the copper beneath. It was intermittently touching the metal casing, causing a short, a flicker, a dangerous and inefficient leak of power. "There you are," Stafford said with quiet satisfaction. "There's the break in the story." He meticulously cut away the faulty section, stripped the wires afresh, and made a new, clean connection, wrapping it securely in modern, heat-resistant insulation. He reassembled the fitting, his movements deft and sure. He checked his work one last time, then went to restore the power. He walked back into the kitchen and nodded at Aris. "Try it now." Aris flipped the switch. The light came on instantly, a clean, silent, unwavering band of bright, white light. It flooded the kitchen, chasing away the shadows and illuminating the room with a brilliance it hadn't seen in years.

Aris stared at the light, then at Stafford, who was wiping a smudge of dust from his hands with a rag from his toolbox. The satisfaction in the room was profound. It was a victory over chaos, a perfect, elegant solution. "Firmitas, utilitas, venustas," Aris said softly. "Strength, utility, beauty. I understand now. It's beautiful." Stafford looked up at the light, then at Aris's face, illuminated and full of genuine wonder, and felt a deep, resonant hum of pride that was entirely new to him. It wasn't just the satisfaction of a job well done. It was the satisfaction of being truly seen.The beautiful, unwavering light held them both captive for a long moment. It was more than just illumination; it was a testament, a physical manifestation of a successful collaboration. Aris looked from the flawless light to Stafford, who was quietly beginning to pack his tools away, the metallic clicks and snaps of the toolbox a kind of punctuation mark to the completed task. The familiar, sinking feeling of an ending, of a departure, began to prick at Aris. The pretext was gone. The lesson was over. He couldn't let the silence be filled by the sound of Stafford leaving.

"Don't pack up yet," Aris said, the words coming out with a quiet urgency. Stafford paused, his hand hovering over a set of pliers. He looked at Aris, a question in his eyes. "The light is fixed," Aris continued, gesturing around the newly ordered living room. "But the house… it's still just a place for storing things. You said yourself, if you can't fix it, you don't really own it. I think… I think I need a lesson in how to own it. How to use it." The request was clumsy, an abstract problem presented to the most practical of men, but it was all he had. He was asking Stafford not to fix another object, but to help him fix the atmosphere, to help him animate the space he had cleared.

Stafford looked from Aris's earnest, slightly desperate face to the open space in the living room, to the sofa and the single armchair. He slowly closed the lid on one of the toolbox compartments. He seemed to understand the unstated plea beneath the awkward words. He wasn't being asked for a skill; he was being asked for his time, for his presence. "What did you have in mind?" he asked, his voice low and steady, accepting the new, undefined terms of the job.

"You brought your world into my house," Aris said, a new confidence blooming in his chest as the idea took shape. "You showed me its narrative, its logic. Allow me to do the same for you." He walked over to the stack of books where the old copy of *The Odyssey* rested on top. He picked it up, the worn leather feeling solid and familiar in his hands. "I can't teach you how to read ancient Greek in an afternoon, but I can show you what it sounds like. What it *feels* like." He held the book out, an offering. "Let me read to you. Not a lecture. Just a story."

The offer was so far outside of Stafford’s experience it was almost baffling. No one had read to him since he was a small child struggling with picture books. He, a grown man, a tradesman, being offered a story time? He should have felt awkward, embarrassed. But looking at the passion in Aris’s eyes, the sincere desire to share the one tool he truly knew how to wield, Stafford felt only a deep, compelling curiosity. He wanted to hear it. He wanted to know what Aris’s world sounded like. He gave a single, slow nod. "Alright."

A look of profound relief and quiet joy washed over Aris’s face. He gestured for Stafford to take the armchair, the one he himself had occupied during his fever. Stafford sat, the chair still seeming to hold a faint memory of his own care. Aris didn't take the sofa. Instead, he pulled a small, hard-backed dining chair into the open space and sat, placing the book in his lap. He found a pair of reading glasses on a nearby shelf and put them on, a small act that made him look both older and more vulnerable. He took a deep, preparatory breath, and the room seemed to fall silent, waiting. "This is from Book Six," he began, his voice soft. "Odysseus has washed ashore after losing everything. He is naked, beaten, and alone. He is at his lowest point, a man stripped of all his titles and possessions. And he is discovered by the princess, Nausicaa."

Then, he began to read. He didn't read the English translation, but the original Greek. The words were a river of sound, a cascade of unfamiliar vowels and consonants that held a strange, percussive music. Stafford didn’t understand a single word, but he understood everything. He heard the desperation in the long, flowing lines of Odysseus’s plea, the gentle surprise and regal calm in the shorter, more measured responses of the princess. Aris’s voice was no longer a lecturer's tool; it was an instrument. It rose and fell with the cadence of the poetry, painting a landscape of sound in the quiet, sunlit room. Stafford closed his eyes. He saw not a Greek shore, but the wind-whipped expanse of Corio Bay. He felt not the Mediterranean sun, but the cold, insistent push of the winter wind. He understood the feeling of being stripped down, of being at the mercy of forces beyond your control. And he heard in the melodic rise and fall of Aris's voice the same thing he felt when a complex problem finally resolved itself into a simple, elegant solution: a sense of order emerging from chaos, a promise of light after darkness.

When Aris stopped, the silence that descended was deep and resonant. It was filled with the ghost-music of the ancient words. Stafford opened his eyes. Aris had taken off his glasses and was looking at him, his expression open and expectant. "So," Aris said quietly. "That's what it sounds like."

"It's good," Stafford said, the simple words feeling wholly inadequate, yet somehow enough. "It’s… sad, but it sounds like things are about to get better for him." He had understood the story perfectly, not through its language, but through its emotional current. A slow, breathtaking smile spread across Aris’s face. It was the most unguarded, genuine expression Stafford had ever seen from him.

"Yes," Aris said, his voice soft with wonder. "That is precisely it. Things are about to get better." He closed the book and placed it reverently on the floor beside him. They sat in the comfortable silence, the shared experience of the story a new, invisible connection between them. The sun had shifted again, and the light in the room was turning golden. The need for pretense, for lessons and repairs, had been burned away by the poetry, leaving something cleaner and simpler in its place. "Stafford," Aris began, his voice hesitant as he navigated this new, uncharted territory. "My parents, the librarians. They worked opposite shifts. We never had a meal together as a family, not really. The house was always quiet. Just… books, and waiting." The admission was stark, a glimpse into the architecture of his own solitude.

The confession unlocked something in Stafford. "My old man was always on call," he said, his gaze distant as he remembered. "We'd be halfway through dinner and the phone would ring. A blackout at the refinery, a fault at the hospital. He'd be gone. My mum and I would just finish eating. It was normal." They were two men from different worlds, who had grown up in two different kinds of quiet, lonely houses. The recognition of this shared, foundational silence passed between them without another word. The afternoon had slipped away, and the day was ending. Stafford knew he had to go. The week, with its demands of work and normality, was waiting. He stood up, and the spell was broken.

"I should get going," he said, and this time, the words felt like a genuine regret. Aris stood as well, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes. He had no more broken appliances to offer, no more lectures to give. The reasons for Stafford to stay had been exhausted. But the desire for him to remain had not. "Next Saturday," Aris said, the words a leap of faith. "There are no more lessons. But I would like to cook for you. A proper meal. To thank you. To… continue the conversation." It was a simple invitation, stripped of all subtext and obligation. It was just a man, asking another man to dinner.

Stafford looked at Aris, standing there in the middle of his newly ordered living room, the golden light catching the dust on his worn jumper. He saw not a lecturer or a helpless academic, but a man who was, just like him, trying to figure out how the wiring worked. "I'd like that," Stafford said, and his own smile was as open and unguarded as Aris's had been. "I'll be here."The week leading up to Saturday was a foreign country for Stafford. The anticipation was a low, constant hum beneath the surface of his days, a different kind of current from any he had ever worked with. It had no source and no ground; it simply existed, a quiet energy that coloured everything. He was not waiting for a job to be finished or a problem to be solved. He was waiting for a meal. The simplicity of it felt monumental. On Friday afternoon, after finishing a job, he found himself parked outside a bottle shop in Geelong West, the engine of his ute idling. He felt a profound sense of being out of his depth. He was a man whose expertise ended with the choice between a cold pot of Carlton or a colder stubby of VB. He went inside, the walls of wine bottles arranged by country and grape varietal looking as complex and intimidating as Aris’s library. He eventually settled on a bottle of red wine, a shiraz from a winery near Bannockburn, choosing it for the simple, logical reason that it was local. It felt like a solid, defensible choice. He placed the bottle on the passenger seat of his ute, where it sat like a quiet, respectable passenger for the entire drive home.

That Tuesday, the lecture hall felt like a halfway point, a familiar landmark on a journey into new territory. The topic was hospitality in *The Odyssey*, a direct continuation of the previous week’s theme. Aris contrasted the monstrous, cannibalistic parody of a feast in the Cyclops's cave with the civilized, restorative banquet offered by the Phaeacians. He spoke of how sharing a meal was the ultimate act of turning a stranger into a guest, of acknowledging a shared humanity. "To break bread with someone," he said, his eyes scanning the room, "is to declare a truce with the chaos of the world, to create a small, temporary sanctuary of warmth and order." His gaze found Stafford's for a fraction of a second, and the look that passed between them was a silent, mutual acknowledgment. *We have a truce. We are building a sanctuary.* The rest of the lecture faded into a pleasant, melodic hum for Stafford. He had the information he needed. The circuit was still live.

For Aris, the week was a campaign waged on a single, terrifying front: his kitchen. He approached the task of cooking a meal with the same rigorous methodology he would apply to a difficult passage of text. He did not simply decide on a recipe; he researched. He spent an entire evening in his newly ordered living room surrounded not by poetry, but by three cookbooks he had purchased that afternoon, cross-referencing techniques for roasting a chicken and arguing with himself over the merits of different potato varietals. He made lists. A master list of ingredients, a separate list of necessary equipment he did not own, and a third, intricately timed list of actions for Saturday afternoon. On Friday, he ventured into the Geelong Market, a place he had only ever passed by. He was a tall, tweed-clad ghost navigating a vibrant, chaotic world of shouting vendors, glistening fish on ice, and pyramids of bright, fragrant vegetables. He clutched his list like a holy writ, his expression one of intense, terrified concentration, and returned to his quiet house with bags full of raw, terrifying potential.

Saturday was a battle. He put on an apron he found in the back of a drawer, a stiff, floral-patterned thing that was probably a relic from a previous tenant, and it felt as foreign and ridiculous as a suit of armour. He followed his lists with a ferocious devotion. Flour dusted his jumper, a slick of olive oil stained a page of his cookbook, and at one point, a pan of sizzling garlic and onions threatened to erupt into a full-blown grease fire, a crisis he averted with a panicked throw of a pot lid that clattered to the floor with the sound of a dropped shield. The kitchen, usually a place of quiet neglect, was filled with the sounds and smells of creation: the rhythmic thump of a knife on a chopping board, the hiss of the oven, the rich, developing aroma of garlic and rosemary and roasting chicken. He was sweating, his hair was a mess, and he had a small burn on his forearm, but as the afternoon wore on, a sense of order began to emerge from the chaos. He was imposing his will on these raw ingredients, and they were, slowly, miraculously, cohering into a meal. When the timer buzzed, he pulled the chicken from the oven. It was golden brown, fragrant, and undeniably cooked. He had not failed.

The knock on the door at seven o’clock precisely was a jolt that ran through his entire, exhausted body. He took off the apron, smoothed his hair down with trembling hands, and walked to the door. When he opened it, Stafford was standing there, a solid, calming presence on his doorstep. He was holding a bottle of red wine. "I wasn't sure what to bring," Stafford said, holding it out. The gesture was tentative, an offering made across a cultural divide. Aris took the bottle, his fingers brushing Stafford's. The glass was cool, the label elegant. "It's perfect," Aris said, and the relief in his voice was absolute. He stepped back, ushering Stafford into a house that smelled not of old paper and dust, but of home.

They sat at the small round table, now covered with a clean linen cloth Aris had found, still in its original packaging. There were two proper wine glasses, and two sets of cutlery laid out with painstaking, if not quite correct, precision. The roasted chicken sat in the centre of the table, a magnificent, golden trophy. Stafford looked at the scene, at the effort and care that was so clearly evident in every detail, and felt a wave of something warm and profound wash over him. It was a feeling of being valued, of being welcomed not just as a guest, but as an integral part of the narrative Aris was trying to write. "This is..." Stafford started, searching for a word, "...amazing, Aris." Aris, who had been watching him with a nervous intensity, finally relaxed, a slow smile spreading across his face. "It was either this or the Cyclops's version," he said lightly. "I felt this was more in the spirit of the occasion." The meal was a revelation. The chicken was tender, the potatoes were crisp, and the conversation flowed as easily as the wine. They talked not of plumbing or poetry, but of their lives. Stafford talked about growing up in Norlane, the freedom of long summer holidays spent fishing off the pier, the simple, uncomplicated bonds of his friendships. Aris, in turn, spoke of his quiet, book-filled childhood in Melbourne, of lonely holidays spent in libraries while his parents worked, of feeling more at home in the worlds of books than in the real one. They were tracing the diagrams of their own lives for each other, finding the breaks and connections, reading the stories written into their pasts. The house was filled with the sound of their voices and the quiet clink of forks on plates, the sounds of a home being actively, purposefully inhabited. The sanctuary was built.The remnants of the meal sat between them, a landscape of shared history. The carcass of the chicken, the last of the roasted potatoes, the two empty wine glasses still holding the faint, purple scent of the shiraz. A pleasant, languid silence had settled over the table, the kind that follows a good meal and easy conversation. The house was warm, filled with the lingering aroma of rosemary and the quiet hum of the refrigerator, a sound Stafford now associated with a profound sense of peace. He felt bonelessly relaxed, a comfortable weariness that came not from physical labour but from the simple, satisfying work of being present, of sharing a space and a story with another person. The sanctuary was complete, its walls built of food and wine and newfound understanding, and for a while, it had held the rest of the world at bay.

But the world, with its schedules and its separate houses, always pushed back. Stafford glanced at his watch. It was late, well past the time any normal guest would have taken their leave. The script of a conventional evening dictated that he should thank his host and depart, retreating back to his own quiet unit, leaving Aris to his. The thought of it felt like a wrong connection, a wire put back in the wrong place, undoing all the careful work of the evening. He saw the same thought reflected in Aris’s eyes. As the silence stretched, a flicker of the old, familiar anxiety returned to Aris’s expression, the look of a man watching a tide go out, dreading the emptiness it would leave behind. The beautiful, living quiet of their conversation was threatening to curdle back into the cold, desolate silence of solitude.

“I should, uh… make a move,” Stafford said, the words feeling false and heavy in his mouth. He began to gather his things, the small, habitual movements of a man preparing for departure.

“No,” Aris said, the word too quick, too sharp. He visibly reined himself in, his hands clasping together on the table in front of him as if to physically restrain his own desperation. He took a breath, searching for a reason, for a new line in the script. “Coffee,” he said, seizing on the idea. “I have coffee. Not instant. The real kind. With the… the grinder thing. You can’t possibly leave without coffee.” It was a small, transparent piece of stage direction, a desperate ad-lib to keep the scene from ending, but it was offered with such raw sincerity that to refuse it would have been an act of cruelty.

Stafford paused, his hand halfway to his jacket. He looked at Aris, at the undisguised plea in his eyes, and the last of his own programmed urge to leave dissolved completely. “Yeah,” he said, his voice soft. “Coffee sounds good.” The relief that washed over Aris’s face was so profound it was almost painful to watch. He stood up, his movements suddenly energized, and began clearing the table with a newfound purpose. “Don’t worry about that,” Stafford said, standing as well. “I’ll give you a hand.” They worked together in the small kitchen, rinsing plates and stacking them by the sink, the easy, unspoken rhythm they’d found earlier returning instantly. Aris located the antique coffee grinder and a bag of dark, oily beans, and soon the kitchen was filled with a new aroma, rich and earthy, overlaying the scent of the finished dinner.

With two mugs of strong, black coffee in their hands, they migrated from the kitchen. Stafford, without thinking, bypassed the formal dining table and walked into the newly cleared space in the living room, sinking into the deep, sagging comfort of the sofa. Aris, after a moment’s hesitation, took the threadbare armchair opposite him. It was a subtle but significant shift. They were no longer host and guest seated at a formal meal. They were two men in a living room, sharing a late-night coffee, the day’s obligations met, the night’s possibilities stretching out before them. The soft glow from a single floor lamp, one of the few Aris owned that worked reliably, pooled around them, leaving the rest of the room and its book-lined walls in gentle shadow.

"This room," Aris said, looking around as if he were a visitor in his own home. "It has never been used for this. For sitting. For… this." He gestured vaguely with his mug, encompassing the coffee, the comfortable silence, the presence of another person. "Its function was purely archival. I feel like an archeologist who has discovered a hidden chamber in his own tomb and found it suitable for habitation." He looked at Stafford, his expression a complex mixture of gratitude and wry self-mockery. "Thank you for the light fitting, Stafford. It seems to have illuminated more than just the kitchen."

"A house needs to be lived in," Stafford replied, his own words simpler, more direct. He took a sip of the coffee. It was strong and slightly bitter, and it tasted like a victory. "Otherwise things just seize up. The pipes corrode, the wiring decays. It's not the use that wears a place out. It's the opposite. It's the not-using." He looked around the room, at the cleared space and the man sitting in it. "It just needed a current running through it." The metaphor was his, from his own world, but he knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his gut, that Aris would understand it perfectly. It was the language they now shared.

They drank their coffee, the silence returning, but this time it was a different entity altogether. It was not a void, but a presence. It was the comfortable, breathing quiet of two people who no longer needed to fill the space between them with words. The wine, the food, and the late hour had settled into a pleasant, heavy warmth in Stafford's limbs. Aris, too, seemed to have reached a point of peaceful exhaustion. The nervous energy had completely dissipated, leaving behind a man who looked younger, softer, and more at ease than Stafford had ever seen him. He leaned his head back against the worn fabric of the armchair and his eyes drifted closed. Stafford watched the slow, even rise and fall of his chest. The coffee mugs were empty. The last excuse for him to stay had been used up. But the thought of standing up, of breaking the spell and walking out into the cold night, was impossible. It would be an act of vandalism, like taking a sledgehammer to a perfectly restored circuit board.

He looked at Aris, peaceful and unguarded in sleep or near-sleep, a man who had spent a lifetime building walls of words and solitude. He had, with tremendous effort and courage, opened a door. To walk out of it now would be to slam it shut behind him. Stafford made a decision. It wasn’t a grand, considered conclusion, but a simple, physical response to the situation, as instinctive as reaching out to steady a falling ladder. He didn't say a word. He just leaned back, settling his own head against the dusty velvet of the sofa, stretching his legs out in front of him. He placed his empty mug on the floor with a soft thud. It was a quiet declaration. An anchor dropped in a safe harbour. Aris’s eyes fluttered open at the sound, a flicker of drowsy alarm in them. He saw Stafford, not gathering his coat, but settling in, his solid frame a permanent fixture in the landscape of the room. A slow, questioning look passed over Aris’s face, a silent query. Stafford simply met his gaze, his expression calm and unreadable, and gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. A wave of understanding, so profound it was almost like relief, washed over Aris. He closed his eyes again, but this time, a faint, deep smile touched his lips. He was not alone. The sanctuary would hold through the night.Stafford woke with the ingrained, internal alarm of a man who had spent two decades rising before the sun. The first thing he registered was the quality of the light. It was a thin, pearlescent grey, the tentative light of a Sunday morning filtering through the dusty front window. The second thing he registered was a deep, cramping ache in his neck from sleeping folded into the hostile geography of the sofa. He didn't move for a long moment, letting his senses take stock. The house was utterly still, held in the quiet suspension of early dawn. The air was cool, but not the biting, invasive cold of before. It was just the neutral coolness of a house at rest. Across the room, Aris was a long, still shape in the armchair, the grey woollen blanket Stafford had first brought him pulled up to his chest, his head turned to one side, his dark hair a smudge against the pale, worn fabric. He was deeply asleep, his face serene and unguarded, the anxious, intellectual energy of his waking hours completely erased.

Slowly, carefully, Stafford unwound himself from the sofa, his joints protesting with a series of muted clicks and groans. He stood, rolling his shoulders, a monolith of silent movement in the grey light. He looked at the sleeping man, at the scattered evidence of the previous night—the empty wine glasses on the table, the book of Greek poetry on the floor, his own empty coffee mug beside the sofa. It all looked like the aftermath of a small, successful siege, a battle won against solitude. A feeling of profound rightness settled over him, as solid and certain as a newly laid foundation. He was not an intruder here in the morning light. He was part of the scene. The protective ache he had felt for Aris had undergone a quiet transformation, its frantic, urgent current mellowing into a low, steady warmth that seemed to have rewired his entire being. This was not a problem to be fixed. This was a place to be.

Acting on an instinct as natural as breathing, he moved quietly towards the kitchen. The new light fitting he had installed flooded the room with clean, even light at the flick of a switch, a small beacon of order in the sleeping house. He found the coffee beans and the antique grinder, and the quiet, rhythmic crunch as he turned the handle was the first sound to break the morning's silence. The rich, dark aroma filled the kitchen, a smell of purpose and beginnings. He located the saucepan they had used for the soup, rinsed it, and filled it with water to boil on the stove, not wanting to risk waking Aris with the whistle of a kettle. He measured the coffee grounds into a French press he discovered in the back of a cupboard, another piece of abandoned equipment now being called into service. He moved through the unfamiliar kitchen with a quiet, proprietary confidence, his hands knowing what to do, his presence a simple, functional fact. He was making coffee. It was the most ordinary act in the world, and it felt like the most significant thing he had ever done.

The rich scent of brewing coffee drifted into the living room, a gentle summons. Aris stirred, a low murmur escaping his lips. He shifted in the armchair, his brow furrowing as he surfaced slowly from a deep, dreamless sleep. His first conscious thought was that the house smelled different. It smelled alive. He opened his eyes, blinking against the encroaching daylight, his mind struggling to place the warm, dark aroma that was so alien to his morning routine of stale air and black tea. He pushed himself up, the blanket pooling in his lap, and saw him. Stafford. He was standing in the kitchen doorway, holding two steaming mugs, his broad frame a dark, solid silhouette against the bright light behind him. He wasn't a dream. He was real. He had stayed. A jolt, not of alarm, but of pure, unadulterated shock, ran through Aris. The sanctuary had held. The morning had come, and he was not alone.

Stafford walked into the room and handed one of the mugs to Aris. Their fingers brushed as Aris took it, the warmth of the ceramic seeping into his cold hands. "Morning," Stafford said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble in the quiet room. "Figured you might need this." Aris stared into the black, steaming coffee, then up at Stafford's calm, steady face. The night's intimacy, which he had half-feared would evaporate into awkwardness in the sober light of day, was still there, settled into a new, quieter shape. The sheer, uncomplicated fact of Stafford's presence, of this offering of coffee, was so overwhelming that he could not find the words to respond. He simply nodded, his throat tight, and took a sip. The coffee was strong, hot, and perfect. It was the taste of a new reality.

"I can make some breakfast," Stafford said, taking a seat on the edge of the sofa, claiming his space as if he had been doing so every morning for years. "There's eggs. And that bread." It wasn't a question so much as a plan, a simple, logical progression from coffee to food. He was grounding the miraculous, unbelievable fact of the morning in the solid, ordinary bedrock of routine. Aris found his voice, though it was raspy with sleep. "I don't think I've had eggs for breakfast since I left my parents' house." The admission was a small, vulnerable truth offered into the quiet space between them. Stafford just nodded, accepting it without comment. "Then it's about time," he said. He finished his coffee in a few efficient swallows, stood up, and headed back to the kitchen. Aris sat for a moment longer, holding the warm mug in both hands, listening to the sounds filtering from the other room: the solid clink of a plate, the opening of the refrigerator, the unmistakable, homely sizzle of something hitting a hot pan. He was a guest in his own home, a stranger in his own morning, and he had never felt more at peace. He stood up, leaving the blanket behind in the armchair like a shed skin, and followed the sounds and smells, drawn towards the light.Aris stood in the doorway of his own kitchen, a silent spectator to a miracle. The room, bathed in the clean, unwavering light that was Stafford’s first gift, was a hub of quiet, purposeful activity. Stafford stood at the stove, his back to Aris, a solid, reassuring presence in a space that had only ever known solitude and neglect. He held a spatula in one hand, his movements economical and sure as he nudged eggs around a sizzling pan. The homely scent of frying bacon, a smell Aris couldn't remember ever smelling in this house, mingled with the dark, rich aroma of the coffee. It was a symphony of the mundane, and to Aris, it sounded like the most beautiful music in the world. He felt a sense of profound dislocation, as if he had woken up in a different life, one where mornings were not empty, silent affairs, but filled with warmth and the promise of food. He leaned against the doorframe, clutching his warm mug, and simply watched, imprinting the impossible, ordinary scene onto his memory.

Stafford glanced over his shoulder, seeming to sense Aris’s presence. He wasn't startled; he just looked at him, a flicker of a smile on his face. "Toast is in the toaster. Can you grab the plates? Top cupboard, left of the sink." The instruction was casual, easy, the kind one gives to a partner, a roommate, a family member. It was an assumption of intimacy, of shared space, and it landed in Aris’s chest with a soft, concussive force. He was being asked to participate, to be a functional part of this new domestic reality. He nodded, a little dumbly, and moved to the cupboard. He found the plates, plain white ceramic ones he’d bought years ago and rarely used, and set them on the small kitchen table. He felt clumsy, an apprentice fumbling with unfamiliar tools, but there was a deep satisfaction in the simple act. He was no longer just the grateful, helpless recipient. He was helping to set the table for his own breakfast.

They ate in a comfortable, sun-drenched silence. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the bacon was crisp, and the rye toast, which had seemed so unappealingly stale a week ago, was transformed by the simple application of heat and butter. For the first time, the small table in the corner of his living room felt like a proper dining table, its purpose fulfilled. Aris ate slowly, savouring not just the food, but the entire experience: the sunlight slanting through the window, the reassuringly solid presence of the man across from him, the quiet clink of a fork against a plate. It was a texture of life he had only ever read about, and he found it to be grounding in a way that no book had ever been. It was Stafford who finally broke the silence, his voice low and relaxed. "So what does a professor do on a Sunday?"

The question was so normal, so simple, it took Aris by surprise. He had to think for a moment, to reconstruct the shape of his solitary routine. "I… read," he said, the answer sounding paltry and thin even to his own ears. "The Sunday papers from London and New York, online. I prepare for the week's lectures. I mark student essays. The day tends to… evaporate." He looked at the stacks of books that still lined the walls, a lifetime of evaporated Sundays. "What about you? What does a man who fixes things do on his day of rest?" The question was gentle, laced with a genuine curiosity.

"Not much," Stafford said with a shrug. "Sleep in a bit. Go for a run along the waterfront. Tinker with the ute if something's rattling. Sometimes I'll drive down to my mum's place in Grovedale for a roast. Watch the footy." He listed the components of his life as if they were items on a shopping list, a collection of simple, solid, tangible activities. His world was one of movement, of physical connection to his car, his city, his family. Aris's world was one of stillness, of intellectual connection to things that were abstract and far away. They were two completely different schematics for a life, and yet, here they were, sharing a table, the gap between their worlds momentarily bridged by eggs and coffee.

After breakfast, the spell of the morning began to wear thin, and the question of what came next hovered unspoken in the air. The reason for Stafford’s presence—the dinner, the overnight stay—was officially over. They cleared the plates, moving with the same easy synchronicity in the small kitchen, and then there was nothing left to do. Stafford leaned against the counter, drying his hands on a tea towel, and Aris felt a familiar, cold dread begin to creep in. The story was over. The hero was about to depart. "Well," Stafford said, his gaze not quite meeting Aris's. "I should probably head off. Let you get to your papers." It was the line the script demanded, the polite, expected retreat. Each word felt like a stone dropping into the quiet pool of the morning.

Aris looked around his living room, at the newly ordered space, at the sunlight falling on the floorboards where they had sat and talked, and he could not bear the thought of it becoming empty and silent again. He could not go back to the way things were. He had to change the ending. He straightened up, meeting Stafford’s gaze directly, his own voice steady and clear. "And if I don't want to get to my papers?" he asked. It was not a plea. It was a statement, a challenge to the script. "What if I've had enough of evaporated Sundays? What else is there?" He was asking Stafford to show him, to lead him out of the tomb, no matter how well-lit and comfortable it had become.

Stafford looked at him for a long, quiet moment, a slow reassessment taking place in his steady eyes. He saw not a man in need of rescue, but a man asking for a partnership. He saw an invitation. A smile, slow and genuine, spread across his face. "Well," he said, the single word now carrying a universe of possibility. "It's a nice day. I was thinking of taking a drive down the coast. The Great Ocean Road. Just to blow the dust off. Get some sea air." He paused, his offer hanging in the air, simple and profound. "Want to come?" Aris felt a feeling so buoyant it was almost like laughter rising in his chest. A drive. Not a rescue. Not a repair. Just a shared journey with no particular destination. It was the most beautiful piece of narrative he had ever been offered. "Yes," he said, without a moment's hesitation. "I would like that very much." The decision settled in the room, a solid, satisfying click. "Good," Stafford said, his smile widening. "I'll go home, have a shower, put some fuel in the ute. I'll be back in an hour." He walked to the door, and this time, there was no weight to his departure. It was not an ending. It was simply an interval, a brief pause before the next act. Aris stood in the doorway and watched him go, the morning sun on his face, feeling the unshakable certainty that for the first time in his life, his Sunday was not about to evaporate. It was just beginning.An hour can be an eternity or an instant. For Aris, the sixty minutes he had to himself were a period of strange, suspended time. He stood in his bedroom, facing his wardrobe, and found himself completely at a loss. The problem of what to wear for a "drive down the coast" was a sartorial challenge for which his entire life had left him unprepared. His wardrobe was a uniform, a carefully curated collection of tweed jackets, soft woollen jumpers, and dark, serviceable trousers designed for the hushed, climate-controlled environments of libraries and lecture halls. Nothing in his possession seemed appropriate for a trip in a tradesman’s ute to a place known for its wind and salt spray. He felt like a stage actor who had wandered into the wrong play, his costume hopelessly out of sync with the setting. After a brief, panicked consideration of his options, he made a decision based on a principle of compromise. He chose his oldest, most comfortable pair of dark corduroy trousers and a thick, navy blue Guernsey jumper, a garment whose nautical origins felt at least vaguely appropriate. He bypassed his tweed jackets entirely, selecting instead a simple, dark grey wool overcoat he hadn't worn in years. As he looked at his reflection in the dusty wardrobe mirror, he saw a man who was still recognisably himself, but slightly altered, adapted for a different context. He looked less like a professor and more like a poet on a melancholy seaside holiday. It would have to do.

He spent the remaining time pacing the newly cleared space in his living room, a restless, kinetic energy humming through him. He was a man accustomed to stillness, to a life lived within the four walls of his own mind, and the prospect of pure, unstructured movement through the world was both thrilling and terrifying. He was stepping out of the text and into the landscape. When the low, familiar rumble of Stafford’s ute finally sounded on the street outside, it was a profound relief, the arrival of a steady, guiding force. He grabbed his coat, locked the front door behind him with a decisive click, and walked down the path into the bright, breezy day, feeling as though he were embarking on the first real journey of his life. The cab of the ute was a revelation. It was immaculately clean, but it was a functional cleanliness, not a decorative one. The air smelled of clean rubber from the floor mats, a faint, lingering trace of sawdust, and the sharp, ozonic scent of Stafford himself. It was the smell of competence. Aris slid into the passenger seat, the space feeling both vast compared to his own small car and intimately close to the man beside him. Stafford, showered and changed into a fresh t-shirt that stretched across his broad shoulders, simply smiled at him, a warm, easy expression that instantly dissipated Aris's remaining nervousness. He turned the key, the engine rumbled to life, and with a smooth, practiced motion, he pulled away from the curb. The adventure had begun.

They drove south out of the city, leaving the quiet, leafy streets of Newtown behind for the sprawling, functional suburbs and then the open plains that stretched towards the coast. The conversation was easy, a low-key commentary on the passing landscape. Stafford pointed out landmarks from his own life—the turn-off to his mother's house, the industrial park where he'd done his apprenticeship, the distant, shimmering line of the You Yangs on the horizon. He was narrating the text of his own world, and Aris listened, absorbing the details, building a picture of the life that had produced this quiet, capable man. As they crested a hill just past Torquay, the world opened up. The scattered houses and farmland fell away, and there it was. The ocean. It was not the calm, contained grey of Corio Bay, but a vast, churning expanse of deep, royal blue, flecked with white and stretching to a sharp, clean horizon. The sheer scale of it was a physical blow, a magnificent, breathtaking shock to the system. Aris let out an involuntary breath, his hands instinctively gripping the dashboard. He had seen the ocean before, of course, but he had never *seen* it like this, from this vantage point, with his senses so keenly attuned to the newness of the world.

Stafford glanced at him, a knowing smile playing on his lips. "It gets you, the first time you see it like that," he said, his voice a low rumble beneath the sound of the engine. He didn't say anything more, letting the spectacle speak for itself. He turned the ute onto the Great Ocean Road proper, and the journey changed. The road narrowed, hugging the cliffside, a black ribbon of tarmac winding between the rugged, ochre-coloured earth on one side and the dizzying, sheer drop to the sea on the other. It was an audacious piece of engineering, a testament to the Roman principles Aris had lectured on: a story of imposing order on a chaotic, untameable landscape. Each turn revealed a new vista, a more dramatic composition of rock and sea and sky. Aris was silent, his face turned to the window, his expression one of rapt, absolute wonder. He was a scholar presented with a manuscript more ancient and profound than any in his library, its language written in wind and water and time. Stafford drove with an easy, unhurried confidence, his hands steady on the wheel, perfectly at home in this landscape of grand, elemental forces. He handled the powerful ute with a delicate precision, navigating the sharp bends and narrow stretches as if the vehicle were an extension of his own body. He was the ferryman, Charon, but instead of guiding a soul across a river of death, he was guiding one back into the vibrant, beautiful world of the living.

After a while, Stafford slowed the ute and pulled into a small, unmarked gravel turnout, perched precariously on the edge of a high cliff. He switched off the engine, and the sudden silence was immediately filled by a new sound: the deep, resonant roar of the ocean below, and the high, whistling cry of the wind buffeting the car. "Best view on this stretch," Stafford said, by way of explanation. "And no tourists." They got out, and the wind hit them with a physical force, a clean, cold blast that smelled of salt and distance. It tore at their clothes and whipped Aris’s hair across his face. He had to brace himself against the side of the ute, his coat flapping around him. Stafford, solid and unmovable as a pylon, just stood and breathed it in, a man at home in the elements. They walked to the edge of the lookout, a simple wooden railing the only thing separating them from the hundred-foot drop to the churning, foam-laced water below. The view was immense, terrifying, and sublime. The waves, driven by some unstoppable momentum from the deep south, crashed against the base of the cliffs with a percussive, rhythmic violence that Aris could feel in the soles of his shoes.

They stood side-by-side for a long time, not speaking, two small, human figures dwarfed by the sheer scale of the natural world. Aris felt the carefully constructed intellectual architecture of his life begin to crumble, rendered insignificant by the raw, ancient power in front of him. His anxieties, his lectures, his books—they were all dust motes in the face of this. All that felt real was the solid ground beneath his feet, the wind on his face, and the quiet, steady presence of the man standing next to him. "It's a story about decay," Aris said at last, his voice raised to be heard over the wind and waves. He pointed a gloved finger at the cliff face, at the jagged lines and fissures, at the places where huge chunks of rock had clearly broken away and fallen into the sea. "A slow, relentless erosion. The land is losing a battle it was always destined to lose." Stafford looked where he was pointing, his gaze practical, assessing. "That's why they're always working on the road," he said. "Landslides. They put in steel nets and retaining walls, but it's a losing game. The sea always wins in the end. It's just a matter of time." He wasn't being poetic; he was stating a fact of engineering, a problem with no permanent solution. It was the same conclusion Aris had reached, arrived at from a completely different path. They were reading the same text, and for the first time, they were speaking the same language. Aris looked at Stafford, at his strong, wind-whipped profile outlined against the vast blue sky, and felt a connection to him that was as powerful and undeniable as the ocean itself. It was a current that flowed not through wires or words, but through a shared and silent understanding of the beautiful, terrifying, and transient nature of the world.The wind, relentless and searching, eventually found its way through the layers of Aris’s unaccustomed clothing, seeping into his bones with a deep, invasive chill. He shivered, a small, involuntary tremor, and pulled the collar of his wool coat tighter around his neck. It was a futile gesture against such a powerful, indifferent force. Stafford noticed the movement. He didn’t say anything, but his gaze lingered for a moment on Aris’s face, which had lost some of its colour, then he turned and looked back out at the vast, churning sea. After another minute, as if he had come to a silent decision, he touched Aris’s arm lightly through the thick wool of his coat. The touch was brief, a simple signal. "Come on," he said, his voice carrying easily over the roar. "It's getting cold. There's more to see."

They walked back to the ute, leaning into the wind, their footsteps crunching on the gravel. Stafford held the passenger door open for Aris, shielding him from the worst of the blast with his own body, a simple, unconscious act of shelter that felt as natural as breathing. The moment the door slammed shut, the world was muted. The roar of the ocean and the shriek of the wind were reduced to a distant, muffled backdrop. Inside the cab, the silence was a sudden, profound relief. Stafford walked around and climbed into the driver's side, bringing a gust of cold, salt-laced air with him. He started the engine, and immediately turned the heater fan up high, directing the vents towards Aris. A blast of wonderfully hot air washed over Aris’s chilled hands and face, and he let out a long, shuddering sigh, the tension of the cold uncoiling from his muscles. He had been so consumed by the sublime spectacle of the view that he hadn't fully registered how deeply the cold had penetrated him. Stafford had.

"There's an old jumper in the back, if you want it," Stafford offered, his eyes on the road as he carefully navigated the ute back onto the narrow highway. "It's probably got some sawdust on it, but it's warm."

"No, this is perfect," Aris said, holding his hands up to the stream of hot air. "Thank you." He felt a profound sense of being cared for, a sensation so foreign it was almost disorienting. It was not the fussy, anxious care of a doctor or a concerned acquaintance. It was a quiet, practical, and deeply competent form of attention, a constant monitoring of the system to ensure its continued function. Stafford had diagnosed his chill and applied the remedy without any discussion, the same way he would diagnose a faulty wire. The feeling of being so thoroughly, so unobtrusively *seen* was more intimate than any conversation they had yet had.

They drove on, the road now weaving away from the cliff edge and plunging into the dense, temperate rainforest of the Otways. The character of the journey changed instantly. The vast, open expanse of sea and sky was replaced by a cathedral of green. Giant mountain ash and ancient, gnarled manna gums formed a towering canopy, filtering the afternoon sun into a dappled, shifting light that played across the dashboard. The air grew cooler, smelling of damp earth, eucalyptus, and decay. It was a different kind of sublime, enclosed and ancient, a world teeming with a slow, secret life. Aris watched the endless procession of giant ferns, their fronds unfurling in intricate, mathematical patterns, and felt the same sense of awe he had felt on the cliff, but this was quieter, more contemplative. It was a landscape that encouraged introspection. He found himself watching Stafford's hands on the steering wheel, sure and steady, guiding them through the winding, shadowy road. He thought of the story he had read to him, of Odysseus being guided from the wild shore into the civilized world of the Phaeacians. He felt like he was undergoing a similar transition, being led from the desolate shore of his own solitude into a world that was richer, more vibrant, and infinitely more real.

After another twenty minutes of winding through the forest, the road descended, the trees thinned, and they emerged into the bright sunlight of a small coastal settlement nestled in a curve of the bay. A handful of houses were scattered on the hillside, and a small, unpretentious general store and a café sat near the bridge over a river. "Kennett River," Stafford announced. "They do a good pie. You hungry?" Aris realized that he was, in fact, ravenously hungry. The sea air, the cold, the sheer emotional and sensory overload of the day had left him feeling hollowed out. "Yes," he said, the word coming out with a surprising fervour. "I could eat." Stafford smiled, a genuine, crinkling smile of satisfaction, and pulled the ute into the small, dusty car park beside the café.

The café was a simple, sun-bleached weatherboard building, with a few sturdy wooden tables inside and a glass counter displaying a selection of hearty, home-made pies and sausage rolls. It was the absolute antithesis of a fine-dining experience. Stafford ordered for them both without asking, a steak and mushroom pie for himself and a chicken and vegetable one for Aris, along with two mugs of strong, steaming tea. They took their food to a table outside, in a small, sun-drenched patch of grass that overlooked the river mouth where it met the sea. The pies came on plain white plates, their golden pastry flaky and inviting. Aris took a bite, and the rich, savoury filling was a revelation, a perfect, uncomplicated pleasure. It was the functional beauty of the Roman aqueduct, the principle of *utilitas*, made manifest in pastry. He ate with an appetite that he hadn't felt in years, the simple, honest food grounding him, warming him from the inside out. He looked at Stafford, who was eating his own pie with an easy, unselfconscious enjoyment, and felt a wave of simple, uncomplicated happiness.

"This is better than my roast chicken," Aris admitted, gesturing with his fork at the half-eaten pie. "There's a… directness to it. An honesty. My cooking was an attempt to prove something. This just… is."

Stafford swallowed a mouthful and considered this. "My mum makes a good roast," he said. "But sometimes you just need a pie. It's fit for purpose." He took a sip of his tea. "It's like what you were saying in class. About the Romans. It does the job it's meant to do. It gets you through the afternoon. It's not trying to be a work of art." He paused, looking out at the small waves breaking on the sand. "But there's a kind of art in that, too. In getting it just right." He looked back at Aris, his expression serious. "You got the chicken just right." The simple, direct compliment landed with more force than a page of glowing literary criticism. Aris felt a flush of pleasure so keen it was almost embarrassing. He had wanted to impress Stafford, to meet him with a display of his own form of competence, and it turned out that he had. The reciprocity was complete.

They finished their pies and sat for a while, nursing their hot mugs of tea, the comfortable silence settling around them once more. The sun was warm on their faces, and the sound of the birds in the gum trees and the gentle wash of the waves on the shore was a peaceful, constant rhythm. Aris felt a sense of contentment so profound it was almost unnerving. The restless, analytical engine of his mind had, for once, fallen silent. He wasn't dissecting the experience, he was simply having it. He was a man, sitting in the sun, drinking tea with another man, after a good meal. It was the simplest, most profound narrative he had ever been a part of. He felt Stafford shift beside him, and he turned to see him looking down the beach, a thoughtful expression on his face. "Want to go for a walk?" Stafford asked. "Stretch the legs before we head back." It was an invitation to extend the day, to draw out the final act just a little longer. An invitation to walk, side-by-side, into the rest of the afternoon. "Yes," Aris said, his own voice quiet but sure. "I'd like that very much."
