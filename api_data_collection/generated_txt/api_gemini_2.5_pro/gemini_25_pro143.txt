The rain in Oviedo didn't fall so much as it materialized, a fine mist called *orballu* that settled on your skin like a second, colder layer of self. It clung to the ancient stones of the cathedral, slicked the slate roofs until they gleamed like polished jet, and collected in the hollows of the cobblestones on Calle Gascona, blurring the reflections of the cider houses. Tallulah loved this rain. It was a secret whispered from the sky, a soft grey curtain that drew itself around the city, insulating it from the rest of the world. It was the way her love for Elara felt—a private atmosphere, breathable only by the two of them.

She walked, hands buried deep in the pockets of her coat, the worn wool a familiar comfort. Her path was a mindless circuit through the Casco Antiguo, the old quarter, a route she and Elara had traced a thousand times. She passed the Plaza de la Constitución, where the grand facade of the ayuntamiento looked down with stony indifference, its clock tower a silent accuser of passing time. Time. That was the enemy now. Time that Elara was spending away from her, time that was being stolen. But she wouldn't think about that yet. Not now. Instead, she let her mind drift back, back to the beginning, to the year the mist had first rolled in and enveloped her life in the form of Elara.

Her mother, Isabel, had fallen in love with a man named Javier with the sudden, violent force of a summer thunderstorm. It was an adult love, full of loud declarations in restaurants and showy weekend trips to coastal towns where they’d return with sand in their shoes and peeling noses. It was a public performance. Tallulah, then sixteen, had watched it with the detached curiosity of a naturalist observing a bizarre mating ritual. She’d been happy for her mother, of course, in a distant, theoretical way. Her own life, lived in the quiet apartment they’d shared since the divorce, had been one of books and shadows and the low thrum of her own inner world. Her mother’s bright, noisy love was an intrusion, a foreign frequency. And then Javier had brought his daughter. Elara.

The first meeting was a stilted affair in a cafe that smelled of burnt coffee and sugar. Elara was all elbows and ankles and a curtain of dark hair that she hid behind, a shield against the forced cheerfulness of their parents. Tallulah saw a mirror of her own discomfort in the other girl’s eyes. They exchanged few words, mumbled pleasantries that died in the air between them. But when Javier had made a loud, booming joke, and Isabel had laughed just a little too brightly, Tallulah’s eyes had met Elara’s across the table. In that shared glance, a silent treaty was signed. An acknowledgment of their shared predicament, their shared exile from this new, loud world their parents were building. They were two islands, and their parents were the churning, noisy sea between them.

Moving into Javier’s larger, more modern flat on the edge of the city had felt like a surrender. Tallulah’s small, dark room was replaced by a larger, brighter one she was now meant to share. The walls were a sterile white. Her familiar shadows had nowhere to hide. For the first week, they orbited each other like wary planets. The space between their two single beds was a gulf of unspoken rules and territories. Tallulah would read, her back to the room, feeling Elara’s presence as a change in the room’s air pressure. Elara would sketch in a notebook, the scratch of her pencil the only sound. It was an unbearable silence, thicker than the one Tallulah had cultivated for herself. This was a shared silence, and it was agonizing.

The breaking point came on a Tuesday night. Their parents were out again, performing their love for some other hapless couple. A storm had broken over Oviedo, a real one this time, not the gentle *orballu*. Rain lashed against the wide bedroom window, and thunder cracked the sky open. With one particularly violent clap, the power went out. The room plunged into an absolute, disorienting blackness. Tallulah froze, her book falling from her hands. She heard a small, sharp intake of breath from the other side of the room.
“Tallulah?” Elara’s voice was small, stripped of its earlier caution. It was just a voice in the dark.
“I’m here,” Tallulah answered, her own voice feeling strangely loud.
A long silence, filled only by the drumming of the rain.
“I don’t like the dark,” Elara confessed, the words barely a whisper.
Something in Tallulah shifted. A protective instinct she hadn’t known she possessed surged through her. This wasn’t a rival for territory. This was a girl, scared of the dark. “Me neither,” she lied. She’d always found comfort in it.
She heard a rustling of sheets. “Can I…?” The question hung unfinished in the air.
Tallulah understood. “Yes.”
The sound of bare feet on the wooden floor, hesitant steps. Then, a dip in her own mattress. Elara slid under the covers, her body a source of radiating warmth in the cold room. She was careful not to touch, maintaining a sliver of distance, but her heat crossed the gap. They lay there, side by side, listening to the storm rage outside their new, shared sanctuary. Tentatively, Tallulah reached out a hand, not knowing what she intended, and her fingers brushed against Elara’s. Elara didn’t pull away. Instead, her fingers curled, intertwining with Tallulah’s. It was not a sisterly hand-hold. It was a lifeline. In the absolute darkness, with the storm as their witness, they held on, and the silence was no longer unbearable. It was full. It was theirs.

From that night on, the room was no longer a territory to be divided but a world to be shared. The space between their beds shrank until the frames were touching, a makeshift double. They talked for hours, their voices low, weaving a tapestry of secrets in the dark. Elara’s sketches were no longer hidden; she drew the gargoyles of the cathedral, the crooked smile of the old man who sold chestnuts, the way Tallulah’s hair curled behind her ear. Tallulah, in turn, read her favorite poems aloud, her voice shaping the words of Lorca and Cernuda, feeling as though she were writing them for Elara for the first time. They discovered they were not two islands, but two halves of a single, secret continent, hidden beneath the surface of their parents’ oblivious ocean.

Their love bloomed in the cracks of the city. A stolen kiss, tasting of coffee and rain, in the shadow of the Foncalada, the ancient fountain hidden away on a nondescript street. Their hands clasped together in the darkness of a cinema, a silent, electric secret while some meaningless American film played out on screen. They learned the map of each other’s bodies with the same reverence they explored the city’s hidden corners. The curve of Elara’s hip was as familiar as the bend in Calle de la Rúa; the freckles on her shoulders were a constellation more intimate than any in the night sky.

“What are you thinking about?” Elara would whisper, her breath warm against Tallulah’s neck as they lay tangled in their sheets, the pale morning light filtering through the blinds.
Tallulah would trace the line of Elara’s collarbone with a fingertip. “That this is the only real thing,” she’d say, and she meant it with a terrifying ferocity. Their parents’ marriage, their classes at the university, the entire bustling, oblivious world outside their window—it was all a poorly constructed stage play. The reality was here, in this bed, in the scent of Elara’s skin and the steady, quiet rhythm of her breathing. Elara was not just a part of her world; she *was* her world. And Tallulah would be its sole, devoted guardian. She would keep it safe. She would keep it pure. She would let nothing and no one else in.The memory was so vivid, so warm, that the sudden, deep clang of a cathedral bell was a physical shock. It shattered the past, scattering the pieces like startled birds, and left Tallulah standing cold on a street corner, the *orballu* cool on her face. The remembered scent of Elara’s skin was replaced by the sharp, acidic tang of cider and wet stone. The warmth of their intertwined hands in the dark was just a ghost, and the chill in her own, buried deep in her pockets, was absolute. The circuit she walked was no longer a comfort; it was a cage. Each step, once a pilgrimage to a shared memory, was now just a measure of the distance Elara had put between them.

Berlin. The word itself was harsh, angular, a piece of gravel in Tallulah’s mouth. It wasn’t a secret whispered from the sky; it was a shout from a loudspeaker. Six months. An artist’s residency. A prestigious, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That’s what Javier and Isabel had called it, their faces beaming with a vicarious, proprietary pride. That’s what Elara had called it, her eyes shining with an excitement that had felt like a blade twisting in Tallulah’s gut. She had tried to be happy for her, had tried to mouth the correct, supportive words. But all she could see was their world, their carefully constructed continent, being deliberately fractured. Elara was choosing to leave their atmosphere, to see if she could breathe the air of somewhere else, and Tallulah was left behind, suffocating.

“It’s just six months, Tally,” Elara had said, her hands tracing the anxious line of Tallulah’s jaw. They were in their room, the same room where they had first held hands in the dark, but the space felt alien. The walls seemed to be closing in, and Elara’s suitcase, open and hungry on the floor, was a gaping wound. “I’ll be back before the chestnuts are in season again. We’ll call every day. It will be like I’m not even gone.” But she was already gone. The light in her eyes was different, a reflection of a future that Tallulah couldn’t see, a future that Elara was building without her. Tallulah had wanted to scream, to chain her to the bed, to remind her that their love was meant to be a fortress, not a departure lounge. Instead, she had simply pulled away, the silence between them returning, but this time it was not full, not theirs. It was a cold, jagged void.

Her mindless wandering had an inevitable destination. She found herself standing across the street from their apartment building, a bland, modern structure that had no business housing a love as ancient and mythic as theirs. She looked up at the fourth-floor window, their window. It was dark. Of course it was dark. The light of their world was a thousand miles away, illuminating the foreign streets of Berlin. For a moment, she imagined Elara there, sketching in a new notebook, capturing the hard edges of a different city, the faces of strangers. The thought was a physical pain. She couldn’t go up there, not yet. To enter that space alone would be to finally, formally admit that the world they had built, the world Tallulah had sworn to protect, was now just a room. An empty room, full of ghosts and the lingering scent of a love that had promised to be everything, and was now just a memory replayed on a rainy afternoon.Turning away from the dark window felt like turning her back on a grave. The thought was morbid, but it was true. Something had died, or at least, had been put into a state of suspended animation so deep it felt like death. Her feet, seemingly of their own accord, carried her away from the sterile modernity of the new flat and back towards the ancient, beating heart of the city. She found herself on Calle Gascona, the famed "cider boulevard." Even on a damp weeknight, the street was alive. The bright lights of the *sidrerías* spilled out onto the wet cobblestones, creating shimmering, distorted pools of gold. The air was thick with the sharp, fermented apple scent of the cider, the sizzle of chorizo cooked in it, and the boisterous sounds of conversation and laughter that echoed from the doorways.

She pushed into the nearest one, a place called Tierra Astur, its walls lined with dark wood and countless green bottles. The noise was a physical assault, a wall of sound she had to shoulder her way through. Men in work clothes stood at the high bar, their voices raised over the din. Families were crowded around heavy wooden tables. And everywhere, the ritual. The waiters, with practiced, almost theatrical grace, would raise a bottle of cider high above their head in one hand, and hold a wide-mouthed glass low in the other. A thin, perfect stream of pale gold liquid would arc through the air, hitting the side of the glass with a splash and a fizz, aerating it, unlocking its flavour. The dregs were then casually tossed onto the sawdust-strewn floor. It was a performance, loud and public and messy. It was everything she and Elara had held in contempt, yet they had come here sometimes, hiding in a corner, turning the public spectacle into a private joke.

Tallulah found an empty stool at the far end of the bar, a small patch of quiet in the storm. She ordered a bottle, and the barman poured her the first *culín*, the small serving, with an indifferent flourish. She watched the tiny bubbles rise and dissipate. She and Elara had shared glasses here, their heads bent close together, whispering. Elara had tried to mimic the pouring technique once, in the privacy of their kitchen, drenching the floor and themselves in cider, their laughter echoing in the small space, a sound so pure and joyous it had felt sacred. Tallulah lifted the glass and drank. The cider was cold, bracingly acidic, a shock to the system. It tasted nothing like her memory. It tasted of being alone.

Her phone vibrated in her pocket, a dull buzz against her thigh. For a wild, hopeful second, she thought it might be Elara calling, a tearful confession that she’d made a mistake, that she was coming home. But it was just a message. She pulled the phone out, her thumb hovering over the notification. The screen lit up with a picture. It was Elara, smiling, her face framed by that familiar curtain of dark hair, but the background was all wrong. She was standing in front of a graffiti-covered wall, a vast, brutalist concrete structure behind her. The East Side Gallery. Her smile was wide, genuine, and utterly untroubled. The text beneath it read: *¡Hola mi amor! Berlin is incredible. So much inspiration everywhere. Missing you like crazy, but this is… wow. Just wow. Talk tomorrow? Besos!*

Tallulah stared at the image, at the face she knew better than her own, looking so happy, so vibrant, so far away. *Missing you like crazy.* The words were a casual, thoughtless lie, a platitude thrown across a continent. If Elara missed her, she would not be smiling like that. If she missed their world, she would not be so dazzlingly alive in another one. The cider in her stomach soured. The noise of the bar faded to a dull, meaningless roar. The carefully constructed stage play of the world, the one she and Elara had watched from their private sanctuary, was no longer just a play. Elara had left her seat in the audience and jumped onto the stage, eager to play a part. And she had left Tallulah alone in the dark. A cold, hard certainty began to crystallize in her chest, sharp as a shard of glass. This passivity, this waiting, this mournful pilgrimage through their shared past—it was a fool's game. It was surrender. Elara had said it would be like she wasn't even gone, but she was. She had left a void, and a void could not be allowed to remain empty. It had to be filled. Or it had to be closed. Tallulah finished the cider in one quick, bitter swallow, the acidic tang a promise on her tongue. She dropped a few coins on the bar, slid off the stool, and walked out of the noise and the light, back into the soft, grey embrace of the *orballu*. The mist no longer felt like a secret; it felt like a shroud. And as she walked, her path was no longer a mindless circuit. It was a straight line toward a decision.## Chapter 2

The key in her hand felt like a cold, sharp-edged stone. Her walk from Calle Gascona was not a drift but a march, each step a hammer blow against the slick pavement. The city’s ancient, comforting curves now seemed to mock her, the twisting alleys of the Casco Antiguo a labyrinth she suddenly had to navigate with cold purpose. The *orballu* was no longer a caress but an infiltration, seeping through the wool of her coat, chilling her not with melancholy, but with a clear, sharp-edged resolve. She had been mourning a world. Now she understood she had to fight for it. Reaching the bland facade of their building, she didn’t hesitate. The lock turned with a definitive, metallic snick, a sound that severed the present from the immediate past. The door swung open into silence.

Inside, the air was still and close, holding the faint, ghostly scent of Elara’s perfume and the lemon-scented cleaner their parents insisted on. It was the smell of a life on pause. In the living room, a framed photograph sat on a side table: Isabel and Javier, beaming on a beach, their arms wrapped around each other in that performative way that had first united their daughters against them. They looked happy, oblivious, inhabitants of a completely different reality. Tallulah had always pitied their simple, sun-drenched world, so lacking in the profound, stormy depth of her own. But as she looked at it now, a bitter thought took root: perhaps their world was the real one, the one that endured, while hers had been a fragile, rain-swept illusion. She moved past the photograph without a second glance, her target the last door on the left. Their room. The sanctuary. The grave.

The sight of it was a fresh wound. The two beds, pushed together to form their island, now looked like a clumsy, temporary arrangement. The space where Elara’s suitcase had gaped open was just an empty patch of floor. Her side of the bed was too neat, the duvet pulled taut, the pillow un-dented by a sleeping head. It was a room that had been tidied for departure. A place that had been left. Tallulah pulled out her phone again, the screen’s harsh light cutting through the gloom. She stared at the picture from Berlin, at Elara’s bright, open smile. She zoomed in, examining the crinkle around her eyes, the slight part of her lips. It was a smile of discovery, of delight. It was a smile that was not for her. The text, *Missing you like crazy*, now read as a profound and deliberate cruelty, a bone thrown to a dog to keep it from barking. Elara wasn’t missing their world; she was celebrating her escape from it. The rage that had been a cold, hard crystal in her chest began to melt, turning into something hot and fluid that burned through her veins.

She needed to know. She needed to understand the true shape of this betrayal. She began a slow, methodical search, a violation she justified as an act of preservation. She opened the doors to Elara’s side of the shared wardrobe first. A row of familiar shirts and sweaters. She reached out and buried her face in a soft, grey jumper, inhaling deeply. Elara’s scent—that mix of charcoal pencils, clean cotton, and something uniquely her—filled her lungs. For a moment, her resolve wavered, and a wave of pure, desperate longing washed over her. This was her Elara. This was real. But the image of the Berlin smile flashed in her mind, and the longing curdled back into anger. She let the jumper fall and turned to the desk. Pencils, pens, a stack of paper. A few abandoned sketchbooks. She ran her hand over them, her fingertips tracing the worn cardboard covers. Elara’s art was a part of their shared language, the most intimate part. Her drawings were a record of their world. Or so she had thought.

She picked up an older book, one from two years ago, from that first stilted summer before the storm and the blackout had changed everything. She flipped through the early pages. There were the expected, skillful sketches: the gargoyles of the cathedral, the ironwork of the balconies on Calle Uria, a study of their parents laughing, captured with an almost clinical distance. Then she found them. A series of pages, filled not with stone or architecture, but with a face. A boy’s face. Tallulah recognized him instantly. Marcos Vega, a boy from their class at the *instituto*, all swagger and easy charm. Elara had drawn him over and over again. In profile, his gaze distant. Looking straight on, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips. One sketch was just of his hands, strong and capable, holding a guitar. They were not clinical studies. They were tender, obsessive, imbued with the same focused adoration she had seen in the later drawings of herself. The world had not started with the *orballu*. It had not started with the shared silence in a sterile white room. Tallulah was not the beginning of the story. She had merely been the next chapter. And chapters end.

A profound, terrifying clarity settled over her. She had built her entire existence around a myth of her own making: that their love was a singular creation, a fortress built for two. But Elara had built other things before. She had loved other things. This Berlin residency wasn't a sudden fracture; it was a pattern. It was the next thing. And Tallulah would not be a fond memory, a chapter to be reread on a nostalgic afternoon. She would not be a sketchbook full of tender drawings, left behind in a drawer. The role of guardian was not a passive one. You didn't just tend the flame; you built the furnace higher, hotter, until its light was the only one anyone could see. She closed the sketchbook, the soft thud of the cover a final, percussive sound in the quiet room. She looked at her phone, at the blinking cursor waiting for a reply. Her fingers, steady now, began to move across the screen. There would be no accusations, no pleading. Only a single, perfectly aimed stone, sent to ripple the waters of Elara's bright new world.

*Berlin looks amazing. That wall reminds me of your old sketchbook, the one with all the drawings of Marcos. I was just looking at it. The apartment feels so empty. I keep hearing noises in the night, it’s silly. Just the building settling, I guess. It’s just not the same without you. I miss you. Come back soon.*She pressed send. The message vanished from her screen, an arrow shot into the digital dark, aimed at a heart a thousand miles away. For a second, there was nothing but the hum of the refrigerator from the kitchen and the faint, persistent whisper of the rain against the glass. The phone in her hand felt heavy, no longer a portal to Elara but an instrument of war. A profound, unsettling calm settled over her. The frantic energy of her grief had been channeled, focused into a single, sharp point. She had acted. She had ceased to be a passive victim of circumstance and had become an agent in her own story once more. The room, their sanctuary, did not feel empty anymore. It felt like a command post, and she was its sole, vigilant occupant.

The wait was a new kind of torment. She couldn’t sit still, couldn't read, couldn't lose herself in the familiar shadows of her books. They seemed like relics from another life, the life of a girl who believed in the safety of private worlds. She paced the length of the apartment, from the dark window of their bedroom to the living room and back again, a caged animal wearing a path in the floor. Every creak of the building, every distant rumble of a passing car, was a potential prelude to the vibration of her phone. She re-read the message she had sent, dissecting each word. The casual mention of Marcos felt like a masterpiece of cruelty. It wasn't an accusation; it was a reminder, a piece of shared history repurposed as a weapon, designed to lodge itself under Elara's skin and remind her that Tallulah was the keeper of all her histories, even the ones she’d rather forget. The feigned fear, the noises in the night—that was for guilt. It was a hook, baited and cast.

Hours passed. The sky outside the window deepened from slate grey to an inky, starless black. She made coffee she didn't drink, staring at the dark liquid as if it held an answer. She imagined Elara receiving the message. Would it be in a crowded, noisy gallery? A stark white studio? Would she be alone, or with new friends whose faces Tallulah couldn’t even picture? The thought of those unknown faces was an infestation. Finally, just as she was beginning to believe her arrow had missed its mark entirely, the phone buzzed on the countertop. It was a text, not a call. The choice was a small, sharp sting. A call was an immediate confrontation; a text was a managed response. With a trembling finger, she opened it. *Marcos Vega? Tally, that was a lifetime ago! You are being so dramatic. Don’t look at that old stuff, it’s embarrassing! I’m sorry you feel lonely. Try putting on some music. It’s not the same for me either, but it's an adventure. We’ll talk properly tomorrow, okay? It’s late here.*

Tallulah read the message once. Twice. A third time. Each word was a tiny, dismissive pat on the head. *Dramatic. Silly. Embarrassing.* Elara wasn't wounded; she was mildly annoyed, handling an over-emotional girlfriend from a safe distance. She was managing her. The casual ease with which she swatted away the mention of Marcos was the most infuriating part. It meant he hadn't mattered. It meant that Tallulah, too, could be relegated to an "embarrassing" old sketchbook someday. The advice to "put on some music" was a breathtaking act of condescension, as if her profound, world-altering ache could be soothed by a simple playlist. The adventure was still happening. The new world was still winning. The cold crystal of rage in her chest, which had briefly melted, now re-formed, larger and sharper than before. This indirect assault had been a miscalculation. A gentle tremor was not enough to bring Elara back. She needed an earthquake.

A new plan began to form, not born of frantic passion, but of a chilling, lucid logic. Elara had insulated herself, putting a continent and a new life between them. A direct attack would only make her retreat further into that new life, justifying the distance. But there was a backdoor into her world, a line of communication that couldn't be so easily managed or ignored. Their parents. Isabel and Javier. The churning, oblivious sea. Tallulah had always disdained their loud, public emotions, but now she saw their use. She could create a storm in that sea so violent that its waves would crash against the shores of Berlin. She would not need to scream; their parents would do it for her. She would not need to plead; their concern would be her proxy.

She stood before the full-length mirror on the wardrobe door. The girl who stared back was pale, her eyes dark-rimmed from a night of manufactured grief and genuine rage. It was a good start. She had spent years cultivating a quiet, reserved persona, a life lived in shadows. Now, she would simply deepen those shadows until they were impossible to ignore. She would not be the jilted lover; that was too obvious, too vulgar. She would be the fragile, heartbroken daughter, wilting without her other half. The performance had to be flawless. It would be in the details: the food left untouched on her plate, the book held for hours on an unread page, the way she would flinch at loud noises, the hollow look in her eyes when her mother asked if she was alright. She would become a ghost in their bright, modern flat, a silent, sorrowful accusation that would unnerve them, worry them, and eventually, compel them to act. They would call Elara, their voices thick with concern. *Tallulah isn’t well. She isn’t herself. This separation is destroying her. Maybe you should come home.* Tallulah looked at her reflection, and for the first time, a slow, cold smile touched her lips. Elara wanted to be a part of the world’s grand, messy play. Fine. Tallulah would simply write her a new part, one she would have no choice but to perform: the role of the rescuer. And the only way to play that part was to come home.The performance began the next evening. Javier and Isabel returned from a weekend in Gijón, their voices loud and full of sea air as they burst through the door, bearing bags of pastries and the lingering scent of salt. They found Tallulah in the living room, curled in an armchair, a thick volume of poetry open on her lap. She had been on the same page for over an hour. She didn’t look up immediately when they came in, forcing Isabel to call her name twice. When she finally did, she blinked slowly, as if adjusting to a sudden, painful light.

“Tally? Goodness, you look like you’ve seen a ghost,” Isabel said, her bright smile faltering for a fraction of a second. She placed a pastry box on the coffee table. “We brought your favorite, *carbayones*. Did you eat?”

Tallulah’s eyes drifted to the box, then away again, her expression unreadable. “I wasn’t hungry,” she said, her voice a low murmur, barely audible over the sound of Javier unpacking in the hallway. The lie was the first stone laid in the new foundation of her plan. She had, in fact, methodically eaten a bowl of yogurt and an apple two hours earlier in the cold, silent kitchen, fueling the machine of her body for the work ahead.

At dinner, she perfected the art of absence. Javier had made a grand, steaming platter of seafood paella, its saffron aroma filling the apartment. He served her a generous portion, his movements full of a paternal pride that grated on Tallulah’s nerves. She picked up her fork and pushed a single shrimp around the plate, separating it from the rice, then nudging a mussel to the other side. She brought a single grain of rice to her lips, then set the fork down, her hand falling into her lap. She stared at the window, at the reflection of the brightly lit room against the blackness of the night, and let her focus soften until the image blurred, her expression one of profound, listless sorrow.

“Tallulah, eat,” Isabel finally snapped, her patience worn thin. The noisy cheerfulness she projected required an audience, and Tallulah’s silent refusal to participate was a form of dissent. “You can’t just starve yourself. Is this about Elara? Because this pining is getting ridiculous. She’s having an incredible time.”

The words were a gift. Tallulah didn't react with anger or protest. Instead, she allowed her lower lip to tremble, just for a second. She looked at her mother, her eyes wide and glistening with unshed tears she had carefully summoned by thinking of a stray dog she’d seen years ago. “I’m just… tired,” she whispered, then pushed her chair back. “May I be excused?” She didn’t wait for an answer, retreating to the sanctuary of her room, leaving the scent of saffron and her mother’s rising tide of anxious frustration behind her. She heard their voices as she closed her door, Javier’s a low rumble, Isabel’s a sharp, worried counterpoint. The first cracks were appearing in their oblivious sea.

Over the next week, she deepened the shadows. She became a master of the small, unnerving details. She would leave cups of tea to go cold on windowsills. She would stand in the middle of a room for long moments, as if she had forgotten why she’d entered it. During a video call with Elara—a call Elara had initiated, her tone brisk and full of the day’s activities—Tallulah remained mostly silent, her face a mask of weary sadness. She angled the phone so the untouched plate of food on her desk was just visible in the frame. “Are you okay, Tally? You seem quiet,” Elara had asked, a flicker of annoyance in her eyes. Tallulah had simply offered a weak, watery smile. “Just missing your voice,” she’d said, a statement that was both a lie and the truest thing in the world.

The breaking point, when it came, was as carefully orchestrated as a scene in a play. It was a Saturday afternoon, and their parents were home. Tallulah knew Isabel was planning to call Elara for their weekly family chat. She waited in her room until she heard her mother’s footsteps approaching down the hall. Taking a deep breath, she picked up a heavy glass paperweight from her desk—a gift from Elara, a swirl of blue and green that was supposed to represent the Cantabrian Sea—and let it slip from her hand. It hit the wooden floor with a sickening crack, loud enough to be an alarm.

Isabel burst into the room without knocking. “Tallulah! What was that? Are you alright?” She found Tallulah on her knees, not crying, but staring at her own hands with a look of dazed horror, as if they had betrayed her. “I… I don’t know,” Tallulah stammered, her voice shaking with practiced shock. “It just… fell.” Isabel knelt beside her, her earlier irritation replaced by a rush of maternal fear. She took Tallulah’s hands in hers. They were ice cold. “My God, you’re freezing. And you’re so pale. This has gone too far.”

Isabel helped her to the bed, fussing over her, pulling the duvet around her shoulders. Tallulah allowed herself to be moved, her body limp and unresponsive. She was a doll, a fragile thing broken by neglect. As her mother left the room, speaking in low, urgent tones to Javier, Tallulah strained her ears. She heard the scrape of a chair from the kitchen, and then Isabel’s voice, artificially bright at first, then quickly losing its cheer.

“Lari? Hi, sweetheart, how are you?… Yes, everything’s fine, fine… Well, actually, no, it’s not.” A pause. Tallulah could picture Elara on the other end, her brow furrowed in confusion. “It’s Tally. I’m worried about her. No, she’s not sick, not exactly. She’s just… fading. She doesn’t eat, she barely speaks. She just dropped something, and the look on her face… It was like she didn’t even know what had happened.” Isabel’s voice cracked, and Tallulah knew, with a surge of cold triumph, that the emotion was genuine. Her mother was truly scared. “I don’t think she’s handling this well at all. I know your work is important, mi vida, I know it is. But she needs you. I think… I think you need to come home.” The plea hung in the air, a perfectly executed checkmate. Tallulah closed her eyes, letting the duvet press down on her. She had done it. She had turned their parents' love into a weapon and aimed it directly at the heart of Berlin. Now, all she had to do was wait for the echo of the impact.## Chapter 3

The quiet that followed Isabel’s phone call was of a different quality than the silence Tallulah had previously cultivated. It was no longer a void, but a space thick with anticipation, like the charged air before a lightning strike. She remained in bed, a willing invalid, listening to the muffled sounds of her mother and Javier moving about the apartment. Their footsteps were softer now, their voices lowered to conspiratorial whispers. When Isabel brought her a cup of chamomile tea and a piece of dry toast on a tray, her movements were tentative, as if Tallulah were made of spun glass. Tallulah accepted the offering with a weak, grateful smile and took a single, deliberate bite of the toast, a performance of effort for her mother's benefit. She was no longer the ghost at their feast; she was the patient, and they were her anxious, devoted nurses. The power dynamic in the household had shifted entirely, and its new center was the bed where Tallulah lay, patiently waiting.

The call came the following afternoon. The name ‘Elara’ flashed on her screen, and for a moment, Tallulah’s carefully constructed calm was threatened by a jolt of pure, triumphant adrenaline. She let it ring three times, a small act of control, before answering. She did not say hello. She simply opened the line and waited, breathing softly into the receiver, casting herself as too weak to even initiate a conversation. The silence stretched for a beat, then two, before Elara’s voice, tight and cold as a wire, cut through it.

“What game are you playing, Tallulah?” There was no preamble, no term of endearment. It was the voice of a stranger, an accuser. “Mom called me, hysterical. She said you’re falling apart, that you’re not eating, that you need me. She wants me to come home.” Each word was a small, hard pellet of accusation.

Tallulah closed her eyes, gathering the threads of her performance. She let out a shaky breath, a sound of profound weariness. “It’s not a game, Lari,” she whispered, her voice fragile and hoarse. The nickname, which she had so recently weaponized, was now a plea. “Why would you think it’s a game?”

“Because it’s what you do!” Elara’s voice rose, cracking with a frustration that had clearly been simmering for hours. “You retreat, you go silent, you make everyone orbit your unhappiness! You did it when we first moved in together, and you’re doing it now. A paperweight? Really? You’re so transparent.”

The accusation was a scalpel, and it cut close to the bone, but Tallulah did not flinch. She had anticipated this. She absorbed the anger and repurposed it, letting it fuel the tremor in her own voice. “Transparent? You think my world falling apart is transparent?” A single, perfect tear, hot and real, escaped her eye and tracked a path down her temple. “I’m sorry if my pain is an inconvenience to your ‘adventure.’ I’m sorry I can’t just put on some music and pretend you didn’t rip a hole in the middle of my life. I look at your side of the bed and I can’t breathe. The whole city feels wrong, like a reflection in a broken mirror. But you’re right. I’m just being dramatic. Forgive me.” The speech ended in a choked sob, a sound she cut off abruptly, as if trying and failing to be brave.

The silence that followed was different. It was not the cold silence of anger, but the heavy, uncomfortable silence of guilt. Tallulah could almost hear the war waging within Elara, the battle between her exhilarating new freedom and the old, powerful loyalty to the world they had built. She could picture her, standing in a bright Berlin studio, surrounded by her new life, being pulled back by an invisible, unbreakable tether to a dark room in Oviedo.

“Tally… I…” Elara’s voice was softer now, the anger gone, replaced by a weary confusion. “I didn’t… I don’t want you to be in pain.”

“Then don’t be,” Tallulah said, her voice impossibly small. It was the masterstroke. Not a demand, but a release. Not an ultimatum, but a sigh of surrender. “Stay. Be happy. It’s what you want. I’ll be fine. Eventually.” She injected a faint, unconvincing note of stoicism into the last word, the verbal equivalent of a brave smile through tears. She had passed the burden entirely. Now, for Elara to stay in Berlin would not be an act of self-fulfillment, but an act of deliberate cruelty. It was a choice between her ambition and Tallulah’s survival. And Tallulah knew, with the absolute certainty of a zealot, which one Elara would be forced to choose. She listened to the sound of Elara’s unsteady breathing, the sound of a fortress wall beginning to crumble.The long-distance line hissed with the sound of Elara’s broken resolve. Finally, a ragged sigh, the sound of a flag of surrender being run up a pole in a battle that had been lost before it was truly fought. “Okay,” Elara said, the single word hollowed out, stripped of all its Berlin vibrancy. It was a word that belonged to Oviedo now, to the grey mist and the silent rooms. “Okay, Tally. Don’t cry. I’ll… I’ll look at flights.” The promise was an anchor, dropped from a thousand miles away, and Tallulah could feel its chain pulling taut, drawing their sundered continent back together. She let out one last, shuddering breath into the phone. “Thank you,” she whispered, as if Elara had just granted her the greatest, most selfless gift, and not simply buckled under the unbearable weight of manufactured guilt.

After hanging up, Tallulah lay perfectly still in the dim light of the bedroom. The tears dried on her skin, feeling cool and tight. There was no elation, no joy, only the deep, resonant satisfaction of a complex equation solved correctly. Her world had tilted off its axis, and with careful, deliberate force, she had righted it. She had proven that their private atmosphere was not a choice; it was a biological necessity for them both. Elara had tried to breathe a different air and had been forced to recognize she could not survive it. Tallulah turned her head on the pillow and looked at Elara’s side of their shared bed. It was no longer a barren landscape of loss. It was a space being prepared, a territory reclaimed, waiting for its rightful occupant to return to the only home that would ever truly hold her.

She waited an hour before emerging from her room, composing her face into a mask of fragile, exhausted relief. She found Isabel in the kitchen, anxiously wiping down an already spotless counter. Tallulah leaned against the doorframe, letting her mother see the change in her before she spoke. The haunted, distant look was gone, replaced by a deep, bone-weary calm. “I spoke to Lari,” she said, her voice still quiet, but without the brittle edge of despair. Isabel stopped wiping, her whole body tensing. “She’s coming home.” Isabel’s face crumpled with relief. She rushed to Tallulah, enfolding her in a hug that smelled of lemon cleaner and maternal anxiety. “Oh, Tally. Oh, mi amor. That’s wonderful. She is such a good girl, your Elara. Such a good, good girl.” Tallulah closed her eyes and sank into the embrace, a cold, secret smile playing on her lips. Elara was good. She was learning, once again, to be good.

In the days that followed, a miraculous recovery began. Tallulah started to eat, small portions at first, which Isabel would celebrate as if they were major victories. She allowed color to return to her cheeks. She was seen reading in the armchair again, this time actually turning the pages. To Javier and Isabel, it was as if the sun had finally broken through a long, oppressive bank of cloud, and the cause was clear: Elara’s imminent return was the cure. They spoke of Elara’s sacrifice in hushed, reverent tones, never once suspecting that the illness and the cure had both been prescribed by the patient herself. Tallulah played her part with quiet perfection, allowing their narrative to flourish. She was the wilting flower, and Elara was the rain she could not live without. It was a simple, beautiful story, and her parents’ eager acceptance of it made it all the more powerful.

On the day of Elara’s arrival, the air in the apartment was thick with a strange, celebratory tension. Isabel cooked Elara’s favorite meal, *fabada asturiana*, a rich, heavy bean stew that seemed ill-suited for a homecoming that felt more like a state funeral. Tallulah declined to go with them to the airport, claiming she was still too tired for such a public place. In truth, she knew the reunion had to happen on her terms, on their ground. She waited in their room, the sanctuary, the epicenter of the earthquake she had caused. She had showered and dressed in a soft, cream-colored sweater, the picture of gentle vulnerability. She sat on the edge of her bed, her hands folded in her lap, and listened. She heard the front door open, the sound of bags being dropped, the bright, forced chatter of her parents. Then, footsteps, hesitant and heavy, coming down the hall.

Elara appeared in the doorway and stopped, her silhouette framed against the brighter light of the hall. She looked thinner, and the vibrant, exploratory light in her eyes had been extinguished, replaced by a deep, bruised weariness. The effortless chic of her Berlin clothes looked out of place here, like a costume from another life. She was no longer a discoverer of new worlds; she was a soldier returning from a war she had lost. For a long moment, they simply looked at each other across the quiet room. All the anger, the manipulation, the thousands of miles, and the unspoken betrayals hung in the space between them. Tallulah saw the resentment in the tight set of Elara’s jaw, but she also saw the familiar, helpless pull of their shared history in her dark eyes. Slowly, Tallulah rose from the bed and opened her arms. It was an invitation, a command, and a final, undeniable claim. “You’re home,” she whispered, and her voice was the sound of the soft grey *orballu*, a mist settling in, blurring the edges of everything else, insulating them from the rest of the world once more.Elara moved as if wading through water, each step an effort against an invisible current. She crossed the small space and allowed herself to be drawn into Tallulah’s arms, but it was an embrace of ghosts. Her body was stiff, unyielding, a statue of a girl who used to live here. Tallulah felt the foreign chill on her clothes, the faint, alien scent of a different city’s air, and she held on a beat too long, pressing her face into the curve of Elara’s neck, inhaling deeply as if to erase the smell of Berlin and replace it with her own. It was not a gesture of comfort, but of branding. When they finally separated, Elara’s eyes would not meet hers. They stared at a point just over Tallulah’s shoulder, a point somewhere in the past, or perhaps at a future that had just been stolen from her.

Dinner was an exercise in collective delusion. The heavy, meaty aroma of the *fabada* filled the apartment, a scent of tradition and homecoming that felt grotesquely out of place. Isabel and Javier filled the silence with a determined brightness, asking Elara questions about German museums and the public transport system, topics so mundane they became absurd in the face of the screaming tension at the table. Elara answered in clipped monosyllables, her gaze fixed on her own bowl, which she did not touch. She looked like a prisoner being interrogated. Across from her, Tallulah ate slowly, deliberately, each spoonful a testament to her miraculous recovery. She would occasionally cast a look of gentle, loving concern toward Elara, a look that said, *See? You are healing me already.* Javier, oblivious, raised his glass of wine. “To Elara,” he boomed. “For knowing what’s truly important. Family.” Elara flinched as if struck, and the look she shot Tallulah across the table was one of pure, undiluted venom.

The moment the meal was declared over, Elara stood. “I’m tired,” she announced to the room, though her words were meant for one. She turned and walked toward their bedroom without a backward glance. The click of the bedroom door shutting behind them was a gunshot severing them from the rest of the house. The performance was over. Elara didn’t turn on the main light, leaving the room in the intimate gloom of a single bedside lamp—Tallulah’s lamp. She began to undress, pulling off her travel-worn clothes with sharp, angry movements, as if shedding a contaminated skin. Tallulah watched her, her heart beating a slow, steady rhythm of victory. She reached out, intending to trace the familiar line of Elara’s spine. “Don’t,” Elara hissed, spinning around to face her, her half-naked body radiating a cold fury. “Don’t you dare touch me.”

“You didn’t even look at the work I was doing,” Elara’s voice was low, shaking with a rage that was all the more potent for being suppressed for hours. “You didn’t ask to see a single sketch. You don’t care about my art, my opportunity, my life. All you care about is this.” She gestured wildly around the room, at the two beds pushed together, at the walls that had heard all their secrets. “This room. This prison. You built a cage and got scared when you realized I knew how to fly. So you broke my wings to make me stay.” She took a step closer, her eyes, so often soft and full of adoration for Tallulah, were now hard and bright with hatred. “You used them. You used my father and your mother. You turned their love for us into a weapon. You faked a breakdown. You are sick, Tallulah. Not with sadness. With something much, much worse.”

Tallulah listened to the tirade without a change in her calm, placid expression. She absorbed the hatred, the accusations, and found them wanting. They were the predictable protestations of a patient fighting a necessary medicine. When Elara was finished, panting slightly in the charged silence, Tallulah took a step closer, invading the space Elara had tried to defend. “A cage?” she asked, her voice soft, reasonable, which made it all the more terrifying. “Is that what this is? I thought it was a sanctuary. I thought it was the only real place in the world.” She reached out again, and this time Elara didn’t have the strength to pull away. Tallulah’s fingers brushed a strand of dark hair from Elara’s cheek, a gesture of infinite tenderness that was also an act of supreme possession. “You weren’t flying, Lari. You were falling. I saw your picture. That smile wasn’t yours. It was a performance for a world that doesn’t love you, that will never know you. I didn’t break your wings. I caught you.” She leaned in, her lips close to Elara’s ear, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, the same whisper they had used to build their world in the dark. “You belong here. With me. You know you do. You just needed to be reminded.”## Chapter 4

The raw, vibrant hatred in Elara’s eyes was the most alive she had looked since stepping off the plane. It was a fire Tallulah was tempted to stoke, to see how brightly it could burn before it exhausted its fuel. But that was not her strategy. A fire would attract attention. A fire could burn the whole house down. What she needed was a slow, inexorable cooling, a return to the quiet, manageable glow of their shared world. So she let Elara’s words hang in the air, let them fall to the floor and die like spent embers. Her soft, whispered reply, "I caught you," was not an argument; it was a verdict. And its effect was devastating. The fight drained out of Elara in a single, shuddering exhalation. Her shoulders slumped. The fury in her eyes was doused, leaving behind a vast, empty landscape of despair. She was a general who had seen her final, desperate charge break against an unmovable wall. There was nothing left to do but surrender.

Wordlessly, Elara turned and slid between the cold sheets of her side of the bed, her back a rigid, unforgiving wall facing Tallulah. The space between their bodies, once a mere crease in their shared island, was now a canyon, miles deep and utterly dark. Tallulah undressed slowly, methodically, her own movements calm and deliberate. She slipped into her side of the bed, the familiar mattress a throne she had successfully defended. She did not reach for Elara. She did not whisper goodnight. She simply lay there in the gloom, listening. For a long time, the only sound was the faint hum of the city outside. Then, she heard it: a tiny, choked sound, a single sob swallowed before it could fully form. It was the sound of a wing breaking. Tallulah closed her eyes, not in triumph, but in a state of serene, vigilant satisfaction. The patient was beginning to accept her treatment. The long, slow work of healing could begin.

The next morning was a masterclass in domestic theatre. Isabel, radiating a determined cheerfulness, had set the breakfast table as if for a holiday. When Elara emerged from the bedroom, her face pale and swollen, her movements sluggish, Isabel’s smile only widened. “Lari! You must be exhausted, poor thing. The jet lag. Sit, sit. I made your favorite, toast with tomato and olive oil.” Elara sat down without a word, her eyes fixed on the grain of the wooden table. Tallulah, who had been chatting brightly with Javier about a new exhibition at the Fine Arts Museum, slid into the seat opposite Elara. “She barely slept,” Tallulah said, her voice a symphony of loving concern. “I think the journey just took everything out of her. We’ll have a quiet day. Maybe a little walk later, if she feels up to it. The fresh air will do her good.” Javier nodded in agreement, patting Elara’s hand. Elara didn’t move. She was a doll at their table, a prop in a play they were all writing for her.

Later that morning, the sky returned to its default setting: a soft, pearlescent grey from which the *orballu* descended, coating the city in a fine, reflective sheen. “Look,” Tallulah said, gesturing to the window. “The city is welcoming you home.” Elara, who was staring at a blank wall, did not respond. Tallulah pulled Elara’s familiar raincoat from the wardrobe and held it out. “Come on. Let’s walk our old route. Past the cathedral, through the Plaza del Fontán. It will be just like it was.” The final words were a promise and a threat. Elara looked at the coat, then at Tallulah’s expectant face, and the spark of defiance she possessed was too weak to ignite. With a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of her entire truncated future, she took the coat and followed Tallulah out of the apartment.

The streets of the Casco Antiguo, once their private kingdom, now felt like the landscaped grounds of a genteel prison. Tallulah walked with a light step, her hands back in the pockets of her own coat, a picture of contentment. She pointed out the things they had always loved: a particularly grotesque gargoyle on the cathedral facade, the new display of books in the window of their favorite shop, the way the mist collected on the iron lanterns. She kept up a gentle, one-sided stream of chatter, weaving a narrative of continuity, of a world that had simply been waiting for them to inhabit it again. Elara walked beside her, a silent shadow, her eyes downcast, watching her own feet on the slick cobblestones. The city was a blur of grey stone and wet slate. The secret whispered from the sky, the soft grey curtain, was no longer a comfort. It was the fabric of a shroud, wrapping itself around her, suffocating her.

They reached the Plaza de la Foncalada, the small, almost-hidden square that housed the ancient fountain. It was here, in the shadow of stone that had stood for over a thousand years, that they had shared their first real kiss, a secret so potent it had felt as if it could crack the city open. Tallulah stopped, her head tilted, a soft, nostalgic smile on her face. “Do you remember?” she whispered, her voice full of shared history. The air was heavy with the memory, tasting of rain and coffee and the beginning of everything. She turned to Elara, her eyes glowing with the intensity of her carefully curated love. She reached out, her fingers aiming to twine with Elara’s, to physically close the circuit and complete the reconstruction of their past. But as her hand drew near, Elara flinched back as if from a flame. She took a half-step away, her hands balling into fists at her sides. Her gaze, for the first time on their walk, lifted from the ground and met Tallulah’s. It was not a look of hatred, or even anger. It was a look of cold, profound negation. It was a silent, unequivocal “No.” The single, quiet act of rebellion was more powerful than any shouted accusation. It was a crack in the flawless surface of Tallulah’s restored world, a sign that the patient was not, in fact, healed at all.The silent, weightless gesture of Elara’s recoil landed with the force of a physical blow. Tallulah’s outstretched hand froze for a fraction of a second in the damp air, an offering rejected, a bridge dynamited. A flicker of something hot and sharp ignited behind her eyes, but she smothered it instantly, burying it deep beneath layers of practiced control. She let her hand fall to her side, not snatching it back in anger, but letting it drift down as if heavy with a sudden, unbearable sadness. She turned her face slightly away from Elara, toward the ancient, indifferent stones of the fountain, and allowed a look of profound, quiet hurt to settle over her features. She didn’t speak. The silence, layered with the memory of their first kiss and the fresh wound of this rejection, was a far more potent accusation.

They walked back to the apartment without another word exchanged. The gentle, one-sided monologue Tallulah had maintained was over, replaced by a silence that was a living entity between them, cold and sharp-edged. The *orballu* was no longer a shared secret; it was a cold, isolating medium that kept them suspended, a foot apart, in their separate miseries. Elara kept her eyes on the ground, but her posture had changed. The slump of defeat was gone, replaced by a rigid straightness, a silent, stubborn refusal to fold. Tallulah, for her part, projected a fragile melancholy, her pace slowing, her shoulders slightly stooped, as if the weight of Elara’s unspoken negation was a physical burden she was now forced to carry alone. By the time they reached the door of the apartment, the narrative was clear: Elara, in her coldness, was wounding the delicate, recovering Tallulah.

The days that followed fell into a pattern of strained, suffocating domesticity. Elara was compliant in her actions, but entirely absent in her spirit. She sat at the dinner table, she went on the slow, pointless walks, she answered direct questions from Isabel and Javier. But her eyes were vacant, her responses hollow echoes. She was a ghost haunting her own life, a beautifully rendered sketch that had been erased, leaving only a faint, stubborn smudge. Tallulah, meanwhile, perfected her role as the patient, caring warden. She would cut Elara’s food, pour her water, place a blanket over her legs in the evening, all with an air of gentle, selfless devotion. Each act of care was a silken thread, weaving a cage of obligation around Elara, a cage that their parents watched her build with beaming, approving eyes.

Elara’s only escape was in the dead of night. When the apartment was finally still and Tallulah’s breathing had deepened into what Elara prayed was genuine sleep, she would slip out of bed. In the bathroom, the only room with a lock, bathed in the cold, sterile light above the sink, she would take out the one thing she had managed to keep entirely for herself: a new sketchbook, bought in a small, sunlit art shop in Berlin. It was her last piece of that other life. But she did not draw the grand architecture or the vibrant street art of the city she had lost. Her pencil, moving with a feverish, silent intensity, gave form to her new reality. She drew the bars of the window as thick, grasping vines. She drew her own face, but with her mouth stitched shut. She sketched Tallulah, not as the girl she had loved, but as a creature of immense, beautiful shadow, a shadow that consumed everything it touched. One drawing depicted their two beds, but the space between them was a jagged chasm, and from its depths, hands made of smoke reached up to pull her down. It was a language of pure, voiceless rage, a catalogue of her own imprisonment, a truth she could only tell to the blank, silent page.

Tallulah was not a fool. She felt the change in Elara, the shift from hollow despair to a contained, internal resistance. She saw the compliance for what it was: a wall. Elara was no longer a patient passively accepting her fate; she was a prisoner, secretly sharpening a stone against the floor of her cell. Tallulah saw it in the way Elara’s eyes would sometimes focus on her with a clarity that was unnerving, a flash of assessment before the vacant look returned. She felt it in the utter lack of life in Elara’s side of the bed at night, a stillness that was not restful but coiled, like a spring being wound tighter and tighter. The silence in the room was no longer just the absence of their shared whispers; it was the sound of a secret being kept. And Tallulah, the self-appointed guardian of their world, could not tolerate a secret that was not her own.

The opportunity came on a Tuesday morning. Isabel, in a fit of manufactured normalcy, insisted that Elara accompany her to the market. "The walk will do you good, Lari. You need to see the sun," she’d chirped, ignoring the fact that the sky was its usual blanket of solid grey. Elara had acquiesced with her customary, lifeless nod, leaving Tallulah alone in the apartment. The moment she heard the front door close, Tallulah began her search. It was not a frantic, panicked rummage. It was a slow, methodical sweep, a security check of her own domain. She started with the obvious places: the desk drawers, the pockets of the coats Elara had taken to Berlin, the space beneath her mattress. Nothing. She stood in the middle of the room, her eyes scanning every surface, her mind working with a cold, clear logic. Where would Elara hide her last secret? Where would she keep the heart of her rebellion? Her eyes fell on the suitcase, the one that had sat like a gaping wound on the floor weeks ago, now tucked away at the bottom of Elara’s side of the wardrobe. It was the vessel that had taken her away, the symbol of her attempted escape. It was the perfect hiding place.

She pulled the suitcase out and laid it on the bed. Her fingers trembled slightly as she pulled the zipper. The scent of Berlin—a faint mix of diesel, street food, and different laundry detergent—rose up to meet her, a ghostly affront. Inside were clothes she had never seen, folded neatly. A few German books. And there, tucked beneath a dark green sweater, was the sketchbook. It was newer than the others, its cover stiff and unfamiliar. Tallulah lifted it out. It felt heavier than it should, weighted with its secrets. She sat on the edge of the bed, the same bed where she had waited for Elara’s return, and opened it. The first page was a drawing of the East Side Gallery wall, the one from the photograph, but in Elara’s rendering, the vibrant graffiti was peeling away to reveal a stark, grey concrete prison beneath. Page after page, the truth of Elara’s heart unfurled. She saw herself as the shadow creature, her hands elongated into grasping tendrils. She saw the drawing of the stitched mouth, the window bars, the chasm between their beds. It was a litany of hate, a meticulously illustrated diary of her own monstrosity. Tallulah felt a cold, calm fury settle into her bones. This was a betrayal far deeper than a desire for a new city or a different life. Elara had taken their most sacred language, the language of art that had first bound them together, and had twisted it into a weapon against her. She had used it to build a new world, a dark, secret one where Tallulah was the monster. She slowly closed the book, the soft thud of the cover a final, percussive sound in the absolute quiet of the room. She placed it precisely in the center of Elara’s pillow, an offering laid on an altar. Then she sat in the armchair opposite the bed, her hands folded in her lap, and waited for the heretic to come home.## Chapter 5

The wait was a period of perfect, crystalline stillness. Tallulah did not move from the armchair, her posture relaxed, her breathing even. She had become a part of the room’s geography, as fixed and silent as the wardrobe or the desk. The only motion was the slow, inexorable crawl of the grey light across the floorboards. She felt no anxiety, no nervousness, only the cold, clear-eyed focus of a predator that has set a flawless trap and now has nothing to do but wait for the satisfying, final click of its jaws. She heard the distant sounds of the city, a car horn, the rumble of a bus, but they were echoes from another world, irrelevant to the sealed atmosphere of this one. Then, she heard it. The sound of a key turning in the lock of the front door, followed by the bright, brittle cheer of her mother’s voice and Elara’s answering, toneless murmur. The prey had returned to the snare.

Isabel’s voice carried down the hall, chattering about the price of tomatoes, the freshness of the fish. It was a soundtrack of determined normalcy laid over a reality that was about to rupture. Tallulah heard Elara’s footsteps, slow and heavy, approaching the bedroom. They paused at the door. Tallulah did not turn her head. She kept her gaze fixed on the pillow where the sketchbook lay, a dark square of judgment on the white cotton. The door pushed open and Elara stepped inside, shrugging off her raincoat. She saw Tallulah then, a silent sentinel in the armchair, and a flicker of unease crossed her face. Her eyes followed Tallulah’s gaze, and in the next instant, she saw it. The sketchbook.

All the colour drained from Elara’s face, leaving it a stark, waxy white. Her breath hitched. Her body went rigid, a statue of pure, apprehended horror. For a long, silent moment, the only thing that moved was the faint, persistent mist swirling outside the window. Elara’s eyes darted from the book to Tallulah’s face, and in them, Tallulah saw the final, frantic death of hope. The secret was out. The last private corner of her soul had been invaded and exposed. Tallulah finally broke the silence, her voice as soft and calm as a layer of fresh snow falling on a battlefield. “I was tidying,” she said, the lie so simple, so domestic, it was obscene. “I found it. You’ve been working. I didn’t know.” She paused, letting the silence stretch. “They’re very good. So much passion. Is this me?”

The question, so gently posed, was a lit match dropped on a trail of gasoline. Something in Elara snapped. The fear in her eyes was consumed by a sudden, blazing inferno of rage. “Yes,” she hissed, her voice a raw, ragged thing torn from her throat. “That’s you. The jailer. The ghost. The sickness that eats everything beautiful and calls it love.” She took a step toward the bed, grabbing the sketchbook and clutching it to her chest like a shield. “How dare you? How dare you go through my things, invade my mind, and then sit there and pretend you’ve done nothing wrong?”

“I was worried,” Tallulah replied, her tone one of deep, pained sincerity. She rose from the chair, a vision of wounded grace. “I felt you slipping away, hiding from me. I wanted to understand. And now I do. I see the world you’ve built in here.” She tapped her own temple. “A world where my love is a cage, where my worry is a prison. A world where I am a monster.” She took a step closer to Elara, her eyes glistening with manufactured tears. “Is it so monstrous to want to keep the only real thing in my life safe? You weren't happy in Berlin, Elara. You were performing. I brought you back to reality, to us. And this is my reward? To be turned into a gargoyle in your little book of hate?”

“This isn’t a book of hate!” Elara’s voice was escalating into a full-blown shout, the sound raw and shocking in the quiet apartment. “It’s a book of truth! The only truth left! You didn’t save me, you buried me! You talk about our world, our atmosphere, but it’s your world, your atmosphere, and I have been suffocating in it since the day I came back!” She backed away from Tallulah, her eyes darting around the room, at the walls that were closing in, the beds that were a tomb. Her gaze landed on the wardrobe. With a sudden, desperate movement, she threw the sketchbook onto the floor, lunged for the wardrobe, and wrenched the door open. She began pulling clothes out, her own and the few remaining pieces from Berlin, throwing them into the open suitcase on the floor. “I am leaving,” she gasped, her movements frantic, clumsy. “I am leaving right now. You can’t stop me. You can’t hold me here.”

The shouting had done its work. The bedroom door was pushed open, and Isabel and Javier stood there, their faces a mixture of confusion and alarm. They took in the scene in an instant: Elara, half-sobbing, frantically throwing clothes into a suitcase; the floor littered with her drawings; and Tallulah, standing perfectly still, her face a mask of pale, tear-streaked devastation. “What on earth is going on?” Javier demanded, his voice a stern rumble. Isabel rushed to Tallulah’s side. “Tally? My God, what happened? What did she do?”

Tallulah turned a look of pure, heartbreaking sorrow on her mother. “I just… I asked her what was wrong,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “I told her I was worried about her. And she just… exploded. She said I was a monster. That I was keeping her in a prison.” She gestured helplessly toward the open sketchbook on the floor, at the dark, violent images. Isabel glanced down, her eyes widening in horror at the grotesque depiction of her daughter. Elara froze, her hands full of a crumpled sweater, and stared at her father and his wife. She saw their faces change as they looked from the drawings to her, her face contorted with rage and desperation, and then to Tallulah, the picture of a gentle soul brutally attacked. She saw the judgment harden in their eyes. She was the madwoman in their attic. She was the problem. “That’s not what happened!” she cried, her voice cracking. “She’s lying! She’s twisting everything!”

“Elara, that is enough,” Javier said, his voice cold with a disappointment that was more painful than any anger. He stepped into the room and gently took the clothes from her hands. “You are not yourself. You are overwrought. You will not be going anywhere in this state.” He looked at the chaos on the floor, at Tallulah’s trembling form being cradled by Isabel, and his face was a mask of stern, paternal decision. “You will apologize to Tallulah for this… this terrible outburst. And then you will rest.” It was a command, not a suggestion. It was the final wall of the prison, snapping into place. Elara looked from her father’s unyielding face to Isabel’s condemning glare, and then to Tallulah, who was watching her from the safe harbor of her mother’s arms. Across the ruin of the room, Tallulah’s eyes met hers, and in their depths, there was not a trace of sorrow. There was only the calm, absolute, and eternal finality of victory. Elara’s shoulders slumped, the last of the fight, the last of the fire, extinguished by the cold tide of their united disbelief. The suitcase on the floor was no longer a vessel of escape. It was just an empty box in a room she would never leave.The room became a tableau of judgment. Javier, his face a mask of granite disappointment, picked up the scattered pages of the sketchbook as if they were pieces of evidence at a crime scene. He didn't look at them. He simply gathered them into a neat, damning pile and placed them on the desk, a problem to be dealt with later. Isabel continued to coo at Tallulah, stroking her hair, murmuring soothing reassurances, her back turned pointedly toward Elara, creating a physical barrier of accusation. Elara stood alone in the center of the room, her rebellion collapsed into a heap of discarded clothes at her feet. The energy that had fueled her frantic packing, her furious shouts, had vanished, leaving behind a hollow, ringing silence in her bones. She was no longer a participant in the scene, but an object within it, being observed and managed.

“It’s okay,” Tallulah whispered, her voice muffled against her mother’s shoulder, yet carrying perfectly across the room. “It’s okay, Mamá. She’s just not herself. She’s tired. She doesn’t mean it.” This act of magnanimous forgiveness was the final, most exquisite turn of the knife. It recast Elara’s valid rage as a temporary madness, a sickness from which she would surely recover, thanks to Tallulah’s endless patience. It absolved Tallulah of all wrongdoing and crowned her with the thorny halo of a martyr. Elara watched this performance, this masterful manipulation, and felt a coldness so profound it seemed to stop her heart. She was not in a fight with her lover. She was trapped in a web, and the spider was now pretending to comfort her. Without a word, she bent down, picked up the clothes from the floor, and began to fold them, her movements mechanical, detached. She placed them back in the wardrobe drawers, one by one. She was unpacking. She was home.

The days that followed were lived in a thick, sound-dampening fog of care. Elara was treated as a convalescent. Her parents spoke to her in gentle, simplified sentences, as one would to a child or a person recovering from a great shock. They monitored her food intake, celebrated when she finished a plate, and exchanged worried glances when she simply pushed the food around. Her father, in a clumsy attempt to help, confiscated the sketchbook. “You need to rest your mind, Lari,” he had said, his voice full of a gruff, misguided love. “No more of these dark thoughts for a while.” He had locked it away in his study, entombing her only outlet, her only truth, in a drawer full of old bills and forgotten paperwork.

Elara moved through the days like a phantom. She learned that resistance, even the silent resistance of a cold shoulder, was futile. It was merely diagnosed as another symptom of her "illness." The only way to find a sliver of peace was through absolute compliance. She became a flawless automaton. She sat where she was told to sit, walked where she was told to walk, and ate what she was given. She kept her eyes downcast, her expression neutral, her soul retreated to a place so deep inside herself that no one, not even Tallulah, could reach it. The art supplies on her side of the desk gathered a fine layer of dust. The girl who had seen the world in lines and shades had gone blind.

Tallulah, in her role as chief nurse, was a portrait of gentle constancy. She was always there, a soft, looming presence. She would read aloud to Elara from their favorite books of poetry, her voice weaving the familiar words of Lorca and Cernuda into the bars of their cage. She would sit on the edge of the bed in the morning and brush Elara’s hair, one hundred slow, methodical strokes, her touch no longer intimate, but proprietary. She was not tending to a lover; she was polishing a possession, maintaining the beautiful, silent object she had fought so hard to keep. And in her eyes, when she looked at Elara’s quiet, vacant face, there was a deep, placid satisfaction. She had fixed the flaw. She had restored the order. Her world was whole again.

One night, weeks after the failed escape, the apartment was deep in a settled quiet. Outside, the *orballu* fell, a persistent, whispering mist that slicked the slate roofs until they gleamed like polished obsidian. In their room, in their shared bed, Tallulah lay awake, listening to the soft, even rhythm of Elara’s breathing beside her. She turned her head on her pillow. Elara was on her back, her face pale in the faint moonlight filtering through the blinds, her eyes closed. She looked like a marble effigy on a tomb, beautiful and remote and utterly still. The chasm that had opened between them in the bed was gone, filled in with a silence that was no longer jagged, but smooth and deep as a frozen lake. Tallulah reached out a hand, slowly, tentatively, and laid it on Elara’s shoulder. There was no flinch. No recoil. No reaction at all. Elara’s body simply accepted the touch, a passive weight beneath her hand. The last ember of rebellion had finally gone cold.

A profound sense of peace settled over Tallulah, a quiet, humming contentment. This was not the fierce, desperate love she had once felt, but something calmer, more absolute. It was the feeling of a perfect, intricate diorama, finally complete. Every piece was in its place. Every figure was glued down, secured against the jarring possibility of movement or change. She let her hand rest on Elara’s shoulder, a gesture of ownership, of finality. She looked past the still form beside her, out the window, at the soft grey curtain of the mist drawing itself around the city. It was no longer a secret whispered from the sky, a private atmosphere for two. It was just the weather. The unchanging, ever-present climate of her world. A world that was once again perfect, quiet, and entirely her own.## Chapter 6

Autumn bled into Oviedo, replacing the soft, persistent mist with a sharper, colder rain that washed the last of the summer’s warmth from the cobblestones. The plane trees in the Campo de San Francisco turned a brittle, melancholic yellow, their leaves carpeting the paths where Tallulah and Elara now walked in the afternoons. These walks had become a ritual, a cornerstone of Elara’s prescribed recovery. Tallulah would lead, her pace measured, her hand sometimes resting lightly on the small of Elara’s back, a gesture that looked like affection but felt like guidance. They would stop at a vendor’s cart, the air sweet with the smell of roasting chestnuts, and Tallulah would buy a paper cone. "You see?" she’d said once, her voice bright, holding out the cone. "I told you you’d be back before the chestnuts were in season again." Elara had taken one, her fingers brushing against the warm, smooth shell, and had eaten it without a word, her expression unchanging. Tallulah had taken this as a victory, a promise fulfilled, a sign that the world had been set right. The silence that enveloped them on these walks was, to her, the silence of peace, the quiet hum of a machine restored to its proper, orderly function.

But the silence, once a living thing they had shared, began to change. It was no longer the full, breathable atmosphere of their private world; it was a vacuum. Tallulah found herself talking more, filling the empty space with observations about the weather, anecdotes from her reading, plans for their evening, her voice sounding unnaturally loud and thin against the backdrop of Elara’s profound quiet. Elara’s compliance, once a source of deep satisfaction, started to feel unnerving. She was a perfect mirror, reflecting whatever was asked of her but originating nothing. She would turn her head when Tallulah spoke, her eyes would follow Tallulah’s hand as it gestured, she would nod at the appropriate moments, but there was no friction, no resistance, no life. Tallulah would ask, "Shall we have tea?" and Elara would reply, "If you like." The absence of a will, the utter lack of preference, was more disquieting than any argument. Tallulah had won the war, but the territory she had conquered was a barren, lifeless moonscape.

The realization that her victory was hollow came upon her slowly, a creeping chill that the wool of her coat could not keep out. The Elara she had fought to bring home, the vibrant, passionate girl whose art had been a second, more honest language, was gone. In her place was this ghost, this placid shell. The quiet of their room at night was no longer intimate; it was funereal. Tallulah began to crave a reaction, any reaction, that was not born of her own prompting. She longed for a spark of the old defiance, a flash of irritation, even a genuine smile. One evening, she tried reading from Lorca, choosing a poem full of blood and moonlight and duende, her voice impassioned, trying to strike a chord, but Elara’s face remained a placid, uninterested mask. The words, once a sacred communion, now felt like a desperate, foolish incantation. Tallulah knew then that she had made a critical error. In extinguishing the rebellion, she had also extinguished the soul. The doll in her diorama was not just silent; it was broken.

A new plan, born not of anger but of a creeping, desperate panic, began to form. She needed to restart Elara’s heart, and she knew there was only one way to do it. Art was not just Elara’s language; it was her lifeblood. The next afternoon, Tallulah approached Javier. She found him in his study, staring out the window, a worried frown etched between his brows. “Papá,” she began, her voice soft and full of concern. “I think Elara is ready. I think it would be good for her to have her sketchbook back. Not as pressure, just… to have it. To know that we trust her. To know that part of her is still there, waiting.” Javier, eager for any sign of progress, any solution offered by the one person who seemed to understand his daughter, readily agreed. He unlocked the drawer and handed over the book of "dark thoughts" as if passing a pardoned prisoner into her keeper’s custody. Tallulah took it, its weight familiar in her hands, and carried it back to their room, a peace offering that was also a desperate experiment. She placed it on Elara’s bedside table, next to a neat row of newly sharpened pencils. “I thought you might want this,” she said, her voice carefully neutral. Elara looked at the book, then at Tallulah, and for the first time in weeks, a flicker of something unreadable passed through her eyes. Then she gave a small, slight nod, and said nothing.

For two days, the sketchbook sat untouched, a silent accusation on the bedside table. Tallulah did not mention it, though its presence electrified the room. She watched Elara from the corner of her eye, waiting. Then, on the third afternoon, while Tallulah was pretending to read, Elara picked it up. She sat not at her desk, but on the floor, her back against the bed. Tallulah held her breath. The only sound was the faint scratch of a pencil against paper. It was a sound Tallulah had once loved more than any music, the sound of Elara’s mind at work. Now, it was the sound of a desperate, high-stakes gamble. She did not dare look, did not dare move, for what felt like an hour. She waited, her heart pounding with a wild mix of hope and terror. She was desperate to see a flash of the old passion, the angry gargoyles, the tender portraits, anything that proved the girl she loved was still in there. Finally, the scratching stopped. Elara closed the book, stood up, and placed it on the small table between their beds. Then, she walked out of the room, leaving Tallulah alone with the verdict.

With a trembling hand, Tallulah reached for the sketchbook. She was afraid to open it, terrified of what she might find—or what she might not. She took a deep, steadying breath and lifted the cover. On the stark white page was a single drawing. It was the chestnut she had bought for Elara weeks ago. It was rendered with a technical perfection that stole Tallulah’s breath. Every nuance of the shell’s smooth, taut skin, the faint, fibrous texture of its pale scar, the subtle play of light and shadow on its curved surface—it was flawless. It was the most lifelike, most accurate, most exquisitely detailed drawing Elara had ever done. And it was utterly, terrifyingly dead. There was no love in the lines, no anger, no joy, no pain. It was not an artist’s rendering of a memory; it was a botanist’s illustration, a cold, clinical, and perfect documentation of a dead thing. It was a masterpiece of emptiness.

Tallulah stared at the drawing, and a cold dread, far deeper than any she had felt before, bloomed in her chest. This was not a surrender. This was not a cry for help. This was a statement of fact. It was a mirror held up to what she had done. Elara was showing her, with breathtaking and cruel precision, the result of her work. *You wanted me back,* the drawing screamed in its perfect silence. *You wanted me to be yours, to be here, to be whole. Here I am. I can perform the actions. I can render the image. But the soul you thought you were fighting for? You killed it. This empty, perfect thing is all that is left. This is your victory.* Tallulah slowly closed the book, but the image of the dead chestnut was burned onto the inside of her eyelids. The silence of the room was no longer peaceful, no longer empty. It was accusatory. She had won. She had Elara. But the person she had was a stranger, an exquisitely crafted automaton of her own making, and its perfect, silent obedience was a judgment she would have to live with forever.The silence of the room was no longer peaceful, no longer empty. It was accusatory. She had won. She had Elara. But the person she had was a stranger, an exquisitely crafted automaton of her own making, and its perfect, silent obedience was a judgment she would have to live with forever. The cold dread did not pass. It settled in her stomach like a stone, a permanent, indigestible knot of her own making. She looked at her own hands, the hands that had engineered this return, that had written the manipulative texts and orchestrated the emotional collapse of a family, and they seemed alien to her, the hands of a cold-hearted vandal who had broken something irreplaceable just to prove that she could.

When Elara returned to the room, she moved with the same fluid, lifeless grace she had adopted for weeks. She did not look at Tallulah, nor did she look at the sketchbook that now lay on the bed like a funeral wreath. She simply began her nightly routine, folding the clothes she had worn that day, laying out a fresh set for the morning. The sheer normalcy of the action, performed in the shadow of the monstrous truth that had just been revealed, was a form of madness. Tallulah could not bear it. Her voice, when it finally emerged, was a strained, thin thing.
“It’s very well drawn,” she said, her words dropping into the silence like pebbles into a deep, dark well. “The chestnut.”
Elara paused in the act of folding a sweater, her back to Tallulah. “Thank you,” she said. Her voice was perfectly level, polite, and as devoid of emotion as the drawing itself. There was no trace of sarcasm, no hint of the fury that had produced the images of the stitched mouth and the shadow creature. It was the voice of a pleasant, helpful stranger.
“Why did you draw it?” Tallulah pressed, her desperation making her voice sharp. She needed an explanation, an accusation, a fight—anything but this terrifying, placid void.
Elara turned, her face a serene, beautiful mask. She looked at Tallulah with eyes that registered her presence but held no connection. “You gave me the sketchbook,” she said, as if explaining a simple fact to a child. “You wanted me to draw. So I drew.” She then turned back to her task, the conversation, as far as she was concerned, concluded. The simplicity of the statement, the unassailable logic of it, was a door slammed and locked in Tallulah’s face.

The drawing of the chestnut was not the end. It was the beginning of a new, more subtle form of psychological warfare. Art, which had been forbidden, was now encouraged. Isabel, seeing Elara drawing again, praised it as a sign of her "coming back to herself." She would peer over Elara’s shoulder and marvel at the technical skill. Elara would accept the praise with a small, polite smile. She drew the rain-streaked window, capturing every droplet, every distortion of the glass, with breathtaking precision. She drew a wilted flower from a vase in the living room, each brown edge and curled petal rendered with the accuracy of a photograph. She drew the view of the cathedral spire from their window, a perfect architectural study devoid of all the love and mystery they had once projected onto it. Each drawing was a masterpiece of observation and a monument to emotional absence. Each perfect, dead thing was a new page in Tallulah’s indictment.

Tallulah’s carefully constructed world began to fray at the edges, and it was she who was now the one coming undone. The silence she had once cultivated as a sanctuary now hummed with a low, unbearable frequency of accusation. She found herself watching Elara constantly, searching for a crack in the facade, a flicker of the old anger, a ghost of the girl she had destroyed. She would try to provoke a reaction, bringing up memories of their past, of shared jokes, of stolen kisses. "Remember that cafe in the Fontán, how we hid in the corner for hours?" she’d ask, her voice laced with a desperate nostalgia. Elara would look at her, her head tilted in an attitude of polite listening. "Yes," she would say. "I remember. The coffee was very bitter there." The memory was acknowledged, confirmed, and stripped of all its magic in a single, clinical sentence. The past was no longer a shared continent; it was a series of data points that Elara could access and report on without feeling. The more Tallulah tried to re-enchant their world, the more Elara’s placid compliance disenchanted it, turning their most sacred moments into mundane anecdotes.The desperation began to curdle into a low-grade, constant panic. Tallulah, the architect of silences, now found them unbearable. She began to manufacture noise. She would play music in the apartment, loud, jarring songs that had no history for them, hoping to shock the air into life. She would instigate pointless arguments with her mother about politics or television shows, her voice sharp and brittle, simply to hear another human being express a genuine, unprompted opinion. During these strange, tense exchanges, Elara would sit nearby, placidly reading or staring into space, an island of unnerving calm in the storm Tallulah was trying to create. The dynamic in the apartment shifted. Isabel and Javier, who had once seen Tallulah as the stable, sensible one, now began to treat her with a new, worried caution. She was becoming volatile, unpredictable. Elara, by contrast, was a model of serene recovery. She was no trouble at all.

The breaking point came late one night. Rain, a real storm this time, lashed against the window, the same wide window that had been their stage for the night the power had first failed and their world had begun. The memory was so vivid, so potent, that Tallulah felt a surge of desperate hope. This was the setting. This was the catalyst. She could recreate the conditions, force a reaction. She turned to Elara, who was lying in bed, her eyes open and staring at the ceiling, a study in stillness. Tallulah’s heart hammered against her ribs. She moved across the small space, her own movements now hesitant, uncertain. She slid under the covers beside Elara, her body radiating a frantic, nervous heat. The mattress dipped, and Elara did not stir.

“Lari,” Tallulah whispered, her voice rough with a plea she could no longer hide. She reached out, her fingers tracing the line of Elara’s arm, from shoulder to wrist. The skin was cool, unresponsive. She leaned in, her lips finding Elara’s. The kiss was a ghost of all their past kisses. It was met not with rejection, but with something far worse: a soft, yielding passivity. Elara’s lips parted slightly under the pressure of her own, her body remained pliant, unresisting. It was like kissing a beautiful, lifelike doll. A wave of revulsion and self-loathing washed over Tallulah. This was not an act of love; it was a violation of a memory, a grotesque parody she was performing for herself. She pulled back abruptly, a strangled sob catching in her throat. Elara blinked slowly, her gaze calm and unfocused. “Is something wrong?” she asked, her voice a gentle, curious murmur.

That was the end. The polite, concerned question from the hollow shell of the girl she had loved was an act of cruelty so profound it shattered Tallulah’s last defenses. The carefully constructed persona of the calm, victorious guardian disintegrated, leaving only the raw, panicked desperation of a girl who had made a monstrous, irreversible mistake. Tears, hot and real, streamed down Tallulah’s face. She scrambled out of the bed, pacing the small space in front of the window, the storm outside a pale imitation of the one breaking inside her.
“Yes, something is wrong!” she cried, her voice cracking, hysterical. “Everything is wrong! You’re wrong! This is wrong!” She gestured wildly at Elara, at the room, at the whole suffocating world she had so carefully rebuilt. “Don’t you feel anything? I lied, Elara! Do you hear me? I lied about everything. The paperweight didn’t just fall. The noises in the night, the not eating—it was a performance! All of it! I lied to my mother, I lied to your father, I lied to you! I did it all to make you come back!” The confession tumbled out, ugly and desperate, a torrent of poison she had held in for months. She sank to her knees on the floor, her body wracked with sobs, her face buried in her hands. “I did it because I couldn’t live without you. And now… now I have you, and I’m more alone than I have ever been. Please,” she begged, looking up, her face a mess of tears and mascara. “Please, hate me. Scream at me. Hit me. Please, just be real again.”

Elara sat up in the bed. She looked down at the crumpled, sobbing figure of Tallulah on the floor. For a long, silent moment, she simply watched, her head tilted slightly, as if observing a curious and distant natural phenomenon. The storm raged outside. The confession, a desperate plea for absolution or damnation, hung in the air, waiting for judgment. Slowly, a change came over Elara’s face. It was not anger. It was not forgiveness. A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched the corners of her lips. It was a smile of immense, ancient, and weary sadness. It was the first genuine expression Tallulah had seen on her face in months, and it was the most terrifying thing she had ever witnessed.
“But why would I hate you, Tally?” Elara asked, her voice soft, gentle, and utterly devoid of hope. “You were right all along.” She swung her legs out of the bed, her bare feet silent on the floorboards. She knelt in front of Tallulah, not to comfort her, but to be on her level, to make sure her words were heard. “This is the only real thing,” she said, quoting the words Tallulah herself had spoken in this very room, in another lifetime. She gestured around at the walls, at the rain-streaked window. “Our world. You were its guardian. You kept it safe. You let nothing and no one else in.” Her eyes, for the first time, focused on Tallulah’s with a piercing, soul-deep clarity. They were not vacant. They were empty. The emptiness was a choice, a final, perfect defense. “You won,” Elara whispered, and the quiet finality of the words was a life sentence. She then reached out and, with the detached tenderness of a museum curator handling a fragile artifact, she brushed a tear from Tallulah’s cheek. Then she rose, went back to her side of the bed, and lay down, turning her back, her victory complete. Tallulah was left kneeling on the floor, her confession unheard, her plea unanswered, alone in the absolute, silent ruin of the world she had fought so desperately to possess.## Chapter 7

The storm outside exhausted itself, its fury dwindling to a weary drizzle, then to nothing. The silence it left behind was absolute, a thick, heavy blanket smothering the room. Tallulah remained kneeling on the floor, the rough texture of the rug pressing into her knees, a dull, distant pain. The torrent of her confession had emptied her, leaving behind a vast, cavernous hollow. She felt scoured, stripped down to nothing but the quivering, ugly core of her guilt. Across the room, Elara’s breathing was a slow, even metronome, a sound of infuriating peace that seemed to mock the wreckage of Tallulah’s soul. She had torn herself open, offered up her own rotten heart for judgment, and the judge had simply smiled, patted her on the head, and gone to sleep. There was no punishment, no absolution, no catharsis. There was only this dead, echoing quiet, and the sickening realization that her ultimate weapon—the truth—was as useless as all her lies had been.

Morning arrived not with a gentle dawn but as a slow, merciless leak of grey light into the room, revealing the stale air and the shadows of the night before. Tallulah had, at some point, crawled into her own bed, but she had not slept. She felt brittle, ancient, her body a fragile shell around the buzzing void inside her. She watched as Elara rose, her movements as fluid and unburdened as ever. She moved through the familiar morning rituals—stretching, dressing, brushing her hair—with a serene purposefulness. There was no trace of the night's drama on her face, no hint of anger or sorrow. It was as if Tallulah’s hysterical, floor-soaking breakdown had been a dream she’d had alone. When Elara was dressed, she glanced toward Tallulah, who was huddled under her duvet, her face pale and blotchy. A flicker of something, perhaps pity, crossed Elara’s face. “You should get some sleep,” she said, her voice soft. “You look exhausted.” The gentle, solicitous advice was a perfectly aimed dart, and it struck Tallulah with the force of a physical blow.

Breakfast was an ordeal of quiet dread. Javier and Isabel were waiting at the table, their usual morning bustle conspicuously absent. They did not look at Elara, who was calmly spreading tomato on her toast as if it were the most important task in the world. Their eyes, anxious and questioning, were fixed on Tallulah. “We heard… a commotion last night,” Isabel began, her voice tentative, her gaze searching Tallulah’s face for an explanation. “Is everything alright, Tally?” The script had been flipped. She was no longer the reliable narrator; she was the source of the disturbance, the problem to be solved. Tallulah looked at her mother, at the genuine worry in her eyes, and the words of her confession died in her throat. She couldn’t repeat them. She couldn’t expose the full, calculated horror of her actions to the two people she had so callously used. To do so would be to detonate the family completely. “I… I wasn’t feeling well,” she mumbled, her eyes dropping to the table. “I had a bad dream.” Across from her, Elara took a delicate bite of her toast, her expression one of placid neutrality. The lie was so feeble, so transparent, that the silence that followed was thick with disbelief. It was Elara who broke it. “She gets overwrought sometimes,” she said to her father, her tone a perfect echo of the condescending concern Tallulah had once used. “She worries too much.”

The days that followed established the new, horrific order. The roles were not just reversed; they were inverted, a photographic negative of what had been. Tallulah became the ghost, the one who drifted from room to room, her movements aimless, her eyes haunted. It was she who was now silent, lost in the labyrinth of her own guilt. Elara, in contrast, seemed to blossom into her emptiness. She initiated quiet, pointless conversations with Isabel about recipes. She helped Javier with the crossword puzzle, her mind sharp and clear. She was pleasant, she was helpful, she was perfectly, terrifyingly fine. Her serene compliance was no longer a sign of her imprisonment, but a constant, living monument to Tallulah’s failure. She was the picture of a well-adjusted young woman, while Tallulah, frayed and erratic, looked increasingly like the one who was unwell.

A desperate, frantic need to undo what she had done began to consume Tallulah. This cage she had so meticulously constructed had to be dismantled, or she would go mad within it. One afternoon, finding Elara sitting in the living room, sketching another of her perfectly dead still lifes—a glass of water this time, rendered with chilling precision—Tallulah made her move. She sat beside her, not on the sofa, but on the floor, a supplicant. “I’m serious, Lari,” she said, her voice low and urgent. “You should go back. To Berlin.” She held out her laptop, the screen displaying flight options, a list of brightly coloured logos offering escape. “I’ll tell them the truth. All of it. I’ll take all the blame. You can be free. I want you to be free.” This, she thought, was the one pure, selfless act she had left in her. An offering of truth, an act of penance.

Elara looked up from her drawing, her eyes calm. She glanced at the screen, at the list of flights, her expression unreadable. Then she looked back at Tallulah, kneeling on the floor before her. A faint, sad smile touched her lips, the same smile from the night of the confession, a smile that held the wisdom of a dead star. She reached out, not to take the laptop, but to gently close its lid, shutting down the possibilities within. “But I don’t want to go back to Berlin,” she said, her voice as soft and reasonable as ever. “I’m not that person anymore. You taught me that.” She picked up her pencil and gestured with it, a professor indicating a key point in a lecture. “My life is here. With you. In the world you kept safe for me.” She looked around the living room, at the familiar furniture, the familiar walls, as if it were a paradise she had finally learned to appreciate. “Why would I ever want to leave?” she asked, her voice full of a gentle, unassailable logic. "We're home." The words, once the goal of all her desperate scheming, were now the four walls of her own eternal prison, and she saw in Elara’s clear, empty eyes that they both knew it.The closing of the laptop was the softest, most violent sound Tallulah had ever heard. It was the sound of a door being sealed not with a lock, but with logic. Elara’s calm, pitying smile was a work of art far more devastating than any of her hate-filled drawings. It was a mirror reflecting the twisted, monstrous shape of Tallulah’s own soul, and it offered no possibility of being shattered. Tallulah remained on the floor, the heavy, useless weight of the laptop in her lap, feeling the last vestiges of her frantic hope drain away, replaced by the slow, cold tide of a permanent and unchangeable reality. Her confession had not freed her; it had simply provided Elara with the final, perfect stone to seal the entrance to her tomb.

In the days that followed, the apartment became a meticulously managed sanatorium, and Tallulah was its sole, increasingly frantic patient. The need to smash something, to scream, to shatter the placid, suffocating surface of their new life, became an urgent, physical craving. She began leaving doors open, dropping books, hoping the sharp, sudden noise would startle a genuine reaction out of Elara, but it never did. Elara would simply pick up the book with a gentle sigh or close the door with a quiet click, her face a mask of serene tolerance for Tallulah’s growing clumsiness. The more Tallulah flailed against the invisible walls of her prison, the more the bars, forged of loving concern, seemed to thicken around her.

One grey Thursday afternoon, the desperation finally overwhelmed her. She went into their room and, in a frantic, feverish imitation of Elara’s own failed escape, she pulled her own bag from the wardrobe. Her hands shook as she pulled clothes from drawers, her movements clumsy and without purpose. She wasn’t packing to go anywhere; she was simply performing the act of leaving, a desperate ritual to prove to herself that she still could. Tears streamed down her face, tears of pure, impotent rage at the calm, silent figure who sat at the desk, sketching the fall of light on a water glass, refusing to acknowledge the drama unfolding behind her. Elara did not turn. She did not speak. She simply continued to draw, the scratch of her pencil a steady, infuriating counterpoint to Tallulah’s ragged sobs. After a moment, she placed her pencil down with careful precision, rose from her chair, and glided silently out of the room.

Tallulah didn’t notice she was gone until the voices appeared in the doorway. It was Isabel and Javier, their faces etched with a deep, loving alarm. Behind them, a step back in the shadows of the hall, stood Elara, her expression one of profound, helpless sorrow. It was a perfect tableau of a family in crisis. “Tally, mi vida, what is this?” Isabel asked, her voice trembling as she took in the chaotic pile of clothes, the open bag, the sight of her daughter weeping on the floor. She rushed to Tallulah’s side, trying to gather her into an embrace. Tallulah flinched away, pointing a trembling finger at the calm figure in the doorway. “Her! It’s her! She won’t let me go! Can’t you see what she’s doing?” she cried, her voice a raw, unhinged shriek. Javier stepped forward, his face stern with paternal worry. “Tallulah, calm yourself. Nobody is stopping you from doing anything. Elara came to us. She was worried about you.” He looked at his own daughter, who nodded sadly. “She said you were having another bad turn. That you weren’t making sense.”

The trap was complete. Her own frantic bid for freedom had been expertly reframed as a symptom of her instability. She was the hysteric, the madwoman, her words nothing more than the babbling of a troubled mind. They saw her not as a prisoner crying for help, but as a patient in the throes of a terrible delusion. With gentle, irresistible force, her mother and Javier guided her to the bed, their soothing words a suffocating blanket of misunderstanding. They unpacked her bag, their movements full of a sad, pitying love, folding her clothes and putting them away as if tidying a nursery. Through it all, Elara watched from the doorway, her hands clasped before her, the picture of a heartbroken, supportive sister. Finally, when Tallulah was limp with exhaustion and defeat, tucked under the covers of her own bed, Elara approached. She was carrying a cup of chamomile tea. “Here,” she whispered, her voice a caress. “Drink this. It will help you rest.” She placed the warm cup in Tallulah’s hands, her fingers brushing against Tallulah’s, cool and dry. The gesture, a perfect mimicry of the care Tallulah had once lavished on her, was the final, elegant checkmate. Tallulah looked from the cup in her hands to Elara’s face, and in the clear, empty depths of her eyes, she saw her own reflection, a wild, trapped thing, staring back.The cup of tea was an anchor, dragging her down into the cold, silent depths of her new reality. Its warmth was a mockery, a counterfeit comfort in her trembling hands. She looked at Elara, at the placid mask of concern that was now her permanent face, and saw the full, horrifying scope of her defeat. Her own weapons—care, concern, the performance of love—had been seized and were now being used against her with a mastery that bordered on genius. Elara had not just survived the prison Tallulah had built; she had learned its architecture, seized control of its mechanisms, and locked its creator inside. To fight, to scream, to refuse the tea, would only prove her captor’s diagnosis of her instability. With a shudder that wracked her entire body, Tallulah raised the cup to her lips and drank. The sweet, cloying taste of chamomile was the taste of surrender, of a poison she had brewed for another and was now forced to drink herself.

The apartment shrank. Its bright, modern walls, which had once felt so sterile and foreign, now closed in, the sterile white a perfect backdrop for the clinical observation she was under. The loving, anxious gazes of her mother and Javier became the unwavering eyes of wardens. They monitored her, their conversations about her conducted in stage whispers just outside her door, loud enough for the key phrases to drift in like toxins. “She needs her rest.” “So sensitive.” “It’s good that Elara is so strong for her now.” Elara, the ghost, was now the pillar. She would bring Tallulah trays of food that Tallulah could not eat, her stomach a tight, acid-filled knot. She would sit by Tallulah’s bed and offer to read aloud from books that Tallulah could no longer focus on, the words swimming before her eyes like meaningless black insects. Every gentle gesture was a tightening of the screw, a reinforcement of the narrative that Tallulah was fragile, broken, and in desperate need of the calm, steadying influence of the very person she had broken.

The ritual walks through the Casco Antiguo became a form of torture. The city, once her accomplice and confidante, was now a hostile witness to her damnation. The ancient stones of the cathedral, which had once seemed to whisper secrets of endurance and love, now loomed over her with the stony indifference of a courthouse. Their gargoyles were no longer quirky companions but leering, grotesque caricatures of her own monstrous soul. The sound of the cider being poured on Calle Gascona, once a riotous celebration of life, now seemed harsh and grating. The *orballu*, the soft mist she had loved with a religious fervor, no longer felt like a private atmosphere, but like a damp, suffocating cloth pressed against her face, blurring her vision and chilling her to the bone. She was a ghost in her own favorite memories, and the city itself seemed to recoil from her, its familiar streets a labyrinth designed to lead her endlessly back to her own guilt.

One night, unable to bear the humming silence of the room, Tallulah found herself drawn to Elara’s desk. The new sketchbook lay there. A morbid, self-flagellating curiosity compelled her to open it. She expected to find more dead objects, more perfect, soulless still lifes. The page she turned to was worse. It was a portrait of her, Tallulah, asleep. Elara must have drawn it in the dead of night, watching her. The technical skill was breathtaking. Every strand of her dark hair spilling across the pillow, the subtle tension in her jaw even in sleep, the slight frown between her brows—it was all there, rendered with a chilling, clinical precision. But there was no love in the lines, no tenderness. It was not the drawing of a lover watching her beloved. It was the drawing of a biologist observing a specimen. It was an act of documentation, a cataloging of the creature that shared her cage. Tallulah felt a cold dread wash over her. Elara was not just a passive victim; she was an active observer, the cool, detached chronicler of Tallulah’s slow, agonizing descent.

In a final, desperate gambit, Tallulah tried to appeal to the only power she had left: her mother's love. She waited until they were alone, her voice a low, urgent plea. “Mamá, you have to listen to me. What I said the other night…it was the truth. I made it up. The illness, the sadness…it was all an act to get Elara to come home. I manipulated you. I manipulated everyone. I’m the one who is sick, but not in the way you think.” She watched her mother’s face, praying for a flicker of understanding, a dawning of the horrible truth. But Isabel’s expression only softened into one of deep, profound pity. She reached out and smoothed Tallulah’s hair, her touch gentle and dismissive. “Oh, Tally. My poor, sweet girl,” she murmured, her voice thick with a love that was now a cage. “Don’t say such things. You’re confused. You’re blaming yourself for things that aren’t your fault. This illness…it makes the mind play such cruel tricks. We’re going to get you help. I’ve already made a call. A very good doctor. He’s going to help you get well again.” The words, meant as a promise of salvation, were the sound of the final lock turning, the final nail being hammered into the lid of her coffin.

The weeks bled into a gray, featureless expanse of time. The doctor came, a kind, tired-looking man who asked gentle questions that Tallulah could not answer, her truth now officially classified as a symptom of her delusion. He prescribed medication that she took without protest, the small white pills a daily communion with her own defeat. The frantic energy, the desperate need to fight, drained out of her, leaving a vast, quiet emptiness. She began to understand the terrible, seductive peace of Elara’s strategy. To fight was to be mad. To struggle was to be sick. The only way to survive, the only way to endure the unendurable, was to stop. To become still. To accept. To become a perfect, beautiful, hollow thing.

One afternoon, in the dead of winter, she was sitting in the armchair in their room. The light was pale and thin. Elara was at her desk, sketching. The only sound was the faint whisper of her pencil on the paper. Tallulah picked up a book, the worn volume of Lorca, and opened it to a random page. She did not read the words. She simply held the book, her posture calm, her hands steady. A kind of peace, the desolate peace of a battlefield after the last soldier has fallen, settled over her. She was no longer a prisoner rattling the bars. She had become a part of the prison itself, as silent and enduring as the stones. Without looking up from her drawing, Elara spoke, her voice a soft, quiet murmur that was not meant for anyone else, a thought given breath. “The light is better today,” she said. “It’s clearer.” Tallulah turned a page in her book, the crisp sound of the paper unnaturally loud in the profound quiet. “Yes,” she replied, her own voice calm and even, a perfect echo of Elara’s own empty serenity. “It is.” They sat there together in the pale winter light, two exquisite, hollow statues in a shared, silent tomb, their terrible, perfect world finally, and forever, at peace.The change was not a truce, but a new and more profound silence that settled over the apartment like a layer of fine, undisturbed dust. Winter arrived in Oviedo with a vindictive chill, glazing the cobblestones with treacherous black ice and stripping the last defiant leaves from the trees. The city huddled under a low, iron-grey sky, but inside the fourth-floor flat, the climate was stable, controlled, and unchanging. The frantic storms and emotional upheavals were a thing of the past. Isabel and Javier, after weeks of walking on eggshells, finally exhaled. They saw two daughters who were quiet, who took meals together, who walked in the park without incident. They saw Elara, strong and serene, a pillar of quiet support, and they saw Tallulah, her frantic energy finally calmed by rest and medication, making what they called "wonderful progress." They mistook the stillness of a graveyard for the peace of a garden.

The routine was immutable, its rhythms as predictable as the tolling of the cathedral bells. In the mornings, they would breakfast in near silence, the only sounds the clink of spoons against ceramic and the rustle of Javier’s newspaper. In the afternoons, if the weather permitted, they would walk. They no longer held hands, but moved in a strange, unconscious sync, their steps falling together on the pavement, two figures in dark coats moving through the grey city like a pair of solemn monks. They were a single entity again, but one animated by a shared emptiness rather than a shared soul. Tallulah, her mind smoothed and quieted by the small white pills she took without question, observed her own movements with a detached curiosity. She would watch her hand lift a cup of coffee to her lips and feel a distant surprise at the action, as if she were a puppeteer watching a marionette she had forgotten she was controlling.

Elara’s art continued, but its subject had changed. The dead, perfect objects were replaced by a new still life: Tallulah herself. She would sit for hours, her pencil whispering across the paper, capturing Tallulah in her newfound stillness. She drew Tallulah staring out the rain-streaked window, her profile as clean and cold as a cameo carved from ice. She drew Tallulah’s hands resting on an open, unread book, the fingers long and inert, rendered with a dispassionate, anatomical precision. These drawings were no longer a secret indictment. They were a public record, often left out on the desk for Isabel or Javier to see. They would marvel at the likeness, at the skill. "You've captured her so well, Lari," Isabel would say, her voice full of pride. "She looks so peaceful." They did not see that the peace Elara had captured was the profound, unsettling peace of a specimen preserved in formaldehyde, its every detail perfectly visible, its life entirely extinguished.

Sometimes, a flicker of the old world would attempt to breach the perimeter. An old university friend, Clara, called for Tallulah one evening. Elara answered the phone in the hallway, her body positioned to block the doorway to the living room where Tallulah was sitting. Her voice was a masterpiece of gentle, loving concern. “Clara, hi… She’s resting at the moment… It’s been a very difficult few months, as you can imagine… No, nothing specific, just a lot of exhaustion. She needs to keep things very quiet for now… Of course, I’ll tell her you called. She’ll be so happy to know you’re thinking of her.” She hung up, and when she returned to the room, she looked at Tallulah with a soft, sympathetic smile. "That was Clara," she said. "She sends her love." The message was delivered, the outside world acknowledged and neatly neutralized. The gates of the fortress remained closed, but now Elara was the one standing guard, protecting Tallulah from the exhausting demands of a life she was no longer equipped to live.

The medication had sanded down the sharp edges of Tallulah’s grief and guilt, leaving a smooth, barren landscape. The constant, buzzing panic was gone, replaced by a vast, quiet apathy. One afternoon, sitting in her armchair, she watched Elara drawing her and felt a phantom sensation, a ghost of an emotion. It was a memory of their first winter together, of laughing so hard at some shared, secret joke that they had to clutch their sides, their breath clouding in the cold air. The memory played in her mind like a silent film, a scene featuring two strangers she vaguely recognized. She felt no longing, no sadness, only a distant, academic understanding that this scene had once been associated with a feeling called happiness. The feeling itself was inaccessible, a word in a language she no longer spoke. She looked at her hands, resting on the arms of the chair, and then at Elara’s hand, the one holding the pencil, moving with such calm, certain purpose. She saw them not as her hand and Elara’s hand, but as two separate objects in a quiet room, one still and one in motion, both equally part of the same silent, unchanging composition. It was, in its own way, a kind of peace. The struggle was over. She had ceased to exist in any meaningful way, and in doing so, she had finally stopped being a problem.## Chapter 8

Spring arrived in Oviedo not as a gentle promise but as a sudden, almost violent assertion of life. The iron-grey skies of winter cracked open, admitting a pale, watery sunlight that grew stronger by the day. The magnolias in the Plaza de la Catedral burst into creamy, fragrant blossoms, and the outdoor tables of the cafes on Calle Uria filled with people blinking in the unexpected brightness, their voices a cheerful, rising tide. The city was throwing off its grey shroud, breathing deeply, and coming alive. Inside the fourth-floor apartment, however, the climate remained unchanged: cool, still, and perfectly regulated. The new sunlight that slanted through the wide windows did not warm the rooms; it merely illuminated the fine layer of dust that had settled on the surface of their lives, making the silence and the stillness all the more visible.

Elara had become the undisputed master of this silent world. Her serenity, once a weapon, was now a state of being. She managed the household with a quiet, unnerving efficiency. She was the one who remembered grocery lists, paid the bills online for Javier, and mediated the low-level anxieties that still occasionally flared between Isabel and the quiet, medicated ghost of her daughter. She had won the war so completely that she had become the reigning monarch of a kingdom of three, its borders the walls of the apartment, its national anthem the soft, steady scratch of her pencil on paper. Her victory was absolute. And it was beginning to suffocate her.

The realization came not as a sudden epiphany, but as a slow, creeping erosion of her hard-won peace. The flawless technical perfection of her art, which had once been a source of cold, righteous satisfaction, now felt like a cage for her hand. Each perfect, dead drawing was another bar. She had documented Tallulah’s descent into emptiness with the precision of a court reporter, but now that the subject was still, the work felt finished, and deeply, frighteningly pointless. The passion, the rage, the pain that had fueled her secret sketchbook in the beginning—all of it was gone, replaced by a skill that felt hollowed out, a beautiful, useless shell. She had proven her point so thoroughly that she had forgotten what the point was.

One bright April afternoon, needing a specific shade of graphite she didn’t own, Elara went out alone. It was a rare solo excursion. Usually, her walks were tethered to Tallulah, a slow, monitored orbit. To walk through the city by herself felt strange, like testing a limb that had long been asleep. The streets were vibrant, noisy with life. She passed a group of students arguing passionately in front of the university, their gestures wide, their faces alive with conviction. She saw a young couple kiss, a spontaneous, unthinking embrace in the middle of the crowded sidewalk. At the corner of her eye, she saw a piece of brightly-coloured spray paint on a wall, a tag that reminded her, with a sudden, sharp pang, of the graffiti-covered expanse of the East Side Gallery. A life that had been hers. A life of possibility, of colour, of noise. The memory was not of a place or a time, but of a feeling: the feeling of being a person moving forward, a person with a future that was not yet written. The pang of loss was so acute, so real, it was like a physical blow, stealing the air from her lungs.

She bought her pencils at the art supply shop, her transaction a brief, anonymous exchange, and then, instead of heading straight home, she found herself walking to a small park overlooking the new part of the city. She sat on a bench and opened her current sketchbook, the one filled with the cold, perfect renderings of their domestic prison. She turned to a blank page. She wanted to draw the face of the street musician she’d seen near the Berlin Cathedral, a man with a weathered face and eyes that held a universe of stories. She put the pencil to the paper, her mind full of the image. But her hand would not obey. The lines that emerged were hesitant, weak. She, who could capture the precise curve of a teacup with flawless accuracy, could not summon the life of a remembered face. The muscle memory of her art was now tuned only to the dead reality in front of her, not the living world inside her. She had spent so long meticulously documenting the emptiness of her cage that she had forgotten how to draw the sky. A cold, terrifying panic seized her. She had not just sacrificed her future; she had sacrificed her gift. In hollowing out Tallulah, she had hollowed out the one part of herself that had ever truly mattered.

She returned to the apartment, her serene mask firmly back in place, but inside, a new and desperate chaos was beginning to churn. She looked at Tallulah, who was sitting in her customary armchair, her gaze fixed on the middle distance, her hands placid in her lap. For months, Elara had seen this figure as the embodiment of her victory, a monument to a battle hard-won. Now, for the first time, she saw something else. She saw a mirror. She saw her own emptiness, her own hollowed-out soul, given flesh and form. The perfect, silent automaton was her creation, yes, but it was also her reflection. They were two ghosts haunting the same mausoleum. That night, as she lay in bed listening to Tallulah’s medicated, even breathing, she was consumed by a new, frantic urge: not to punish, not to win, but to see if there was anything, anything at all, left of the person she had so systematically destroyed. It was no longer a question of victory or defeat. It was a question of survival. She could not live forever in a tomb with a ghost, even if she was the one who had dug the grave.

Her rebellion, when it came, was a small, quiet, almost imperceptible act. Late that night, after her parents were asleep, she crept into the kitchen. The small, amber-coloured bottle of pills, Tallulah's "medication," sat on the counter where Isabel had left it. With a hand that trembled slightly, Elara unscrewed the cap. She shook two of the small white pills into her palm. Then, instead of placing them in the little dish for Tallulah’s morning dose, she walked to the sink, opened her hand, and let the pills fall. They made a sound no louder than a grain of sand dropping as they disappeared down the drain. She turned on the tap, and a quiet rush of water washed away the evidence. It was not an act of kindness, not yet. It was an act of desperate, reckless curiosity. It was an experiment. She wanted to see if she could wake the dead.## Chapter 9

The morning after the first act of sabotage was excruciating. Elara felt like a saboteur who had lit a fuse and was now forced to sit beside the bomb, pretending to admire the wallpaper. She watched with a tightness in her chest as Tallulah, guided by Isabel’s gentle prompt, came to the kitchen counter. Elara’s heart hammered as Tallulah picked up the little dish, which now held only water and a single vitamin. She swallowed without comment, her movements as placid and automatic as always. Nothing happened. The day unfolded in the same pale, quiet tones as all the days before. Tallulah sat in her armchair, a statue with a book in her lap. She ate the portion of lunch set before her. She walked beside Elara in the park, her gaze distant, her steps even. By nightfall, a strange mix of disappointment and profound relief washed over Elara. The experiment had failed. The ghost had not stirred.

But the seed of reckless curiosity, once planted, refused to die. That night, she repeated the ritual. The two small pills dropped into the sink, followed by the quiet rush of water that sounded to Elara like a roar in the silent apartment. It became her new secret, a nightly act of desperate alchemy. She lived a strange double life: by day, she was the serene, capable guardian of her family’s fragile peace, praised by her parents for her strength and patience. By night, she was a nervous scientist in a clandestine laboratory, her experiment’s unwilling subject sleeping just feet away from her. She became a feverish observer, studying Tallulah’s face for the slightest variation, the most minute flicker of change. She was looking for a crack in the perfect, placid surface she herself had so painstakingly created.

For days, there was nothing. The emptiness in Tallulah’s eyes seemed absolute, a permanent state of being. The medication, it seemed, had done its work so thoroughly that a few missed doses were meaningless. Elara began to despair, to believe that the damage was irreversible, that she was trapped forever with this beautiful, hollow shell. Then, on the fifth day, it happened. They were in the living room. The afternoon sun, bright and sharp, streamed through the window, illuminating a column of dust motes dancing in the air near the armchair where Tallulah sat. Elara, watching from the sofa, saw Tallulah’s gaze, usually fixed on a point somewhere beyond the walls of the room, drift and then focus. A slight frown, a tiny V of concentration, appeared between her brows. Her eyes, for a full thirty seconds, were not vacant. They were tracking the chaotic, glittering dance of the dust. It was the first unprompted, purely observant action Elara had seen in months. It was a sign of a mind re-engaging with the sensory world, a flicker of curiosity in the vast desert of her apathy. To Elara, it was as dramatic and hopeful as a flare fired from a shipwreck.

Emboldened, she continued her nightly sabotage with a renewed, almost frantic sense of purpose. The risk felt sharper now, the potential consequences more real. Another week passed. The changes were subtle, almost imperceptible to anyone who was not watching with Elara’s desperate intensity. A moment where Tallulah would pause before answering a question, as if searching for a real thought instead of a pre-programmed response. A newfound restlessness in her sleep, a soft sigh or a murmur that broke the steady, medicated rhythm. To Isabel and Javier, these were non-events. To Elara, they were seismic tremors, signs of a deep, tectonic shift happening far beneath the surface.

The first audible crack appeared on one of their afternoon walks. They were tracing their old, melancholy circuit through the Casco Antiguo. As they approached the Plaza de la Foncalada, the site of so many of their ghosts, Elara’s steps instinctively faltered, bracing for the usual wave of bad memories. They had walked past this fountain dozens of times in a dull, silent trance. But today, Tallulah stopped. She did not look at Elara, nor did she seem lost in a memory of their first kiss. Instead, she turned and looked at the small, modern bronze plaque affixed to the wall beside the ancient fountain, a plaque detailing its pre-Romanesque origins. Her lips moved, almost imperceptibly, as her eyes scanned the text. She was reading. She was processing information.

Then she turned. Her gaze, for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, was not a vacant stare or a reflection of Elara’s own expression. It was clouded, deeply confused, but it was her own. She was looking at Elara, truly seeing her, as a separate entity in the world. "The rain," Tallulah said. Her voice was a strange, disused thing, a dry, hesitant croak. "Has it rained this week?" The question was so startlingly simple, so profoundly normal. It was not a plea, not an accusation. It was a basic inquiry about the world, an acknowledgment of the passage of time, of weather, of a reality that existed outside the fog of her own mind. It was the question of a person trying to place herself back in the flow of the world.

Elara felt the air leave her lungs. She could not speak. The simple question was a key turning in a lock she thought had been rusted shut forever. This was it. The spark. The undeniable proof of life. A wild, terrifying joy ripped through her, a feeling so intense it was almost painful. It was followed immediately by a wave of ice-cold dread that started in her stomach and spread to her fingertips. She had done it. She had coaxed a response from the depths. The ghost was stirring, trying to find its bearings, and she knew with a sickening, absolute certainty that once it remembered where it was, it would begin to ask other, far more dangerous questions. She had opened Pandora’s box, driven by a selfish need to assuage her own desolation, and she had no idea what would emerge: the girl she had once loved, the monster who had tried to cage her, or a new, terrifying combination of both. She finally found her voice, the single word feeling momentous, pivotal, the first line in a new and unpredictable chapter. "No," she whispered. "No, Tally. It's been sunny all week."The simple answer hung in the air between them, a statement of fact that felt to Tallulah like a profound and confusing lie. Sunny. Her mind, a murky, silted riverbed for months, felt a strange, weak current stir. She had a distinct, internal sense of grey, a feeling of persistent mist that had been her entire reality. To be told that the world outside had been bright and clear was to be told that her own senses, her very perception of existence, were wrong. She looked up from the fountain, her gaze drifting toward a patch of blue sky visible between the old stone buildings. The light was sharp. It hurt her eyes. The confusion on her face was so naked, so unguarded, that Elara had to look away, a spike of guilt piercing her. This was the first cost of her experiment: the terror of a mind realizing it has been adrift, untethered from reality.

The walk home was a tightrope act. For the first time in months, Elara was not leading a placid ghost; she was escorting a waking amnesiac. Every step was fraught with a new tension. Tallulah’s head was no longer bowed in apathetic submission. It was up, turning slowly from side to side, her eyes taking in the city with a slow, dawning bewilderment. She noticed the bright green awnings of a new cafe, the startling yellow of daffodils planted in a window box, the way the sunlight caught the golden lettering on a street sign. Each observation was a small, silent shock. Elara walked beside her, her hands clenched into fists in her pockets, her entire body rigid with the effort of appearing calm. She wanted to grab Tallulah’s arm and hurry her back to the safety of the apartment, back to the controlled environment where this fragile, unpredictable re-emergence could be managed. But she knew that any sudden movement, any sign of her own panic, would frighten the timid, emerging consciousness she was so desperately trying to coax into the open.

When they entered the flat, Isabel was in the kitchen, humming. She turned, her face breaking into the practiced, gentle smile she now reserved for Tallulah. “There you are! How was the park? Tally, you look a little flushed. Did you get too much sun?” Before Tallulah could formulate a response, Elara stepped forward, her movements smooth and easy. “The light was just very bright today. It’s a bit overwhelming after all the grey weather we’ve had.” The lie was effortless, a small, quick stitch to mend a potential tear in the fabric of their peace. She guided Tallulah to the armchair, the familiar throne of her stillness, and went to get her a glass of water. Tallulah sat, but she did not sink into her usual catatonia. Her eyes followed Elara. They followed her mother. The placid emptiness was gone, replaced by a deep, searching watchfulness. She was a stranger in her own home, and she was beginning to realize it.

That night, lying in the dark, the fog in Tallulah’s mind began to recede not in a gentle tide, but in jagged, painful shards. Memories, stripped of their emotional context, floated to the surface like debris from a wreck. She remembered kneeling on the floor, the rough texture of the rug against her skin. She remembered the taste of salt, the feeling of a throat raw from screaming. She remembered a doctor’s kind, tired face. She remembered the sight of Elara, standing in the doorway, her face a mask of pity. The memories were vivid but disconnected, like scenes from a film she had watched in a fever. They didn’t feel like her own. Her own life, the life of the last few months, was a grey, featureless landscape of quiet rooms and slow walks. How could both be true? The contradiction was a physical weight in her chest, a low, humming panic that the pills had suppressed for so long. She turned her head on the pillow and looked at the still, sleeping form of Elara beside her. The trust she had once had, the absolute certainty that this person was an extension of her own self, was gone. In its place was a terrifying, unnameable suspicion. She was sleeping next to a stranger, a stranger who held the key to the missing pieces of her mind.

Elara, for her part, was also lying awake, her feigned sleep a thin veil over a churning sea of anxiety. She had felt Tallulah’s gaze on her, a probing, conscious presence in the dark that was a world away from the placid emptiness she had grown accustomed to. The experiment was working, but the results were terrifying. It was one thing to want to reanimate a ghost; it was another to be faced with the slow, unpredictable resurrection of a person she had profoundly wronged, a person who had also profoundly wronged her. The balance of power, which she had held so absolutely for months, was beginning to shift. She was no longer just the victor; she was the saboteur, the secret-keeper, the liar. She slipped out of bed, her feet silent on the floorboards, and went to the kitchen. The amber bottle of pills on the counter seemed to glow with a malevolent light. She picked it up, her hand shaking. For a moment, she was tempted to stop, to put the pills back in the dish, to let the fog descend once more and return to the dead, predictable safety she had created. But the image of Tallulah’s confused, searching eyes at the fountain stopped her. To go back now would be an act of cowardice, a condemnation of them both to the silent tomb. With a deep, shuddering breath, she unscrewed the cap. This was no longer just an experiment. It was a reckoning, and she had to see it through to its bitter, unknown end. She let the pills fall, and the quiet rush of water washing them away was the sound of her own last bridge being burned.## Chapter 10

The following days were a high-wire act of deception performed over a gaping chasm of truth. Elara felt a constant, low-level hum of adrenaline in her veins, the feeling of a fugitive perpetually on the verge of being discovered. Every morning was a new test of her nerve as she performed the ritual at the sink, her heart pounding with the fear that this would be the day Isabel or Javier would walk in. She lived in a state of hyper-vigilance, minutely observing Tallulah for signs of re-emergence, her own mind a frantic calculus of risk and reward. Each flicker of awareness in Tallulah’s eyes was both a terrifying success and a harbinger of the coming storm. The ghost was taking on flesh, and Elara, its reluctant necromancer, was beginning to fear the creation she was calling back from the abyss.

Tallulah’s mind, meanwhile, was a fog-bound coastline where the land was slowly, painfully reappearing. The confusion was the first solid thing she could hold onto. It was a starting point. She began to conduct her own quiet experiments. At breakfast, she would ask a question, her voice carefully neutral. “Mamá, what was the name of the doctor you called for me? I seem to have forgotten.” She watched as her mother frowned, trying to recall, but before Isabel could answer, Elara’s voice would slice smoothly into the conversation. “Dr. Merino. But don’t worry about that now, Tally. Just focus on feeling better.” Elara would then skillfully pivot the conversation to the weather or the day’s headlines, a deft redirection that left Isabel relieved and Tallulah with another piece of the puzzle: Elara was the gatekeeper of information. She was being managed. The realization did not bring anger, not yet. It brought a cold, sharp-edged clarity.

The memories began to return not as chaotic shards, but as whole, coherent scenes, each one more damning than the last. One afternoon, while staring at her own reflection in the dark glass of the oven, she remembered kneeling on the floor of their bedroom, the raw feeling in her throat, the desperate, ugly words of her confession pouring out of her. She remembered Elara’s face, the faint, sad, and terrifyingly final smile. *You won.* The memory hit her with such force that she had to grip the counter to steady herself. It was not a dream. It had happened. And everything that came after—the doctor, the pills, the gentle, suffocating care, the long grey fog—was a direct consequence of that moment. She had offered Elara the truth, a desperate plea for absolution or punishment, and Elara had chosen a third, more terrible path. She had chosen to erase her.

With that memory as her anchor, the rest of the timeline began to lock into place. She understood, with a certainty that chilled her to her core, what Elara had done. The slow, creeping clarity of the past week was not a miracle. It was an intervention. The nightly ritual of the pills, the little dish by the sink—it was the central gear in the machine of her erasure. She began to watch Elara with a new, terrifyingly lucid focus. She was no longer a confused patient; she was a detective, re-examining every gesture, every word, every soft, concerned smile for what it truly was: a masterful act of control. She saw the tension in Elara’s shoulders, the slight tremor in her hand as she poured coffee, the way her eyes darted to Tallulah’s face whenever she spoke. It was not the calm of a serene caregiver. It was the frantic alertness of a zookeeper who has unlocked the tiger’s cage and is now trying to coax it back inside with a piece of meat.

The game had to end. Tallulah knew she could not confront her in front of their parents; they were too deeply enmeshed in Elara’s narrative of her fragility. The confrontation had to happen in their own space, the room that had been their sanctuary, their battleground, and their tomb. She waited for the right moment with a newfound patience, a cold, reptilian stillness that was a world away from both her former obsessive passion and her recent medicated apathy. She had been the frantic storm and the empty fog; now, she was becoming the calm, calculating eye at the center of it all.

The moment came on a Tuesday night. Rain, a real, driving storm, had returned to Oviedo, lashing against the windowpane with a familiar, rhythmic violence. Elara, on edge all day, was pretending to read, but Tallulah could see she was turning the same page over and over again. Tallulah was sitting on her own bed, her back straight, her hands folded in her lap. She waited until the sounds of the apartment had settled, until the only noises were the storm outside and the frantic, unspoken thoughts inside the room. She spoke, her voice quiet but carrying an immense, chilling weight. "The first few days, I just felt confused," she began, not looking at Elara. "But now I feel… clearer. Almost clean. As if I've woken up from a long, long fever." She let the words settle in the thick air. Elara froze, her book slipping from her fingers. Slowly, Tallulah turned her head, her eyes, no longer clouded or vacant, locking onto Elara’s. The last vestiges of the fog were gone, and what was left was a gaze of diamond-hard clarity and an unnerving, absolute calm. She did not ask about the past. She did not scream or cry. She asked a simple, devastating question about the present. "Tell me, Lari," she said, her voice dropping to an intimate whisper. "Was it hard? The first time you threw them away?"The question was a key turning in a lock that had been rusted shut for months, and the sound of it made Elara’s entire body go rigid. The book, already forgotten, lay on the floor like a casualty. Her breath caught in her throat, a small, sharp sound against the drumming of the rain. For a long, silent moment, she did not look at Tallulah’s face, but at her hands, folded so calmly in her lap. They were the hands that had once held hers with a desperate, possessive force, the hands that had later lain limp and lifeless on the duvet. Now they were simply still, radiating a patient, terrifying power. The game was over. The board had been reset while she wasn’t looking, and she had been checkmated from a position of absolute strength.

Slowly, Elara raised her eyes. The face she saw was achingly familiar and yet utterly new. The last vestiges of the medicated fog were gone from Tallulah’s gaze, but so was the wild, feverish light of her old obsession. What looked back at Elara was a calm, fathomless intelligence, as clear and cold as deep water. There was no anger, no hysteria, only an unnerving, absolute knowing. The ghost had not just reanimated; it had evolved. Elara felt the last of her own carefully constructed defenses crumble to dust. There was no point in lying. This new Tallulah would see through a lie as easily as she would see through glass.

“Yes,” Elara whispered, the single word a confession and a surrender. Her voice was hoarse, a strange, foreign sound in her own ears. “It was hard. The first time.” She paused, the memory of her trembling hand over the sink, the feeling of committing an act of profound, unknowable recklessness, returning to her. “I was terrified I would break something. Or that I wouldn’t. I wasn’t sure which was worse.”

Tallulah’s expression did not change. Her calm was a physical force, pressing in on Elara, demanding more. “And after that?” she asked, her voice still quiet, still holding that chilling, conversational tone. “When it wasn’t hard anymore? What did it become then?”

The question peeled back the final layer of Elara’s self-deception, exposing the raw, selfish motive beneath. She looked away from Tallulah’s piercing gaze, toward the rain-streaked window, at the dark, distorted reflections of their room. “It became a necessity,” she admitted, the words barely audible. “Your silence… it wasn’t peaceful. It was louder than your screaming had been. It was the sound of a vacuum. You were gone, and I was alone in here with your perfect, empty shell, and I realized it was a mirror.” Her voice cracked, the first fissure in her composure. “I won. My prize was to be the sole occupant of a mausoleum. I couldn’t bear it. I had to know if the person I had buried was still capable of haunting me.”

The raw, ugly truth of her own loneliness hung in the air between them, a confession to equal the one Tallulah had made on her knees weeks ago. She had not done it for Tallulah. She had done it for herself, to escape the perfect, silent prison of her own victory. She finally dared to look back at Tallulah, expecting to see triumph, or hatred, or disgust. Instead, she saw a flicker of something else, something she could not name. It was not forgiveness. It was a profound, weary, and terrible understanding.

The storm outside began to subside, its fury giving way to a steady, rhythmic drumming that was no longer a witness, but simply the weather. In the quiet that grew between the rainfall, a new and final equilibrium was being forged. They were no longer jailer and prisoner, no longer caregiver and patient, no longer victor and vanquished. Those roles had been played, exhausted, and discarded. They had stripped each other down to the bone, exposed every lie, every manipulation, every selfish, desperate motive. And what was left were two people who knew each other with a terrifying, absolute clarity that no one else in the world could ever approach. They were two survivors of a war only they had fought, standing in the ruins of the world they had built and then systematically destroyed.

Tallulah slowly unfolded her hands. She did not rise from the bed. She simply looked at Elara, her calm gaze holding an entire, unspoken history. “So here we are,” she said, her voice a low murmur, a statement of fact, not a question. “The ghost and the necromancer. What happens now?”

Elara had no answer. The future, which had been a straight, grey, predictable line stretching into infinity, was now a complete and terrifying blank. But as she looked at Tallulah—not the frantic lover, not the hollow doll, but this strange, cold, lucid creature who was the work of both their hands—she knew one thing for certain. The silence in the room was no longer unbearable. It was not full, as it had been in the beginning, nor was it empty, as it had been in the end. It was simply a space. A space that held two people who were finally, horribly, and irrevocably, equals. And in that terrifying balance, for the first time in a very long time, there was the faint, dangerous possibility of a choice.The question hung in the quiet air, a stark and simple query that held the weight of their entire, brutal history. *What happens now?* Elara had no answer. The future, which she had so carefully curated first into a bleak, predictable line and then blasted into terrifying uncertainty, was a blank page. She looked at Tallulah, truly looked at her, and saw not the girl she had loved or the monster she had hated or the doll she had broken. She saw a stranger forged in a fire of their mutual making, a person whose inner landscape was now as unknown and potentially as dangerous as her own. The fear she felt was a clean, sharp thing, stripped of the messy edges of guilt and anger. It was the primal fear of the unpredictable, of an equal force whose next move was a complete mystery. For months, she had held all the power, wielding it with the quiet tyranny of a caregiver. Now, the power in the room was a perfectly balanced scale, and the stillness was not peace, but the held breath before a verdict.

The next morning began not with a confrontation, but with a quiet, chilling demonstration of the new order. Elara rose first, her movements stiff and uncertain, her mind racing with a thousand possible scenarios. She expected Tallulah to remain in bed, a silent, judging presence. Instead, Tallulah rose as well, her own movements calm and deliberate. They dressed in a silence that was not hostile, but deeply watchful. When they emerged for breakfast, Isabel and Javier were already at the table, their faces etched with a wary concern after the storm of the night before. They looked to Elara for the daily report, the signal of Tallulah’s state. It was Tallulah who spoke first. “I slept well,” she said, her voice clear and even. She took her seat and reached for the coffee pot, pouring a cup for herself and then, without a flicker of hesitation, one for Elara. “I think the storm cleared the air.” The simple, domestic act, the calm, rational statement, was a seismic event. Isabel and Javier exchanged a look of dazed, hopeful relief. It was progress. It was a miracle. But Elara, as she accepted the cup, her fingers brushing against Tallulah’s, felt the gesture for what it was: the opening move in a new, infinitely more complex game. They were a team again, and Tallulah was its captain.

Later, when they were alone in their room, the unspoken negotiation began. Tallulah did not pace or weep. She sat on the edge of her bed and looked at Elara, her gaze analytical and devoid of sentiment. “The lies are over,” she stated, her voice low. “Between us. To them,” she gestured vaguely toward the rest of the apartment, “we will give them the story they want. The story of my recovery, and your heroic part in it. It’s a better story than the truth, and they are desperate for it. We will perform it perfectly.” She paused, letting the weight of the proposal settle. “But in here, in this room, there will be no more lies. No more secrets. You will not manage my life, and I will not haunt yours. We are bound together, Lari. By love and by hate, by everything we’ve done to each other. Leaving is not an option for either of us. It would be an admission of defeat, and we have both lost too much to afford that.” Her words were not a plea or a threat; they were a diagnosis, a statement of the conditions under which they would both continue to live.

Elara listened, a profound, weary stillness settling over her. This was her sentence. It was not a punishment of rage or vengeance, but a far more terrible fate: a life of shared, conscious artifice. She would not be forgiven, but she would not be condemned. She would be a partner. She had wanted to escape her hollow victory, to reanimate the ghost in her mausoleum, and she had succeeded beyond her wildest imaginings. The ghost was not only awake; it was now proposing the new architectural plans for their shared tomb. There was no escape. This new, cold, lucid Tallulah was her creation, her responsibility, and her destiny. To reject this pact would be to plunge them back into a war of attrition that she no longer had the strength or the will to fight. She had one move left on the board, and it was to accept the draw. “Alright,” she said, the word feeling small and inadequate. “A perfect performance.”

Their first walk in the city under the new treaty felt like a clandestine meeting between two spies. The sun was out, bright and sharp, and the streets of Oviedo were bustling with a life that seemed to belong to another planet. The silence between them was no longer an emotional battlefield, but a functional, private space. They moved through the familiar streets, their steps in sync, but they were not retracing old memories. They were planning their next campaign. “Mamá wants to have Clara over for dinner on Friday,” Tallulah said, her voice a low, conversational murmur, her eyes fixed straight ahead. “To celebrate my ‘progress’. We’ll need to have our stories aligned. You should tell her I’ve been talking more about my classes, showing an interest in the future.” Elara nodded, her mind processing the directive. “And I’ll say you’ve started drawing again,” she countered, her own voice just as quiet. “Not the dark things. The city. Flowers. A sign of returning to the light.” It was a business transaction, a cold-blooded scripting of the lives they would now pretend to lead. They passed the Plaza de la Foncalada, and neither of them spared it a glance. The fountain, the site of their first kiss and their first post-resurrection crack, was now just a landmark on a map, a piece of scenery on the stage where they would live out the rest of their lives, bound together not by love, but by the unbreakable chains of their shared, terrible knowledge.
