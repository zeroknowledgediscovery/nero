The rain didn't so much fall on Wolverhampton as it was wrung out over it, a final, grudging rinse from a sky the colour of a council-issue flannel. It slicked the cobbles of Queen Street with a greasy sheen and made the gargoyles on St. Peter's Collegiate Church look like they were weeping oily tears. From her third-floor flat above a shop that sold vaping liquids in flavours like ‘Unicorn Dream’ and ‘Banshee’s Breakfast’, Esme Blackwood watched the 59 bus hiss past, its windows steamed and blurry with the breath of miserable commuters. Home time. For some.

Her own work was just beginning. The object on her kitchen table, nestled between a half-eaten bag of cheese and onion crisps and a precarious stack of overdue library books, was a smartphone. A sleek, modern thing of glass and black metal that ought to have been silent. It wasn't. It was humming. A low, fretful thrum that vibrated through the cheap pine of the table and made the tea in her mug tremble. Occasionally, it would twitch, skittering a centimetre to the left as if trying to escape its own skin.

“Alright, settle down,” Esme murmured, wiping crisp dust from her fingers onto her jeans. “Nobody’s going to factory reset you.”

She leaned closer, her own reflection—a pale face, a storm of dark, unruly hair, eyes the colour of strong tea—wavering on the screen. The hum intensified. The air around the phone grew cold, a pocket of morgue-like chill in her otherwise stuffy flat. This was her trade. Not potions in cauldrons or grand incantations under the full moon. Esme was a fixer. A magical mechanic. People in the know, the ones who saw the cracks in the world, came to her when their lives went sideways. She found lost things that had slipped into the In-Between, she placated the spirits of grumpy old men who’d decided to haunt the local betting shop, and, in this case, she de-haunted technology.

This one was a doozy. A ‘pernicious data-wraith’, according to its terrified owner, a graphic designer from Penn who’d downloaded a pirated bit of software from a very unsavoury corner of the ethereal web. The wraith had started by draining his battery, then moved on to corrupting his files with snippets of mournful poetry written in an obscure Mesopotamian dialect. Last night, it had started making phantom calls to his ex-girlfriend. That’s when he’d called Esme.

Her tools weren't wands and crystal balls. They were a set of tiny, silver-etched screwdrivers, a bowl of salt mixed with iron filings, and a heavily modified USB stick she’d named ‘The Exorcist’. She circled the phone, humming a tuneless little ditty under her breath, a half-remembered nursery rhyme her nan used to sing. It was a nonsense song, but it had a rhythm, a cadence that helped her focus her will. Her particular set of skills wasn't about flash and bang; it was about resonance. Finding the frequency of a thing—be it ghost, curse, or lost locket—and either tuning into it or shaking it until it fell apart.

She picked up the salt bowl. The phone buzzed angrily, the screen flashing with a single, glowing red pixel. A primitive, binary rage.

“Oh, stop your whinging,” she said, her voice dropping into a lower, more resonant tone. She began to sprinkle the salt and iron in a precise circle around the device. “You’ve had your fun, messing with Kevin’s love life. Time to go back to the static.”

The air thickened. The smell of ozone and old, forgotten information filled the small kitchen. She could feel the wraith’s panic, a thin, needle-like spike of fear in the back of her mind. It was a lonely thing, a fragment of a dead programmer’s consciousness, probably. Trapped in the code, desperate for connection, however destructive. For a second, a flicker of something that might have been pity stirred in her. She stamped on it. Pity didn't pay the gas bill.

She plugged The Exorcist into her laptop, the ancient, clunky machine whirring to life with a groan. A simple black command window opened on the screen. She typed a single line, a string of symbols that shimmered as they appeared, part programming language, part sigil.

> run_containment_protocol.exe -target_signature[wraith:lonely] -redirect_to[null_field]

She hit Enter.

The phone on the table let out a screech, a sound like a thousand dial-up modems screaming in unison. It levitated a few inches, the circle of salt flaring with a brief, blue light. The red pixel on its screen expanded, consuming the black, then collapsed in on itself, leaving only the manufacturer’s logo. The humming stopped. The chill in the air vanished, replaced by the mundane warmth of her flat and the faint smell of burnt dust. Silence.

Esme unplugged the USB stick and nudged the phone with her finger. It remained still. Job done. She’d text Kevin in the morning. That would be two hundred quid, plus a little extra for the emotional distress clause involving the ex-girlfriend. Enough to cover rent and maybe even a trip to the big Tesco instead of the sad-looking corner shop.

A sharp, insistent knock echoed from her front door, making her jump. It wasn’t the gentle tap of a neighbour asking to borrow milk. This was a frantic, percussive rapping that spoke of frayed nerves and desperation. Client o’clock, then. Her shoulders sagged. So much for a quiet night in with a book and the rest of the crisps.

She peered through the spyhole. A man, elderly, impeccably dressed in a tweed jacket that looked out of place even when it wasn't soaked through, stood fidgeting in the grim hallway of her building. He was clutching a large, empty glass goldfish bowl to his chest like a holy relic. His face was pale, his eyes wide with a terror that was entirely genuine. This wasn't a haunted iPhone. This was something else.

With a sigh, she undid the three locks on her door. “Can I help you?”

The man, who introduced himself as Arthur Pumble, practically fell inside. He smelled of rain, old paper, and a cloying, sweet pipe tobacco. Water dripped from the brim of his hat onto her worn laminate flooring. His distress was a tangible thing, a cloud of anxiety that seemed to suck the air out of the room.

“Miss Blackwood? They said… they said you find things,” he stammered, his gaze darting around her cluttered flat before settling back on her face. “The unusual things.”

“Sometimes,” Esme said, crossing her arms. “Depends on how unusual. And if they want to be found. What’s missing?”

He held up the goldfish bowl. A single drop of water traced a path down the inside. “Sir Reginald.”

Esme blinked. “You’ve lost your goldfish.”

“He is not just a goldfish!” Mr. Pumble’s voice rose, cracking with emotion. “He was… a seer. An oracle. The pattern of his scales, the way he swam… he could show you things. Glimpses. Possibilities.” He clutched the bowl tighter. “He warned me the Wolves would lose to Coventry last season. I didn't listen! I lost twenty pounds!”

Esme fought the urge to close the door in his face. A prophetic fish. The city coughed up stranger things on a regular basis. Still. “Okay. So Sir Reginald is missing. Did he jump out? Did the cat get him?”

“I don’t have a cat!” he wailed. “I was making a cup of tea. I was gone for no more than two minutes. When I came back…” He shuddered. “The bowl was as you see it. Empty. The water was gone. All of it. And the window was open. It was locked from the inside.”

Now that was more interesting. Vanishing water. A locked room mystery. Her professional curiosity stirred, overriding her weariness. “Can I see the bowl?”

He handed it to her reverently. She took it to the kitchen, setting it down where the phone had been. The glass was strangely clean. Too clean. Not even a smear of algae. She ran a finger along the inside. It was bone dry and held a faint, residual cold. She closed her eyes, extending that specific sense she had, the one that tasted the echoes of recent events.

Most magic, her own included, left a flavour. A lingering sensation on the tongue of the mind. A binding spell tasted of burnt sugar and iron. A healing charm, of honey and wild herbs. The data-wraith had tasted of static and loneliness. She focused on the bowl, breathing in, tasting the air within its confines.

The echo here was vile.

It was a flavour of profound emptiness, of predatory hunger. It tasted of the abyss, of a vacuum that didn't just lack life but actively despised it. It was cold and sharp and… slick. Like swallowing a mouthful of oil and ice. Underneath it all was a dominant, unmistakable note. Salt. Not the clean salt of the sea, but a dead, briny flavour. The taste of tears, perhaps. Or blood.

And something else. Something buried so deep it was almost undetectable. A faint, harmonic resonance that plucked a string deep inside her own magical signature. It was like hearing a beloved song mangled, played off-key by a spiteful child. It was familiar and utterly wrong, and a shiver that had nothing to do with the rain crawled its way up her spine.

“Someone took him,” she said, her voice quiet. “They didn't just take the fish, they… consumed him. The water too. Every last drop of life and magic.”

Mr. Pumble let out a small, wounded sound.

“I need to go to your house,” Esme told him, her mind already racing. The familiarity of that magical signature was a hook. A puzzle. This wasn't just a job anymore. This was personal. “I need to see where it happened.”

Mr. Pumble’s home was a neat semi-detached in a quiet cul-de-sac in Bradmore, a world away from the city centre's grimy hustle. The lawn was manicured, the windows were clean, and a Neighbourhood Watch sticker was displayed prominently in the front window. It was the epitome of suburban normality, which only made the violation feel worse.

The room was a study, lined with books and smelling of Mr. Pumble's pipe tobacco. The goldfish bowl had sat on a handsome mahogany desk overlooking the garden. Everything was neat, tidy, undisturbed. Except for the lingering chill and that foul, hungry taste in the air, stronger here at the source.

Esme ignored Mr. Pumble’s fretful hovering and got to work. She walked the perimeter of the room, her fingertips grazing the wallpaper. Nothing. The window, as he’d said, was locked from the inside, the latch firm. No sign of forced entry. No scuff marks on the sill. She crouched by the desk, examining the floor. Her eyes scanned the plush, beige carpet.

And there it was. So small and dark it was almost invisible against the weave. She leaned in closer. It wasn't a bit of dirt or a dead insect. It was a scale. Not a fish scale. It was a perfect, crescent-shaped sliver of black. It looked like a shard of obsidian, but it was too thin, and it curved with an organic grace. It was no bigger than her little fingernail.

She knew better than to touch it with her bare skin. She pulled a pair of tweezers from the small leather toolkit she carried in her coat pocket and carefully picked it up. As soon as the metal touched it, a wave of cold washed over her, and the hungry, briny taste flooded her senses again, stronger than ever. The scale seemed to drink the warmth from the air around it. This was a piece of the thief. A calling card, left behind by accident.

“What is it?” Mr. Pumble asked, his voice a reedy whisper.

“A clue,” Esme said, dropping the scale into a small, lead-lined evidence pouch. “I think I know someone who might be able to tell me what—or who—this belongs to.”

Her mind was already on Tariq. Tariq, who ran the twenty-four-hour kebab shop near the bus station and knew more about the city’s occult underground than anyone. He traded in information the way he traded in doner meat: messily, with a side of greasy paper, and for a price. He would know. Or he’d know someone who knew.

She turned back to Mr. Pumble. “I’m sorry about Sir Reginald. But I’m going to find who did this.” The promise felt heavier than usual. It wasn't just about a stolen pet anymore. That twisted, familiar echo of the magic involved had burrowed under her skin. It felt like an insult. Like a challenge. Like a dark reflection she had to track down, if only to smash it. She had a very particular set of skills, and right now, they were all screaming in the direction of a witch who had an appetite for the magical and the mundane, and left behind nothing but a taste of cold, salty despair. And a single, black scale.She left Mr. Pumble standing in his doorway, a small, lost figure framed by the warm light of his hallway, clutching a leaflet for a grief counselling service she’d pressed into his hand. It was the best she could offer for now. The rain had eased to a persistent drizzle, and the streetlights of Bradmore cast long, watery reflections on the wet tarmac. It was a quiet, orderly world of trimmed hedges and sleeping cars, and the predatory magic she’d tasted felt like a slash of graffiti on a masterpiece. It didn't belong here, which made its presence all the more obscene. She pulled the collar of her coat up and walked quickly towards the main road, the lead-lined pouch in her pocket feeling unnaturally cold against her hip.

The bus ride back into the city was a jarring transition. The quiet grief of the suburbs gave way to the loud, anonymous melancholy of the late-night run. The windows were still fogged, the air thick with the smell of damp coats and chip shop vinegar. Esme stared out at the blurred ribbon of orange streetlights, turning the puzzle over in her mind. A creature that consumed magic, life, and water, all in one go. A creature that could pass through a locked window without leaving a trace, save for a single black scale and a signature of abyssal hunger. The familiarity of it nagged at her, a dissonant chord she couldn't place. Her own magic was about resonance, about tuning into the world. This felt like the opposite: a focused, devouring silence. It was a cancellation. An anti-magic.

Tariq’s place, ‘The Bosphorus Grill’, was wedged between a boarded-up pub and a 24-hour laundrette, its neon sign—a winking fez-wearing chef—bleeding red and green light onto the slick pavement. It was an oasis of greasy warmth and light in the dark sprawl of the bus station quarter. Inside, the air was a rich tapestry of smells: sizzling lamb, sharp chili sauce, the yeasty perfume of warm pitta bread, and underlying it all, the faint, metallic scent of old magic and secrets. Tariq was behind the counter, a mountain of a man with a magnificent, salt-and-pepper beard, methodically slicing meat from the towering elephant’s leg with a knife that looked sharp enough to shave a rumour.

He glanced up as she came in, his dark eyes missing nothing. He didn’t smile, but one corner of his mouth twitched in acknowledgement. He served the last customer in the queue—a spectral-looking teenager who paid in odd, pre-decimal coinage—before turning his full attention to Esme.
“Late one for you, Blackwood,” he rumbled, his voice as deep as the fryer oil. “The wraith give you trouble?”

“Nothing The Exorcist couldn’t handle,” she said, leaning against the stainless-steel counter. The warmth from the grill was a welcome comfort. “I need something else. Information.”

Tariq wiped his long knife on a cloth that had seen better decades. “Information is my second-best-selling product. It costs more than a large doner with extra chili.” He gestured with his head towards the small, laminated menu taped to the counter. “My prices are clearly displayed.”

“This is different, Tariq. This is… weird.” She waited until they were alone, the last customer having drifted out into the night. She took the lead pouch from her pocket, undid the clasp, and used her tweezers to slide the single black scale onto a clean paper napkin on the counter.

Tariq’s practiced nonchalance evaporated. He leaned forward, the jovial kebab-man persona falling away to reveal the shrewd, wary information broker beneath. He didn’t touch the scale, but his eyes narrowed, tracing its perfect, crescent shape. The air in the shop seemed to cool, the smell of grilling meat overpowered for a moment by that same faint, briny emptiness Esme had tasted in the goldfish bowl. Tariq took a half-step back from the counter, a subtle but deeply telling movement.

“Where did you get this?” he asked, his voice low and stripped of its usual warmth.

“A client’s house. Something paid a visit. Took a… pet. A magical one.”

“A pet,” Tariq repeated, but he wasn’t looking at her. His gaze was fixed on the scale, as if it might move. “It fed, then. Burn this. Throw it in the furnace at the old foundry. Forget you ever saw it. Tell your client his pet ran away. This is not your business, Esme.”

The stark fear in his voice was more alarming than any magical signature. Tariq had sold her information on everything from rogue boggarts in the Mander Centre to the correct rituals for appeasing the territorial water spirit in the Dudley Canal. He had never once told her to walk away.
“I can’t do that,” she said, her voice steady despite the knot tightening in her stomach. “It’s personal. The signature felt… familiar. Twisted, but familiar.”

That made him look at her. A long, searching look. He sighed, a heavy, world-weary sound, and ran a hand over his face. “There are old stories. Bogeyman tales we tell to frighten the new bloods. About things that come from the water, but not any water you’d find on a map. Things that hate the song of the world. They don't have a name. We call them the Lacunae.”

“The Lacunae,” Esme repeated. The word felt right. Empty. A space where something should be. “What are they?”

“Holes,” he said, gesturing vaguely with his knife. “Holes in the shape of people. They are drawn to resonance, to magic, to strong life. Not to feed on it in the way a vampire feeds on blood, to sustain themselves. They feed on it to extinguish it. To create more silence. More of what they are. They unmake things, Esme. They don't steal a fish, they erase it from the world. They drink the water and leave the memory of thirst.” He shuddered, a genuine tremor that shook his large frame. “That familiar signature you felt? They are mimics. Echoes. They reflect what they consume. A Lacuna might taste like a ghost it ate last week, or a curse it unravelled yesterday. Or… it might taste a little like the magic of the person hunting it.”

A profound chill settled over Esme, colder than any data-wraith. The thing was tasting her. Through the clues, through the echoes, it was learning her flavour. The hunt was no longer one-sided. “This one left a scale, Tariq. That’s not just a hole. That’s a creature.”

“They are getting bolder, then. Or clumsier,” he muttered, glancing towards the rain-streaked window as if expecting to see a face peering in. “There is one… a woman. She was seen down by the old wharves, near the canal locks. They say she pays for things with saltwater pearls that are cold to the touch. They say she looks at you and you forget your own name for a moment. They call her the Mourner.”

“The Mourner,” Esme said, the name settling into place with a dreadful click. The salty taste of tears. A creature of sorrow and emptiness.

Tariq pushed the napkin with the scale back towards her with the tip of his knife. “This is free, Esme. A warning. Stay away from the wharves. Stay away from the Mourner. Some things, even you cannot fix. Some things are just meant to be broken.”The warmth of the Bosphorus Grill bled away the second Esme stepped back out into the Wolverhampton night, leaving her feeling exposed and chilled to the bone. Tariq’s warning echoed in her mind, far more frightening than the phantom calls of a data-wraith. *Holes in the shape of people. They unmake things.* It was a concept that her particular brand of magic struggled to grasp. Her entire craft was built on the principle that everything left a trace, an echo, a resonance that could be found and tuned. How could she possibly find something whose very nature was absence? It was like trying to pick a lock with a fistful of smoke. And yet, the alternative—letting this… this *Lacuna* continue its silent, ravenous consumption of her city—felt like a dereliction of duty. More than that, it felt like surrender. The twisted familiarity of its signature was a personal affront, a dark parody of her own skills. Tariq had told her to walk away, but every instinct she possessed, every fibre of her being that defined her as a fixer, screamed at her to run towards the problem.

The walk to the canal wharves was a journey through the city’s forgotten layers. She left the main drag of tarmac and streetlights, dipping into the narrow, cobbled back-alleys that snaked between the old industrial buildings of the ring road's inner edge. The sounds of the city shifted. The hum of traffic and distant sirens was replaced by the lonely sigh of the wind funnelling between brick walls and the quiet, secretive lapping of water against stone. The air grew heavier, smelling of damp earth, rust, and the deep, cold scent of the canal itself, a scent that had soaked into the foundations of this part of the city for two hundred years. It was a liminal space, belonging neither to the past nor the present, a scar of water cutting through the heart of the modern town. It was exactly the sort of place a thing that slipped through cracks would feel at home.

She found the wharves huddled around a wide, stagnant basin where the canal broadened before plunging into a series of deep locks. Derelict red-brick warehouses, their windows smashed like vacant eyes, stood sentinel over the black, unmoving water. Corrugated iron fences sagged, festooned with graffiti that had faded into the general grime. Under the jaundiced orange glow of a single, flickering security light, the place looked like a half-remembered nightmare. And here, the taste in the air, the flavour on her magical palate, was overwhelming. It was the crushing pressure of the deep ocean, the absolute cold of interstellar space. It was a hungry silence that actively sought to devour the sounds of her footsteps, the beat of her own heart. The briny note of salt and sorrow was so strong it was almost a physical sensation, coating her tongue and the back of her throat.

Her usual methods felt clumsy here. Tuning into a resonance was impossible when the target was a void. Instead, she had to reverse her technique. Closing her eyes, she didn't listen for a sound, but for the most profound point of silence. She extended her senses, not to find a magical signature, but to find its absolute cancellation. It felt unnatural, like trying to feel her way through a pitch-black room by searching for the spots where the darkness was thickest. She let the sucking emptiness pull at her, using it as a grim compass. It led her away from the open basin, along a narrow towpath slick with algae, towards a low, sprawling warehouse set back from the water's edge. Its massive sliding door was open just a crack, a sliver of deeper blackness against the gloom. The cold, hungry void emanated from within.

She slid through the gap, her boots crunching softly on a floor scattered with grit and broken glass. Inside, the warehouse was a cavern of shadows, held up by rusted iron pillars. Moonlight lanced down through holes in the roof, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still, frigid air. The sheer force of the null-signature in here was staggering; it felt like a weight on her chest, making it hard to breathe. The place was unnervingly bare. Not just abandoned, but scoured. There were no discarded pallets, no rubbish, no signs of the squatters or kids who usually colonized such places. It was clean. Too clean. It was the same sterile, violated emptiness as Mr. Pumble’s goldfish bowl, magnified a hundred times.

Her eyes adjusted to the gloom, and she saw that the space wasn’t entirely empty. In the centre of the vast floor, arranged in a neat, deliberate circle, was a collection of objects. Husks. She crept closer, her heart thudding a nervous, defiant rhythm against the crushing silence. There was a tarnished silver music box, its lid open. She reached out and flicked the tiny winding key. The mechanism turned, the cylinder rotated, but it produced no sound, not even a mechanical click. There was an old leather-bound diary, its pages filled with elegant, faded script that her eyes could see but her mind couldn't parse; the words had been stripped of all meaning, reduced to empty squiggles. Beside it lay a child’s worn teddy bear, its button eyes staring blankly, utterly devoid of the lingering affection and history that usually clung to such things. It was just a sack of stuffing. Sir Reginald hadn't been the first victim. He wasn't even the tenth.

This wasn't just about consuming magic. It was about erasing resonance. The music box had lost its tune. The diary, its stories. The bear, its love. The Mourner was a connoisseur of sentiment, of memory, of meaning. And she was starving. A wave of nausea and a spike of pure, primal fear shot through Esme. This was an order of magnitude beyond a grumpy ghost or a cursed phone. This was a fundamental predator of everything that made life worth living. As she stared at the pathetic circle of empty things, a flicker of movement at the far end of the warehouse caught her eye. There, standing on the edge of the canal basin where the back wall of the warehouse had crumbled away, was a figure. A tall, slender woman, wrapped in a long, dark coat that seemed to shift and ripple like disturbed water. Even from this distance, Esme could feel it—the absolute zero at the heart of the void. It was her. The Mourner. She stood perfectly still, looking out over the black water, as if waiting. And Esme had the sudden, terrifying realisation that she hadn't found this place by skill alone. She had been led. The trail of clues wasn't a mistake. It was an invitation.The thought was as cold and sharp as a sliver of glass in her mind: *This is a trap*. Not a cage of iron and steel, but one of curated silence and dread. The circle of unmade things was the bait, the warehouse was the cage, and the spider was now turning slowly, deliberately, from her vigil over the water. The Mourner moved with an unnatural fluidity, her long, dark coat not so much rippling as seeming to absorb the faint moonlight, leaving eddies of pure blackness in its wake. As she turned her face towards Esme, Esme’s breath caught in her throat. It was a face she couldn’t quite see. Like an overexposed photograph or a memory worn smooth with time, the features were indistinct, a blur of pale skin and shadow where eyes and a mouth should be. The one detail that was horribly clear was an impression of immense, ancient sorrow.

“You are so loud,” a voice said. It didn’t echo in the cavernous space. It simply arrived in Esme’s head, a flat, toneless whisper devoid of any warmth or resonance. It was the auditory equivalent of a grey wall. “All this time, I have felt you. A little bell, ringing and ringing in the dark. I had to see what was making the noise.”

Every instinct Esme had screamed at her to run, but her feet felt rooted to the spot. The oppressive silence was no longer just an absence of sound; it was an active force, pressing in, trying to smother the frantic drumming of her own pulse, to still the frantic whirring of her thoughts. She fought to hold onto herself, to the core of who she was: Esme Blackwood, fixer, resident of a third-floor flat, owner of overdue library books, fan of cheese and onion crisps. These mundane details became a mantra, a shield of identity against the encroaching void.

“What did you do to them?” Esme asked, her voice sounding thin and shockingly vibrant in the dead air. She gestured towards the pathetic circle of husks on the floor. “The fish. The music box.”

“I quieted them,” the Mourner whispered in her mind. “They were full of noise. The fish dreamed of futures. The diary screamed with yesterdays. The bear bled affection. All of it, so loud. So needless. I gave them peace. I gave them the gift of silence.”

The creature drifted forward, gliding over the broken glass without a sound. With every foot she advanced, the cold intensified, and Esme felt a strange new sensation: a thinning of her own memories. The name of the man from Penn who’d owned the haunted phone grew fuzzy. The taste of the tea she’d been drinking an hour ago vanished from her mind’s tongue. The Mourner wasn’t just consuming the world around her; she was consuming the memory of it from those who witnessed her. This was how she remained a rumour, a bogeyman tale. She erased her own trail not just from the world, but from the minds of those who crossed it.

“That feeling you felt,” the toneless voice continued, “that echo of yourself. It is because we are opposites. You resonate. You amplify. You bind the world together with strings of meaning and memory. You make noise. I unbind. I unravel. I return things to the perfect, clean silence that came before the first sound was ever made. Your work is a temporary fix. My work is permanent.”

Esme’s hand went instinctively to the pocket of her coat, her fingers brushing against the cool metal of her silver-etched screwdrivers. She knew, with a dreadful certainty, that they would be useless. How do you unscrew an absence? Her other hand found the familiar rectangular shape of The Exorcist. *redirect_to[null_field]*. The line of code she had typed flashed in her mind. It was a desperate, insane idea, like trying to put out a fire with a photograph of the ocean. But it was the only idea she had. She fumbled the USB from her pocket, her fingers clumsy with cold and fear.

The Mourner was only twenty feet away now. Esme could see a detail in her shifting coat: tiny, dark crescent shapes were embedded in the fabric, like a thousand overlapping black scales. The one from Mr. Pumble’s carpet hadn't been a piece of her, but a seed. A calling card of nothingness, planted to grow a trail of silence for Esme to follow. The creature’s blank face tilted, a gesture of what might have been curiosity. “What is that? Another noisy little toy?”

“Something like that,” Esme breathed, clutching the USB stick so tightly her knuckles were white. She didn't have a port, she didn't have a computer. But her magic wasn't in the hardware; it was in the intent. It was about resonance and will. She closed her eyes, focusing all her energy, all her stubborn, defiant *being*, into the small object in her hand. She didn’t try to find a frequency. She pictured a door. A door to absolute zero, to the null_field her spell referenced. And then, she pictured swinging that door wide open and shoving.

She poured her will into The Exorcist. *run_containment_protocol.exe*.

The effect was instantaneous and utterly bizarre. There was no flash of light, no screech of tortured modems. Instead, for a single, heart-stopping moment, the all-consuming silence in the warehouse was *doubled*. A feedback loop of nothingness. The Mourner stopped dead, and for the first time, a flicker of something—confusion? irritation?—crossed her indistinct features. Her form wavered violently, the edges blurring and fraying as two competing voids warred with each other. The cold in the room plunged to an impossible, painful depth. A fine layer of frost instantly bloomed across the concrete floor. The Mourner let out a sound—not in Esme's mind, but a real, physical sound. It was the dry, scraping sound of stone grinding on stone, a sound of utter friction and wrongness.

That was Esme’s chance. The momentary disruption was all she would get. She turned and ran. She didn’t look back. She scrambled over rubble, her lungs burning from the frigid air, and burst out of the warehouse, back into the damp, living night. The sounds of the city rushed back in to greet her—the distant wail of a siren, the hum of the motorway, the gentle lapping of the canal water. They were the most beautiful sounds she had ever heard. She didn't stop running until the orange streetlights of the main road were bright around her and the air she was gulping down tasted only of rain and exhaust fumes, not of cold, salty despair. She leaned against a brick wall, her chest heaving, The Exorcist still clutched in her hand. It was warm to the touch now, almost hot, as if it had absorbed a fever. The job was no longer about a prophetic goldfish. It was about a hole in the world that was getting bolder, a silent predator that had tasted her magic and found it interesting. And now, it knew her name.The journey back to her flat was a study in disconnect. Esme sat numbly on the upper deck of the 59 bus, the same bus she’d watched from her window what felt like a lifetime ago. The windows were still steamed, the faces of her fellow passengers still etched with the gentle, work-a-day misery of a wet Tuesday night. But now, Esme saw them differently. She saw them as the Mourner must: noisy vessels, brimming with memories of first loves and favourite songs, anxieties about gas bills, cherished family jokes, the quiet pride of a well-tended garden. They were resonant, each a unique symphony of life and experience. And they were fragile. The thought that the creature from the wharf could drift through this bus, plucking the memories from these people like lint from a coat, leaving them as hollowed-out husks, filled her with a cold, protective fury that burned brighter than her fear.

Her flat, when she finally reached it, felt like a fortress. The clutter, the smell of stale crisps and cooling tea, the very stuffiness of the air—it was all proof of life, a bulwark against the sterile emptiness she had fled. She bolted all three locks on her door, an act that felt both futile and absolutely necessary, and sagged against the wood, her heart still a frantic drum against her ribs. In the relative safety of her own kitchen, under the buzzing fluorescent light, she finally dared to properly examine The Exorcist. It was still unnaturally warm, a smooth, fevered heat that had nothing to do with electronics. The silver-etched sigils that spiralled along its casing seemed darker, deeper, as if they’d been re-etched with ink made of shadow. When she held it close, she could feel a faint, discordant vibration, a lingering echo of the awful, grinding noise the Mourner had made. Her tool hadn't just fought the void; it had recorded it.

Ignoring the de-haunted smartphone that sat placidly on her table, a relic from a simpler time, she put the kettle on. The familiar ritual of making tea—spooning leaves into the pot, waiting for the boil, the pour—was a deliberate act of noisy, mundane existence. It was a small spell of normalcy against the encroaching silence. She sat heavily at her table, the warmth of the mug a welcome anchor for her trembling hands. The face of Arthur Pumble swam in her mind’s eye, his genuine, heartbreaking grief for his prophetic fish. It wasn't just a fish. It was a creature full of little magics, of tiny, shimmering futures. The Mourner had started small, picking off the city’s minor magics like a gourmet sampling canapés before the main course. Now it had tasted a fixer, a nexus of magical energy, and it would want more. This wasn't a job anymore; it was pest control on a metaphysical scale.

Her gaze fell upon the precarious stack of overdue library books, a testament to her constant, scatter-gun thirst for knowledge. Usually, they were a source of mild guilt, a problem to be solved with a handful of change and a sheepish apology. Tonight, they looked like an arsenal. Her own magic, the magic of resonance, had proven to be a liability, a dinner bell for the Lacuna. Tariq’s knowledge was born of fear; he knew how to hide, not how to fight. She needed a new angle, an older one. She needed a magic that wasn't about finding frequencies, but about building foundations. A magic of story, of stone, of things so solid with meaning they could not be unmade.

With a surge of purpose, she pulled the stack towards her, sending the half-eaten bag of crisps skittering to the floor. She ignored it. There was a copy of a popular thriller, a dense academic text on quantum entanglement she’d only half-understood, and a collection of modern poetry. But her hands went to the one at the very bottom, a heavy, cloth-bound volume with a faded cover. Its title was unassuming: ‘Black Country Cant: A Lexicon of Forgotten Rhymes and Industrial Folklore’. She’d checked it out months ago for a case involving a mischievous spirit in a Dudley nail factory and had forgotten to return it. Her nan, who had been born and raised in the shadow of the foundries, had sung her some of these rhymes as a child. The nonsense songs, the focusing tools. She flipped through the brittle, yellowed pages, the scent of old paper and dust filling the air. She passed over skipping songs and factory chants, looking for something specific. And then she found it. It was a short, grim little rhyme, listed under the heading ‘Waterway Warnings’. It wasn't one her nan had ever sung.

*The cut runs deep, the cut runs black,*
*Don’t look in, it won’t look back.*
*But if you see a face of tears,*
*That feeds on songs and passing years,*
*You need a lock, you need a key,*
*You need a fire of memory.*
*You need a name the water fears,*
*And sing the song the girder hears.*

It was a child's poem about a monster, a piece of local folklore designed to keep children away from the dangerous canal towpaths. But reading it now, after what she had seen, it felt less like a fairy tale and more like a set of instructions. *A fire of memory. A name the water fears.* And the final, cryptic line: *And sing the song the girder hears.* It was absurd, nonsensical. And yet, it resonated with a deep, foundational truth, a kind of magic that predated USB sticks and data-wraiths. It was the magic of iron and industry, of place and past. A girder's song. In a city built on steel and coal, a city whose very bones were iron, it was a concept that held immense power. She had a new path to follow, a new set of clues. The Mourner thought her a bell to be silenced. Esme was about to learn how to be a forge.The dawn that broke over Wolverhampton was no kinder than the previous evening’s rain. It was a grudging, grey light that revealed a city washed clean of its nightly grime but not its weariness. Esme stood at her kitchen window, the half-empty mug of tea cold in her hands, watching the first of the day’s buses hiss its way down Queen Street. The fear from the wharf had receded, but what it left behind was a stark and unfamiliar landscape in her own mind. Her little magics, her intuitive resonances and quick fixes, felt like children’s toys in the face of the profound wrongness she had encountered. The Mourner hadn't just scared her; it had shown her the limits of her own power, and that was a far more terrifying prospect. Her gaze fell on the open book on her table, the grim little rhyme a stark set of blueprints for a war she had no idea how to wage. *A fire of memory. A name the water fears. The song the girder hears.* It was a language she barely spoke, a magic rooted not in ether and will, but in history and substance.

Her first move was not towards her usual network of spectral contacts or back to Tariq’s kebab-scented sanctuary. Instead, she put on her coat and walked to the city archives, a hushed and solemn building of sandstone and polished wood that smelled of dust, deteriorating paper, and the slow, patient decay of facts. It felt like stepping into another country. Here, the currency was not favour or quid, but catalogue numbers and silent, studious concentration. She felt exposed without the familiar hum of ambient magic, like a musician in a soundproof room. But the rhyme demanded a different kind of listening. She wasn’t hunting a ghost; she was excavating a defence. For hours, she sat at a long oak table, poring over brittle, oversized maps of the Birmingham Canal Navigations, her fingers tracing the faded blue lines that represented the waterways that were the Mourner’s hunting ground. She cross-referenced them with industrial ledgers from the mid-nineteenth century, her eyes scanning endless columns of spidery copperplate script detailing suppliers for locks, bridges, and towpath reinforcements.

It was in a leather-bound volume detailing the great canal expansion of the 1850s that she found it. A single entry, detailing the contract for the ironwork on the very series of locks near the derelict wharves. The components—the lock gates' balance beams, the paddle gear, the bracing plates—were all supplied by a single firm, celebrated in the ledger for the superior quality and fire-wrought strength of its castings. The name of the company leaped from the page, charged with a sudden, electrifying significance: 'The Etna Iron & Steel Company'. Etna. A volcano, a mountain of fire, the ultimate expression of the earth's molten, creative fury. A name that promised not the quenching of water, but its violent conversion into steam. A dry, terrestrial heat to counter a cold, consuming damp. It was a name of power, a name of making, not unmaking. *A name the water fears.* Esme copied it down onto a scrap of paper, the simple act of writing it feeling like the forging of a weapon.

The next component was less tangible. A "fire of memory" couldn't be found in a ledger. It had to be gathered. She left the quiet archives and spent the rest of the day walking the city, but with a new purpose. She stood outside the Molineux stadium, closing her eyes and breathing in the lingering psychic residue of a hundred thousand roars of triumph and groans of despair. She wandered through the bustling market, immersing herself in the chaotic, vibrant energy of commerce and gossip, the countless small, loud moments of human connection. It was a psychic collage of the city’s spirit—the stubborn pride, the gallows humour, the sheer, bloody-minded endurance of a place built on heavy labour and hard-won joys. She wasn't siphoning it or storing it, but attuning herself to it, weaving its resonant threads into the fabric of her own will. She was building a hearth inside herself, banking the embers of a million lives lived loudly and defiantly, preparing to turn it into a blaze.

As dusk began to settle, casting long shadows from the city’s Victorian architecture, she sought out the final piece of the puzzle. The archives had given her the location of a disused railway viaduct, an Etna Steel construction, that spanned the canal a half-mile upstream from the wharves. It was a skeletal relic of the industrial age, its massive brick pillars supporting a lattice of colossal iron girders, black with a century of soot and oxidized by the perpetual Midlands damp. It was a monument to a forgotten song of progress, and it was here she had to learn the tune. She walked out onto the centre of the viaduct, the drop to the dark, sullen water below a dizzying fall. The air was cold, and the silence here was a natural one, punctuated by the distant drone of the ring road.

From her toolkit, she pulled an object that was both new and ancient in its purpose: a large, C-128 steel tuning fork, its tines thick and heavy. It felt cold and solid in her hand, a thing of pure tone and physical law. This was not a tool for speaking to spirits, but for speaking to structure. She pressed the base of the fork firmly against the pitted, cold surface of one of the main load-bearing girders, a slab of iron as thick as her body. She closed her eyes, focusing her intent, that fire of memory she had gathered roaring to life within her. She was not asking the girder to speak. She was asking to listen. Then, with a small rubber mallet, she struck one of the tines. A deep, pure hum filled the air, but it was the vibration under her hand that mattered. It sank into the iron, and for a heart-stopping second, there was nothing. Then, a response. It wasn't a sound her ears could hear, but a profound, resonant thrum that travelled up her arm and vibrated deep in her bones. It was a chord of immense, patient power; the song of a million tons of pressure borne without complaint, of summer heat and winter frost, of the rattling thunder of a thousand long-dead steam trains. It was the song of endurance, the anthem of iron, the absolute antithesis of the Mourner's entropic silence. Esme stood on the bridge as the last of the light faded, the girder’s deep, slow song vibrating through her, the fiery name etched in her mind, and the memory of a city roaring in her soul. She had her lock. She had her key. Now she just had to build the fire.The walk back to the wharves was a different kind of journey. She was no longer a hunter tracking a predator, nor prey fleeing its grasp. She felt like a sapper, a demolition expert, walking towards a live bomb with the codes for its defusal etched not onto a circuit board but into the very marrow of her bones. The city’s noise, which she had so desperately clung to before, now felt like a cloak, a mantle of power she wore against the coming cold. As she drew nearer to the canal basin, she could feel the silence reaching for her, a tide of nothingness seeking to erode the shores of her newfound resolve. This time, however, it found her a shore of iron and stone. She felt the deep, patient song of the girder vibrating within her, a bass note of pure endurance that the hungry void could not digest. She was a bell, just as the Mourner had said, but tonight she would not be silenced. Tonight she was tolling for a storm.

She slid through the gap in the warehouse door and was met with a cold so profound it was a physical impact, a solid wall of absolute zero. The space within was darker, the null-field stronger, more concentrated, as if the Mourner had drawn all its power here in anticipation of her return. At the far end of the cavernous room, by the crumbled edge of the canal, the pillar of shadow waited. It was even less distinct than before, a human-shaped hole cut from the fabric of reality, and the circle of unmade objects at its feet seemed to have shrunk, their forms more withered, more consumed. The voice, when it came, was colder and flatter than ever, a perfect absence of tone.

“The little bell returns,” it whispered in her mind. “But you have learned a new song. It is… heavy. Grating. Full of the dirt of the world. Did you think to frighten me with the noise of rust and stone?”

A flicker of what could almost be described as amusement rippled through the Mourner’s presence. It was the detached curiosity of a scientist observing a particularly energetic but doomed bacterium under a microscope. “It makes no difference. A complex noise is still just a noise. It will make your silencing all the more satisfying. It will be a vintage of quiet I have not tasted before.”

“I didn't come back to be silenced,” Esme said, her own voice, raw and real, a shocking intrusion into the dead air. “I came to remind you what a noise sounds like.”

She pulled the heavy steel tuning fork from her pocket. The Mourner’s form rippled slightly, mistaking it for a conventional weapon. Esme ignored it. Holding the fork aloft, she drew a deep breath, and struck its tine with her knuckle. It was not the sharp, clinical ping she expected. Instead, amplified by her will and the resonant frequency she now held within her, the sound that bloomed in the warehouse was the deep, seismic hum of the viaduct. It was a chord of impossible weight and pressure, the sound of iron enduring a thousand winters, a thrumming, structural groan that spoke of foundations and stress and immovable mass. The crushing silence of the Lacuna didn't absorb it; the sound was too solid, too real. The silence fractured around it like brittle glass, and the very air in the warehouse began to shudder.

The Mourner recoiled, a physical jolt of dislocation. The smooth, grinding stone sound from their first encounter returned, a hundred times louder, a sound of agony and friction. “What is this?” the voice in her head shrieked, losing its placid emptiness and taking on a sharp, serrated edge of panic. “This noise… it has weight! It is… old!”

This was the opening she needed. Before the creature could recover or adapt, Esme threw open the floodgates of her mind. She unleashed the fire of memory she had so carefully gathered, not as a gentle warmth but as a psychic conflagration. The defiant roar of seventy thousand fans at a last-minute goal, the sharp hiss of a welder’s torch in a Tipton factory, the cacophony of a thousand arguments and reconciliations over garden fences in Penn, the bitter laughter in a pub, a mother’s lullaby in a terraced house in Bilston—she hurled it all, a chaotic, vibrant, overwhelming tsunami of lived experience, directly at the void.

The effect was immediate and catastrophic. The Mourner staggered back as if she’d thrown a bucket of acid. Its form, which had been a stable patch of darkness, began to writhe and contort. The memories it had consumed, the lives it had unmade, were being violently regurgitated. Ghostly, half-formed images flickered in the air around it: a faint, shimmering goldfish swam through the air for a second before dissolving; the distorted, tinny melody of a music box played a single, jarring bar; the scent of old paper and lost love filled the air. The creature was not just a hole, Esme realised; it was a container, and she was over-filling it. It was being poisoned by a surfeit of existence, force-fed the rich, messy, beautiful noise it had sought to erase.

“Stop it!” the voice screeched, no longer a whisper in her mind but a raw, physical sound that tore at the air. “Too loud! It is all too loud!”

Esme stood her ground, the girder’s song a constant, foundational hum beneath the chaotic blaze of her mental assault. She gathered all her remaining strength, all the iron and fire she had collected, and focused it on a single, explosive point. This was the key. This was the final blow. She took a deep, shuddering breath, and projected the name not with her larynx, but with the full, incandescent force of her will, shaping the sound with the resonance of the girder and the heat of the memory-fire.

“ETNA!”

The word did not echo. It detonated. It was the sound of a volcano’s heart, of a blast furnace being thrown open, of creation itself as a violent act. The warehouse was illuminated by a flash of searing, orange light that seemed to erupt from Esme herself. The Mourner let out a final, piercing scream—a sound of pure, fundamental opposition, of water turning to steam on white-hot iron. The shifting black scales on its coat blazed for a moment like burning magnesium, revealing a thousand tiny crescents of absolute nothingness, before they, and the form they covered, imploded. There was a violent rush of displaced air and a cascade of impossibly cold, brackish water that surged across the concrete floor before being sucked backwards with a sickening gulp, vanishing out through the crumbled wall and into the waiting canal.

Then, there was silence. But it was a different silence. A natural silence, filled with the drip of water from the ceiling and the distant hum of the city. The soul-crushing cold was gone, replaced by the simple, honest chill of a damp November night. Esme fell to her knees, every muscle in her body screaming in protest, her mind feeling scoured and empty, but it was her own emptiness, the emptiness of effort and exhaustion, not of erasure. She looked over at the circle of objects on the floor. The tarnished silver of the music box seemed to catch the faint moonlight. The teddy bear, slumped and worn, looked less like a husk and more like a beloved old toy waiting for a child to pick it up. They were not whole. They had not been restored. But they were no longer unmade. They were simply broken. And broken things, Esme thought, a flicker of her old self igniting in the hollow of her chest, broken things could be fixed.The walk back through the sleeping streets of Wolverhampton was a slow, aching pilgrimage. Each step was a conscious effort, a negotiation between screaming muscles and stubborn will. The world, which only hours before had seemed muted and threatened, now felt almost deafeningly alive. The rumble of a late-night lorry on the ring road was a bass note in the girder’s song; the rustle of a discarded newspaper in a gutter was a percussive whisper of story; the orange glow of the streetlights felt warm and protective, a thousand tiny bonfires holding back the dark. Esme carried her spoils in a canvas tote bag she’d found in the warehouse office, its faded logo for a long-defunct brand of industrial solvent a fitting container for her strange cargo. The music box, the diary, and the teddy bear. They clinked and rustled softly with each pained step, a collection of broken ghosts she was escorting home.

She didn't feel triumphant. The fiery, incandescent rage she had channelled was gone, leaving behind a hollow ache and a mind scoured clean. The foundational magic she had wielded was a blunt and brutal instrument. It was like performing surgery with a sledgehammer; the cancer was gone, but the patient was left bruised, battered, and bleeding. Her own magical senses, usually a fine and delicate web for detecting resonances, felt clumsy and numb, as if she’d been listening to a symphony and then been deafened by a cannon blast. The silence in her own head was nearly as profound as the one she had fought, and it was deeply unsettling.

Back in her flat, the familiar clutter felt like a welcoming embrace. She bolted the door and leaned against it, the cheap tote bag a heavy weight against her leg. She limped into the kitchen and carefully, reverently, unpacked her salvage onto the pine table. The teddy bear slumped over, its button eyes seeming to hold a faint, questioning sadness instead of a blank void. The silver music box glinted under the fluorescent light, its intricate carvings no longer looking like meaningless scratches. The diary lay closed, a silent invitation. They were a pathetic, damaged collection, but they were *present*. They had substance again. They had weight. They occupied space in a way they hadn’t before.

Ignoring them for a moment, Esme moved on autopilot, her body craving the simple, grounding ritual of tea. As she filled the kettle, she caught her reflection in the dark glass of the microwave. She looked like a ghost herself—her face pale and smudged with grime, her dark hair a tangled mess, and her eyes, usually the colour of strong tea, were dark and wide, reflecting a deep, bone-wearying exhaustion. When the kettle boiled, the sudden, shrill whistle made her jump so violently she almost dropped the pot. The world was still too loud, or she was still too raw for it.

With a steaming mug clutched in both hands, she returned to the table and finally allowed herself to properly examine the aftermath. She nudged the teddy bear, and the lingering affection of a long-dead child was a faint, whisper-thin echo, like a song heard from a distant room. It was a start. She ran a finger over the cover of the diary. The feeling of un-language was gone, but the stories within felt jumbled, fractured, like a book whose pages had been torn out and stuffed back in the wrong order. The music box was the same; she could feel the ghost of a melody trapped within it, but it was shattered into a thousand glittering, discordant shards of sound. They were broken, yes, but they were no longer nothing. They were fixable. The thought brought not a surge of energy, but a deep, quiet sense of purpose. This was a new kind of work. Not de-haunting, but re-weaving.

Her eyes were drawn back to the goldfish bowl she had taken from Arthur Pumble’s house, which she had left on her counter. It was still bone-dry, sterile. She had poured so much into the fight, but she hadn’t once thought of Sir Reginald. A pang of guilt, sharp and unwelcome, cut through her exhaustion. Had he been too small, his magic too delicate to survive the violent regurgitation she had forced? She picked up the bowl, her heart sinking. But as she turned it in the light, she saw something that hadn’t been there before. Nestled in the curve where the glass bottom met the side, was a single, perfect sphere. It was no bigger than a pea, milky white and shot through with faint, shimmering threads of orange and gold. It was a pearl. But unlike the cold, dead pearls Tariq had described, this one radiated a faint, gentle warmth.

Carefully, she tipped the bowl until the pearl rolled into her palm. As soon as it touched her skin, a single, clear image bloomed in her mind: a view from a high shelf, looking down on a kindly, grey-haired man as he worriedly stirred a cup of tea. It was a perfect, crystalline memory. The Mourner hadn't just been a void; it was a collector. In its destruction, it had compressed what it had consumed. This pearl wasn't a seed of nothingness like the black scale; it was a repository of captured life, a single, perfect drop of Sir Reginald’s existence, his perspective, his magic. A flicker of hope, the first she had felt in hours, ignited within her. Maybe, just maybe, she could even fix this. It would take more than a nursery rhyme and a modified USB stick. It would take time, patience, and a kind of gentle, intricate magic she hadn't practiced in a very long time. It was the work of a restorer, not a brawler. And as she curled her fingers around the warm, living pearl, she knew that was a change she was willing to make. The Mourner had shown her the limits of her power, but in defeating it, she had discovered a whole new continent of it she had yet to explore. The fixer’s work was never truly done; it just got stranger.Sleep did not come for Esme, but a deep, grey exhaustion eventually dragged her under. She woke slumped on her sofa, still fully dressed, with the stiff, aching cold of the early morning settled deep in her bones. The watery Wolverhampton sun was making a valiant but failing effort to pierce the gloom outside her window, and the light felt like a physical intrusion, sharp and unwelcome against her eyelids. The first bus of the day hissed past below, and the sound was an abrasive roar, a cacophony of hydraulics and diesel engine that grated on her nerves. Her magical senses, usually a fine-tuned instrument, were a wreck. The familiar hums and vibrations of the city were gone, replaced by a dull, buzzing numbness, as if her head were wrapped in a thick layer of felt. The fight with the Mourner had not just been a victory; it had been an overload, a psychic detonation that had blown all her own fuses.

She pushed herself upright with a groan, her joints protesting. The flat was a mess, a testament to a night of metaphysical warfare. Her gaze fell on the kitchen table, which now resembled an infirmary for broken souls. The sad, slumped teddy bear, the silent music box, the jumbled diary. They were her responsibility now. Her eyes settled on the simple glass bowl where the single, luminescent pearl rested. In the muted landscape of her own senses, it was the only thing that felt clear, a tiny, self-contained point of warmth and light. This was where she had to start. Not with the grand, shattered objects, but with this one, perfect, captured moment of life.

She decided against her usual tools. Salt and iron felt too harsh, too aggressive for this delicate work. Instead, she filled a clean porcelain bowl—one of the good ones her nan had left her—with fresh, filtered water. It felt like a deliberate act of cleansing, a rebuttal to the foul, stagnant water of the canal. She placed the bowl on the table and set the pearl gently into the centre. It sank to the bottom, its milky lustre seeming to gather the faint morning light to itself. For a long time, nothing happened. Esme simply sat, cradling a fresh mug of tea, and watched it, pouring not her will or her power, but simply her focused, patient attention onto the tiny sphere. It was an act of quiet observation, of bearing witness. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, a change began. The water around the pearl did not cloud, but it seemed to thicken, taking on a subtle, lens-like quality. The image that had flashed in her mind before began to coalesce within the bowl, no longer a fleeting mental picture but a stable, shimmering diorama. She could see Mr. Pumble’s study in miniature, the mahogany desk, the rows of books, the window looking out onto a rain-slicked lawn. The vision sharpened, and this time it brought other senses with it: the faint, sweet-acrid scent of old pipe tobacco, the gentle ticking of a mantelpiece clock, a feeling of peaceful, domestic contentment. It was Sir Reginald’s world. She was not just seeing his memory; she was feeling his existence. The effort was immense, a delicate drain on her already depleted reserves, but it was a victory. It was the first stitch in a tapestry she would have to re-weave from a single, salvaged thread.

The phone call to Arthur Pumble was a conversation she both craved and dreaded. She found his number scrawled on the back of a takeaway menu and dialled, her heart thumping a nervous rhythm. His voice, when he answered, was frail and tinged with a hope so fragile she was terrified of breaking it. She took a deep breath. “Mr. Pumble, it’s Esme Blackwood. I have… well, it’s complicated. But I have news about Sir Reginald.” She explained as best she could, stripping away the cosmic horror and focusing on the tangible. She told him his fish’s magic had been stolen, but that she had managed to recover its essence, its memory, in a new form. She described the pearl, the vision in the water. To her surprise, Mr. Pumble didn’t sound confused or disbelieving. There was a long silence on the line, and then a soft, wet sniffle. “He was always a tough little chap,” he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. “Of course he’d find a way to hold on. Is he… can he come home?” The simple, trusting question landed like a physical weight in Esme’s chest. This was no longer just a magical curiosity; it was a promise to a grieving man. “Not yet,” she said, her voice softer than she intended. “He needs to… recuperate. But I’m looking after him. I will bring him home when he’s ready.”

After the call, a new and heavier sense of responsibility settled over her. She turned her attention to the other casualties. She picked up the tarnished silver music box, its silence no longer a terrifying void but a complex, frustrating puzzle. Closing her eyes, she tried to listen with her blunted senses, not for a melody but for the broken pieces of it. It was like trying to hear the shape of shattered glass. Faint, disconnected images brushed against her mind: the bright, laughing face of a young girl at a birthday party, the sight of two wrinkled hands clasped together in a slow dance, a moment of quiet solace as someone sat by a window on a snowy afternoon. The box didn't just hold a tune; it held every moment that tune had ever been the soundtrack to. Its magic was a collage of emotions and memories, and the Mourner had ripped it to confetti. Reassembling it would be the work of a master historian and a jeweller combined. Each object, she realised, would demand a different kind of mending. The diary would need the narrative threads untangled and re-spooled. The bear would need its reservoir of affection to be slowly, carefully refilled.

Her exhaustion finally drove her towards her laptop, intending to email Kevin the graphic designer that his phone was fixed and his invoice was on its way. It was a comforting slice of her old, simple life. She plugged The Exorcist into its USB port out of habit. The ancient machine whirred, but the familiar black command window did not appear. Instead, her screen went dark, and then a single shape bloomed in the centre: a perfect, black circle on a field of static grey. It didn't flash or flicker. It was utterly still, and it seemed to absorb the light from the room. A low, bass hum, deeper than the girder’s song, vibrated not from the speakers, but seemingly from the air around the laptop itself. She snatched her hand back as if burned. The Exorcist was no longer an exorcist. Her desperate gambit, her feedback loop of nothingness, hadn't just deflected the Mourner; it had turned her tool into a portable piece of its nature. She had captured a shard of the void. It was a weapon of terrifying potential, a controlled silence she could now, theoretically, deploy. And she had absolutely no idea how it worked or what it might do to her if she tried to use it again.

She shut the laptop, her hands trembling slightly. She looked from the dark, humming screen to the collection of broken things on her kitchen table. The pearl glowing softly in its bowl of water, the silent music box, the sad, slumped bear. A hospital, a prison, an armoury. Her small, cluttered flat had become all three. The world had cracked open and shown her something vast and terrible, and in surviving, she had been irrevocably changed. Her work was no longer about quick fixes and cash in hand. It was about slow, patient restoration. It was about safeguarding the fragile, noisy, beautiful things of the world against the silence that was always waiting at the edges. A profound weariness washed over her, so deep it felt geological. But beneath it, a tiny, stubborn seed of resolve began to sprout. This was her city, her mess to clean up. The fixer’s work was done. The restorer’s work was just beginning.Three weeks passed. The city of Wolverhampton carried on, oblivious, healing its rain-slicked streets with the indifferent balm of routine. But in the third-floor flat above the vape shop, time had taken on a new texture. Esme’s life, once a series of sharp, punctuated crises, had flattened into a long, quiet, and arduous convalescence. The world outside her windows was too loud, too sharp. The roar of a motorbike, the shriek of a playground, the overlapping chatter of a crowd—they were no longer just background noise, but physical assaults on her frayed magical senses. She took to wearing noise-cancelling headphones on her rare trips for milk and bread, her world reduced to a muffled, distant hum. Her flat became her world, a hushed sanctuary where the only sounds were the gentle click of the radiator and the whisper of turning pages. The two hundred quid from the data-wraith case was long gone, and the overdue notices, no longer just for library books, began to pile up by the door like fallen leaves.

Her days were spent in painstaking, meditative labour. She would sit for hours with the broken teddy bear, her fingers gently smoothing its matted fur. She wasn’t casting spells or chanting incantations. Instead, she spoke to it, her voice low and even, telling it stories from her own childhood, humming the half-remembered nonsense rhymes her nan used to sing. She was trying to feed it, to transfuse it with her own memories and affection, hoping to coax the faint, residual echo of a child’s love back to the surface. Some days she felt a flicker of success, a subtle shift in the bear’s slumped posture or a fleeting sensation of warmth against her palm. Other days, it was just a sack of old stuffing, and the sheer, exhausting futility of her task would threaten to crush her. The music box and the diary sat on a shelf, their more complex fractures a challenge for which she had not yet mustered the strength. Her focus remained on the two simplest, most fundamental patients: the bear who needed love, and the fish who needed a world.

The knock on her door, when it came, was so quiet she almost missed it. It was not the frantic rapping of a desperate man or the sharp, insistent knock of a bailiff. It was a hesitant, apologetic tapping, a sound that seemed ready to retreat at the slightest sign of hostility. With a weary sigh, Esme unravelled herself from the sofa, where she’d been staring into the porcelain bowl on her coffee table. Inside, the world of Sir Reginald had grown a little clearer; she could now make out the pattern on Mr. Pumble’s favourite armchair. She peered through the spyhole to see a young woman, maybe early twenties, twisting the strap of her shoulder bag, her expression one of quiet, gnawing anxiety. Client o’clock, then. She felt a profound wave of reluctance. She had nothing to offer, no quick fixes or flashy exorcisms. She was a broken instrument herself.

She opened the door, and the young woman, who introduced herself as Chloe, flinched as if expecting a shout. She was a student at the university, she explained, her voice barely above a whisper. Her problem wasn't a ghost or a curse. It was her grandmother's wedding ring. She held it out on the flat of her palm. It was a simple, worn gold band, utterly unremarkable. “It’s… fading,” Chloe said, the word sounding inadequate and strange. “My gran passed away five years ago. We all used to hold this ring and tell stories about her and grandad. We could… feel them. You know? Their whole life together. But now…” She trailed off, her eyes welling up. “Now when we hold it, there’s almost nothing. The stories are getting harder to remember. My mum couldn't even recall my grandad's middle name yesterday. It’s like she, like they, are being erased.”

Esme took the ring, her hand closing around the thin circle of gold. It was a familiar gesture, the first step in a diagnostic process she knew by heart. She reached out with her senses, expecting to feel the signature of a curse or the residue of a hostile entity. But there was nothing like that. The abrasiveness she now felt from most magical objects was absent. Instead, there was a profound and terrifying stillness. The deep, resonant chord of a sixty-year marriage, a chord that should have been humming with love, laughter, arguments, and forgiveness, was barely a whisper. It wasn’t being silenced by an active force; it was simply unravelling, its threads thinning into nothing. It was the magical equivalent of entropy.

A cold dread, entirely separate from her own exhaustion, settled in Esme’s stomach. This was the Mourner’s legacy. It hadn't just consumed the objects in its path; its very passage through the world had created a wake of decay, a subtle corrosion of meaning that was now slowly and silently spreading. It was an aftershock, weakening the resonant foundations of countless other objects it had merely passed by. The Lacuna was gone, but it had left behind a creeping plague of forgetting, a slow, quiet unmaking that was perhaps even more insidious than its direct consumption. This wasn't a haunting; it was a blight.

“Can you fix it?” Chloe asked, her voice trembling with a hope that felt like an accusation. “They said you were the one to see when things go… sideways.”

Esme looked from the fading ring in her hand to the broken things laid out in her flat. She thought of her own blunted senses, her exhaustion, the soul-deep weariness that clung to her like a shroud. Her old self, the confident fixer with a snappy solution for every problem, was gone. She was in no state to take on a single new case, let alone fight a creeping metaphysical plague. But then she looked at the bowl on her coffee table, at the tiny, perfect world she was coaxing back into existence, drop by patient drop. She looked at the teddy bear, which she was sure was sitting up just a fraction straighter than it had been yesterday. The old magic of flash and bang was useless here. But this new, slow, difficult work… this quiet, stubborn act of mending… it was the only thing that stood a chance.

“I don’t know,” Esme said, her honesty raw and unvarnished. “I’ve never tried to fix something like this before. It will be slow. And it might not work.” She met the young woman’s desperate gaze, and in that moment, she felt the first true flicker of her old purpose, changed and tempered by fire and silence. “But I can try.” She closed her hand around the ring, its faint, dying warmth a fragile promise. For the first time in weeks, she wasn't just tending to the past; she was accepting a new future. Her work wasn’t just about cleaning up the mess the Mourner had left behind. It was about teaching the world how to remember.Chloe left, leaving behind the worn gold band on Esme’s kitchen table and a silence thick with the weight of her fragile hope. Esme stood for a long time, just staring at the ring. It sat next to the porcelain bowl where Sir Reginald’s world was slowly taking shape, looking inert and profoundly sad. It was a problem so quiet, so passive, it felt impossible to get a grip on. Her old instincts were screaming at her to perform a diagnostic, to taste its magical signature, to find the frequency of the thing that was wrong with it. She picked up the ring, closed her eyes, and tried. The result was uniquely awful. Reaching for a resonance that was actively unravelling was like trying to drink from a river that was evaporating as it flowed. There was no hostile presence to fight, no knot to untangle; there was just a profound sense of thinning, of a story being turned to dust and blown away on a wind she couldn't feel. The effort left a bitter, metallic taste in her mouth and a sharp, stabbing pain behind her eyes, the psychic equivalent of feedback from a broken speaker.

She dropped the ring back on the table as if it were hot. The old ways were not just useless; they were actively harmful to her already damaged senses. This blight didn't need to be fought; it needed to be outlasted. It didn’t need an exorcist; it needed an archivist. The problem wasn’t that the ring was haunted; it was that it was suffering from amnesia. The solution, if there was one, lay not in banishing something, but in rebuilding it from the ground up. She looked at the teddy bear, to which she had spent the morning murmuring the plot of a half-remembered cartoon from her childhood. She looked at the pearl, into which she had been pouring her focus and the ambient warmth of her flat. It was a slow, painstaking process of transfusion, of offering up energy and memory in the hope that the damaged object could learn to hold them again. The ring would require the same, but she didn’t have the source material. The stories belonged to Chloe’s family.

After a day of wrestling with the problem, of pacing her small flat and drinking endless cups of cooling tea, she called Chloe. The conversation was one of the strangest she’d ever had with a client. She dispensed with the usual mystique of her trade, the vague pronouncements and air of professional competence. Her exhaustion was too profound for pretence. “I can’t fix this on my own,” she said, her voice flat. “The magic of this ring is… it’s the story of your grandparents. I don’t know that story. You do. Your family does. I need you to bring it here.” There was a confused silence on the other end of the line. “Bring the story?” Chloe asked. “I need you,” Esme clarified, rubbing her aching temples. “And your mother. Or anyone else who remembers them well. I need you to come to my flat. And I need you to talk about them. That’s the work. The only way to fight this forgetting is with active, deliberate remembering.” It sounded insane, even to her own ears. It was less a magical ritual and more a group therapy session for a piece of jewellery. To her immense surprise, after a brief, whispered consultation with someone in the background, Chloe agreed.

Two days later, they arrived. Chloe and her mother, a woman named Sharon, stood awkwardly in Esme’s doorway, clutching their coats and looking deeply uncomfortable. The flat, which was Esme’s sanctuary, must have looked to them like the den of a slightly unhinged hoarder. The pile of overdue notices by the door, the precarious stacks of books, the general air of dusty neglect. Sharon’s eyes lingered on the objects laid out on the kitchen table as if it were a dubious operating theatre. Esme offered them tea, a gesture of normalcy that felt utterly absurd under the circumstances. They sat around the small table, the three of them, with the thin gold band placed in the centre on a clean, white saucer. The silence was thick with expectation and doubt. “So… we just talk?” Sharon asked, her voice betraying a deep scepticism.

Esme nodded, leaning forward. “Tell me about the day they met,” she prompted, her voice quiet. This was the most delicate part. She couldn’t force it. She could only create the space and hope they could fill it. Chloe and Sharon exchanged a glance. “Well,” Sharon began, hesitantly. “Mum always said she saw him from across the dance hall. He was a terrible dancer, she said. All elbows and knees.” She smiled, a faint, watery expression. But the memory felt thin, a story told so many times it had lost its texture. Esme could feel it, a flicker of resonance that died almost as soon as it appeared. The ring remained cold. They talked for nearly an hour, sharing the well-worn, canonical stories of the family lore: the disastrous first date, the proposal under the crooked apple tree, the wedding day itself. But the anecdotes were smooth and polished with retelling, lacking the specific, messy details where the real magic, the real memory, was stored. The blight was working insidiously, not by erasing the headlines of a life, but by sanding away the footnotes, leaving behind a story without substance. The atmosphere in the room grew heavier, freighted with the frustration and sadness of their own failing memories.

Esme knew it wasn't working. She needed an anchor, something to disrupt the smooth flow of forgetting. Her eyes fell upon the tarnished silver music box on the shelf. It was a desperate, intuitive leap. She rose, retrieved it, and placed it on the table beside the ring. She didn’t try to open it or wind it. She just let it sit there, another broken thing in their midst. “What’s that?” Chloe asked. “Something I’m working on,” Esme said. “It lost its song.” She gently touched the lid of the box, focusing not on its brokenness, but on the echo of the emotions it once held—the joy, the love, the solace. She tried to create a sympathetic resonance, a space where lost things could be found. “Your grandfather,” she said, turning back to Sharon, her voice gaining a new, quiet authority. “Forget the big stories. What did he sound like when he laughed?”

The question hung in the air. Sharon’s brow furrowed in concentration. The usual, easy answer didn’t come. She was digging deeper now, past the polished anecdotes. “It wasn’t a big laugh,” she said slowly, her gaze distant. “It was… a rumble. A quiet sort of rumble, deep in his chest. You’d feel it more than hear it if you were standing next to him. And he’d always… he’d always tap his pipe on the heel of his shoe afterwards. Three sharp taps. *Tap. Tap. Tap.*” As she spoke, a genuine, textured memory surfaced. For the first time, a real scent filled the room, faint but unmistakable: old books, sweet cherry tobacco, and wool. It was a complex, personal, living memory. At the same moment, the gold band on the saucer pulsed with a soft, warm light, just for a second, a single beat of a golden heart. Chloe gasped. Esme felt a wave of dizziness, the effort of creating the resonant field and channelling their memory taking a sharp, physical toll. But it had worked. They had found a thread. It was a start. The long, slow work of re-weaving had begun.The sessions became a ritual, a quiet constant in the chaotic thrum of the weeks that followed. Twice a week, Chloe and Sharon would arrive, no longer with the air of nervous supplicants, but with a sense of purpose, carrying flasks of hot tea and Tupperware containers filled with stew or shepherd's pie. They understood, without Esme ever having to say it, that the work drained her not just magically, but physically, and their offerings were a practical, earthy form of payment that felt more meaningful than any transfer of funds. They would settle around the kitchen table, the gold ring glowing with a faint, expectant warmth on its saucer, and they would begin the slow, arduous work of excavation.

Esme, in turn, learned to be a new kind of practitioner. She was less a magical mechanic and more a conductor of memories. She learned to create a specific kind of quiet in her flat, a receptive silence that gently pushed back against the encroaching void and gave their stories room to breathe. She prompted them with questions that bypassed the polished surfaces of anecdote and aimed for the messy, vibrant core. “Don’t tell me they were happy,” she’d murmur, her own voice low and thin. “Tell me about a time they had a terrible argument. What did they break? What did the silence feel like afterwards?” And Sharon, her initial scepticism long since replaced by a fierce determination, would dredge up the memory of a shattered porcelain dog and a week of terse, whispered conversations, and the ring would flicker with a complex, discordant light of anger and reconciliation. They rebuilt the love story not just from its highlights, but from its fractures, its scars, and its stubborn, difficult repairs. With each session, the ring grew stronger. Its warm light would hold for longer, and the scent of cherry tobacco and old wool would linger in the flat for hours afterwards, a friendly ghost invited in for tea.

The work, while focused, was not contained. The concentrated, ambient magic of remembering began to bleed into the other broken things in the flat. One evening, after a particularly draining session where Chloe had tearfully recounted a memory of her grandfather teaching her to tie her shoelaces, Esme was tidying away the mugs when her hand brushed against the silver music box. She flinched, expecting the familiar, frustrating silence. Instead, a single, perfect note hung in the air. It was a high, crystalline C, pure and clear as winter ice. It lasted only for a second before fading, but it was the first sound the box had made since the Mourner had unmade it. Esme froze, her heart hammering in her chest. It was a breakthrough, a cascade of healing sparked by a borrowed memory. The stories they were telling the ring were also teaching the music box how to sing again. Hope, a feeling she had almost forgotten, bloomed fragile and bright in the quiet of her kitchen.

The small victory gave her the courage to venture outside. Her rent was due, and the last of Sharon’s stew was gone. She needed to brave the world, to visit a cash machine. For the first time, she left her noise-cancelling headphones on the table, wanting to test her own recovery. The street was a jarring cacophony. The screech of brakes, the distant wail of a siren, the overlapping shouts of a group of teenagers—it was all sharp edges and painful frequencies. But beneath the initial assault, she could feel the city’s familiar hum, faint and battered but still there, like a baseline she could just about make out. As she walked through St. Peter's Gardens, she took a route that led her past a large, bronze statue of a stern-looking Victorian industrialist, a man who had built half the foundries in the nineteenth century. She’d passed it a thousand times. The man’s name, Sir Joseph Baines, was emblazoned on a polished brass plaque at the statue’s base.

Today, something was wrong. The usual crowd of pigeons was absent, and people flowed around the statue’s plinth without a glance, their paths diverting as if around an inconvenient rock rather than a piece of civic history. A strange apathy hung in the air. Esme drew closer, a familiar cold dread coiling in her gut. The plaque was tarnished, its usual gleam gone, but that wasn't it. She squinted, focusing. The letters themselves seemed… unstable. The crisp edges of the name ‘J-O-S-E-P-H’ were blurred, the lines seeming to waver as if seen through heat haze. It wasn't physical corrosion. She reached out, extending her blunted senses, and felt the same entropic thinning she had felt from Chloe’s ring. The Blight was here. It was feeding on public memory, on shared history. It was erasing the city’s story from the city itself. People were forgetting Sir Joseph Baines existed even as they walked past his monument. They weren’t choosing to ignore it; they were becoming incapable of seeing it.

She stumbled back from the statue, the scale of the problem crashing down on her with the force of a physical blow. Her work, her slow, painstaking restoration of a handful of personal objects, felt pitifully small, like trying to patch a collapsing dam with a single strip of tape. She was a conservator in a library whose every book was simultaneously beginning to crumble into dust. How could she possibly conduct a therapy session for a 30-foot bronze statue? How could she gather the collective, forgotten memories of millions to save a landmark? She returned to her flat in a daze, the noise of the city once again a meaningless, hostile roar. The comfort she had felt from the music box’s single, perfect note was gone, replaced by a vast and terrifying sense of inadequacy. She sank onto her sofa, her gaze falling on the sleek, black laptop sitting on her bookshelf. It was closed, silent, unplugged. But she could feel it, even from across the room. A point of absolute, focused silence in a world that was slowly being consumed by a passive, creeping one. The thought was horrifying, a heresy against everything her new work stood for. But it was there, undeniable and insistent. You can’t fight a plague of silence with a whisper. But perhaps, just perhaps, you could fight it with a scalpel made of void.The laptop remained on the shelf for two days, a dark monolith radiating a quiet, profound wrongness that soured the air in the flat. Esme found her gaze drawn to it constantly. It was a stark and terrifying counterpoint to the slow, gentle work she was doing at her kitchen table. Her sessions with Chloe and Sharon were acts of generation, of weaving memory and meaning back into existence thread by painstaking thread. The laptop represented the opposite. It was a tool of absolute subtraction. The idea of opening it, of willingly inviting that concentrated void back into her sanctuary, felt like a betrayal of the fragile healing taking place within its walls. Yet, the wavering letters on the statue’s plaque haunted her thoughts. The slow, quiet unmaking of her city was a problem she could not solve with gentle stories and cups of tea. Her new magic was the magic of a kintsugi artist, lovingly repairing a single treasured bowl, while outside the entire pottery was turning to sand.

On the third day, she could bear the indecision no longer. After Chloe and Sharon had left, leaving behind the scent of remembered love and beef casserole, Esme took a deep, steadying breath and retrieved the laptop. It felt heavier than it should, its plastic and metal housing imbued with a conceptual weight. She placed it on the table, a stark black rectangle amidst the gentle clutter of her restoration projects. The humming started the moment she opened the lid, a sub-audible frequency that vibrated not in her ears but in the fillings of her teeth and the hollow spaces of her bones. The screen lit up, not with a boot sequence, but with the immediate, silent image: a perfect black circle on a field of digital static, like a hole punched through the screen into a deeper, more absolute darkness. There was no cursor, no command prompt. It was not a program to be run, but a state to be observed. It was a chained abyss.

She reached out, her fingers hesitating inches from the trackpad. She had no idea what to do. Her last interaction had been an instinctive act of psychic violence. Now, she needed control. She needed to understand the grammar of this terrible new tool. Closing her eyes, she didn't try to read its resonance—a mistake she wouldn’t make twice. Instead, she remembered the Mourner. She remembered its nature as a mimic, an echo. It reflected what it consumed. Perhaps this shard of it was the same. It was a mirror of nothingness. With that thought, she placed her fingers on the trackpad and, instead of trying to move a cursor, she focused her will. She didn't push energy into the machine; she drew a line with her intent, a conceptual boundary around an imaginary shape on the screen. The black circle on the display rippled, and a smaller circle detached from it, floating free for a moment in the grey static before dissolving. The humming intensified, and a wave of intense cold washed over her, making the hairs on her arms stand on end. She snatched her hand back, her heart hammering. It was a scalpel. She could command it to cut, to excise, to isolate a piece of its own nothingness and apply it.

The potential was staggering and horrifying. She could, in theory, use it to cut the Blight away from an object, like a surgeon excising a tumour. But the risks were astronomical. What if she cut too deep and severed the object’s own lingering memories? What if the excised void didn't just vanish, but latched onto something else? Onto her? She looked at the fragile patients on her table—the ring, the bear, the music box. She would never risk them. She needed a test case, something so thoroughly lost to the Blight that any outcome, even total annihilation, was an improvement on its slow, inexorable slide into forgottenness. She needed to find a place where the city’s memory was at its thinnest, and for that, she needed an expert in the city’s secret weaknesses. She needed Tariq.

The Bosphorus Grill was an assault on her still-raw senses. The roar of the extractor fans, the hiss of lamb on the grill, the percussive chop of Tariq’s knife—it was a wall of noise and heat that made her flinch. Tariq looked up as she entered, his expression shifting from neutral commerce to one of deep concern. He took in her pale face, the slight tremor in her hands, the way she seemed to shrink from the noisy warmth of his establishment. He served his last customer and wordlessly flipped the sign on the door to ‘Closed’, gesturing her towards a small, grease-spattered table in the corner, away from the heat of the grill. He brought her not a kebab, but a small glass of strong, sweet mint tea, its clean, sharp scent a balm to her frayed nerves.

“You look like a ghost, Blackwood,” he rumbled, his voice low and devoid of its usual bombast. He sat opposite her, his large frame seeming to fill the small space. “I heard you went to the wharves. I told you to stay away.” His tone wasn't accusatory, but heavy with a weary, paternal disappointment. Esme wrapped her cold hands around the warm glass. “I dealt with it,” she said, her voice thin. “But it left something behind. A… rot. Things are forgetting themselves. The city is. And I…” She hesitated, knowing the next words would change everything between them. “I have a piece of it. The thing from the wharf. I took a piece of its power.” Tariq’s jovial facade vanished completely, replaced by a stony, primal fear she had only seen once before, when she had shown him the black scale. He physically recoiled, pushing his chair back a few inches. “You did *what*?” he whispered, the words laced with horrified disbelief. “Esme, no. That is not a power you can hold. It is a power that holds you. It is a hole. You cannot fill a hole with more hole. You will unmake yourself.”

“I have to try,” she insisted, leaning forward, the intensity of her desperation overriding the noise and the pain. “It’s the only tool I have that’s fast enough. I need to know where the Blight is worst. Where are the thin places, Tariq? Where is the memory of the city already so weak that I can try this without risking something precious?” He stared at her for a long, terrible moment, his dark eyes full of a fear that was not for himself, but for her. He saw not a fixer or a warrior, but a desperate woman considering a form of self-immolation to cauterize a larger wound. He ran a hand over his magnificent beard, the gesture one of profound resignation. “There are places,” he said, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “The old churchyards, where the names on the stones have been worn away by acid rain and time. The forgotten alleyways that have been bricked up at one end, places that no longer lead anywhere. Places that have lost their purpose.” He leaned closer, his voice barely audible over the hum of the cooling fryer. “But if you want the thinnest place of all… go to the terminus of the old Number 8 bus route. The stop at the edge of Wednesfield, where the houses give way to scrubland. The route was cancelled fifteen years ago. The bus shelter is still there, but no one has waited there for a bus that will never come in a generation. Its purpose is gone. Its story is over. It is a memory waiting for a final push into oblivion. If you are going to play with the fire that burns cold, Blackwood, go there. But do not come back to me when you find it has burned your soul to ash.”The bus journey to the edge of Wednesfield was a slow descent into grey. With each stop, the city shed a layer of its identity. The dense Victorian brickwork and noisy bustle of the centre gave way to the repetitive, anonymous estates of the post-war boom, which in turn dissolved into sparser, more uncertain territory where new-build cul-de-sacs petered out into scrubland and forgotten industrial plots. The psychic hum of the city, which Esme was just beginning to hear again as a coherent background noise, thinned out with the landscape. The vibrant, layered symphony of a million lives faded into a lonely, monophonic drone. She sat on the top deck, the laptop in a canvas bag on her lap. It felt not like a piece of electronics but like a cryogenic container holding a sliver of anti-life, its conceptual cold seeping through the fabric and chilling her to the bone. Every jolt of the bus was a reminder of the unstable power she carried, a chained void that strained against its digital prison. Tariq’s warning echoed in her mind, a grim counterpoint to the hiss of the bus’s air brakes. *You will unmake yourself.* She was crossing a line, leaving behind the known world of ghosts and curses for a new, terrifying cartography of absence and decay, and she was doing it with a map drawn by the enemy.

The final stop spat her out onto a wide, desolate road fringed by a ragged verge of weeds. Across the street, exactly as Tariq had described, was the bus shelter. It was a pathetic, lonely structure of rust-streaked metal and crazed, polycarbonate panels, half-swallowed by an aggressive bramble patch. A faded, peeling sticker on one panel declared ‘Wolverhampton: A City of Light’, a piece of civic optimism so out of place it felt like a cruel joke. The air here was thin and empty. The Blight was a palpable presence, but it had no malice. It was the feeling of a word on the tip of your tongue that you know you will never, ever remember. It was the psychic equivalent of a photograph left so long in the sun that the image has bleached away to nothing but a faint, chemical stain on the paper. The bus shelter was not just forgotten; it was actively forgetting itself, its own physical form seeming to lose its conviction, its edges blurring into the grey, indifferent sky. This was the perfect patient: terminal, isolated, and with nothing left to lose.

With her heart a cold, tight knot in her chest, Esme crossed the road and set the laptop bag down on the cracked concrete floor of the shelter. Inside, the plastic bench was covered in a film of grime and damp leaves, and the old timetable frame was empty, its contents long since rotted away. She took a moment, breathing in the scent of damp concrete and decay, preparing herself. Then, she knelt, unzipped the bag, and opened the laptop. The effect was immediate. The ambient, passive forgetting of the Blight was instantly overwhelmed by the focused, weaponised void emanating from the screen. The black circle pulsed once, and a wave of absolute cold swept through the shelter, killing the scent of damp and replacing it with the sterile, metallic smell of nothing. Through the screen’s eerie light, Esme could now clearly perceive the Blight. It was a shimmering, greasy film, like an oil slick on water, clinging to every surface of the bus shelter. It crawled with a slow, digestive energy, breaking down the very idea of the structure, unravelling the memories of everyone who had ever stood within it, patiently turning its story into meaningless static.

This was it. There was no turning back. Taking a shuddering breath, Esme placed her fingers on the trackpad. She did not think of destruction. She thought of surgery. She thought of the clean, precise lines on an anatomical chart. She focused all her will, not into a blast of power, but into a point of infinitesimal sharpness. She extended her intent through her fingertips and began to draw, not on the trackpad, but on the metaphysical canvas of the world in front of her. She traced the outline of the bus shelter, her mind’s eye defining a perimeter around the structure and the greasy film that clung to it. The black circle on the screen vibrated in harmony with her will, the deep hum rising in pitch. She was creating a quarantine, separating the patient from the disease. The effort was immense, a feat of sustained, intricate concentration that made her teeth ache and her vision swim. She felt the Blight resist, its passive decay coalescing into a stubborn, sticky inertia. It did not want to be moved.

With the quarantine established, she began the excision. She moved her fingers in a slow, deliberate pinching motion on the trackpad, and focused on a single, brutal command: *Cut*. The black circle on the screen flared, expanding for a fraction of a second to fill the entire display. A soundless concussion rocked the air in the shelter. The greasy, shimmering film of the Blight detached from the metal and plastic surfaces all at once, peeling away like sunburnt skin. It hung in the air for a horrifying moment, a ghost of the bus shelter made of pure decay, before it was drawn with incredible speed into the screen of the laptop. It wasn't an explosion; it was an implosion. A violent, silent act of consumption. The black circle snapped back to its original size, but Esme could have sworn it was a fraction darker, its edges sharper, its presence more absolute. The deep hum settled back into its usual frequency, but it now carried a faint, resonant undertone of satisfaction. The tool had fed. And it had worked.

The air in the shelter warmed by a few crucial degrees, losing its sterile, metallic tang. The oppressive feeling of forgetting was gone. Esme looked around, her senses raw and tingling. The bus shelter was not repaired. The rust was still there, the polycarbonate was still cracked, the brambles still clawed at its edges. But it felt… stable. Solid. Its edges were defined against the grey sky once more. It was no longer a place that was actively coming undone. It was simply a derelict bus stop, a mundane piece of urban decay, subject to the honest, physical ravages of time and weather, not the insidious corrosion of a metaphysical plague. She had not healed it. She had amputated the disease, leaving a clean, honest scar. She had returned it to the real world.

Slowly, shakily, Esme closed the laptop, cutting off the terrible hum. The silence that rushed in was a blessing. She sagged against the grimy wall, every muscle trembling with a mixture of relief and absolute terror. The experiment had been a success, more successful than she could have possibly imagined. She held in her hands the power to fight the Blight, to perform a hundred, a thousand, such amputations across the city. She could save the statues, the fading rings, the forgotten places. But the cost was terrifyingly clear. The tool was not a passive scalpel; it was a predator. Each time she used it to cut away the rot, she would be feeding the void, making it stronger, more defined, more hungry. She stood up, her legs unsteady, and zipped the dormant monster back into its bag. As she looked out from the now-mundane shelter at the empty road and the scrubland stretching towards a hazy horizon, she was faced with the most terrible choice of her life: let her city slowly fade into a story no one could remember, or fight back with a weapon that might one day turn and consume the restorer along with the rot.The bus ride back into the heart of Wolverhampton was a journey through a world that had suddenly snapped into terrifyingly sharp focus. Esme sat hunched in her seat, the canvas bag containing the laptop held tightly on her knees, an anchor of cold dread in the warm, vibrating vehicle. The city she was returning to was no longer just a patient slowly succumbing to a wasting sickness; it was now a battlefield, and she was its sole, horrifyingly-armed combatant. Every fading shop sign, every neglected public bench, every piece of half-forgotten civic art they passed was a potential casualty, a potential candidate for her terrible, silent surgery. The power she now possessed recast her relationship with her home. She was no longer just its secret fixer; she was its potential executioner, holding a weapon that saved the body by annihilating a piece of the soul. The choice she faced was no longer abstract. It had the weight and chill of the laptop on her lap, a constant, physical reminder of the dark pact she had stumbled into.

Back in the hushed sanctuary of her flat, the contrast between her two modes of magic had become an almost physical presence. On the kitchen table, the slow work of restoration continued its gentle, patient progress. Chloe’s ring, resting on its saucer, now held a steady, warm glow, a small hearth fire of rekindled memory. The teddy bear, propped against a stack of books, seemed to exude a faint but definite air of contentment. In the porcelain bowl on her coffee table, the miniature world of Sir Reginald had gained new detail; Esme was certain she could now see the individual titles on the spines of the books on his study shelves. This was the magic of accretion, of patient addition, of nurturing a dying ember back into a flame. It was good, and it was true, and looking at the scale of the problem outside her window, she knew with a sickening certainty that it was not enough. Her gaze inevitably drifted to the canvas bag she had dropped by the door, where the laptop now sat, silent and waiting. It was the magic of instantaneous, absolute subtraction. A brutal, efficient, and deeply corrupting power that promised results.

The following days were a torment of indecision. She continued her sessions with Chloe and Sharon, their quiet storytelling a balm that felt increasingly like a guilty indulgence. They were celebrating the saving of a single, precious tree while a forest fire raged over the horizon. Every time Esme stepped outside, she saw more evidence of the Blight’s creeping progress. A community notice board whose posters were all faded to illegibility, a local pub whose once-famous name everyone seemed to have trouble recalling, a children’s playground where the old, lovingly-painted murals of fairy-tale characters had become meaningless blurs of colour that no one looked at twice. The city was haemorrhaging its identity, and she was sitting in her flat coaxing a single note from a broken music box. The thought was unbearable, a constant, grinding pressure that wore down her resolve. The laptop called to her, not with a voice, but with the silent, compelling logic of its own terrible efficiency. The temptation to use the scalpel, to make a real, tangible difference, became a low, insistent hum in the back of her mind.

She finally broke. She couldn’t risk Chloe’s ring, which was so close to being whole, or the teddy bear, whose burgeoning personality felt too fragile to survive the laptop’s cold touch. But the music box was different. Its damage was not a slow fading, but a violent shattering. Its melody was a jigsaw puzzle with a thousand pieces, and she had only managed to find a single one. Perhaps, she reasoned, in a desperate act of self-justification, the problem was the trauma itself. The 'noise' of its unmaking was drowning out the 'signal' of its song. If she could just perform a more delicate surgery, if she could use the void to excise the memory of its own destruction, she might clear the way for the original melody to re-emerge. It was a flimsy, dangerous rationalization, the kind of logic that builds a path to damnation one reasonable-sounding step at a time, but it was all she had. With trembling hands, she placed the tarnished silver box in the centre of her kitchen floor and retrieved the laptop.

Opening it once more in her flat felt like a desecration. The familiar cold swept through the room, curdling the warm, story-filled air. The scent of cherry tobacco and beef casserole vanished, replaced by the sterile odour of ozone and absence. The black circle pulsed on the screen, seeming to greet the familiar space with a possessive stillness. Kneeling on the floor, Esme focused on the music box. This was infinitely more complex than excising a film from an external surface. She had to reach inside the object, into its very concept, and identify the specific, resonant frequency of its trauma, the lingering echo of the Mourner’s touch, and cut it out without damaging the delicate, fractured melody intertwined with it. She extended her will, her fingers hovering over the trackpad, picturing the damage not as a film, but as a spiderweb of black, cracked veins running through the silver. She had to be a neurosurgeon, not a butcher. She targeted a single, ugly fissure of remembered violence, drew a conceptual line around it, and whispered the command, “Cut.” The hum of the laptop sharpened to a piercing whine. The music box on the floor shuddered, and a thin wisp of what looked like black smoke rose from its lid and was instantly drawn into the screen. The black circle pulsed with satisfaction. Esme held her breath, her own senses screaming from the proximity to the active void. Then, she reached out and flicked the winding key.

The mechanism turned smoothly. And a melody began to play. It was perfect. Every note was pristine, mathematically precise, rendered with a flawless, digital clarity. It was the tune she had been searching for, a sweet, simple, poignant lullaby. And it was utterly, horrifyingly dead. The tune had been restored, but its soul had been amputated. All the warmth, all the emotional resonance of the memories attached to it—the little girl’s birthday, the old couple’s dance—was gone. It was a perfect recording, a soulless automaton performing a sequence of notes. She had not fixed it. She had lobotomized it, replacing the messy, complex beauty of its shattered memories with a cold, sterile, and empty perfection. A wave of nausea and self-loathing washed over her. She stared at the flawlessly playing but utterly dead object, and understood the true nature of the devil’s bargain she had struck. The void did not just destroy; it replaced. It consumed the rich, complicated tapestry of life, with all its beautiful flaws and painful memories, and left behind a clean, orderly, and perfectly empty facsimile. As the soulless tune tinkled on in the cold air of her kitchen, Esme felt a new sensation, a strange hollowness in her own mind. She tried to recall what she’d had for breakfast that morning, a simple, mundane fact. And she couldn't. There was just a smooth, clean, empty space where the memory should have been. The laptop hadn't just taken its payment from the music box. It had taken a small tip from the surgeon, too.The tinkling melody of the lobotomized music box filled the cold air of the kitchen, each perfect, soulless note a tiny hammer blow against Esme’s sanity. It was the sound of a beautiful corpse, meticulously embalmed and dressed in its finest clothes, with nothing of the person left inside. A wave of revulsion, so violent it was almost a physical spasm, shot through her. With a choked cry, she lunged forward and slammed the silver lid shut, cutting off the melody mid-phrase. The sudden silence was a profound relief, a clean wound after a nagging, septic pain. She stared at the box, her creation, her monstrous success, and felt a self-loathing so pure it left no room for any other emotion. She hadn’t fixed it; she had violated it, stripping it of its history, its pain, its joy, and leaving behind only an empty, functional shell.

Then, the second wave of horror hit her, colder and sharper than the first. The memory of her breakfast. It wasn't just fuzzy; it was a cavity, a neatly excised hole in the tapestry of her morning. She scrambled for other memories, her thoughts a frantic scrabbling in the dark. *What was the name of the author of the poetry collection on the table?* Blank. She could see the cover, the abstract design, but the name was a smooth, impenetrable wall. *What was the last thing Tariq said to her?* She could remember his face, the fear in his eyes, but the exact words, the grim warning he’d issued, were gone, replaced by a vague sense of dread. The laptop hadn’t just taken a tip from the surgeon. It had performed a parallel, microscopic amputation on her own mind, tidying away the inconvenient clutter of her recent past as payment for its services. The void didn't just consume; it edited.

With a surge of panicked energy, Esme turned on the laptop. She slammed the lid shut, the click of the latch a sound of final, desperate severance. The oppressive hum and the bone-deep cold vanished instantly, the air in the flat rushing back in to fill the vacuum, thick with the familiar scents of dust and old books and the faint, lingering aroma of beef casserole. She couldn't destroy the machine—she had no idea how, and the thought of what might happen if she tried was too terrifying to contemplate. But she could no longer live with it. She grabbed the heavy woollen blanket from the back of her sofa, a garishly coloured and slightly scratchy thing her nan had knitted over the course of a long, chatty winter years ago. It was an object saturated with love, patience, and flawed, human warmth. With a grim sense of purpose, she wrapped the laptop in it, swaddling the cold, perfect void in a cocoon of messy, real memory. She carried the muffled bundle to her wardrobe and shoved it into the back, burying it under a pile of old jumpers and forgotten coats. It was a flimsy prison, a child’s defence against a monster, but it was all she had. She had to put it out of sight, to make the choice to use it again as difficult as humanly possible.

She returned to the kitchen table, her body trembling, her mind feeling scoured. She felt like a heretic who had just renounced a dark and powerful god. Her gaze fell upon the other patients. The teddy bear, the waiting diary, and the simple gold ring on its saucer. She picked up the ring. Its gentle, steady warmth was a shocking contrast to the memory of the laptop’s cold. It pulsed faintly in her palm, and she felt not a perfect, sterile idea, but a complex, messy chord of emotion: a pang of remembered laughter, the sharp sting of a lover’s quarrel, the deep, quiet comfort of a shared silence. It was flawed, incomplete, and gloriously, stubbornly alive. In that moment, her path, which had forked into two terrifying possibilities, became a single, narrow, difficult road. Her choice was made, not with a burst of heroic conviction, but with the quiet, bone-deep certainty of a survivor. She would not become a surgeon of the void. She would remain a restorer of the beautifully, heartbreakingly broken.

When Chloe and Sharon arrived for their next session, they found a different Esme. The haunted, distracted air had been replaced by a quiet, formidable focus. The exhaustion was still there, etched deep into the lines around her eyes, but it was now the weariness of a labourer committed to a great work, not the despair of a soul lost in the dark. She guided their storytelling with a new precision, pushing past the easy memories into the difficult, contradictory heart of their family’s story. She asked about the failures, the disappointments, the griefs. They spoke of financial worries, of children who had moved away, of the slow, painful decline of illness at the end. They did not just remember a love story; they rebuilt a life, with all its cracks and imperfections, and the ring on the table absorbed it all, glowing brighter and stronger not in spite of the painful memories, but because of them.

At the end of their fourth week, the work was done. The ring on its saucer no longer just glowed; it seemed to hum with a life of its own, the light it cast a deep, rich gold that painted the small kitchen in tones of warmth and history. The air around it was thick with a tangible presence, a complex perfume of cherry tobacco, rose-scented hand cream, and something else, something intangible and lovely that could only be described as sixty years of shared existence. With a reverence that felt new and profound, Esme picked it up. It felt solid, whole, an anchor of memory in the turbulent sea of time. She walked around the table and, without a word, placed it into Sharon’s outstretched palm.

The effect was instantaneous and overwhelming. Sharon gasped, a sharp, ragged intake of breath, her eyes widening as they filled with tears. Her hand closed around the ring, clutching it to her chest. “Oh,” she whispered, her voice choked with an emotion that was beyond simple sadness or joy. “It’s him. It’s not just a memory. I can *feel* him.” Chloe, her own face wet with tears, reached out and placed her hand over her mother’s, their two hands sandwiching the small, powerful circlet of gold. She nodded, unable to speak, the full, vibrant, complicated story of the people she had never met flowing into her from the simple object. They sat there for a long time, mother and daughter, united in a perfect circle of restored memory, their quiet weeping the most beautiful sound Esme had ever heard.

Esme gave them their space, retreating to the far side of the room and leaning against the wall, a wave of profound, cleansing exhaustion washing over her. This was the answer. This was the victory. It was not a grand, city-saving miracle. It had not fixed the fading statue or the forgotten pub. It was a single, tiny point of light reclaimed from the encroaching dusk. But it was real. It was whole. And it was good. She had chosen her path, and this small, sacred moment was her reward. As she watched the mother and daughter share their recovered past, she knew with an unshakeable certainty that she would never again open the wardrobe door. The Blight was still out there, the war was far from over, but she had found her weapon. It wasn’t the quick, clean cut of the scalpel. It was the slow, patient, and infinitely more powerful work of the needle and thread, of stitching a world back together, one story at a time.The quiet that settled in the flat after Chloe and Sharon left was a different kind of silence. It was not the sterile, hungry void of the Mourner, nor the muffled quiet of Esme’s own sensory retreat. It was a gentle, resonant peace, the feeling of a room after a heartfelt and healing conversation has ended. The air was still thick with the warmth of the restored ring, a golden, complex scent of a life fully remembered. Esme sank into her worn armchair, a profound exhaustion settling into her bones, but it was a good, clean ache, the feeling of a muscle well-used, not a spirit broken. She had done more than fix something; she had made something whole again. The victory was small, a single point of light in a vast and encroaching darkness, but it was hers, and it was real. It was proof that her new path, this slow and difficult road of restoration, was the right one.

In the days that followed, she established a new, quiet routine, a monastic rhythm dictated by the needs of her remaining patients. The diary and Sir Reginald’s pearl were long-term projects, requiring a depth of focus she could only muster in short bursts. Her main efforts turned to the teddy bear. The simple act of telling it her own stories was having a limited effect; it was like trying to nourish a starving man on broth. The bear needed a richer, more specific diet of affection. One afternoon, a new idea, born of her evolving craft, led her to a large, cluttered charity shop on the Dudley Road. She didn’t buy anything. Instead, she found a quiet corner near the bins of children’s toys and worn baby clothes and simply sat, her eyes closed, listening with her slowly healing senses. The air was thick with the residue of a thousand small, powerful moments of love: the fierce, protective pride knitted into a tiny cardigan, the boisterous joy clinging to a scuffed plastic dinosaur, the deep, comforting security imbued in a threadbare blanket. She didn't take these feelings or drain them. She studied them, learned their texture, their flavour, their unique resonant frequencies, like a master perfumer learning to distinguish the notes in a complex scent. She returned to her flat and, sitting with the silent teddy bear, began to hum, not her own memories, but the pure, distilled essence of the love she had observed. It was slow, intricate work, but by the end of the week, the bear was no longer slumped. It sat upright on her table, its button eyes seeming to hold a glimmer of curiosity, a nascent personality coaxed from the void by a carefully curated diet of second-hand love.

This quiet, cloistered existence was shattered by the arrival of a single, starkly red envelope, shoved through her letterbox with unapologetic force. It was a final demand for two months of unpaid rent, complete with the requisite threats of legal action and eviction spelled out in aggressive, sans-serif font. The grim reality of the mundane world intruded on her metaphysical convalescence. Restoring souls and rekindling memories was profoundly important work, but it did not, she was forced to admit, pay the gas bill. The small amount of cash Chloe’s mother had pressed into her hand out of gratitude had long since been spent on tea and bread. The pressure that had been a low hum of anxiety now became a shrill, insistent alarm. She had to find a way to make this new, slow magic pay, a thought that felt like a profanity whispered in a library, but one that was essential for her survival.

The knock on her door, a few days later, was different. It was not the frantic drumming of the desperate, nor the apologetic tap of the anxious. It was a pair of precise, confident raps, the sound of someone who was certain they were in the right place and was prepared to wait. Wary, Esme peered through the spyhole. An elderly man stood in the gloomy hallway, his back ramrod straight. He was dressed in a dark, well-tailored suit that looked a decade out of fashion but impeccably maintained, and he held a slim leather briefcase in one gloved hand. He looked less like a client and more like a solicitor arriving to read a will. Taking a breath, she unbolted the locks and opened the door. He inclined his head slightly, his gaze sharp and intelligent. “Miss Blackwood? My name is Alistair Abernathy. I’m the chief archivist for the city.” His voice was dry and precise, like the rustle of old parchment. “I was given your name by a mutual acquaintance with an interest in… unique preservation challenges. He suggested you possess a sympathetic touch for particularly delicate historical artefacts.”

Mr. Abernathy stepped inside at her hesitant invitation, his eyes sweeping over the cluttered flat. He seemed not to see the mess, his gaze instead lingering for a moment on the teddy bear, then the glowing pearl, with a flicker of professional, rather than supernatural, interest. He placed his briefcase on the table and undid the clasps with a pair of neat clicks. He didn't produce a cursed idol or a haunted painting. He withdrew a small, oilskin-wrapped package. He carefully unwrapped it to reveal a small, worn leather wallet, the kind a soldier might carry. From it, he produced a thin bundle of letters, tied with a faded, fragile silk ribbon, and a single, tarnished brass cap badge bearing the insignia of the South Staffordshire Regiment. "These belonged to Private Daniel Hewitt," Mr. Abernathy explained, his voice taking on a hushed, reverent tone. "Killed at Passchendaele, 1917. His effects were returned to his mother here in Wolverhampton. The family donated them to the archive fifty years ago. We have hundreds of such collections. But this one… this one is a problem." He gestured for her to look closer. "The ink is stable. The paper is sound. But we are losing him, Miss Blackwood. The story is… evaporating. Junior archivists who could read his handwriting perfectly six months ago now find it illegible. The emotional weight of the letters is gone. It is as if we are watching a photograph fade, but with words."

Esme reached out, her fingers hovering over the fragile paper. She didn't need to touch them to feel it. The cold, entropic thinning. The Blight was here, in this small, sacred collection, feeding on a hero’s memory. But beneath the creeping decay, she could feel something else: the faint, stubborn residue of a life lived with passion and terror. The gritty reality of the trenches, the bone-deep weariness, and a fierce, desperate love for a girl named Eleanor whose name was scrawled on every other page. This was a narrative far more complex than a sixty-year marriage, interwoven with the grand, terrible tapestry of world history. She realised instantly that she couldn’t just prompt memories from a living relative. Daniel Hewitt’s world was gone. To save his story, she would have to rebuild it. She would have to become a historian, to research his regiment, to understand the geography of the Ypres Salient, to learn the context of his words so she could give them the weight they needed to fight back against the creeping nothingness.

"I can try," Esme said, her voice quiet but firm. The task was monumental, but it was a concrete problem, a solvable equation, and for the first time, it offered a way for her new skills to earn their keep. She named a price, a modest sum for what she knew would be weeks of painstaking work, but enough to placate her landlord and buy herself time. Mr. Abernathy agreed without hesitation, a profound relief smoothing the worried lines on his face. He seemed to sense he was purchasing something beyond mere conservation. As he was leaving, he paused in the open doorway, turning back to her. "This… fading," he said, his voice dropping, the professional archivist replaced for a moment by a worried citizen. "It's not just our Private Hewitt, is it, Miss Blackwood? I've noticed it elsewhere. The names on the cenotaph seem harder to focus on this year. The inscription on the Boulton and Watt statue… it’s like trying to read through water. It's as though the city is developing a cataract on its own memory." He gave her a long, knowing look, an unspoken acknowledgement that they were both observing the same creeping sickness, even if only one of them understood the cause.

After he had gone, Esme was left alone in the quiet of her flat with the soldier’s wallet. The weight of it in her hands was immense. It was not just a job; it was a commission, a sacred trust. This was the bridge between the small, private griefs she had been healing and the vast, public decay she had witnessed. It was a challenge that would demand every ounce of her skill, both as a restorer and as a researcher. She looked from the fading letters to the small, stable world of Sir Reginald, to the teddy bear who now seemed to be patiently waiting for its next story. Her path was becoming clearer, wider. It was not just about fixing what was broken, but about championing what was being forgotten. With a deep breath that felt like the beginning of a long and difficult journey, she untied the fragile ribbon, carefully unfolded the first brittle letter, and began the slow, essential work of learning a dead man's life so that she could teach it back to itself.The work on Private Hewitt began not with a spell, but with a confession of ignorance. For the first two days, Esme did nothing but sit with the thin bundle of letters, reading them over and over until the delicate, spidery script became familiar to her eye. The Blight had already taken a heavy toll. The words were there, but they were becoming hollowed out, their emotional resonance leached away, leaving behind the dry, factual husk of a narrative. Phrases that should have conveyed a universe of longing—"My dearest Eleanor, I think of you always"—felt like empty stenography. A harrowing description of a night in a waterlogged trench read with the flat, dispassionate tone of a surveyor’s report. The memory was losing its lifeblood, and Esme knew that simply pouring her own energy into it would be like trying to revive a body with a transfusion of the wrong blood type. She needed Daniel Hewitt’s blood. She needed his world.

With the first installment of Mr. Abernathy’s fee—a sum that felt both shockingly large and pitifully inadequate—Esme paid her most urgent bills and then turned the rest into resources. She became a fixture at the City Archives, a pale, intense ghost haunting the quiet microfilm readers and dusty municipal records. She wasn't a fixer anymore, skittering through the city’s occult underground. She was a researcher, armed with a library card and a fierce, methodical patience. She cross-referenced Hewitt’s regiment, the 1st/6th South Staffordshire, with official war diaries, her fingers tracing the movements of his battalion across trench maps of the Ypres Salient that were themselves fragile artefacts. The names on the maps—Hooge, Sanctuary Wood, Polygon Wood—were no longer abstract historical footnotes; they became a litany, a geography of suffering she committed to memory. She spent an entire afternoon scrolling through grainy images of young men in ill-fitting uniforms, their faces a mixture of bravado and bewildered innocence, until she found a group photograph of Hewitt’s platoon, taken in a field in Kent before they shipped out. She found him in the back row, a young man with serious eyes and a slightly crooked smile, and the connection became suddenly, painfully real. He was no longer a name on a page; he was a face, a presence.

Back in her flat, the atmosphere shifted. The space, once a quiet infirmary, began to resemble a university professor’s cluttered office on the eve of a dissertation defence. Photocopies of maps were taped to her kitchen cabinets. Stacks of books on the Great War formed precarious new towers on her floor. Her work on the teddy bear and the pearl was put on hold. All her focus, all her slowly recovering energy, was channelled into this single, monumental task. The ritual, when it began, was a new kind of magic entirely. She would lay a single letter on her table, surrounded by the corresponding research: a map of the sector he was writing from, a list of slang terms used by the soldiers, a grainy photograph of the type of dugout he would have sheltered in. Then, she would begin to read aloud.

She did not just read the words; she reconstructed the world around them. When Daniel wrote of “the noise,” she would murmur the technical specifications of a German 5.9-inch howitzer, the "whizz-bang" of the 77mm field gun, the relentless chatter of a Maxim gun, building a symphony of terror around his simple, understated phrase. When he mentioned a friend, “poor Jacko,” who “got a Blighty one,” she would consult her notes and find the casualty list for that week, speaking the full name—Private John Allsop—into the room, honouring his memory as a fact, not just a nickname. She was not just reading the letter; she was re-contextualizing it, anchoring Daniel’s personal testimony to the vast, cold, and undeniable bedrock of historical fact. With each connection she forged, each piece of data she wove into the narrative, she felt a subtle shift. The ink on the page seemed to darken, the words regaining a fraction of their original weight. The Blight was a force of disconnection, of unravelling. Her magic was now the act of weaving things back together, of insisting, with overwhelming evidence, that this story mattered, that it was tied to a thousand other stories, a million other facts, and could not be so easily dismissed into static.

The emotional cost was immense. She was not just studying a war; she was immersing herself in the consciousness of a man trapped within it, and her raw, healing senses had no defence against the flood of second-hand trauma. After reading a letter that described, in clipped, censored prose, the aftermath of a gas attack, she spent an hour shivering on her sofa, her lungs aching with a phantom burning, the air in her flat tasting of metallic chemicals and mud. The sheer, grinding misery of the trenches, the constant fear, the boredom, the homesickness—it all seeped into her. In a moment of profound weakness, her gaze strayed to the wardrobe where the laptop lay dormant. The thought came, unbidden and seductive: a single, clean cut. Excise the trauma. Leave the love story. It would be so easy. It would be a mercy. But she remembered the soulless, tinkling perfection of the music box, and the thought died in a wave of self-disgust. The horror was part of the story. The pain was what gave the moments of tenderness and hope their desperate, brilliant light. To remove it would be another violation, another lie.

The breakthrough came from a detail so small she had almost missed it. In a letter from early 1917, written during a brief respite behind the lines, Daniel described receiving a parcel from home. "Eleanor, my love," he wrote, "the cake was a marvel, but the tin of Harrison's Specials was the true treasure. We sat in the barn and smoked them and for an hour it almost felt like being home, sitting outside the Bird in Hand on a summer's evening." Harrison's Specials, a brand of cigarettes. The Bird in Hand, a pub. These were tangible things, real-world connections. A quick search online confirmed it: Harrison's was a small, Wolverhampton-based tobacco company, long since defunct. But the Bird in Hand, remarkably, was still there, a red-brick Victorian pub on the edge of the city centre, less than a mile from her flat. That evening, Esme put on her coat and walked. She didn't go inside. She just stood across the street under a flickering streetlight, watching the warm, golden light spill from its windows, listening to the murmur of voices and the clink of glasses. It was a place of simple, mundane peace, a place Daniel Hewitt had held in his mind as a symbol of everything he was fighting to get back to. She stayed for an hour, absorbing the resonance of the place, letting the feeling of it soak into her. It was a direct, unbroken line from her world to his.

When she returned to her flat and read the letter again, holding the memory of the pub bright and clear in her mind, something tore open. The air in the room grew thick with the scent of damp wool, stale cigarette smoke, and rich, dark soil. For a fleeting, heart-stopping moment, she felt a distinct presence at her shoulder, not a ghost, but a solid, living memory—the feeling of a young man with serious eyes and a deep, abiding love for a girl and a desperate yearning for a simple summer's evening at home. The words on the page blazed with their original, passionate intensity. "My dearest Eleanor," they now screamed with a silent, desperate force, "I think of you always." Esme let out a shuddering breath, her own eyes wet with tears that were not entirely her own. She had found him. She had pulled his story back from the brink. The Blight was still there, a faint, cold static at the edges, but it was now in retreat, driven back by the overwhelming, undeniable power of a story fully and truthfully told.The completion of the Hewitt project was not marked by a final, dramatic spell, but by the quiet click of a leather strap being fastened. The letters, no longer a fragile bundle of dying words, now felt dense and substantial in Esme’s hands, humming with a restored and hard-won vitality. The ink was a deep, defiant black against the cream-coloured paper, and the air around the wallet was rich with the layered scents of history: the faint, metallic tang of fear, the sweet ache of longing, and the earthy, stubborn aroma of West Midlands soil. She had not just saved a story; she had rebuilt its foundations and re-thatched its roof, making it a home for a memory once more.

When she delivered the wallet to Mr. Abernathy in the hushed, cavernous reading room of the City Archives, his reaction was one of profound, almost religious awe. He didn’t inspect her work like a client reviewing a transaction. He received the wallet with both hands, his archivist’s gloves seeming less a tool of preservation and more a gesture of reverence. He untied the ribbon and unfolded the top letter, his eyes scanning the first few lines. A slow, incredulous smile spread across his face, a sunrise of pure, academic joy. “Incredible,” he breathed, his voice a low whisper that barely disturbed the sacred silence of the room. He looked up at Esme, his sharp eyes holding a new and profound respect. “Miss Blackwood, you are not a mere conservator. You are… a miracle worker.” He gestured for her to follow him to his office, a cramped space overflowing with books and smelling of old paper and leather polish. From a drawer in his heavy oak desk, he produced not just the remainder of her fee, but a chequebook. “The City Heritage Trust has a discretionary fund for… acquisitions and special projects,” he said, the careful, bureaucratic phrasing failing to hide his excitement. “I have been authorised to retain your services. Consider yourself our first, and only, Consultant in Narrative Integrity.”

The title was absurd, the situation surreal, but the cheque he wrote was undeniably real. It was more money than Esme had ever seen in one place, enough to banish the specter of eviction for a year or more. It was stability. It was security. It was the legitimate, tangible reward for her strange and difficult art. For the first time in a very long time, Esme felt the loosening of a knot of anxiety she hadn’t even realised she’d been carrying, a constant, low-grade fear of the mundane world’s unforgiving mathematics. She walked home in a daze, the city seeming brighter, its noises less of an assault and more of a complex, vibrant symphony. She treated herself to a coffee from a small independent cafe, sitting by the window and watching the world go by, feeling for a moment like a normal person, a professional with a salary and a purpose.

Her new role, however, came with a new and daunting perspective. As the official, if secret, custodian of the city’s memory, she now saw the creeping threat of the Blight everywhere. Her attunement to the magic of story was now so refined that she could feel its absence as keenly as a missing tooth. The fading pub signs and forgotten statues were just the most obvious symptoms. She began to notice it in the conversations she overheard on the bus, in the way people struggled to recall the name of a local politician who had been in the papers only last year, or a community festival that had been a beloved annual tradition until it simply… wasn’t. The Blight was accelerating, moving on from the deep past to consume the recent past, chewing away at the cultural memory that held the living city together. The problem was not just a collection of isolated cases; it was a systemic failure, an epidemic of forgetting.

Her fears were confirmed when Abernathy summoned her a week later. This time, he didn’t have a single, precious wallet. He led her into a small, climate-controlled storeroom in the archive’s basement. On a long metal table sat a series of grey, acid-free archival boxes. He lifted the lid on the first one. Inside, nestled on a bed of tissue paper, were dozens of small artefacts. A suffragette’s rosette, its vibrant purple and green faded to a dusty mauve, its resonant defiance almost entirely gone. A factory worker’s union membership card from the 1926 General Strike, its story of solidarity and struggle thinned to a set of barely legible names and dates. A bundle of faded dance cards from the 1950s, their memories of nervous excitement and burgeoning romance all but erased. And box after box after box, each one containing a dozen more dying stories. “This is just what we’ve identified in the last week,” Abernathy said, his voice grim. “We’re facing an unprecedented decay event across the entire collection. It’s as though our history has contracted a wasting disease. We need you to do what you did for Private Hewitt… for all of them.”

Esme stared at the mountain of work, and the coffee she had enjoyed a week ago turned to acid in her stomach. The Hewitt project had taken her three weeks of total, all-consuming immersion. To give each of these artefacts the same focused, dedicated care would take her a lifetime. A dozen lifetimes. She was a single artisan, a master craftswoman, faced with the task of personally re-weaving every thread in a tapestry the size of a city as it unravelled in real time. The sheer, crushing impossibility of the task descended on her like a physical weight, squeezing the air from her lungs. She could save one. She could save ten. But she could not save them all. Not like this. Not with the slow magic.

That night, sleep offered no escape. She dreamt of a vast library where the words were lifting off the pages like smoke, the stories dissolving into a meaningless, whispering fog around her as she tried desperately to read them all at once. She woke up in the pre-dawn dark, her heart pounding, the dream’s sense of overwhelming futility clinging to her like a shroud. She sat up in bed, staring into the gloom of her bedroom. Her gaze was drawn, as if by a magnetic force, to the wardrobe. To the closed door behind which the laptop lay, wrapped in her nan’s warm, loving, and entirely inadequate blanket. The thought rose in her mind, insidious and horribly logical. *Triage*. It was a cold, clinical word, the language of battlefield medics and overwhelmed emergency rooms. You can’t save everyone. So you save who you can, by any means necessary. The slow magic was for the special cases, the ones she could afford to lavish with time and care. But for the rest? The hundreds of fading dance cards, the dozens of union cards? A quick, clean cut. Excise the Blight. Leave a clean, if soulless, record. It would be a compromise. A terrible, soul-corroding compromise. But it would be *something*. It would be a holding action against the tide. It would be a way to *win*. Slowly, as if moving through deep water, she swung her legs out of bed. The floorboards were cold beneath her bare feet. She stood up and took a step, and then another, drawn across the room by the terrible, pragmatic promise of a power that could actually meet the scale of the disaster. She stopped in front of the wardrobe, her reflection a pale, haunted ghost in the polished wood. She reached out, her fingers trembling, and closed them around the cold brass handle of the door.Her fingers, trembling slightly, closed around the cold brass handle. The click of the wardrobe’s latch opening was a small, sharp sound in the quiet room, but it felt as final and irrevocable as the locking of a cell door. The faint, familiar scent of lavender and old wool drifted out, a ghost of her nan’s comforting presence, but it was immediately chased away by a deeper, more profound cold emanating from within. The laptop was exactly where she had left it, a dark shape swaddled in the bright, garish colours of the knitted blanket. It was a profane parody of a mother holding a child. For a moment she hesitated, her hand hovering over the warm, familiar texture of the wool. This felt like the real transgression. Not just using the void, but bringing it into contact with something so saturated with love, something so purely good. With a grimace, she pushed the thought aside, reached in, and lifted the bundle. The laptop’s conceptual weight and unnatural chill were barely muted by the thick layers of wool. She carried it back to the kitchen table, her own personal altar of restoration, and unwrapped it as if handling unexploded ordnance.

She didn't start with the archives. She couldn’t. She needed one more test, a final confirmation of the awful methodology she was about to adopt. Her first subject was a small, almost insignificant item Mr. Abernathy had given her as a sample of the decay. It was a single dance card from a Trades Hall ball in 1952, its tiny pencil still attached by a frayed silk cord. The Blight was feasting on it; the handwritten names of the dance partners were fading into illegible grey smudges, and the card's entire aura of nervous excitement and youthful hope had thinned to a barely-there whisper. It was the perfect victim: anonymous, plentiful, and almost entirely lost already. Placing it on the bare floor, she knelt and opened the laptop. The room plunged into its familiar cold, and the black circle bloomed on the screen, a silent, hungry eye. This time, there was no hesitation, no desperate hope for a miracle. This was a procedure. She was a technician.

Extending her will, she ignored the object’s history, its soul. She focused solely on the physical data: the paper, the ink, the graphite. She envisioned them not as a story, but as a set of coordinates, a collection of matter to be stabilised. She used the trackpad to draw a tight, merciless boundary around the card, her command a cold, simple thought: *Isolate the data. Excise the decay.* The hum of the machine sharpened into a high, clinical whine. The familiar greasy film of the Blight peeled away from the card and was consumed in a silent, violent implosion into the screen. The black circle pulsed, and the whine subsided. As the void fed, Esme braced herself for the backlash. The memory of the taste of her morning tea vanished. The name of the street the charity shop was on became a smooth, blank space in her mind. It was a clean, precise transaction. A toll had been paid. She reached down and picked up the dance card. The names were now perfectly crisp, the printed crest of the Trades Hall sharp and defined. It was a flawless piece of historical data, a perfect record. And it was as inert and meaningless as a random page from a phone book. She felt a flicker of the old revulsion, but it was swiftly suppressed by a new, colder feeling: the grim satisfaction of a difficult job completed successfully. The card was saved. By her new, terrible metric, the operation was a triumph.

When she presented the stabilised dance card to Alistair Abernathy the next day, his reaction solidified her new path. He adjusted his spectacles, holding the small piece of card under the bright lamp on his desk, his expression a mixture of awe and disbelief. He compared it to a high-resolution digital photograph taken a month earlier, which showed the names as faint, ghostly smudges. "It's not just stopped, it's… it's been reversed," he murmured, utterly captivated. "The legibility is perfect. How on earth did you do it, Miss Blackwood? Some sort of chemical treatment?" Esme offered a vague, non-committal answer about resonating frequencies and stabilising molecular structures, a string of pseudo-scientific jargon that he accepted without question, too delighted by the result to scrutinize the method. He couldn't feel the soul-deep emptiness of the object, the utter silence where a story used to sing. He saw only the data, and the data was perfect. "This is extraordinary," he declared, his eyes gleaming. "You have full access. The storeroom is yours. Whatever you need. Just… save them." His validation was a key turning a lock in her soul. He wasn't just her client; he was her enabler, the man who saw her monstrous work as a miracle and begged her for more.

Her life fractured. By day, she became a phantom in the climate-controlled basement of the archives. She set up a station in the storeroom, a small desk with the laptop and a rotating queue of acid-free boxes. The work became a grim, efficient assembly line of salvation and damnation. She would take an object—a suffragette’s rosette, a packet of wartime ration coupons, a theatre ticket from the opening night of the Grand Theatre in 1894—place it in her designated 'operating theatre' on the floor, and perform the cold, silent surgery. The laptop’s hum was a constant presence, the chill a familiar working condition. With each successful procedure, a small, useless piece of her own memory was shaved away, a tiny payment she came to accept as a professional hazard. She started carrying a notebook, jotting down mundane details—what she needed to buy from the shop, the names of people she’d spoken to—to compensate for the growing fog in her own mind. By night, she would return to her flat, the scent of the archives and the faint, cold tang of the void clinging to her clothes. She would scrub her hands until they were raw, as if to wash away the day's work, and then sit at her kitchen table. Here, in the warm glow of her small lamp, she would perform the other magic, the slow magic. She would speak softly to the teddy bear, or concentrate on the glowing pearl, or carefully trace the words in Private Hewitt’s letters, reaffirming their weight and meaning. Her life was now a perfect, monstrous duality. She was a tender of the flame and a purveyor of the dark, a restorer of souls and a dealer in beautiful, empty corpses.The weeks bled into a month, and Esme’s life settled into a rhythm as stark and unforgiving as a line of binary code. Her days were spent in the climate-controlled sterility of the archives basement, a grey world of metal shelving and the quiet, constant hum of dehumidifiers. The storeroom became her office, her operating theatre. She developed a cold, detached efficiency, processing the dying artefacts with the dispassionate skill of a bomb disposal expert. A box of Crimean War medals, their stories of valour and terror fading like breath on a mirror, would be placed on the floor. The laptop would be opened, the chill would descend, and Esme would perform the silent, terrible surgery. The medals would emerge pristine, their engravings sharp, their physical forms secured for posterity. And Esme would lose the memory of the taste of coffee, or the plot of the book she’d been reading the night before. She catalogued the loss as a cost of doing business, a tithe paid to a dark god for services rendered. Her notebook became her external hard drive, filled with mundane reminders: "Buy milk." "Landlord's name is Mr. Davies." "Tariq’s warning—something about burning." The last entry was a ghost, a note about a memory she no longer possessed, and it didn't frighten her as much as it should have.

Her nights were a desperate attempt to maintain the balance, to be the restorer once more. She would return to her flat, the cold of the void clinging to her clothes and skin, and try to re-engage with the slow magic. But the bleed-through was undeniable. Her methodology had been corrupted. When she sat with the teddy bear, she found herself cataloguing the different types of love she had observed in the charity shop, trying to apply them in a logical, structured sequence, as if affection were a chemical formula. Her focus on Sir Reginald’s pearl was no longer a gentle meditation; it was a task, a project with a desired outcome, and her impatience when the world within the pearl failed to clarify quickly enough was a new and ugly feeling. She was trying to manage her soul's work with the clinical detachment of her day job, and the two warring methodologies created a constant, grinding friction in her spirit, leaving her more exhausted than ever. She was saving the city’s history by day and failing to properly nurture her own small collection of broken souls by night.

One Tuesday evening, as she was mechanically stirring a pot of soup she barely had the energy to eat, a hesitant knock echoed from her door. It was the quiet, apologetic sound she now associated with clients, but it had been weeks since she had taken one on. Wearily, she went to the door and peered through the spyhole. Her heart gave a complicated, painful lurch. It was Arthur Pumble. He was holding a small, paper-wrapped bouquet of garage forecourt carnations, his expression a mixture of hope and nervous deference. He was a ghost from another lifetime, a time of simpler problems and clearer moral lines, and his presence on her doorstep felt like a judgment. She opened the door, managing a weak, tired smile. "Mr. Pumble," she said, her voice flatter than she intended. "What can I do for you?"

He shuffled inside, his eyes darting around the flat, which was now far tidier, the creative chaos replaced by a kind of sterile orderliness. "I do hope I'm not disturbing you, Miss Blackwood," he began, offering her the flowers with a trembling hand. "It's just… it's been some time. I was wondering about Sir Reginald. How is his… recuperation?" He looked towards the coffee table where the porcelain bowl sat, a hopeful, paternal eagerness in his eyes. Esme took the flowers, the simple gesture of kindness a sharp pang in her chest. She led him to the bowl. "Progress is stable," she said, the clinical, detached language of her new profession spilling out before she could stop it. "The core data matrix is intact, and the sensory diorama is resolving at a steady, if slow, pace. I've managed to restore approximately eighty percent of the primary environmental details."

Mr. Pumble stared at her, his kindly face clouded with confusion. "Data matrix?" he repeated, the words foreign and cold. "I… I don't understand. Is he… is he happy?" The question, so simple, so pure in its emotional honesty, struck Esme with the force of a physical blow. Happy. She hadn't considered happiness. She had been focused on resolution, on data integrity, on the successful completion of the project. She hadn't once tried to feel what the tiny, captured consciousness in the pearl was feeling. She had been treating a soul like a corrupted file. "I… I don't know," she admitted, the words tasting like ash. "Let's see." The need to give him a better answer, to prove to him—and to herself—that she was still the person he had first come to for help, was overwhelming. She sat down, gesturing for him to do the same, and placed her hands around the bowl, closing her eyes. She needed to reach for a pure, uncomplicated source of warmth, of gentle, nurturing magic, to coax a feeling of happiness from the pearl. The strongest, purest source she had ever known was her nan. She reached into her memory, searching for the feeling of her nan’s hand holding hers, the scent of lavender and soap, the sound of her humming a specific, nonsensical rhyme about a crooked man walking a crooked mile. It was her foundational memory, the bedrock of her gentle magic.

And it was gone.

The space in her mind where that memory should have been was a smooth, clean, perfectly empty void. There was no image, no scent, no sound. She could remember the *fact* of her nan, the *fact* of the song, but the feeling, the sensory reality, the very magic of the memory itself had been neatly and surgically excised. The toll for the Crimean medals. The payment for the suffragette’s rosette. It hadn't just been the taste of coffee or the name of a street. The void had been taking her, piece by precious piece, starting with the trivial and working its way, silently and patiently, to the core of her identity. She pulled her hands away from the bowl as if it were burning, a strangled gasp escaping her lips. Her notebook was on the table. She could write "Remember Nan's song," but it would be meaningless. You can't write down the feeling of a hand in yours. You can't archive the scent of love. She had become a perfect, soulless record of herself.

Mr. Pumble looked at her, his face etched with alarm. "Miss Blackwood? Are you alright? You've gone as white as a sheet." Esme stared at him, but she didn’t see him. She saw a future of perfect, legible artefacts in a city with no soul, preserved by a woman with no past. She had been fighting a plague of forgetting by infecting herself with a plague of emptiness. And she was winning.
