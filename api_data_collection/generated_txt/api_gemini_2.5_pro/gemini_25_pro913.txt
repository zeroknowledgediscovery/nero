The cold was a god. Here on the water, in the pre-dawn ink of the River Ness, Sergeant Gash knew this to be true. It was a merciless god, one that seeped into the marrow, that crystallised the breath in a man’s lungs, that demanded tribute in the form of burning muscles and a raw, screaming focus. He gave his tribute gladly. The single scull, a sliver of carbon fibre named ‘The Morrigan’, sliced through the black, glassy water. Each stroke was a prayer, a rhythm beaten out against the encroaching chaos of the world. Dip, pull, release, feather. The city of Inverness was still a sleeping beast on the banks, its lights soft and blurred, its stone buildings hunched against the Highland chill. Gash’s world was this narrow boat, the twin spoons of his oars, and the metronomic slide of the seat beneath him. It was a world of pure mechanics, of leverage and power, and it was the only place his mind ever truly fell silent.

He was a big man, Gash. Not fat, but dense with the kind of muscle built over a lifetime of labour, first in the fishing boats of the Black Isle, now here, on the river, and in the grim business of policing men. His shoulders were a solid yoke of power, his hands calloused and broad, capable of crushing force or, as now, the delicate feathering of an oar blade so it skimmed the surface without a whisper. The river was his confessor. He’d rowed after every bad call, every body he’d had to see zipped into a bag, every lie he’d had to listen to from a cornered scumbag. He rowed out the anger, the frustration, the clinging grime of his job, and left it in his wake, a turbulent memory on the placid face of the water. This morning, the water was unusually still. A mirror reflecting a sky that had not yet decided on a colour. The silence was profound, broken only by the rhythmic clunk and slide of his oars in the outriggers.

Then, a new sound. An alien vibration. It buzzed against the hull, a frantic, technological insect trapped in the ancient quiet. His phone. He grunted, shipping the oars with a practiced economy of motion, the boat gliding under its own momentum. He pulled the device from a waterproof pouch clipped to the foot stretcher. The screen’s glare was an assault. The name flashing was one he never wanted to see before his shift had even officially begun: Constable Fraser. Young, keen, and a harbinger of things Gash did not want to know about. He answered, the phone cold against his ear.

“Gash.”

“Sarge. Sorry to–”

“Just get to it, lad.” The steam of his own breath clouded the phone’s screen.

“It’s another one. No, not like the others. This one… this one’s different. Weirder. Found by a dog walker half an hour ago. An old boathouse, down past the marina, on the Firth side.”

Gash felt the familiar, leaden drop in his gut. The peace of the river shattered. The cold was no longer a god; it was just the damp, miserable air of a Tuesday morning in October. “How weird, Fraser?”

There was a pause on the other end, the sound of a shaky intake of breath. “Sarge… there’s a painting.”

Gash’s knuckles whitened on the phone. He said nothing. He didn’t need to. He knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than the river ever could, that the quiet part of his day was over. The quiet part of his life, perhaps. He disconnected the call without another word, stowed the phone, and with a powerful, angry pull of the oars, turned The Morrigan back towards the rowing club. The rhythm was gone. Now, it was just a race.

The boathouse sagged on its foundations, a rotten tooth in the gumline of the coast. The paint had long since peeled away, leaving the wood beneath a leprous grey, pocked with green mould. Salt and decay were heavy in the air, a smell Gash associated with forgotten things. The uniformed officers had taped it off, their flashing blue lights seeming garish and hysterical in the slowly strengthening dawn. Fraser was waiting for him by the tape, his face pale, his ginger hair looking almost white in the stark light. He was clutching a Styrofoam cup of coffee that trembled in his hand.

“Sarge,” he said, his voice hushed, reverent in the face of the horror within. “Forensics are on their way. Thought you’d want to see it… untouched.”

“Good lad,” Gash muttered, ducking under the tape. The door of the boathouse hung open on one hinge, a gaping mouth. Inside, the smell was a complex, nauseating cocktail. The expected brine and rot, but underneath it, something else. The sharp, clean scent of turpentine and linseed oil, and beneath that, the coppery, sweet tang of fresh blood. The floorboards groaned under Gash’s weight. The place was a wreck, filled with the detritus of a long-dead fisherman – brittle nets, a rusted engine block, shattered lobster pots. But in the centre of the room, someone had cleared a space. And in that space, they had created a tableau.

He was a boy. No more than seventeen. He lay on a canvas sailcloth that had been spread carefully on the floor. He was dressed in a clean white shirt and dark trousers. His dark, curly hair was damp, but neatly combed. His eyes were closed, his face serene, peaceful. He could have been sleeping, a beautiful, porcelain doll of a boy. Gash had seen a hundred bodies, mangled in car crashes, bloated in canals, savaged in pub brawls. He had never seen one laid out with such… care. Such artistry. It was obscene.

And then he saw the painting. It stood on a large, professional-looking easel, positioned just behind the boy’s head, as if it were a headboard for his deathbed. The canvas was huge, and the portrait upon it was breathtaking. It was the boy. But not the pale, lifeless boy on the floor. It was the boy in full, explosive life. The artist had captured him in a moment of laughter, head thrown back, eyes crinkling at the corners, a flush of sun on his cheeks. The detail was hyper-realistic, from the faint scar above his eyebrow to the tiny, almost invisible fraying on the collar of his denim jacket. The paint was still wet in places, glistening under the weak light filtering through a grimy window. The artist had used a vibrant, almost violent palette – rich ochres, deep vermilions, a blue in the eyes so electric it seemed to hum. This wasn't a photograph. It was more real than that. It was an act of possession. The artist hadn't just painted the boy; they had consumed him, digested him, and spat his soul out onto the canvas.

“Jesus, Mary and Joseph,” Fraser whispered from the doorway, making the sign of the cross. “It’s him. Liam Robertson. Went missing two days ago from his folks’ place in Crown. Who does this? Who paints them?”

Gash didn't answer. He was moving slowly, his eyes scanning every detail, his mind a cold, whirring engine of logic. The boy was dead, yes. But that wasn't the focal point. The body was just a prop. The painting was the statement. He knelt beside the body, careful not to disturb the sailcloth. He looked at the boy’s hands. Or, where his hands should have been. The cuffs of the crisp white shirt were stained a deep, dark red. They were tucked neatly, almost primly, at the boy’s sides. But they were empty. Both hands, from the wrist down, were gone. The cuts were clean, surgical. Not the work of a hacksaw or a cleaver. Something fine. Precise.

“The hands are gone, Fraser,” Gash said, his voice flat.

“Gone? What do you mean, gone? Where?”

“That’s the question, isn’t it?” Gash stood up and walked over to the easel. He stared at the painting, at the boy’s laughing face. The artist was a genius. A monster, but a genius. There was no rage in these brushstrokes. No frenzy. There was only an unnerving, absolute control. And something else. Staring into the painted eyes, Gash could almost feel it. A desperate, suffocating emotion that he couldn't quite name. It wasn't hate. It was something hotter, more possessive. He looked from the vibrant, living face on the canvas to the pale, dead one on the floor. One was a memory, one was a vessel. And the artist had decided which was which. Through the salt-caked window of the boathouse, he could see the grey, churning water of the Firth. The same element he had sought peace in just an hour ago. Now it felt like an accomplice, its vast, cold indifference a part of the crime itself. He had a feeling this killer knew the water as well as he did. This was a beginning. He could feel the shape of the coming obsession, a dark twin to his own rhythmic discipline. He had to find this artist. He had to understand the terrible, twisted love that fuelled such beautiful, awful things.He looked back at the painting. The vibrant, laughing boy on the canvas had hands. They were strong, relaxed hands, one resting on his knee, the other lost in the shadow of his jacket. The artist had painted them from memory, or perhaps from a photograph. But he had chosen to remove the real ones. A trophy? A signature? No, Gash thought, it felt more fundamental than that. An artist’s hands are their tools, the conduit for their vision. Liam Robertson wasn't an artist, as far as Gash knew. What had his hands done? Or was it what they could no longer do that mattered? Touch, hold, create, destroy. The killer had taken the boy’s agency, leaving him a passive object, a beautiful, broken thing to be looked at, his living essence transferred to the canvas.

The crunch of gravel outside announced the arrival of the Scene of Crime Officers. A moment later, Dr. Aris Thorne ducked under the doorframe, his lean figure looking almost comically out of place in the rustic squalor. Thorne was the chief pathologist, a man whose neat, silver-grey hair and impeccably tailored suits seemed immune to the grim reality of his profession. He moved with a quiet, academic grace, his eyes, behind rimless glasses, taking in the scene with an unnerving lack of emotion. He was a collector of facts, a reader of the body’s final, silent story.

“Sergeant,” Thorne acknowledged Gash with a slight nod, his gaze already fixed on the tableau. He set his large metal case down with a soft click and began to pull on a pair of latex gloves. “Fraser’s summary was… understated.” He walked a slow, deliberate circle around the body and the easel, his eyes missing nothing. “Tableau-vivant in reverse. Theatrics on a grand scale.” He crouched, his expensive trousers inches from the blood-soaked floorboards, and examined the boy’s peaceful face. “No sign of struggle. No obvious trauma to the head or torso. Pupils are fixed and dilated. Lividity is established on the posterior aspect, consistent with him being laid here post-mortem. The serenity is… pharmacological, I suspect.”

Thorne then moved his attention to the boy’s wrists. He peered at the clean, dark lines of the amputation, his expression one of pure, professional interest. “Exquisite work. Not a bone fragment out of place. This wasn’t a butcher. This was a craftsman. A very sharp, very fine-bladed saw, I should think. Possibly a surgical instrument. Done post-mortem, but not long after. Minimal blood loss at the site, the majority of it is seepage. He was already dead when his hands were taken.” Thorne stood up and turned his analytical gaze to the painting. He looked at it for a long time, longer than he had looked at the body. “And the artist is exceptionally gifted. This is not the work of a weekend hobbyist. This is a trained, confident hand.”

Gash pulled Fraser, who had been hovering by the door like a nervous ghost, outside into the sharp, salty air. The sun was higher now, a weak, watercolour wash of yellow and grey over the Moray Firth. “Right, listen to me,” Gash said, his voice low and urgent. “This killer, he didn’t just know Liam Robertson. He was obsessed with him. This painting,” he gestured back towards the boathouse, “is intimate. It’s not a stranger’s portrait. I want everything on the boy. Friends, enemies, lovers. I want to know who saw him like that, laughing. Who would have had that image of him seared into their mind?” He looked at Fraser’s wide, earnest eyes. “And I want a list of every art student, every professional artist, every gallery owner in Inverness and the surrounding area. Anyone with the skill to do… that. Especially portraitists. Start with the art college. Someone there will have heard of an artist this good.”

Fraser nodded, already typing into his phone, the task giving him a renewed sense of purpose, a shield against the weirdness of it all. “Right, Sarge. On it.” He hesitated. “What do you think happened to the hands?”

Gash stared out at the water, the same grey, indifferent water he had been rowing on. “He’s keeping them,” Gash said, the certainty of it settling like a stone in his stomach. “The painting gets the soul. But he keeps the hands. The part of the boy that could create, that could connect with the world. He’s taking everything.”

He left Fraser to his work and walked back into the boathouse one last time before the SOCOs would hermetically seal it off from him. Thorne was now quietly conferring with his team, pointing out minute details on the floor. Gash ignored them. His attention was held captive by the portrait. The boy on the canvas was so alive he seemed to breathe the turpentine-laced air. Gash felt a strange kinship with the killer’s obsession, a dark echo of his own need for control, for the perfect rhythm of the stroke, the perfect silence. This killer’s art was murder, his rhythm the slow, meticulous staging of a corpse. He was an artist of death, and this boathouse was his first gallery exhibition. Gash knew this was a challenge. It was a declaration. And as he finally turned to leave, the laughing eyes of the painted boy seemed to follow him, a silent, beautiful accusation that would haunt him until he found the monster who had loved him to death.The drive back to the main police headquarters on Old Perth Road was a study in contrasts. Outside the windows of Gash’s unmarked Ford, Inverness was coming to life. Schoolchildren in bright blazers laughed on street corners, delivery vans rumbled past cafes steaming up their windows, and the first wave of tourists were already aiming their cameras at the castle on the hill. It was a city scrubbed clean by the morning, utterly oblivious to the artful horror decaying in the boathouse. Inside the car, the silence was as thick and cold as the river fog. Fraser sat ramrod straight in the passenger seat, staring ahead, his untouched coffee growing cold in the cup holder. Gash drove with a heavy, deliberate precision, his big hands gripping the wheel, his mind replaying the scene: the serene face of the dead boy, the explosive life of the painted one, the obscene emptiness of the blood-stained cuffs.

They entered the station through the rear, bypassing the public entrance. The atmosphere inside was already charged. Word had travelled faster than they had. The open-plan office, usually a low hum of keyboards and quiet phone calls, had a new, nervous energy. Heads turned as Gash strode through, his expression a thundercloud that warned away any questions. He didn't stop until he reached the glass-walled office of Detective Chief Inspector Isla Ross. She was already standing, a phone pressed to her ear, her face a mask of controlled urgency. She was a small, sharp-featured woman with a reputation for being as unforgiving as a Highland winter. She saw Gash, gave a curt nod, and finished her call with a clipped, “I’ll call you back.”

“Tell me it’s not as bad as Fraser’s panicked phone call made it sound, Gash,” she said as he entered, her voice devoid of any real hope. She gestured to a chair, but Gash remained standing, too large and restless for the confines of her neat office.

“It’s worse, ma’am,” he said. He laid it all out in his blunt, sparse prose. The location, the victim’s identity, the careful staging. He described the painting, the quality of the work, the wet paint. He finished with the detail he knew would define the entire investigation. “The body was laid out post-mortem. Dr. Thorne’s preliminary view is death by poisoning or suffocation, something quiet. Afterwards, the killer amputated both hands at the wrist. Cleanly. Took them with him.”

Ross’s carefully maintained composure finally cracked. She sank into her chair, her eyes wide. “He took the hands? Why in God’s name…?” She looked at Gash, her expression shifting from shock to the hard-edged pragmatism of a senior officer. “The press will have a field day. ‘The Inverness Artist’. Something bloody ghoulish like that. We need to lock this down, now. I want a total media blackout. Liam Robertson is a missing person until I say otherwise. Understood?”

“He’s a murdered boy laid out as a piece of art, ma’am,” Gash countered, his voice a low rumble. “And the artist is a genius who wanted to be found. This isn’t a crime of passion; it’s a performance. He’s telling us something.”

“Speculation, Sergeant,” Ross snapped, though her voice lacked its usual steel. “What I need are facts. Evidence. Fraser,” she called, her gaze flicking to the young constable hovering in the doorway, “get that list of artists and art students started yesterday. I want names, addresses, and specialities. I want to know who in this city is capable of painting like a Dutch Master and thinking like a psychopath. The rest of the team will start on Robertson’s life. Digital footprint, phone records, friends, enemies, last known movements. The full workup.” She looked back at Gash. “You’ll coordinate. This is your case. Don’t make me regret it.”

Gash nodded, the command a pointless formality. It was already his case. It had been his the moment he saw the painting. There was one piece of business left, the part he dreaded more than any other. “I’m going to see the parents.”

Ross looked up, a flicker of something human in her eyes. “Are you sure? It might be better coming from a Family Liaison Officer.”

“They need to hear it from the man who’s going to find him,” Gash said, the word ‘him’ referring not to the dead boy, but to the killer. He turned, his mind already on the quiet suburban street he would have to darken with his news. He jabbed a thumb at Fraser. “You’re with me, lad. Time you learned what this job is really about.”The Robertson’s house was in Crown, a quiet, respectable neighbourhood of Victorian stone villas and manicured gardens. A child’s bicycle lay on its side on the lawn, a bright red splash of innocence against the grey stone. It felt obscene to be bringing such darkness here. Fraser fidgeted beside him as Gash pressed the bell, the cheerful chime echoing in the sudden silence. The man who answered the door was tall and gaunt, his face a roadmap of sleepless anxiety. He had Liam’s dark hair, but his was shot through with grey, his eyes red-rimmed and hollow.

“Mr. Robertson? Alistair Robertson?” Gash asked, though he knew the answer. “I’m Sergeant Gash, this is Constable Fraser. Can we come in?”

Alistair Robertson just nodded, his throat working silently, and stepped back into a hallway that smelled of beeswax and fading hope. A woman appeared from a doorway that led to a living room, her hands twisting a tea towel. Elspeth Robertson was small and bird-like, her face puffy from crying, but a desperate, frantic energy still radiated from her. “Is it about Liam? Have you found him? Is he alright?”

Gash’s heart, a heavy, accustomed stone in his chest, sank a little further. He looked from her pleading face to her husband’s terrified stillness and found himself wishing, for a moment, that Ross had sent the FLOs after all. “Perhaps we should sit down,” he said gently.

In the living room, surrounded by a lifetime of family photos – Liam on his first day of school, Liam grinning with a string of fish, Liam awkward in a suit at a wedding – Gash delivered the news. He did not soften it or dress it up in euphemism. He had learned long ago that a clean wound, however deep, was better than a ragged one. “Mr. and Mrs. Robertson… we found Liam this morning. I’m so very sorry. He’s passed away.”

The sound Elspeth made was not a word. It was a raw, primal noise of tearing, the sound of a life being ripped in two. She collapsed into herself, Alistair catching her, his own face crumbling as he held his wife, their shared grief a terrible, private storm in the middle of their neat living room. Fraser, pale and rigid in the corner, looked as though he might be sick. Gash gave them a moment, his gaze fixed on a framed photo on the mantelpiece. In it, Liam was laughing, head thrown back, a flush of sun on his cheeks. Gash felt a jolt, a sickening sense of recognition. It wasn't the exact same pose as the painting, but the spirit was identical. The sheer, explosive joy.

When the first wave of shock had receded into shuddering sobs, Gash cleared his throat, hating himself for what he had to do next. “Mrs. Robertson… I know this is an impossible time. But I need to ask you some questions.” Elspeth looked up, her eyes vacant. “This photo,” Gash said, nodding towards the mantelpiece. “Who took it? When was it?”

Alistair answered, his voice thick. “Last summer. We were on holiday. Skye. His mother took it. Why?”

“Did Liam have any friends who were artists? Painters? Anyone he was spending a lot of time with recently, someone who might have wanted to paint his portrait?” The question hung in the air, bizarre and intrusive.

Elspeth’s brow furrowed, a flicker of confusion in her grief-stricken eyes. “An artist? No… I don’t think so. He was a good lad. All his friends were… you know, normal boys. Into football, video games.” She trailed off, then a thought seemed to strike her. “There was one… a new friend, from the past few months. Liam didn’t talk about him much. Said he was a bit… intense. Met him at the Aquadome, I think. He was a student, Liam said. At the art college.”

“Do you remember a name?” Gash asked, his focus sharpening.

She shook her head, tears starting anew. “Liam just called him Mac. He said Mac was brilliant. That he saw things differently.” She looked at Gash, her expression utterly lost. “He’s dead? My boy? Who would do this? Why?”

Gash had no answers for her. Not yet. He stood up, his presence feeling like a violation in this shattered home. “We’re going to find out who did this,” he said, the words a vow. “I promise you that.”

Back at the station, a major incident room had been established. Whiteboards were already covered in spidery writing, a photo of Liam – the happy, official one provided by his parents – pinned at the centre like a target. The place thrummed with the grimly efficient energy of a murder investigation finding its feet. Gash bypassed it all, heading for his own desk, Fraser trailing in his wake like a dinghy behind a trawler. The younger man was silent, his face still ashen from the visit.

“Get the name of every student at the Inverness College UHI with the nickname ‘Mac’ or a name that could be shortened to it,” Gash ordered, his voice rougher than he intended. “Start with the fine arts department. Cross-reference it with the list of portrait artists you’re already making. Get me the social media for every single one of them. And get me the CCTV from the Aquadome for the last six months. Go.” The string of commands was a lifeline, and Fraser grabbed it, nodding jerkily before almost running to his own desk, grateful for the cold, impersonal nature of the task.

Gash sat down heavily, the worn springs of his chair groaning in protest. He stared at his own computer monitor, where a crime scene photographer had emailed him a high-resolution image of the painting. He zoomed in on the face. It was magnificent. The artist had captured a fleeting moment of pure, unadulterated life and made it eternal. He had seen the boy, truly seen him in a way a parent’s loving snapshot never could. The artist hadn’t just painted Liam; he had laid a claim on him. He had seen that vibrant life and decided it belonged on his canvas, and nowhere else. The body was just the leftover clay, the vessel from which the soul had been scraped.

He toggled to another image: a close-up of the severed wrists. The clean cuts, the primly tucked, empty cuffs. The hands. He kept coming back to the hands. Why take them? An artist’s hands create. A musician’s hands play. What did Liam Robertson, a normal boy who liked football, do with his hands? Gash pulled up a list of Liam’s school activities and part-time jobs. He’d worked in a cafe. He played guitar in a local band with his friends. They were called ‘North of Nowhere’. They had a few videos on YouTube, grainy footage from a pub gig. Gash clicked on one. And there was Liam, on a small stage, his face serious with concentration, his hands a blur of motion on the fretboard of an acoustic guitar, coaxing a surprisingly complex, beautiful melody from the instrument. They weren't just hands. They were the source of his art.

A throat cleared behind him. It was Fraser, holding a tablet. “Sarge. I think I’ve got something.” His voice was tight with excitement. “I started with the art college register. There’s only one final-year painting student called ‘Mac’ as a known nickname. His name is Cormac Croft. He’s noted as the department’s star pupil. Specialism: hyper-realistic portraiture. A genius, according to his tutors. A bit of a loner. Intense.” Fraser swiped the screen, showing Gash a page from the college’s online gallery. It was a self-portrait by Cormac Croft. The style was unmistakable. The same brutal clarity, the same unnerving vitality as the painting of Liam. But it was the next image that made the air in Gash’s lungs turn to ice. Fraser had pulled up Cormac Croft’s public Instagram profile. The most recent post, from three days ago, was a candid shot of Liam Robertson, sitting in a cafe, laughing. The exact moment. The exact angle. The exact light as the painting in the boathouse. The caption underneath it was a single, chilling word: ‘Mine.’The single word hung in the charged air of the incident room like a particle of dust caught in a sunbeam, small, insignificant, yet holding the focus of the entire space. *Mine.* It was a word of possession, of supreme, arrogant ownership. It was a signature scrawled across a life. For a full three seconds, there was absolute silence. Then Gash moved, and the room exploded. He was on his feet, his chair scraping back with a violent screech. He didn't shout, his voice was a low, controlled roar that cut through the office chatter like a blade.

“Get me a warrant. Now,” he snapped at the nearest detective. “Address for a Cormac Croft. I want a tactical team ready to go in five minutes. Fraser, you’re with me. Ross,” he said, already moving towards the DCI’s office, not waiting for her to come to him, “I’ve got him. We’re going in.”

Isla Ross met him at her door, her face a thunderclap. “On the strength of a nickname and an Instagram post, Gash? That’s thin. The procurator fiscal will–”

“The post is a photograph of the victim identical to the pose in the murder tableau, uploaded three days ago with the caption ‘Mine’. The suspect is the art college’s star pupil specialising in the exact style of the painting. His name is Cormac, the nickname is Mac, and Liam Robertson told his mother he’d met an intense art student called Mac. It’s not thin, ma’am. It’s a bloody confession. And if we wait for the paperwork to be perfect, he’ll be gone, and we’ll be looking for another boathouse with another body in it. Your call.”

She stared at him, her jaw tight, then gave a sharp, decisive nod. “Go. Get him. I’ll handle the fiscal. Don’t, for God’s sake, let this go sideways.”

The convoy of two unmarked cars and a black tactical response van sliced through the midday Inverness traffic, their blue lights clearing a path of startled motorists. Gash sat in the passenger seat of the lead car, silent, his gaze fixed forward, his big frame coiled with a predatory stillness. Fraser drove, his knuckles white on the steering wheel, his earlier investigative excitement replaced by the taut, adrenalized fear of imminent conflict. They were no longer discussing theories or following digital breadcrumbs. They were hunting a monster in his lair, and the abstract horror of the morning was about to become terrifyingly concrete. Gash could feel the engine’s vibration through the floor, a counter-rhythm to the frantic pounding in his own chest. This was the part of the job that was like his rowing, a moment of pure, violent focus where the rest of the world fell away.

Cormac Croft’s address wasn’t a student flat or a suburban semi. It was a converted warehouse on the industrial outskirts of the city, overlooking the dark, sluggish waters of the Caledonian Canal. It was a place of isolation, of brick and rusted steel, with large, north-facing windows perfect for an artist. The tactical team, clad in black and armed with carbines, stacked up by a heavy steel door on the second floor landing. Gash stood behind the shield of the point man, his own service pistol heavy in his hand. The team leader gave a three-count on his fingers, and then the ram struck the door with a deafening crack. The door shuddered but held. The second strike shattered the lock, and the team flooded in, shouting “Armed police!” into the sudden, cavernous space. Gash followed, sweeping his eyes over the room, the smell hitting him instantly. Turpentine, linseed oil, and the faint, clean scent of bleach. The flat was empty.

It was one vast room, a studio and living space combined. And it was immaculate. A bed was made in one corner with military precision. Books on art history, human anatomy, and chemistry were stacked in neat piles. On one side of the room, under the huge windows, was the artist’s setup. An easel, identical to the one in the boathouse, stood empty. A taboret held a perfectly organised array of brushes, palette knives, and tubes of paint. There was no chaos, no sign of a frenzied mind. The place hummed with a cold, unnerving discipline. It was the workspace of a man utterly in control. Gash felt a chill that had nothing to do with the unheated space. This was the dark mirror of his own world, the same fanatical order applied to an obscene purpose.

Fraser let out a choked gasp from the other side of the room. Gash turned to see him standing before a wall that was a shrine to Liam Robertson. It was covered in corkboard, and pinned to every inch of it were images of the boy. Long-lens photographs of him walking to school, laughing with friends outside a pub, staring thoughtfully out of a bus window. Screenshots of conversations, candid pictures stolen from his life. And sketches. Dozens of charcoal studies of his face from every angle, his expression captured in moods from joy to contemplation. And then Gash saw it: a series of exquisitely detailed anatomical drawings of hands. Liam’s hands. On a guitar fretboard, holding a coffee cup, resting on a book. The artist had not just admired the boy; he had studied him, dissected him on paper long before he had done so in reality. He had deconstructed him into a collection of beautiful parts.

Gash’s eyes scanned the pristine studio, his mind racing. Where would he keep them? It wouldn’t be careless. It would be deliberate. It would be part of the ritual. His gaze fell upon a small, sleek, stainless-steel cabinet in the corner, the kind used for medical or scientific storage. It had a digital lock and a quiet hum that spoke of refrigeration. “Get that open,” he ordered one of the tactical officers, who produced a set of tools. It took less than a minute. As the door swung open, a cloud of cold vapour drifted out. Gash pushed past the officer and looked inside.

The horror was quiet, ordered, and absolute. On a series of small, velvet-lined shelves, as if they were priceless sculptures, were the hands. Liam’s hands were on the top shelf, pale and perfect, preserved with a chemical sheen that made them look like wax. They were positioned carefully, palms up, the fingers slightly curled, as if in offering. But Gash’s breath caught in his throat, a sharp, painful intake of air. They weren’t alone. On the shelf below, resting on a separate velvet cushion, was another pair of hands. They were older, the skin more delicate and paper-thin, the nails long and painted a faded, pearlescent pink. A woman’s hands. He knew, with a certainty that felt like a physical blow, that the crime scene at the boathouse was not a beginning. It was an escalation.

“Sarge…” Fraser whispered, his face the colour of ash as he stared into the cabinet. “It’s not just him.”

Gash didn’t reply. He was staring at the woman’s hands, at the way one finger wore the faint indentation of a ring long since removed. This changed everything. They weren’t hunting a man who had committed a single, obsessive murder. They were hunting a collector. A serial killer who had been operating under the radar, perfecting his monstrous craft in silence. The boathouse wasn’t his first piece; it was simply the first time he had hung his work in a public gallery. He was finished with hiding. He wanted an audience. He wanted acclaim. And looking at the artful, terrible display in the refrigerated cabinet, Gash understood with a chilling clarity that the killer had chosen him to be his primary critic. The game had not just begun; it had been going on for a long time, and he was only now being invited to play.The cold that rolled out of the open cabinet was different from the river’s. It was a sterile, technological cold, a cold that spoke of preservation and absolute control. Gash stood motionless, the professional clamour of the tactical team fading into a distant hum. His world had narrowed to the small, refrigerated stage inside the steel box. Liam’s hands, so recently coaxed into a facsimile of life by the artist’s brush, were now inert objects, catalogued. But it was the other pair, the woman’s hands, that held him captive. They were beautiful in their own way, slender and pale, the skin like old parchment. They suggested a life lived with a certain grace, a life of gestures now frozen in time. The indentation on the ring finger was a ghost of a commitment, a faint circle of history that Cormac Croft had deemed unimportant, or perhaps, had deliberately erased.

“Sarge?” Fraser’s voice was a ragged whisper. “Who… who is she?”

Gash finally tore his eyes away, a muscle twitching in his jaw. “She’s our real victim, Fraser,” he said, his voice a low, gravelly thing. “She’s the one we never even knew was missing.” He turned to the tactical team leader, who was watching him with a practiced, impassive gaze. “This is a forensic scene now. Seal it. I want Thorne and his entire team here. Every surface, every fibre. Croft may be gone, but he left this for us. He wants us to see it. He wants us to see them.” He was already pulling out his phone, stepping away from the open cabinet as if its sterile cold could somehow contaminate him. He walked towards the huge, north-facing window, the grey light of the canal reflecting in his eyes, making them look like chips of granite. He dialled DCI Ross’s number. She answered on the first ring.

“You have him?” Her voice was tight, expectant.

“We have his studio. He’s gone,” Gash said, cutting straight to the point. “He knew we were coming. The place is clean. Too clean. But he left a gift.” He paused, choosing the words with grim care. “Ma’am. It’s not just Liam Robertson. The hands we were looking for… they’re here. Preserved. And so are another pair. A woman’s. Older. This isn’t a beginning. We’ve walked in halfway through the collection.” Silence stretched down the line, so profound Gash could hear the faint static of the connection. When Ross finally spoke, her voice was stripped of all its usual authority, leaving only a cold, sharp blade of fury. “Get back here, Gash. Bring everything you have. I’m clearing the boards. This is now Operation Cennad, and God help us all.” Cennad. The old Gaelic word for a messenger, a collector of tales. Ross had a flair for the dramatic, but this time, it felt chillingly appropriate. Cormac Croft was sending them a message, telling a story in dissected parts.

Back at Old Perth Road, the incident room was a place transformed. The mood had shifted from the focused urgency of a single murder to the vast, sprawling dread of a hunt for a ghost. Liam’s smiling photo was moved to the side, and in the centre of the main whiteboard, under the heading ‘Operation Cennad’, a SOCO photograph of the woman’s hands was pinned. They looked pale and surreal against the clinical blue of the evidence bag, objects utterly detached from the person they belonged to. Gash stood before the board, a mug of black, scalding tea in his hand, feeling its heat do nothing to warm the chill that had settled deep in his bones. Ross had been true to her word, widening the net with terrifying speed. Detectives were already on the phone with counterparts in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh. The search parameters were being drawn up: missing women over the last five years, no body found, no ransom demanded, just vanished. The ring indentation was the only personal detail they had.

Dr. Thorne arrived in the incident room looking, for the first time in Gash’s memory, slightly ruffled. He carried a tablet computer and approached Gash and Ross with an air of academic gravity. “The preservation is remarkable,” he began, without preamble, swiping through a series of high-resolution images of the hands. “He’s used a combination of formaldehyde solution for initial fixing, followed by a glycerol-based fluid for long-term preservation and to maintain tissue pliability. It’s museum-quality work. He’s not just a painter; he has a sophisticated understanding of chemistry and anatomy.” He stopped on an image showing a microscopic view of the tissue. “DNA from both sets of hands is good. Liam’s is obviously a match. We’re running the woman’s through the national database now, but unless she has a criminal record or is in the system for some other reason, it may not give us a name. We need a familial match.”

“What about time of death? Or time of… acquisition?” Ross asked, her arms crossed tightly.

Thorne shook his head. “Impossible to say with any accuracy from the preserved tissue alone. The process halts decomposition entirely. But based on the slight desiccation and the chemical absorption levels, I’d offer a very rough estimate. The woman’s hands were taken at least a year ago. Perhaps longer. He’s been doing this for a while, Sergeant. Quietly. Methodically.” Thorne’s professional admiration was palpable, and Gash found it deeply unsettling. Cormac Croft wasn’t just a killer; he was a peer in his own dark field. He was an expert.

Leaving Ross to direct the widening gyre of the investigation, Gash retreated to his desk. He felt a desperate need for the quiet mechanics of his old world, for the simple rhythm of dip, pull, release, feather. But that world was gone. In its place was this new, complex rhythm of death. He pulled up the image of Croft’s self-portrait from the college website. The artist stared out from the screen with an unnerving intensity. He was young, handsome in a severe, angular way, with dark eyes that seemed to see right through the viewer. There was a supreme confidence in his gaze, an arrogance that bordered on contempt. It was the face of a man who believed his vision of the world was the only one that mattered. He didn't destroy beauty; he captured it, perfected it, and stored it away from the decaying influence of life itself. The body was a flawed, temporary vessel. The painting was eternal. The hands were the proof of his conquest, the symbol of the creative power he had stolen and claimed as his own.

A young detective, her face earnest and pale, approached his desk. “Sarge? We’ve got a first pass on missing persons in the Highlands and Islands from the last two years. There’s a possible. Woman named Morven Ross. No relation to the DCI,” she added quickly. “Fifty-six years old. A piano teacher from Nairn. Disappeared eighteen months ago. Left a note saying she was unhappy and was leaving to start a new life. Husband was cleared, case went cold. She was known for never taking off her wedding ring.” Gash straightened up, the exhaustion falling away, replaced by the cold, sharp rush of the hunt. He looked from the detective’s hopeful face to the self-portrait of Cormac Croft on his screen. Morven Ross. A piano teacher. A woman whose life was defined by the art she created with her hands. The pattern was no longer a theory. It was a brutal, elegant, horrifying certainty. Gash grabbed his keys. “Get Fraser,” he said, his voice flat and hard. “We’re going to Nairn. We’re going to talk to a widower.”The fifteen-mile drive east from Inverness to Nairn followed the coastline, the grey expanse of the Moray Firth a constant, brooding presence to their left. Fraser drove this time, his earlier, twitchy energy having subsided into a grim, focused silence. He was learning. The initial shock was being replaced by the dull, heavy armour of professional necessity. Gash sat beside him, watching the landscape shift from industrial estates to rolling farmland and then to the neat, stone-built houses of the seaside town. He felt the journey as a descent, a movement backward in time into the killer’s history. They were no longer chasing a man; they were excavating a life, and the layers of soil were the years of Cormac Croft’s terrible, secret apprenticeship. This quiet drive was a world away from the frantic violence of the raid on the studio, but it felt more dangerous, more profound. It was here, in the quiet lives of his victims, that the real nature of the monster would be revealed.

Nairn presented a face of peaceful, respectable retirement. The air was clean and sharp with salt, and the streets were tidy, lined with guest houses and sturdy Victorian villas. It was a town that felt insulated from the ugliness of the world, a place of golf courses, sea walks, and quiet contemplation. The darkness they were bringing here felt like a physical contagion. Ewan Ross lived in a modest, immaculately kept bungalow a few streets back from the seafront. The garden was tidy, the windows were clean, but a stillness hung over the place, the quiet of a house that held its breath. As Gash and Fraser walked up the short path, Gash noticed a single magpie strutting on the lawn. One for sorrow. He was not a superstitious man, but the sight settled in his gut like a cold stone.

The man who opened the door was in his late sixties, with a kind, weathered face and sad, blue eyes that had already seen their share of grief. He was wearing a worn cardigan and slippers, a man settled into a quiet life of solitude. When Gash introduced himself, a flicker of tired confusion crossed Ewan Ross’s face. The police had not had cause to visit him in over a year. “Is this about…?” He couldn’t finish the sentence, couldn't bring himself to say his wife’s name in that context. Gash’s expression was answer enough. “Please, come in,” Ross said, his voice suddenly hoarse as he stepped back to let them pass.

The inside of the house was a shrine to an absence. It was tidy to the point of being sterile, but everywhere were traces of the woman who had lived there. Sheet music was stacked neatly on side tables, a faint scent of lavender polish hung in the air, and in the corner of the living room, commanding the space, stood a beautiful upright piano, its dark wood polished to a high sheen. It was clear Ewan Ross had not let his wife’s memory gather dust. He gestured for them to sit, but remained standing himself, his hands clasped together, a man bracing for an impact he could not comprehend. Gash did not waste time. He laid out the new, terrible truth with the same grim economy he had used with the Robertsons, explaining that the theory of his wife leaving had been tragically wrong.

Ewan Ross didn’t collapse or cry out. His reaction was a slow, silent implosion. The colour drained from his face, leaving it a waxy grey. He staggered back and sank into an armchair, his breath coming in short, shallow gasps. He had mourned his wife’s abandonment, a grief laced with betrayal and confusion. Now he was being asked to mourn her murder, a grief of pure, undiluted horror. “But… the note,” he whispered, looking at Gash with desperate, pleading eyes. “She wrote that she was unhappy. That she needed to leave.” Gash suspected, with a sickening certainty, that Croft had likely forged the note, another artistic flourish in his grand, cruel composition. “We believe the circumstances of her disappearance were not what they seemed,” Gash said, the official language feeling hollow and inadequate. “Mr. Ross, I need to ask you about your wife. About her work. She was a piano teacher?”

A single tear traced a path down Ewan’s cheek. He nodded, his gaze drifting to the silent piano. “She was more than that. She was a musician. It was her life. Her hands…” He stopped, his voice cracking. “They were her gift. She could make that old thing sing. She said the music didn’t come from the notes on the page, but from somewhere deeper. From the soul, through the fingers.” Fraser, standing by the window, flinched as if struck. Gash felt the words land with the force of a physical blow. The soul on the canvas, the hands in the cabinet. Croft hadn’t just stolen parts of his victims; he had stolen the very things they and their loved ones considered the source of their essence.

“Did she have many students?” Gash pressed gently. “Any new ones, in the months before she disappeared? Anyone who stood out?” Ewan shook his head slowly. “Her regulars, mostly. Children from the town. A few adults.” He paused, his brow furrowed in concentration, searching the clouded waters of his memory. “There was one… not a student, not really. A young man. He came to her a few months before she… left. He wasn’t interested in learning to play. He said he was an artist. He wanted to understand music, to understand the passion. He said he wanted to paint it.” The memory seemed to trouble him. “Morven was flattered. He was very intense, but brilliant. He’d sit in on her lessons, just watching her hands, sketching in a notebook. She said he had an old soul.”

“Do you remember his name, Mr. Ross?” Gash asked, his voice steady, betraying none of the fierce certainty that was now roaring in his chest. “Did he have a nickname, perhaps? Mac?” Ewan’s eyes widened slightly in recognition. “No, I don’t think so. He was always very formal. Cormac. His name was Cormac.” Gash pulled out his phone and brought up the self-portrait from the college website. He held it out to Ewan Ross. “Is this him? Is this Cormac?” Ewan stared at the screen, and a look of dawning horror and understanding washed over his face, a new, more terrible grief erasing the old. “Yes,” he breathed. “That’s him. The prodigy. He painted her portrait.”

The air in the room became heavy, thick with unspoken dread. “He painted her?” Gash asked. “Do you still have the painting?” Ewan Ross nodded numbly, rising from his chair like a man in a trance. “She was so proud of it. He gave it to her, a week before she vanished. A gift for her time, he said. It’s in my study.” He led them down a short hallway into a small, book-lined room. And there, on the wall opposite the desk, it hung. It was Morven Ross. Not the frail ghost of a memory, but a woman in her prime, seated at her piano, her face illuminated by an unseen light, her eyes closed in a moment of pure, ecstatic connection with her music. Her hands, those precious, gifted hands, were a blur of graceful motion above the keys. The brushwork, the vibrant palette, the soul-stealing realism—it was all there. It was a masterpiece. A study in obsession, an act of possession rendered in oil and pigment.

Gash and Fraser stood in silence before the painting, the truth of Cormac Croft’s ritual laid bare. He did not just kill and discard. He observed, he worshipped, he immortalised. And then he replaced his subject with his own, perfect version, leaving it behind as a monument to his genius and a final, mocking insult to the bereaved. This portrait was not a clue; it was a ghost, a beautiful lie left to haunt this quiet house while the real Morven’s hands lay on a velvet shelf in a cold steel box. Gash looked from the vibrant life on the canvas to the broken man standing beside him. Croft hadn’t just taken a life; he had curated a memory, forcing a husband to live with an idol while he kept the relics. As they finally turned to leave the silent, grief-stricken house, Gash felt a new, terrifying urgency. This was the pattern. This was the hunt. And somewhere out in the city, or the Highlands, or beyond, Cormac Croft was already sketching his next subject, beginning his terrible, intimate process all over again.The drive back from Nairn was a silent, grim procession. The beauty of the coastline, the white-capped waves rolling onto the sand, the vast, open sky – it all seemed like a mockery, a painted backdrop for a scene of profound human ugliness. Gash stared out at the water, but he wasn’t seeing it. He was seeing the two portraits, side by side in his mind’s eye. Morven Ross, lost in the ecstasy of her music; Liam Robertson, exploding with the joy of youth. Cormac Croft had not chosen his subjects at random. He was a connoisseur of passion, a collector of souls at the very peak of their expression. He was a vampire feeding not on blood, but on the ephemeral moment where talent and life force burned brightest. The murders were not the point; they were a necessary, practical step in the process of acquisition. The art was the point. The preservation was the point. He was building a museum of stolen moments.

Fraser, to his credit, kept his eyes on the road, his silence born not of fear this time, but of a deep, sorrowful comprehension. He had seen the look on Ewan Ross’s face. He had seen the beautiful, lying portrait on the study wall. The abstract horror of the boathouse had solidified into a repeatable, understandable formula, and that understanding made it infinitely more terrifying. They were no longer dealing with a monster who erupted in violence. They were dealing with a predator who planned, who courted, who created, and who then, with the meticulous care of a watchmaker, disassembled a human being, keeping only the parts he valued. The rest, the grief, the broken families, the empty houses, was just discarded material, irrelevant to his grand project.

When they walked back into the incident room, the atmosphere was electric with grim purpose. A large photo of the Morven Ross portrait, emailed from Fraser’s phone, was already being pinned to the central whiteboard, next to the portrait of Liam. Side by side, they formed a diptych of stolen life, a testament to the killer’s consistent, terrible vision. DCI Ross met Gash halfway across the room, her face hard and set. “We have a name, we have a face, and we have a pattern,” she said, her voice low and sharp, for his ears only. “I’ve made the call. His face is going public. National news. Every port, every airport. He’s the most wanted man in Scotland as of five minutes from now.”

“He’ll see it as a review,” Gash rumbled, his gaze fixed on the two paintings on the board. “A favourable one. This is what he wanted. He didn’t stay hidden for a year because he was scared. He was perfecting his technique. The boathouse was his coming-out party.”

“Let him enjoy his bloody exhibition,” Ross snapped. “He’s a cornered animal now, not an artist.” Gash wasn’t so sure. An animal cornered will lash out, but Croft was something else. He was a creature of supreme control. He would not panic. He would adapt. He would see this as the next phase of his performance, the moment the audience finally understood the scope of his genius. He walked to his desk through the hum of activity, feeling like the only one in the room who truly understood the nature of the man they were hunting. He sat heavily in his chair and stared at his screen, where he had pulled up both portraits. The pianist and the guitarist. The masters of their instruments, their hands the conduits for their art. The pattern was so clear, so elegant in its cruelty. Who was next? A sculptor? A surgeon? A watchmaker? Anyone whose hands held a creative, world-shaping power.

As he stared, an alert popped up in the corner of his screen. A new email. The subject line was three simple words: *For the Sergeant.* His heart, which he had thought a cold, heavy lump of machinery, gave a sudden, painful lurch. It was an internal email, from the general IT support desk, but the message header indicated it had been bounced from an external, untraceable server, flagged as suspicious and forwarded to him based on the subject. His hand was not entirely steady as he moved the mouse and clicked it open. The message was short, the text clean and formatted with the precision of a published author. There was no greeting.

*You have a discerning eye, Sergeant Gash. Better than the others. They saw a body; you saw a composition. They saw a crime; you saw a critique. I was beginning to despair of finding a worthy audience.*

*You found Morven. I’m impressed. Her portrait was an early work, a study in capturing kinetic grace. I’ve improved since then, as I’m sure you’ll agree. Liam’s piece has a much more vibrant energy. One must always be honing one’s craft.*

*I find myself in need of a new subject. The inspiration for the next work in the series is a man who does not create beauty from nothing, like a musician, but finds it trapped in the raw material of the world. He finds the angel in the marble, so to speak, though his medium is humbler. Wood. He takes the fallen and gives it a new, more perfect life. A kindred spirit, in many ways. I think you’ll appreciate the textures.*

*Consider this the programme notes for my next exhibition. I do hope you’ll attend the opening.*

There was no signature. There didn’t need to be. Gash read the email three times, the blood roaring in his ears, a cold sweat breaking on his brow. It was a taunt. A manifesto. A love letter from a monster to his critic. And it was a death sentence. *He finds the angel in the marble... his medium is wood.* A woodcarver. A sculptor. Somewhere in or around Inverness, a man who worked with wood was being watched, studied, and worshipped by Cormac Croft. The killer had not gone to ground. He hadn’t fled. He was out there, right now, moving toward the next piece in his collection. He hadn’t just invited Gash to the game; he had made him a player. The message was clear: *I have chosen my next victim. I am telling you who he is. Now, try and stop me.* Gash slammed his fist on the desk, the impact rattling his monitor, the controlled rage he rowed out onto the river every morning erupting in the sterile quiet of the station. The race was no longer a metaphor. It was real, and it had just begun.The sound of Gash’s fist connecting with the laminated particleboard of his desk was a gunshot in the cathedral quiet of the incident room. It was a raw, percussive crack of splintering wood and bruised knuckles that cut through the low hum of keyboards and hushed phone calls, silencing everything. Every head in the room snapped towards him. In that sudden, profound stillness, Gash was the epicentre, a monolith of barely contained violence. He stood frozen for a half-second, his own knuckles throbbing, his breath burning in his chest, shocked by his own loss of control. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, the mask of stony impassivity slid back into place. He straightened up slowly, deliberately ignoring the dozens of stares, and looked directly at DCI Isla Ross, who was already moving towards him, her face a mask of sharp, questioning alarm.

Without a word, he turned his monitor so she could see the screen. He watched her eyes, sharp and quick as a hawk’s, scan the email. He saw her read it once, then a second time, her expression hardening from concern to a cold, controlled fury. The colour drained from her cheeks, but her voice, when she spoke, was pure steel. “He’s still here. And he’s telling us what he’s going to do next.” She turned to the room, her voice ringing with an authority that seized the shattered quiet and forged it into a weapon. “Listen up! The manhunt is now a rescue operation. The target has communicated. He is planning his next kill. The victim is a woodworker, a sculptor. Someone who works with wood as an art form.” She pointed to the board where the portraits of Liam and Morven hung. “He hunts artists. He collects them. We are now looking for every professional wood artist, carver, sculptor, and turner in the Highlands. Every gallery, every craft council, every artisan market. I want a list, and I want it an hour ago. Go!”

The room erupted. The stunned silence was replaced by a frantic, directed chaos. Phones were snatched up, keyboards clattered with renewed ferocity, and the low hum of the investigation became a high-pitched roar of desperate purpose. Gash felt a hand on his arm and turned to find Ross looking at him, her eyes dark with a new, shared burden. “He spoke to you, Gash. Why you?” she asked, the question less an accusation and more a search for understanding. Gash stared back at the two portraits on the wall, the vibrant life trapped in the amber of oil paint. “Because I’m the only one who didn’t look away from the painting,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “I’m the audience he craves.” He felt a profound sense of violation, as if Croft had reached across the digital ether and laid a cold, proprietary hand on his shoulder.

He walked away from the clamour, needing space, needing air. He found himself by a window overlooking the car park, the ordinary sight of rain-slicked tarmac and commuter cars feeling alien and distant. The world of his single scull, of the pure, silent mechanics of his body against the water, felt like a dream he’d had a lifetime ago. Croft had taken that from him, too. He had invaded Gash’s discipline with his own dark, meticulous art. The email wasn’t just a taunt; it was an invitation into the killer’s mind, a place of cold aesthetic logic and terrifying beauty. He had to enter that mind to stop him, but he was afraid of what he might find there, what dark reflections of his own need for control and order might be waiting for him in the killer’s psyche. He was a policeman. His job was to stand on the wall that separated order from chaos. But Cormac Croft wasn’t chaos. He was a different, more terrible kind of order.

Fraser appeared at his elbow an hour later, his face pale with fatigue but his eyes bright with the thrill of the chase. He was holding a tablet, the screen glowing. “Sarge, the lists are a mess. There are hundreds of names. Hobbyists, retired joiners, people who carve little wooden birds for tourist shops.” He swiped through a seemingly endless database of names and addresses. Gash shook his head, his mind locking onto the phrasing of the email. *A kindred spirit. Finds the angel in the marble.* “He’s not interested in hobbyists, Fraser. He’s arrogant. He sees himself as a genius. He’d only be interested in a peer. Someone with a reputation, someone with passion. Forget the craft fairs. Look for the zealots. The recluses. The ones the art blogs write about in hushed tones. Find me the artist, not the craftsman.”

Fraser nodded, his fingers flying across the screen, his search terms becoming more specific, more esoteric. He cross-referenced gallery catalogues with art critic reviews and blog posts. Minutes stretched into a tense, thrumming silence between the two men. Then, Fraser stopped. “Oh,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “Sarge, look at this.” He held out the tablet. It showed a long-form article from an obscure online art journal, published a year ago. The headline was ‘The Bodach of the Black Isle’. A photo showed a gnarled, white-bearded man standing beside a sculpture of a leaping salmon so lifelike it seemed to twist in the air. The man’s eyes were pale and fierce, and his hands, resting on the wood, were like knots of oak root, powerful and ancient. “Alistair MacLeod,” Fraser read. “Lives alone in a self-built cabin in the Drumsmittal woods. Works only with storm-fallen trees. Refuses to sell his work through galleries, but collectors and critics make pilgrimages to his workshop. Listen to this quote from him, Sarge: ‘The wood is already alive with its final form. It has a soul from its life as a tree, a history written in its grain. My job isn’t to create. It is to listen, and to release what is already there.’”

Gash felt the blood in his veins turn to ice water. *He takes the fallen and gives it a new, more perfect life.* It was a perfect match. A poet-sculptor living in the woods of Gash’s own childhood. A man who fit the killer’s twisted philosophy like a key in a lock. He snatched the tablet from Fraser, his eyes scanning the text, his mind racing. There was no address, only a vague description of a remote track leading into the woods. No phone number. MacLeod was a ghost, a local legend. He was the perfect, isolated target. Cormac Croft could already be there, sitting in the man’s workshop, sketching his hands, drinking in his passion, the first steps in his ritual of immortalisation and death.

He strode back to Ross’s desk, the tablet held out like a warrant. “This is him. Alistair MacLeod. A wood sculptor on the Black Isle.” He laid out the chilling parallels, the quotes from the article echoing the killer’s own words. Ross listened, her face grim. “The tactical team can be ready in twenty minutes. We’ll need a chopper to locate the cabin from the air.” Gash shook his head, the decision forming in his mind with absolute clarity. “No. Too much noise, too much force. If Croft is there, he’ll kill him the second he hears a helicopter. This has to be quiet. This is personal. He wants me to come. He wants me to be the first to see his new work.” He looked at her, his expression leaving no room for argument. “Give me Fraser and a car. I know those woods. I can get there without a bloody parade.”

Ross held his gaze for a long moment, a battle playing out in her eyes between protocol and Gash’s brutal, undeniable instinct. Finally, she gave a short, sharp nod. “Go,” she said. “Find him, Gash. Bring the old man out. And bring me the artist.” Without another word, Gash turned, grabbing his heavy coat from the back of his chair. The race had a finish line now, a tiny, isolated cabin somewhere in the dark heart of the Black Isle. He jabbed a finger at Fraser, who was already on his feet, his face a mixture of terror and determination. “You’re with me, lad. Let’s go.” As they walked out of the humming incident room and into the cold, rain-swept evening, Gash felt a strange sense of purpose settle over him. The killer had chosen the location. He had chosen the victim. He had chosen his audience. Now, Gash was going to write the final act.The Kessock Bridge rose before them, a harp of steel and cable strung across the dark waters of the Beauly Firth. The lights of Inverness dwindled behind them, a smear of gold and white against the bruised purple of the twilight sky. Ahead lay the Black Isle, a looming mass of shadow, its familiar silhouette now seeming alien and menacing. Rain lashed against the windscreen, the wipers beating a frantic, hypnotic rhythm that did little to soothe the tension inside the car. For Gash, this crossing was a violation. He was bringing the filth of his job home. This peninsula of rich farmland, quiet villages, and dark, ancient woods was the landscape of his youth, the place he had fled and the place that had formed him. He had rowed its coastline, fished its waters, and walked its forests. Now, it was the hunting ground of a killer who perverted the very idea of creation, and Gash was driving into its heart not as a son, but as an executioner. He felt the phantom weight of his oars in his hands, the memory of the clean, cold rhythm a distant echo from a life that no longer seemed to belong to him.

They left the main A9 and plunged into a labyrinth of single-track roads, the car’s headlights carving a tunnel through the suffocating darkness. The rain intensified, drumming on the roof and turning the narrow lane into a slick black ribbon. Gash navigated the twists and turns from memory, his hands steady on the wheel, his eyes scanning the verges. He knew this land, its dips and rises, the way the road flooded near the old mill, the sharp turn hidden by a stand of Scots pine. Beside him, Fraser was a statue of coiled anxiety, his gaze flicking between the road and the dense, dripping forest that crowded in on either side. The trees were no longer just trees; they were a screen, a hiding place, a silent congregation of witnesses. Every snapped twig, every rustle of unseen life in the undergrowth, was a potential prelude to horror. Gash could feel the younger man’s fear, a sharp, metallic taste in the close confines of the car, and it fed his own cold, hardening resolve.

“Here,” Gash said, his voice a low growl. He pulled the car into a muddy, overgrown track that was little more than a break in the trees, killing the engine and the lights. The sudden plunge into absolute darkness and silence was shocking. The drumming of the rain on the roof was the only sound. “We walk from here. It’s another mile, maybe more, through the woods. Stay close. No talking. Watch my signals.” He pulled a heavy, high-powered torch from the glove box but didn’t turn it on. He didn’t need it yet. He moved with a surprising grace for a man of his size, slipping out of the car and into the dripping embrace of the trees. The air was thick with the scent of wet earth, pine needles, and decay—the smell of the forest’s slow, constant digestion of itself. Gash moved with a hunter’s quiet confidence, his feet finding sure purchase on the slick ground, his shoulders brushing past wet ferns without a sound. He was an apex predator returning to his territory, and he was hunting a rival.

After twenty minutes of near-silent walking, Gash stopped, holding up a hand. Fraser froze behind him, his breathing ragged. Through the trees ahead, maybe a hundred yards away, a light flickered. It was a warm, yellow, unsteady light, not the harsh white of an electric bulb. An oil lamp. It was a pinprick of humanity in the vast, indifferent darkness of the woods. Smoke, thin and pale, curled from a stone chimney, its scent barely perceptible over the smell of the rain. Gash felt his heart hammer against his ribs, a frantic, trapped thing. They weren’t too late. Or, they were too late for the victim, but not for the artist. He was there. He was working. Gash drew his pistol, the click of the safety catch unnaturally loud in the quiet. He motioned for Fraser to do the same, then pointed to his left, indicating a flanking manoeuvre. He would take the front, Fraser the side. They moved with excruciating slowness, two ghosts slipping between the ancient trees, their goal the small, glowing cabin that now felt like the centre of the universe.

Gash reached the edge of the clearing and crouched behind the massive trunk of a fallen oak. The cabin was exactly as the article had described it: built of thick, interlocking logs, with a turf roof that made it look as though it had grown out of the forest floor. It was a place of quiet strength and solitude. But the single window, its glass beaded with rain, glowed with a sickening warmth. Gash crept forward, his back pressed to the log wall, until he was beside the window frame. He took a deep, steadying breath, then risked a glance inside. The scene was a perfect, horrifying echo of the boathouse, but more intimate, more sacred. The old man, Alistair MacLeod, lay on a thick bed of fresh, pale wood shavings in the centre of the room, as if he had been laid to rest in the heart of his own art. His face was peaceful, his great white beard resting on the chest of a clean flannel shirt. The cuffs were tucked at his sides. They were empty. And just beyond him, his back to the window, stood Cormac Croft. He was in front of a large easel, illuminated by the glow of two oil lamps. In one hand he held a palette, in the other, a fine-tipped brush. He was leaning forward, his head cocked with intense concentration, dabbing a speck of white onto the canvas—a glint of light in the eye of the man he had just killed.

The quiet, meticulous scrape of the front door’s iron latch was the only sound that broke the spell. It was the sound of the outside world intruding on a sacred space, the critic entering the gallery. Cormac Croft didn’t startle, didn’t spin around in alarm. He simply completed his brushstroke with a steady, deliberate hand, then carefully placed his brush and palette on the taboret beside him. He turned slowly, not with the panicked motion of a cornered criminal, but with the calm, measured grace of a man who had been expecting a visitor. He wiped his fingers on a clean rag, his eyes adjusting to the two dark shapes framed in his doorway. A slow smile spread across his face, a smile of genuine, intellectual pleasure. His dark eyes found Gash’s, and the recognition was instant, a spark jumping across the small, lamp-lit space. "Sergeant Gash," he said, his voice a smooth, cultured tenor that held no trace of fear, only a warm, welcoming satisfaction. "You made it. I was hoping you would. Please, come in. You're just in time to appreciate the finished piece."Gash stepped over the threshold, his boots sinking into the soft bed of wood shavings that carpeted the floor. The scent was overpowering, a holy trinity of the killer’s world: the sharp, resinous perfume of freshly worked pine, the acrid bite of turpentine, and the faint, sweet, coppery tang of death. Fraser followed a step behind, a pale spectre with a trembling handgun, his gaze fixed on the serene, white-bearded man lying in state. But Gash’s eyes were locked on Cormac Croft. He saw the flicker of pride in the killer’s expression, the look of a creator eager to receive praise for his magnum opus. The room was a diabolical inversion of a nativity scene, with a dead saint in the manger and a self-satisfied devil presiding over his work.

“You have to admit, the composition is superior to the boathouse,” Croft continued, his voice calm and conversational, as if they were discussing the weather. He gestured with a paint-stained hand towards the tableau. “The raw textures of the wood shavings provide a much more organic cradle for the subject than the sailcloth. More honest. Alistair understood that. He understood that beauty comes from the material itself.” He took a step towards the easel, his eyes shining with feverish passion. “And the portrait… I think I’ve truly captured him. Not the frail old man he was becoming, but the spirit inside him. The Bodach. The creative force. He’s not dead, Sergeant. He is complete.”

“On your knees, Croft,” Gash said, the words grinding out from between his teeth. He advanced slowly into the room, his pistol held steady in a two-handed grip, a solid, black extension of his will. “Hands on the top of your head. Now.” The command was flat, devoid of emotion, a line of cold iron drawn in the charged air. Fraser, emboldened by Gash’s advance, moved to the side, his own weapon tracking Croft, creating a crossfire. But Croft seemed not to have heard, or simply not to care. He turned his back on them completely, an act of such breathtaking arrogance it momentarily stunned Gash. He faced his painting, his head tilted in final, loving appraisal.

“They never understand the hands,” Croft mused, speaking to the canvas as much as to the men behind him. “They think it’s a trophy. A vulgar signature. It’s so much more poetic than that.” He trailed a clean finger along the frame of his masterpiece. “Morven’s hands created fleeting, transient sounds that vanished into the air. Liam’s, the same. Alistair’s… his were the most dangerous. They created things of substance, things that would last, but they were still imperfect. They were rivals.” He finally turned back to face them, a look of profound, almost sorrowful, pity on his handsome face. “Their art was flawed because it was tied to their decaying bodies, to their fleeting lives. My art is eternal. To create it, I must first stop their inferior creation. I don’t destroy them, Sergeant. I release them from their flawed, temporary craft and elevate them into a permanent one. I take their hands so they can create no more imperfections. I take their soul and I make it perfect. It is an act of profound love. Surely, a man of your discipline can appreciate that.”

It was the word ‘discipline’ that broke Gash. It was a wire, stretched taut between the two men throughout the entire investigation, and Croft’s use of it, his claiming of it, made it snap. In that instant, Gash saw it all: the cold god of the river, the metronomic slide of the seat, the pure mechanics of the stroke—his own fanatical, desperate search for a quiet, ordered world. And he saw this man, this monster, who had built his own world of perfect, terrible order on a foundation of human lives. He was not a kindred spirit. He was a mockery. A blasphemy. With a roar that was torn from the deepest, most primal part of his soul, Gash lunged. It was not the move of a policeman. It was the charge of a great, wounded bear. He covered the ten feet between them in two powerful strides. Croft’s look of surprise was almost comical, the serene philosopher suddenly confronted with a reality he had not painted.

Gash’s shoulder hit him square in the chest, lifting him off his feet. The impact was a brutal, jarring collision of flesh and bone. They crashed backwards, Croft’s easel splintering beneath them, the magnificent portrait of Alistair MacLeod tumbling to the floor. Paint pots and brushes flew through the air. The two oil lamps wobbled, their light dancing manically across the walls, before one crashed to the floor, its flame instantly extinguished. Gash was all weight and fury, his hands finding Croft’s throat, not to choke, but to hold, to pin him to the floor amidst the wreckage of his art. He looked down into the killer’s wide, shocked eyes, and for the first time, he saw not a god, but a petulant, surprised young man. The performance was over. Fraser rushed forward, yanking Croft’s arms behind his back, the sharp ratchet of the handcuffs echoing in the sudden, panting silence of the cabin.

Croft didn’t struggle. As Fraser hauled him to his feet, he simply looked at Gash, a flicker of genuine hurt in his eyes. “You ruined it,” he whispered, his voice aghast. “It was a perfect scene.” Gash slowly got to his feet, his chest heaving, his entire body trembling with the receding adrenaline. He ignored Croft. He looked at the dead man, peaceful on his bed of wood. He looked at the overturned painting, the face of the laughing Bodach now lying askew in the shavings. He looked at the mess of a crime scene he had created. He had won. He had stopped the artist. But the gallery was still there, a permanent exhibition in his own mind. He had stared into the heart of Cormac Croft’s beautiful, awful world, and he knew he would never be able to fully look away. The silence he sought on the river was gone, replaced by the ghost of a killer’s whisper, and the quiet part of his life was well and truly over.The journey back from the Black Isle was a descent into a new kind of silence. The frantic, hunting quiet of the drive out had been replaced by the dead, sterile quiet of a specimen in a jar. Fraser drove, his hands locked on the wheel, his eyes fixed on the rain-swept road ahead as if it were the only solid thing in a world that had dissolved into madness. Gash sat in the back with Cormac Croft. The killer was cuffed, his hands in his lap, but he sat with an easy, untroubled posture, his gaze directed out the window. He was not a prisoner being transported; he was a critic observing a landscape. As they crossed the Kessock Bridge, the lights of Inverness sprawling before them, Croft finally spoke, his voice a calm, reasonable murmur in the dark. “It’s a shame, you know. The way a city smudges the darkness. All that light pollution. You lose the stars. You lose the sublime.” Gash said nothing, his own silence a heavy, suffocating blanket. He could feel Croft’s presence beside him not as a physical threat, but as a psychic contamination, a voice that had taken up permanent residence in the quietest corners of his mind.

Their arrival at the station was an event. The moment they stepped from the car into the garish, strobing lights of the rear parking bay, a hush fell over the assembled officers who had been waiting for a glimpse. Croft walked between Gash and Fraser with his head held high, a small, curious smile on his face as he took in the scene. He was not a shuffling, defeated criminal; he was an exhibit being unveiled. As he was led through the main incident room, the entire floor fell silent. Keyboards stopped clicking. Phones were put down. Every eye was on the handsome, composed young man who looked more like a visiting academic than the monster who had haunted their every waking moment. Croft’s gaze swept the room, taking in the whiteboards covered in his life’s horrific details, and when his eyes found the portraits of Morven and Liam pinned side-by-side, his smile widened. It was the look of an artist seeing his work hung in a prestigious gallery for the first time. He had his audience at last. DCI Ross met Gash by her office, her eyes flicking from Croft’s serene face to Gash’s grim, rain-soaked form, his bruised knuckles, and the dangerous stillness in his eyes. She said nothing about the obvious signs of a struggle, the shattered protocol. Her words were clipped, professional. “He’s all yours, Sergeant. The interview room is ready. Find out where he put the old man’s hands.”

Before the interview, Gash locked himself in a small, tiled bathroom down a quiet corridor. He leaned over the basin, the porcelain cold under his palms, and splashed icy water on his face again and again, as if he could wash away the grime that had settled not on his skin, but in his soul. He looked at his reflection in the cheap, streaked mirror. The face that stared back was his own, but altered. The lines around his eyes were deeper, his mouth a hard, unforgiving slash. He was the man who had charged across a room and throttled a suspect, who had smashed a crime scene to pieces out of a rage so profound he hadn’t known it was in him. The cold discipline he had cultivated for a lifetime had fractured, and in the cracks, something raw and volcanic had looked out. He knew he should take another officer into the interview, for procedure, for safety, for his own sanity. But he also knew, with an unshakeable certainty, that this was a conversation for two. It had been ordained from the moment he first saw the painting in the boathouse. This was the final act, and he would face the artist alone.

The interview room was a grey, soundproofed box designed to strip a person of all context and comfort. It had no effect on Cormac Croft. He sat opposite Gash, his cuffed hands resting calmly on the metal table, and observed his surroundings with a mild, intellectual curiosity. Gash placed a recording device on the table, the small red light blinking into life like a single, watchful eye. He began the ritual, the cold liturgy of the law. “This is a formal interview being conducted at Inverness Police Headquarters. The time is 22:47 on Tuesday, October 24th. Those present are Detective Sergeant Gash and… for the recording, please state your full name.” Cormac Croft leaned forward slightly, a helpful, engaging expression on his face. “Cormac Alasdair Croft.” He spoke the name as if announcing a winner. Gash continued, the procedural questions a litany meant to build a cage of facts around the horror. Croft answered every question politely, his tone even, his gaze never leaving Gash’s face. He seemed to be enjoying the process, indulging the Sergeant in his quaint, necessary little game before the real conversation could begin.

“Let’s move on from the formalities, Cormac,” Gash said, his voice a low, flat rumble that absorbed all the light in the room. He leaned forward, his forearms resting on the table, creating a closed, claustrophobic space between them. “I don’t want to talk about where you were. I want to talk about why. Why Morven Ross?” The question was a key, turning a lock in Croft’s mind. His detached politeness fell away, replaced by an eager, professorial zeal. He was no longer a suspect; he was a master giving a lecture. “Morven was a study in sound,” he began, his eyes unfocusing as he looked back into his memory. “Her gift was immense, but tragically ephemeral. She would create these exquisite, intricate structures of harmony and melody, and in the next instant, they would be gone, vanished into the air. Nothing but a memory in the listener’s ear. It was a beautiful tragedy. I knew I had to take that transient beauty and make it permanent. I had to give her music a body, a form that would not decay.” He looked at Gash, searching for understanding. “The portrait is the music, Sergeant. It is her soul, made visible and eternal. Can you see that?”

Gash let the silence hang for a moment, refusing to validate the grotesque philosophy. He simply stared, his face an impassive mask, letting Croft’s ego rush to fill the void. “And Liam Robertson?” he asked, his voice unchanged. A shadow of something softer, almost tender, crossed Croft’s face. “Ah, Liam. He was different. He was not about structure; he was pure, unadulterated life force. A supernova. He burned so brightly. To watch him laugh, to watch him play that guitar with such careless, joyful abandon… it was like watching a star burn itself out. I knew I couldn’t let that energy just dissipate. It was too precious.” He leaned forward again, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “I gave him a gift, Sergeant. A mortal boy of seventeen, his entire life a headlong rush towards mediocrity, old age, and death. I took him at his absolute peak, the most beautiful, vibrant moment of his existence, and I made it last forever. He will always be that laughing boy. I saved him from the ugliness of time. That wasn’t murder. It was an act of mercy.”

“And the hands, Cormac,” Gash said, the words heavy and cold as lead. “Let’s talk about the hands. Morven’s, Liam’s, Alistair’s. They weren’t in the portraits. You took them. Why?” Croft’s expression shifted subtly, a veil of privacy descending over his features. He leaned back in his chair, a flicker of disappointment in his eyes, as if Gash had asked a crude, unsophisticated question. “The hands are a practical matter. A point of artistic integrity,” he said, his tone becoming didactic. “They are the instruments of their flawed, temporary art. A pianist’s hands, a guitarist’s hands, a sculptor’s hands… they create things that are bound to time, to decay, to imperfection. My art transcends that. To complete the subject’s elevation, to fully transfer their essence into the perfected form of the portrait, the rival instruments must be silenced. Removed. It purifies the process.” He paused, then offered a small, magnanimous smile. “They are not destroyed, of course. I’m not a barbarian. They are preserved. They form a separate collection, an appendix to the main body of work. A study of form and function. You saw them. The cabinet in my studio. It is a library of silenced tools.”

The interview was over. Croft had confessed to everything, not with remorse, but with a fierce, burning pride. He had meticulously documented his own genius for them, offering up the locations of the missing hands and the details of his chemical processes with the detached air of a scientist publishing his findings. As two uniformed officers came to lead him to a holding cell, Croft paused at the door and looked back at Gash, who had not moved from his seat. “You see now, don’t you, Sergeant?” he said, a look of genuine connection in his eyes. “The discipline. The obsession. The need to impose a perfect order on the chaos of the world. We are not so different, you and I. We simply chose different media.” Then he was gone, leaving Gash alone in the humming silence of the grey room. Croft’s final words hung in the air like poison gas, seeping into him, finding purchase in the darkest corners of his soul. He sat there for a long time, the blinking red light of the recorder the only movement, the only sign that time had not stopped altogether. The case was closed. The monster was caged. But Gash felt no victory, no relief. He had looked into the abyss, and the abyss had looked back and called him by name. He finally rose and walked out of the station, not towards his car, but into the cold, cleansing rain. He walked through the sleeping city, his feet carrying him, by instinct, towards the river. He stood on the damp bank, looking at the black, churning water of the Ness. He had come here for silence, for peace. But the silence was broken now, filled with the echo of a madman’s logic. The cold was no longer a god. It was just the miserable, empty air of his new, haunted life.The pre-dawn light was not the familiar ink of possibility anymore; it was the colour of a day-old bruise. Gash stood on the floating pontoon of the rowing club, the air cold and still, the silence profound. But it was no longer his silence. It was a shared silence, occupied by the ghost of Cormac Croft. He ran a hand over the smooth, cold hull of ‘The Morrigan’, his fingers tracing the contours of the carbon fibre as if it were the face of a stranger. The familiar pre-row ritual, the checking of the riggers, the setting of the foot stretchers, felt hollow, the actions of an automaton mimicking a life it once had. Everything was the same, and yet nothing was. The peace he had come here to find, the clean, mechanical exhaustion he craved, had been stolen from him. The boathouse, his confessor, was now a crime scene in his memory, its quiet sanctity forever violated.

He pushed off from the pontoon, the boat gliding out onto the flat, black water. The first stroke was a conscious, deliberate effort, a command sent from a distant brain to unwilling muscles. Dip. It felt wrong, the blade entering the water with a slight, clumsy splash instead of a clean, silent slice. Pull. There was no power, no connection to the coiled strength in his legs and back, just a brute, joyless heave. Release. The oars came out thick with water, heavy and unbalanced. Feather. His hands, usually so deft, so certain, fumbled the motion, the spoon catching the surface and sending a spray of icy water into his lap. He grunted, a sound of pure frustration, and tried again. He forced the rhythm, counting it out in his head, trying to drown out the voice that echoed there. *Discipline. Order. We are not so different, you and I.* The metronome in his mind was broken, its steady beat replaced by the cadence of a killer’s philosophy.

Each stroke became a battle. He tried to focus on the mechanics, on the feeling of the seat sliding beneath him, the burn in his quads, the solid lock of the oar in the water. But his mind, once a silent passenger on these journeys, was now a loud and insistent saboteur. He saw the laughing face of Liam Robertson, not on a canvas, but shimmering on the dark surface of the river. He saw the ecstatic, closed eyes of Morven Ross reflected in the city lights blurring on the bank. He felt the weight of Alistair MacLeod’s stolen life dragging on the hull. He was not rowing out the grime of his job; he was rowing through it, trapped in a viscous current of memory and horror. The water was no longer a cleansing element; it was a solution, saturated with the things he was trying to escape. The cold was not a god demanding tribute; it was just the damp, miserable chill of a man utterly, profoundly alone with his ghosts.

In a surge of pure, desperate rage, he abandoned form entirely. He began to haul on the oars with all the brute strength he possessed, his technique dissolving into a frantic, splashing chaos. He was no longer a sculler; he was a galley slave trying to outrun a tidal wave, each stroke a guttural roar of denial. He pulled and pulled, the boat lurching and yawing, his lungs searing, his vision narrowing to a grey, misty tunnel. He rowed until sweat poured down his face, mingling with the rain and the river spray, until his muscles screamed in agony and his hands were raw on the grips. He rowed until there was nothing left but a burning emptiness, a physical void that finally, mercifully, silenced the voice in his head. He stopped, shipping the oars, and slumped over, his great chest heaving, his breath coming in ragged, painful sobs. The Morrigan drifted aimlessly in the current, spinning slowly, a tiny, lost thing in the vast, indifferent gloom. He had won the physical battle, but he knew, with the chilling certainty of absolute defeat, that he had lost the war. His sanctuary was gone.

The incident room was quiet later that morning, the manic energy of the hunt replaced by the low, bureaucratic hum of its conclusion. Reports were being typed, evidence logged, timelines finalised. It was the orderly, procedural end to a saga of obscene, meticulous disorder. Gash sat at his desk, staring at a blank report template on his screen, a mug of cold tea untouched beside his keyboard. He was clean, showered, changed into a fresh shirt, but he felt as though the filth of the forest cabin was still under his fingernails, the smell of pine and blood still clinging to his clothes. He had not slept. Every time he closed his eyes, he was back in the lamplight, watching a master at his terrible work. Fraser approached his desk tentatively, a sheaf of papers in his hand. “Sarge? The preliminary forensics from the cabin are back. And the procurator fiscal wants your final statement for the initial charging document.” Gash just nodded, not looking up. He reached for the papers, his hand feeling heavy, disconnected, an instrument that no longer quite obeyed his will.

“You look like you’ve been wrestling with the devil and lost, Gash.” DCI Ross was standing by his desk, her arms crossed, her expression a careful mixture of professional assessment and something approaching concern. She didn’t wait for an answer. “The brass are ecstatic. The media are having a field day with their ‘Highland Hannibal’. They’re calling it a textbook arrest. You’re getting a commendation.” The words, meant as praise, landed like stones. A commendation for what? For seeing himself in a monster? For breaking down in a forest and nearly beating a man to death? He finally looked up at her, his eyes red-rimmed and hollow. “It’s not over,” he said, the words a rough, scraped sound. “In here,” he tapped his temple with a thick finger, “it’s not over.”

Ross held his gaze, her own eyes unblinking. She pulled up a chair and sat down, a surprising, intimate gesture. “No,” she said quietly. “For you, it’s just beginning. I’ve booked your mandatory debrief with the psych team for this afternoon. And I’m putting you on compassionate leave for two weeks, effective immediately.” Gash flinched as if she’d slapped him. “No,” he said, his voice hard. “I’m not talking to a shrink, and I’m not going on leave. Leave is for sitting at home. Leave is for thinking. I need to work.” He gestured around the quiet, orderly office. “This is all I’ve got left.” The admission hung in the air between them, raw and stark. His discipline, his sanctuary, his mind—all had been compromised. Only the job remained.

She studied him for a long time, the pragmatist in her weighing the broken man against the effective officer. She saw the danger signs, the brittleness behind the granite facade. Sending him home to wrestle with his demons alone was a risk. Keeping him here was a different kind of risk. Finally, she sighed, a small, frustrated sound. “Fine. No leave. But you’re on desk duty until I say otherwise. And you are going to that debrief, Gash, or I’ll suspend you. That’s not a request.” She stood up, her decision made. She walked to a filing cabinet in the corner of the room, pulled out a thin, dog-eared blue folder, and dropped it on his desk. It landed with a soft, unremarkable thud. “This is your new case.”

Gash stared at the file as if it were a venomous snake. The label was handwritten: ‘Stolen Goods - MacBain’s Engineering’. He looked up at Ross, his expression a mixture of confusion and insult. “You’re putting me on a petty theft? A stolen generator from a worksite?” he asked, his voice laced with disbelief. “Ma’am, with all due respect–” Ross cut him off, her voice sharp as broken glass. “Respect is earned by following orders, Sergeant. The Croft case is closed. It’s over. You need to let it be over. You won’t find any grand philosophies in that file. No art, no tortured geniuses, no dark reflections of your own soul. You’ll just find a greedy, predictable little scrote who saw an opportunity and took it.” She leaned down, her face close to his, her voice dropping to a low, intense command. “Go be a policeman, Gash. A proper one. Go find the simple, ugly, boring truth. Go put the world back in order, one stolen generator at a time. It’s all we can do.” She turned and walked away, leaving him alone with the thin blue folder, a flimsy shield against the epic, beautiful horror that was still playing out behind his eyes. He slowly reached out and opened it, the mundane reality of it a cold shock. A list of stolen tools. A blurry CCTV still of a man in a hoodie. It was ugly. It was simple. And it was, perhaps, the only thing in the world that could save him.For a long time, Sergeant Gash simply stared at the blue folder. It was an object of profound, almost offensive, banality. The corners were soft and frayed, a coffee ring had stained the top right corner, and the handwritten label was a messy, indifferent scrawl. Inside, the typed words were a litany of the mundane: one diesel generator, three nail guns, a Kango hammer, assorted power tools. The estimated value was a few thousand pounds. The crime scene was a muddy, half-finished building site on the Longman industrial estate. The victim was a limited company. The motive, as plain and ugly as the cheap paper it was written on, was simple, grasping greed. After the symphonies of madness he had just endured, this was the equivalent of being forced to listen to a nursery rhyme on a loop. It was an insult to his intelligence, an insult to the scale of the horror he had just waded through. Ross had meant it as an anchor, but it felt like a lead weight, threatening to drag him down into a new kind of despair, the despair of crushing, absolute pointlessness.

Fraser approached the desk with the cautious deference of someone approaching a bear with a sore head. He had a fresh notebook and a pen poised, his expression one of earnest, professional readiness. The contrast between the young constable’s clean-slate energy and Gash’s own curdled exhaustion was stark. “Right, Sarge,” Fraser said, his voice quiet but clear. “MacBain’s Engineering. The file says the night watchman saw a white van leaving around 3 a.m., but the plates were caked in mud. I’ve requested traffic cam footage from all the main routes out of the estate. Thought we could head over, see the site for ourselves?” Gash looked up at him, at his keen, untroubled eyes, and felt a surge of something bitter and sharp. Fraser had seen the horror, too, but it had washed over him, a terrible storm that had now passed. For Gash, the storm had moved inside. He gave a single, grudging nod, pushing his chair back with a loud scrape. The movement was stiff, pained, the protest of a body that had found no rest and a mind that refused to let it.

The Longman industrial estate was a sprawling grid of corrugated metal sheds, chain-link fences, and rain-slicked asphalt. It was a place designed for pure function, utterly devoid of beauty or soul. Every building was a grey or beige box, every sign was a block of utilitarian text, every corner was stained with oil and rust. As they drove through it, Gash felt a sense of profound nausea. It was the absolute antithesis of Cormac Croft’s world. Croft had sought out natural beauty, human passion, places with history and meaning. This was a landscape of blank, brutal utility, a place where the only thing created was profit, and the only thing of value was its monetary worth. Croft would have despised this place, and Gash, in a twisted, horrifying moment of solidarity with the killer, found that he despised it too. This was the world he was supposed to put back in order, this soulless, ugly sprawl. It felt like being asked to tidy up a rubbish dump.

Ewan MacBain, the owner of the company, was a short, florid man with a bristling moustache and eyes that were permanently narrowed in a state of simmering fury. He met them at the gate of his building site, a patch of churned-up mud surrounding the skeletal frame of a future warehouse. He wasn’t grieving; he was incandescent. “About bloody time,” he snapped, forgoing any greeting. “D’you know how much that generator costs? D’you know what my insurance premiums are going to be now? This whole job is on hold. Every day this site is silent costs me thousands. I want these scumbags found, Sergeant. I want them crucified.” Gash listened to the tirade with a profound sense of detachment. He thought of Ewan Ross’s silent, soul-destroying grief, of the Robertson’s primal cry of loss. This man’s passion was for his balance sheet. His pain was an invoice. It was ugly and simple and it made Gash’s teeth ache.

He left MacBain ranting at Fraser and walked the site alone. The thieves had been crude. They had cut a section of the temporary fence, driven their van across the mud, and dragged the generator out, leaving a deep, gouged scar in the earth. The scar was just a scar. It wasn’t a compositional element. The discarded bolt cutters lying near the fence were just tools, not a statement. Everything was exactly what it was, and nothing more. Gash found himself scanning the scene for a hidden meaning, for a sign of artistic intent, for some echo of the meticulous staging he had become so intimately familiar with. He was looking for the artist’s hand in a brute’s work, and the desperate, foolish nature of the search filled him with a deep and weary self-loathing. He was a man who had stared at the sun and was now trying to read by its afterimage, seeing spots and phantoms where there was only mud and grit.

Back in the temporary site office, a cramped Portakabin that smelled of damp paperwork and stale coffee, MacBain played the CCTV footage. It was a single, fixed camera, and the quality was abysmal. A grainy, black-and-white image showed two figures, bulky in hooded sweatshirts and work trousers, manhandling the tools into the back of a van. Their faces were completely obscured by shadows and the low resolution. It was a dance of clumsy, thuggish effort. Gash watched the jerky movements, the way they fumbled with a heavy tool box, and the ghost of Cormac Croft’s voice whispered in his ear, a cool, academic critique. *No grace. No kinetic purpose. Just vulgar effort for vulgar gain.* Gash closed his eyes for a second, a wave of dizziness washing over him. This was Ross’s cure? Forcing him to watch this pathetic, ugly pantomime? It felt like torture. “Is that it?” Gash asked, his voice rough. “That’s the best you’ve got?” MacBain shrugged, his anger momentarily replaced by defensive indifference. “It’s a building site, not a bloody film studio. It’s just to put the shits up them.”

Just as Fraser was thanking the man and preparing to leave, Gash held up a hand. “Play it again,” he commanded, his eyes narrowed, fixed on the screen. “The second man. The one on the right. Zoom in as much as you can and loop the last ten seconds.” Fraser shot him a questioning look but complied, manipulating the playback controls. The image degraded further, dissolving into a mess of blocky pixels, but the man’s basic movements were still visible. He was wrestling a nail gun into the van, his back to the camera. He gets it in, straightens up slightly, and for a brief second, his left hand rests on the lip of the van. His face is invisible, his body a formless shape, but Gash saw it. A nervous, unconscious gesture. A rapid, three-beat tapping of his index, middle, and ring fingers against the metal panel. A drummer’s rhythm. A liar’s tell. An imperfection. It was the first thing he had seen all day that wasn’t just base-level fact. It was a human flaw, a crack in the anonymous facade.

He didn’t say anything to Fraser or MacBain. He let them finish, took a copy of the footage, and drove back to the station in silence. He retreated to his desk, ignoring the murmurs and the concerned looks, and isolated the tiny, two-second clip. He played it over and over, the three-beat tap a maddening, hypnotic loop on his screen. It was nothing. A tic. A meaningless habit. But it was a detail. It was a signature, not of a genius, but of a common, nervous little thief. He turned to his keyboard and pulled up the police database. He ignored the search fields for modus operandi and vehicle type. He opened the extensive library of interview footage, the millions of hours of criminals lying, confessing, fidgeting in grey little rooms just like the one he had shared with Croft. He started a search, the keywords feeling absurd as he typed them: “hand gestures,” “nervous tic,” “finger tapping.” It was a long shot, a search for a needle in a continent of haystacks. But it was a task. It was mechanical. It was data. It was ugly and simple and boring. As the system began to churn through the terabytes of information, Gash leaned back, the rhythmic tapping on his screen a new, unwelcome metronome. He was not finding peace. He was not healing. He was just replacing one obsession with another.The hours bled into one another, each one marked only by the changing light outside the station windows and the growing pile of discarded coffee cups on Gash’s desk. The incident room, having solved its grand, terrible puzzle, had largely moved on. Detectives spoke of other cases, other lives, their voices a low, normal hum that felt alien to Gash. He was an island, a man marooned in the glow of his monitor. On the screen, the grainy, two-second loop played relentlessly. Tap. Tap. Tap. A ghost’s frantic heartbeat. The database churned, its progress bar a tiny, crawling worm of hope in a vast desert of data. Fraser tried, periodically, to breach the perimeter of Gash’s self-imposed isolation. He brought lists of known fences, pawn shops that might have taken the tools, informants who specialised in the movement of stolen construction equipment. It was solid, methodical police work. It was the correct way to investigate this crime. Gash would just shake his head, his eyes never leaving the screen, and wave him away. He wasn’t investigating a theft anymore. He was hunting a ghost in the machine.

“Sarge,” Fraser tried again, late in the afternoon, his voice laced with genuine concern. “The system has been running for eight hours. It’s processed seventy percent of the archived interview footage in the entire Northern Constabulary database. Nothing. Maybe we should just… focus on the van? We’ve got a possible sighting near Aviemore.” Gash didn’t even turn. “No,” he said, the single word a wall of granite. He couldn't explain it, not even to himself. He couldn’t articulate that this wasn't about the generator anymore. This was a test. He had to know if he could still see the world, if his mind, rewired by Croft’s pathology, could still find a pattern, any pattern, in the chaos and make it mean something. If the tap was nothing, then he was nothing, just a man haunted by phantoms, seeing signs where there were only shadows. He had to prove to himself that the detail mattered.

He was deep into the ninth hour, his eyes burning, the repetitive motion on the screen having seared itself onto his retinas, when the system chimed. It was a small, unobtrusive sound, but in the quiet bubble of Gash’s obsession, it was as loud as a cathedral bell. A single file had been returned. *Match probability: 42%.* He clicked it open, his heart thudding with a slow, heavy beat. The video that loaded was ancient by digital standards, from over a decade ago. It was a low-quality recording of an interview for a string of petty burglaries from parked cars. The subject was a young man in his early twenties, wiry and pale, with darting, nervous eyes and a bad haircut. The interview was a study in pathetic denial. The young man fidgeted, he lied, he contradicted himself. And as the interviewing officer laid out a piece of irrefutable evidence, the young man’s left hand, resting on the table, performed a quick, unconscious, three-beat tattoo on the metal surface. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Gash leaned closer to the screen, his breath fogging a small patch on the glass. It was him. The same rhythm, the same nervous energy, the same pathetic little crack in the composure. It was the signature of a born loser. He pulled up the file. The man’s name was Kevin Ballantyne. A long, uninspired string of convictions for shoplifting, petty theft, and handling stolen goods. He had served a handful of short sentences, a revolving door of criminality that never escalated, never evolved. He was a bottom-feeder. Gash found his most recent mugshot. The face was older, puffier, the darting eyes now dulled by years of failure and cheap lager, but it was the same man. This was the artist who had painted the scar in MacBain’s mud. This was the antithesis of Cormac Croft. He wasn’t a supernova; he was a flickering, faulty fluorescent bulb in a damp cellar. Without a word, Gash stood up. He grabbed his coat and keys, the simple, decisive movements startling Fraser, who was dozing at his own desk. “Address for a Kevin Ballantyne,” Gash said, his voice rusty from hours of disuse. “Now. You’re with me.”

There was no isolated cabin, no grand studio. Kevin Ballantyne’s last known address was a grim, pebble-dashed flat in the Merkinch housing scheme, a part of the city that tourists never saw, a place of broken fences, satellite dishes, and a persistent, damp chill that seemed to rise from the concrete itself. A white van, its number plates caked in mud, was parked two streets away, tucked awkwardly behind a skip. It was almost too easy. Gash and Fraser didn’t need a tactical team or a silent approach. They walked up to the scuffed front door and Gash hammered on it with his fist. For a moment, there was no answer, only the sound of a television from within. Then, a frantic scuffling sound. Gash didn’t wait. He put his shoulder to the door. The lock, old and cheap, gave way with a splintering crack.

The scene inside was one of chaotic, squalid domesticity. The air was thick with the smell of stale cigarette smoke, unwashed clothes, and fried food. And there, in the middle of the small, cluttered living room, were the tools. The Kango hammer lay on a sofa cushion, one of the nail guns was on the floor next to a pile of pizza boxes, and the generator, a huge, yellow beast, dominated the room, an altar of petty crime. Kevin Ballantyne, skinny and bug-eyed with terror, was trying to scramble out of a back window. He wasn’t a predator; he was vermin, startled by the light. Fraser, moving with a newfound confidence, had him pulled back inside and cuffed before he could get a leg over the sill. Ballantyne didn’t fight. He began to cry, fat, silent tears rolling down his sallow cheeks. “It wasn’t my idea,” he blubbered, his voice a pathetic whine. “It was Dougie’s. He made me do it.”

Gash stood in the centre of the sordid room, the case closed, the culprit caught, the stolen goods recovered. He felt nothing. No triumph. No satisfaction. No relief. He looked at the sniveling, terrified little man being read his rights by Fraser. He looked at the stolen tools, monuments to simple, artless greed. He had been right. His obsession had paid off. The detail had mattered. He had found the flaw in the tapestry and pulled the thread until the whole shoddy thing had unravelled. He had proven he could still see. But the victory was as hollow and empty as the flat felt. This pathetic little crime, this sniveling little man—they were the truth of the world he was supposed to put back in order. Cormac Croft had shown him a world of terrible, transcendent meaning, a world where passion and beauty were worth killing for. This world, the real world, was about a stolen generator and a crying man in a dirty flat. Ross’s cure had worked, but not in the way she had intended. It hadn’t grounded him. It had shown him just how far he had to fall. He had exorcised the ghost of a genius, only to be left alone in a room with a fool. And as he turned to walk out of the flat and back into the cold, grey afternoon, he wasn't sure which was worse.The silence in the car on the way back from Merkinch was a dead weight, heavier and more suffocating than the tense quiet of the hunt. Fraser, in the driver’s seat, was practically vibrating with the low-frequency hum of a job well done. He had caught the scent of a clean, simple victory and was basking in it, the satisfaction rolling off him in palpable waves. He cleared his throat, unable to contain it any longer, his voice bright with a professional pride that felt like sandpaper on Gash’s raw nerves. He saw the world in solved cases and filed reports, a neat and tidy progression of problems and solutions. Gash now saw it as a gaping chasm between the sublime terror of a monster and the pathetic squalor of a fool, and he was dangling in the void between them.

“A good collar, Sarge,” Fraser said, glancing over. “That finger-tap thing… that was brilliant. Properly good police work. Old school. They’ll be talking about that one for a while.” Gash turned his head slowly and looked at the younger man, his face a blank mask that did not conceal the utter desolation in his eyes. Fraser’s smile faltered, the easy victory suddenly souring in the face of the Sergeant’s profound and terrifying emptiness. He saw that Gash had not returned from Merkinch with him. He had returned alone, from somewhere much farther away, and he had left a vital part of himself behind. Fraser fell silent, chastened, and for the rest of the journey, the only sound was the rhythmic squeak of the windscreen wipers pushing away the endless, indifferent rain. This was the result of his tutelage, Gash thought with a wave of bleak, internal irony. He had taken a keen young constable and shown him the abyss, and all the lad had learned was how to appreciate a good party trick.

He didn't file a report. He didn't debrief the team. He walked through the station, ignoring the congratulations and the curious looks, and dropped the thin blue folder, now containing the arrest report and signed confession from a sobbing Kevin Ballantyne, onto DCI Ross’s desk. It landed with a soft, final thud. She looked up from her screen, saw his face, and the flicker of a triumphant smile died before it could form. She had sent him to slay a mundane dragon, expecting him to return grounded, his feet firmly back on the solid earth of routine police work. The man standing before her was not grounded. He was adrift, his eyes holding the flat, dead light of a ship’s lantern on a windless, fogbound sea. He looked worse, far worse, than he had when he was hunting a genius. He looked like a man who had just discovered that nothing mattered.

“The generator is recovered. The suspects are in custody. They’re blaming each other. It’s a full confession,” he said, his voice a monotone, each word an effort. He had done the job she had given him. He had put the world back in order, one stolen generator at a time. And the order was ugly, meaningless, and suffocating. “Your desk duty is over, Gash,” Ross said, her voice softer now, her attempt at a cure having visibly failed. “But the rest of it isn’t. Dr. Morrison’s office. Top floor. Fifteen minutes. Don’t make me send Fraser to collect you.” He just nodded, the fight gone out of him, and turned, walking away from her desk with the slow, heavy tread of a man heading for his own execution. The commendation for catching Cormac Croft and the solved report for a stolen generator were just two different kinds of paperwork, and neither of them could staunch the bleeding.

The psychiatrist’s office was designed to be calming, a space of soft lighting, muted colours, and comfortable chairs. To Gash, it felt like a padded cell. He sat opposite a woman who introduced herself as Dr. Helen Morrison, a small, neat woman with intelligent grey eyes that seemed to miss nothing. She held a pen and a notepad, but she didn’t write, she just watched him, her stillness a mirror to his own hostile, barricaded silence. She let the silence stretch, a tactic Gash recognised and resented. It was a space for the patient to fill with his own anxiety, his own confessions. Gash had nothing to give but a wall. Finally, she began, her voice calm and even, a professional instrument designed to probe without alarming. She asked him about his sleep, his appetite, his relationships with his colleagues. He answered in monosyllables, his arms crossed over his chest, a great, granite boulder of a man refusing to be moved.

“Sergeant,” she said, her tone shifting slightly, becoming more direct, “I’ve read the preliminary reports on the Cormac Croft case. I’ve read your initial statement. It seems you established a… unique perspective on his methodology very early on.” Gash’s jaw tightened. Unique perspective. It was a clinical, bloodless term for the dark recognition that had chilled him to the marrow. “I’m a detective,” he grunted. “I detect. That’s the job.” Dr. Morrison gave a small, patient nod. “Of course. But Croft’s final message was addressed to you personally. He referred to you as a ‘worthy audience’. He spoke of a shared discipline. That must have been… unsettling.” Unsettling was not the word. It was a violation. It was the moment the monster had reached out of the darkness and declared them brothers. Gash said nothing, his gaze fixed on a point on the wall just over her shoulder, a small water stain shaped vaguely like the coastline of Skye.

She tried a different tack. “Tell me about the river, Sergeant. About your rowing.” This time, he flinched. It was a small, almost imperceptible tightening of the muscles around his eyes, but she saw it. He felt a surge of anger, hot and sharp. His rowing was his. It was the last pure, private thing he had, and this woman, with her gentle voice and her probing questions, was trying to pathologise it, to label it and file it away with the rest of his trauma. “It’s exercise,” he bit out, the words sharp and defensive. “It keeps me fit.” She let his anger wash over her without reaction. “DCI Ross mentioned you call it your confessor. What do you confess to it?” The question was a scalpel, sliding deftly under his ribs. He felt the air leave his lungs, the wall of his silence breached. He thought of the frustrations, the anger, the clinging grime of his job, all the things he churned into the water and left in his wake.

He finally looked at her, his eyes blazing with a desperate, cornered fury. “What do you want me to say?” he demanded, his voice a low, dangerous rumble. “That I understood him? That when he talked about obsession and control and the need for a perfect, ordered world, that a part of me, a dark little part of me, knew what he meant? That he took the one place I could find silence and he filled it with his goddamn art? Is that what you want to write on your little notepad?” He was on his feet now, his big frame filling the small room, his shadow falling over her. Dr. Morrison did not flinch. She simply looked up at him, her grey eyes filled not with fear, but with a deep, professional sadness. She had her answer. The crack in the granite was there. “No, Sergeant,” she said, her voice still impossibly calm. “I want to ask what you’re going to do now that your confessor is gone.” The question hung in the air, simple, profound, and utterly unanswerable. Gash stared at her for a long moment, the fury draining out of him, leaving a vast, hollow emptiness in its place. Without another word, he turned and walked out of the room, leaving the door open behind him, a silent admission of his own defeat.He didn’t go back to the station. He walked out into the grey, spitting rain of the afternoon and got into his car, the engine turning over with a tired, familiar rumble. He drove without thinking, his hands guiding the wheel through the city traffic by muscle memory alone, his mind a grey, featureless fog. He bypassed the turn-off for his flat, his gaze fixed on the road ahead as if he could outrun the question that Dr. Morrison had hung around his neck like a millstone. He found himself on the Kessock Bridge again, the city receding in his rearview mirror, the dark mass of the Black Isle looming ahead. This time, he wasn't hunting. He was running. He wasn’t running from Croft, not anymore. He was running from the quiet, padded room and the unanswerable question, from the hollow victory in a squalid flat, from the man in the mirror whose face he no longer recognised. He was a fugitive from his own life.

He didn't take the turn into the dark, inland woods. He stayed on the coast road, following the curve of the shoreline as it snaked north. He passed the turn-off for the rowing club, a place he now saw in his mind’s eye as a derelict, haunted building. He drove past the fertile fields and neat farmhouses, pushing further, towards the peninsula’s rugged, salt-scoured tip. The landscape grew wilder, the trees more gnarled and bent by the relentless wind. He ended up in Cromarty, a small, forgotten town huddled at the mouth of the Firth, its stone houses turning their backs to the grey, churning expanse of the North Sea. He parked by the harbour, the air that filled the car not the clean, fresh scent of the river, but a thick, elemental brew of salt, kelp, diesel fumes, and the oily, potent smell of fish. It was the smell of his youth. It was the smell of labour.

He walked along the stone pier, the wind plucking at his suit jacket, a garment that marked him as an outsider, a man of offices and courtrooms. A handful of fishing boats, scarred and stained with rust, bobbed in the choppy water, their rigging clattering a chaotic, tuneless rhythm against the masts. A group of old men, their faces like creased leather, sat on an upturned lobster pot, mending a vast, tangled net. Their hands, gnarled and calloused, moved with a slow, practiced economy, a different kind of artistry from the ones he had been forced to study. They were hands that repaired, that provided, that fought the sea for a living. They were the opposite of the hands in Croft’s refrigerated cabinet. One of the men looked up as Gash approached, his pale blue eyes, accustomed to scanning distant horizons, narrowing in recognition. He was a big man, stooped now by age but still possessing a formidable, heavy-boned frame. It was Murdo Macrae, the skipper of the last boat Gash had worked on before he’d traded his oilskins for a police uniform.

“Christ alive, is that you, Gash?” Murdo’s voice was a gravelly rasp, shaped by decades of shouting over engines and gales. “Lost your way from the big city? Or are one of my lads finally in trouble wi’ the law?” A dry chuckle ran through the other men. Gash managed a thin, weary smile. “Just driving, Murdo.” Murdo grunted, his gaze taking in Gash’s expensive suit, the exhaustion etched into his face, the profound, unshakeable aura of a man who was not just visiting, but haunted. He spat a stream of tobacco juice onto the pier, narrowly missing Gash’s polished shoe. “Driving. That’s what folk from the city do. Go places wi’out actually goin’ anywhere.” He squinted out at the churning, grey water. “Sea’s angry today. Got a proper mood on her. Reminds me of your face.”

Gash stood there, buffeted by the wind, feeling the old man’s simple, brutal assessment strip him bare. There were no layers of psychology here, no careful deconstruction of trauma. There was just the sea, the sky, and the hard, unvarnished truth. He found himself speaking, the words coming out unbidden, a confession to a different kind of priest. “Had a bad one. A case. It… got in my head.” Murdo didn’t ask for details. The specifics of land-based misery didn't interest him. He just nodded slowly, his eyes still fixed on the horizon. “The sea does that,” he said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “Gets in your head. I’ve seen it break men. Seen it drive ‘em mad. Seen it take ‘em and never give ‘em back. You think the sea gives a damn about you? About your plans? About your peace and quiet?” He gestured with a scarred thumb at the vast, chaotic expanse of water. “That out there… it’s a beast. It doesn’t care if you live or die. It doesn’t care if you’re a good man or a bastard. It just is.”

He turned his pale eyes back to Gash, and they were as clear and cold as the water itself. “You go out, you cast your net. Sometimes it comes back full. Sometimes it comes back empty. Sometimes it comes back in shreds. And sometimes, you don’t come back at all.” He picked up a shuttle and, with a single, practiced flick of his wrist, tied a complex knot in the green nylon mesh. “You don’t go out there looking for peace, lad. You go out there to do the work. You fight the beast, you take what you can get, and you come home. And if it tears your net, you sit here, on the cold bloody stone, and you mend it. You mend it, and you go out again the next day. Because the fish aren’t coming to you.” The other men grunted in agreement, their heads bent over their own work, mending their own small patch of the vast, torn net. Gash stood in the wind, the old skipper’s words washing over him, a cold, salt spray of common sense. He hadn’t been mending his net. He had been staring at the hole, mesmerised by its shape, obsessed with the storm that had torn it. He had been waiting on the shore for the fish to come to him.

He didn't say goodbye. He just nodded at Murdo, a small, almost imperceptible gesture of acknowledgement, and turned, walking back the way he had come. The wind was at his back now, pushing him towards his car, towards the city, towards the life that was waiting for him. Nothing had been solved. The ghosts were not gone. But they were quieter now, their elegant, philosophical whispers drowned out by the roar of the sea and the simple, brutal wisdom of an old fisherman. The question of what he would do now that his confessor was gone remained. But Murdo had given him a different way to think about it. It wasn't about finding a new church. It was about learning to live in a godless world, to mend your nets, and to go out and do the work. He got in his car and drove south, back towards Inverness. Night was falling, and as he drove, he watched the lights of the city grow brighter, not as a smudge of pollution that blotted out the sublime, but as a simple cluster of homes and streets, a harbour to return to after a long and brutal day at sea.He did not drive home. He drove back to the station, the sterile blue-white lights of the car park a beacon in the deepening gloom. The building was quieter now, the day shift having given way to the skeleton crew of the night. Their faces were fresher, their energy less frayed, and they looked at him with a mixture of awe and morbid curiosity as he passed. He was the man who had walked into the forest and come back with the monster, a figure from a grim fairy tale that was now part of the station’s mythology. He ignored them, making his way to his desk, which sat under the buzzing fluorescent lights like a small, abandoned island. The thin blue folder was where he had left it on Ross’s desk, but someone, probably Fraser, had retrieved it and placed it squarely in the centre of his blotter. It was a statement. A task waiting to be completed. A loose thread.

He sat down, the worn springs of his chair groaning a familiar complaint, and pulled the folder towards him. He opened it, the flimsy pages filled with the banal details of Kevin Ballantyne’s miserable little crime. For a long moment, he just stared at them. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, he turned on his monitor, opened a new document, and began to type. He wrote the arrest report, his large, calloused fingers moving with a heavy, unpractised rhythm on the keyboard. His prose was blunt, stripped of all nuance, a simple recitation of facts. ‘At 16:22 hours, entry was forced at the address of Kevin Ballantyne. The suspect was apprehended while attempting to evade arrest via a rear window. Stolen goods, listed in appendix A, were recovered from the premises. The suspect made a full and frank admission.’ Each sentence was a stone laid in a wall, a small, solid piece of order placed against a tide of chaos. He was not creating art. He was not interpreting a soul. He was just building a case. He was mending a net, one tedious, methodical knot at a time. He wrote until the report was finished, until every box was ticked and every protocol satisfied. When he was done, he printed it, the printer whirring to life in the quiet office like a startled insect. He stapled the pages together with a sharp, violent punch and placed the completed report back in its folder. The work was done.

The next morning, the alarm went off at 4:30 a.m. as it always did. The darkness outside his window was absolute. For a moment, Gash lay motionless, the temptation to simply roll over, to surrender to the grey fog in his mind, was immense. The river was no longer a sanctuary. Going there felt like a deliberate act of self-harm, a pilgrimage to a desecrated shrine. But then he heard Murdo Macrae’s gruff, rasping voice in his head. *You go out again the next day. Because the fish aren’t coming to you.* It was not a call to peace; it was a summons to labour. He swung his legs out of bed, the movement stiff and heavy, and began the routine. He did not think about it. He just did it. He dressed in the dark, pulled on his boots, and walked out into the cold, silent street. He was not seeking solace. He was just a man going to work.

At the rowing club, the air was still and cold, the water a sheet of polished obsidian. He did not pause to appreciate it, to feel its divine presence. He saw it now for what it was: a stretch of cold, deep water, an element to be worked against. He lifted ‘The Morrigan’ from its rack, the carbon fibre shell feeling not like a sacred object but like a tool, no different from a shovel or a hammer. He set it on the water, clipped in the oars, and adjusted the foot stretchers. His movements were functional, stripped of their usual reverence. He was a tradesman preparing his equipment for a day’s toil. He pushed off from the pontoon, the boat sliding out into the pre-dawn darkness, and took his first stroke. It was not a prayer. It was a pull.

It was ugly. The blade went in too deep, the pull was laboured, and the recovery was clumsy. The perfect, silent rhythm was gone, shattered. In its place was noise and effort. He could hear the clunk of the oars in the gate, the loud suck of the water as he released the blade, his own ragged, forceful breathing. The boat felt heavy, unresponsive. The ghosts were there with him, their whispers catching in the windless air. He saw the laughing boy on the canvas, the serene face of the dead sculptor. He heard Croft’s voice, a cool, cultured murmur over the sound of his own grunting effort. *We are not so different, you and I.* Instead of fighting it, instead of trying to drown it out with a frantic, punishing pace, Gash did something new. He listened. He acknowledged the ghosts. He let the whispers come. And he kept rowing. He rowed through them.

He found a new rhythm, born not of grace, but of grit. It was the rhythm of the men mending the nets, the rhythm of a man hauling a lobster pot from the deep, the rhythm of work. It was ugly, noisy, and brutally hard. Each stroke was a conscious, deliberate act of will. Dip. Pull. Release. Feather. The sequence was no longer a mantra; it was a set of instructions, a manual for forward motion. He rowed past the spot on the bank where the call had come, the call that had shattered his world. He looked at it, held its image in his mind for a full, painful second, and then he pulled, driving the boat past it, leaving the memory in his wake, not as a forgotten disturbance, but as a landmark he had now successfully navigated. He rowed until the muscles in his back and legs burned with a familiar, clean fire. He rowed until the rising sun broke over the dark hills, painting the sky in colours he refused to name, refusing to see them as anything other than the simple, physical fact of a new day. He was not at peace. He did not feel clean. But as he turned The Morrigan back towards the club, his body aching and spent, he felt something he had not felt since he had first seen the painting in the boathouse. He felt the solid, simple, undeniable reality of his own tired body, and he knew, with a grim and weary certainty, that he had survived the night.Gash became a machine. In the days that followed his grim epiphany on the water, he processed the petty miseries of Inverness with a relentless, mechanical efficiency. His desk became a churn, taking in raw data—witness statements on vandalism, CCTV footage of shoplifters, forensics reports from pub brawls—and spitting out completed, cross-referenced case files. He was the first in the station and the last to leave, a great, silent engine of police work running in the corner of the office. The dark, brooding energy that had once surrounded him like a storm cloud had collapsed inward, hardening into a diamond-like core of pure, unadulterated focus. He spoke only when necessary, his words clipped and functional, stripped of all extraneous matter. He was no longer a man wrestling with his soul; he was an algorithm executing a series of commands.

His colleagues, who had tiptoed around him during the Croft investigation, were now unsure how to act. Fraser, in particular, watched him with a kind of baffled awe. The Sergeant was back, more effective than ever, yet he was also gone, vanished behind a wall of impenetrable diligence. Fraser would bring him coffee that would go cold, untouched. He would offer theories on minor cases that would be met with a silent, dismissive shake of the head. Gash no longer engaged in the speculative dance of detection; he simply amassed facts until they reached a critical mass and formed a conclusion. He had taken the ugly, simple truth he had found in Kevin Ballantyne’s squalid flat and turned it into a religion. He was no longer hunting for meaning, only for evidence.

It was DCI Ross who finally decided to test the integrity of his new armour. She watched him for a week, observing the furious, almost punitive, pace of his work. He was clearing the board of all the low-level chaff that clogged the system, and while she was pleased with the results, she recognised the manic energy for what it was: a desperate, forward-motion designed to keep the past at bay. She walked over to his desk one grey afternoon and dropped a new file, thicker than the others, onto his blotter. It landed with a soft, authoritative weight. Gash looked up from a report on a stolen catalytic converter, his eyes blank, waiting for his next instruction. “Missing person,” Ross said, her voice crisp and businesslike. “Simon Barrow. Forty-eight. Chief archivist at the Highland Archive Centre. Didn’t show up for work three days ago. Hasn’t been seen or heard from since. Neighbours raised the alarm yesterday. His car is still in the drive. His wallet and keys are on the kitchen counter.”

The house was in a quiet, modern estate on the west side of the city, a neighbourhood of identical, respectable homes with neat lawns and tidy flowerbeds. It was a place designed for people who valued order and predictability. As Gash and Fraser stepped out of their car, the only sound was the distant hum of a lawnmower. A uniformed constable, young and nervous, met them at the door, which was sealed with police tape. “We’ve done a preliminary walkthrough, Sarge,” the constable said. “No signs of forced entry. Nothing seems out of place. It’s just… empty.” Gash nodded, his gaze already moving past the constable, scanning the interior of the house through the open door. He ducked under the tape and stepped inside, Fraser a pace behind him.

The constable was wrong. Nothing was out of place, but that in itself was profoundly wrong. The house wasn’t just tidy; it was sterile, a curated space that felt less like a home and more like a museum exhibit on the theme of meticulous order. In the living room, the cushions on the sofa were perfectly plumped and aligned, their tassels all pointing in the same direction. The spines of the DVDs on the shelves were arranged alphabetically, and then chronologically by release date. In the kitchen, the spice jars in the rack were labelled with a small, precise font, and turned so that every label faced squarely forward. Fraser moved through the rooms with a detective’s eye, looking for overturned furniture, a scuff mark on the floor, a broken glass—the familiar grammar of violence or struggle. Gash moved with a different purpose. He was reading the house itself, absorbing the suffocating, almost fanatical, discipline of the man who had lived there. This was the home of a man who had built a fortress against the chaos of the world, a fortress built of rules and systems.

They found the wallet and keys on the kitchen counter, lying next to a neatly folded newspaper and a single, empty coffee mug sitting perfectly centred on a coaster. His bank cards were all there. A quick check with the bank confirmed his accounts hadn't been touched. He had simply ceased to exist within his own meticulously ordered life. It was in the study, a small room at the back of the house, that Gash finally found the flaw. The room was the heart of Simon Barrow’s obsessive kingdom. Floor-to-ceiling shelves were filled with books, not just arranged, but catalogued according to a precise system that Gash recognised as a modified version of the Library of Congress classification. It was the workspace of a man for whom information was a sacred thing, to be tamed, ordered, and contained. But in the centre of this shrine to systematic perfection, there was a single act of heresy.

One book, a heavy, leather-bound volume, had been pulled from its designated place on a shelf dedicated to local history. It lay open on the large, immaculately clear mahogany desk. Its placement was not careless; it was deliberate, positioned squarely in the centre, a statement piece. Gash approached it slowly, his boots silent on the thick rug. Fraser came to his side, his brow furrowed in confusion. “What is it?” he whispered, as if they were in a church. Gash didn’t answer. His eyes were on the open pages. The book was a detailed history of the Sutherland Clearances. The page it was open to described the brutal eviction of a small, forgotten clachan in the late 18th century, its people scattered to the winds, its homes burned to the ground. A single, faint pencil line, drawn with a ruler, underlined one sentence: *In the space of a single day, their names, their homes, and their history were erased from the land, as if they had never been.*

Fraser shivered, though the room was not cold. “Jesus. Who does that? It’s a message.” Gash continued to stare at the underlined sentence, a strange, cold light beginning to dawn in his eyes. He thought of Cormac Croft’s grand, artistic declarations, his flamboyant acts of possession. This was not that. This was its opposite. This wasn't a celebration of a soul; it was a cold, precise, academic statement of its erasure. Croft had taken his victims and made them immortal on canvas. The person who had taken Simon Barrow had understood his obsession with history, with records, with the preservation of existence, and had left him a single, brutal message, underlined in his own book: You have been deleted. “This isn’t about art, Fraser,” Gash said, his voice a low, resonant hum in the quiet room. “This is about archaeology. Someone didn’t just take a man. They’ve dug him up and thrown away the bones.” He had found his thread. It was not the vibrant, silken thread of a twisted artist, but a cold, thin, colourless strand of methodical, intellectual cruelty. The net needed mending, and the work had just begun.The incident room felt different this time. The frenetic, adrenaline-fueled energy of the Croft investigation, with its lurid portraits and visceral horror, was gone. In its place was a quieter, more cerebral tension. The whiteboard was no longer a canvas for a serial killer’s art show; it was a blank page waiting for a story to be pieced together from missing fragments. At its centre was a passport photo of Simon Barrow, a man with thin, pursed lips, intelligent but unforgiving eyes behind severe rectangular glasses, and an air of prim disapproval. He looked less like a victim and more like a man who had just found a book shelved in the wrong section. Gash stood before the board, a silent, imposing figure, and laid out his theory in the flat, unemotional prose that had become his new language.

“He wasn’t abducted in a crime of passion or opportunity,” Gash began, his voice a low rumble that commanded the room’s attention. “His home wasn’t a crime scene; it was the first part of the message. The perpetrator understood the victim’s psychology. Barrow’s life was a fortress of order. The perpetrator walked in, demonstrated he could move through that fortress at will, and then left a single, deliberate disruption.” He tapped a crime scene photo pinned to the board, showing the open book on the immaculate desk. “The underlined sentence is the motive and the signature. ‘Erased from the land’. This isn’t about killing a man. It’s about deleting him. We’re not looking for a sadist. We’re looking for an editor.”

A few of the younger detectives exchanged skeptical glances. DCI Ross, however, listened intently, her arms crossed, her expression unreadable. She had seen Gash pull a killer out of a ghost’s whisper before; she was not about to dismiss his instincts now, no matter how esoteric they seemed. “An editor?” she repeated, the question sharp. “So we’re looking for a killer with a library card and a grievance?”

“We’re looking for someone as obsessive as the victim,” Gash countered, his gaze unwavering. “Barrow was the Chief Archivist at the Highland Archive Centre. He didn’t just store history; he curated it. He controlled the narrative. His work could legitimize a family’s claim to land or expose a century-old fraud. Somewhere in those dusty records, he found something that threatened someone’s version of the past. And that person decided to protect their history by erasing the historian.” He turned to the team. “I want to know everything Barrow was working on for the last six months. Every document he accessed, every researcher he met with, every argument he had. Forget his personal life. His work was his life. That’s where we’ll find who took it from him.”

The Highland Archive Centre was a modern, imposing building on the banks of the River Ness, a stark cube of glass and pale stone that stood in sharp contrast to the old stone buildings of the city. It was a fortress of a different kind, a climate-controlled vault designed to halt the relentless decay of time. The air inside was cool, dry, and smelled faintly of old paper, leather, and the quiet, sterile hum of preservation. Silence was the dominant feature of the place; footsteps were muffled on cork floors, conversations were conducted in hushed whispers, and the only loud noise was the occasional, startling clang of a fire door. It was the architectural embodiment of Simon Barrow’s mind.

Barrow’s deputy, a woman named Fiona Bain, met them in the hushed reception area. She was in her late fifties, with a nervous, bird-like energy and eyes that were red-rimmed from either lack of sleep or crying. She wrung her hands as she spoke, her voice a strained whisper. “It’s just unthinkable, Sergeant. Simon was… he was the archive. He lived by the timetable, by the catalogue number. For him to just not appear… it’s like a clock deciding not to strike the hour.” She led them through security doors into the main reading room, a vast, sunlit space where a handful of researchers were bent over ancient documents, their concentration absolute.

“Was he a popular man, Ms. Bain?” Fraser asked gently. Fiona Bain let out a short, sharp sound that was almost a laugh before she caught herself. “Popular? Dear me, no. Simon wasn't interested in being popular. He was interested in being correct. He was brilliant, a genius with primary sources. He could spot a forged charter or a misattributed letter from a hundred paces. But he had no patience for lesser minds. He terrified the junior staff. He could be… brutal in his assessments of other people’s work.” Gash listened, a clear picture of the victim forming in his mind. Barrow hadn't just been a keeper of facts; he had been a warrior, using the truth as his weapon. And a man who lives by the sword of absolute fact is bound to make enemies among those who prefer the comfort of a well-maintained legend.

“What was he working on recently?” Gash asked, his voice cutting through the woman’s nervous rambling. “Anything controversial? Anything that made waves?” Fiona’s hands twisted together. “There was one project,” she said, her voice dropping even lower. “It was his own research, not an official archive project. He had become obsessed with the land tenure records for the Strathnaver region, specifically around the time of the Clearances. He believed he had found inconsistencies in the original charters granted to the Sutherland estate.” Her eyes darted around the reading room, as if the ghosts of dukes and factors were listening in the corners. “He told me last week he had found proof. Proof that a significant parcel of land, a clachan that was cleared in the 1820s, was never legally part of the estate. He said the original grant was a forgery, and that the descendants of the cleared families, if they could be traced, would have a legal claim. He was going to publish. He said it was time to ‘correct a historical injustice’.”

Gash felt the cold, thrilling click of a lock tumbling into place. This was it. Not just a dry academic debate, but a discovery with the power to rewrite history, to challenge a foundational story of the Highlands, and, potentially, to have enormous modern-day financial and legal ramifications. “Who knew about this research?” Gash pressed. “Who did he talk to?” “Almost no one,” Fiona said. “He was very secretive. But there was one man, an academic from Edinburgh, Professor Alistair Finch. He specializes in that period. They had a terrible falling out a few months ago. Simon accused him of scholarly negligence in one of his books. It was very public, very bitter. Finch was here last week, demanding to see Simon’s sources. There was a shouting match. In the reading room. It was dreadful.”

Leaving Fraser to get a full statement from Fiona, Gash walked to Barrow’s office. It was a glass-walled box overlooking the reading room, a panopticon from which the archivist could survey his domain. Inside, it was a miniature version of his house: books perfectly aligned, pens arranged in a neat row, not a single stray piece of paper on his desk. The order was absolute, a testament to a man who believed in the power of systems. But Gash, now attuned to the language of absences, scanned the room for the void. He ran his eyes along the shelves, noting the Dewey Decimal precision. And then he saw it. In the section marked ‘DA 880 .S9’—the history of Sutherland—there was a gap. It wasn't a large gap, but in this perfect library, it was as loud as a scream. It was a space for a single, thick folio, the kind used to house unbound manuscripts or maps. He checked the digital log on Barrow’s computer. The last item Barrow had officially accessed from the strong-room was ‘Folio S9-C-1821: Estate Maps and Correspondence, Kildonan Parish’. The folio was not in the office. It had not been returned to the strong-room. And it had not been at his house.

The killer hadn’t just taken Simon Barrow. He had taken his proof. He had understood that killing the man was not enough; to truly erase him, you had to erase his work. He had performed a targeted, intellectual assassination, removing the historian and the history in one clean, precise, and utterly ruthless act. Gash stood in the sterile silence of the office, the ghost of Cormac Croft momentarily forgotten, replaced by a new, colder kind of phantom. This was a killer who didn't paint his victims' souls. He curated their extinction. And he was just as obsessed, just as disciplined, and just as dangerous. Gash now had a motive, a specific historical event, and a missing folio. The game had shifted from the art gallery to the library, but the stakes were just as high.The drive south to Edinburgh was a long, grey ribbon of motorway, a modern artery laid over an ancient, wounded landscape. Gash sat in the passenger seat, silent, watching the rolling hills of the Cairngorms give way to the gentler farmland of Perthshire. He was not admiring the scenery. He was mapping the crime in his head, seeing it not as a single point of violence, but as a sprawling, interconnected territory of motive and opportunity. He was moving from the 'what' to the 'who', a journey that felt infinitely more complex than his last. Fraser, at the wheel, wrestled with the intellectual leap Gash had already made, his brow furrowed in concentration. The raw, visceral horror of the Croft case was something he could understand, but this was a different beast, a creature of shadows and paper cuts.

Professor Alistair Finch’s office was in the oldest part of the university, a gothic quadrangle of black stone and leaded glass that seemed built to intimidate lesser minds. The room itself was a controlled chaos of books, a testament to a life spent in intellectual combat. Towers of them rose from the floor, journals spilled from shelves, and open volumes lay face down on every available surface, their spines broken like vanquished foes. It was the antithesis of Simon Barrow’s sterile, ordered world. Finch himself, a man in his late sixties with a mane of silver hair and a weary, patrician air, matched his surroundings. He wore a rumpled tweed jacket and looked at Gash over the top of his half-moon glasses as if he were a particularly uninteresting footnote that had appeared in the wrong text. He did not seem surprised by their visit, merely inconvenienced.

“Simon Barrow,” Finch sighed, leaning back in his chair, which squeaked in protest. He steepled his fingers, a gesture of academic authority. “A tragic loss, I’m sure. To the archival profession, at least. As a historian, he was a menace.” Gash stood, refusing the offered chair, his large frame an intrusion of blunt, physical reality into this dusty world of ideas. He did not engage in pleasantries. He let the silence hang, a tactic that Finch, a man used to commanding every conversation, found visibly irritating. The professor was the first to break. He waved a dismissive hand. “Oh, I assume you’ve heard about our little tiff. Fiona Bain, I suppose? A born gossip. Yes, I confronted him. I told him his theory about the Kildonan charters was a sensationalist fantasy built on a wilful misreading of 18th-century legalese. I called him a scholarly vandal. I stand by that assessment.”

“You had a shouting match in a public reading room a few days before he vanished,” Gash stated, the words flat, stripped of accusation, yet carrying the weight of a hammer. “Strong words for a disagreement over paperwork.” Finch gave a thin, condescending smile. “Sergeant, in my world, paperwork is the battlefield. Reputations are won and lost on the interpretation of a single clause. Barrow was threatening to detonate a bomb in the middle of a settled historical landscape, purely for the thrill of watching the rubble fly. He didn’t care about the truth; he cared about being the one to tear down the temple. It was my duty to challenge him.” Fraser, taking notes in the corner, scribbled furiously, but Gash remained motionless, his gaze fixed on the professor. He was listening not just to the words, but to the deep, intellectual arrogance behind them, the absolute conviction of a man who believed his version of the world was the only one that mattered.

The drive back to Inverness was shorter, or at least it felt that way. The grey fog in Gash’s mind had been burned away by the cold, clear light of a new and far more formidable problem. He was no longer just searching for a missing man. He was investigating a historical conspiracy that had reached through two centuries to claim a fresh victim. He was tangling with a force that did not operate with the messy passions of individual killers, but with the cold, patient, and utterly ruthless logic of legacy and power. This was an enemy that did not leave paintings and bodies in abandoned boathouses. It left empty offices, missing files, and perfectly constructed legal walls. Fraser, sensing the shift in his superior’s demeanour, drove in silence, glancing occasionally at the Sergeant’s granite profile as he stared out at the darkening road. Gash was no longer adrift. He was on the hunt again, but this time, the beast was not a man, but a dynasty.

Back in the humming quiet of the incident room, Gash walked straight to the whiteboard. He took a black marker and drew a large, ornate box around the name ‘Sutherland Estate’. He then drew a thick, solid line connecting it to Simon Barrow, and another, dotted line to the missing folio. The simple diagram changed the entire tenor of the investigation, shifting it from a search for a person to an assault on a fortress. He turned to the assembled team, his voice low and steady, devoid of the doubt that had plagued him. “Professor Finch is a dead end for now. He’s a peacock with a bruised ego, not a killer. He gave us the real motive. Barrow wasn’t threatening an academic theory; he was threatening an institution. From this point on, we treat the Sutherland Estate not as a piece of history, but as our primary suspect.” The room, which had been buzzing with the mundane work of checking phone records and bank statements, fell silent. They were no longer investigating a simple missing person. They were taking on the ghost of the Highland Clearances, and it was a ghost that had lawyers.

The law firm of Abernethy, Ross & Sinclair occupied the top two floors of the newest, most unapologetically modern glass tower in Inverness. It was a space designed to communicate wealth, influence, and impenetrable confidence. The reception area was a minimalist expanse of Italian marble, brushed steel, and uncomfortable-looking leather chairs, all presided over by a receptionist who looked as though she had been sculpted from ice. The air was cool and silent, the scent of money and expensive air freshener replacing the scent of old paper and dust. Gash, in his slightly crumpled suit, felt like a bull in a china shop, his presence a raw, earthy intrusion into this sterile world of corporate power. He did not have an appointment. He did not wait to be announced. He walked to the desk and stated his purpose in a voice that was quiet but carried the absolute authority of the law.

He was met not by a junior partner or a flustered associate, but by Ms. Eleanor Vance, the firm’s senior partner and the woman whose name was whispered in reverent tones in every boardroom and council chamber in the Highlands. She was in her fifties, impeccably dressed in a dark, severely cut suit, her grey hair styled in a sharp, elegant bob. She received him in her corner office, a room with a panoramic view that looked down on the entire city, including the police station, as if it were a minor detail on a map. She did not rise from her vast, empty glass desk. She simply gestured to a chair with a single, manicured finger, her expression one of polite, professional neutrality. Her eyes, however, were as sharp and cold as chips of granite. “Sergeant Gash,” she said, her voice a smooth, polished instrument. “An unexpected pleasure. How can our firm assist Police Scotland today?”

Gash sat, the chair too small and delicate for his frame. He did not feel intimidated, but he felt the immense, invisible pressure of the power she represented. This was not a woman who could be rattled by a raised voice or a hard stare. Her fortress was made of case law, of trusts and holding companies, of centuries of accumulated influence. He laid it out simply, his words like stones dropped into a deep, still well. “I am investigating the disappearance of Mr. Simon Barrow. His recent research concerned land charters pertaining to your client, the Sutherland Estate. A key historical document, Folio S9-C-1821, is also missing. I have reason to believe his disappearance is connected to this research.”

Eleanor Vance listened without a single flicker of expression. The silence that followed his statement was absolute, a perfect, calculated void. When she finally spoke, her voice was still smooth, still polite, but it now carried the chill of a glacier. “The historical affairs of the Sutherland Estate are a matter of public record, Sergeant, available for any competent researcher to study. Mr. Barrow was one such researcher. We were aware of his… novel theories. As for his disappearance, it is of course a tragedy, and we wish you well in your investigation.” She gave him a small, tight smile that did not come close to reaching her eyes. “However, I must inform you that any and all documents, historical or current, pertaining to the estate’s private affairs are subject to client privilege. Any request to view them, or to speak with any representative of the estate, must be made via a formal, written application, which our legal team will then review for merit. It is a process, as I’m sure you can appreciate, that is designed to protect our client from frivolous or vexatious inquiries.” She leaned back slightly, the interview clearly over. “I trust that clarifies our position.” Gash looked at her, at this woman who was the living embodiment of a two-hundred-year-old wall, and he knew. He was no longer just looking for a killer. He was at war with history itself, and his enemy had just informed him, in the politest possible terms, that it would crush him.
