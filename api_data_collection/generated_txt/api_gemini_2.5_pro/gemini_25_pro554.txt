The phone vibrated against the stainless-steel counter, a frantic, insistent buzz that was definitely not the timer for the espresso shot. Zola ignored it, her focus narrowed to the delicate art of coaxing a fern shape from the steamed milk. A perfect latte was a small, fleeting victory in a day full of them, a tiny island of control in the chaotic sea of her life. The customer, a tourist with a sunburned nose and a camera the size of a small brick, wouldn't appreciate the nuance, but Zola did. It was for her.

The phone buzzed again, skittering an inch closer to a puddle of spilled oat milk. Probably Thandi, impatient as ever. She’d be wanting to know if Zola could get off early for their weekly ritual of cheap wine and complaining about the world. Ja, she probably could. Mr. Henderson was in a good mood today, his usual sour-lemon pucker replaced by a vague, watery smile.

"Nkosi, that phone sounds like an angry bee," he grumbled from the office doorway, not unkindly. "Go answer it in the back before it lays eggs."

Zola wiped her hands on her apron, the fabric stained with the ghosts of a thousand coffees. "Sorry, boss."

She slipped into the cramped storeroom, the air thick with the competing smells of cardboard, bleach, and the sweet, earthy aroma of unroasted coffee beans. She fished the phone from her pocket. Four missed calls from Thandi. Of course. She hit the call-back button, leaning her head against a sack of single-origin Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.

"Zola! Zola, where have you been? I thought you'd fallen into a vat of milk or something!" Thandi's voice was a high-pitched shriek, distorted by the cheap speaker.

"I was making a fern, T. A really good one. What's the emergency? Did your landlord finally discover the illegal cat?"

"Forget the cat! Forget everything! Did you check your email? Oh my god, Zola, just check your email!"

A familiar knot of dread tightened in Zola's stomach. It was probably a rejection. Another one. After the high of the semi-finals, the crushing silence of the last two weeks had been a special kind of torture. She’d auditioned for 'Starlight Search' on a whim, a dare from Thandi after one too many glasses of Sauvignon Blanc. She’d never expected to get past the first round, let alone the televised heats. And the semi-final... she had poured every ounce of herself into that performance, her fingers raw on the strings of her guitar, her voice cracking with the emotion she usually kept locked down tight. She’d walked off that stage feeling hollowed out, exposed, but also, for the first time in years, truly alive. The judges had been poker-faced. The silence since had been deafening.

"I'm at work, T. The Wi-Fi in here is useless."

"Go outside! Steal a customer's hotspot! Bribe a rich German tourist! I don't care, just do it now!"

The sheer, unadulterated joy in Thandi's voice was impossible to ignore. It chipped away at Zola's carefully constructed wall of cynicism. Hope, that treacherous little bastard, began to unfurl in her chest. "Okay, okay, calm down. I'll check when I get a signal."

"No! Now!"

Zola sighed, a long-suffering sound she’d perfected over years of friendship with Thandi. "Fine." She walked back into the café, holding her phone aloft like a divining rod. A few customers glanced up. She ignored them, her eyes fixed on the single bar of service that flickered to life near the front window, right next to the display of stale croissants. She tapped the mail icon. The app churned, the little wheel spinning and spinning. Zola held her breath.

And then it loaded. An email, the subject line stark and terrifyingly official: "Starlight Search: Finalist Notification."

Her thumb hovered over it, suddenly clumsy and slick with sweat. Her heart was a frantic drum against her ribs, loud enough to drown out the clatter of the café. This was it. The moment that split her life into a 'before' and an 'after'. She pressed down.

The text was a blur at first. Corporate jargon, pleasantries. Her eyes snagged on the words. "…pleased to inform you…" and then, a little further down, "...congratulations on securing a place in the Grand Final of Starlight Search."

The world tilted. The sounds of the café—the hiss of the steam wand, the clink of ceramic, a baby crying—faded into a dull, distant roar. All she could hear was the blood rushing in her ears. She read the line again. And again. The words didn't change. They were real. Solid. She, Zola Nkosi, barista, dreamer, singer of sad songs in her cramped little flat in Observatory, was a finalist. She was going to the final. A shot. A real, honest-to-god shot.

A hand touched her arm, and she jumped, a strangled gasp escaping her lips. It was the sunburned tourist. "Excuse me," he said, his accent thick and vaguely American. "Is the almond croissant fresh?"

Zola stared at him, her mind a complete blank. Fresh? Was anything fresh? She felt like she’d been remade, every cell in her body zinging with a terrifying, brilliant new energy.

"Ja," she managed, her voice a croak. "Lekker fresh."

She stumbled back towards the storeroom, the phone clutched in her hand like a holy relic. She almost ran into Mr. Henderson.

"Everything alright, Nkosi?" he asked, peering at her over his spectacles.

Zola looked at him, a wide, unthinking grin spreading across her face. It felt foreign, like she was stretching muscles she hadn't used in years. "Everything," she said, her voice giddy, "is bloody fantastic."

The sun was beginning its slow descent towards the Atlantic, painting the sky in strokes of apricot and lavender as Zola stepped out onto Long Street. The air, usually thick with the exhaust of minibus taxis and the faint smell of fried food, felt different tonight. It tasted of possibility. Table Mountain stood silhouetted against the deepening colours, its flat top a familiar, reassuring presence. For her whole life, it had been a backdrop. Tonight, it felt like a witness.

She met Thandi at their usual spot, a tiny, slightly grimy bar called 'The Perch' that had a balcony overlooking the controlled chaos of the city. Thandi was already there, a bottle of the cheapest sparkling wine the bar sold sweating in an ice bucket on the table. She launched herself at Zola the moment she saw her, wrapping her in a hug so tight it threatened to crack a rib.

"You did it! You actually, properly did it!" Thandi yelled, her voice muffled in Zola's shoulder.

"We did it," Zola corrected, her voice thick with emotion as she hugged her back. Thandi had been the one to film her first clumsy audition video, to coach her through her stage fright, to listen to the same three chords over and over again as Zola wrestled a new song into existence.

They sat down, and Thandi poured the sparkling wine into two smudged glasses with the flourish of a sommelier. "To Zola Nkosi," she declared, raising her glass. "The next voice of South Africa. And to getting the hell out of that coffee shop."

Zola laughed, a real, full-throated laugh that felt like shaking dust from an old blanket. They clinked glasses, the sound sharp and bright. The wine was terrible, overly sweet and acidic, but it was the most delicious thing Zola had ever tasted.

"I can't believe it, T," Zola said, shaking her head as she stared out at the city lights beginning to flicker on. "Me. In the final. It doesn't feel real."

"Of course it's real! I told you, didn't I? From that very first open mic night at the Armchair Theatre, when you were so nervous you nearly threw up on your guitar. I told you that voice was something else."

Zola winced at the memory. She’d been eighteen, armed with her beat-up acoustic guitar—a second-hand Yamaha she’d named Nomvula, ‘she who brings the rain’—and a song about a broken heart she hadn’t even experienced yet. The crowd had been sparse, mostly other nervous musicians and a few bored regulars. But when she’d started to sing, a hush had fallen over the room. Her voice, a low, smoky alto that could climb into a heart-wrenching cry without warning, had a power that always surprised people. It surprised her, too. It felt like something that came through her, not from her.

"They must have made a mistake," Zola murmured, tracing the condensation on her glass. The old habit of self-sabotage died hard.

"Don't you dare," Thandi said, her expression turning serious. She reached across the table and grabbed Zola's hand. "Don't you start that. You earned this. You sang 'Siyaya' in the semi-final. You took a struggle song, stripped it back to just you and Nomvula, and made those rich, white judges feel something. I saw their faces. Even that miserable bastard Gavin was tapping his pen. You deserve this, Zola. You hear me?"

Zola squeezed her friend's hand, a wave of gratitude washing over her. "I hear you." She took a deep breath, letting the belief in Thandi's eyes seep into her. "The prize money... It would change everything. I could finally get a proper recording setup. Quit the café. Maybe even put a down payment on a small flat, one without mould in the bathroom."

"And you'll get to perform for Kai," Thandi added, her eyes wide with excitement.

Kai. The thought sent another jolt, a mixture of pure terror and ecstatic reverence, through Zola. Kai was the guest judge for the final. Not just a South African celebrity, but a global icon. A musical genius whose lyrics had been the soundtrack to Zola's entire adolescence. The idea of standing on a stage, with him watching, listening… it was too much to comprehend.

"He's a god, T. What am I going to do? Just stand there and weep?"

"You're going to sing," Thandi said simply. "And he's going to see what I've seen for years."

They sat for hours, drinking the cheap wine and dreaming big, audacious dreams under the vast African sky. They planned her final performance, what she would wear, the song she would sing. It had to be an original. Something raw and honest. Something that was purely Zola. For the first time, the future didn't feel like a locked door, but an open road stretching out before her.

Later, Zola walked home through the quiet, student-filled streets of Observatory. The familiar neighbourhood, with its quirky houses and graffiti-covered walls, felt charged with magic. Her flat was on the top floor of a slightly crumbling Victorian house, two small rooms that were more filled with books and musical equipment than actual furniture. Nomvula was leaning against the wall where she’d left her that morning, her wooden body seeming to gleam in the dim light from the streetlamp outside.

Zola picked her up, the familiar weight of the guitar a comfort in her arms. Her fingers found the fretboard, muscle memory taking over. She didn't think. She just played. A melody began to form, hesitant at first, then stronger, a string of notes full of the evening's fragile, soaring hope. It was a song about open roads and new beginnings.

Her phone buzzed on the small table beside her. A message from Thandi.

*They put the finalist page up on the website! You look amazing! Check it out!*

A link followed. Zola set her guitar down gently and clicked. The page loaded, a slick, corporate splash of the 'Starlight Search' logo. And there she was. Zola Nkosi. Her photo was from the semi-final, caught in a moment of intense concentration, her brow furrowed, her lips parted as she sang. She didn't hate it. She looked like a real musician. A goofy, proud smile touched her lips.

She scrolled down, eager to see who she was up against. The other finalists. A fresh-faced boy band from Durban. A powerhouse gospel singer from Soweto. A young classical pianist. All talented, she was sure. She could hold her own. Her smile widened.

And then she saw it. The last photo. The final name on the list.

Bianca 'Bia' du Plessis.

The air punched out of Zola's lungs. The hopeful melody that had been singing in her head just moments before shattered into silence. It couldn't be. Not her. Anyone but her.

The photo was professionally taken, probably from Bia's own portfolio. She was staring directly into the camera, a smirk playing on her perfectly glossed lips. Her blonde hair was styled into effortless beachy waves, her blue eyes held a cold, competitive glint. She looked polished, expensive, and utterly confident. She looked like a winner.

Zola's stomach churned, the cheap sparkling wine turning to acid in her gut. Bianca. The ghost at every gig, the shadow that had haunted her steps through the Cape Town music scene for the last three years. They had started at the same time, playing the same circuit of dingy bars and open mic nights. But where Zola was raw, Bianca was refined. Where Zola bled on the stage, Bianca sparkled. She played a brand of generic, radio-friendly pop that Zola despised, but audiences loved it. Promoters loved it. Bianca got the better time slots, the bigger crowds, the paid gigs, while Zola was often left playing to the bar staff at the end of the night.

Their rivalry had crystallised one night at a battle of the bands. Zola had played a new song, one she was intensely proud of, a complex, heart-wrenching piece about her mother. The next week, Bianca had performed a new song of her own—one with a suspiciously similar chord progression and a watered-down, sentimental theme that had the crowd eating out of her hand. Zola had confronted her afterwards, her voice shaking with rage. Bianca had just laughed, a tinkling, dismissive sound. "Inspiration is everywhere, darling," she’d said, flicking her perfect hair. "You should be flattered."

Zola had never forgiven her. She had actively avoided any event Bianca was playing at ever since. Now, there was no avoiding her. They were on a collision course, on the biggest stage of Zola’s life. All the joy, all the effervescent hope of the evening, deflated, leaving behind a cold, heavy dread. Starlight Search wasn’t just a talent show anymore. It was a battlefield. And her arch-nemesis had just marched onto it, armed and ready. Zola stared at the screen, at Bianca's smug, smiling face, and the city lights outside her window seemed to mock her, each one a tiny, glittering reminder of a dream that was suddenly in danger of being stolen. Again.Her phone buzzed again, a different, softer vibration this time. A text message. It was Thandi again, her words a stark, painful contrast to the cold reality sinking into Zola’s bones.

*Did you see the others? That boy band looks like they escaped from a 2002 catalogue. You’ve got this in the bag!!!*

The message, meant to be encouraging, felt like a slap. Thandi didn’t know. She hadn’t scrolled to the bottom of the page. Zola’s fingers fumbled as she dialled Thandi’s number, her earlier giddiness curdling into a nauseous unease. The phone picked up on the first ring.

"I knew you'd be freaking out in a good way! Are you composing your victory speech yet? I think you should thank me first, obviously, then your Gogo, then maybe Mr. Henderson for being a surprisingly decent grump—"

"She's in it, Thandi," Zola cut in, her voice flat and lifeless. The two small rooms of her flat suddenly felt claustrophobic, the walls closing in.

There was a pause on the other end of the line. The excited babble ceased, replaced by a tense silence. "She? Who’s she? What are you talking about?"

"Bianca," Zola whispered the name, and it felt like poison on her tongue. "Bianca du Plessis. She's the fifth finalist."

Another beat of silence, longer this time. When Thandi finally spoke, her voice had lost all its earlier champagne-fueled levity. It was cold and hard as steel. "That… that *bitch*. Are you serious? How? With what? Another song she stole from someone more talented?"

The raw, unfiltered rage in her friend's voice was a strange comfort, a confirmation that Zola wasn't overreacting. The injustice of it was real, a shared wound. "I don't know. I just saw her picture. She's there, T. Looking like she owns the whole damn competition already."

"No. No, we are not doing this," Thandi's voice snapped with authority, pulling Zola back from the edge of the spiralling panic. "We are not letting that blonde-haired demon steal your joy tonight. You got into the final. You! Not because your daddy bought you a fancy guitar and a PR team, but because you stood on that stage and you ripped your heart out for everyone to see. Do you remember what Kai's last album was called? *Authenticity*. That's what he looks for. That's you, Zola. It's not her."

Zola sank onto the edge of her bed, the mattress springs groaning in protest. Nomvula was still leaning against the wall, but now the guitar seemed to mock her, a reminder of the song that Bianca had plundered. The memory, which she had pushed down for years, came rushing back with brutal clarity. It was at 'The Cauldron', a grimy venue that smelled perpetually of stale beer and desperation. The prize for the battle of the bands was a thousand rand and a Saturday night headline slot. To Zola, it had felt like the world. She had decided to play 'Mama's Hands', a song she’d written late one night after a phone call with her grandmother, a quiet, aching tribute to the mother she’d lost as a child. It was intensely personal, built around a strange, syncopated fingerpicking pattern she had struggled with for weeks. It was a song made of her own grief.

The performance had been terrifying. The room had been noisy, but as she sang, a silence fell. She finished, her fingers trembling, her eyes blurred with tears she refused to let fall. She hadn’t won—the prize went to a loud, generic rock band—but people had come up to her afterwards, their eyes soft, telling her how much the song had moved them. For a moment, it had been enough. A week later, she'd gone to support a friend at another open mic. Bianca was on the bill. She’d sauntered onto the stage, all shimmering confidence, and announced a new, "deeply personal" song. The first notes she played were a simplified, pop-friendly version of Zola's unique chord progression. The lyrics were a saccharine, greeting-card version of Zola's raw grief, talking about "angel wings" and "watching from above." The crowd had lapped it up.

The confrontation afterwards was seared into Zola’s memory. The sight of Bianca filing her nails backstage, not even bothering to look up as Zola, shaking with a righteous fury, accused her of theft. Bianca's cold, dismissive laugh. "Oh, sweetheart, don't be so dramatic. It's just a few chords. No one owns chords. Consider it a tribute." The word 'sweetheart' had been laced with such condescending poison that Zola had felt physically sick. That night, she had gone home and smashed a cheap ceramic mug against her wall, the jagged pieces a perfect mirror of how she felt inside.

"Zola? Are you still there?" Thandi's voice broke through the memory.

"I'm here," Zola said, her voice stronger now, the old anger a familiar, fortifying fire in her belly. "You're right. You're right."

"Damn right, I'm right. This isn't a setback. This is a story. The underdog, the authentic artist, against the manufactured pop princess. The judges will see it. The audience will see it. Kai will see it. But you have to believe it first. This is not the end of your dream, Zola. This is the goddamn final boss battle."

A small, humourless laugh escaped Zola's lips. A final boss battle. It was a ridiculous, perfect Thandi-ism. And yet, it shifted something inside her. The dread didn't vanish, but it receded, making way for something else: resolve. Bianca had taken something from her once. She would not let it happen again. Not on this stage. Not with this much at stake.

"Okay," Zola said, standing up. She walked over to her guitar and picked it up. The wood felt warm and solid in her hands. "Okay. A boss battle."

"That's my girl," Thandi's voice was full of warmth and pride. "Now, get off the phone. Stop looking at her stupid, smug face online. Go write the song that's going to bury her."

They said their goodbyes, and Zola placed the phone on her bed. The silence of the flat returned, but it was a different kind of silence now. It wasn't empty; it was waiting. She looked at her reflection in the dark window pane. The wide, giddy grin from the coffee shop was gone, replaced by a look of fierce determination she barely recognised. Thandi was right. This was a story. And Zola was not going to be the tragic supporting character in Bianca’s victory lap.

Her fingers found the strings of Nomvula. She didn't try to find the hopeful melody from before. That song was gone, a relic of an evening that had lasted only a few precious hours. Instead, her fingers moved with a new purpose, searching for different chords. Minor keys. Chords with tension and grit. She thought of the sour taste of cheap sparkling wine, the weight of Table Mountain watching her, the sting of Bianca's laughter, and the unshakeable loyalty in Thandi's voice. All of it—the hope, the rage, the fear, the fight—began to twist together into a new sound. It wasn't a sad song. It wasn't a happy song. It was a song of defiance. A song that declared, *I am still here*. The first line came to her, quiet but clear in the lamplit room. It was a promise to herself, and a warning to her rival.## Chapter 2

The world of ‘Starlight Search’ was housed in a cavernous, repurposed warehouse in the industrial district of Paarden Eiland, a part of Cape Town that smelled of salt and industry and was a world away from the bohemian scruff of Observatory. The moment Zola stepped through the double doors, she felt like she’d been transported to another planet. The air buzzed with a low, electric hum, a symphony of hurried footsteps on polished concrete, hushed conversations spoken into headsets, and the distant, muffled thud of a bass beat from a rehearsal room. Everything was either gleaming chrome or matte black, bathed in the sharp, unforgiving glare of professional lighting rigs. People with lanyards and clipboards bustled past, their faces masks of intense, focused energy. It was a factory for dreams, and Zola immediately felt like an uninspected, faulty part.

She clutched the strap of her guitar case, Nomvula’s familiar weight on her back the only grounding force in this alien landscape. Thandi had insisted on helping her pick an outfit, a process that had involved Zola trying on half her wardrobe while Thandi vetoed everything as "too sad," "too much like a librarian," or "is that a coffee stain or a statement?" They’d eventually settled on her best black jeans, a dark grey t-shirt, and her worn leather boots. In her own world, she felt comfortable. Here, she felt drab and underdressed, a sparrow that had wandered into a flock of peacocks.

A young woman with a violently pink haircut and a tablet gestured her towards a door marked ‘Finalist Green Room’. The room itself was a paradox of forced luxury. A plush white sofa sat opposite a wall of exposed brick, a state-of-the-art coffee machine hummed next to a vintage arcade game, and a large flat-screen TV displayed a rotating loop of the finalists' headshots. Zola’s face appeared between a gospel singer and a pianist, her expression of fierce concentration looking almost angry next to their polished smiles. She saw them now, in the flesh. The gospel singer, a woman in her forties with a warm, commanding presence named Esther Mhlambi, was chatting quietly with the classical pianist, a teenager named Leo who looked like he might be swallowed whole by his oversized hoodie. The boy band, four grinning lads from Durban who all seemed to share the same haircut and dazzlingly white teeth, were clustered around the arcade machine, their laughter echoing a little too loudly in the tense space. They called themselves ‘Coastal Vibe’. Zola cringed.

She found a corner of the sofa that seemed the least intimidating and sat down, placing her guitar case carefully by her feet. Leo the pianist gave her a shy, fleeting smile, which she returned with a small nod. Esther’s gaze met hers for a moment, her eyes kind and appraising, before she was pulled into a conversation with a frantic-looking production assistant. Zola felt a familiar urge to make herself invisible, to retreat into the shell she had perfected over years of being an observer. She was just starting to sink into the cushions when the door swung open again, and the atmosphere in the room shifted, the air crackling with a new, sharp energy.

Bianca du Plessis had arrived. She didn't just walk in; she made an entrance, a vision in a white designer jumpsuit, her blonde hair catching the light as she surveyed the room. She was trailed by a man in a tight-fitting suit who was speaking into his phone, presumably her manager. Bianca’s eyes swept over the boy band, Esther, and Leo, giving each a quick, dismissive appraisal. Then, her gaze landed on Zola. A slow, predatory smile spread across her face.

"Zola, darling," she cooed, gliding across the room, the scent of expensive perfume preceding her like a herald. "I was so thrilled when I saw your name on the list. It's been ages." She stopped in front of Zola, forcing her to look up. "Still playing all those… moody little songs on that old thing?" She gestured vaguely towards Nomvula’s case with a perfectly manicured hand.

The old anger, hot and sharp, flared in Zola’s chest. The condescending "darling," the casual dismissal of her music, the jab at her beloved guitar—it was a masterclass in passive aggression. The boy band had fallen silent, watching the exchange with undisguised interest. Zola could feel the heat rising in her cheeks, but she met Bianca’s cold blue eyes. "Still writing them, Bia," she said, her voice quiet but firm. "Someone has to."

Bianca’s smile tightened for a fraction of a second, a tiny crack in the flawless facade. Before she could respond, the door opened again and the producer, a slick, energetic man named Marcus with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes, clapped his hands together. "Alright, stars! Welcome to the final week! Let's gather 'round, people, time is money and we have a lot of it to spend on making you fabulous!"

For the next hour, Marcus outlined a schedule so packed it made Zola’s head spin. Wardrobe fittings, media training sessions, pre-recorded interviews, choreography for the opening number, and one-on-one sessions with the show's vocal coach. It was a relentless, highly structured machine designed to polish them into marketable products. Zola felt a wave of nausea. This had nothing to do with music; it was about manufacturing celebrity. Bianca, however, was in her element. She asked intelligent, strategic questions about social media integration and brand synergy, using corporate buzzwords that made Zola feel like she was in a foreign country without a phrasebook.

Their first stop was a one-on-one with the vocal coach, a woman named Annelise who had a reputation for being a miracle worker and a tyrant in equal measure. Zola found herself in a small, soundproofed room with a grand piano and Annelise, whose severe black bob and piercing stare were more intimidating than any audience she'd ever faced. "So," Annelise said, her tone brisk. "Zola Nkosi. The raw talent. The diamond in the rough. That's the narrative, yes? Let's see if there's any diamond under all that rough. What are you singing for the final?"

The question hung in the air. Zola’s song was still a fragile skeleton. It had a chorus, a few verses, but it was still raw, unformed, a thing of late-night scribbles and quiet, hesitant chords. She hadn't even played it for Thandi yet. "It's a new song," Zola managed. "An original. It's not… it's not finished."

Annelise raised a skeptical eyebrow. "Not finished? The final is in six days. That's either very brave or very stupid. Play what you have."

Her hands trembling slightly, Zola took Nomvula out of her case. The room was unnervingly quiet. She took a breath and began to play. The chords were dissonant, full of the tension and anger she’d felt in her flat that night. She sang the first lines, her voice low and husky. *"You can steal the chords but you can't steal the blues / You can wear my crown but you can't walk in my shoes…"* It was a direct shot, a declaration of war set to music. She sang with her eyes closed, pouring the frustration and defiance of the last few days into the melody. When she finished the first verse and chorus, she let the final chord hang in the air, her heart pounding.

She opened her eyes. Annelise was staring at her, her expression unreadable. "Well," the coach said finally, tapping a long finger against her chin. "The anger is potent. It's real. But it's undisciplined. Your voice is cracking on the high notes, you're sacrificing technique for emotion. Passion is useless if the audience can't understand what you're saying, Zola. We need to sand down the edges. Make it powerful, not just loud." For the next thirty minutes, Annelise deconstructed the song, forcing Zola to sing scales, to focus on her breathing, to control the very emotion that was the song's lifeblood. Zola felt exposed, stripped bare, her creation vivisected on a sterile operating table.

As she left the coaching room, feeling raw and disheartened, she heard the sound of a perfectly produced pop track booming from the room next door. It was Bianca's session. The song was an upbeat, radio-ready anthem about overcoming adversity, complete with a soaring chorus and a catchy, electronic beat. It was technically flawless, emotionally hollow, and utterly, undeniably, a hit. Zola’s heart sank. How could her gritty, angry little song compete with that? The doubt that Bianca had planted began to sprout, its roots wrapping around her confidence. Thandi's words about authenticity felt naive in this high-stakes, commercial environment. Here, it seemed sparkle was worth more than substance.

That evening, the show put the finalists up in a sterile business hotel near the waterfront. Zola’s room was spacious and anonymous, with a king-sized bed and a window overlooking the brightly lit harbour. It felt less like a home than a holding cell. She flopped onto the bed, the events of the day replaying in her mind: the intimidating studio, Marcus’s slick pronouncements, Annelise’s sharp critique, and above all, Bianca’s confident smirk and perfectly constructed song. She felt small and out of her depth, a fraud who had somehow wandered onto the biggest stage of her life.

She was just about to call Thandi for an emergency pep talk when there was a soft knock on her door. Confused, she opened it to find Esther Mhlambi, the gospel singer, standing in the hallway. She held two cups of tea, steam curling gently from their rims.

"I saw your face when you came out of Annelise's room," Esther said, her voice a low, soothing melody. "She has a way of making you feel like a naughty schoolchild, that one. I thought you might need this." She handed Zola a cup. It was rooibos, sweet and earthy.

"Thank you," Zola said, surprised by the gesture.

Esther leaned against the doorframe, her presence warm and comforting in the cold, impersonal hallway. "Don't let them change your sound, child," she said, her eyes soft but serious. "I heard a little of your song through the door before Bianca started her racket. There is truth in that voice. Don't let them polish it away. That shiny girl," she nodded in the general direction of Bianca's room down the hall, "her song is like a firework. Bright and loud, and then gone. Yours… yours is like a coal. It burns slow, but it burns hot and it keeps you warm for a long time. Don't you forget that."

Zola stared at her, speechless. The simple, profound kindness from this near-stranger was a balm on her frayed nerves. It was the first time all day that she felt seen, not as a product to be packaged, but as an artist. "Thank you," she said again, her voice thick with an emotion she couldn't name.

Esther just smiled, a wide, genuine smile that lit up her whole face. "We coals have to stick together," she said with a wink. She patted Zola's arm gently and then turned, heading back to her own room. Zola closed the door, the warmth of the teacup seeping into her cold hands. She looked over at Nomvula, leaning against the wall. Esther’s words echoed in her head. *It burns slow, but it burns hot.* The doubt hadn't vanished, but for the first time that day, a flicker of her own fire, the defiant flame from the night before, began to burn again.## Chapter 3

The days leading up to the final were a blur of calculated artifice. Zola felt like she was being pushed through a high-gloss production line, each station designed to buff out her imperfections. During media training, she fumbled her answers, her genuine thoughts getting tangled in the prescribed "key messaging," while Bianca delivered flawless soundbites with the practiced ease of a seasoned politician. In choreography, Zola moved with a self-conscious stiffness, always half a beat behind, while Bianca and the Coastal Vibe boys mastered the simple, synchronized movements with an alarming enthusiasm. It was a world of surfaces, and Zola, who lived in the depths, felt like she was drowning.

The one-on-one mentorship sessions with Kai were scheduled for Thursday, two days before the finale. A wave of nervous excitement rippled through the finalists. This was the real prize, Zola thought, more than the money or the record deal. An hour with a living legend. An hour with the man whose music had taught her that a song could be a prayer, a protest, and a confession all at once.

The sessions were held in a smaller, more intimate studio down the hall, a room filled with vintage keyboards and guitars hanging on the walls like sacred relics. They were called in one by one. Leo, the pianist, went in looking terrified and came out an hour later looking dazed and inspired, clutching a piece of paper on which Kai had apparently scribbled some chord changes. Bianca was next. She sauntered in, giving Zola a triumphant smirk over her shoulder as the door closed. Zola sat in the waiting area, her hands sweating, her stomach a tight knot of anticipation and dread. She tried to practice the breathing exercises Annelise had drilled into her, but her heart refused to listen, hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird.

When Bianca emerged, her face was glowing. "He's an absolute dream," she announced to the room at large, though her eyes were fixed on Zola. "He completely got what I was doing with my song. We talked about a potential collaboration. He thinks the track has huge international crossover potential." The lie was so blatant, so perfectly crafted to demoralize, that Zola almost had to admire the sheer audacity. But it worked. A stone of despair dropped into her gut. If Kai loved Bianca's plastic pop, what would he think of her own raw, unfinished snarl of a song?

"Zola Nkosi," the pink-haired assistant said, peeking her head out the door. "You're up."

Taking a deep breath that did nothing to calm her, Zola grabbed Nomvula and walked into the room. The air inside was still and quiet. And there he was. Kai was not sitting behind a large desk or on a producer’s throne. He was perched on a simple wooden stool, nursing a mug of tea, looking smaller and more thoughtful in person than his iconic stage presence suggested. He wore a simple black t-shirt and jeans, his famous dreadlocks tied back from a face that was etched with lines of thought and laughter. He didn't look like a god. He looked like a musician.

"Zola," he said, and his voice was exactly as she’d imagined: a low, gravelly baritone that seemed to vibrate with a deep warmth. He gestured to another stool opposite him. "Have a seat. I've been looking forward to this. That performance of 'Siyaya' in the semis… it was brave. You made an old song sound new again."

The praise, so simple and direct, short-circuited Zola's brain. All the clever things she had imagined saying, all her prepared questions, evaporated. "Thank you," she mumbled, feeling like a star-struck teenager.

"Marcus tells me you're singing an original for the final," Kai continued, his gaze steady and unnervingly perceptive. "But that it's giving the coaches some trouble. Show me what you've got."

Her fingers felt like clumsy sausages as she positioned her guitar. This was it. She closed her eyes for a second, picturing Esther’s kind face. *It burns slow, but it burns hot.* She took a breath and played. She sang the song as it was, a vessel for her anger and frustration. She sang the lines about stolen chords and imitation crowns, her voice rising with a raw, almost ragged power. She channeled the sting of Bianca's laughter, the condescension in her voice, the injustice of it all. When she finished, the last chord snarling into silence, she kept her head down, afraid to see the disappointment on his face.

The silence stretched on, thick and heavy. Finally, Kai spoke. "The fire is there," he said, his voice soft. "I can feel the heat from here. But anger is a mask, Zola. It’s the easiest, loudest emotion. It’s the armour we wear to protect the softer thing underneath. What's under the anger?"

Zola looked up, confused. "It's about… someone stealing my music."

"Is it?" Kai took a sip of his tea, his eyes never leaving her face. "I've had songs stolen. I've had my style copied. It's infuriating. But the anger fades. What you've written here… this feels deeper than that. This isn't just about a stolen song. This is about being silenced. Am I wrong?"

The question hit her like a physical blow. The air punched out of her lungs. Silenced. The word hung in the room, unlocking a door inside her she had kept bolted for years. She thought of all the times she’d been told she was too much, or not enough. Too moody, too intense, too quiet. She thought of promoters picking Bianca's shiny pop over her difficult truths. She thought of her own self-doubt, the inner voice that whispered that her stories weren't worth telling. It wasn't just about Bianca. It was about the fear that her voice, her real voice, would never be truly heard.

Tears pricked her eyes, hot and unwelcome. "I…" she started, her voice breaking. She looked away, mortified.

"Hey," Kai said gently. "That. That's the song. Not the rage at the thief. The pain of the person who was robbed. The fear that they'll be left with nothing. Don't hide that part, Zola. That's the part the world needs to hear. That's the part that's universal. Go back to that feeling. Write from there. The fire is good, but you need to show them what's fueling it." He leaned forward, and his expression was one of profound empathy. "Your voice is a rare thing. Don't use it just to tell us you're angry. Use it to tell us why you have to sing in the first place."

Zola left the studio in a daze, Kai’s words echoing in her mind. *What's under the anger?* She bypassed the Green Room, ignoring the curious stares from the other contestants. She didn't go back to her sterile hotel room. Instead, she walked out of the studio complex and headed towards the ocean, a few blocks away. The wind was picking up, whipping off the cold Atlantic, carrying the smell of salt and kelp. She found a concrete breakwater and sat, Nomvula's case beside her, staring out at the grey, churning water.

Kai had seen her. In twenty minutes, he had seen her more clearly than she had seen herself in years. He hadn't given her a solution; he had given her a map back to her own heart. The anger at Bianca hadn't disappeared, but it was no longer the main character in her story. It was just a symptom of a deeper ache: the terror of being invisible.

She pulled Nomvula from her case, her fingers numb from the cold wind. She ignored the stares of a few people walking their dogs along the promenade. She started to play, not the angry chords from before, but something quieter, more inquisitive. She thought about her Gogo, her grandmother, who had raised her. She thought about her mother’s hands, a memory so faint it was more of a feeling. She thought about Thandi’s unwavering belief, a lighthouse in her own sea of doubt. These were the things that fueled her. These were the reasons she had to sing.

The lyrics began to change. The accusatory "you" shifted to a defiant "I". It was no longer a song about what had been taken from her, but about what could never be stolen. Her history, her voice, her truth. The chorus transformed. The melody softened in the verses, allowing her voice to show its vulnerability, the cracks not as mistakes but as channels for honest emotion. Then, it swelled in the chorus, not with ragged anger, but with a powerful, soaring declaration of self. It was a song about claiming her own space, her own sound, in a world that wanted to package her or silence her.

She played for over an hour, the wind and the waves her only audience, until the song felt whole. It felt true. It had sanded its own edges, not by force, but by finding its core. It was still a coal, but now, its heat was tempered with light.

Later that night, back in the quiet of her hotel room, she called Thandi. She didn't recount the horrors of media training or Bianca's psychological warfare. She just told her about Kai.

"He told me to find what was under the anger," Zola said, her voice soft.

"And what did you find?" Thandi asked, her tone gentle.

"Me, I think," Zola replied. "I found me." She propped the phone on her pillow. "Do you want to hear it?"

"More than anything," Thandi whispered.

Zola took a breath, and in the stillness of the anonymous room, she began to sing. Her voice was clear and steady, her fingers sure on the frets. She sang of struggle and survival, of borrowed chords and the un-borrowable soul, of finding light in the quietest corners of her own heart. It was a song that had been forged in fire, cooled by the ocean, and was now, finally, ready for the stage. It was a song called 'My Own Shoes'. And as the final, resonant chord faded into the silence, Zola knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that she was ready to walk in them.The day of the final broke over Cape Town in a blaze of unapologetic glory. From her hotel window, Zola watched the sun catch the glass towers of the city centre, turning them into pillars of light. The frantic energy of the week had settled into a strange, profound calm inside her. The fear hadn't vanished completely; it had simply changed shape, transforming from a crippling monster into a low, thrumming hum of adrenaline. She wasn't afraid of failing anymore. She was afraid of not giving the song, her truth, the performance it deserved. She had something to say now, and the stage was no longer a place of judgment, but simply a place to be heard.

At the studio, the atmosphere was thick with hairspray and nervous tension. Production assistants ran in frantic circles, their headsets crackling with last-minute crises. The Coastal Vibe boys were huddled in a corner, practicing harmonies with a desperate intensity. Zola found Esther by the coffee machine, a serene island in the middle of the storm. The older woman took one look at Zola's face and smiled. "There you are," she said, as if Zola had finally arrived at a destination she'd been travelling towards all week. "The fire is burning clean today, child." Zola smiled back, a real, unforced smile. "I'm keeping it warm," she said.

The dress rehearsal was their last chance on the main stage before the live show. The vast auditorium was mostly empty, populated only by a skeleton crew of technicians and producers, which somehow made it more intimidating than a full house. One by one, the others ran through their polished, high-energy numbers. Bianca's performance was a spectacle of flashing lights and backup dancers, her pop anthem delivered with a flawless, icy precision. It was impressive, in the way a perfectly engineered machine is impressive. When it was Zola’s turn, Marcus the producer called out from the darkness, "Alright, Zola, let's see if we've tamed that beast of a song. Keep it clean for the cameras."

Zola walked to the single stool in the centre of the stage, the cavernous space making her feel both small and significant. She took a breath, found Kai's empty chair at the judges' table, and pictured him telling her to find what was underneath. She began to play 'My Own Shoes'. The opening chords were quiet, intimate, drawing the scattered attention of the crew towards her. She sang the first verse, her voice a near-whisper, full of the vulnerability she had once tried to hide behind a wall of anger. A sound engineer in the front row, who had been scrolling on his phone, slowly lowered it. In the wings, she could see the silhouette of Bianca, arms crossed, watching.

Then the chorus came. The power that swelled in her voice was different now. It was not the ragged edge of rage, but the deep, resonant strength of conviction. It was a soaring, defiant claiming of her own story. *"I've got a history you can't erase / A thousand miles of saving grace / You can't walk my path, you can't steal my views / 'Cause I'm standing steady in my own shoes."* The notes filled the empty auditorium, the raw honesty of her voice doing what no flashing light or backup dancer could: it commanded silence. It demanded to be felt. When the final chord faded, a profound stillness held the room for a beat. Then, one of the cameramen started clapping, a slow, steady rhythm that was soon joined by a few other technicians. Marcus was silent, his silhouette unmoving in the dark. Zola had no idea what he was thinking.

As she walked off stage, her heart beating a steady, triumphant rhythm, she passed Bianca in the wings. The smug confidence was gone from the other woman's face. In its place was a flicker of something Zola had never seen there before: uncertainty. It was there for only a second before the mask of cool indifference snapped back into place, but Zola had seen it. The song had landed. It had hit its mark not as an attack, but as a truth so undeniable it couldn't be ignored or dismissed. That was a victory in itself.

Hours later, the energy backstage was a palpable, living thing. Thandi had arrived, her eyes wide with a mixture of terror and excitement. She threw her arms around Zola. "You look… calm," she said, her voice full of awe. "Are you secretly on drugs they don't know about? Should I be worried?" Zola laughed, a genuine, relaxed sound. "Just tea and adrenaline," she said, squeezing her friend's hand. "I'm okay, T. I'm ready." Just then, Bianca swept past, flanked by her manager and a stylist making last-minute adjustments to her shimmering outfit. She paused, turning to Zola with a smile that was all teeth. "Break a leg, darling," she said, her voice dripping with saccharine condescension. "You'll need it. My song has a pyrotechnics budget. I hear yours just has feelings."

The jab, which a week ago would have crippled Zola with self-doubt, now felt pathetic and weak. She looked Bianca directly in the eye, her own expression serene. "That’s okay, Bia," she replied, her voice soft but clear. "I brought my own fire." Bianca’s smile faltered. For the first time, she seemed to have no comeback. She just stared for a second before turning with a flick of her perfect blonde hair and stalking off towards the stage entrance. Thandi stared at Zola, her jaw on the floor. "Okay," she breathed. "Who are you and what have you done with my best friend? That was badass."

The show began in a whirlwind of flashing lights and roaring crowds. Zola watched the first few performances on a monitor in the wings, her heart a steady drum against her ribs. Leo’s piano piece was breathtakingly beautiful, and Esther’s gospel number had the entire audience on their feet, their hands in the air. Then it was Bianca's turn. It was, Zola had to admit, a flawless performance. The pyrotechnics went off on cue, the dancers hit their marks, and Bianca’s voice soared through the pop anthem without a single misstep. The crowd loved it. The judges, apart from Kai who remained poker-faced, looked impressed. Then, the host was saying her name. "A voice that stopped us all in our tracks in the semi-finals, please welcome Zola Nkosi!"

Thandi gave her one last, bone-crushing hug. "Go sing your truth," she whispered fiercely in her ear. Zola walked from the chaotic darkness of the wings into the blazing white light of the stage. The sound of the crowd was a deafening roar. She walked to the stool, the familiar weight of Nomvula on her lap a comforting anchor. As she settled, the crowd's roar quieted to an expectant hush. She found her spot in the audience where Thandi was sitting, then her eyes scanned the judges' table. Kai was leaning forward slightly, his expression patient, waiting. He gave a single, almost imperceptible nod. It was all she needed.

She took a breath and began to play. The first few notes of 'My Own Shoes' fell into the silent arena like pebbles into a still lake. Her voice, when it came, was quiet, vulnerable, drawing twenty thousand people into the intimacy of her story. She didn't look at the crowd, the cameras, or the judges. She looked inward, to the place where the song lived. She sang of her Gogo's hands, of the ghosts of sad songs in old coffee shops, of the relentless belief of a friend who refused to let her give up. She poured every bit of her journey—the doubt, the fear, the tiny flicker of hope, the final, blazing resolve—into the performance.

When she reached the chorus, her voice swelled, no longer holding back. It was a wave of pure, unvarnished emotion, a declaration of survival and selfhood that seemed to shake the very air in the room. The lights, the cameras, the entire spectacle of the show melted away. There was only the song. On the giant screens, the director chose to stay on a tight shot of her face, her eyes closed, her expression one of painful, beautiful release. She wasn't performing anymore. She was testifying.

The final chord hung in the air, resonant and clear. For a breathtaking second, there was absolute silence. It was a silence more profound and more telling than any applause. Then, the auditorium erupted. The sound was a physical thing, a tidal wave of cheering and clapping that washed over her, so immense it felt like it could hold her up. Zola opened her eyes, blinking against the lights and the sudden sting of a tear that traced a hot path down her cheek. Her gaze fell on the judges' table. Gavin, the miserable bastard, was staring at her, his pen still, his mouth slightly agape. But her eyes found Kai. He wasn't cheering. He was just clapping, slowly and deliberately, a wide, profound smile of approval on his face that spoke volumes more than any score could. She had done it. Whatever the outcome, whatever Bianca did, whatever the voters decided, in that moment, she knew she had already won.The host, a man with teeth so white they seemed to glow, finally stepped forward as the applause began to subside, letting it die down just enough for his voice to cut through. "Zola Nkosi! Zola, Zola, Zola. The quiet one comes out swinging in the final round! Judges, what did you make of that?" The camera panned to the table, landing first on Gavin, the critic who had built a career on his withering takedowns. Zola braced herself.

Gavin stared down at his notes for a long moment, then looked directly into the camera, his usual sour pucker replaced by an expression of grudging awe. "I've made it very clear this season that I am not a fan of... unpolished emotionalism," he began, and Zola’s stomach tightened. "But that was not unpolished. That was raw, yes, but it was also meticulously controlled. The vocal dynamics, the lyrical structure... that was the work of a songwriter, not just a singer. It was authentic, and for the first time in a long time on this show, I actually believed someone."

The relief that washed over Zola was so potent it made her dizzy. The other judges offered a chorus of effusive praise, talking about her storytelling and her unique voice, but it was all a blur. Her attention was fixed on the end of the table, on the one man whose opinion mattered more than a record deal. Finally, the host turned to him. "And Kai, our guest of honour. You've been working with our finalists this week. What are your thoughts on Zola's final performance?"

Kai leaned into his microphone, the vast auditorium falling into a reverent silence. "I think in this business, we talk a lot about 'fire'," he said, his voice a low, resonant hum that felt more like a conversation than a judgment. "We talk about passion, about a spark. Zola has always had that fire. But what she did tonight was much harder than just letting it burn. She showed us the kindling. She showed us the slow, patient work of keeping a flame alive in the wind and the rain. She didn't just sing a song about her truth; she stood here and she built a home out of it, and then she invited every single one of us inside. That's not talent. That's artistry."

The commercial break was a sudden, jarring shift from the high emotional drama of the stage to the frantic, functional chaos of backstage. The finalists were herded into the Green Room for one last, agonizing wait. The Coastal Vibe boys were nervously chugging water, their bravado from earlier completely gone. Esther was sitting quietly in a corner, radiating a calm that Zola envied. Zola’s phone buzzed in her pocket, a frantic series of texts from Thandi that were little more than keyboard smashes and a hundred exclamation points. She smiled, slipping the phone back without reading them all. The feeling didn't need translation.

Bianca was not calm. She was pacing by the far wall, her manager speaking to her in a low, urgent hiss. Her perfect, shimmering facade had cracked, and through it, Zola could see the raw, desperate ambition that had always driven her. She looked up and caught Zola watching her, and her eyes, for a moment, were stripped of their usual condescension. They were just scared. In that instant, Zola felt a surprising, fleeting pang of something that wasn't anger or triumph, but a strange, sad flicker of empathy. They were both just girls who wanted to be heard. Their methods were different, but the hunger was the same. Then Bianca’s expression hardened again, the mask back in place, and she turned away.

"Two minutes, everyone! Final positions on stage!" The pink-haired assistant’s voice was sharp. They filed out, lining up in the wings one last time. Esther caught Zola’s arm, her grip firm and warm. "Whatever happens now, you hold your head high, you hear me? You already won," she murmured, her voice full of conviction. Zola nodded, a lump forming in her throat. She took her place on stage, the lights hot on her face, the noise of the crowd a distant, abstract roar. The host stood in the centre, holding a single, shimmering golden envelope. Zola’s eyes found Thandi in the front row. Her friend was gripping the seat in front of her, her knuckles white, her entire being focused on Zola. They locked eyes, and in that one look, a decade of shared dreams, cheap wine, and unwavering support passed between them. Zola gave a tiny, almost imperceptible shake of her head that said, *It's okay. We already did it.*

"This has been our most talented, most exciting season ever," the host boomed, stretching the moment until it was thin and humming with tension. "But there can be only one winner. The votes have been counted and verified. The winner of Starlight Search, and a recording contract with a major international label, is..." He tore open the envelope, his eyes scanning the card inside. The drumroll was a physical assault, a frantic heartbeat shaking the floor. Zola felt her own breath catch, not for herself, but for the girl who had named her guitar Nomvula in a cramped flat in Observatory, for the hope she had almost let die a thousand times.

The host looked up, a wide smile breaking across his face. "Zola Nkosi!"

The world dissolved into a confetti-filled, sound-blasted hurricane. For a second, Zola didn’t move. The name didn’t register. It was just a sound. Then Esther was wrapping her in a massive, joyful hug, and the boy band was clapping her on the back, and Leo was grinning at her, and the reality of it hit her like a physical force. It was her. The name he had said was hers. A sob, a laugh, and a gasp all escaped her at once as the host guided her to the centre of the stage. The roar from the crowd was a living thing, a wave of sound that seemed to lift her off her feet.

The host thrust a microphone into her hand and she stared at it blankly, confetti sticking to her tear-streaked cheeks. "I... thank you," she managed, the words a hoarse whisper. Her eyes frantically searched the stage. She saw Bianca, her face a frozen mask of a smile, offer a stiff, jerky hug before turning and walking swiftly off the stage, the first to retreat from the glare of someone else's victory. Zola watched her go, the flicker of empathy returning, just for a moment.

Then someone was placing a heavy, star-shaped trophy in her hands and the weight of it was real, solid, anchoring her back to the unbelievable moment. Her song, her real song, began to play over the speakers, her own voice singing back to her. Her eyes scanned the judges' table. Gavin was applauding, actually applauding. But her gaze landed on Kai. He wasn't on his feet like the others. He was sitting calmly, and he slowly lifted his own mug, which a production assistant had apparently refilled, in a silent, respectful toast. A private acknowledgment from one artist to another. That was the real prize. Then her eyes found the crowd, searching until she saw a figure scrambling past security. It was Thandi, her face a beautiful, messy collage of tears and laughter. She was pointing at Zola, then at herself, mouthing the words they had said to each other so many times. "We did it." Zola clutched the trophy to her chest, laughing through her tears as she looked at her friend, her witness, her partner in the impossible dream that had just, against all odds, come true.The transition from the blazing stage to the frenetic labyrinth of backstage was a violent sensory whiplash. The air, thick with the metallic scent of confetti and human sweat, was a cacophony of ringing cellphones and congratulations shouted from all directions. Zola was a magnet, and everyone around her was iron filings, pulling her into hugs, thrusting phones in her face for selfies, and patting her on the back with a familiarity she found deeply unsettling. She clutched the heavy, star-shaped trophy to her chest like a shield, a dazed, plastered-on smile her only defence. It was Thandi who acted as her rudder in this storm, her arm linked firmly through Zola’s, her voice a sharp, protective barrier against the tide. “Give her space, people,” Thandi commanded, her five-foot-three frame radiating the authority of a battle-hardened general. “She needs to breathe. No, she can’t tell you her life story right now, she just won! Back up!”

They were swept into a small, starkly lit room for a press conference, the flashes of cameras creating a disorienting strobe effect. A dozen voices shot questions at her simultaneously, a barrage of inane inquiries about how it felt and what she would buy first. Zola blinked into the lights, her mind a complete blank. How did it feel? It felt like noise. It felt like her ears were full of cotton wool and her brain was floating three feet above her head. She opened her mouth, and to her surprise, Kai's words came out. "It feels," she said, her voice surprisingly steady, "like I finally found a way to say what I needed to say, and people listened." It was a better answer than she knew she had in her. Thandi squeezed her arm, a silent "well done." The questions kept coming, a blur of sound and light, until Marcus, the producer, materialised beside her and clapped his hands. "Alright, that’s enough for tonight, everyone. Our star needs to celebrate. A car is waiting."

The car was a sleek black sedan with tinted windows, a silent, leather-scented capsule that felt like another planet as it pulled away from the chaotic studio lot. The sudden quiet was deafening. Zola leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, the city lights smearing into long, abstract streaks as they drove. The trophy sat on the seat between her and Thandi, gleaming under the passing streetlights. For a long minute, neither of them spoke. Then, Thandi let out a long, shaky breath and started to laugh, a hysterical, wheezing sound that was half-sob. "You did it," she gasped, tears streaming down her face. "You actually bloody did it. That miserable bastard Gavin practically proposed to you on live television." Zola started laughing too, a helpless, exhausted laugh that shook her whole body. They fell against each other in a heap, laughing and crying until their stomachs hurt, the sheer, impossible reality of the night finally breaking through the wall of shock. "Mr. Henderson," Zola choked out between laughs. "I have to quit my job. I have to call Mr. Henderson." The thought was so absurd, so mundane in the face of the monumental shift that had just occurred, that it sent them into another fit of laughter.

They didn't go back to the sterile hotel. Thandi directed the driver to Observatory, to the crumbling Victorian house that held Zola’s entire world in two small rooms. They climbed the familiar creaking stairs, Thandi carrying the trophy like a sacred relic. The moment Zola unlocked her door and stepped inside, the competing smells of old books, her unwashed coffee cup from that morning, and the sweet wood of her guitar filled her lungs. It was the first thing that had felt real all night. She walked over to the window and looked out at the quiet street, at the familiar jacaranda tree and the glow of the corner café. The city from up here didn't look like a glittering prize; it just looked like home. Thandi placed the trophy on her small, cluttered dining table, where it looked absurdly out of place next to a stack of overdue library books and a half-eaten packet of biscuits. "Well," Thandi said, her voice soft with awe. "That's going to take some getting used to." Zola just nodded, her throat tight with an emotion so big it had no name. The exhaustion of the week, the week before, the last three years, washed over her in a single, crushing wave. She sank onto her worn-out sofa, and for the first time since she had walked on stage, she felt the silence not as an absence of noise, but as a profound and welcome peace.

The next morning began not with a frantic buzz from her phone, but with a firm, official knock on her door. Zola, who had fallen asleep in her clothes on the sofa, stumbled to her feet, her head thick with a sleep that had been too deep and not nearly long enough. It was a courier, holding a sleek black envelope. Inside was a single sheet of heavy cardstock. It was an invitation, or rather, a summons: a meeting at ten a.m. at the record label’s headquarters on the Foreshore. "Bring your guitar," the note added in a curt, printed script. Thandi, who had crashed on a pile of cushions on the floor, was instantly awake, her eyes gleaming. "This is it! The big leagues! You need to wear something that says 'I'm an artist, but I'm also commercially viable'." Zola ended up in her standard black jeans and a clean t-shirt, figuring that if they signed her for her authenticity, they could get her authentic wardrobe, too. Nomvula on her back, she and Thandi took an Uber into the city, watching the familiar slopes of Table Mountain give way to the sharp, glass-and-steel angles of the financial district.

The record label's offices were on the thirtieth floor, a world of pale wood, brushed steel, and panoramic views of the harbour. It was a space so quiet and minimalist it felt like a modern art gallery. Marcus was waiting for them in a boardroom with a glass wall that made Zola feel like she was floating over the city. His smile was wider and more business-like than ever. "Zola! Our champion! Welcome to your new home." He launched into a dizzying speech about marketing strategies, album timelines, and potential producers in Los Angeles. He kept using the phrase "your brand" and "target demographic," and with every word, Zola felt a new kind of anxiety begin to creep in, a cold fear that she had escaped one machine only to be fed into another, much bigger one. "Your song, 'My Own Shoes', is fantastic. A real anthem. We see it as the lead single, of course," Marcus said, pacing in front of the glass wall. "We'll just need to tighten it up a bit. Bring in a stronger hook for the chorus, maybe add a bridge with a good synth pad underneath. Give it that global appeal."

Zola’s hand tightened on the neck of her guitar. "I don't think it needs a synth pad," she said, her voice quiet but firm. Marcus stopped pacing and gave her a patient, slightly condescending smile. "Of course, of course, your artistic vision is paramount. We just want to give it the best possible chance of success." The door opened before Zola had to formulate a response. Kai walked in, holding two cups of coffee, just as he had in the studio. He looked completely at ease in the corporate shark tank, his dreadlocks and calm demeanour a stark contrast to Marcus's expensive suit. He handed one coffee to Zola and nodded at Thandi before taking a seat. "Morning," he said, his presence immediately shifting the power dynamic in the room. "I was just listening to Zola's final performance again. The magic of that song, Marcus, is its space. It's in the breaths she takes between the lines. A synth pad would just be noise in a room that's already perfectly furnished." Marcus's smile tightened. "Kai, always the purist. We have to think about radio play." "You have to think about not breaking the thing you just bought," Kai retorted, his voice still gentle but with an unmistakable edge of steel. He turned to Zola, his eyes warm and direct. "They will try to make you into a product. My only advice is this: remember you're a person. A person who writes songs. The rest is just noise." He took a sip of his coffee, effectively ending the debate. Zola felt a profound wave of gratitude. She had not just won a record deal; she had won an ally.## Chapter 5

The silence that followed Kai’s statement was a living entity. It pressed down on the gleaming boardroom table, sucked the air from the room, and made Marcus’s expensive suit look suddenly ill-fitting. The producer, a man accustomed to being the loudest voice in any room, seemed to shrink. He cleared his throat, his professional smile flickering back to life, though it was a dimmer, less confident version of its former self. He adjusted his tie, a small, fussy gesture that betrayed his discomfort. The power had shifted, and everyone knew it.

"Of course, Kai, of course. We protect the art. That's always been our ethos," Marcus said, the words sounding hollow even to Zola’s ears. He pivoted, his business-school training kicking in as he sought to reclaim control of the meeting. "But one song, however brilliant, does not make an album. Zola, the public is hungry. The momentum from the show is a wave, and we have to ride it. We need ten more of these. What else is in that notebook of yours? We need to know what we're working with." The question, though framed as an inquiry, felt like a demand. The pressure was back, just in a different guise. No longer about changing her song, but about mass-producing its magic.

Zola looked down at her hands, at the calluses on her fingertips from years of pressing strings. She thought of her notebooks, pages filled with scratched-out lines, chord progressions that led nowhere, verses about rain-streaked bus windows and the ghosts of conversations. They were fragments, emotional Polaroids, not a collection of hits waiting to be recorded. The thought of turning that private, messy scrapbook into a commercial product was terrifying. "I have… pieces," she said, her voice small. "Ideas. I don't write to a deadline. I write when a song needs to be written."

Before Marcus could pounce on the perceived weakness in her statement, Kai leaned forward again. "And that's why she won," he said calmly, addressing Marcus but looking at Zola. "You can't farm authenticity like it's a cash crop. Give her space. Give her an advance so she doesn't have to worry about rent, and give her a month to just be a writer. Let her find the other nine stories. They’re in there." He then turned his full attention to Zola, his eyes kind. "Don't think about 'an album'. That's a marketing term. Just think about the next song. After everything that's happened, what story do you need to tell now? Start there."

Marcus, seeing he was outmanoeuvred, sighed and adopted a magnanimous tone. "A month. Fine. A creative retreat, of sorts. We'll draw up the papers for the advance today. And in four weeks, we'll reconvene and talk producers. I have a list. We'll find someone who gets your… unique vibe." The word 'unique' was still laced with a faint hint of skepticism, but it was a concession nonetheless. The meeting concluded with brisk handshakes. As Zola and Thandi turned to leave, Kai caught Zola's eye. "Don't listen to the noise," he mouthed silently, a final piece of advice that she clutched like a talisman.

Stepping out of the air-conditioned lobby and back into the humid, windswept reality of the Foreshore was like surfacing for air. Zola and Thandi walked in silence for a full block, the roar of the city traffic washing over them. Finally, Thandi stopped in the middle of the pavement, causing a businessman to swerve around her with an annoyed grunt. "Did that really just happen?" Thandi asked, her voice a whisper of disbelief. "Did Kai, the actual Kai, just go to war for you against a suit over a synth pad?" She looked at Zola, her eyes wide. "And the advance! Zola, you're not just a singer anymore. You're a professionally funded artist! You can buy cheese that isn't the cheap, sweaty kind! You can quit your job!"

The words, "quit your job," landed with a simple, profound weight. It was the most tangible symbol of this new reality. They decided to bypass their usual celebratory haunts. This moment called for something different. On a whim, they went to a small café on Bree Street, a place they’d always considered too expensive, and ordered two elaborate, frothy cappuccinos and two slices of a ridiculously decadent chocolate cake. As they sat there, watching the fashionable people of Cape Town drift past, Zola felt the first real, uncomplicated tendrils of joy begin to unfurl in her chest. The money wasn't just money. It was freedom. It was time. It was the ability to sit in a nice café in the middle of a weekday and not worry about being late for a shift. "I'm going to do it this afternoon," Zola said, her voice firm. "I'm going to go and quit." Thandi raised her cappuccino, her eyes shining. "To unemployment," she declared. "The best kind."

Later that afternoon, Zola walked the familiar route to the coffee shop. The bell above the door chimed, the same sound that had punctuated the last four years of her life. The air smelled exactly the same: of burnt sugar, cleaning supplies, and damp earth from the potted plant by the door. A few customers were scattered at the tables. It was as if she had stepped back into her old life. And there, behind the counter, was Mr. Henderson, scowling at a receipt. He looked up as she approached, his expression shifting from its default sourness to something more complex. "Nkosi," he grumbled, his voice low. "I was wondering if you'd show your face. Thought you'd be off in Johannesburg by now, swimming in a pool of money."

Zola leaned against the counter, the cool stainless steel familiar under her elbows. "Not yet," she said with a small smile. "I came to tell you I have to quit, Mr. Henderson." He grunted, polishing a glass with more force than was necessary. "Took you long enough. The phone hasn't stopped ringing. People asking if the 'Starlight girl' is working. It's been a nightmare." He paused, setting the glass down and peering at her over the top of his spectacles. "You were a terrible barista, you know. Always forgetting orders. Head in the clouds. Made a decent flat white, I'll give you that, but your focus was never here." He said it all with his usual gruffness, but his eyes held a different story.

"I know," Zola said softly. "Thank you for… for everything. For letting me work the strange hours. For not firing me when I was late because a song wouldn't let me sleep." Mr. Henderson grunted again, turning to fiddle with the espresso machine. "Just don't forget us little people when you're famous," he said, his back still to her. "And don't write any songs about a grumpy old man in a coffee shop." He turned back around, a small, paper cup in his hand. "Here," he said, pushing it across the counter. "On the house. For the road." It was an espresso, dark and potent. Zola took the small cup, its warmth seeping into her hand. "Thank you, boss," she said, her voice thick. "For everything." She drank the espresso in one quick, bitter gulp, a final taste of her old life. Then she placed the cup on the counter, turned, and walked out the door into the bright afternoon sun, the bell chiming one last time behind her. She didn't look back.The walk home from the café was an exercise in seeing the familiar through a new lens. Every crack in the pavement, every burst of graffiti on a wall, every overgrown bougainvillea spilling over a garden fence was a detail in a landscape she was no longer just passing through on her way to or from a shift. This was her world now, full-time. The afternoon sun, usually a reminder that she was halfway through a long day of serving others, now felt like a luxury, a warm blanket she could wrap herself in for as long as she wanted. The feeling wasn't explosive joy; it was quieter, a deep, cellular unwinding of tension she hadn't even realised she was carrying. She had walked out of that coffee shop and left a version of herself behind, the one who measured her days in espresso shots and wiped down counters while dreaming of a different life. Now, that different life was simply… life.

Back in the flat, Thandi had lit a candle and put on some old-school kwaito music, a celebratory atmosphere that felt both perfect and slightly surreal. They sprawled on the floor, making a list on a crumpled napkin of all the things Zola could now afford: a new mattress, a guitar pedal she’d been eyeing for a year, a trip to the dentist, and, Thandi insisted, at least one ridiculously expensive block of imported cheese. It was in the middle of this giddy, nonsensical planning that Zola’s phone vibrated with a distinct, official-sounding buzz. It was an email from her bank. Subject: Confirmation of Electronic Funds Transfer. Her fingers trembled as she opened it. Inside was a string of numbers that her brain struggled to process. The advance. It was more money than she had ever seen in one place, enough to live on for years. She showed the screen to Thandi. The music seemed to fade, the candlelight flicker, the world narrowing to the glowing numbers on the small screen. The laughter died in their throats, replaced by a profound, shared silence. It was real. The trophy was a symbol, the contract was a promise, but the money was a fact, a heavy, solid weight in her bank account that anchored her new reality to the earth.

The next morning, Zola woke to the sun streaming through her window and, for the first time in her adult life, the knowledge that there was nowhere she had to be. The freedom she had craved was a vast, terrifyingly blank expanse. She made coffee, sat on her worn sofa, and picked up Nomvula. This was her job now. This was work. She placed her fingers on the fretboard, ready for the torrent of new songs that were surely waiting to be written. But nothing came. Her mind, instead of being filled with melodies, was filled with a low-grade hum of anxiety. Marcus’s voice echoed in her head, talking about lead singles and target demographics. She tried a chord progression, but it sounded clumsy. She sang a line, but her voice felt thin and self-conscious. The quiet, sacred space where she and her guitar had always met had been invaded by a crowd of invisible executives and the imagined expectations of a million new listeners. The blank page wasn't an opportunity anymore; it was an indictment.

Frustrated, she put the guitar down and decided to go for a walk, hoping the familiar streets of Observatory would shake her out of her stupor. She bought a koeksister from a corner shop, the sweet, sticky syrup a taste of her old, uncomplicated life. As she stood on the pavement, a young woman, no older than sixteen, stopped dead in her tracks a few feet away. She was holding her phone, her thumb hovering over the screen. "Oh my god," the girl whispered, her eyes wide. "You're Zola Nkosi. From 'Starlight Search'." Zola’s heart gave a nervous jump. "Ja," she managed, trying for a casual smile that felt like a grimace. "That's me." The girl fumbled with her phone. "Can I… would it be okay if I got a picture? My mom and I voted for you like a hundred times. Your last song made my mom cry." Zola found herself posing awkwardly, a stranger in her own skin, while the girl snapped a quick, blurry selfie. The encounter was sweet, earnest, and completely unsettling. It was a stark reminder that she was no longer just Zola, the quiet girl from the coffee shop. She was now public property, a story people told themselves, a face on a screen.

She recounted the experience to Thandi later that day, slouched on the sofa, the unease of the encounter clinging to her like a damp coat. "I feel like a fraud, T," she confessed, her voice low. "I have all this time, all this freedom, and I can't write a single line. It's like the part of my brain that makes songs went on holiday the second I won. And now people recognise me on the street. They look at me like they know me. How am I supposed to write honest songs if I feel like I'm being watched all the time?" Thandi listened patiently, her expression serious. "Because your old life is what you wrote about," she said, her insight cutting through Zola's panic. "You wrote about the struggle, the longing, the feeling of being on the outside looking in. You just won. You're on the inside now. It's a different country, Zee. You need a new passport. Kai was right. You can't find your new voice in the middle of all this noise. You need to get out."

The idea, which had been a vague suggestion in a boardroom, now became a necessity, a lifeline. Disappear. Not to run away from her new life, but to find a way to live inside it. That evening, Zola sat at her small table, her laptop open. She didn't search for fancy hotels or wellness retreats. She typed "self-catering cottage, quiet, West Coast" into the search bar. She scrolled past listings with infinity pools and designer furniture. Then she saw it. A small, whitewashed fisherman's cottage in a town she'd barely heard of. The photos showed a simple room, a small kitchen, and a wooden porch with two chairs that looked directly out onto a vast, turbulent expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. There was no television. The description promised spotty Wi-Fi and the constant sound of waves. It looked windswept, solitary, and profoundly peaceful. It looked like a place where she could finally hear herself think. Without a second thought, she booked it for three weeks, the transaction a quiet, decisive act of self-preservation. It was the first thing she had bought with her new freedom. Not cheese or a guitar pedal, but a room of her own by the sea. A place to meet the stranger she had just become.The drive up the R27 was a gradual shedding of skin. With every kilometre that put Cape Town further in her rearview mirror, Zola felt a layer of the city’s frantic energy peel away. Thandi had insisted on driving her, the little hatchback loaded with Zola’s guitar, a single duffel bag, and two large grocery bags filled with what Thandi deemed "creative essentials": pasta, tinned tomatoes, good coffee, a bottle of respectable red wine, and an obscene amount of chocolate. Their farewell in the dusty parking area of the cottage rental office was brief and thick with unspoken emotion. "Don't you dare come back without at least one song about a lonely seagull," Thandi had commanded, her voice attempting a lightheartedness that was betrayed by the tightness of her hug. "Call me. But not too much. Be lonely. Be brilliant." Zola watched the small car disappear down the road, a plume of dust in its wake, until she was left standing alone with her bags and her guitar, the silence of the small West Coast town settling around her like a blanket.

The town, Paternoster, was a scattering of whitewashed cottages huddled against a curve of bone-white beach, looking as though it had been carved from salt and shells. The air tasted of brine and drying seaweed, and the only sounds were the shriek of gulls and the relentless, rhythmic sigh of the ocean. Her cottage was at the very end of a sandy track, its small wooden porch, or 'stoep', looking directly out onto the churning, grey-green Atlantic. Inside, it was spartan and clean: a small bed with a simple quilt, a tiny kitchen, and a living area with two armchairs facing the sea. It was perfect. She unpacked her few belongings, placing her books on the small bedside table and her bag of groceries on the counter. Nomvula’s case, however, she left standing by the door, untouched. It felt like a suitcase full of work, an obligation, and she wasn’t ready to face it yet.

For the first three days, Zola did everything but write. She walked for hours along the windswept beach, her boots sinking into the cold, damp sand. She collected smooth, sea-worn stones and twisted pieces of driftwood, arranging them on the windowsill like sacred objects. She sat on the stoep, wrapped in a blanket, and watched the fishing boats chug out in the misty dawn and return in the golden light of late afternoon. The silence was not the peaceful balm she had imagined; it was a loud, roaring void that her brain rushed to fill with noise. The critical voices of Marcus and Annelise, the imagined weight of public expectation, the fear of the blank page – they were all louder here, with nothing to distract her. She felt a rising tide of panic. She was wasting time. The label's money was draining away with every tide she watched go out. The freedom she had paid for felt like a cage of her own making, and the guilt was a constant, sour taste in her mouth.

On the fourth morning, driven by a need for human contact that didn’t involve a screen, she walked to the small shop near the harbour. It was a dim, cluttered space that sold everything from bread and milk to fishing line and brightly coloured plastic buckets. An old woman with a face as weathered as a piece of driftwood and kind, crinkled eyes sat behind the counter, knitting. She didn't look up as Zola entered, merely nodding in acknowledgment. Zola wandered the aisles, picking up a loaf of bread and a small carton of milk, her movements slow and deliberate. As she paid, the woman finally spoke, her voice a low, gravelly rasp. "You're new," she stated, not as a question. "Just visiting," Zola replied. The woman’s eyes flickered down to Zola’s hands, noticing the calluses on her fingertips. "You play?" she asked. Zola nodded. "Guitar." A slow smile spread across the woman's face. "My husband, he used to play the concertina. Every night after the boats came in. The sea needs music, he always said. It gets lonely." The simple, profound statement struck Zola with the force of a physical blow. The sea needs music. It gets lonely. The woman handed her the change, her brief, anonymous connection asking for nothing in return, and Zola walked back to her cottage with the words echoing in her head.

That evening, the sun sank into the ocean in a spectacular, fiery blaze of orange and violet. Zola sat on the cold sand, watching the colours bleed across the water. She thought of the old woman’s words. She wasn’t here to write a hit for Marcus or an album for the label. She wasn’t even here to prove something to herself. She was here because the sea was lonely, and so was she. The shared solitude was a bridge between them. A single, mournful gull cried overhead, its call a perfect, lonely note against the bass rumble of the waves. It wasn't a sad sound. It was just a true one. A melody, simple and unadorned, began to form in her mind, mirroring the gull's cry and the rhythm of the waves washing ashore. It was a quiet tune, full of space and air. For the first time in over a week, she felt the familiar, gentle pull of a song wanting to be born.

Back in the cottage, as the last light faded from the sky, Zola finally walked over to the guitar case by the door. Her hands were steady as she unclipped the latches and lifted Nomvula out. The familiar weight of the guitar in her lap was a profound comfort, a homecoming. She didn't force it. She didn't try to write. She just sat in the gathering dark and played, her fingers finding the simple melody she had heard on the beach. She played for the lonely sea. She played for the old woman's husband and his concertina. She played for the quiet, whitewashed cottage that had held her anxiety without judgment. The chords that emerged were not angry or defiant, nor were they saccharine or commercial. They were elemental, like the wind and the water. They were chords of acceptance. Her voice, when it came, was not a performance. It was a breath, a whisper that mingled with the sound of the ocean outside her window. The first line arrived, not as a clever hook, but as a simple observation, a truth offered up to the quiet room. "The tide comes in, the tide goes out," she sang, "and I'm still here to write about it."That line became an anchor, a single, solid point in the vast, shifting landscape of her new life. Zola didn't push it. She let it sit with her, repeating it softly, a mantra against the roar of the ocean. The melody that wrapped around the words was not complex; it was simple and cyclical, like a lullaby or a folk tune passed down through generations. It rose and fell with the rhythm of her own breathing. She played it over and over, not to perfect it, but just to live inside it for a while. The fear of the blank page, the pressure from the label, the ghost of Bianca’s ambition—all of it receded, pushed back by the gentle but insistent tide of this new song. It was a song that wasn't trying to be anything, that wasn't fighting or declaring or proving. It was simply a song that was.

The following days found a new rhythm. Zola would wake with the sun, make coffee, and take it and her guitar out onto the stoep. The chill morning air would raise goosebumps on her arms as she watched the sea, a notebook open on her lap. The words for the new song, which she began to think of as 'Tide Song', came not in a rush, but as patient observations. She wrote about the way the light changed on the water's surface, from a dull, pewter grey in the morning to a blinding sheet of diamonds at noon. She wrote about the fleets of cormorants flying low and fast across the bay, their wings almost skimming the waves. These small, true details wove themselves around the central theme, grounding the metaphor in a real, tangible world. Her creative process was no longer an internal battle; it had become a conversation with the place she was in.

Once 'Tide Song' had found its shape, a quiet, three-verse narrative of acceptance and endurance, something within Zola unlocked. It was as if that first song had been the key, and now the door was swinging open. The anxieties didn't vanish, but they no longer sat in the driver's seat; they were relegated to the back, grumbling passengers on a journey she was now directing. Ideas for other songs began to surface like smooth stones revealed by a receding tide. She wrote a sketch of a melody inspired by the mournful sound of the foghorn she heard one misty afternoon. She scribbled down lyrical fragments about the gnarled, resilient milkwood trees that dotted the coastline, their branches permanently bent by the wind. She even started a humorous, bluesy tune about a grumpy fisherman who complained about the tourists but secretly enjoyed the attention. Her notebook, which had lain accusingly empty for a week, began to fill with a messy, joyful scrawl.

Her second week in Paternoster was drawing to a close when she finally felt ready to reach out. She missed Thandi’s voice, her unwavering, earthy presence. She dialled her number late one afternoon, sitting on the stoep as the sky began its slow burn towards sunset. The connection was terrible, Thandi’s voice crackling in and out, lost in bursts of static. “Zee! Are you alive? I was about to send a search party! Have you been eaten by a shark? Are you living on kelp? Are you writing?” The questions came in a frantic, loving torrent. Zola laughed, a full, easy sound that felt foreign and wonderful. “I’m alive, T. No sharks. And yes, I’m writing.” The simple statement hung in the air, full of a quiet, momentous significance.

“You are? For real? Is it good? Is it sad? Please tell me it’s not another song about a grumpy old man in a coffee shop, Henderson has become insufferable enough as it is,” Thandi rattled on, her relief palpable even through the bad connection. “It’s… different,” Zola said. She hesitated for a moment. Sharing a song in its fragile infancy had always been terrifying, but this felt different. She wasn't seeking approval; she was sharing a discovery. “Can I… can I play you something?” The line went quiet for a moment, the static hissing like a held breath. “I would love that more than anything,” Thandi’s voice came back, suddenly soft and serious.

So Zola did. She held the phone between her ear and shoulder, found the familiar chords on Nomvula’s fretboard, and, with the sound of the real ocean as her only backing track, she sang ‘Tide Song’. Her voice was unadorned, stripped of all performance. It was just a story told to a friend over a crackling phone line, a dispatch from her new, quiet world. She sang of the constant waves, of learning to stand still and let things wash over you, of finding strength not in fighting the current but in being the shore it breaks against. The final chord hung in the air, mingling with the cries of the gulls and the faint hiss of the poor connection.

For a long moment after she finished, there was only silence from the other end of the line. Zola’s heart fluttered with a familiar flicker of doubt. Maybe it was too simple. Maybe it was boring. “T?” she asked, her voice small. Then she heard a choked, wet sniffle. “Thandi, are you crying?” Thandi let out a watery, shaky laugh. “No. Yes. Oh, shut up. Zee… that was… that was beautiful.” She paused, searching for the words. “My Own Shoes’ was the song that kicked the door down. It was a fire. But this… this is the song you sing after, when you’re sitting in the quiet, looking at what’s left. It’s the sound of you breathing again.”

A profound sense of peace settled over Zola, warm and solid. Thandi understood. She hadn't needed to explain. The song had done its work. They talked for another hour, about everything and nothing, their conversation easy and meandering. As she finally hung up, the first stars were beginning to prick the deep velvet of the sky. Zola looked at her notebook, no longer a source of terror but a collection of promises. She looked out at the vast, dark ocean, its surface shimmering with reflected starlight. She still had a week left in this small, whitewashed haven, but she was no longer hiding. She was healing. She was working. And she knew, with a certainty that resonated deeper than any fear, that when she drove back to Cape Town, she would not be empty-handed.## Chapter 7

The final week in Paternoster was a deep, quiet immersion into the work. The initial breakthrough of 'Tide Song' had cleared a channel, and now the stories flowed through it, steady and clear. Zola’s days fell into a simple, monastic routine: coffee on the stoep at dawn, long walks on the beach where melodies would snag on the salty air, and long afternoons inside the cottage, wrestling lyrics into shape in her notebook. She used her phone to capture the raw material, creating a library of rough, intimate recordings. The audio was imperfect, layered with the incidental music of her surroundings: the insistent cry of the gulls, the hiss of the wind around the cottage eaves, the constant, foundational rumble of the surf. These were not demos; they were sonic Polaroids, capturing a time and a place with unvarnished honesty. She finished the song about the gnarled milkwood trees, a sparse, resilient ballad about bending without breaking. The grumpy fisherman became the subject of a wry, finger-picked blues number full of wit and affection. She even found a melody for the foghorn, a haunting, atmospheric piece that was more of a mood than a song, its sparse lyrics speaking of navigating by sound when you cannot see the way forward.

She did not feel like a star. She felt like a craftsperson. She worked with the focused, patient diligence of a woodcarver or a weaver, sanding a lyric until it was smooth, testing the strength of a chord progression, unpicking a verse that wasn’t true and starting again. The pressure had not vanished entirely, but it had changed its nature. It was no longer the paralysing weight of expectation, but the internal, professional drive to get it right, to honour the songs that were entrusting themselves to her. There were moments of frustration, hours spent staring at a single, stubborn line, but these moments were part of the process, as natural as the tide pulling back before it could surge forward again. She was learning the difference between the drama of inspiration and the quiet dignity of the work itself.

On her last morning, she took Nomvula and walked to the far end of the beach, where a cluster of massive granite boulders, slick with sea-moss, formed a natural amphitheatre. The tide was low, the air still and cold. She sat on a flat, sun-warmed rock and played through her new collection of songs, one after the other. It was not a rehearsal or a performance. It was a farewell. She played them for the ocean that had given them to her, for the whitewashed cottage that had been her sanctuary, and for the quiet, solitary version of herself that she would be leaving behind. As the last chord of 'Tide Song' faded, blending into the sound of the waves, she felt a profound sense of completion. She had come here empty and afraid. She was leaving full, and ready.

The return to Cape Town was a shock to the system. The thrum of traffic on the highway, the sheer density of people and buildings, the electric crackle of the city’s ambition—it all felt overwhelming after the elemental simplicity of the coast. Thandi met her at her flat, her hug a fierce, grounding anchor in the dizzying swirl of re-entry. That night, with the windows closed against the city sounds, Zola turned her living room into a listening lounge. She lit a few candles, made tea, and played the rough phone recordings for Thandi, one by one. Thandi didn’t speak. She lay on the floor with her eyes closed, her entire being focused on the sound coming from the small phone speaker. She listened to the sea-soaked melodies and the wind-battered lyrics, to the songs of resilience and acceptance, to the quiet humour and the deep, resonant peace.

When the last song ended, the silence in the room was thick and emotional. Thandi opened her eyes, and they were shining with unshed tears. "Zee," she whispered, her voice husky. "They're not just songs. They're a place. You brought the whole damn ocean back with you." She sat up, her expression shifting from awe to a fierce, protective resolve. "This is it. This is your voice. Not the one from the show, not the one they think they bought. This one. And if that suit, Marcus, tries to put a synth pad on any of these, I will personally throw his phone in the harbour." Zola felt a surge of gratitude so strong it almost buckled her. Thandi's belief was the final piece of armour she needed.

Her meeting with the label was scheduled for the following Monday. She spent the weekend preparing, but it was a different kind of preparation from the frantic cramming of the 'Starlight Search' days. She didn't practice her performance; she organized her thoughts. She transcribed the lyrics from her notebook into a clean document. She sequenced the rough recordings on her phone into a playlist, an intentional journey that told the story of her time away. She was not going into the boardroom as a contest winner hoping for approval. She was going in as an artist presenting a body of work. She was calm, centered, and sure of the ground she was standing on. On Sunday evening, she polished Nomvula’s wooden body until it gleamed, changed her strings, and tuned the guitar with meticulous care. It felt like a knight preparing their sword for a parley. She wasn’t looking for a fight, but she would not be disarmed. The next day, she would walk back into that glass-and-steel tower, not with the fiery defiance of 'My Own Shoes', but with the quiet, unshakeable strength of the tide.The elevator ascended in unnerving silence, a chrome and glass box lifting them into the rarefied air of the city’s financial stratosphere. Zola stood perfectly still, the familiar weight of Nomvula on her back a solid, comforting pressure. She was not the same person who had entered this building a month ago. The desperate hope and nervous energy had been washed away, replaced by a deep, quiet calm that felt as vast and steady as the ocean she had just left. Beside her, Thandi was a coiled spring of tension, her fierce loyalty radiating from her like heat. She wore a bright yellow dress, a splash of defiant sunshine in the corporate grey, and her hand was clenched into a small, determined fist at her side. She was ready for a fight. Zola was not. She was simply ready to be heard.

They were shown into the same boardroom, the panoramic view of the harbour glittering with a cold, impersonal beauty. Marcus was already there, standing by the glass wall, silhouetted against the sky like a bird of prey. He turned as they entered, his smile sharp and impatient. He was flanked by two other executives, a man and a woman Zola didn’t recognise, who offered brief, appraising nods. The room felt less like a creative space and more like an operating theatre, and Zola knew, with a sudden, chilling certainty, that she was the patient about to be dissected.

“Zola, welcome back,” Marcus began, dispensing with pleasantries. “We trust your seaside sojourn was productive. The hype from the finale is fading faster than a cheap tan, so the clock is ticking. We need to announce an album, and for that, we need a lead single. Show us the hit.” His words were a series of corporate projectiles, aimed to intimidate and disarm. The two other executives leaned forward, their expressions expectant. Zola walked to the table and gently slid her guitar case from her back, but she did not open it. Instead, she placed her phone on the vast, empty expanse of the polished wood surface. The small, unassuming object looked almost comically out of place. Marcus raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. “Are you texting us the song?” he asked, a note of derision in his voice.

“Before I won, my songs were my own,” Zola said, her voice even and clear, resonating with a quiet authority that surprised even herself. “They were written in quiet rooms and on noisy buses. They weren't written for a deadline or a demographic. I couldn’t find that voice here. So I went away to listen. What I have to share with you isn’t a polished single. It’s the raw material. It’s a field recording of where the new songs live.” Without another word, she pressed play. The crackle of static filled the sterile silence, followed by the sound of wind and the distant cry of a seagull. Then, the simple, cyclical chords of ‘Tide Song’ began, Zola’s voice raw and close, layered over the unmistakable rumble of the Atlantic Ocean.

The effect on the room was immediate. The two unknown executives exchanged a look of pure confusion. Marcus’s face, which had been set in a mask of impatient expectation, began to harden into a storm cloud of disbelief and anger. He tapped his lacquered fountain pen against the table, the sharp, rhythmic clicks a frantic counterpoint to the slow, steady rhythm of the song. He wasn’t hearing the melody; he was hearing the hiss of the wind as a technical flaw. He wasn’t hearing the lyrics; he was hearing the lack of a radio-friendly hook. He wasn’t hearing a song at all; he was hearing the sound of his investment being washed out to sea.

As the last chord faded back into the sound of the surf, Marcus slammed his pen down on the table. The sharp crack made Zola flinch. “What in God’s name was that?” he demanded, his voice low and seething with a rage he was barely managing to contain. “That is your hit single? A muffled voice memo with birds squawking all over it? Zola, we gave you a month and a small fortune, and you bring us back an arts-and-crafts project. There is nothing on that recording that I can sell. It’s slow, it’s depressing, and it has no chorus. This is a catastrophic waste of our time.” Thandi started to rise from her chair, her eyes blazing, ready to leap to Zola’s defence, but Zola put a calming hand on her arm, a silent command to wait.

Just as the silence was becoming unbearable, the boardroom door opened and Kai walked in, carrying a takeout tray with four coffees. He moved with his usual unhurried grace, seemingly oblivious to the toxic atmosphere in the room. “Sorry I’m late, traffic was a beast,” he said, placing the coffees on the table. He looked from Marcus’s furious face to Zola’s calm one. “Did I miss the show?” Marcus let out a sharp, humourless laugh. “You missed the disaster, Kai. Zola’s idea of a lead single is apparently a bootleg recording of a funeral dirge she made at the beach.”

Kai picked up one of the coffees and slid it across the table to Zola. He didn’t look at Marcus. He looked at her. “Play it again,” he said softly. Zola hesitated for only a second before pressing play. The wind and the waves and the quiet, honest song filled the room once more. Kai closed his eyes, his head tilted slightly, listening intently. He didn’t just hear it; he absorbed it. The other executives fidgeted, but under Kai’s silent command, they were forced to listen again, to sit with the uncomfortable, uncommercial truth of the sound. When it finished, Kai opened his eyes. “You’re an idiot, Marcus,” he said, his voice quiet, which made the insult all the more devastating.

“You’re listening for a pop song,” Kai continued, his gaze still fixed on the other man. “She’s giving you a confession. You hear a technical flaw; I hear a sense of place so strong I can taste the salt. You hear a lack of a chorus; I hear a structure that mirrors the tide, cyclical and inevitable. You think this is a demo to be fixed. But this isn’t a blueprint, it’s a photograph. The whole point is its honesty. Your producers,” he said, gesturing vaguely at the city beyond the glass, “will try to clean this up. They’ll scrub out the wind and autotune her voice and slap a drum machine on it, and they’ll kill the one thing that makes it special. They will kill its soul.”

Kai leaned back in his chair, his calm dismantling Marcus’s fury brick by brick. “This album doesn’t need a pop producer. It needs an artist. It needs someone who knows that silence is an instrument. It needs David Linde.” He dropped the name into the room like a perfectly weighted stone, and the ripples spread instantly. David Linde was a legendary, almost reclusive producer, famous for his work on atmospheric, critically-acclaimed albums that were revered for their raw beauty and sonic integrity. He was a producer’s producer, an artist’s dream, and notoriously selective. He was the furthest thing from Marcus’s list of hitmakers, and his name carried a weight of cultural capital that Marcus could not ignore.

The two other executives suddenly looked very interested, their expressions shifting from skepticism to intrigue. Marcus was cornered. To argue against David Linde would be to reveal his own commercial preoccupations as tin-eared and unsophisticated. His face flushed a deep, mottled red. He opened his mouth, then closed it again. He was beaten. “Linde is… an interesting choice,” he finally managed, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. “An unconventional, boutique approach. It could work, for a niche market.” Kai smiled, a slow, knowing smile. “Authenticity isn’t a niche market, Marcus. It’s the only one that lasts.” He then turned to Zola, his expression warm and full of pride. “You have more?” he asked. Zola nodded, a slow, relieved smile finally breaking across her own face. “I have a whole album,” she said. And in that moment, she knew it was true.## Chapter 8

The ride down in the elevator was a study in inverted power. Marcus stood facing the doors, his shoulders slumped, his reflection in the polished steel a portrait of sullen defeat. The other two executives, who had entered the room as his allies, now studiously avoided his gaze, occasionally glancing at Zola with a newfound, speculative respect. She was no longer just a contest winner; she was the artist Kai had championed, the potential project of a legend. She was a commodity whose value had just been radically reassessed. Thandi stood beside Zola, practically vibrating with triumphant energy, her bright yellow dress an affront to the muted corporate palette. Kai himself was a pillar of tranquility, his quiet presence taking up more space than Marcus’s deflated rage. He caught Zola’s eye in the reflection and gave her a small, almost imperceptible wink that said, *And that is how it’s done.*

They spilled out onto the sun-drenched plaza, the roar of city traffic a welcome antidote to the boardroom’s airless tension. Marcus and his colleagues broke away immediately, disappearing into the anonymous flow of the lunch-hour crowd without a backward glance. Kai walked with Zola and Thandi towards the street corner, the wind whipping at his dreadlocks. “He’ll be a nightmare for a while,” Kai said, nodding in the direction Marcus had gone. “His ego is bruised. But the other suits heard the name, and their greed is stronger than his pride. They’ll make it happen.” He stopped and turned to face Zola, his expression serious. “I’ll send your recordings to David myself. I can’t promise anything. He’s a difficult man, Zola. He works only on things that move him, and he has a habit of chewing up and spitting out artists he feels are being dishonest with themselves. But he is the most honest musician I have ever known. If he agrees, it will be the hardest and best thing that ever happens to your music.”

A car, as sleek and black as the one from the finale night, pulled up to the curb. Kai’s driver. He placed a hand briefly on Zola’s shoulder. “You did the hard part today. You didn’t flinch. Keep doing that.” With a nod to Thandi, he slid into the back of the car and was gone, absorbed back into a world of quiet influence and immense gravity. Zola and Thandi were left standing on the corner, the traffic roaring past them. For a moment, they were just two girls from Observatory, blinking in the bright, expensive sunlight of the Foreshore. Then Thandi let out a whoop of pure, unrestrained joy that made a passing tourist jump. “’You’re an idiot, Marcus!’” she shrieked, mimicking Kai’s quiet, devastating delivery. “Oh my god, I want to get that printed on a t-shirt! I want to tattoo it on my soul! He dismantled him! He took him apart like a piece of flat-pack furniture!”

They didn’t take an Uber home. They walked, their feet carrying them away from the glass towers and towards the sea. They ended up on the Sea Point promenade, the endless blue of the Atlantic on one side and the sprawling mass of the city on the other. This victory felt different from the one on television. That had been a confetti-soaked dream, a surreal public coronation. This was a quiet, brutal battle fought and won in a sterile boardroom. It was a victory not just for her talent, but for her truth, for the very soul of the music she had been so afraid she would have to compromise. "He called them funeral dirges," Zola said, a slow smile spreading across her face as she looked out at the water. "He listened to songs born of that," she gestured to the ocean, "and all he heard was a bad investment." Thandi slung an arm around her shoulders. "And Kai heard a masterpiece. And David Linde is about to hear it. Whose opinion do you think matters more?"

The days that followed were a new kind of purgatory. The waiting was no longer a passive, hopeful state; it was an active, nerve-shredding anticipation. The stakes had been raised to a level she had never imagined. One of the greatest producers alive was going to listen to her raw, intimate recordings, the ones layered with the hiss of wind and the screech of gulls. Zola found she couldn't write. The quiet cottage in Paternoster felt a million miles away. Every time she picked up Nomvula, she imagined a pair of legendary ears listening, judging. Was the chord progression too simple? Was the lyric too sentimental? The freedom she had found by the sea was now being tested by the very real prospect of collaborating with genius. She spent hours walking the familiar streets of her neighbourhood, her phone a heavy weight in her pocket, half-terrified it would ring, half-terrified it wouldn’t.

A week after the boardroom showdown, an email arrived. It was from a sleek, minimalist address belonging to Kai’s management company. The body of the email contained only two sentences. *The files were delivered to Mr. Linde’s studio outside Johannesburg. His office has confirmed receipt.* Zola read the words a dozen times. It was real. Her voice, her guitar, and the Paternoster wind were now sitting on a hard drive in a place she couldn’t even picture, waiting. The confirmation, meant to be a simple logistical update, felt like a starter pistol for a race she wasn’t sure she was ready to run. Every subsequent day was measured by the silence from Johannesburg. Thandi tried to distract her with bad movies and cheap wine, but Zola was distant, her consciousness tethered to an unknown studio hundreds of kilometres away. She was living in the space between sending a message and seeing the three small dots that signal a reply.

Ten days after the email, on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, her phone rang. The number was unlisted, the area code for Johannesburg. Zola’s heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic, panicked bird. She stared at the screen, her thumb hovering over the green icon, a wave of nausea washing over her. This was it. She could let it go to voicemail, retreat into the safety of not knowing for a few more minutes, a few more hours. But Kai’s voice echoed in her memory: *You didn’t flinch.* She took a shaky breath and answered, her voice a reedy whisper. "Hello?" The line was silent for a beat, filled only with a faint, analogue crackle. Then a voice spoke, low and gruff, with a gravelly texture that sounded like it had been aged in whiskey and smoke. "Is this Zola Nkosi?"

"Yes," she breathed. "Speaking."

Another pause. "David Linde here," the voice said, without a hint of ceremony. "I listened to the songs. The ones with the birds on them." Zola’s throat closed. She couldn't speak. She could only listen, her entire future hanging on the next words. The gruff voice continued, as impatient and practical as a mechanic diagnosing a faulty engine. "They're honest. That's rare. The rest we can work on. When can you get to Johannesburg?"The question was not an invitation; it was a summons, a logistical imperative that sliced through the fog of Zola’s shock and landed with the blunt force of a dropped stone. “When can you get to Johannesburg?” For a moment, Zola’s mind was a white-hot blank. Time and space dissolved. She was a disembodied voice connected by a crackling line to a legend, and he was asking her for a date. Her brain, scrambling for a response, could only offer up useless fragments. *Tomorrow? Next year? Never?* The silence stretched, and she could feel an immense, geological impatience building on the other end of the line. She had to say something. Anything.

“Soon,” she managed to whisper, the word a pathetic puff of air. “I can be there soon.” A long, weary sigh travelled down the line from Johannesburg, a sound freighted with the accumulated frustration of dealing with flaky, unprepared artists. “Soon is not a day of the week, Ms. Nkosi,” the gravelly voice returned, the honorific sounding more like an accusation than a mark of respect. “My assistant, Lena, will email you flight details. Your flight is for Friday morning. A car will meet you at the airport. Be ready to work.” Before Zola could form another syllable, there was a decisive click, and the line went dead. The silence that rushed back in was profound, broken only by the frantic, panicked drumming of her own heart. She stood frozen in the middle of her small living room, the phone still pressed to her ear as if it might offer some further explanation. It did not.

Slowly, she lowered the phone, her hand trembling. The reality of the conversation began to seep into her, cold and terrifying and exhilarating all at once. David Linde. He had listened. He had called. Friday morning. Johannesburg. A car. The words were a string of stark, unadorned facts that represented a tectonic shift in her existence. She stumbled to the sofa and sank into its familiar sag, her legs suddenly unable to support her. Her first coherent thought was not of music or art or fame; it was a sudden, desperate need for Thandi. Her fingers fumbled as she dialled, the screen blurring in front of her eyes. Thandi answered on the second ring, her voice a cheerful, mid-afternoon lilt. “Hey, Zee, what’s up? I’m trying to decide if it’s unethical to eat a whole tub of ice cream for lunch.” Zola opened her mouth to speak, but the only sound that came out was a strangled, half-laughing, half-sobbing gasp.

“Zola? What is it? What’s wrong?” Thandi’s voice sharpened instantly, all traces of levity gone. “David Linde,” Zola finally choked out, the name itself a whole story. “He called.” There was a beat of stunned silence on the other end. “He… what?” “He called me, T. He said the songs were honest. He told me to come to Johannesburg. On Friday. He’s sending a car.” Thandi’s response was not a word, but a sound – a high-pitched, explosive shriek of pure, vicarious triumph that was so loud Zola had to pull the phone away from her ear. “HE WHAT? THE GHOST KING CALLED? AND HE’S SUMMONING YOU TO HIS MOUNTAIN LAIR? ZOLA! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! YOU’RE GOING TO JO’BURG! FRIDAY? As in, the day after tomorrow?” Thandi’s questions tumbled over each other, a breathless cascade of shock and elation. The sheer, unadulterated joy in her friend’s voice was the first thing that began to cut through Zola’s own terror, allowing a tiny, fragile spark of excitement to ignite.

The next forty-eight hours were a frantic blur of preparation and barely suppressed panic. Thandi descended upon the flat like a whirlwind, taking charge with military efficiency. While Zola sat numbly on her sofa, staring into the middle distance, Thandi booked flights, pulled clothes from Zola’s wardrobe, and compiled a packing list. The conversation was a one-sided stream of consciousness. “Okay, you need sweaters. It gets cold in Jo’burg at night. And jeans. Nothing too fancy, he’ll think you’re a fraud. But not too scruffy, he’ll think you’re a slob. Oh God, what does one wear to meet a reclusive genius? It’s a sartorial nightmare!” The 'Starlight Search' trophy, still sitting on the bookshelf, seemed to mock her. That journey, with its predictable stages and clear finish line, had been a game. This felt like stepping off a cliff in the dark, armed only with a guitar and a handful of sad songs about the sea. The fear was a cold, heavy presence in her gut. She was leaving her home, her city, her only real friend, to go and work with a man whose reputation for artistic intolerance was as legendary as his production skills. What if he hated her? What if he decided she was a fraud after all? What if she opened her mouth to sing and nothing came out?

On Thursday night, her last night in Cape Town, the reality of her departure finally settled in. The flat was quiet, her bags packed and standing by the door like solemn sentinels. Thandi had made them pasta, and they ate in near silence, the enormity of the moment too big for small talk. After they ate, Thandi looked at Zola, her expression uncharacteristically serious. “Are you scared?” she asked softly. Zola nodded, unable to speak past the lump in her throat. “Good,” Thandi said, her voice firm. “You should be. It means you understand what’s at stake. It means you’re taking it seriously. Just… don’t let the fear be the loudest voice in the room, okay? Your voice is louder. Remember that.” Later, as Zola lay in her bed, listening to the familiar sounds of the city outside her window, she clung to those words. *Your voice is louder.*

The flight to Johannesburg was like ascending into another atmosphere. As the plane banked, Zola looked out the window and saw Table Mountain, its flat top shrouded in a veil of cloud, looking solid, ancient, and achingly far away. It was the anchor of her world, and she was cutting the rope. An hour and a half later, she was descending into a different landscape entirely: a vast, sprawling grid of red-roofed suburbs, mine dumps like man-made mesas, and a dense, high-rise city centre that pulsed with a visible, kinetic energy. The air that hit her as she stepped out of the terminal was different, too – drier, thinner, charged with the smell of dust and industry and the unmistakable electricity of commerce. A man in a dark suit holding a small, discreet sign that simply said ‘Nkosi’ met her at the arrivals hall. He didn’t speak, just nodded, took her bags, and led her to a waiting black sedan. The silence in the car was absolute as they sped down the highway, the city flashing past in a blur of concrete and glass.

The car turned off the main highway and began to climb into the rolling hills north of the city. The landscape changed again, the dense suburbs giving way to large properties hidden behind high walls and lush, established gardens. They drove for what felt like an eternity down a long, winding dirt road before pulling up to a large, unassuming wooden gate. The gate swung open silently, and the car proceeded down a gravel driveway lined with towering, ancient jacaranda trees. It was not a modern architectural statement or a high-tech compound. It was an old Transvaal farmhouse, a long, low building of stone and corrugated iron, with a wide, shaded stoep that ran its entire length. It looked less like a world-famous recording studio and more like a place where someone’s grandmother might live. The car stopped, and the driver opened her door. For a moment, Zola just sat there, her hand gripping the strap of Nomvula’s case. Then, taking a deep breath, she stepped out into the strange, quiet beauty of her new reality.

The air was still and warm, filled with the scent of dry grass and blooming jasmine. The front door of the farmhouse opened, and a man stepped out onto the stoep. He was older than she had pictured, perhaps in his late sixties, with a shock of unruly grey hair and a face etched with deep lines. He wore a rumpled linen shirt and faded jeans, and his feet were bare. He held a steaming mug in one hand, and his eyes, a piercing, intelligent blue, seemed to take in her entire existence in a single, sweeping glance. He did not smile. He did not say hello or welcome. He just stood there, watching her approach. Zola’s heart hammered against her ribs. She walked up the stone steps, her boots loud in the profound silence. He took a slow sip from his mug, his gaze unwavering. Then, he nodded curtly towards the dark, open doorway behind him. "You're late," David Linde said, his voice the same gravelly rasp from the phone. "Let's hear the songs again. Without the damn birds this time."The word ‘late’ hung in the air, an immediate and deliberate off-balancing. Zola felt a flush of heat rise in her cheeks, a defensive protest forming on her lips—her flight had landed on time, the driver was waiting—but she swallowed it down. Arguing logistics with this man felt like telling a mountain it was blocking your view. It was pointless. The only thing to do was walk forward. She followed him through the dark doorway, her eyes struggling to adjust after the bright Highveld sun. She stepped from the world of deadlines and schedules into a space that seemed to exist outside of time. It was the main room of the farmhouse, a vast, double-volume space with a cathedral ceiling crisscrossed by thick, dark wooden beams. The air smelled of old wood, ozone from the electronics, and something faintly spicy, like burning incense. It was a musician’s fever dream.

A colossal vintage mixing console, a constellation of knobs, faders, and VU meters that glowed with a warm, amber light, dominated one wall. It looked less like a piece of equipment and more like an altar. Shelves overflowed with vinyl records, their spines a chaotic tapestry of names and eras. Instruments were scattered everywhere with a kind of reverent carelessness: a stand of battle-scarred electric guitars stood sentinel in one corner, a cello leaned against a bookshelf, its bow dangling from its scroll, and a majestic Hammond B3 organ sat shrouded in a dusty velvet cloth. It was not a sterile, soundproofed studio; it was a living room, a library, a museum, and a workshop, all dedicated to the singular pursuit of capturing sound. It was the most intimidating place Zola had ever been.

David Linde didn't offer her a seat or ask if she wanted water. He walked to the centre of the room, to a worn, threadbare Persian rug, and pointed to a simple, straight-backed wooden chair that sat upon it. "There," he said. Then he turned, walked back to the command-centre chair behind the mixing desk, and sat down, his bare feet propped up on a low stool. He folded his arms, his piercing blue eyes fixed on her, and waited. The silence was an active, crushing pressure. This was the test. There were no pleasantries, no settling in. Just the chair, the rug, and the unwavering gaze of the man who held her future in his hands. Zola’s heart was a frantic drum against her ribs. She took a slow, deliberate breath, walked to the chair, and gently unlatched Nomvula’s case. The familiar click of the latches was a small, reassuring sound in the vast silence. She lifted the guitar, its familiar weight a grounding force. She sat, adjusted the guitar on her lap, and took a moment to tune the strings, the simple, methodical act a ritual to calm her shaking hands.

She knew what she had to play. ‘Tide Song’. He had asked to hear it without the birds, which meant he wanted to know if the song could stand on its own, stripped of its evocative, atmospheric crutch. He wanted to know if the magic was in the recording or in the writing. She closed her eyes, shutting out the intimidating room and the man watching her from the shadows. She pictured the stoep of the Paternoster cottage, the feel of the cold, salty wind on her face, the endless grey horizon of the Atlantic. She was not in Johannesburg. She was back on the West Coast, alone with her thoughts. She took a breath that tasted of salt and memory and began to play. The chords filled the acoustically rich room, each note hanging in the air, clean and distinct. Her voice, when it came, was stripped of all affectation, a quiet, conversational tone that held a deep well of emotion just beneath the surface. She wasn't performing; she was testifying, bearing witness to the simple truth she had discovered in her solitude.

She sang the song from beginning to end, letting the final, simple chord resonate until it faded into nothing. The silence that followed was absolute, deeper and more profound than it had been before. It felt like the air after a lightning strike, charged and expectant. Zola kept her head down, her fingers resting lightly on the strings, not daring to look up, not daring to breathe. She waited for the verdict. Finally, David Linde’s voice cut through the stillness, and the words he chose were a quiet, brutal demolition. "It's a pretty song," he said, and the adjective, from his lips, was a blade. "Sentimental. You fell in love with a metaphor, and you forgot to tell the truth."

Zola’s head snapped up, a protest forming on her lips. The song was the truest thing she had ever written. Linde stood up and walked slowly towards her, his bare feet silent on the wooden floorboards. He stopped in front of her, looking down not at her, but at her guitar. "The ocean doesn't have feelings, Ms. Nkosi. It doesn't offer acceptance or solace. It's a billion tons of saltwater, driven by lunar gravity and atmospheric pressure. It's a blind, indifferent force that will kill you as easily as it will lull you to sleep. You've projected your own emotional journey onto it and dressed it up in nice chords." He crouched down, his gaze intense. "I'm not interested in your feelings. They're yours, they're temporary, and frankly, they're boring. I'm interested in the truth of the thing itself. The weight of the water. The violence of the tide against the rock. The salt that corrodes steel. You wrote a postcard from your holiday. I need a core sample. I need the geology. What's underneath the pretty sand? What's the bedrock? Dig deeper."

The critique was so fundamental, so dismissive of the very thing she was most proud of, that it left her breathless. It felt cruel, but beneath the cruelty, she sensed the sharp, cold edge of an uncomfortable truth. She had written about how the ocean had made her *feel*, not about the ocean itself. A woman appeared silently in the doorway, her presence a quiet interruption. She was in her forties, with a calm, capable face and her hair tied back in a neat bun. "Lena," Linde said, straightening up, his audience with Zola apparently over. "Show Ms. Nkosi to the cottage. We start again tomorrow at nine. Bring a shovel." Without another word, he turned his back on her and returned to his throne behind the mixing desk, already lost in whatever world existed between his ears.

Lena offered Zola a small, kind smile that was a balm on her flayed nerves. "Don't mind him," she whispered as she led Zola out of the main room and into the warm afternoon sun. "His bark is his whole personality. Come, I'll show you where you're staying." She led Zola down a stone path to a small, separate cottage tucked away under a massive jacaranda tree. It was a single room, monastic in its simplicity, with a bed, a small wooden desk, and a window that looked out over the dry, rolling hills. It was clean, quiet, and utterly devoid of charm. "The kitchen in the main house is always open," Lena explained, placing Zola’s bags on the floor. "And a word of advice. David doesn't tear down things he thinks are beyond repair. He only puts in the effort if he believes there's something strong enough to rebuild. What he did in there… that was a compliment."

Lena left, and Zola was alone in the silent, unfamiliar room. The window framed a landscape that was alien to her: the pale, straw-coloured grass of the Highveld winter, the spiky silhouette of an aloe plant, the vast, pale blue sky. She felt like she had been dismantled, her core beliefs about her own songwriting broken down into their constituent parts and found wanting. The sting of his words—*sentimental, pretty, boring*—was sharp and humiliating. But Lena's words echoed, a counter-melody of hope. *Something strong enough to rebuild.* He had not sent her away. He had told her to come back tomorrow. He had told her to dig. She looked at Nomvula, leaning against the wall, its familiar curves a comfort in the strange new room. The journey she had thought was about polishing her songs was, she now realised, about breaking them open entirely. The work hadn't just begun. She had to start all over again.### Chapter 9

That first night in the Johannesburg cottage was the longest of Zola’s life. The Highveld silence was a different beast to the coastal quiet she had sought out. The Paternoster silence had been full of the ocean’s constant, rhythmic breathing, a sound that held her. This was a thin, high-altitude silence, sharp and empty, offering no comfort. Every rustle of the dry leaves outside her window, every distant bark of a dog, was an intrusion that only amplified her profound isolation. She lay on the narrow bed, the unfamiliar sheets cool against her skin, and stared into the darkness, Linde’s words playing on a merciless loop in her mind. *Pretty. Sentimental. Boring.* The critique was a masterclass in psychological demolition. He hadn't just disliked the song; he had invalidated its very premise, dismissed the emotional journey that had felt so monumental as a self-indulgent holiday romance. The validation she had received from Thandi, from Kai, from the weeping mother of a teenage fan—it all dissolved under the acid of his judgment. It felt like she had proudly presented a diamond, only to be told it was a worthless piece of glass.

A surge of hot, defensive anger coursed through her. Who was he, this bitter old man in his dusty farmhouse, to tell her what her truth was? She had lived that song. She had felt that solace. She sat up, switching on the small bedside lamp, its weak yellow light a feeble challenge to the immense darkness outside. She grabbed her notebook, flipping to the clean, confident transcription of 'Tide Song', and her anger faltered. Under the harsh glare of Linde’s critique, the words now seemed to blush on the page. Lines that had felt profound now read like platitudes. The "I" was everywhere, a needy, central character demanding attention. *I learned to stand, I learned to be, the ocean taught me…* He was right. It was a song about her, using the ocean as a pretty, passive backdrop. The anger collapsed into a cold, hollowing shame. The shovel he had told her to bring felt impossibly heavy, and she had no idea where to even begin digging.

The walk to the main house at precisely nine o'clock the next morning was a walk of shame. Zola felt like a student called to the principal’s office, unprepared for an exam she didn’t understand. She had spent hours the previous night trying to rewrite the song, clumsily inserting "harsher" words. She had replaced ‘gentle’ with ‘brutal’, ‘whisper’ with ‘roar’. She knew, even as she did it, that it was a superficial fix, like putting a leather jacket on a librarian and calling her a rebel. But it was all she had. The studio was filled with the warm, rich sound of a vintage Nina Simone record playing at a low volume. Linde was at the mixing desk, a schematic diagram spread out before him, a soldering iron in his hand. He looked up as she entered, his eyes giving nothing away. He gestured with his head towards the wooden chair on the rug. The unspoken command was clear.

Zola sat, her hands slick with a nervous sweat. She cleared her throat and began to play her mangled new version of the song. “The brutal tide, a crushing sound…” she began, her voice straining with a forced intensity. She didn’t get past the second line. Linde held up a hand, the soldering iron still clutched in it like a weapon. The music stopped. “Stop,” he said, his voice flat with disappointment. “Don’t waste my time. You think digging deeper means choosing more dramatic adjectives? That’s not writing, that’s decorating. You’re painting the surface of the rock a darker colour. I told you to show me the rock.” He turned back to his schematic, his attention already withdrawn, the dismissal absolute. “Come back when you have something to say that isn’t a performance of what you think I want to hear.” The humiliation was a physical blow. She felt her throat tighten, tears of frustration stinging her eyes. She wanted to run, to pack her bags and flee back to the safety of Cape Town, back to Thandi’s uncomplicated belief in her. But she was trapped, held in place by a sliver of pride and the terrifying thought that he might just be right. She stood up, mumbled a defeated “okay,” and retreated to her cottage, the sound of Nina Simone’s powerful, achingly honest voice following her out the door.

She spent the rest of the day in a state of suspended despair. She didn’t touch her guitar. She paced the small room, stared out the window at the unblinking sun, and felt the four weeks the label had given her stretching into an impossible, empty eternity. She was a fraud. A one-hit wonder from a talent show whose one hit hadn’t even been her own idea. She had built her identity on being an ‘honest’ songwriter, and the first true test had exposed her as a sentimental amateur. She lay on her bed, her arm thrown over her eyes, and considered the exquisite mortification of calling Thandi and admitting defeat. It was in that moment of absolute surrender, when she had given up even trying to be a songwriter, that she truly saw the aloe plant outside her window for the first time. She had glanced at it a dozen times, but now she *saw* it. She saw the thick, waxy texture of its leaves, designed to prevent water from escaping. She saw the vicious, sharp spines along its edges, a clear, unambiguous warning. She saw the fine layer of red dust that coated its grey-green skin. It wasn't a symbol of resilience; it was a machine for survival, a physical manifestation of a thousand brutal adaptations.

Linde’s words echoed in her head: *The truth of the thing itself.* Getting up from the bed, she picked up her notebook, but not her guitar. She walked outside and sat on the dusty ground in front of the aloe. For the next hour, she did not try to write a song. She simply described the plant, filling the page with a forensic, almost scientific list of observations. *Leaves are serrated, like a bread knife. A sticky, clear gel inside. The base is thick, woody. It looks thirsty. It looks armed.* The exercise was grounding, a relief from the pressure of her own feelings. It was an act of pure observation. When she finished, she read the list back. It was not a poem. It was not a song. But it was true. And it contained more emotion, more story, in its stark details than all her previous attempts at describing her feelings about it.

That was the shovel. The realization hit her with the force of a revelation. She had been trying to dig with her emotions, a flimsy, unreliable tool. The real work was in observation, in bearing witness to the world outside herself. She went back inside, her mind racing. She didn’t pick up her guitar. She sat on the floor, closed her eyes, and forced herself back to the beach at Paternoster. She ignored the feelings of peace and solitude. Instead, she focused on the physical sensations. The piercing cold of the water that numbed her ankles. The grating sound of shell fragments being dragged back and forth by the surf, a constant, grinding erosion. The smell of low tide, a pungent mix of salt and decay. The way the relentless wind had pushed so hard against her she had to lean into it just to stay upright. These were not metaphors. They were facts.

With a new, fierce clarity, she began to rewrite 'Tide Song' from the ground up. She eviscerated the old lyrics, crossing them out with a thick, satisfying black line. The ‘I’ vanished from the first verse, replaced by a litany of stark, sensory details. *A granite stone, worn to a curve / The iron wreck, a rusted nerve / The kelp lies drying on the sand / A dead seal’s bones half-buried in the land.* The rhymes were secondary, the rhythm dictated by the images themselves. The song was no longer a mirror reflecting her feelings. It was a window, looking out onto a scene that was both beautiful and brutal, a place of profound indifference that held its own terrible, magnificent truth. She worked for hours, the sun sinking below the horizon, her handwriting a frantic, energized scrawl across the page.

Late that evening, she walked back to the main house. The studio was dark, save for the amber glow of the console and a single lamp over Linde’s desk. He was reading, a tumbler of what looked like whiskey by his elbow. She knew she was breaking the rules by coming back unsummoned, but she didn’t care. She was not there to ask for his approval. She was there to show him the work. She walked to the centre of the Persian rug and stood there, waiting. He looked up from his book, his expression unreadable in the dim light. He said nothing, just watched her. She didn’t ask permission. She sat in the wooden chair, picked up the house acoustic guitar that was always left there, and began to play the new song. She sang the first verse, her voice quiet, unadorned, letting the starkness of the images do the work.

When she finished the verse, she stopped. The final chord hung in the dark, quiet room. She looked at him, her heart beating a slow, steady rhythm, no longer afraid. Linde stared back at her for a long, unblinking moment. Then, he slowly stood up, walked over to a large, dusty whiteboard on the far wall, and picked up a black marker. In clean, block letters, he wrote the words ‘TIDE SONG’ at the very top. He stepped back, looked at the words, and then at her. He still did not smile, but the piercing blue of his eyes had lost its dismissive edge. It now held a flicker of something else, something that looked almost like respect. "Alright," he said, his voice a low gravelly rumble. "Now we have a foundation. Tomorrow, you bring me the bedrock for the rest of them."The walk back to her cottage was through a world transformed. The pale, dry grass was no longer alien; it was a specific colour, a texture. The chirping of unseen insects in the twilight was not just noise; it was a rhythm, a key signature. Linde had not given her a compliment, he had given her a lens. He had handed her a tool that scraped away the cataracts of her own self-involvement and allowed her to see the world with a stark, terrifying, and exhilarating clarity. She felt exhausted, hollowed out, but it was the clean, satisfying ache of a hard day's labour, not the gnawing emptiness of despair. She slept that night without dreaming, a deep, restorative plunge into blackness.

The rhythm of her life in the compound quickly established itself, governed by an unspoken, monastic code. The days were long, the work was brutal, and the rewards were sparse and profound. Zola learned that the nine o’clock start was not a suggestion. It was a deadline. She would spend her mornings in her small cottage, not just practicing, but dissecting. She would take one of the songs she had brought from Paternoster, pin it to the wall like a butterfly in a specimen box, and begin the ruthless process of stripping it down to its bones. She applied Linde’s lesson with the zeal of a convert. Her song about the resilient milkwood trees, once a gentle metaphor for her own survival, became a study in botanical warfare. She abandoned the lines about her own struggles and instead wrote about the physics of the wind, the chemistry of the salt spray that cauterized the leaves, the slow, violent twisting of the trunk as it fought for a sliver of sunlight.

When she presented this new version to Linde, he listened with his eyes closed, his face impassive. When she finished, he didn't speak for a full minute. "Better," he said finally. "But you're still describing it from the outside. You're a tourist. What does it feel like to be that tree? Not emotionally. Physically. The strain in the wood fibers. The constant thirst in the roots. Get inside it." He then stood up, walked over to his vast record collection, and pulled out a vinyl record. It was a dusty copy of a John Lee Hooker album. He placed it on the turntable, and a raw, guttural, one-chord blues stomped out of the speakers, the sound of a man who seemed to be channeling the mud of the Mississippi Delta directly through his guitar. Linde didn't say a word. He just let the music fill the room, a raw, elemental lesson in embodiment. Zola understood. Hooker wasn't singing *about* the blues; he was the blues.

It took her two more days of rewriting, of pushing past description into a kind of visceral empathy, before she brought the song back to him. This time, when she sang of the twisted wood, her voice had a new grain, a tension that mirrored the strain in the tree’s limbs. When she finished, Linde listened to the final chord decay into silence, gave a single, curt nod, and walked to the whiteboard. Without a word, he picked up the marker and wrote ‘MILKWOOD’ in his clean, block capitals beneath ‘TIDE SONG’. Zola felt a thrill so sharp and pure it was almost painful. It was not praise. It was proof of progress. It was a foundation stone laid.

So it went, for weeks. One by one, she brought her coastal songs to be demolished and rebuilt. Her wry, character-driven song about the fisherman became a stark, rhythmic work song, its pulse mirroring the pull of the nets, its lyrics stripped down to the facts of his labour: the smell of diesel, the ache in his shoulders, the price of fish at the market. Linde added ‘FISHERMAN’S BLUES’ to the board. Her atmospheric piece about the foghorn was the hardest. He made her research the actual mechanics of the device, the Kelvin-Hughes compressed-air system, forcing her to find the poetry not in the mournful sound, but in the engineering, in the cold, mechanical reality of a signal designed to cut through blindness. ‘FOGHORN’ joined the others on the growing list. The whiteboard became her catechism, the visible record of her brutal education.

One evening, she called Thandi, huddling in a corner of her cottage where the signal was strongest. She tried to explain the process. "He told me my song about the fisherman was a cartoon and that I needed to understand the economics of the West Coast fishing industry before I could write another line." There was a stunned silence on the other end, followed by Thandi’s incredulous laugh. "Is he producing your album or putting you through a PhD program? The man is certifiably insane." "I know," Zola said, a small smile playing on her lips. "But he’s not wrong, T. My songs were thin. They were about me. Now… now they feel like they have weight. They feel like they’re made of something real." "As long as he’s not making you eat rocks to understand geology, I guess it’s fine," Thandi conceded. "Just… be careful, Zee. Don’t let him break you." "He’s already broken me," Zola replied, the words holding no trace of self-pity. "He broke me open. There’s a difference."

After she had rebuilt the last of the Paternoster songs, a new kind of silence descended. The whiteboard was full, a testament to the work they had done. But the next step was unspoken, and terrifying. Could she create something new here, from scratch, using this rigorous, unsentimental method? The pressure was immense. She felt emptied out, all her old ideas dismantled. For days, she felt nothing but a dry, dusty silence in her creative mind. There was no ocean to observe, no comforting, familiar landscape to draw from. There was only the strange, sharp beauty of the Highveld and the oppressive genius in the main house. She felt like a fraud all over again, a student who had learned to pass the exams but had no original thoughts of her own.

The breakthrough, when it came, was quiet. She was sitting on her small stoep one evening as a thunderstorm rolled in across the plains. The sky turned a bruised, dramatic purple, and the first fat drops of rain began to fall, kicking up the petrichor scent of red dust. The rain hit the tin roof of her cottage not with a soft patter, but with a hard, percussive, almost metallic rattle. It was an aggressive sound, energetic and alive. It was the sound of Johannesburg. She thought of the city’s frantic energy, its sharp edges, its mix of raw ambition and deep-seated history. She thought of the red dust that got into everything, a constant reminder of the gold mines that had given the city its birth and its brutal, complex soul. A new melody began to form in her head, not the gentle, cyclical tune of the ocean, but something more angular, syncopated, with a nervous, urgent rhythm.

The next day, she brought the fragile, half-formed idea to Linde. She was more nervous than she had been on the very first day. This was not a song she had brought with her. This was a song born of this place, of his process. She sat in the chair and played what she had, a single verse and a chorus, the lyrics speaking of "red dust in the throat" and "a sky the colour of a bruise." When she finished, the studio was silent. Linde did not go to the whiteboard. He did not speak. Instead, he slowly stood up, walked to a corner of the room where a magnificent, honey-coloured upright bass was leaning against a stack of amplifiers, and lifted the heavy instrument into his arms. He stood opposite her, his fingers finding their place on the thick strings. "Play it again," he commanded, his voice a low rumble. Zola’s heart leaped into her throat. She began the song again, her fingers finding the chords. And then it happened. David Linde began to play. A low, resonant, perfectly placed bassline emerged, a simple two-note pattern that locked into the rhythm of her guitar and gave her angular melody a deep, resonant heartbeat. It was not a critique. It was not a lesson. For the first time, it was a conversation. The two of them, master and apprentice, stood in the center of the vast, quiet room and made music together, the sound of the Johannesburg storm finding its voice.## Chapter 10

The last resonant note from the upright bass seemed to hang in the vast, wooden room for an eternity, a deep, foundational hum that Zola felt in her bones. She remained frozen in the chair, her fingers still pressed to the fretboard, her breath caught in her throat. She had played music with other people before, in clumsy open mic night jams and forced collaborations, but this was different. This was not two instruments playing at the same time; it was a conversation, a locking of gears. His simple, perfectly placed bassline had not just accompanied her; it had illuminated her melody, given it a foundation, a sense of gravity she didn’t know it was missing. For the first time, she had not just been heard; she had been answered. The moment was so charged with creative intimacy it felt more revealing than any verbal praise could ever be.

David Linde lowered the heavy instrument, leaning it against the amplifier with a quiet thud. He did not look at her. He did not acknowledge the profound shift that had just occurred between them. He simply walked to the whiteboard, his bare feet silent on the floorboards, and uncapped the black marker. In his clean, steady hand, he wrote ‘RED DUST’ underneath the list of her rebuilt coastal songs. Then he stepped back, looked at the title for a moment, and turned to her. His face was as impassive as ever, but the silence he left in place of a critique was the most eloquent statement he had ever made. He had joined in. The song was worthy. The foundation had been laid not just for the song, but for a new way of working.

The very next morning, the dynamic in the studio was irrevocably altered. When Zola entered at nine, Linde was not waiting for her in judgment. He was hunched over the mixing desk, listening to a rough recording of their impromptu jam from the night before, the sound of her guitar and his bass pulsing quietly from the large studio monitors. He gestured for her to come over, a summons not to the chair of judgment, but to the console of creation. “Listen,” he commanded, pointing a long, thin finger at the speakers. “Hear that space? Right after your fourth beat, before my first. That’s the pocket. That’s where the groove lives. Your rhythm is instinctive, but it’s wild. Today, we tame it. Not by caging it. By teaching it where the fences are.” For the rest of the morning, he did not ask her to sing a single word. Instead, they focused solely on the rhythm of ‘Red Dust’. He had her play the main guitar riff over and over, while he tapped out complex polyrhythms on the body of an acoustic guitar or on the edge of the console, forcing her to hold her own pattern steady against his, to feel the push and pull of syncopation not as a concept, but as a physical force.

This became the new template for their days. The process was no longer about demolition. It was about construction. Zola would bring the fragile skeleton of a new idea, born of the Highveld landscape, and Linde would help her find its flesh and blood. He was no longer just a critic; he was a producer in the truest sense of the word, a sonic midwife. He would listen to a new melody and respond not with words, but with sound. He would pull a dusty Wurlitzer electric piano from a corner and show her how its warm, mournful tone could add a new layer of texture. He had her spend an entire afternoon listening to nothing but the drum breaks on old Stax records, to understand how a snare drum could speak with a human voice. He was giving her more than just feedback; he was giving her a vocabulary, a palette of sounds and ideas that expanded her own musical universe at a terrifying, exhilarating rate.

During this intense period, Lena, his quiet, capable assistant, became a silent source of support for Zola. She would appear with a mug of strong tea at just the right moment, after Linde had dismissed a morning’s work with a single, devastating grunt. One afternoon, as Zola sat dejectedly on the stoep, wrestling with a new song that refused to take shape, Lena sat down beside her. “You know,” she said, her voice soft, “when Kai was here for his first record, David made him rewrite the lyrics to what became his biggest hit seventeen times. On the sixteenth try, Kai threw a guitar stand across the room and stormed out. He came back the next day, and the seventeenth version was the one. David saw the fire, but he wanted to see if Kai could control the burn.” The anecdote landed exactly as Lena intended, a small piece of scaffolding to shore up Zola’s flagging spirit. She was not alone in this trial by fire. She was part of a lineage.

The call to Thandi that week was like a broadcast from another planet. Zola tried to explain the day’s work. “He had me detune my guitar to an open C minor and play one chord for an hour, just to feel its resonant frequency. He says I think of chords as building blocks, but that I need to think of them as rooms to walk around in.” There was a long pause from Cape Town. “Okay, he’s officially a cult leader,” Thandi said, her voice a mixture of awe and genuine concern. “And you’re his newest disciple. Are you drinking any Kool-Aid? Just tell me you haven’t started walking around barefoot.” Zola looked down at her own feet, bare on the cool stone floor of her cottage. She had started doing it without even noticing. “It’s not like that, T,” she said, a smile in her voice. “He’s not telling me what to write. He’s just… showing me how to listen differently. To everything.” But after the call, Thandi’s words lingered. Was she losing herself? Was her voice, the one she had fought so hard to claim, now just becoming a different, more sophisticated echo of his?

The fear crystallised around the creation of the album’s final track. The whiteboard now held eleven titles, a neat list split between the rebuilt coastal songs and the new Highveld ones. They needed one more to complete the album, a song to tie the two disparate worlds together. For days, Zola came up empty. She felt the pressure to produce a masterpiece, a grand statement that would neatly summarise her entire artistic journey. Every idea felt forced, pretentious. She brought fragments to Linde, and he dismissed them with a wave of his hand, his silence more damning than any insult. "You're trying to write the album's mission statement," he finally said one afternoon, his patience worn thin. "Stop trying to be clever. Stop trying to tell me what the journey means. Just tell me what you see when you close your eyes and think of home. Not as a concept. As a place."

The simple command cut through her creative paralysis. That night, she didn't think about albums or statements. She sat on her bed and thought of the view from her flat in Observatory. She thought of the particular shade of purple the jacaranda trees turned in November. She thought of the way Table Mountain looked different every day, sometimes sharp and clear, other times veiled in its tablecloth of cloud. She thought of the ache of homesickness, not as a grand, poetic sorrow, but as a simple, physical longing for a familiar slant of light, a specific taste of the air. A new song began to emerge, quiet and unadorned. It wasn’t a grand statement. It was a letter home, a small, intimate confession of longing, its melody gentle and direct.

The next day, she played it for him. It was the quietest song on the album, just her and Nomvula, her voice holding a fragile, honest tremble she didn't try to hide. When she finished, the silence in the studio was profound. Linde did not move for a very long time. He stared at a fixed point on the far wall, his expression unreadable. Zola held her breath, her heart a quiet, painful thud. She had laid herself completely bare, with no complex arrangement or clever metaphor to hide behind. Finally, he stood, walked to the whiteboard, and in the last available space at the bottom of the list, he wrote, ‘JACOARANDA’. He stepped back, his eyes scanning the twelve titles, a completed chapter of her life written in his stark, block letters. He turned to face her, and for the first time since she had arrived, the harsh lines around his mouth softened into something that was almost, but not quite, a smile. “Good,” he said, the single word landing with the weight of a benediction. “We have an album. Now the real work begins.”
