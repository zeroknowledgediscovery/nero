The burn began, as it always did, as a low ember in her quads. A familiar, almost comforting, signal that the work was starting. Chloe Ashton leaned further over the handlebars, her spine curving into a question mark, the wind a solid wall she was determined to punch a hole through. The world shrank. Just the tarmac, the hum of the tyre, the metronomic tick of her own heart. She pushed harder, the suburban sprawl of Woking blurring into a watercolour wash of brick and weary green, a landscape she knew so intimately she could navigate it with her eyes closed, tracing the hairline cracks in the pavement and the specific pattern of oil stains outside the kebab shop on Chertsey Road. This wasn't a race. This was a ritual, a pre-dawn confession whispered between her and the sleeping town.

Her bike, Circe, was an extension of her own limbs. A strange, skeletal creature with no brakes and a fixed gear, it was less a mode of transport and more a temperamental dance partner. Every ounce of momentum Chloe generated was a pact; to slow down, she had to resist the forward surge with her own legs, a backward pressure that screamed through her hamstrings. To stop, a miracle of balance and force. But to fly… to fly was to find the perfect cadence, that sweet spot where muscle and machine became one fluid entity, devouring the road.

This morning, the air had a damp, metallic tang that promised rain later but for now was just crisp enough to feel like a whetstone against her cheeks. 4:30 AM. The only other signs of life were the blinking orange lights of a council gritter and the occasional fox, a flash of russet and audacity, streaking across the road. This was her time. Before Woking Wheels Bike Shop, before the endless questions about puncture repair kits and handlebar tape, before the mask of chipper competence she had to wear for eight hours a day. Out here, on Circe, she was just Chloe. A body in motion, a lungful of air, a burning in the legs.

She turned onto the industrial estate loop, her favourite training ground. A three-mile circuit of perfect, soulless tarmac, wide corners, and zero pedestrians. Here, she could open up. Not just speed, but form. She rose from the saddle, her body a rigid plank, and let her left leg trail off the pedal, hovering inches from the spinning spokes. She shifted her weight, a subtle tilt of the hips, and Circe responded, carving a smooth, elegant arc. This was the beginning of the other side of her cycling. The secret side. The side that had nothing to do with A-to-B and everything to do with… something else. Art, maybe. Madness, according to Liam.

Liam. Her friend, her long-suffering housemate, and the only person who had ever seen her truly perform on Circe. He called it her ‘bicycle ballet’. He was probably still dead to the world in their cramped flat above the laundrette, dreaming of gear ratios and artisanal coffee. It was Liam’s fault she was in this mess. This glorious, terrifying, utterly ludicrous mess.

It had started, as most of their terrible ideas did, over a greasy takeaway pizza and a flickering television screen. They were watching ‘Britain’s Best’, the nation’s Saturday night obsession. A parade of shimmering, desperate hope. A ten-year-old with the voice of a forty-year-old diva had just brought the house down.
“Sob story,” Liam had mumbled through a mouthful of pepperoni, gesturing at the screen with a crust. “Always a sob story. Sings for his dear departed hamster. You can’t compete with a dead hamster, Chloe. It’s the rules.”

Chloe had snorted. “It’s not the hamster, it’s the manipulation. Look at them. Crying on cue.” She gestured at the judging panel, a triptych of celebrity archetypes: the hanging judge, Sir Reginald Pike, whose face looked permanently affixed in a state of smelling something foul; the effervescent pop starlet, Krystal, who cried at everything; and the ‘serious’ one, a West End choreographer named Anton.

“You could do it,” Liam had said, suddenly serious. His eyes, usually crinkled with easy laughter, had a focused glint.
“Do what? Cry over a dead rodent?”
“No. The show. You, and Circe. You’re better than half these clowns.”
Chloe had laughed, a real, full-throated laugh that made their precarious stacks of cycling magazines vibrate. “Don’t be an idiot. They want singers. Dancers with tragic backstories. Not some girl from Woking doing handstands on a pushbike.”
“It’s not a pushbike, it’s a highly specialised piece of athletic equipment,” he’d retorted, slipping into his bike-nerd voice. “And it’s not just handstands. It’s… poetry. They’ve never seen anything like it. Sir Reginald would have a conniption. It’d be brilliant television.”
“No.”
“I dare you.”
“Absolutely not.”
“Chicken.”
“I’m not a chicken, I’m a realist, Liam.”
“I’ll fill out the application for you. All you have to do is not say no.” He had grabbed his laptop, his fingers already flying across the keyboard with the fervour of a true believer. And Chloe, full of pizza and disdain for reality television, hadn't said no. It was a joke. A stupid, late-night dare.

Except it wasn’t. A month later, an email with the subject line “Your Britain’s Best Audition!” had landed in her inbox like a small, digital grenade. And somehow, propelled by Liam’s relentless optimism and a deep-seated, terrifying flicker of her own curiosity, she had gone. She’d bundled Circe into the back of Liam’s battered Ford Transit, surrounded by old towels like a priceless artefact, and driven into the maw of London.

The holding area for the auditions was a cacophony of nervous energy. Dancers stretched in sequined leotards, their limbs impossibly flexible. A man in a full suit of armour practiced juggling flaming torches in a corner. A barbershop quartet hummed a dissonant chord over and over again. And then there was Chloe, in her simple black leggings and t-shirt, standing next to a bicycle. She felt like an alien, a clerical error. People stared at Circe, then at her, their expressions a mixture of pity and confusion.

“You a courier?” a magician with a glittery waistcoat had asked, trying to make a pigeon disappear up his sleeve and failing.
“Something like that,” Chloe had mumbled, her throat tight.

She’d almost bailed a dozen times. She could just walk out, get back in the van, and be home in Woking in time for a normal afternoon. No one would ever have to know. But then she’d catch Liam’s eye across the crowded room. He’d just give her a small, firm nod. *You’ve got this.* That stupid, unwavering belief of his. It was more binding than any contract.

When they finally called her number, B-472, her heart tried to climb out of her throat. She wheeled Circe through a labyrinth of black curtains and cables, emerging onto a starkly lit stage marked with a giant X. It faced a single camera and a table where three bored-looking producers sat. The cavernous, empty theatre beyond was a black hole. This wasn’t the grand stage from the TV; this was the filter. The cattle market.

“Name?” one of the producers asked, not looking up from his clipboard.
“Chloe Ashton.”
“And your talent?”
She took a breath. “Artistic cycling.”
The producer finally looked up, his eyebrows climbing his forehead. “Sorry, what?”
“It’s… like gymnastics. On a bike.”
He exchanged a look with his colleague. It was a look that said, *Here we go. Another weirdo.* “Right. Off you go then. You have ninety seconds.”

The dismissal in his tone was a spark. It burned away some of the fear, replacing it with a cold, familiar defiance. It was the same feeling she got on a steep hill climb, the voice in her head that said *you can’t*, and the other, deeper voice that replied, *watch me*.

She swung a leg over Circe, the worn leather of the saddle a familiar anchor. She pushed off, completing a slow, deliberate circle around the X. The producers were already starting to write on their clipboards. They’d already made up their minds. Fine. This wasn’t for them. It was for her.

She pedalled faster, building momentum in the small space. Then, in one fluid motion, she swung both legs over the handlebars, her body facing backwards, steering with her hands behind her back. She pedalled in a reverse circle, her eyes fixed on a point in the darkness to keep her balance. She heard one of the clipboards clatter onto the table.

Now.

She stood up, one foot on the saddle, the other on the handlebars, her arms out for balance, a tightrope walker on her own strange apparatus. From there, she pushed up, her hands gripping the handlebars, her legs scissoring into the air until she was holding a perfect, trembling handstand. The world was upside down. The producers’ shocked faces, the stark white X on the floor, the single, blinding spotlight. The only sound was the whisper of the tyre as the back wheel continued to spin beneath her, a tiny, gyroscopic engine keeping her universe stable. She held it. Five seconds. Ten. The burn was in her shoulders now, a roaring fire. With controlled strength, she lowered herself back down, landing softly on the frame, swinging her legs back to the pedals without ever breaking momentum, and coming to a smooth, perfect stop on the X, one foot touching the floor.

Silence. A thick, profound silence that was more shocking than any applause. She was panting, sweat stinging her eyes. She looked at the producers. The man who had spoken to her was staring, his mouth slightly agape. The woman next to him was slowly, deliberately, drawing a large star on her notepad.

“Well,” the first producer said, his voice an octave higher than before. “We’ll be in touch.”

But Chloe knew. She had felt it in the silence. It was the same feeling as cresting a hill into a sudden, stunning view. A feeling of having broken through. Two weeks later, another email. Subject: “Welcome to the Live Shows!” She and Liam had read it ten times, the words blurring into nonsense. Then they’d opened a bottle of cheap prosecco and he’d danced around the tiny living room, chanting “I told you so!” until their downstairs neighbour banged on the ceiling with a broom.

And now, here she was. Not just in the live shows, but through them. The quarter-final, a blur of sequins, smoke machines, and a standing ovation. The semi-final, where she’d performed a routine so complex Liam had claimed he needed a lie-down afterwards, and Sir Reginald Pike had actually cracked a smile. A smile. It was like seeing a statue weep.

The final. She was in the final of ‘Britain’s Best’. It was tomorrow.

Chloe finished her last lap of the industrial estate, her legs now singing with the familiar fire of a workout well done. She began the slow ride home, the sky beginning to blush with the first hints of dawn. The reality of it all crashed into her. Tomorrow night, ten million people would be watching her. Her, Chloe Ashton from Woking. And Circe. She felt a surge of something hot and dizzying in her chest. It wasn't just fear. It was delight. A wild, terrifying, unadulterated delight. She was a cyclist who spent her life tracing the same familiar patterns on the tarmac. Tomorrow, she would be tracing them on a stage for the entire nation. She let out a whoop of laughter into the quiet morning air, a sound that was swallowed instantly by the waking town.The key turning in the lock of their flat was always an absurdly loud sound in the pre-dawn quiet. It felt like a betrayal of the secret she’d just shared with the streets. The flat, perched precariously above ‘Woking Suds’, always carried a faint, clean scent of industrial-strength fabric softener, a smell that had woven itself into the fabric of Chloe’s life. She wheeled Circe inside, her movements practiced and gentle, propping the bike against the wall of the narrow hallway, which was already a Tetris-like puzzle of wheels, frames, and boxes of spare parts. The place was more workshop than home, a testament to their shared obsession.

Liam was already up. The rich, earthy smell of freshly ground coffee, his one true religion, cut through the soapy air. She could hear him moving around their small galley kitchen, the clink of a ceramic mug against the countertop. He appeared in the doorway, a mug in each hand, his hair a mess and his eyes still puffy with sleep, but with that familiar, focused glint already present.
“The final ride before the final ride,” he said, his voice a low rumble. He passed her a mug, the warmth seeping instantly into her cold fingers. “How was she?”

“Fast,” Chloe said, taking a grateful sip. It was perfect, of course. Strong and black. Liam didn't believe in adding things to coffee any more than she believed in adding gears to a bike. “The tarmac on the estate is like glass this morning. Perfect.” She ran a soft cloth along Circe’s top tube, wiping away the fine layer of morning damp. This was part of the ritual too. The cool-down. The debrief.

“Good. Good.” Liam leaned against the doorframe, watching her. “You didn’t… you didn’t try the new dismount, did you? The one we talked about? Not on tired legs.” His tone was light, but the undercurrent of worry was unmistakable. He was her coach, her cheerleader, and her chief safety officer all rolled into one.
“No, I’m not an idiot,” she reassured him, though the thought had tempted her. A new, flashy finish for the finale. “Just basics. Form. Finding the lines. It was more for my head than my legs, anyway.”

They lapsed into a comfortable silence as Chloe finished her ministrations, cleaning the chain with an old rag before lifting Circe and hooking the saddle over the high wall-mounted rack they’d installed. There, the bike looked less like a mode of transport and more like a piece of minimalist sculpture. It hung above a framed poster from the 1948 London Olympics, a stylized cyclist in motion.

“Mrs Higgins from downstairs cornered me yesterday,” Liam said, following her into the kitchen. “Wants to know if you can get her tickets. Says she’s your biggest fan. I told her the show’s completely sold out, but she gave me a fiver and told me to ‘see what I can do’.” He waved a crumpled banknote at her. “You’ve got a fan club, Chlo. An elderly, lavender-scented fan club.”
Chloe groaned, slumping into one of their two mismatched kitchen chairs. “God, no. What did you do with the fiver?”
“Put it towards the celebratory champagne, obviously,” he said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “Not prosecco. The proper French stuff. For when you win.”

The word hung in the air between them. Win. It was a concept so outlandish, so far removed from the joke it had started as, that she still couldn't quite process it. “Don’t say that. It’s bad luck.”
“It’s not bad luck, it’s positive affirmation,” he countered, taking the seat opposite her. “Look, you’ve got this. The hamster kid is your only real competition.”
“Archie,” she corrected. “And his hamster wasn’t dead, it was just ill. It made a full recovery. They showed it on a VT last week, eating a tiny piece of broccoli. He’s got the whole nation behind him.”
“A temporary setback for his narrative arc, but you’re still stronger,” Liam insisted. “He just stands there and sings. You defy gravity on a metal frame. It’s not even the same sport. As for the others… the family of clog dancers have peaked, and that magician’s big finale is just making a caravan disappear. It’s a classic misdirection. The caravan’s probably been parked in the BBC car park since Tuesday.”

She had to smile. His forensic analysis of the competition was both ridiculous and deeply comforting. He believed in her with such uncomplicated fervour that it was almost impossible not to be carried along by it. Almost.
“It’s the stage, Liam,” she confessed, the real nub of her fear rising to the surface. “It’s so… big. And shiny. The industrial estate is predictable. The floor in the studio, under all those lights… it’s a different surface. One slip…”
He reached across the small table and stilled her hand, which had begun tapping a nervous rhythm against her mug. “You’ve ridden on wet leaves, on gravel, on roads slick with diesel. You once bunny-hopped a badger on a night ride to Guildford. You can handle a polished floor. You just have to trust the bike. Trust the friction. Trust yourself.” His gaze was steady, unwavering. “You’ve done the work, Chloe. All ten thousand hours of it. Tonight is just the bit where people watch.”His words, meant to be a comfort, landed with the weight of prophecy. Ten thousand hours. She’d never thought of it like that, had never tallied the pre-dawn starts, the rained-out afternoons, the endless, repetitive drills in empty car parks. It hadn't been work, not in that sense. It had been breathing. But now, framed as an investment on the verge of paying off, the pressure felt immense. She managed a thin smile, a fragile acknowledgement of his faith, and pushed her empty mug away. The coffee had done its job; the fog of sleep was gone, replaced by a sharp, thrumming anxiety. The day had begun.

The ritual of packing the van was a silent, well-choreographed routine. Liam backed the battered Transit as close to the flat's entrance as possible, its diesel engine grumbling impatiently. Chloe emerged with Circe, holding the bike as if it were made of spun glass. Together, they swaddled it in a collection of old, soft towels and thick blankets, a protective cocoon against the jolts and bumps of the M25. Every strap was double-checked, every buckle tightened. Liam referred to the van as their ‘team bus’, a grand title for a vehicle that smelled permanently of old oil and rust, and whose passenger-side door only opened from the inside. It was another part of their ridiculous, patched-together campaign, and Chloe loved it fiercely.

As Liam navigated the familiar roundabouts out of Woking, Chloe stared out of the window, watching her world slip by. The kebab shop on Chertsey Road, the retail park, the quiet residential streets. They were just shapes now, stripped of the intimate detail she knew so well. The van was a bubble of quiet tension. Liam, sensing her retreat into her own head, fiddled with the radio, a blast of aggressively cheerful morning-show chatter filling the cab before Chloe reached over and turned it off. He didn't protest, just gave a small nod and focused on the road. The silence that returned was heavier than before, filled with everything they weren't saying. The miles dissolved under their wheels, brick and weary green slowly giving way to the grey, imposing sprawl of London’s arteries.

Arrival at the studio complex was like docking at a space station. A uniformed security guard with a clipboard checked their names against a list, his eyes lingering on the blanket-wrapped shape in the back of the van with professional disinterest. He waved them through with a curt gesture, and they entered the belly of the beast. The backstage area was a maelstrom of controlled chaos. People with headsets and lanyards scurried past, speaking a clipped, urgent language of their own. The air was thick with the scent of hairspray and dry ice. They passed the family of clog dancers, the matriarch loudly berating her son for scuffing his clogs. Further on, the magician, looking harried, was in a heated discussion with a producer, gesturing wildly towards the car park. “But the pyrotechnics for the reveal are synced to the caravan door!” he was pleading, his glittery waistcoat seeming to droop with despair.

Chloe and Liam navigated the organised pandemonium, wheeling the shrouded Circe towards the designated talent area. Their dressing room was a small, white box, clinically clean, with a nameplate on the door that read ‘CHLOE ASHTON’. Inside, a mirror framed with bare, unforgiving bulbs dominated one wall. On a small table sat a bottle of water and a complimentary, and slightly sad-looking, fruit bowl. It felt as temporary and anonymous as a hotel room. While Chloe stood frozen in the centre of the room, taking it all in, Liam immediately sprang into action, creating their own small territory. He unpacked her cycling shoes, laying them neatly by the chair. He set up their small, professional-grade tyre pump in a corner and leaned her helmet against it. He was building a fortress of familiarity against the strangeness of it all.

A production assistant with a kind, tired face poked her head around the door. “Chloe? Stage walk-through in fifteen minutes. Just you, no equipment for now. We need to run the lighting cues.” The words were a jolt of electricity. Chloe’s breath hitched. This was it. The moment of reckoning with the shiny floor. Liam caught her eye in the mirror. He didn’t say anything, but his expression was the same one he’d given her across the crowded audition hall all those weeks ago. *You’ve got this.* She took a shaky breath, nodded at the assistant, and felt her professional mask begin to slide into place.

She walked the long, rubber-matted corridor towards the stage alone, the muffled sounds of the backstage world fading behind her. A heavy black curtain was pulled aside, and she stepped out into the arena. It was bigger and darker than she remembered. The vast banks of audience seats were an abyss, a thousand empty eyes staring back at her. In the centre of the stage, caught in a single, hazy spotlight, was the giant ‘Britain’s Best’ logo, painted onto the high-gloss black floor. Her nemesis. It looked slicker than oil on water, reflecting the complex web of the lighting rig above like a perfect, black mirror. A stagehand called out technical jargon to someone in the darkness, his voice echoing in the cavernous space.

Chloe walked slowly towards the centre, her trainers squeaking almost obscenely on the pristine surface. She stopped on the exact spot where Circe would need to be. She bent down, pretending to adjust her shoelace, and pressed the palm of her hand flat against the floor. It was cool, smooth, and utterly without texture. There was no grit, no reassuring friction, none of the honest roughness of tarmac. She stood up, her heart a cold, hard knot in her chest. This was a surface designed for sliding dancers and graceful singers, not for the pinpoint balance of rubber on a knife’s edge. For the first time since the dare over pizza, she felt a genuine, gut-wrenching certainty that she had made a terrible mistake.Chapter 2

She stood up from her crouch, the feeling of the floor a horrifying certainty that now lived in her bones. A voice from the shadowed control desk, amplified and impersonal, echoed through the empty theatre. “Okay, Chloe, lighting check. Walk to the X on stage left, please.” She obeyed, her body moving with a mechanical stiffness she didn’t recognise. Her mind had detached, hovering somewhere above, observing this strange puppet version of herself. The world had shrunk from the vast, dark auditorium to the ten-foot circle of treacherous territory she would be forced to command. It was the antithesis of her familiar tarmac, a surface designed to betray the very laws of friction and grip she had spent a decade mastering. The honest, gritty feedback of the road was gone, replaced by a beautiful, silent lie.

The disembodied voice guided her through a series of positions, calling out lighting states and camera angles. “Hold there, that’s Camera Three’s close-up.” A brilliant white light slammed into her, bleaching the world and making the floor gleam with malevolent invitation. “Now walk the centre line to downstage.” Every step was a cautious, calculated placement of her foot. She tried a tiny scuff, a subtle pivot of her heel. There was no purchase. The squeak of her trainers against the polished surface sounded less like friction and more like a plea. She imagined Circe’s tyres, no wider than her thumb, trying to find purchase on this ice-rink. The thought was so terrifyingly vivid she almost stumbled. She felt like a fraud, a plumber who had shown up to a gunfight, her entire skillset rendered utterly useless by a coat of varnish.

The walk back to the dressing room was a long, cold journey through a tunnel of her own fear. She pushed through the heavy black curtain and the cacophony of the backstage world washed over her, but she barely registered it. She opened the door to their small, white sanctuary. The sight of Liam, kneeling on the floor, calmly checking the pressure in Circe’s tyres with a digital gauge, was both a profound relief and the final crack in her composure. The mask of chipper competence she’d worn all day didn’t just slide off; it shattered.
“I can’t do it,” she whispered, the words ragged and foreign in her own mouth. Liam looked up, his expression of calm focus instantly clouding with concern. He stood, wiping his hands on his jeans.
“What do you mean? What’s wrong?”
“The floor, Liam.” The words came out in a rush now, tumbling over each other. “There’s no grip. It’s like… it's like polished ice. It’s a laminate, a high-gloss one. My trainers were squeaking all over it. There’s nothing to hold on to. A handstand will be impossible. The backward circle… I’ll just slide out. I can’t do it on that.” She slumped into the chair in front of the brightly lit mirror, burying her face in her hands. The reflection that stared back from between her fingers was pale and defeated. The girl from Woking who did handstands on a pushbike was gone.

Liam was silent for a moment. He didn’t rush to offer platitudes or dismiss her fears. Instead, he knelt in front of her, his movements slow and deliberate. He took one of her hands away from her face, his calloused mechanic’s fingers warm against her cold skin.
“Okay,” he said, his voice low and steady. “Okay. So the surface is the problem. Not you. Not the bike. The surface.” He was diagnosing it, breaking it down into a technical challenge rather than an emotional catastrophe. “Tell me exactly what it felt like. Was it dusty? Waxy?”
“No, just… smooth. Clean. Utterly, perfectly smooth.”
A flicker of something—not panic, but intense calculation—crossed his face. He released her hand and turned to the large, battered toolbox he’d insisted on bringing, the one filled with more specialised equipment than their entire bike shop. He began to rummage with a quiet intensity, pushing aside wrenches and spoke keys. After a moment, he let out a soft “Aha!” and emerged with a small plastic bottle of clear liquid and a pristine, folded microfiber cloth.
“Isopropanol,” he announced, holding the bottle up as if it were a holy relic. “Ninety-nine-point-nine percent pure. No oils, no additives, no residue. We use it for cleaning disc brake rotors. It strips away everything.”

He looked from the bottle to her, and the focused glint in his eye was back, brighter than ever. “We can’t change the floor, Chlo. But we can change the tyres. Just before you go on, we’re going to clean every millimetre of the contact surface. We’ll strip them down to pure, virgin rubber. It’ll make them tacky. It won’t turn the stage into tarmac, but it will give you the maximum possible grip that physics will allow. It’ll give you a fighting chance.”
It wasn’t a guarantee. It wasn't a magic spell. It was a plan, rooted in science and a deep understanding of their craft. It was an act of defiance. Hope, fragile but fierce, began to push back against the cold tide of her fear. She looked at him, truly seeing the unwavering belief that radiated from him, a belief not just in her, but in the elegant mechanics of friction and force. She straightened up in the chair and took the soft cloth from his hand.
“Okay,” she said, her voice stronger now. “Show me exactly how.”

The next few hours passed in a surreal, disjointed dream. A cheerful woman named Tina descended upon Chloe with a case full of powders and brushes, chattering about waterproof mascara “for the happy tears” and contouring to “really pop under the stage lights.” Chloe sat like a statue, her mind far away, as the woman painted a stranger’s face onto her own. Through the walls, she could hear the muffled thunder of the clog dancers’ routine, followed by a roar from the audience that seemed to vibrate up through the floor. Later, a wave of perfume and nervous energy announced the arrival of Krystal, the pop-star judge, who swept down the corridor wishing every finalist good luck with the same dazzling, impersonal smile. Liam stood guard by the door, a stoic sentry, turning away anyone who tried to enter with a polite but immovable firmness. He and Circe were a silent, united front.

Then came the call, delivered by the same kind, tired assistant as before. “Chloe, five minutes.” Her stomach lurched, a violent, sickening drop. This was it. The air in the small room suddenly felt thick, heavy to breathe. Liam gave her a sharp, intense nod. He didn’t offer any last-minute words of encouragement. Instead, he picked up the bottle of isopropanol and the cloth. It was time for their new ritual. He tilted the bike towards her, and she knelt, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. Together, in a silence that felt more profound than any speech, they meticulously wiped down the surface of the tyres. The sharp, clean scent of the alcohol filled the air, a final purification before battle. He helped her to her feet, his hands steady on her shoulders.
“This isn't for them,” he said, his voice low and fierce, with a nod in the vague direction of the unseen audience. “This isn’t for Sir Reginald or the TV cameras. This is for the industrial estate. For the 4:30 mornings. For every hairline crack in the pavement you ever memorised.” He looked her straight in the eye, his own reflecting the harsh light of the dressing room mirror. “Just go out there and have your ride, Chlo.”His words were the final turn of a key, locking her focus into place. The fear didn't vanish, but it receded, transformed into a familiar, high-frequency hum of adrenaline. It was the same energy that fuelled her pre-dawn rides, a clean, potent fuel for the work ahead. She gave him a single, sharp nod, a silent promise. The time for words was over. The kind-faced assistant appeared at the door again, her expression now urgent. "Chloe, you're on. Let's go." Liam squeezed her shoulder one last time before stepping back, handing over the reins. The journey from their small white room to the wings of the stage was a walk through a gauntlet of sound and light. The thunderous applause for the magician, who had apparently succeeded in making his caravan vanish, was still echoing through the building. Stagehands rushed past, coiling cables and pushing wheeled platforms with silent, urgent efficiency. It was a different world from the one she had walked through just hours before. Then, she had been an observer. Now, she was the next component in the vast, complex machine of live television.

She stood in the wings, a sliver of darkness just beyond the glare of the lights, with Circe cool and steady beside her. On a monitor, she could see the magician taking his bow, his sequined waistcoat practically incandescent under the lights. The host, a man with impossibly white teeth and a perfectly tailored suit, bounded onto the stage to join him. The judges' faces filled the screen in a three-way split. Krystal was dabbing her eyes—"It was just so magical!" Sir Reginald looked unimpressed but not actively disgusted, which was high praise. Anton was offering a technical critique of the misdirection. Then the host turned to the camera, his voice booming through the studio and from the monitor in front of her. "And now, for our final act of the night! She’s the girl from Woking who turned her daily commute into a work of art. She’s stunned the judges and captured the nation’s heart with her bicycle ballet. Please welcome… Chloe Ashton!"

The roar that erupted from the unseen audience was a physical force, a wave of pressure that seemed to push the air from her lungs. This was it. She took a deep breath, the clean, sharp scent of isopropanol a secret anchor in the sensory overload. She pushed off the wall and wheeled Circe into the light. The heat was the first thing she noticed, a dry, intense warmth from hundreds of spotlights. The floor was a black, gleaming void, and the sound of ten thousand people was a disorienting, shapeless noise. She walked towards the giant X at the centre of the stage, her focus narrowing with every step, until all that existed was her, the bike, and the twenty-foot circle of polished black floor. She could feel the stares, the weight of expectation from the dark abyss of the audience and the three small figures at the judges’ desk. She ignored them all. This was for the industrial estate.

She swung her leg over the saddle, the worn leather a familiar comfort. For a second, she just sat there, her hands on the handlebars, one foot on the pedal, the other on the floor. She let the noise wash over her, let her heartbeat settle into a steady rhythm. Then, she pushed off. The first rotation of the pedals was the moment of truth. She felt the tyres connect with the surface. It wasn't tarmac. It wasn't even close. But there was a faint, sticky resistance that hadn't been there before. It was a whisper of grip, but it was there. Liam’s plan had worked. It was enough. She built momentum slowly, deliberately, completing a single, perfect circle around the logo. This was her territory now. She was drawing her own lines on their pristine map.

Faster now, she found her cadence, the sweet spot where muscle and machine became one. The world outside her circle blurred. The roar of the crowd faded to a dull hum. There was only the whisper of the tyres and the metronomic tick of her own heart. It was time. In one fluid movement, she swung both legs over the handlebars, her body facing backwards, steering with her hands behind her back. She felt the infinitesimal slide as she changed direction, a tiny lateral drift her legs instantly corrected for. The tacky rubber held. She pedalled in a reverse circle, her eyes fixed on the distant red glow of an exit sign to keep her balance. A collective gasp rippled through the audience, a sound she felt more than heard. They hadn't seen this part in the auditions.

She rose from the backwards position, stepping one foot onto the saddle and the other onto the handlebars, her arms outstretched. The tightrope walker. She held the pose for a long moment, carving a slow, elegant arc across the stage, a silent sculpture in motion. The balance was precarious, every tiny twitch of her core muscles keeping her from disaster. From there, she launched herself into the move that had first silenced the producers. Her hands gripped the handlebars, her legs scissored into the air, and she pushed up into a perfect, trembling handstand. The world inverted. The judges' desk, the sea of upturned faces in the first few rows, the blinding web of lights above. Below her, the back wheel spun, a gyroscopic anchor in an upside-down universe. The burn ignited in her shoulders, a roaring fire she embraced. She held it, counting the seconds in her head. Five. Ten. Fifteen. Longer than ever before. With controlled strength, she lowered herself back down, landing softly on the frame, swinging her legs back to the pedals without ever breaking momentum.

The routine was almost over. She had done it. She had tamed the floor. She could finish now, come to a clean, simple stop on the X and it would be enough. It would be a triumph. But as she circled the stage, the adrenaline singing in her veins, she knew 'enough' wasn't what this was about. This was for all the times she’d held back, for the chipper mask she wore at the shop, for the quiet girl who felt more at home with machines than people. It was time for the madness. It was time for the new dismount. She picked a spot, a final destination just in front of the judges’ desk. She pedalled hard, building more speed than was sensible in such a confined space, a final surge of power. Then, as she hit her mark, she did the one thing a fixed-gear cyclist is taught never to do. She stopped pedalling. All at once. She threw her weight backwards, locking her legs and resisting the bike's ferocious desire to keep moving forward. The back wheel, stripped of its tacky surface by the friction, broke free from the floor. For a split second, Circe went into a controlled, screaming skid, leaving a faint black line of sacrificed rubber on the pristine floor. Just as the bike shuddered to a complete, violent halt, Chloe unclipped her right foot and stepped off, landing perfectly on two feet, her hand still resting on the saddle. Circe stood perfectly still, a silent, obedient partner.

The silence that followed was absolute. It was deeper and more profound than the one in the audition room. It was a vast, cavernous silence created by ten thousand people holding their breath at once. Chloe stood panting, her chest heaving, sweat dripping from her chin onto the stage. She was back in her body, the roar of blood in her ears louder than anything else. She looked up. Krystal’s jaw was on the desk, her mascara-rimmed eyes wide with disbelief. Anton, the choreographer, was on his feet, applauding slowly and deliberately, a look of pure, analytical admiration on his face. But her eyes found Sir Reginald Pike. The hanging judge. His face, usually a mask of weary disdain, was utterly transformed. He was staring at the single black line on the floor, then back at her, and a slow, unbelievable smile was spreading across his face. Then, he too, got to his feet, and began to applaud. It was the signal the audience had been waiting for. The silence shattered, and the studio erupted in a tidal wave of sound so loud it felt like it could tear the roof off.Chapter 3

The applause was a physical thing, a tidal wave of sound that vibrated up through the soles of her shoes and into her bones. Chloe stood panting, her body still humming with the violent aftershock of the skid, every muscle screaming in a language of glorious exhaustion. It was a clean burn, a fire well-spent. Her gaze shot past the blur of the judges’ desk, past the blinding lights, searching the shadows for the only verdict that mattered. She found him. Liam was standing in the wings, his hands gripping a lighting rig for support, his face a perfect, breathtaking portrait of shock and ecstatic pride. He wasn’t looking at the stage or the crowd; his eyes were locked on hers. His mouth formed a single, silent word, a callback to the very beginning. *Chicken*. A wild, delirious laugh bubbled up from her chest, catching in her throat and mixing with her ragged breaths.

The show’s host, a man whose teeth seemed to generate their own light, glided to her side, his arm hovering near her back as if she were a volatile piece of machinery. "Chloe Ashton!" he bellowed into his microphone, his voice straining to be heard over the unrelenting din. "Unbelievable! Just... unbelievable!" The crowd roared its agreement. As the applause slowly, reluctantly, subsided, the host turned his attention to the judges. Krystal went first, her voice thick with emotion, her carefully applied makeup already failing its primary purpose. "Chloe, I... I don't even have the words. That wasn't just a talent, that was... it was dangerous and beautiful and I felt like my heart was going to stop. It was art, darling, pure art!" Anton was nodding, his choreographer’s eyes narrowed in serious appreciation. "The technical control is astonishing. The core strength, the precision... that final skid-stop is a move of such high risk, such perfect execution. To generate and then absorb that much force... it's world-class. Truly world-class."

Then all eyes, including the host's and Chloe's, turned to Sir Reginald Pike. The brief, shocking smile was gone, replaced by his customary thoughtful scowl, but there was a different quality to it now, a new weight. He leaned into his microphone, and a hush fell over the entire studio. "For ten weeks," he began, his voice a low, commanding rumble that needed no amplification, "I have sat here and watched singers sing, dancers dance, and magicians perform their deceptions. I have been, by turns, bored, irritated, and occasionally mildly impressed." He paused, letting the crushing weight of his judgment hang in the air. "But I have never, until this moment, been afraid. Not for your safety, young lady—your control is absolute—but afraid of the sheer, raw, audacious talent on display. You took a bicycle, an object of mundane utility, and you forced it to be beautiful. You left your mark on my stage," he gestured to the faint black line on the floor as if it were a signature on a masterpiece, "and you have left your mark on this competition. Tonight, you did not just perform. You dominated."

The impact of Sir Reginald’s words was more powerful than any applause. *Dominated*. The word echoed in her head as the host guided her off-stage, the lights fading behind them. The moment she crossed the threshold into the comparative darkness of the wings, Liam was there. He didn’t say anything. He just wrapped her in a hug so tight it lifted her off her feet, burying his face in her shoulder. She clung to him, the solid reality of him an anchor in the dizzying chaos, smelling the familiar scent of coffee and metal that was purely him. She could feel him shaking with laughter or relief, she wasn't sure which. He set her down, holding her at arm's length, his eyes wild with a frantic energy. "The skid!" he half-shouted over the noise. "You did the bloody skid! I almost had a heart attack! It was magnificent!" They were immediately swarmed by production assistants, one handing her a bottle of water, another trying to clip a new microphone to her shirt. "Phone lines are open for ten minutes! We need you in the green room," someone was saying, but it all just sounded like static. Chloe’s world had shrunk to the size of Liam’s grinning face, and the shared, impossible victory reflected in his eyes.

The green room was a pressure cooker of frayed nerves and forced smiles. Archie, the ten-year-old singing sensation, sat quietly in a corner, sipping a juice box and looking impossibly small and calm while his parents fussed over him. The clog-dancing family were huddled together, the matriarch muttering about timing. Chloe and Liam found a space on a sofa, and a stagehand carefully brought Circe in, leaning her against the wall where she seemed to radiate a quiet power. The black line on her rear tyre looked like a proud battle scar. For ten minutes, the television broadcast played on the monitors, showing recaps of each performance and urging the nation to vote. Chloe watched the stranger in sequins on the screen, performing impossible feats. It didn't feel real. Liam’s leg jiggled nervously beside her, the only outward sign of his tension. "Sir Reginald Pike smiled," he whispered, as if relaying a celestial event. "I saw it with my own eyes. That's got to be worth a million votes on its own."

The call came all too soon. "Finalists to the stage, please." The walk back was different this time. A sense of irreversible finality hung in the air. They lined up in the wings, a strange, motley crew of Britain's hopefuls. Chloe stood between Archie and the lead clog dancer. She caught Archie’s eye, and he gave her a small, shy smile. "You were really cool," he whispered. "Thanks," she whispered back. "You have a great voice." It was a simple, honest exchange in the heart of the storm. Then the music swelled, and they were herded back out into the blinding light, lining up across the vast stage. The host stood centre, holding a single golden envelope. The theatre was electric with anticipation, the air so thick with it she felt she could taste it. The moment stretched, thin and taut. "The votes have been counted and verified," the host announced, his voice ringing with theatrical gravity. "The winner of Britain’s Best, and the grand prize of one hundred thousand pounds, is..." He opened the envelope with agonizing slowness. Chloe found she wasn't breathing. She wasn't thinking about the money, or the fame, only about a greasy pizza, a stupid dare, and the man who had believed in her when she hadn't believed in herself. Her eyes found him again in the wings, and he gave her one last, small, firm nod. *You've got this.*

"...Chloe Ashton!" The name slammed into her, not as a word, but as a detonation of light and sound. A bank of cannons fired, showering the stage in a blizzard of golden confetti. The roar from the audience was a physical blow, a solid wall of sound that made her stagger. Archie was instantly by her side, giving her a quick, polite hug. The clog dancers were applauding enthusiastically. The host was pushing a large, ornate glass trophy into her hands. It was unexpectedly heavy. She stared at it, at her own name engraved at its base, the letters shimmering through the falling gold. It made no sense. The host was shouting questions into her ear, but she couldn’t hear him. Her hearing had been replaced by a high-pitched ringing. She looked up, past the confetti, past the lights, to the judges' desk. Sir Reginald was giving her a respectful nod. And then she looked to the wings. Liam had pushed past a frantic stage manager and was half-running, half-stumbling towards her. He didn’t stop until he reached her, ignoring the cameras, the host, the entire spectacle. He wrapped his arms around her again, and this time, when he laughed, she could hear it loud and clear, a sound of pure, unadulterated joy that cut through everything else. "I told you so," he shouted into her ear, his voice breaking with emotion. "I told you so!" She held the ridiculously heavy trophy between them, laughing and crying all at once, as the golden confetti rained down on them, two people from Woking in the centre of an impossible, wonderful dream.Chapter 4

The golden blizzard eventually thinned, the last flakes of foil and paper drifting down to coat the stage in a shimmering, festive dust. The noise, however, did not subside. It simply changed its nature, morphing from a roar of applause into the chaotic, high-pitched clamour of the show’s immediate aftermath. Chloe felt herself being propelled by unseen hands, a disorienting journey through a labyrinth of back-slapping producers, grinning television executives, and reporters shouting questions that felt like small, sharp stones. "Chloe, how does it feel?" "What will you do with the money?" "Is this the end for Woking Wheels?" The trophy was a dead weight in her arms, cold and impossibly solid, the only thing that felt real in the swirling vortex of unreality. Liam was a solid wall at her side, his arm firmly around her waist, acting as a human shield. He fielded the questions with a curt, protective "She needs a minute," his voice a low growl of authority that managed to part the sea of grasping hands and flashing cameras, guiding her inexorably towards the relative sanity of the backstage corridor.

Their dressing room, when they finally tumbled into it, was an oasis of profound silence. The harsh, naked bulbs around the mirror seemed to hum with the lingering energy of the night. The sad fruit bowl sat untouched on the table, a comical relic from a different lifetime. Chloe carefully placed the heavy glass trophy next to it, where it caught the light and threw fractured rainbows across the sterile white walls. She sank into the chair and stared at her reflection. The woman looking back was a stranger, her face an artfully painted mask of foundation and blush, her eyes wide and dark with shock. She touched her own cheek, half-expecting to feel a different person's skin. Liam didn’t speak. Instead, he began their pack-up ritual with a quiet, methodical reverence. He carefully collapsed the tyre pump. He took one of the soft towels they had used to wrap Circe and began, with absurd gentleness, to swaddle the trophy in it, as if it too were a priceless, fragile piece of equipment. He wrapped it until it was just a lumpy, anonymous bundle, then placed it carefully into a large canvas bag. The act was so practical, so normal, that it was the first thing to truly ground her since the host had called her name. He was packing up their victory to take it home.

The journey back to Woking in the team bus was a surreal pilgrimage. The van, which had felt so tense and charged on the way in, was now a pocket of quiet exhaustion. The M25 at two in the morning was a ribbon of deserted tarmac, lit by the hypnotic orange glow of the streetlights. The wrapped trophy sat on the passenger seat between them, a silent, lumpy passenger radiating a strange, muted power. Circe was safely cocooned in the back, the fine black line on her rear tyre a secret testament to their triumph. Chloe leaned her head against the cool glass of the window, watching the city’s harsh lights bleed into the softer darkness of the suburbs. The adrenaline had finally ebbed away, leaving a deep, bone-weary exhaustion in its wake. There were no grand pronouncements, no triumphant shouts. The reality of what had happened was too vast and strange to be contained in words. After a long silence, Liam spoke, his voice quiet in the grumbling cab. "Mrs Higgins is going to lose her mind." Chloe let out a huff of laughter that was half a sob. It was the perfect, ridiculous thing to say. It tethered the colossal, life-changing event to the familiar, lavender-scented reality of their life above the laundrette.

Pulling into their street felt like arriving in a foreign country she only vaguely recognised. The town was asleep, shrouded in the deep, quiet dark that comes just before the first hint of dawn. The kebab shop on Chertsey Road was a dark shell, its neon sign dormant. The whole world seemed blissfully unaware that its mundane patterns had been spectacularly disrupted. Liam parked the battered Transit in its usual spot, the tired sigh of the handbrake sounding impossibly loud in the silence. They got out, stretching their cramped limbs, the cool night air a welcome balm. Carrying the bag with the swaddled trophy, Liam’s toolbox, and wheeling a still-shrouded Circe up the narrow flight of stairs to their flat felt like smuggling treasure. The scent of industrial-strength fabric softener from Woking Suds greeted them like an old friend. Liam fumbled with the key, the sound of the lock turning a loud, definitive click. This was the moment of transition. They were stepping out of the dream and back into their lives, only to find the dream had followed them home.

Inside, the flat was exactly as they had left it. The precarious stacks of cycling magazines, the faint smell of old coffee, the stylised Olympic poster on the wall. It was their cluttered, comfortable, ordinary home. But in the middle of it all, everything was different. Liam placed the canvas bag on their small kitchen table and, with the same reverence as before, unwrapped the trophy. In the dim light of their kitchen, it seemed to glow with an internal luminescence, a bizarre alien artifact dropped into the heart of their world. Chloe reached out and traced the sharp edges of her engraved name with a trembling finger. It was real. All of it. Liam disappeared into the kitchen and returned not with mugs, but with two mismatched wine glasses and the bottle of proper French champagne he had promised. He wrestled with the cork, which, after the high-stakes tension of the night, refused to pop with any sort of celebratory drama, instead easing out with a gentle, apologetic hiss. He poured the bubbling golden liquid into the glasses. He raised his glass, his eyes, crinkled with exhaustion and joy, meeting hers over the rim. "To bicycle ballet," he said, his voice soft. "And not saying no." Chloe clinked her glass against his. "To dead hamsters," she replied, and they both started laughing, a quiet, exhausted, utterly happy sound that was swallowed instantly by the sleeping town.They drank the champagne, the delicate bubbles a strange and foreign sensation on their tongues, so different from cheap prosecco or post-ride beer. The laughter subsided, leaving a comfortable, humming silence in its wake, punctuated only by the faint fizz from their glasses. The exhaustion, held at bay for hours by a dam of pure adrenaline, was beginning to seep through the cracks, a heavy, pulling tide. They sat at their small, cluttered kitchen table, the ridiculously grand trophy standing between them like a visitor from another planet, the first grey light of dawn beginning to soften the edges of the room.

"His face," Chloe said quietly, swirling the golden liquid in her glass. "When I did the skid. Sir Reginald. He looked... startled."
"Startled?" Liam let out a low chuckle, shaking his head in disbelief. "Chlo, he looked like he’d just witnessed a unicorn solve a Rubik's cube. I thought his monocle was going to pop out, and he doesn’t even wear one. You broke his brain." He took a long sip of champagne, his eyes fixed on the faint black mark on Circe’s rear tyre, visible even in the dim light. "The skid. You absolute maniac. I was watching from the wings, my entire career as your unpaid mechanic flashing before my eyes. All I could think was 'she's going to slide out and take out the whole judges' desk'."
"I wasn't," she said, a flicker of the on-stage certainty returning. "The isopropanol. It made the initial grip perfect. I knew it would hold for the first part of the routine. I also knew it would burn off clean for the skid. It was just… physics."
"It was just madness," he countered, but his voice was full of awe. "It was the most beautiful, terrifying piece of physics I've ever seen."

The sequined fabric of her performance top began to itch, a sudden, irritating reminder of the artifice she was still wearing. The makeup on her face felt like a thick, heavy mask, caked with sweat and the faint residue of golden confetti. She stood up, her movements slow and stiff. She needed to wash this other person away. In their tiny bathroom, she leaned over the basin and turned on the tap, splashing her face with cold water. She worked the soap into a lather, scrubbing away the waterproof mascara, the heavy foundation, the shimmering highlighter. She watched as the colours swirled down the drain, a river of tan, black, and gold, carrying the televised version of herself away. When she finally looked up, her face scrubbed raw and clean, it was just her in the mirror. Chloe from Woking. Tired, pale, and with a few stray pieces of glitter still clinging stubbornly to her eyebrows, like tiny, stubborn stars.

When she returned to the kitchen, Liam hadn't moved. He was staring at the trophy, a thoughtful frown on his face. The rising sun was now sending a direct, pale yellow beam through their small window, striking the glass and refracting into a dazzling spray of light that danced across the ceiling. The moment felt fragile, caught between the impossible night and the inevitable day. Liam finally looked up from the trophy, his gaze meeting hers.
"One hundred thousand pounds," he said. The number landed in the quiet room not with a bang, but with a solid, definitive thud. It wasn't a question or a celebration, just a fact they had to begin to process. He gestured vaguely around their cramped living space. "You know what that means?"
Chloe shook her head, the scope of it still too vast to comprehend.
"It means," he said, a slow, wondrous smile spreading across his face, "we can finally get a proper coffee machine for the shop. An Italian one. With the shiny group heads and everything."
Of all the things the money could buy – a new van, a deposit on a house, a life without financial worry – it was that one, small, shared dream that made it feel real. It wasn't about fame or a new life; it was about upgrading the old one. "And a heater," she added, her voice barely a whisper. "A proper heating system for the workshop, so my fingers don’t go numb when I’m truing wheels in January."

The spell was broken by a violent, jarring buzz from the countertop. Her phone, which had been on silent and forgotten for what felt like a decade, was vibrating against the formica, its screen lit up with a furious intensity. They both stared at it as if it were a live grenade. The outside world was knocking, and it was not being polite. The screen flashed a name that was both comforting and terrifying: ‘Mum’. Chloe’s hand trembled as she reached for it, her thumb hovering over the green icon. Answering this call would be the real acceptance of her victory, the official acknowledgement that their quiet, two-person bubble had been irrevocably burst.
"It was going to happen sooner or later," Liam said softly, giving her a small, encouraging nod. She took a breath and answered.
"Chloe? Oh my god, Chloe, are you there?" Her mother’s voice was a high-pitched, joyous shriek, layered over the sound of other excited voices in the background. "We saw you! We were all here, your dad, your aunt Carol, the next-door neighbours! We were screaming so loud I think we scared the cat! Oh, you were just wonderful! And that final stop! Your father stood up and shouted 'That's my girl!' He nearly knocked over the whole tray of tea!"

Chloe held the phone slightly away from her ear, a weak smile on her face as she listened to the unfiltered, chaotic love pouring down the line. It was overwhelming, but it was also beautifully, blessedly normal. "Hi, Mum. Yeah, I'm okay. We just got in."
"Just got in? Oh, you must be exhausted! Is Liam with you? Tell him I said he needs to make sure you eat something! Everyone has been calling the house phone off the hook, the local paper, people I haven't heard from in twenty years! The whole street was watching, Chloe! Mrs Henderson from number 42 said she was voting for you so many times she nearly broke her television! You're a celebrity!" The word, meant as the highest possible praise, landed like a stone in her stomach. She saw Liam wince in sympathy. The celebration on one end of the line felt a world away from the quiet, exhausted reality of their kitchen. After promising to call back later, after promising to visit, after promising to get some rest, she finally managed to end the call, pressing the button and letting the sudden silence of the flat rush back in. It was a different kind of silence now. It was no longer peaceful. It was the silence of a stage waiting for the next act to begin. Liam’s own phone, which had been lying face down, lit up. Then lit up again. And again. A relentless barrage of notifications. He picked it up, his thumb scrolling through the lock screen. "Texts from... everyone," he murmured. "And the Woking Wheels Instagram has three thousand new followers." He looked up from the screen, his expression a mixture of awe and alarm. "Chlo," he said, his voice dropping an octave. "I think we have a problem."Chapter 4

Liam’s use of the word “problem” hung in the air, a stark counterpoint to the celebratory champagne fizzing in their glasses. He turned his phone so she could see the screen. It was a waterfall of notifications, a relentless cascade of likes, shares, and comments pouring in from all corners of the internet. The Woking Wheels Instagram account, which usually garnered a polite handful of likes for a nicely shot picture of a new chainset, was exploding. Her own long-neglected personal profile was a digital bonfire. He tapped on a trending topics list for the UK. Her name was at number two, just below a breaking political scandal and just above a globally famous pop star’s new album release. #BicycleBallet was number four.
“This isn’t just a few people from the neighbourhood watching, Chlo,” he said, his voice low and serious. “This is…everyone. That video of the skid, someone’s ripped it from the broadcast. It has over a million views already. On Twitter.” He looked from the phone to her, his earlier elation tempered by a dawning, sober reality. “We were so focused on the floor, on the routine… we never actually thought about what would happen if you won.”

The numbers on the screen were abstract, meaningless. A million views. Three thousand new followers. They were just digits, yet they represented an invisible crowd, a vast, faceless mass of people who now felt they knew a piece of her. The private, ritualistic act she performed in the pre-dawn solitude of an industrial estate had been broadcast, packaged, and consumed. A feeling of profound violation, cold and sharp, cut through the warm champagne haze. She wanted to take the phone and throw it against the wall, to smash the glowing portal through which the world was now pouring into their quiet, cluttered sanctuary.
“Turn it off,” she whispered, her voice tight. “Turn both of them off.”
Liam didn’t hesitate. He powered his down without a second thought. Chloe followed suit, the screen on her own phone going dark with a satisfying finality. For a moment, the silence in the kitchen felt restored, the digital invasion repelled. But they both knew it was a temporary fix, like putting a piece of tape over a crack in a bursting dam. The world was still out there, buzzing and waiting. They had only muted the sound, not the source. The sun was now fully risen, its morning light filling the room with an unwelcome clarity, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and the deep shadows of exhaustion under their eyes.

They abandoned the half-finished champagne and moved through the motions of preparing for bed, though the sky outside was brightening for the day. Sleep felt like an impossible goal, a distant shore they couldn't reach, but the ritual of it was a comfort. As Chloe brushed her teeth, she caught sight of the faint, glittery stars still clinging to her eyebrows and scrubbed at them with a frustrated sigh. They were stubborn, refusing to be washed away, tiny, shimmering reminders of the spectacle she couldn't escape. When she finally fell into her bed, the clean, familiar scent of her own sheets a small mercy, her mind refused to quiet. It replayed the night in a frantic, disjointed loop: the slickness of the floor, the roar of the crowd, the impossible weight of the trophy, the look of stunned admiration on Sir Reginald’s face. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the blinding glare of the spotlights. Sleep, when it finally came, was not a peaceful darkness but a shallow, restless state, punctuated by dreams of pedalling furiously on a wheel that spun but went nowhere, while the sound of a vast, unseen audience grew ever louder.

She was woken hours later by a sound that had become an alien intrusion: the insistent, buzzing trill of a landline. Theirs was a relic, a dusty cream-coloured phone that sat on a small hallway table, used only by their elderly relatives and the occasional cold-caller trying to sell them insurance. It rang with a shrill, demanding persistence that was impossible to ignore. Liam stumbled out of his room, his hair sticking up in a sleep-mangled mess, and stared at the offending object as if it might explode. On the fourth ring, he snatched it up.
“Hello?” he grunted, his voice thick with sleep. There was a pause. “No, she’s not available.” Another pause, his expression hardening. “No, I am not her agent. I’m her housemate. And no, I can’t give you a quote on how it feels to have Woking’s newest celebrity under our roof.” He listened for another second, his jaw tightening. “Listen, mate, it’s nine o’clock on a Sunday morning. She just won a national TV show ten hours ago. Give her a break.” He slammed the phone down into its cradle with a resounding crack of plastic. He looked at Chloe, who was standing in her doorway, wrapped in a duvet. “Woking Gazette,” he said, running a hand through his hair. “They want an exclusive. They’re camped outside.”

The words sent a jolt of pure dread through her. Outside. They were right outside their front door. She crept to the living room window, her heart pounding, and peered cautiously through a gap in the blinds. Their quiet street, usually deserted on a Sunday morning apart from a few dog-walkers, was not quiet. A white van with the local news station's logo was parked across the road. A photographer with a long-lensed camera was leaning against the wall of the laundrette, drinking coffee from a paper cup. A small cluster of neighbours and curious passers-by were gathered on the pavement, talking in low voices and pointing up at their window. She felt a wave of nausea, a dizzying, claustrophobic sensation of being watched, of her home no longer being a fortress but a fishbowl.
"They can't just stay there," she said, her voice a horrified whisper.
"They can, and they will," Liam replied, coming to stand behind her, his gaze grim. "Until they get what they want. A picture. A statement." He sighed, a long, weary sound. "Welcome to the rest of your life, I guess."
His words were meant to be wry, but they landed with the chilling finality of a prophecy. This was the price of the trophy sitting on their kitchen table. The quiet anonymity she had mistaken for a given was, in fact, a luxury she had just unknowingly cashed in. The pre-dawn rides, the secret confessions whispered to a sleeping town—they were no longer just for her. They were part of a backstory, a narrative that now belonged to the public. She felt a desperate, suffocating need for air, for escape. Not the fluid, graceful escape of a ride on Circe, but a frantic, burrowing escape back into a life where no one knew her name.Chapter 5

His words hung in the air, a final, grim punctuation mark on the end of their dream. Chloe backed away from the window as if the glass were hot, the image of the photographer and the waiting van burned onto the back of her eyes. Her home, the one place that was unequivocally hers, had been turned into a stage, and she was the unwilling star trapped in the dressing room. She retreated to the centre of the living room, feeling exposed even there, surrounded by the familiar clutter that suddenly felt like inadequate camouflage. She could hear the low murmur of the small crowd outside, a sound that carried a new and terrifying quality of ownership, as if they were discussing a property they had collectively acquired. The pre-dawn quiet she cherished had been a fragile gift, and now it was gone, shattered by the cacophony of her own success.

The landline rang again, its shrill cry even more violent in the tense silence. Liam snatched it from the cradle mid-ring, his voice a low growl. "What?" He listened, his face hardening into a mask of pure contempt. "No. And for the last time, I'm not his bloody agent either... How much?" He straightened up, a look of incredulous disgust on his face. "You want to offer us money for a 'behind the scenes' story of her tears? Shove your five-figure offer up your—" He stopped himself, catching Chloe’s wide-eyed stare, and with a final, withering glare at the receiver as if it were the reporter himself, he slammed it down again. He turned to her, his hands clenched into fists. "A tabloid. They wanted to know if you cried when you got home. They're trying to buy your emotions, Chloe." The violation of it was so profound, so grotesque, it left her feeling cold and empty. The joy of the win, the pride, the sheer relief—it was all just currency to them, another commodity to be bought and sold.

The true, mundane horror of their situation revealed itself a few moments later. Liam opened the fridge, stared into its brightly-lit interior, and closed it with a soft, defeated click. "We're out of milk," he announced, the statement landing with the weight of a major catastrophe. "And coffee beans. We used the last of them yesterday morning." It was such a small, domestic crisis, but it was the detail that broke through her shock and landed as pure, unadulterated panic. They were trapped. They couldn't make a cup of tea. They couldn't perform the simple morning ritual that had started every single one of their days together. They were prisoners in their own home, besieged by a world that wanted to consume them, and they couldn’t even have a decent brew while they waited. Chloe's gaze fell on Circe, leaning silently against the wall. The bike, her partner in flight, her tool of absolute freedom, looked as trapped as she felt. It was a grounded bird, a beautiful, useless sculpture, its potential for escape neutered by the crowd outside.

Liam began to pace the small confines of their living room, a caged animal mapping the edges of its enclosure. He ran his hands through his hair, his mind, the mechanic’s mind, searching for a way out, a solution to a problem with no obvious tools. "We can't go out the front. We can't wait until dark, they'll just bring in reinforcements with night-vision lenses or something. The fire escape drops you right into the laundrette's side yard, it’s just as exposed." He stopped, his gaze dropping to the floorboards beneath his feet. He stood perfectly still for a second, a thought taking shape behind his eyes, the familiar, focused glint of a plan being born. "Woking Suds," he said, the name of the laundrette no longer a punchline but a lifeline. "Mrs Higgins."

He turned to Chloe, the frantic energy in his eyes replaced by a sharp, strategic calm. "The shop has a back room, for storage. And that back room has a door that opens onto the service alley behind the building. The alley runs the whole length of the block. It comes out on the next street over, right where I left the van." He laid out the plan with the precision of a general planning a covert operation. It was their one blind spot, their one unguarded flank. The unglamorous, bin-lined artery of their neighbourhood was their secret escape route. Without another word, he strode to the kitchen counter and picked up his phone. He powered it on, grimacing as the screen exploded with a frantic, overwhelming volley of notifications. He ignored them all, his thumb scrolling with purpose through his contacts until he found the name he was looking for, listed simply as ‘Mrs H (Downstairs)’.

The phone call was a masterclass in controlled diplomacy. Mrs Higgins answered on the first ring, her voice a breathless flurry of excitement. "Liam, dear! Oh, I knew it! I knew you'd call! I've been telling everyone, I said to Derek next door, 'That Chloe, she's a superstar, and a lovely, quiet tenant to boot!'" Liam let her gush for a moment, a pained smile on his face, before he gently cut in. "Mrs Higgins, it's so good to hear from you. Listen, we have a bit of a situation here. A... a fame emergency." He explained, in the calmest tones he could muster, about the reporters, the photographers, and their desperate need to escape unseen. There was a pause, and then Mrs Higgins’ voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper, filled with righteous indignation on their behalf. "The vultures! Don't you worry, dear boy. Of course. The back door will be unlocked in five minutes. Just be quiet, the spin cycle on number three is a bit noisy. You give that lovely girl my love, and tell her Woking is proud of her!"

The escape began. They moved with the silent, efficient teamwork of years of shared rides and shared living space. Liam grabbed a rucksack and began stuffing it with essentials: chargers, clean t-shirts, the last of a packet of biscuits. Chloe took Circe from the wall rack, her movements practiced and soundless. The trophy sat on the table, gleaming and absurd. For a second, she was tempted to leave it, to abandon the object that had caused all this chaos. But it was theirs. They had earned it. With a sigh, she wrapped it back in its towel cocoon and placed it gently in a large tote bag. Liam went first, creeping down the main stairs to the ground-floor entrance of the flats, then slipping out the back of the building's hallway into the small, shared yard that led to the laundrette. Chloe followed a minute later, wheeling Circe, her heart pounding with every creak of the floorboards. The air in the stairwell was thick with the soapy, damp-earth smell of the laundrette's utility room. This was their territory, but navigated for a completely new purpose.

Liam was waiting for her, holding the heavy utility door of Woking Suds open just a crack. They slipped inside, into the warm, humming darkness of the back room, surrounded by giant blue drums of detergent and stacks of abandoned newspapers. Through the door to the main shop, they could see the colourful churn of the washing machines and hear the low drone of the dryers. Mrs Higgins was nowhere to be seen, having granted them their privacy. Liam led the way to the rear exit, a heavy, metal-clad door secured with a simple bolt. He slid it open, and they were out, emerging into the grimy, grey light of the service alley. The air smelled of stale beer and damp cardboard. It was a world away from the stage, but at that moment, it was the most beautiful place on earth. They moved quickly down the alley, their footsteps echoing off the brick walls. The van was waiting at the far end, a battered blue sanctuary. They loaded Circe in with practiced speed, threw their bags on the seat, and climbed in. As Liam started the engine and pulled away from the kerb, Chloe risked one last look back. Far down the street, she could see the front of their building, the small crowd still staring up at their empty window, waiting for a performance that would never come. They were free. For now.The battered blue van moved through the Sunday morning streets of Woking like a ghost. Liam drove with a quiet, grim focus, his eyes constantly checking the rear-view mirror as if expecting a fleet of black cars to appear at any moment. Chloe sat rigidly in the passenger seat, her hands clenched in her lap, watching the familiar landscape of her life recede behind them. The pet shop, the library, the park where she’d first learned to ride a bike without stabilisers, each landmark felt like a piece of a past she could no longer access. They passed the sign that read ‘You are now leaving Woking’, and she felt a pang of loss so sharp and sudden it was like a physical blow. She was an exile, banished from her own kingdom by a victory she had never sought.

“Which way?” Liam asked, his voice low, as they approached the junction for the M3. It was a simple question with an impossibly complicated answer. North or south? Towards London or away from it? Towards the future or in search of the past?
“Away,” Chloe said, her voice raspy. “Just… away.”
He understood. Without another word, he guided the van onto the southbound slip road, merging into the sparse Sunday traffic. The van settled into a steady rhythm, the drone of the engine a monotonous hum that filled the silence between them. They were adrift, a tiny, self-contained capsule of bewilderment and exhaustion, hurtling down a motorway with no destination. Chloe stared out at the passing fields, the green of the home counties blurring into an anonymous smear. She felt a kinship with the landscape, a sense of being just another feature, another patch of land to be observed from a distance, her own story flattened and simplified by the speed of their passage.

An hour bled into two, and the practical necessities of their escape began to assert themselves. The fuel gauge was dipping towards the red, and the packet of biscuits Liam had grabbed was a poor substitute for a proper breakfast. He pulled into a sprawling, soulless motorway service station, a concrete island of corporate convenience. The place was bustling with a transient population of families on weekend trips and long-haul lorry drivers. For the first time, Chloe felt the chill of her new visibility. She pulled a beanie hat from her bag, tugging it low over her eyebrows, and zipped her jacket up to her chin. It felt like a flimsy, ridiculous disguise. While Liam filled the tank, she ventured inside the station’s mini-supermarket, her shoulders hunched, her gaze fixed on the floor. She moved through the aisles with the furtive urgency of a shoplifter, grabbing milk, bread, coffee, anything that felt normal. At the checkout, she kept her head down, avoiding the cashier’s eyes, her heart pounding with the irrational fear that the young woman would look up and shout, “It’s her! The girl from the telly!” But the cashier just scanned her items with bored indifference, and Chloe escaped back to the van, her breath held tight in her chest, clutching the plastic bag of groceries as if it were a hard-won prize.

Back on the road, fortified by lukewarm coffee from a machine and dry sandwiches, a fragile sense of purpose began to form. They couldn’t just drive forever. They needed a port, a place to anchor themselves while they figured out how to navigate this new, treacherous sea.
“The New Forest,” Liam said suddenly, breaking a long silence. “Remember that sportive we did? The one where it rained so hard the route markers washed away and we ended up getting completely lost?”
Chloe remembered. She remembered the bone-deep cold, the relentless, driving rain, and the misery of being soaked through. But she also remembered the moment they’d emerged from a thicket of ancient trees into a clearing, a wild pony and its foal standing motionless in the mist, their dark eyes watching them with a calm, unnerving intelligence. She remembered the feeling of being a small, insignificant part of something ancient and wild, a feeling that had dwarfed their own discomfort. “I remember the pony,” she said.
“Exactly,” Liam said, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. “It’s huge. It’s quiet. It’s full of places to disappear. We could find a campsite, a B&B. Somewhere to just… stop. Somewhere the trees outnumber the people.” He glanced at her, his expression pleading. It was more than a suggestion; it was an offering. He was trying to give her back a piece of the world they used to own, a landscape where a bicycle was not for performance, but for getting lost.

They found a small, family-run campsite on the edge of a heath, a place that in the damp chill of early spring was almost completely deserted. A handful of hardy-looking caravans were dotted amongst the gorse bushes, their windows dark. The owner, a man with a weathered face and hands stained with engine oil, barely gave them a second glance as Liam paid for two nights in cash. He pointed them towards a secluded pitch at the far end of the site, bordered by a dense copse of silver birch trees. As Liam expertly reversed the Transit into position, the crunch of the tyres on the gravel was the only sound, a welcome intrusion into the profound quiet of the forest. The air was cold and damp, smelling of wet leaves and woodsmoke. It was the smell of escape.

As dusk settled, painting the sky in soft shades of lilac and grey, the temporary relief of their flight gave way to the heavy reality of their situation. They sat in the front of the van, the engine off, the world outside growing dark. The silence stretched, filled with the weight of everything they had run from. The trophy, still wrapped in its towel, was a lump in the back, a silent accusation.
“I’m sorry, Chlo,” Liam said finally, his voice rough. He didn’t look at her, his gaze fixed on the darkening trees. “This whole thing… the application, the dare… it was a joke. It was supposed to be a laugh. I never thought… I never thought it would get this far. I never thought it would do this to you.”
The apology, so simple and direct, disarmed the knot of anger and fear in her chest. She looked at him, at his tired profile silhouetted against the fading light. He had been her biggest champion, her most fervent believer, but he was also just Liam, her friend who had a habit of letting his brilliant, terrible ideas run away with him. “It’s not your fault,” she said, and was surprised to find she meant it. “I could have said no. A hundred times, I could have said no. I went to the audition. I did the handstand. I did the skid.” She let out a long, shuddering breath. “I just didn’t know this was the prize. I thought the prize was the trophy.” She gestured vaguely towards the world outside the windscreen. “I didn’t realise it was… all this.” She looked at him, her eyes pleading for an answer he didn’t have. “What are we going to do, Liam?”Chapter 6

Liam didn’t answer for a long time, the silence stretching out until it was filled only by the whisper of the wind in the birch trees. When he finally spoke, his voice was low and gravelly, stripped of its usual easy confidence. “I don’t know,” he admitted, the three words a stark confession. He turned to face her, his eyes dark pools of exhaustion and regret in the van’s dim interior light. “I don’t have a ten-point plan for this one, Chlo. I got us into this glorious, terrifying, utterly ludicrous mess, but I have no idea how to get us out of it.” He took a deep, steadying breath, the mechanic in him instinctively searching for the first bolt to loosen. “But I know what we do first. We sleep. Right here, tonight. In the morning, I’ll make coffee on the camp stove and we’ll eat breakfast like normal people. And then,” he paused, his gaze finding hers with a flicker of the old, unwavering faith, “you ride. You take Circe out on these roads, and you just ride until you remember who you are without the lights and the cameras and the ten million people watching.”

Sleep was a fitful, shallow affair, but when Chloe woke, it was to a quiet so profound it felt like a physical presence. The frantic buzzing of the city, the shouts of the media, the roar of the crowd—all of it was gone, replaced by the gentle patter of a light rain on the van’s roof and the distant, lonely cry of a curlew. The air, when Liam slid open the side door, was shockingly cold and clean, smelling of wet earth and pine needles. He set about making coffee with a focused intensity, the hiss of the small gas stove and the rich, blooming aroma of the grounds creating a small pocket of defiant domesticity in the vast, wild landscape. They sat on the van’s bumper, wrapped in blankets, sipping the hot, bitter liquid from tin mugs, the silence between them no longer fraught with panic, but filled with a tentative, fragile peace. Chloe’s eyes kept returning to where Circe leaned against a tree, her skeletal frame looking both alien and perfectly at home in the rustic setting. The idea of riding felt daunting, a violation of the stillness, but Liam’s words from the night before echoed in her mind. *You ride until you remember who you are.*

After a breakfast of dry toast and more coffee, she knew she couldn’t put it off any longer. She changed into her cycling gear, the familiar ritual of pulling on the padded shorts and zipping up the jersey a comforting act of muscle memory. Liam handed her the bike, his hands lingering for a second on the handlebars. He didn’t say a word, but his eyes said everything. *You’ve got this.* She clipped in, the click echoing in the quiet campsite, and pushed off. The tyres crunched on the gravel path before hitting the slick, wet tarmac of the narrow country lane. The road was everything the studio floor was not: it was uneven, littered with fallen leaves and slick with rain, its surface a patchwork of mended cracks and potholes. It was honest. Every jolt, every patch of resistance, travelled up through the frame and into her body, a constant, truthful dialogue between her and the world. She pedalled harder, leaning into the burn, the wind a raw, damp cloth against her face. The landscape opened up, a watercolour wash of brooding heathland and ancient, skeletal trees. There was no finish line, no X on the floor, no audience. There was only the road ahead.

She rode for over an hour, following the twisting lanes with no destination in mind, letting her body take over. She climbed a short, vicious hill that left her lungs screaming, the fire in her quads a clean, purifying pain. As she crested the top, she saw them. A small herd of New Forest ponies stood by the side of the road, their coats shaggy and dark with rain. They were completely still, their heads lowered as they grazed on the tough winter grass, steam rising from their nostrils in the cold air. Chloe slowed to a stop, unclipping one foot but remaining on the saddle, watching them. One of them, a mare with a tangled, matted mane and deep, intelligent eyes, lifted her head and looked directly at her. There was no curiosity in her gaze, no expectation, just a calm, placid acknowledgement of her presence. The pony regarded her and Circe for a long moment, an equal inhabitant of this wild, wet world, then dismissed her as uninteresting and returned to her grazing. In that simple, profound moment of being seen and then ignored by a creature utterly indifferent to her existence, something inside Chloe shifted. The weight of being ‘Chloe Ashton, Winner of Britain’s Best’ lifted, blown away by the forest wind. She was just a woman on a bicycle, a temporary, fleeting shape in a landscape that had existed for thousands of years before her and would exist for thousands of years after.

The ride back to the campsite was different. The rhythm of her pedalling felt easier, her body lighter. The fire in her legs was simply a feeling, not a metaphor for ambition or fear. She was tired, muddy, and soaked through, but she felt more herself than she had at any point since she’d stepped onto that stage. When she rolled back into their secluded pitch, Liam was waiting, a fresh mug of coffee in his hand. He’d cleaned the van, organised their meagre supplies, and wiped the mud from the trophy’s canvas bag. He was building a new normal for them, one small, practical act at a time. He looked at her face, at the streaks of mud on her cheeks and the calm clarity that had returned to her eyes, and a slow smile spread across his face. He didn’t need to ask if the ride had worked. He simply handed her the warm mug. “Good,” he said, a world of relief in that single word.

They sat for a long time, watching the rain ease and the sun begin to break through the clouds, casting long, dramatic shadows across the heath. The oppressive weight of the question ‘what now?’ had been replaced by a quiet readiness to find an answer.
“Okay,” Liam said, finally breaking the silence, his voice infused with a new, strategic energy. “Running was step one. Hiding is step two. But there has to be a step three. We can’t just disappear forever. That story will write itself, and it won’t be the one we want.” He leaned forward, the mechanic’s mind fully engaged, breaking their life down into a problem that could be solved. “We need to take control of the narrative. No more hiding. We speak. Once. But we do it on our terms. Not the Woking Gazette, not some tabloid sleaze. We find one person, the right person—a proper journalist, maybe from a cycling magazine, someone who gets it—and we tell them the real story. The whole story. From the pizza to the skid.”

The idea, which would have filled her with terror just that morning, now felt logical, even necessary. Silence was a vacuum, and the world would rush to fill it with its own assumptions and lies. Speaking up was not an act of surrender to her new fame, but an act of defiance against it. “And the money?” she asked, the hundred-thousand-pound question that still felt like a piece of abstract fiction.
“The money is our shield,” he said, his eyes gleaming with the thrill of the plan. “It buys us time. It buys us freedom. It buys us a new Woking Wheels. Not just a new coffee machine, a whole new shop. We buy a bigger premises, somewhere with a proper workshop and space for a sofa. We build our own fortress, a community hub, a place that’s ours, that no one can touch. We use their prize to build a wall against them.”
It was a breathtakingly audacious plan, to take the winnings from the machine and use it to build a life completely independent of it. It reframed the money not as a corrupting prize, but as a tool of liberation. It was a purpose. A path forward.

A decision settled in the quiet air between them. It wasn't a solution to everything, but it was a start. They were no longer running. They were regrouping. They would stay in the forest for another day, maybe two. Chloe would think, she would write down what she wanted to say, finding the words to describe her art without cheapening it. Liam would do the research, find the right journalist, and make the call. He stood up and stretched, looking out at the vast, open expanse of the New Forest, its wild beauty no longer a hiding place, but a training ground. “Right then,” he said, his voice ringing with a purpose that had been absent for days. “First things first. Let’s get a proper map. If we’re going to fight a war, we need to know the lay of the land.”Their war room was the cramped, cold cabin of the Ford Transit. The ‘map’ turned out to be a large, beautifully detailed Ordnance Survey map of the New Forest, purchased along with a flask, two packets of Jaffa Cakes, and a local newspaper during a tense, cloak-and-dagger mission to a small shop in Lyndhurst. Chloe had stayed in the van, the beanie pulled low, her heart hammering every time a customer glanced in the direction of the van. Liam had returned with their supplies and a report: “No one looked twice. I’m just a bloke buying biscuits.” The small victory felt disproportionately huge, a confirmation that in the quiet corners of the country, anonymity could still, for now, be found. Back at the campsite, they spread the paper map across the dashboard, its intricate web of contour lines and public footpaths a reassuring testament to a world that could be navigated and understood. It represented the freedom of the physical world, a stark contrast to the chaotic, unmappable territory of the internet they now had to chart.

While Chloe traced the tiny, winding roads on the map with her finger, planning rides she might never take, Liam initiated the second phase of his plan. He sat in the passenger seat, his laptop balanced precariously on his knees, tethering it to his phone’s data connection. The moment the connection went live, the machine came alive with a fusillade of pings and pop-ups, a digital assault from the world they had fled. He grimaced, methodically closing windows, swatting away notifications, and navigating the storm with a grim determination. He wasn’t browsing; he was hunting. He bypassed the major news outlets and sports sites, their headlines already screaming variations of ‘Woking’s Wheelie Wonderful Winner!’ and instead delved into the niche, quiet corners of cycling journalism. He muttered to himself as he worked, a running commentary of dismissal. “No, they’ll want a gear review… ‘The British Bike-Ballet Star’s Surprising Secret’? Forget it… Clickbait, clickbait, clickbait…”

Chloe left him to his work, retreating to the back of the van with a cheap notebook and a biro she’d found in the glovebox. The task of articulating her ‘why’ felt more daunting than any physical feat she had ever attempted on Circe. Words were not her medium. She was fluent in the language of balance, momentum, and friction, but the vocabulary of emotion and intent felt foreign and clumsy. She started by trying to describe the feeling of a perfect handstand, but the words that came out—‘hard’, ‘balanced’, ‘strong’—were flat and technical, devoid of the magic. They were the words of a mechanic, not an artist. Frustrated, she scribbled them out. She tried again, this time closing her eyes, not thinking, but feeling. She pictured the industrial estate at 4:30 AM. She wrote about the colour of the sky just before dawn, that specific, metallic grey. She wrote about the hum of the tyre on perfect tarmac, a sound that vibrated not in her ears but in her bones. She wrote about the cold air, the burn in her legs, and the profound, peaceful loneliness of being the only moving thing in a sleeping world. She wasn’t writing a press statement; she was writing a confession.

An hour later, Liam let out a soft sound of triumph. “Found her,” he said. Chloe looked up from her notebook, which was now filled with crossed-out sentences and a few, hard-won paragraphs. “Found who?” she asked. “Eleanor Vance,” Liam said, turning the laptop towards her. On the screen was an article from a small, beautifully designed online journal called ‘The Cadence’. The headline was simple: ‘The Ghost Bike: Memory and Momentum on the Streets of London’. The article wasn't about a race or a celebrity. It was a quiet, contemplative piece about the culture of fixed-gear messengers, the artistry of their movement through traffic, and the poignant, white-painted ‘ghost bikes’ that marked the spots where cyclists had fallen. The writing was elegant, empathetic, and deeply knowledgeable. It understood that a bicycle could be more than a machine; it could be a partner, a tool, a memorial, a paintbrush. The author’s bio was short: ‘Eleanor Vance is a freelance journalist and former courier who writes about the places where cycling and culture intersect.’

Chloe read the entire article, her breath catching in her throat. Eleanor Vance understood. She understood the pact with momentum, the dance with danger, the strange poetry of moving through a city on a machine with no brakes. This was not a person who would ask about her tearful journey or what she planned to do with the money. This was a person who might ask about the feeling of the gyroscopic pull of the spinning back wheel during a handstand. “Her,” Chloe said, her voice full of a certainty that surprised her. “It has to be her.” Liam nodded, his face grimly satisfied. “My thoughts exactly. She’s freelance, respected but not famous. She values the story, not the headline. She’s our best shot.”

Crafting the email was their final collaboration of the day. Liam typed, but Chloe dictated the core of the message, pulling phrases from her own messy, heartfelt notes. They didn't offer an exclusive or mention money. They simply introduced themselves and explained that they had a story they felt only she might understand. They wrote about the difference between a sport and a ritual, between performance and confession. Liam added a final, protective line: ‘This would be a single conversation, on our terms, at a time and place of our choosing. If this isn't something that interests you, we will respect that and not trouble you again.’ He read the entire draft aloud, the words sounding strange and formal in the cramped confines of the van. “Ready?” he asked, his finger hovering over the mouse. Chloe looked from the laptop screen to the darkening forest outside, then back to Liam’s steady, determined face. This was it. The first step back into the world, not as victims of the storm, but as navigators attempting to chart their own course through it. She took a deep breath and gave a single, sharp nod. Liam clicked ‘Send’. The email vanished into the ether. They sat in the sudden, profound silence of the van, the only sound the gentle ticking of the engine as it cooled. They had cast their message in a bottle out into the vast, turbulent ocean of the internet. Now, all they could do was wait.Chapter 7

The click of the mouse was a sound both infinitesimally small and deafeningly loud. It was the closing of a door, the casting of a stone, the launching of a fragile paper boat into a storm. Liam closed the laptop with a quiet finality, and the sudden darkness of the screen plunged the van’s cabin into the soft, grey twilight of the forest. They sat in the silence, the energy of their decision slowly dissipating, leaving a vacuum of pure, unadulterated suspense in its place. They had reached out from their self-imposed exile, deliberately poked the world they had run from, and invited one of its emissaries into their midst. The fear that had been a frantic, chaotic thing was now distilled into a single, sharp point: what if they had chosen wrong? What if Eleanor Vance was just a more articulate version of the vultures who had besieged their flat, her elegant prose just a more sophisticated trap? The quiet of the New Forest no longer felt like a sanctuary; it felt like the breathless hush before a verdict.

The next twenty-four hours were a masterclass in controlled agony. Time, which had blurred into a meaningless continuum on the motorway, now slowed to a crawl, each minute stretching into an eternity of waiting. Every flicker of a bird in the trees outside the window, every rustle of leaves, made them jump. Liam’s phone remained off, but Chloe found herself unable to resist the temptation, turning hers on for brief, furtive checks. The onslaught of notifications was immediate and overwhelming, a digital scream she quickly silenced, but not before her heart leapt at the sight of the email icon, only to be dashed when it was just junk mail or a notification from her bank. They tried to act normal. Liam meticulously organised his toolbox. Chloe re-read the paragraphs in her notebook until the words started to lose their meaning. They talked in fits and starts, their conversation circling the unspoken anxiety, never quite touching it, discussing the weather, the merits of different brands of camp stove fuel, anything but the one thing that consumed them.

By the second morning, the waiting had become an unbearable, physical presence in the van. Chloe felt a desperate, clawing need to move, to outrun the static anxiety that had taken root in her bones. While Liam was hunched over the OS map, pretending to plan a walking route, she pulled on her gear, the familiar fabric a second skin of purpose. This time, the ride was not an escape from something, but a preparation for it. She wheeled Circe out onto the damp lane and pushed off, the cold air a bracing shock. As she pedalled, the forest unfolding around her in shades of mossy green and damp brown, she rehearsed her story. She spoke it aloud to the empty road, her words snatched away by the wind. She told the silent, watching trees about the weightlessness of the handstand, the controlled violence of the skid-stop, the secret language between her muscles and the machine. She wasn't practicing a speech; she was reclaiming her own memories from the glare of the spotlights, finding their true shape and weight in the solitude that had forged them. She rode until the burn in her legs was a familiar, comforting friend and the words in her head felt less like a defence and more like a simple statement of fact. This is what I do. This is who I am.

While Chloe was out mapping her own narrative onto the forest roads, Liam waged his own quiet war against uncertainty. He couldn’t ride, but he could work. He unhooked Circe’s spare wheelset from the inside of the van and, with the precision of a surgeon, began a full service. He laid out a canvas sheet on the ground and meticulously disassembled the hubs, cleaning each bearing with a small, degreaser-soaked rag, his movements economical and absorbed. This was his territory, a world of measurable tolerances and predictable mechanics. He checked the spoke tension, plucking each one like a harp string, listening for the pure, true note that signified strength and integrity. He was not just tinkering; he was armouring them. He was ensuring that their most crucial piece of evidence, the co-star of the entire drama, was in perfect condition. It was an act of faith, a quiet vote of confidence that there would be an interview, and that every detail would matter.

When Chloe returned, flushed with cold and exertion, she found Liam wiping the last trace of grease from his hands, the wheelset gleaming beside him like a pair of silver shields. The atmosphere in their small camp had subtly shifted. The frantic edge of their anxiety had been worn down by their respective rituals, replaced by a quiet, stoic readiness. They shared a thermos of tea, the comfortable silence returning, the unspoken question hanging less heavily between them. They agreed, without needing to say it, to one final check before they allowed themselves to accept defeat for the day. Liam booted up the laptop, the process feeling slow and momentous. The email program opened. Chloe’s heart did a familiar, painful lurch. There was the usual spam, a few alerts from social media he’d forgotten to disable, and then, nestled amongst the junk, a single, plainly titled email. Sender: Eleanor Vance. Subject: Re: A Conversation.

Liam read it aloud, his voice low and steady, each word falling into the quiet of the van like a carefully placed stone. It was short, professional, and devoid of any cloying sentiment. "Dear Mr. Davies and Ms. Ashton," it began, the formal address a strangely reassuring sign of respect. "Thank you for your message. I remember your performance. I also remember the London courier scene in the late nineties. I understand the difference between riding for a living, riding for a crowd, and riding for yourself. I am interested in your story." Chloe let out a breath she didn’t realise she had been holding for two days. The final paragraph was the one that sealed it. "I agree to your terms. A single conversation, to be recorded only by my own notebook. You choose the time and the place. Let me know where and when, and I will be there." It was a simple, unambiguous acceptance. The relief was so sudden and so total that Chloe felt light-headed, slumping back against the van seat as Liam finished reading. They had cast their message in a bottle and a hand had reached out from the storm to pluck it from the waves.

The elation was quickly replaced by the sharp, tactical focus of the next move. Now they had to choose their ground. This was their one chance to control the environment, to build a stage of their own. Liam, ever the pragmatist, suggested a quiet pub on the far side of the forest, somewhere with a discreet corner and a decent lunch menu. But Chloe, emboldened by her ride and the validation of Eleanor’s email, shook her head. She leaned over the dashboard and pointed to the OS map, her finger landing on a spot marked with the small, gothic lettering of a landmark. “Here,” she said. “Fritham Plain. There’s a Bronze Age barrow up there, on the ridge. You can see for miles in every direction. There are no walls, no corners, no one can approach without you seeing them from half a mile away.” It was a place of ancient history and vast, open skies. A place where secrets felt impossible. It was the antithesis of a clandestine meeting in a shadowy room. It was a statement. We have nothing to hide.

Liam looked from the map to her face, a slow, admiring smile spreading across his features. "A Bronze Age barrow," he repeated, savouring the audacity of it. "You want to hold a press conference on a 4,000-year-old grave. You're a lunatic. It's perfect." He turned back to the laptop, his fingers poised over the keyboard, a new energy crackling between them. This was not the frightened, furtive email of their first contact. This was an invitation. He drafted the reply, proposing the location and a time – midday, the following day. There was no hesitation this time, no fear. As he clicked 'Send', a sense of profound and thrilling clarity settled over them. They were no longer hiding in the forest. They were using it as their base of operations. They had an ally, a location, and a story to tell. The escape was over. The counter-attack was about to begin.The waiting, this time, was different. It was not the gnawing, passive anxiety of the previous day, but a taut, purposeful stillness, the quiet hum of an engine idling before a race. There was a plan, a destination, a single objective, and it imbued their every action with a new sense of deliberateness. Liam cleaned their small camp stove with a focused intensity, scrubbing the metal until it shone, an act of creating order in their small, mobile world. Chloe took their few clothes, folding them into neat, compact squares, a simple, grounding ritual that felt like packing for a campaign rather than a retreat. They were no longer flotsam tossed on a chaotic sea; they were the builders of a raft, however small and precarious it might be, and they were preparing to set their own course. The silence in the van was no longer one of fear, but of shared, unspoken resolve.

The reply from Eleanor Vance arrived less than an hour after they had sent their proposal, a testament to her professionalism that sent a jolt of relief through them both. It was as crisp and economical as her first message. "Fritham Plain at midday tomorrow is confirmed," Liam read from the laptop screen, his voice even. "I appreciate the choice of location. I will come alone. For practical purposes, please let me know the make and colour of your vehicle. I will be in a dark green Subaru Forester." The simple, practical details of the exchange—a car model, a colour—acted as a powerful anchor, dragging their abstract, audacious plan into the realm of concrete reality. This was happening. A journalist was going to drive to a Bronze Age burial mound in the middle of the New Forest to meet two fugitives from fame in a battered Ford Transit. The sheer, magnificent absurdity of it almost made Chloe laugh. It was a terrible idea, born of desperation and pizza grease, that had finally flowered into something that felt strangely, powerfully right.

Chloe was awake long before the sun, her body’s internal clock still set to the pre-dawn schedule of a cyclist. In the past, this was the time for the hard work, for building the strength and stamina that had, paradoxically, led her to this point. But on this crucial morning, she knew she did not need a punishing ride. The work to be done was of a different nature. While Liam, ever the quartermaster, quietly busied himself making coffee and checking the van’s oil and tyres, Chloe attended to Circe. She didn't service the bike—Liam had already seen to that with a mechanic's precision—but groomed it. With a soft cloth, she meticulously wiped down every inch of the frame, polishing the matte black finish until it absorbed the pale morning light. She cleaned the chain, link by link, and wiped the fine layer of road dust from the saddle. This was not maintenance; it was a conversation, a quiet act of respect for her silent partner. Circe was not just an apparatus; she was a co-conspirator and the primary evidence in their case. She had to look the part.

As they packed up their minimal camp, the question of the trophy arose. It sat on the passenger seat, still swaddled in its towel, a lumpen, awkward presence. It was the reason for all this, the glittering symbol of her victory and the catalyst for her exile. For a moment, Chloe considered bringing it, unveiling it on the barrow as a piece of dramatic evidence. But the thought felt cheap, theatrical. It belonged to the world of the show, of sequins and sob stories, not to the raw, windy honesty of the heathland. "No," she said, shaking her head as Liam went to pick it up. "We leave it. This isn't about what I won. It's about how I did it." Liam paused, then a slow grin of understanding spread across his face. He nodded, stowing the wrapped prize under a blanket in the back of the van, burying the gilded proof of her success. They were choosing their own narrative, and it was a story of craft, not prizes.

The drive to Fritham Plain was a slow, deliberate ascent. They left the sheltered woodland behind, the roads narrowing and climbing until they emerged onto a vast, high plateau. The landscape was stark and beautiful, a sweeping panorama of purple heather and tough, golden grasses flattened by a wind that rocked the van on its suspension. The sky felt immense, a domed lid of churning grey clouds that seemed to touch the horizon in every direction. It was a place that dwarfed human concerns, where 4,000 years of history were buried just beneath the turf. When they finally reached the small, gravel car park near the designated barrow, it was deserted. They were an hour early. Liam parked the Transit with its nose pointing towards the single track they had driven up, a habit from a life of quick getaways he had not yet unlearned. He got out a pair of binoculars and began to scan the horizon, a nervous, modern-day watchman on an ancient hill.

Chloe took Circe from the van. The wind hit her with a physical force, a wild, cleansing blast that tore at her hair and clothes. She walked the bike up the gentle, grassy slope to the top of the barrow, the highest point on the plain. From here, she could see everything. The world was laid out before her, a map of greens and browns under a vast, restless sky. She stood with her hand resting on Circe’s saddle, the bike a familiar anchor in the gale, and she felt a profound sense of calm settle over her. She was not hiding. She was not trapped. She was standing in the open, in a place of her own choosing, ready to meet the world on her own terms. She felt the wind on her face, the solid ground beneath her feet, and the quiet, steady presence of her bicycle beside her, and she knew she was ready.

Right on time, a dark speck appeared on the distant road, growing slowly, steadily larger. It was a dark green Subaru, its sensible, rugged form looking perfectly at home in the wild landscape. The car pulled into the gravel car park and stopped a respectful distance from their van. For a long moment, nothing happened. Then, the driver’s door opened, and a woman emerged. She was not what Chloe had pictured. She was tall and lean, with short, practical dark hair whipped by the wind. She wore not a suit, but dark trousers, sturdy walking boots, and a worn, waterproof jacket. She carried no briefcase, no large camera, just a small, spiral-bound notebook and a pen that she shielded in her palm. She stood by her car for a moment, taking in the scene—the battered van, the man with the binoculars, and the woman with the bicycle standing sentinel on the ancient mound. Then, with a purposeful stride, she began to walk up the slope. She approached Chloe directly, her gaze clear and analytical, moving from Chloe’s face to the machine standing beside her. She stopped a few feet away, her eyes resting on the clean lines of the frame. Her first words were not a greeting or a platitude. They were an observation, spoken with the quiet authority of an expert. "That's a beautiful frame," she said, her voice clear and carrying easily on the wind. "No brake mounts. You weren't kidding."Chapter 8

The words, stripped of sentiment and delivered with the simple authority of fact, were a key turning a lock deep inside Chloe. All the fear, the defensiveness, the carefully rehearsed justifications she had prepared, they all just dissolved in the face of that one, expert observation. This woman wasn’t here to dissect a celebrity; she was here to talk about a bicycle. Chloe felt a smile, a real, unforced one, touch her lips for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. “Thank you,” she said, her own voice sounding surprisingly steady against the wind. “She’s a custom build. Liam put her together for me years ago.” At the mention of his name, Liam, who had been lingering at the base of the mound, began the slow walk up the slope to join them. He didn't crowd her, but stood a few feet away, his arms crossed, a silent, watchful guardian to their conversation.

Eleanor Vance gave a small nod, her gaze sharp and intelligent. “I can see the work,” she said, her eyes tracing the clean, unadorned lines of the frame. She didn’t pull out her notebook immediately. Instead, she just stood there, letting the silence hang in the air, creating a space rather than demanding it be filled. It was a journalist’s trick, but it felt less like a tactic and more like a genuine courtesy, an invitation for the story to begin on its own terms. Chloe took a deep breath of the cold, clean air, a lungful of courage. She began, not with the auditions or the flashing lights, but with the only place that made sense. “It starts in the dark,” she said, her voice quiet but clear. “On the industrial estate loop in Woking. It’s a three-mile circuit of perfect, soulless tarmac. At 4:30 in the morning, it’s just me, and her, and the sound the tyres make. That’s where this all comes from. Not the stage.”

As Chloe spoke, Eleanor finally opened her notebook, her pen beginning to move across the page in a quick, efficient shorthand. Liam, seeing Chloe relax into her own story, stepped forward slightly. "And it ends up on national television because of me," he interjected, his voice carrying a note of wry self-deprecation. "It was my stupid idea. A dare, over a greasy pizza, while we were watching the show and making fun of it. I filled out the form as a joke. I never, for a second, thought they'd understand. I never thought it would lead to… all this." He gestured vaguely at the wide, open space around them, a landscape that had become their refuge from the consequences of his joke. He was taking ownership of the mess, leaving Chloe free to explain the art.

Eleanor listened, her expression unreadable, her pen never ceasing its quiet scratching. When Liam finished, she didn't comment on the dare. Instead, her focus returned entirely to Chloe. "The handstand," she said, her question direct and technical. "You're holding your entire body weight on the bars, but the bike is still in motion. What's your anchor? What's the point of focus?" The question was so specific, so insightful, it caught Chloe by surprise. This was the language she understood. "The back wheel," Chloe answered immediately, the explanation flowing out of her now with an easy confidence. "It’s still spinning. It acts as a gyroscope. It wants to stay upright. I'm not fighting the bike; I’m finding an equilibrium with it. The anchor isn't a point on the ground, it's the momentum itself. I just have to trust it."

For the next hour, under the vast, churning sky of the New Forest, they talked. Or rather, Chloe and Liam talked, and Eleanor listened, her occasional questions acting like a skilled mechanic’s wrench, precisely targeting a specific area and gently loosening a story that had been seized up with fear and confusion. She asked about the physical toll, the years of building the specific muscle groups needed to resist the bike's forward motion. She asked about the mental discipline of riding brakeless in unpredictable environments. She never once asked how it felt to get a standing ovation, but she did ask how it felt to land the final, perfect skid-stop. Chloe found herself explaining the science of the isopropanol, the calculated risk, the feeling of absolute control in a moment that looked like pure, chaotic violence. She was translating her body's knowledge into words, and in doing so, was hearing her own story, clear and true, for the first time.

Finally, as a squall of rain began to sweep across the plain from the west, Eleanor Vance stopped writing and closed her notebook. The quiet snap of the spiral binding felt like a conclusion. She looked from Chloe to Liam, then back to Chloe, and a flicker of something that looked like profound respect showed in her eyes. "Thank you," she said, her tone formal but sincere. "You've given me more than enough. The story won't be about the TV show. It will be about the work. It will be about the ride." She offered her hand, first to Chloe and then to Liam. Her handshake was firm, her skin cold from the wind. There were no false promises of fame or future contact, just a simple, professional courtesy that felt more valuable than any gushing praise.

They stood on top of the ancient barrow and watched as she walked back down the slope, her figure leaning into the wind. She got into her Subaru without a backward glance, started the engine, and drove away, her car a diminishing speck on the long, empty road. When she was gone, there was only the sound of the wind whistling over the heath and the distant cry of a bird. Liam let out a long, slow breath he seemed to have been holding for the entire hour. He turned to Chloe, his face etched with a relief so profound it looked like exhaustion. "She got it," he said, his voice quiet with awe. "She actually got it." Chloe nodded, her throat too tight to speak. She looked out at the vast, wild landscape, at the rain now falling in earnest, washing the world clean. A single, heavy weight she hadn't even realised she was carrying, the burden of being misunderstood, had been lifted. The wind was just the wind again. The rain was just the rain. She was just Chloe Ashton, a cyclist, and she had finally told her story. The counter-attack was complete. Now, they could go home.The journey back was a mirror image of their escape, but with the emotional landscape inverted. Where the drive south had been a frantic, desperate flight into the unknown, the drive north was a quiet, deliberate return. They were no longer refugees. They were soldiers heading back to base, the primary engagement over, the next phase of the campaign ready to begin. The motorway was no longer a faceless symbol of escape but a simple ribbon of tarmac, a means to an end. As the wild, open heathland of the New Forest gave way to the manicured verges and dense, repeating patterns of the London commuter belt, Chloe did not feel the old, familiar sense of being trapped. She watched the suburban sprawl of Woking draw closer not as a cage, but as her territory, the place her story was rooted, a landscape she was now returning to reclaim.

They turned onto their street with a shared, held breath. The circus had not entirely left town, but it had dwindled. The large satellite van was gone, as were the jostling reporters. In their place stood a single, persistent photographer, leaning against a lamp post across the street, his long lens a lazy, hopeful appendage. A few of their neighbours, out walking dogs or washing cars, pointedly ignored him, a small, unspoken act of local solidarity. Liam didn’t hunt for a discreet parking spot. He pulled the battered Transit directly into its usual place outside the laundrette with a confident, final motion, the sigh of the handbrake a declaration of their return. He killed the engine and they sat for a moment in the sudden silence, observing the lone photographer who was now lifting his camera with a renewed sense of purpose. "Let him take his picture," Liam said, his voice devoid of its earlier anger, replaced by a weary pragmatism. "It's the last one he's getting for free."

Climbing the stairs to their flat was like walking back in time. The faint, clean scent of fabric softener from Woking Suds was the same, a constant in their chaotic world. Liam turned the key in the lock, the sound no longer a betrayal of the pre-dawn quiet but a firm, definitive statement of re-entry. Inside, the flat was a perfect, preserved diorama of their panic. Two half-full glasses of champagne sat on the table, the liquid inside now flat and lifeless. The empty coffee bag lay on the counter next to a scattering of biscuit crumbs. It was the scene of a hurried evacuation, and the sight of it brought the memory of their fear rushing back, sharp and potent. Without a word, Chloe picked up the glasses and emptied them into the sink, rinsing them clean. Liam gathered the rubbish and tied the bin bag with a firm knot. It was a silent, synchronised act of restoration, of clearing away the debris of the old battle to make way for the new.

Once the flat was restored to a semblance of its usual cluttered order, they faced the final frontier. Liam placed his phone and Chloe's on the kitchen table. They were inert, silent rectangles, repositories of a world of noise they had successfully shut out. "Ready?" he asked, his tone neutral. It wasn't a question of fear anymore, but of practicality. Chloe nodded. They powered them on simultaneously. The screens lit up, and the inevitable digital barrage began. A torrent of notifications, missed calls, voicemails, and messages flooded in. But this time, it was different. Seen from the quiet calm of their reclaimed home, the digital screaming seemed distant and pathetic. It was just noise, a frantic, meaningless storm in a teacup they were no longer sailing in. Chloe scrolled past the headlines about her 'mysterious disappearance' with a strange sense of detachment. They were writing fiction about a character she no longer inhabited. “They have no idea, do they?” she said, a small, genuine smile on her face. Liam, scrolling through his own feed, grunted in agreement. "Not yet they don't. But Eleanor Vance's article is a time bomb. When it drops, it's going to blow all this nonsense out of the water."

With the digital world acknowledged and then firmly put in its place, their focus shifted entirely to the future. Liam pulled a notepad towards him, the same one he used for logging bike repairs, and uncapped a pen. "Right," he said, the strategist taking over completely. "Woking Wheels 2.0. The first thing we need is a business plan. A proper one. The bank won't just hand over Chloe Ashton’s Big Bag of Cash without seeing some numbers." He started scribbling, his handwriting a messy, energetic scrawl. "Premises. I saw that old hardware shop on Goldsworth Road is still empty. It's twice the size of our current place, has a big stockroom, and a proper storefront window, not just a door and a prayer." Chloe leaned over the table, the fear and exhaustion of the past week replaced by a rising tide of excitement. The abstract idea of a new shop was suddenly taking on the concrete form of a specific street, a specific building. "And a workshop with enough room to swing a cat," she added, her voice full of longing. "With space for a proper wheel-truing stand that isn't crammed next to the kettle." Liam grinned, his pen flying across the page. "And a sofa," he said, underlining the word twice. "For customers. And a proper Italian coffee machine. For us." They were no longer just dreaming. They were planning. They were taking the chaotic, terrifying prize money and forging it, piece by piece, into the exact shape of their own future.The week that followed their return was a strange, quiet purgatory. The lone photographer, having captured his mundane shot of them unloading groceries from the van, finally packed up his long lens and departed, his departure leaving a conspicuous void on the street. The frantic ringing of the landline subsided, replaced by an expectant silence that felt just as loud. They existed in a liminal state, the old life over, the new one not yet begun, the entire future balanced on the point of a journalist’s pen. They filled the void with work. Their laptops, once portals to a terrifying digital storm, became tools of creation. They ignored the trending topics and instead spent hours on the council’s planning portal, deciphering zoning laws and commercial lease agreements. The prize money, a number so large and abstract it looked like a software glitch, appeared in Chloe’s modest bank account, and its silent, potent presence transformed their pipe dreams into a list of actionable objectives.

One grey, overcast afternoon, they made a pilgrimage to Goldsworth Road. The old hardware shop stood on a corner, its large, plate-glass windows opaque with years of grime, the faded ghost of a ‘Ronseal’ advert still visible on the peeling paint of the door. To any passer-by, it was a derelict, forgotten space. To them, it was the blueprint of their future. They pressed their faces to the dirty glass, peering into the cavernous, dusty interior. The air inside smelled of old plaster and damp. Liam, his voice muffled by the window, began to map out their kingdom. “That’s the main showroom,” he said, pointing to the large open space. “We’ll sand the floors back, get all this natural light. Racks along that wall. And back there…” he pointed towards the dark, cavernous rear of the shop, “that’s the workshop. Double the size of what we have now. Room for two work stands, a wheel-truing station, all the tools mounted on the wall…” Chloe listened, her own imagination filling in the details he left out. She could see the space transformed, clean and bright, smelling of new rubber and fresh coffee. She pictured a small seating area by the window with a well-worn sofa, sunlight streaming in, the hum of happy customers mingling with the click of a freewheel. It was the first time since the dare over pizza that the future had felt not like a threat, but like a thrilling, tangible promise.

Chloe reclaimed her mornings with a quiet determination. The 4:30 AM alarm was no longer an escape from the day, but the start of it. She slipped out into the familiar, sleeping streets, the air crisp and still. The industrial estate loop greeted her like an old friend. The ritual was the same—the initial burn, the search for the perfect cadence, the metronomic tick of her own heart—but something fundamental within her had shifted. She was no longer whispering a secret confession to the town; she was making a quiet, confident declaration. The hairline cracks in the pavement, the oil stains outside the kebab shop, they were the punctuation marks in her own story, a story she was no longer afraid to tell. She rode with a new power, a sense of ownership over not just her bike, but her own narrative. The body in motion was the same, but the mind was no longer in hiding. It was preparing.

The email arrived on a Thursday morning, with no fanfare. Liam was making toast when his laptop, sitting open on the kitchen table, chimed with a single, polite notification. The subject line was stark: "Live." The body of the email contained nothing but a hyperlink. They abandoned the toast and huddled around the small screen, a silent, two-person congregation. Liam clicked the link. The clean, minimalist page of ‘The Cadence’ loaded, displaying a single, powerful black and white photograph of Circe’s rear wheel, the faint black skid-mark from the finale clearly visible on the tyre, a proud scar. The headline was not the sensationalist trash they had feared, but something elegant and profound: "The Work: Chloe Ashton and the Physics of Flying."

They read the article together, their shoulders touching, the scent of burning toast from the kitchen completely forgotten. Eleanor Vance had kept her word, and then some. She had crafted their jumbled, emotional story into a piece of sharp, empathetic prose that was as beautifully engineered as a bicycle frame. She used their words from the barrow, weaving a narrative that began in the pre-dawn solitude of Woking and ended not with a trophy, but with the quiet, gyroscopic hum of a spinning wheel. The TV show was mentioned only as a bizarre, noisy interruption to a decade of private, devotional practice. She wrote of the pact between muscle and machine, of the science of the skid, of the unique, lonely artistry of the fixed-gear rider. She hadn't just reported their story; she had understood it, translated it, and honoured it. As Chloe read her own words, filtered through Eleanor’s respectful lens, she felt a profound sense of being seen, not as a winner or a celebrity, but as an artisan. It was a vindication so complete it felt like a physical release, a knot of tension she had carried for weeks finally unspooling.

The article was a stone dropped into a pond, and the ripples began almost immediately. The first phone call was not from a tabloid, but from Chloe’s father. His voice was thick with an emotion she had rarely heard from him. "I just read it, Chlo," he said. "The article. I... I get it now. The early mornings, the scraped knees. It's... it's your work. I'm so proud of you." Later that day, an email arrived with the subject "Collaboration?". It was from a small, highly respected British frame builder whose work Liam had revered for years. He had read the piece and was impressed by their "commitment to the integrity of the machine" and wanted to discuss the possibility of creating a limited edition "Circe" frame. The noise from the outside world had not stopped, but its very nature, its tone and texture, had fundamentally changed. The frantic, gossipy chatter was being replaced by a low, respectful hum of conversation from a world they actually wanted to be a part of. The story was no longer about them; it belonged to them again.

That evening, the laptops were put away. The newspapers were ignored. In the centre of their small living room floor, they unrolled a large sheet of lining paper, salvaged from the hardware shop project. Liam, on his hands and knees, began to sketch a detailed floor plan of their future, his pen moving with a newfound confidence. Chloe, lying on her stomach beside him, made notes in the margins, listing suppliers for handlebar tape and suggesting the perfect corner for the coffee machine. The ridiculous, oversized trophy, which had been hidden away since their return, was finally unwrapped and placed on the mantelpiece. It no longer looked like an alien object or a symbol of a life hijacked. In the warm light of the flat, it gleamed with the quiet, potent promise of seed capital. They were no longer running, no longer hiding, no longer fighting. They were building. The glorious, terrifying, utterly ludicrous mess was over. The work was just beginning.Chapter 9

The meeting with Marcus Thorne was not held in a boardroom, but in a place that smelled of brazing flux and linseed oil. His workshop, a converted Nissen hut tucked away in the heart of rural Wiltshire, was a cathedral of steel tubing and hand-filed lugs. He was a man in his late sixties with hands that were a roadmap of small scars and calloused knuckles, and he greeted them not with the deference one might show a television star, but with the quiet, appraising eye of a master craftsman sizing up a new piece of metal. He gestured for Chloe to bring Circe inside, and for ten minutes, he simply walked around the bike, his fingers tracing the welds and the precise angles of the frame Liam had built. He didn’t speak a word, but Liam watched him, his expression a mixture of acute terror and profound reverence, as if a god of his own religion were judging his life’s work. Finally, Marcus straightened up, looked at Liam, and gave a single, slow nod. "It's an honest frame," he said, the highest praise he could bestow. "Built for a purpose."

His attention then shifted entirely to Chloe. He wasn’t interested in her celebrity; he was fascinated by the unique mechanical stresses her riding style produced. He asked her to describe the feeling of the frame flexing during the skid, the specific torsional forces she felt through the handlebars during a handstand. He spoke of rake and trail, of butted tubing and the resonant frequency of different steel alloys. It was a conversation so deeply technical, so beautifully nerdy, that Liam was practically vibrating with joy, occasionally interjecting with a question about bottom bracket stiffness that had clearly been plaguing him for years. Chloe, in turn, found herself describing the physical poetry of her riding in the cold, hard language of engineering. It was a new kind of translation, and it was deeply validating. By the end of the meeting, they hadn't discussed marketing or branding. They had agreed to a partnership, a collaborative project to design a frame that was not a replica, but an evolution—a frame that could withstand the unique punishment of her art. As they left, Marcus sent them off with a final, dry remark. "Most people who win a hundred thousand pounds buy a sports car," he said, a glint in his eye. "You two want to spend it building a better bicycle. You're my kind of people."

That sentiment, that they were finally being seen as 'their kind of people', propelled them through the next stage of their plan. The signing of the lease for the old hardware shop on Goldsworth Road was a terrifyingly official affair. They sat in a solicitor’s office that smelled of leather-bound books and dormant stress, confronted with a stack of documents thick enough to stop a door. Chloe, whose largest previous financial commitment had been the purchase of a new set of wheels, felt a wave of vertigo as the solicitor pointed to the places she needed to sign, her signature committing a significant chunk of her winnings to rent, rates, and service charges. But as she pushed the pen across the page, she caught Liam’s eye. He gave her a wide, conspiratorial grin, the same one he’d had on the night of the pizza dare, and the fear was replaced by a giddy, thrilling sense of shared rebellion. They were doing it. They were taking the system's money and funnelling it into their own quiet, two-person revolution. They walked out of the office blinking in the sunlight, clutching a small, unassuming set of keys that felt heavier and more valuable than the glass trophy ever had.

The work that followed was hard, dirty, and glorious. They attacked the derelict shop with a ferocious energy, fuelled by cheap tea and the sheer joy of creation. Liam, armed with a crowbar and a sledgehammer, was in his element, demolishing decades of rotting shelves and flimsy partition walls with the joyful abandon of a man finally given permission to break things for a living. Chloe discovered a different kind of flow, a meditative rhythm in the repetitive, physical tasks of scraping old, bubbled paint from the window frames and scrubbing years of grime from the floors. Their days were measured in sweat, sawdust, and progress. The cavernous, gloomy space began to transform. Light, for the first time in years, poured through the clean windows, illuminating a vast, open-plan space full of dust motes and potential. Their project did not go unnoticed. One afternoon, a young teenager on a BMX, who had been watching them from across the road, shyly approached the open door. "Are you the lady from the telly?" he asked, his voice cracking with nerves. When Chloe confirmed she was, he didn't ask for a selfie. Instead, he asked, "Do you need a hand sweeping up?" He became their first, unofficial Saturday boy, diligently sweeping floors in exchange for expert advice from Liam on how to fix his brakes. Mrs Higgins from downstairs would appear regularly at lunchtime, a one-woman catering corps, bearing a flask of soup and a foil-wrapped parcel of her legendary cheese scones, her presence a warm, lavender-scented blessing on their enterprise. The community they had feared would consume them was, instead, quietly helping them to build.

One crisp Saturday morning, Chloe took a break from painting and went for a ride, not to the industrial estate, but to the local park. She needed a change of scenery, a patch of green to offset the week’s dust and plaster. As she practiced a few slow, controlled track stands on a deserted basketball court, she became aware of a small figure watching her from a distance. It was a girl, no older than twelve, sitting on a bicycle that was slightly too big for her. She was trying to emulate Chloe, attempting to hold her balance while stationary, her bike wobbling precariously before she had to put a foot down, a look of intense frustration on her face. A few weeks ago, Chloe would have packed up and fled, the feeling of being watched an immediate trigger for her anxiety. But now, she saw not an intrusive fan, but a fellow cyclist struggling with a problem she knew how to solve. She pedalled slowly over to the girl. "It's harder than it looks, isn't it?" she said, her voice gentle. The girl nodded, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "I can't do it. My bike just wants to fall over." Chloe smiled. "That's because you're trying to be still," she explained. "The secret isn't stillness. It's constant, tiny adjustments. You turn the bars just a little, you shift your weight. You find your balance in the movement, not by fighting it." She demonstrated, her own bike held in a perfect, rock-steady track stand that was, in reality, a thousand micro-corrections. She spent ten minutes with the girl, talking her through the mechanics, praising her effort, watching as the girl's frustrated wobbles slowly began to smooth out into moments of sustained, triumphant balance. As she rode away, leaving the girl still practicing with a newfound determination, Chloe felt a new and unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest. It was the satisfaction of a teacher, the quiet joy of having passed on a small piece of her hard-won knowledge. It was another kind of work, and she realized, with a jolt of surprise, that she was good at it.Chapter 10

The final weeks of the renovation were a blur of purposeful chaos. The vast, empty shell of the hardware shop slowly filled with the substance of their dream. Professional electricians tamed the wild tangle of old wires, installing clean, bright track lighting that made the newly sanded wooden floors gleam. Plumbers wrangled ancient pipes into submission, culminating in the triumphant installation of a small but perfectly formed staff toilet, a luxury that felt more opulent to Liam than any five-star hotel. The walls, once a peeling testament to decades of neglect, were now a crisp, clean white, a blank canvas awaiting its art. Chloe, who had discovered a surprising talent for visual merchandising, spent hours arranging the first delivery of stock. She didn't just stack boxes of puncture repair kits; she curated them, creating small, artful displays of beautifully designed tools and brightly coloured handlebar tape, transforming mundane necessities into objects of desire. The space began to breathe, taking on a personality that was a perfect fusion of their two sensibilities: Liam’s pragmatic, mechanical order and Chloe’s quiet, aesthetic grace.

The arrival of the coffee machine marked a significant turning point in the project. It was a monstrous, gleaming beast of stainless steel, delivered by two grunting men who looked at it with a mixture of fear and reverence. Liam, who had studied its manual for weeks as if it were a sacred text, spent an entire afternoon plumbing it in, calibrating the grinder, and pulling dozens of "test" espresso shots. The first successful cup, rich and dark with a perfect, hazelnut-coloured crema, was a moment of profound ceremony. They stood in the middle of their dusty, half-finished shop, sipping the hot, potent liquid from mismatched mugs, the roar of the steam wand a triumphant fanfare announcing their arrival. A few days later, a large, second-hand Chesterfield sofa, procured for a bargain from a local pub that was closing down, was manoeuvred through the door. It was battered and worn, its dark green leather cracked and softened with age, but once settled in the sunny spot by the front window, it looked magnificent, an invitation to linger, to talk, to be a part of something. The shop was no longer just a retail space; it was becoming a clubhouse.

The package from Marcus Thorne arrived on a Tuesday, an unassuming, long cardboard box that belied the significance of its contents. Liam saw the courier van pull up and his face went pale, his hands, which could deftly rebuild a complex derailleur, suddenly clumsy as he signed the digital clipboard. They carried the box into the newly completed workshop at the back of the shop as if it contained a holy relic. With a reverence that bordered on comical, Liam sliced open the packing tape and slid the contents out onto a soft blanket laid on the floor. It was the frame. The first prototype of the ‘Circe Mk. II’. It was painted in a deep, lustrous gunmetal grey, a colour that seemed to absorb and hold the light. It was beautiful, but its beauty was secondary to its engineering. Chloe knelt and ran her hand along the top tube. She could see the subtle changes Marcus had made, the places where his conversations with her had been translated into steel. The down tube was slightly oversized, the chainstays were thicker and more robust, designed to handle the immense lateral forces of a skid. The head tube was reinforced, a subtle buttress against the stress of a handstand. It was her original bike, but stronger, more purposeful, its DNA rewritten by a master who had listened not just to her words, but to the unspoken language of her riding. Liam just stared, his mouth slightly agape, his mechanic’s eye seeing not just a frame, but a perfect solution to a thousand complex equations of force and stress. "He's a genius," he whispered, his voice full of pure, unadulterated awe. "It's perfect."

Building the prototype became Liam’s sole obsession. He worked late into the night in the new workshop, the bright lights spilling out into the dark back alley, the sound of a torque wrench clicking with quiet precision. He transferred the best components from Chloe’s original Circe, along with a few carefully chosen new parts, onto the new frame. He was not just assembling a bicycle; he was conducting a symphony, bringing each component into perfect harmony with the others. When he was finally finished, he wheeled it out into the main showroom and simply left it standing in the centre of the floor under a single spotlight. Chloe found it there the next morning when she arrived. It stood there, poised and powerful, a familiar soul in a new, stronger body. It looked less like a machine and more like a predator, coiled and ready. It was time for the test flight.

She took it to the industrial estate at dawn, the ritual now imbued with a new sense of professional duty. The air was cold, and her breath plumed in front of her. As she pushed off, she felt the difference immediately. The new frame was stiffer, more responsive. Every ounce of power she put through the pedals was transferred directly to the road with an exhilarating, brutal efficiency. There was no flex, no wasted energy. It felt like an extension of her own nervous system. She built up speed, the hum of the tyres a deeper, more resonant note than before. She swung into her first handstand, and the bike felt impossibly solid beneath her, a stable, unwavering platform. There was none of the subtle flex she was used to compensating for. The machine felt utterly dependable, a silent partner she could trust implicitly. Then, for the final test, she found a long, clear stretch of tarmac and pushed hard, building her speed until the world was a watercolour blur. She threw her weight back, locking her legs for the skid. The response was instantaneous and immense. The frame didn’t just withstand the force; it seemed to channel it, the bike biting into the tarmac, shuddering to a perfect, violent, controlled halt. She stepped off, her heart hammering not with fear, but with a pure, electric thrill. This wasn't just a better bike. It was *her* bike, forged from her own unique, crazy art. This was the work, made steel.

As she was completing a final, celebratory lap of the loop, a figure on a sleek carbon road bike appeared at the far end of the estate, coming towards her. Her old instinct, the urge to turn and flee from an intruder, flared for a split second before she suppressed it. The rider, kitted out in the serious gear of a club cyclist, slowed as they approached, their head tilted with curiosity. It was a woman in her forties, her face lean and weathered from thousands of miles in the wind. She didn't slow to stare or shout. She pulled up alongside Chloe, matching her pace. "That's the new frame, isn't it?" she asked, her voice calm and knowledgeable, nodding towards the gunmetal grey bike. "I read the article. Marcus Thorne is a legend. How does it handle the torque when you brake the back wheel like that? The chainstay must be incredibly rigid." The question was so specific, so perfectly 'inside baseball', that Chloe laughed, a sound of pure, unadulterated delight. The game had changed completely. She was no longer a curiosity. She was a peer, an expert, a test pilot whose feedback was valuable. She slowed to a stop, and for the next ten minutes, under the rising sun on a deserted industrial estate, she talked shop, an equal in a conversation she had always dreamed of having.That conversation, held in the crisp morning air, was the final piece of a puzzle Chloe hadn't even known she was solving. It cemented the shift inside her from a performer to a practitioner, from a novelty to a peer. When she returned to the nearly-finished shop, the prototype bike gleaming with a thin layer of road dew, she felt an authority she had never possessed before. The new frame, which Liam had taken to calling "The Greyback" in honour of its colour and wolf-like purposefulness, was no longer just a prototype. It was a statement of intent. They decided to mount it not in the window like a prize, but on a simple, unobtrusive wall rack deep within the shop, near the entrance to the workshop. It was a piece to be discovered, not advertised, a subtle nod to those who were there for the right reasons, for the work itself.

The Grand Opening, when it came, was a deliberately low-key affair. There were no press releases, no ribbons to be cut, no local dignitaries invited for a photo opportunity. Instead, a week beforehand, Chloe had simply taken a piece of brown card and, in her neat, precise handwriting, written ‘Woking Wheels. Opening Saturday, 10 AM. Coffee’s on us.’ She taped it to the inside of the front door. The invitation was not an announcement to the world, but a quiet word to the neighbourhood. The night before, a nervous, electric energy filled the completed shop. It was perfect. The lighting was warm, the stock was artfully arranged, the Chesterfield sofa looked as though it had been there for a hundred years, and the coffee machine gleamed with a quiet, powerful menace. But their shared anxiety was a palpable thing. It was a different fear from the one Chloe had felt on stage. This was the fear of the host who throws a party and worries no one will come, the fear of the entrepreneur who has staked everything on a single, fragile belief.

On Saturday morning, they arrived at dawn. Mrs. Higgins was already waiting for them, a large wicker basket in her arms, her face beaming. The basket was filled with dozens of her cheese scones, their savoury aroma the first official scent of the new shop. At precisely ten o’clock, after one last, frantic wipe of the counters, Liam took a deep breath, walked to the front door, and turned the handwritten sign around. He unlocked the door, propped it open, and they waited. For five long, agonizing minutes, nothing happened. The street outside was quiet. Then, the first person to walk through the door was the teenage BMXer, followed by three of his friends, all of them feigning a nonchalant cool that failed to hide their wide-eyed awe. A few minutes later, the woman from the industrial estate appeared, her cycling shoes clicking on the polished floor. She was followed by a slow but steady stream of people: young club cyclists, parents with kids on stabilisers, grizzled old-timers who remembered when bikes were made of heavier steel. They came for the free coffee, out of curiosity, or because they genuinely needed a new inner tube. They stayed because the atmosphere was warm, the welcome was genuine, and the talk was all about bikes.

Chloe had planned to stay behind the counter, a safe, transactional barrier between her and the public. But the shop wasn't that kind of place. She found herself drawn into conversations, not about the TV show, but about the best local routes, the merits of different tyre pressures, the simple joy of a well-oiled chain. A father, struggling to teach his daughter to ride, asked Chloe for advice. Before she knew it, she was on the shop floor, using a small child's bike to demonstrate the principle of looking where you want to go, not at your feet. The little girl, along with a small, captivated audience of other parents, listened with rapt attention. Chloe wasn't performing; she was teaching. She was demystifying her own seemingly magical skill, breaking it down into learnable, practical steps. In that moment, surrounded by a small, engaged circle of her own community, she felt more powerful and more herself than she ever had under a thousand spotlights.

Late in the afternoon, as the crowd was beginning to thin, a familiar figure appeared in the doorway. It was Eleanor Vance. She was dressed simply, in jeans and a jacket, and held a rolled-up magazine in her hand. She took in the scene—the sofa occupied by a group of cyclists arguing about gear ratios, Liam pulling an espresso shot like a seasoned barista, Chloe patiently explaining the mechanics of a pedal to a child—and a slow, knowing smile touched her lips. She made her way to the counter. "I was in the area," she said, her tone dry. "Thought I'd see if the coffee was as good as the hype." She unrolled the magazine. It was the latest print edition of ‘The Cadence’. Her article was the cover story. "I thought you should have a copy," she said, sliding it across the counter. "It seems you've already started writing the sequel." She bought a coffee, sat on the sofa for ten minutes listening to the conversations around her, gave Chloe a small, respectful nod, and left. Her visit was a quiet benediction, a final, full stop on the old story.

By the time they finally locked the door that evening, every bone in their bodies ached with a profound, satisfying weariness. The shop was a mess, a beautiful chaos of empty coffee cups, scone crumbs, and discarded packaging from the day's sales. The till was full, but that felt secondary. The true profit was in the feeling that lingered in the air, the warmth of a space that had, in the course of a single day, become exactly what they had hoped it would be: a hub, a haven, a home. Liam collapsed onto the Chesterfield sofa, his legs stretched out, a look of beatific exhaustion on his face. Chloe leaned against the counter, surveying their small, triumphant kingdom. Her gaze fell upon the original Circe, hanging on the wall of the workshop, her battle-scarred veteran. Then it moved to the new Greyback, leaning near the counter, ready for the next day's ride. They were not trophies. They were tools. They were the beginning and the continuation of the work. "Well," Liam said, his voice muffled by the leather cushions. "I think that went okay." Chloe smiled, a deep, bone-deep contentment spreading through her. The lights, the noise, the fear, it all felt like a story that had happened to someone else, a long time ago. She was home. And tomorrow, she would get up before dawn and she would go for a ride.
